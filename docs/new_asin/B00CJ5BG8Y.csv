5723375,2,B00CJ5BG8Y,"Not nearly incredible enough, this stylish but timid film promised a farcical rivalry between bickering and fading Vegas superstar magicians Burt Wonderstone (Steve Carell) and Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi) and an edgy upstart street magician named Steve Gray (Jim Carrey).  Of course one automatically thinks of former Vegas kings Siegfried & Roy and the current Criss Angel.

 But what held such high promise in the posters and trailers for a crazy, over-the-top illusionist smack-down switches gears before midpoint and becomes a treacley sweet redemption story that tracks Steve Carrell's Wonderstone through his humiliating fall from favor to the restoration of his cold heart and dead soul.  Jim Carrey is the only one who seems to get the proper tone of the film with his insane portrayal of a masochistic trickster whose gimmick is that he has none.  He really does burn and cut himself for the sake of the ""illusion.""  Olivia Wilde is a comely assistant who has little to do and Alan Akin steals the few scenes he's in as a curmudgeonly TV magician in a retirement home.  The outrageous stunt that precedes the final credits is what should have happened at midpoint.  Then we'd have something to talk about and a trigger that would escalate the story to a climax deserving of the great premise of crazed, battling Vegas magicians.

I was very disappointed at the relatively few ""tricks"" that were performed.  Whether practical or CGI, we want to be dazzled and amazed by cinematic magic when we fork over our hard-earned cold cash to be taken away in a story that promises big laughs and wonderment.  This is not a bad movie, it's just not magical in any way.  I did appreciate the quick disappearance of David Copperfield in a cameo, however.",1363651200,2,1754,4.908474576271186
5723376,4,B00CJ5BG8Y,"Since they first met in elementary school, Burt Wonderstone (Steve Carell) and Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi) have had a ""magical friendship.""  Burt first gets introduced to magic by his idol Rance Holloway (Alan Arkin) who tells him, via instructional video that ""everyone loves a magician,"" and because he's a nerdy, latchkey kid, finds this appealing.  Years later, the two have achieved their dream and are headlining Vegas with an act that has not changed an iota since they began (but which apparently everyone still finds fresh).  Burt has become an egotistical womanizer, while his partner chafes at his second banana status.  When a Jackass-like imposter, played by Jim Carrey appears on the scene  offering an irresistible alternative (he also uses a newfangled video camera to record the stunts), the pair is considered obsolete and dumped by their sponsor. Burt's character arc is identical to so many Will Ferrell roles, in which the guy whose ego needs serious deflating, must deal with a heavy load of Life Lessons in order to be redeemed and become a better person.

Will Ferrell could have done the Steve Carrell role in his sleep, and I found myself wishing that he was the lead instead.  Buscemi seems kind of out-of-it, and Jim's stunts didn't seem particularly dramatic, horrifying or repulsive in this day and age, when anything can be posted on YouTube.  My favorite character was Arkin, who brings dignity and humor to his small role. The plot is predictable, but there are amusing moments, and most of the people in my theater were laughing.  It's not a great movie, but not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you like magic.",1363651200,3,1656,4.885714285714286
5723377,3,B00CJ5BG8Y,"So what to make of Burt Wonderstone?  Steve Carell stars as the titular ""incredible"" and plays Wonderstone in all of his one-dimensional caricature and lacking any irony.  He's not unlikable even though he's completely out of touch and self-absorbed to the detriment of having any real personal relationship; if the movie would have taken the risk of making him unlikable it would have lost its lighter touches and felt less a comedy but certainly more personal and connectable.  Wonderstone doesn't work alone; he's a tag-team comedian a la Penn & Teller or other duo acts (mostly reminiscent of Sigfried and Roy though; though sequins were mesmerizing!).  His wizardly companion is Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi--probably giving the best perferomance here out of the whole cast--and sheepishly taking cheap shots around his snaggle-toothed bug-eyed looks), a buddy from childhood who got picked on and teased just like the young Burt did.  Marvelton is also Burt's brains and when the partnership finally breaks Wonderstone's posh and insulated carreer magically disappears (see what I did there? yeah, most of the jokes in the film are pretty weak too).

The remaining story is the return to infamy of Burt Wonderstone and his overcoming the David Blaine/ Criss Angel/ Marquis de Sade inspired freakworks of on-the-rise performer (""magician"" doesn't really apply) Steve Gray (an outlandish character played for some reason with too much restraint by rubber-faced Jim Carrey).  Olivia Wilde, doing some decent acting in some of the later scenes, plays Nicole...I mean Jane...Burt's love interest (love her eyes!) and the talented always underrated Alan Arkin shows up as the magician who inspired them all.

The ending of the film, with the protagonists pulling off their greatest magical feat (making the audience disappear...insert your own joke here), took me out of the movie as they showed us beforehand how they were doing it and, while it ends on a note that made me chuckle, this problem of allowing us to see the magic de-fanged takes away some of what could have been ZING at points in the movie, and that's too bad.

In summing up this movie I will say that there seemed to have been many missed opportunities...especially within the area of wowwing the audience with what appeared to be actual magic.  Good for a few, but just a few, laughs.",1363564800,,2356,5.080310880829016
5723378,5,B00CJ5BG8Y,"""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" movie centers around a plot involving the magician characters of Burt Wonderstone (Steve Carrell), Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi), Jane (Olivia Wilde), and Steve Gray (Jim Carey).  Steve Carrell and Steve Buscemi give off the wall but convincing performances as magicians who also happen to be both business partners and best friends. Olivia Wilde also gives a natural performance as a woman who is pretty much hoodwinked into working for Burt Wonderstone and Anton Marvelton.  However, she also plays a reliable friend who stands by Burt Wonderstone in circumstances where other men and women might have bailed on him.  Jim Carey shrewdly plays an eccentric magician that serves both a humorous and unconventional role in giving great competition to Burt Wonderstone.  Carey's Gray character also helps to eventually bring out the best in Burt Wonderstone on a professional level.  Yes, it is just a movie, but I believe that the competition and enemies part also applies in real-life.  When seen in a positive light, enemies and competition can bring out the brilliance in a person via professional, spiritual, and/or emotional levels.  ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is a film that is good for those who like zany comedy movies.",1363392000,4,1269,5.2835820895522385
5723379,4,B00CJ5BG8Y,"""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" (2013 release; 100 min.) brings the story of Burt Wonderstone (played by Steve Carell) and Anton Marvelton (played by Steve Buscemi), friends since childhood and now a headling magic act at the Bally's in Las Vegas. Think of Burt and Anton as Siegfried and Roy without the tigers. But their popularity starts to wane when a street magician named Steve Gray (played by Jim Carrey)--think along the lines of David Blaine--comes onto the scene. After a badly failed attempt to regain the momentum, Anton quits and Burt now must try to survive without his magic act partner. To tell you much more of the plot would be pointless. If you've seen the trailer of the movie, you know pretty much exactly how it's all going to play out.

Several comments: the plot of the movie is utterly predictable but that is not the point of this movie. Indeed the heart and soul of the movie lies in the staging of the various magic tricks and acts. As we get deeper and deeper into the movie, Steve Gray goes more and more extreme, which in turn prompts Burt and Co. to try and match. The last part of the movie is an outright ""magic-off"" between Steve and Burt (with assorted friends). The secondary, and more wistful, point of the movie is the life-long friendship between Burt and Anton. The opening scenes of the movie show us how they become friends as boys in the 1980s and these scenes are just wonderful and nostalgic (in the best sense).

One of the reason the movie works so well is that we are treated to an all-star cast which simply delivers. Let's start with Steve Carell. Let me note upfront that I will go see just about anything with him in it (and last year's ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" might have been his best performance ever). As it happens, Carell plays a character who is very unlikeable for most of the movie, and pulls it off! Steve Buscemi does great as the ""sidekick"". Jim Carrey steals a number of scenes with his over-the-top character of the Davie Blaine-alike Steve Gray. But wait! there is more! Olivia Wilde as the ""magician's assistant"" just oozes charm and is utterly delightful. Alan Arkin as the statesman elder magician brings yet another short but impactful role, like so many recently (Argo, anyone?). Last but not least, James Gandolfini as the casino owner finally gets to play a non-mafia/mob role and is great. Bottom line is that I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. No, this is not art with a capital A, but it is mindless entertainment that delivers what it promised: a movie about, with featuring plenty of great, magic acts and tricks. And the all-star cast certainly didn't hurt!",1363305600,6,2667,4.636363636363637
5723380,2,B00CJ5BG8Y,"""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is the worn out story of a young boy discovering magic to make up for his inability to mesh well with society. His magic attracts another boy who is the only kid in school nerdier than he is and a magical friendship is born. Ten years later and the two of them are headlining one of the biggest hotels in Las Vegas. But in the present day, Burt Wonderstone (Steve Carell) and his over inflated ego have more than taken their toll on his partner Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi). Their dated act is overshadowed by the sickening antics of an obnoxious street magician named Steve Gray (Jim Carrey). Now with a five year contract on the line, it's a magician's battle royal to see who can be proclaimed the king of Las Vegas.

This film is like one big, unfunny jab at Siegfried and Roy. The suggestive commentary becomes overwhelming only ten minutes in. You witness Burt and Anton's act a total of three times and it isn't anything to brag about the first time around. Are they taking volunteers for the hangman illusion? You might consider signing up just to make it easier to get away from this monstrosity sooner.

All of the humor rests on the shoulders of Steve Carell, Steve Buscemi, and Jim Carrey who only seem to act like jackasses whenever the camera is put on them. The humor feels too juvenile to properly hit its mark. ""Oh, I have to pee,"" ""My bed is the biggest in Vegas,"" and ""we've been together so long that I can't stand the sight of you."" The rest of the time the comedy is just yelling and making stupid faces, which loses what little charm it had to begin with once Steve Gray doesn't blink for like 72 hours and shoots pepper spray in his eyes.

Alan Arkin is the best part of this dog and pony show, but even he seems like he doesn't really want to be there. There are a few snicker worthy moments while Burt Wonderstone is trying to adjust to being poor and the restaurant scene where Burt and Anton are reunited is slightly humorous, but is really just expanded on from a bit in ""Anchorman.""

""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is the age old tale of out with the old and in with the new and is mostly just a groansfest from beginning to end. Grown individuals shouting at each other, stomping around, and acting childish when they don't get their way gets massively tiresome really fast and ""Burt Wonderstone"" doesn't know when to quit while it's ahead. ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is just a delusional illusion of passable entertainment.",1363305600,2,2502,4.553333333333334
5723381,5,B00CJ5BG8Y,"The Incredible Burt Wonderstone is a great and funny movie. I found my self laughing out loud more then I can count (and I can count pretty high.) Down below I have some goods and bads about the movie.

Good:
-Steve Carrel might have put on one of his best comedic performance
- When Jim Carrey is in the film, he is halarious
-Wilde, Buscemi, and all the other supporting actors do a great job
- There were many other great things

Bad:
-Jim Carrey had very limited time on the screen, unlike it would suggested in the trailers and tv spots.

So overall the movie was truly Incredible. I would suggest anyone to go see this movie.",1363305600,4,631,4.330508474576271
5723382,1,B00CJ5BG8Y,"There are some actors that are better off staying on television.  It's a fact, because there's obviously a massive difference between movies and television.  No - this isn't going to be a lecture about poor acting, but it is a reminder that television success does not always translate well to the big screen.  Yes, movie stars have occasionally made the trip to television (which works, sometimes), but movie-goers and TV watchers have difference expectations.  If a television show has a bad episode, they can possibly right the ship in the next episode or even the following season - but failure on the big screen is a much grander debacle because it's permanent.  The Incredible Burt Wonderstone is a perfect example of TV stars failing miserably on the big screen.  Wonderstore features actors/actress that either are or have been successful on television.  With that point being stated, we will continue with this subject in a moment, but first...here's the synopsis for The Incredible Burt Wonderstone.

Directed by Don Scardino (NBC's 30 Rock), The Incredible Burt Wonderstone stars Steve Carell  as Burt Wonderstone, a successful Las Vegas magician that began practicing magic as a boy.  Along with his stage partner and best friend, Anton Marvelton (Steve Busemi), the pair stars in a once popular magic show that goes stale and becomes too predictable to maintain an audience.  Eventually, the lack of success forces the pair to end their friendship and go their separate ways.  At the same time, a new ""magician,"" Steve Gray (Jim Carrey), comes to town with a ""shock-and-awe"" street act that garners a great deal of attention - essentially putting Wonderstone's act out of business.  Trying to find his confidence and revitalize his career, Wonderstone attempts to rekindle his friendship with his former friend/partner and take back the spotlight.  Olivia Wilde, Alan Arkin, and James Gandolfini also star in supporting roles.

Unless you're a fan of The Office, Steve Carell can be a tough individual to digest - mostly because his brand of humor is so awkward (often times dry) that viewers easily be turned off by it.  However, in his defense, he's usually one of those actors that you either love or hate - possibly love to hate.  Keep in my, most of his fans enjoyed his television performance on The Office, but since he's left the show, he has obviously made the transition to film - with a series of questionable roles.  In typical Carell fashion, his new role as Burt Wonderstone is on par with the roles he usually plays in film and on television, as a sort of outcast that lacks confidence, yet somehow rises to the occasion to achieve his goal just in time for the credits to roll.

As it pertains to Wonderstone, this film is by far and away Carell's worst film role to date.  This particular comedy (if you should even call it that) is a combination of a poorly written script (not to mention ridiculous plot) and a bland sense of humor.  His attempt to create laughs in this film is feeble and childish, making for a long, long viewing experience.  Steve Busemi's presence in this film is also quite out of place, since he's currently pretty well-known as playing the leading role in the HBO gangster drama, Boardwalk Empire.  And, while this should have been an easy role for Busemi to pass on, there he is in all of his dull-witted, poorly written glory - and not nearly as entertaining as his previous cameos in films, such as Grown Ups or I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.  The only saving grace (in the acting department) is Olivia Wilde and James Gandolfini (also both television stars on the big screen), who are both charming and amusing in their respective roles.  And, let's not forget to mention the always delightful wit of Alan Arkin, who is always a treat to watch.

Anytime you're going to watch a film, you should always give a film the benefit of the doubt before judging it, but Wonderstone fails in every single department.  Not only does Wonderstone fail to deliver the laughs, it fails miserably with the plot.  The ending is even more bothersome, since it lacks the ""wow"" factor that should come from a movie about magic - and frankly, it will have you thinking about making a quick break for an exit.  If there was ever a movie that you should save your money on...look no further than The (less than) Incredible Burt Wonderstone.

P.S. - For those wondering about Jim Carrey's role - complete letdown is the nicest way to describe it.

5723383,3,B00CJ5BG8Y,"MAY BE SPOILERS BELOW!!!!  Though I try to keep main things out.

Ok, my mom and I were going to see a movie.  I had no clue what this was about or when it came out.  I saw something on one of the late shows last night.  It had Jim Carrey talking and showing a scene.  The scene made me want to see the movie.  Oh how much of a mistake that was.  Ok, I guess I should tell you why.  Read on!

This movie had so many things happening, it felt like I was spazzing out on sugar and every time I would come back into reality, it would be a different movie.  Here is what is happening in this movie.

1. A boy with no friends and a busy mom gets something that gives him joy.

2. While doing something from what he got for his birthday, he meets another boy.  They become friends.

3. Time goes by and they become magicians.

4. Over time they start fading away and having less of a crowd.

5. The man looses his friend and tries to do his act alone.

6. Man meets the man that made him what he is.

7. Man starts to fall for a lady that works with him.

8. Man is being out done by a freaking moron who does things to hurt himself.

9. Man has to realize that things must change over time and everyone is important.

Got it?  That is the movie.  Now, seems simple enough right?  Wrong.  I did laugh at parts of this movie.  As did some of the other people in the theater.  But I have the weirdest feeling that I was watching a drama.  I kind of sat there like a zombie.  Some of the things they do is just dumb.  Like when the friend leaves and the man is doing the two man show by himself.  You can see him climb the stairs on his hands and knees.  It was stupid.  ALL the things that Jim Carrey's character did, just made me feel uncomfortable.  He did things that were very intense and would kill someone if they tried it.  The last thing he did, was one of the stupidest things I have ever seen.  Nothing about it was funny.  The audience just sat there silent.  The things that the two men do to try and win a contest at the end, while it was funny, is taken to far when at the very end, you see them doing things to people in order for the trick to work.  That was a common thing with this movie.  They just went on for to long with a single thing  On and on and on.  So many little things happen that I found myself asking why?  This would have been a lot better if they had kept the character that Jim Carrey played out of the movie.  It just made it feel cheap and sleazy.  I think that character ruined the movie.  You get the feeling that you are watching some stupid teenage thing on youtube when his parts come on.  The thing I saw on the late show was not what I thought it was.  Once again, they took it to far.

The title of this review, the movie felt SO long.  Yet, I feel like I learned nothing and honestly have no clue what happened.

I have a feeling that if I would have been seeing this by myself, I would have laughed much more.  If I saw it at home, I would laugh and laugh.  Sometimes having an audience can effect your mood.  When everyone just sat there quiet, it killed the mood.  I will buy then on blu ray when it comes out and give it another try.  But as for seeing it in a theater and paying almost $9 a ticket, all I can say is go with the right person.  Someone with an almost Airplane type of humor.  Other wise you may end up feeling like I did.

Rethinking
I was eating dinner and thinking about this movie.  I think the problem was I did not know the type of comedy it was going to be.  It is very spoof.  The stuff Jim Carrey does is the way it has to be.  His character does shock stuff to get peoples attention.  One of the characters even says he is an idiot.  The stuff when Carells character is doing his act on his own is supposed to look dumb.  He is doing a two man act alone.  So after thinking about what I saw I have come to the conclusion that the movie was funny.  I will buy it when it comes out.

As for what the first person who reviewed this, I would NEVER take a kid to see this movie.  Some of the things are very violent.  While adults can see the difference, I do not believe kids would.",1363305600,6,4146,3.933414043583535

Great cast, great direction and lots of blink-and-you'll-miss-it moments in the screenplay.  Yes, Jim Carrey is perfect as the up and coming street entertainer who mostly specializes in various forms of self-mutilation, and whose act is garnering an audience, totally eclipsing the established magic show of Burt and Anton, played by Steve Carrel and Steve Buscemi.  Burt and Anton became friends as young kids who were bullied and found that learning magic tricks provided a defense and a level of social acceptance.  As adults, they became residents of  Bally's Las Vegas, living at the hotel and entertaining audiences for years.  Eventually, a few things start to happen around the same time.  Carrey's character, named Steve Gray, gains in popularity while Burt and Anton see their ticket sales decline.  Burt and Anton also become bored with their routine, bickering backstage even as the audiences applaud. Their female assistant quits, which is evidently getting to be a pattern, and one of the technical staffers, Jane, played by Olivia Wilde, is pressed into service as the newest ""Nicole.""  The three characters soon go separate ways only to reunite under changed circumstances that provide added layers of richness to the movie.  I don't agree that anything about this movie is predictable; in fact, I think that parts of this movie are easy to turn away from, at the expense of fully appreciating this texture and richness.  The more obvious themes, such as friendship, romantic interest, treating elderly with respect, nostalgia - if you focus on just the top notes then yes, I can see where critics find it predictable.  The genius of this movie lies in the sublayer of twisted character development that takes place which includes the ending.  The ending of this movie should make your jaw drop - what are they doing to the audience?  What is this movie saying about what kind of people these really are?  What is that saying about audience mentality?  With the happy 70s disco-era Pilot song, ""Magic"" playing in the background?  Ending is so brilliant you will forgive having to hear ""Abracadabra"" played several times earlier for the act's opening

5723433,1,B00CJ5BG8Y,"There is an old saying that says, ""too many cooks in the kitchen spoil the broth"". This is an apt metaphor to describe the Incredible Burt Wonderstone. While I'm not crazy about magicians, how could you not be excited for a comedy starting Steve Carrell and Jim Carrey? They are certainly two of the best comedic actors around and I hoped this film would be a can't miss, but it was far from it. In a parallel situation, Carrell and Carrey are trying to one up each other in the same way that Wonderstone and Gray are in the film. This results are a film that is sloppy and a complete waste of time and talent. The story takes place in Las Vegas, where for twenty years Burt Wonderstone (Steve Carrell) has been the only name in magic. One day a newbie appears on the scene, one with a TV show and a high risk element to his act. Steve Gray (Jim Carrey) makes Wonderstone appear old and outdated, inspiring Burt to up his game. This film simply wasn't funny at all, as the producers tried to pit David Copperfield against Criss Angel. It was an interesting idea for a film, just not a comedy, because magic simply isn't funny. Watching these guys share idiotic dialogue, while they perform stupid tricks, that nobody would want to see, isn't funny. There isn't much more to say other than this film was a complete bust, with almost no redeeming qualities what so ever. I am still in a state of shock, that a movie with so many comedic stars could turn out to be this bad, but it really does prove that too many cooks is never a good thing. I'm sure the cast all had their own ideas and all tried to interject their own unique styles into the film, but it simply didn't work.",1443225600,,1674,4.334394904458598

A jaded, once-successful Vegas magician and his sidekick (Steve Buscemi and Steve Carell)  former token schoolyard victims who used to believe in the magic of, well, magic  must change tack when an obnoxious street magician threatens their cheesy, tanned brand of trickery.

What did I think?

Is THAT your card, sir? In what could have easily been a parody worse than the kitschy, dated magic scene its sending up, The Incredible Burt Wonderstone delivers handsome LOLs as well as an arbitrary saccharine tale of caring about whats important  or something  which fortunately doesnt get in the way of the humour too much.

Under the sharp direction of Don Scardino (30 Rock), the leading Steves, Carell and Buscemi, are stellar as the bickering, washed-up illusionists but Jim Carrey very nearly steals the show as the alternative  and, of course, entirely evil (hey, we came for laughs, not character depth!)  new face of extreme magic.

5723480,3,B00CJ5BG8Y,"I love magic acts and since Las Vegas is one of the capitals of stage magic, a movie about magicians there is a natural draw for me.  Having seen ""the Incredible Burt Wonderstone,"" I think it was an okay flick with some amusing performances and a pretty good message about performers needing to love what they do day in and day out if they want to ""sell"" their performances to their audiences.

With this said, the movie sabotaged itself some by veering into totally unrealistic moments.  One of them is with the Wonderstone character himself.  He comes across a such a total caricature of what a vainglorious stage performer might be, I thought it undermined the movie's credibility.

Then there's some of the magic...

<spoilers>

Some of the tricks and illusions were pretty cool but some of them were truly ridiculous and simply aren't possible.  The ""disappearing audience"" trick that is the grand finale is the worst example.  The trick is that Wonderstone and friends use a fictional knock out gas on the audience and transport the unconscious people out to the desert where they wake to their surprise and then they do it again to bring them back to the theater.

That is so preposterous, it takes willing suspension of disbelief beyond where it can go.  Knocking out hundreds of people with gas could never ever happen (ever hear of laws, movie makers?).  And then I wonder if the screenwriters heard about what happened when the Russians with a situation in Moscow where Chechen terrorists had taken over a theater there and were holding the audience hostage.  The Russians used fentanyl (a real knockout gas) to subdue the terrorists and free the hostages.  It worked, but 130 hostages died because one of the byproducts of getting knocked out like that is having adverse reactions to the chemicals.

Having watched a documentary about that ""Terror in Moscow"" (which is well worth seeing), I couldn't help but cringe when I saw Wonderstone and his friends gassing the crowd and treating their unconscious guests like store mannequins as they loaded them up on the trucks.

<spoilers end>

So were it up to me, I would have avoided so-impossible-it's laughable gags in the movie and done the same basic story real magic tricks and illusions.  It would have made for a better movie in my book.",1414800000,,2302,4.814249363867685

5723504,3,B00CJ5BG8Y,"Jim Carrey's a supporting player in THE INCREDIBLE BURT WONDERSTONE (2013), the story of a team of spangly Las Vegas magicians who have been doing the same act for a decade and have grown stale.

Steve Gray (Carrey) by contrast is a street performer whose brand of magic is primarily self-mutilation, a choice that's his undoing in the end. For the moment however, he attracts enormous crowds, much as car wrecks do. This part of the story is very dark, not for the squeamish, and where the film is supposed to amuse there really are few laughs. In general it's a melancholy story, one of frustration and failure that a calculated happy ending doesn't fully redeem.

As for Burt (Steve Carell) and partner in prestidigitation Anton (Steve Buscemi), these friends since boyhood have come to loathe each other. As their audience dwindles to a few oldsters, Anton wants to liven things up, to break free of the same old patter and tired tricks. Burt's giant ego won't allow him to agree and ultimately the two split after a heavily publicized outdoor stunt turns disastrous. Bizarrely, Burt continues the act alone and unchanged. He talks to a partner who's no longer there to answer, and tries to perform two-man tricks alone.

The owner of the hotel & casino (James Gandolfini) that has been the home of Burt and Anton all these years fires the clueless Burt. It's just another step on the quick road to rock bottom oblivion for the ""incredible"" Burt Wonderstone, and it may take more than magic to restore him.

Help comes from the unlikeliest place when Burt meets his boyhood idol, magician Rance Holloway (Alan Arkin) who's now a crochety old man. Rance agrees that Gray is no magician, but he has his doubts about Burt, too...",1404518400,,1730,4.756666666666667

A new act comes on the scene, steals Burt audience and suddenly he is down and out and struggling to get by with funny results. How he manages to get back into the game again is hilarious, but I think it is a good story about how it's important to remember where you came from, who helped you get there, and remembering why it was so important to you.",1395792000,,767,4.224489795918367

Steve Carell is the lead magician and his partner is an old childhood friend who followed him into a career in magic.  Of almost nostalgic interest, James Gandolfini plays the manager of the casino resort where they do their nightly act, and does a fine job with his bit part.

The Wonderstone act is starting to get a bit stale and then, Bang! along comes unexpected competition in the form of a rogue ""street magician"" played by Jim Carrey.  Carrey brings his usual manic, hyper-intense persona to this character.  Soon our magician pair are sniping at each other and then find themselves out of a job as Gandolfini hires Carrey's ""street magician"" to replace them.

In the end it's about (that's right, a morality play) learning that friendships are more important than ego (or money) as Wonderstone realizes he's no good as a solo act and he needs his long-time friend to back him up.

In the movie, we begin with a school age Albert (Burt) Wonderstone being bullied by classmates.  He receives a ""Rance Halloway"" magic set for his birthday and is so thrilled...now he has a way to make everyone like him!

Well, the only one who seems to like him is his new friend, played by Steve Buscemi.  They grow up doing magic tricks together...and finally discover fame and fortune in Sin City as The Incredible Burt Wonderstone and Anton Marvelton:  A MAGICAL FRIENDSHIP!

However......underneath the public ""magical friendship,"" Burt and Anton have started to loathe each other....mostly due to Burt Wonderstone's incredible growing ego!

Yes, Burt Wonderstone has turned into a very unlikable  oaf.  Plus, he has grown weary of performing magic - the thrill, as they say, is gone for him.

Enter Jim Carey's character:  a guerilla street magician who delivers thrills during his edgy new-style magic show called Brain Rapist.  Brain Rapist is really more about gross outs and pure endurance as opposed to real magic...but no matter...the younger audience loves his act.  They love it a lot more than the ""old fashioned"" sort of magic delivered by Burt Wonderstone and Anton Marvelton!

So there is the set-up for this movie.  There is also a woman involved, along with Alan Arkan playing Rance Halloway, the old-time magician who first sparked Burt's love of magic.

Can Rance help Burt rediscover his love of magic?

Will Burt and Anton become ""magical friends"" once again?

But most importantly, IS THIS MOVIE FUNNY?

Well, I'll tell you.....I found the movie funnier the SECOND time I watched it!  Maybe I expected too much the first time I watched.  Yes, there are laughs.  No, the movie is NOT boring.  However, don't expect to be laughing hysterically the whole time - that's not going to happen!

There are problems with this movie (which could be why it's so cheap)!  Number one, a lot of the jokes seem a bit clich.  And number two - none of the main characters are particularly likable...especially Burt Wonderstone himself!  He is a horribly unlikable character...at least for the first half of the movie.

Jim Carrey's character is even MORE unlikable!  He plays his part with a creepy grimness that isn't very funny....it's just disturbing.

Things haven't been going all that well for Burt Wonderstone (Steve Carell) of late. His lucrative two-man Las Vegas magician act has fallen on hard times, what with his partner and lifelong best friend, Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi), quitting the act over long-unresolved personal and professional differences. Hes also up against  a daredevil stuntman (Jim Carrey) whos recently come to town and is making Winderstones act look mighty quaint and blas&eacute; in comparison.

Written by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein and directed by Don Scardino, The Incredible Burt Wonderstone takes awhile to find its footing (after a brief but charming prologue set in the duos childhood), but once it does, it turns into an endearing feel-good comedy that finds a proper balance between humor and sentiment, laughter and tears most of the way through.

The three stars make the most of their well-written roles, and Olivia Wilde, Alan Arkin and James Gandolfini offer first-rate support. Wonderstone is not exactly a laugh-riot, but there are more than enough chuckles to satisfy even the most curmudgeonly viewer.",1382918400,,1125,5.338983050847458

5723587,3,B00CJ5BG8Y,"It has been a very long time since a newer comedy movie actually made me laugh. I can think of precious few with the exception of the new 2011's ""The Muppets."" So, it was with low expectations yet high hopes that I sat down to watch ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"". Ladies and gentlemen, laughter was achieved.

Young Albert is a loser. He is beaten up and made to eat bark not sixty seconds after we meet him. His mother is never home and he has to bake is own tenth birthday cake. His only outlet is a Rance Holloway Magic Set. He soon meets Anthony, another outcast who, according to doctors is ""dangerously close to being a girl"". Through the years their friendship and love of magic grows until they become ""The Incredible Burt and Anton"" working their way up the magician's ranks around the world. Burt is soon contracted to Bally's Casino in Las Vegas and Burt agrees but only as long as Anton comes too. ""We are a team. Always have been always will be.""

Cut to a decade later and the ""magic"" is gone. Burt and Anton have done the same exact show every night for ten years. Burt (Steve Carrell) has become a petulant prima donna who abuses his friend and only cares about getting the show over with so he can sleep with an audience member. Anton (Steve Buscemi) tries to go with the flow, but Burt keeps firing assistants. ""That's the second one this month!"" Anton complains.

Enter Steve Gray (Jim Carrey) a street magician and Criss Angel clone with a cable T.V. show ""Brain Rapist"". He's new and exciting, never mind that he doesn't do any actual magic tricks. ""He just mumbles and cuts himself. My niece does that"", Burt scoffs. But that doesn't matter to casino owner Doug (James Gandolfini). ""You guys are doing the same [crap] as when I hired you."" He wants something new.

From here the plot is pretty standard. The duo breaks up, a romantic interest is introduced, and Steve Gray taunts them at every turn. But here's the thing. It doesn't feel stale. Yes, the notes are all there, but they are played with a lighter touch. The dialogue is witty instead of mechanical and the sentimentality is far less forced. The actors play their roles with a gusto rarely seen in this age of cookie cutter comedies and the typical beats are measured out to a different timing than we are used to. Will Steve Gray get his comeuppance? Will Burt and Anton change, grow, forgive, and rejoin forces to get the ""big gig""? Will the two romantic leads get together in the end? We know the answers, but the way the movie gets us there is refreshing and humorous. The ending itself is slapstick of the highest order, changing the tone of the final triumph completely and in the best way possible.

Hands down some of the best moments belong to Alan Arkin as Rance Holloway. Watching him in the previews for this movie I read his character one way, but in the movie he is a different animal altogether and they are both equally side splitting. Alan Arkin is a master of dry humor and with little to no perceivable effort he can change a line from self-deprecating to a barb at his co-star without changing a word.

As a final word about the actors, this is the funniest I have seen some of these actors in a very long time. Carrey, Carrell, and Buscemi have returned to quality comedy with this offering and I hope they do not go back to the dim witted sentimental schlock we saw from them in other stages of their respective careers. I'm looking at you, ""Mr. Popper's Penguins"".

""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is not perfect. It may push a couple of its jokes a trifle too far, but this movie was obviously made with an eye on quality and laughs rather than pumping out a quick product of dubious entertainment value. If I had to have a complaint it would be that some of the CG is pretty cheap, but honestly the material was so good I found myself forgiving the obvious effects. Modesty aside, I wanted to watch it again as soon as it was over. Now, that's an impressive trick.",1382313600,,3979,4.48

I loved seeing Steve Carrell, Steve Buscemi, and Jim Carey prancing about in long, luxurious wigs, spoofing on all the stereotypes of the flamboyant magician. Alan Arkin also does a great job as Rance Holloway, very funny stuff! To me, Jim Carey stole the show as up and coming street illusionist Steve Gray. His array of absurd ""tricks"", such as becoming a human pinata, were just the right touch of poking fun at the ""Mind Freak"" guy. His personality was hilarious, as was his ridiculous appearance, including chain tattoos across his body and rock star hair. Yes, the movie is predictable and rather sophomoric, but that's what it's supposed to be... this is a comedy designed to be silly and outrageous, not ""Gone With The Wind"".

Also noteworthy was James Gandolfini's role. I'm not sure if this was his last role before his untimely passing, but if so, he went out on a high note. He's still likable and funny as he portrays his character, despite the fact that there is nothing whatsoever likable about the character himself- testimony to Gandolfini's extraordinary charisma.

Olivia Wilde is actually a nice reprieve in this would-be Blockbuster.",1376697600,,450,5.6716417910447765

This movie isn't breaking any new group and is hardly breathtaking, but if you're looking for an upbeat movie with some laughs - then this could probably quench that thirst.

Steve Carell delivers, as usual, a very sturdy and funny performance. Jim Carrey does Jim Carrey best by playing a very outlandish and over-the-top magician as well. The supporting characters are enough to keep you at least interested in the continuing plot of the movie and your main stars.

The movie also has some nice slight-of-hand and magic tricks involved, and generally - it's a fun movie. It's worth a watch, but don't expect it to change your life forever. Oh yeah, plus Olivia Wilde. Nice.",1376697600,,814,4.848920863309353

Unanimously, FB friends advised us to move on instead of watching on. It was a GREAT concept. But it was TERRIBLY written. Give these guys some good lines and some funny scenes, and they CAN deliver. But, sadly, both were painfully lacking. Instead, it was a boring thumb-nosing at the magic ""industry"" that was a waste of 37 minutes of our lives.

Then there are movies where the actors read the script, ask their agents ""how much are they willing to pay me again?"" and go for it, mailing everything in.  The latter scenario describes ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone,"" which considering its fairly high caliber of acting power boils down to nothing more than an extremely predictable riches-to-rags-to-redemption story.

Two nerdy eighties kids obsessed by a mail order magician's kit grow up to be Burt Wonderstone (a glammed-up Steve Carell) and Anton Marvelton (a less glammed-up Steve Buscemi), the magician superstars of the Vegas strip.  However, offstage they hate each other and their popularity among the flyover crowds who adore them is being threatened by Steve Gray (Jim Carrey, who fifteen years ago would have starred in this), a ""street magician"" in the mold of Criss Angel and David Blaine, whose idea of magic is pulling a playing card out of a self-inflicted facial wound and holding his urine for weeks.  After an attempt at edgy magic goes awry, Burt and Anton go their separate ways, Anton distributing magic kits to third world children and Burt reduced to entertaining at a nursing home for former Vegas performers.  Lo and behold, the magician who inspired him as a child (Alan Arkin) lives at the home and ... I'm sure you can guess the rest.

""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" isn't horrible, it's just REALLY predictable.  I felt bad for Olivia Wilde, who's the only one that turns in a credible performance--she's also the only one who delivered a line that made me laugh.  However, her character also becomes reduced to cliche.  I'm no comedy snob, considering my all-time favorite movie is ""Amimal House,"" but ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is just another in a very long line of multiplex filler between the summer blockbuster season and the serious award season.  It's not memorable, not particularly funny, but if you want to pass two hours I guess it fits the bill.",1376179200,,2059,4.991228070175438

Not to mention Alan Arkin and Steve Buscemi. But this film turned out to be wonderfully written, absolutely spot-on brilliant in many places, and exceptionally well acted. I particularly loved the beautiful sequence with Steve Carell and Alan Arkin practicing real sleight-of-hand tricks - the way real magicians still do. It was quite a lovely homage to the world of magic. But I have to say Jim Carrey stole the movie with his spot-on Steve Grey. I won't spoil it for you to say who he was parodying, but his performance, attitude, even his gliding through the bar as if on magic rollers, was absolutely brilliant. For me, he made this film and I adore Steve Carell, but I have to say Jim Carrey stole it from Steve this time :-{ I think this film will turn out to be one of those films that people remember years later as a gem among the lame comedies we usually come to see in this day and age.

I saw it in a little store in the city I live and I paid $3 for it and after watching it I was glad I didn't pay more.

The character beautifully played by Steve Carell is a mix of David Copperfield and Liberace, very likeable indeed and funny in many parts, but the star of this movie is Jim Carey, doing what he does best playing his over the top magician in a very campy and crazy way, which is very much of a caricature of magicians like Chris Angel, David Blane, etc.
I enjoyed the movie but the repetition of the numbers and music became old very quickly, I know it was part of the plot to show that their act was outdated but for us (me) who are watching the movie it was boring, but I loved the costumes and the presence of Mr. Alan Arkin.

5723812,2,B00CJ5BG8Y,"First off, I really hate critiquing bad flicks. I just don't see the reason to do it. But I have to this....

Carell, Wilde, Buscemi, Arkin, and Carrey...how did the writers screw up a film with stellar cast?????

First, Carrey is the brightest spot in this flick as a shock street performer, and does a great job as a supporting actor. He actually plays his moronic self (drilling into his skull), and he works as a street idiot magician that is a blatant slam to Criss Angel. From there, I cannot believe the rest of this A-List cast signed for this Formula Hollywood fiasco. I like Carell movies (brilliant in Seeking a Friend for The End of The World), I think Buscemi is one of the most underrated actors of our age (but he looks like this role is phoned in), and who doesn't love Arkin? BTW, somebody had to have something on Wilde to get her to do this film.

With THIS kind of talent, the story of a jaded self centered fallen magician could have been hilarious. Instead, it was simply a formula film that you KNEW the soggy script in the first five minutes. I kept waiting for this to take the road to insanity funny, but it kept sinking into a new version of a lame kids show.

Here are the highlights...Arkin is really funny in his role as a retired magician in an old folks home, especially in his `I had a stroke' bit, and then the last 3 minutes. That's it. I have a feeling the original script may have been more bizarre, and Hollywood made it cream toast.

Oh, the OTHER best performance in this film is Jay Mohr's spot shots as the magician Rick the Implausible. He NAILS the role with his spoof on Vegas lounge performers with his comb-over and inability to tell a single joke properly. And I mean he nails it. If they had shown him blowing it on stage, instead of just the bar spots, this would have been funnier.

I gave this 2 stars simply for Carrey, Mohr, and Arkin. I won't give you a synopsis of the movie, because I am sure you can guess it it from the other comments. I would recommend you have many many drinkies before watching the dvd. Might make it funnier. Okay, I mean you REALLY need to be hammered to find the humor in this Hollywood formula dog.

Funny throughout with notably great performances from Carrey and Arkin - there is charm, warmth and a genuine appreciation for the craft of magic here. I consider it a nice bonus that it's a comedy I feel comfortable enjoying with my two kids (aged 8 and 6).

Implausible? Yes.
Often times stupid? Yes.
Entertaining? Most definitely.

5723876,3,B00CJ5BG8Y,"*Spoilers*  I watched this film at a family event with my young grandchildren.  Their parents thought these restless kiddos on a hot summer night might be diverted by a movie about magic.  But BURT ""WONDERBALLS"" is raunchy, full of adult humor, and, possibly most disturbing of all for young children, contains gory and frightening masochistic stunts by the Jim Carrey character.  Oops.  Back to HUGO for the little ones.  That film truly captures the magic of illusion, and has a protagonist kids can relate to.

WONDERSTONE is a highly predictable Hollywood product that has some funny moments, but a lot of the jokes a fall flat.  Magic stunts pop up throughout the movie, but most look like wizardry, not magic.  They aren't believable in the way that theatrical magic must have a tantalizing plausibility to it no matter how mystifying the stunt may be.  Consider MARY POPPINS (this example may apply to Harry Potter as well, but I'm not as familiar with those films).  When Mary Poppins is on the scene, magic loses its suspense--you know she can't fail--and thus there is no ""hold your breath"" quality as to whether she can pull it off, no sigh of relief and admiration when she does, no wonder as to how the heck she did that.  Poppins' invincibility established the supernatural nature of her character and thus worked fine in the Disney film.  But WONDERSTONE's characters are most definitely mere mortals.

The script is actually not terrible as it trods the formulaic path of a cad (narcissistic idiot Burt Wonderstone, superstar magician on the Vegas Strip) whose arrogance leads to his downfall (fresh competition by a punk magician on the street prompts a disastrous attempt by Wonderstone and his partner to update their image), abandonment (partner leaves act, casino owner fires Wonderstone), and learning life lessons(abetted by hot babe and elder magician).  All ending, of course, with climactic vanquishing of competitor, romantic conquest of aforementioned hot babe, and triumphant reunion with alienated friend and partner.  Yawn.  I mean, we've seen it all a million times before, just dressed up with some magic this time.

Carell is an actor who is great at projecting withering self-doubt and insecurity, but not at conveying Wonderstone's overbearing self-confidence and hubris.  Watching him flounder in the lead only made me wonder whether a master at portraying comic self-delusion like Peter Sellers could have made this a memorable picture.  Steve Buscemi as Wonderstone's put-upon partner looks too old to have been Wonderstone's childhood buddy, and he's not much of a comedian.  Jim Carrey as Wonderstone's revolting rival is his usual manic, mildly amusing self.  James Gandolfini as the casino tycoon says his lines competently and collects his paycheck.  Alan Arkin as Wonderstone's retired muse is the true magician here, showing what wonders an acting veteran can do with mediocre material.  Olivia Wilde as the love interest looks pretty and seems to have a sense of humor about the whole thing.

While the subject of the barbs might seem to be outsized show business egos and excesses, I think the real target is modern audiences' thirst for ever more bizarre and perilous types of entertainment, exemplified by the over-the-top Vegas scene portrayed here, and even more specifically, by this very movie.  In that sense, BURT WONDERSTONE is a film that satirizes itself.  Too bad it doesn't have the guts to do so more savagely, in a DR. STRANGELOVE sort of way.  It settles for easy laughs, but is not an altogether unpleasant way to spend a couple of hours.",1373760000,,3603,5.061016949152543
5723877,2,B00CJ5BG8Y,"The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, while humorous at times, lacked the charm of other Carell movies. The characters where very one dimensional and failed to engender likability. The plot was very predictable, which would have been ok for a comedy if original and funny...this was not! Jim Carrey's character as the bully protagonist missed the mark and plunged straight into humorless idiocy. Even If you have nothing better to do this movie is a sad way to waste 100 minutes.",1373760000,,474,5.012658227848101
5723878,2,B00CJ5BG8Y,"Good films begin with good scripts, and this film's script is a mess, so there isn't much that Carell, Buscemi, and Carrey can do to make it work.  Carrey has gotten at least some positive press from his Brain Rapist street magician that spoofs another popular illusionist known for freaking the minds of his viewers, but even his parodic send-up is not worth the price of admission to the film.  It was nice seeing the late James Gandolfini in one of his last performances, but even he was wasted in the role.  Throw in Olivia Wilde being given a minor role and you have another lost opportunity.  Alan Arkin turns in a nice little performance, probably the only other nice thing about the film.

5723911,2,B00CJ5BG8Y,"I hope the other magician movie is better. This one reminded me of ""Best Defense"" from 1984. In that film the movie was screened and labeled a bomb, so the studio dumped $6 Million on Eddie Morphy to shoot a handful of scenes. Those scenes were then edited into the ""bomb"" and Eddie Murphy's name made top billing even though he was in just 6 minutes. Murphy later said it almost ruined his career.

Now Jim Carey was certainly in the movie more than 6 minutes, but the interaction between Carey and Steve Carell and Steve Buscemi is so limited at the start I wondered if he was added in as an afterthought. Even the credits state ""Starring Steve Carell, Steve Buscemi"" leaving Cary out.

It might be a good career move to be left out of this billing for Carey since his last several movies hae been less than spectacular. What happened to the ""Bruce Almighty"" Jim? It seems he is doing the Eddie Murphy career dive only without the Disney-esque personality change.

Buscemi is one of my favorite actors, but miscast as the Steve Carell side-kick. He is just not believable. I think Buscemi would have been better in the role the late Gandolfini had. Although not miscast, Gandolfini was just not ethnic enough for the way the character was written. It seemed to me the character of the casino owner was kind of bland, where it could have been amazing.

As long as I'm pooping on everyone, I should excrete equally on Steve Carell since he was equally responsible for this movie's failure. Come on STEVE! Please don't just play the same guy over and over like Jerry Lewis. You are an amazing actor, so come up with something new. If the director does not have the vision to let you be the great star you are then punch him/her in the nasty bits. Sometimes you have to just say NO to playing the same character over and over again.

The movie had its funny moments but was very predictable. The only unexpected scene was the Buscemi goes to Africa segment. But the rest we all saw coming. It does not even make sense in the continuity and timeline for much of the film.

Don't pay for this, wait until it's on free TV. It's not so bad for free. At least you'll get what you pay for.",1373328000,,2181,4.4264339152119705

5723931,4,B00CJ5BG8Y,"This isn't a great movie.  Heck, it may not even be a good one.

It's surely derivative, and even though Jim Carrey has his standard moments of brilliance, I kept thinking that I've seen it all before.  There was a scene that reminded me of ""The Jerk""; I can't remember what that scene was even 12 hours after watching.  And there is a ripoff of the old Ricky Bobby line:  ""With all due respect. . . "" and then the subsequent insult, which is all OK of course because of the ""respect"" part that came before it.

But as you should know -- and as the critics know but ignore anyways -- these types of movies aren't created to stimulate your brain.  In any way.  But they are made to stimulate your funny bone, and it surely does that here and there.

It was strange to see James Gandolfini here, so soon after he died.  Some people may say, ""Oh, it's too soon!  Is it OK to watch this film anyways?""  Of course it is; this is America, after all, and we are free to do whatever we want.  And we are free to watch Steve Buschemi get openly ridiculed for being, err, not a pretty boy, to put it nicely, and I really liked the fact that Mr. Buschemi seems to just take it in stride.  While he certainly doesn't have the prettiest skin, he does have some seriously thick skin.  And watching him juxtaposed against Olivia Wilde is certainly wild; perhaps they should have called this film ""Beauty and the Beast"" instead?

While Mr. Carrey is certainly excellent here, the saving grace is, as usual, Alan Arkin.  He absolutely killed me in ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" and he kept up that tradition here.  I always get an immediate smile on my face when I see that he's in a film, and I surely hope that he continues to keep working as long as is possible.

If you want a great movie, go watch ""Schindler's List.""  But if you want to get a few laughs, watch ""Burt Wonderstone.""  Both movies have value, even if you might remember one years after watching while forget most of the other after only 12 hours.",1373241600,,1992,4.315363881401617

That leaves the ending of the movie a little disappointing, though also hilariously funny once it hits the credits.  I won't ruin the story for you, though.

The humor in this movie is just awesome.  You will laugh or at least see reason to laugh... or you will be a robot with no sense of humor.  The movie is hilarious.  It offers you many big comedy stars along with some drama stars to try to produce a laughably bad story about two magicians from childhood to adulthood... but nothing inbetween.

The Jim Carey character was a clever idea, but over played to the point of being annoying.

Alan Arkin saves Burt, and saves the movie. Even after being a fan of his for 40 years, he always brings something original and positive to every movie he is in. The way he explains the awe of magic really connects with the audience, and his scene at the end was quite well done.

Decent.  You might even find yourself wondering if real stage performers go through this type of melancholic career dip.  You will recognize the reality TV element as embodied by Jim Carrey... and towards the end, you might find yourself agreeing with Carrell and Arkin in asking ""Is this what qualifies as magic, today?""

But as simple, fun entertainment it was a pretty good movie. The story of two young boys growing up as ""magical friends"" and making it big as magicians was kind of funny. It was predictable and kind of cheesy in parts, but if you're looking for some simple, brainless entertainment then this movie is just the ticket.

And like the original reviewer I read, it is fairly clean. Maybe that's why so many reviewers are bashing it. I think everyone is used to crude, over-the-top, nasty humor now-a-days.

It's a very goofy, at times rude and crude, silly film, but with a surprising heart at its core, particularly when it involves Alan Arkin's character.  I loved the way his character is used in the finale, and it's one of the most memorable moments for me this year at the movies.  Add to that I was laughing so hard at the ending credits' depiction of what happens to the magician duo's big illusion set piece as time goes on that my friend turned to me and said ""It's funny, but it's not THAT funny"" because I was lost in laughing so hard I was practically losing my breath.  As I've noticed many times in life, comedy is personal, and this one happened to be fascinating and entertaining to me on several levels.  I love variety acts, and magicians in particular.  I have a soft spot for sweet depictions of the elderly being treated with respect and valued as human beings as they fade away in assisted living homes and nursing homes.  I had never seen Olivia Wilde before and thought her wonderful in this.  Steve Carell, Steve Buscemi, Jim Carrey, Alan Arkin and James Gandolfini (RIP) have a ball in this and it shows--and I caught the wave with them, laughing through most of the film.  This film managed to engage me from beginning to end, in both comic and touching ways, and I appreciated that.  One of my favorite films of the year.",1372118400,38,1503,4.393501805054152
5724031,5,B00CJ5BG8Y,"Rance Holloway was my childhood hero... OK. Almost anyone named Holloway - personal bias. The story here is not saccharine-free, but also not overly syrupy. But then again, it is really hard to get too misty-eyed over Steve Buscemi. Terrific character actor but, well... ;^j The story arch, from Childhood friends allied against the bullies and jerks that populate many of our own school days, coming full circle through the down and outs and crossing paths with a mentor to reunite for the big finish, is also not overly original but the movie was great and had enough flash to satisfy. From Jim Carry's amalgamation of street ""magicians"" to Alan Arkins acerbic, out-to-pasture master of his craft, and everyone in-between, the magic was more than illusion. All of these actors were at the top of their games. Olivia Wilde as Nicole/Jane is as beautiful as always and here we get to see the balance she can bring to a performance. Poised and self-aware and completely sure of her ability, she brought all of that to the role of Jane who out of love of the craft endured the base roles expected of women in the magical world of stage magic. The parallels are so obvious it is no wonder she was made for the part. It is my own problem that I had to mention her beauty here first but one with which she is not unfamiliar. Read the bit of trivia about her on IMDB to get the deeper humor of the blond wig.

Steve Carrel in the title role portrayed the jaded pomposity of a Vegas headliner to the hilt. Stardom is an escape-act they say and who knows what other Steven (from Daily Shows Past) could stand to hear that more than their own name chanted at him, every night, 4 days a week, three weeks a month. As with most magic shows, suspension of disbelief is a key element of the audience's enjoyment with ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"". I've had a time or two when Mr. Carrel's goofy-takes have reduced my ability to appreciate his talent, as in the other Carry - Carrel (reversed here) vehicle Bruce Almighty and then the ill-fated Evan. Not the case here, and since The 40-Year Old Virgin and Get Smart, Date Night and Seeking a Friend for the End of The World, his movies have really played his wry demeanor off his sincerity. And once you can fake sincerity, you've got it made. That was kind of what Burt couldn't do at all. And his Mentor Rance had to remind him of the magical joy he had lost, in his life, his relationships, and his act.

I give ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" 5 stars not for the same reasons I gave top ratings to Life of Pi but because like that visually stunning film, this movie left me with a feeling of surety about my life and the people I have chosen to share it with or just fallen in with for the long haul.  That, and I laughed myself off the sofa. The side-show aspect of life in general always makes me smile. The spotlight thrown by these stars on the lesser celestials they parody draws a contrast which shines into the dark places we are not supposed to see, where the magic happens, behind the scenes.",1372118400,2,3048,4.458781362007168

It's a light, predictable comedy with a few good laughs and a wealth of filler material. Although Steve Buscemi and Jim Carrey appear in supporting roles, the spotlight is largely reserved for Steve Carell, who's merely okay as an out-of-touch, egomaniacal Las Vegas magician. Carrey is particularly wasted in his role, a Criss Angel-David Blaine hybrid that amounts to little more than a barbed punchline, and doesn't even receive the dignity of an endgame. The film is at its most entertaining when Carell is insufferable, a snobby celebrity lost in his own self-image, but quickly loses steam when Carrey's grim not-quite-magic act forces him to wake up. The plot becomes fairly paint-by-numbers from there, with a tour of skid row and a telegraphed love interest (Olivia Wilde) lining Wonderstone's path to redemption, and navigates no sharp turns on its way to an empty happy ending.

5724046,3,B00CJ5BG8Y,"I had heard mixed reviews about The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, so I decided to forget about the reviews and find out for myself. And I'm glad I did. It's not the best Steve Carrel/Jim Carrey movie, however it had its moments... some great laugh out loud moments.

Burt Wonderstone (Steve Carrell) and Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi) lived the charmed life: money, women, and their own headlining act on the Vegas Strip. But after years of performing the same stale routine over and over, their lives were thrown into a tailspin when street magician, Steve Gray (Jim Carrey), came into the picture. Now, everything they've ever known and loved have been taken from them--including their own friendship.

In order to begin that slow rise back to the top, and regain what they've lost, they have they have to try and compete with this newer form of 'street magic'. And that's where some of the funny happens. Personally, I think Jim Carrey has lost his touch. (Who can forget the horrible, 'Fun With Dick and Jane' and 'Yes Man'?) However, I must admit, I did enjoy Carrey's performance as a Chris Angel wannabe. Very funny! And Steve Carrell? Well... he's Steve Carrell! Again, this isn't his best performance, but all-in-all, it was rather enjoyable.

And let's not forget the amazing Alan Arkin as Rance Holloway, aging magician/legend.  Love him!

Again, 'The Incredible Burt Wonderstone' isn't the 'best' Steve Carrell / Jim Carrey movie, but it definitely has its moments. And for the most part, I enjoyed myself.

BTW... Steve Gray's 'end performance', (Jim Carrey), had me laughing out loud! :D",1370995200,4,1601,4.955223880597015
5724047,3,B00CJ5BG8Y,"When I entered the theater to view The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, I thought I knew exactly what I was getting into. The film was advertised as a comedy. With stars Steve Carell and Jim Carrey, this film seemed to seem in the same style as the stars' other collaboration, Bruce Almighty.

The movie begins promising enough. We learn of Burt's (Carell) difficult childhood. A typical nerd, loner type who found himself bullied by all but one kid, Anton (played by Steve Buscemi), Burt finds refuge in a magic kit. This passion leads the two, Burt and Anton, to eventually become partners in a magic act. Soon they are headlining a show in Las Vegas, and they seem to be on top of the world.

Fast forward ten years, and the two are still performing the same act at the same hotel. The show has not aged well. The first time we see the two perform the show, comedy is found not in the wackiness of the production but just by the observation of how stupid and outdated it is. Underneath the bright lights of showbiz, larger problems arise. Burt and Anton resent each other and can't even make it between set pieces without arguing. Burt has become a womanizing egomaniac who thinks the entire act revolves around him. With their relationship in turmoil and ticket sales falling, the two are urged by the hotel owner (James Gandolfini) to ""freshen up"" their act.

Their assistant, Jane (Olivia Wilde) attempts to help them with the new act. But Burt's ego won't allow it. Soon, Anton leaves the act and the hotel discontinues the show. Burt finds himself out of work and with no one to turn to. It seems that magic has been replaced by the grotesque stunts as performed by Steve Gray ( Jim Carrey), kind of a cross between Chris Angel and David Blaine.

On a whim, Burt ends up performing at the nursing home that houses his own magician idol, played by Alan Arkin of Little Miss Sunshine and more recently Argo. With his help, Burt sets out to rekindle his love of magic and to rebuild his life.

As always, Jim Carrey is perfect at capturing the crazy and absurd character. He is really a scene stealer in this film. Unfortunately, I'm not convinced that this movie really needed that kind of character. It sets out to be this off the wall comedy in the style of Will Ferrell, but Steve Carell is a completely different kind of actor. His dry, often quiet delivery just doesn't work here. There are few moments in the movie that caused me to laugh out loud, and with the way the film played at the box office, I fear that is the case for most viewers. This movie may have worked as a smaller, somewhat quirky tale of a man's path to self discovery. Instead, we are given a predictable, unfunny movie that fails to realize what it truly is.",1370736000,3,2738,4.48995983935743

The director, Don Scardino, is mostly famous for directing TV series like 30 Rock, Law & Order, and Cosby, and it is kind of apparent in the movie. Nevertheless, this movie is still watchable and at times funny, and you get to see some guest star magicians like David Copperfield. However, if it was not because of Jim Carrey and Alan Arkin, I would give it 3 stars or less, but these guys really saved the movie. I also hope Olivia Wilde--which I know her mostly for her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-M-D-s/dp/B001A4VH2U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House, M.D.'s</a>&nbsp;""13"" role--to be able to get away from hottie roles before it is too late.

5724049,3,B00CJ5BG8Y,"The plot - a pair of magician partners and long-time friends watch their lives and Vegas performance fall apart as one becomes a misogynistic prima donna and the act grows stale as the public loses interest to more shocking magic performances. With Steve Carrell, Steve Buscemi, Jim Carrey and Alan Arkin in the line up, what can go wrong with this idea?

Well quite a lot, as it turns out since they all get upstaged by James Gandolfini as the casino manager and Alan Arkin as the aging mentor, and the film lingers on the wrong scenes too long while missing the opportunities afforded by the premise. Carrey is funny as an extreme Kris Angel caricature though the implausibility of some of his masochistic routines starts to wear thin. Carrell's character is just plain unlikable and watching his non-stop berating of everyone around him goes on far too long for the audience to really connect with him by the time he has to change. Buscemi has great comic timing but is fundamentally underused.

There are some laughs throughout but the jokes aren't nearly as good as you would expect with such a strong cast playing cheesy 1980s magicians in Vegas. The biggest flaw is that the plot is one of the most predictable I've seen in years - by the midpoint, I turned to my wife and predicted every major event through to the end. The forced love interest with Olivia Wilde is a weak afterthought and the finale is so absurd that even for a comedy it really doesn't work with the tone of the film.

Overall, this is fine as a cheap rental (or hopefully a release on Prime) but really misfires. Some of the jokes are labored repeatedly and though its far from awful, such a weak script has no chance of extracting the best from its cast.",1368230400,4,1733,4.565916398713826

Very few comedies come at you at a thousand mile an hour all the way through - Dumb and Dumber being one exception (watch out for D and D 2 - on the way), but Burt loses momentum to an unacceptable degree and it really made the movie drag at times.

5724058,3,B00CJ5BG8Y,"It is amazing to me that this concept has yet to be explored by Hollywood. I guess it is inevitable that it eventually happened. A few years back a magician named David Blaine came onto the scene doing street magic that changed the way everybody looked at the business. The traditional magic show lost its luster a little bit. People like David Copperfield and acts like Siegfried & Roy became a stale and overdone display. When Blaine sort of stepped out of the limelight, a magician named Criss Angel took over and took street magic to a whole new level. ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is an obvious poke at Criss Angel and a imalgorithm of Copperfield, Siegfried & Roy.

Criss Angel's television show is called ""Mind Freak"". Jim Carrey plays a character named Steve Gray, who's television show is called ""Brain Rape"". So, as you can see, there is no hiding who the target of the movies jokes are for. Gray is a guy who is doing crazy tricks like driving nails into tables with his head or pulling cards out of his bloody cheek. So when Gray starts gaining popularity and Wonderstone's (Steve Carell) ticket sales begin to drop, as you can guess, Burt and his partner Anton's (Steve Buscemi) ride at the top of the magic world comes crashing down.

Alan Arkin, James Gandolfini and Olivia Wilde round out a nice cast of characters who put on a good show. Surprisingly though, with comedians like Jim Carrey and Steve Carell, I didn't find ""Wonderstone"" all that funny. Yet, there are a few moments that I was glad that I was the only one in the movie theatre on a beautiful Friday afternoon because I laughed harder than I had in a long time. ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is mildly funny for the most part but that doesn't stop it from having an interesting concept that is always interesting to watch. I mean, who doesn't like a good magic show.

The creators could have taken this incredible concept movie to a better level in my opinion, but to their credit, they never cheapened their film with gimmick jokes or crudeness. As I said in the beginning though, the comedic angle on magicians in Las Vegas is a fresh one. I just wish that the comedy had been more effective throughout the film, instead of just at certain times. It was fun to take a trip to Vegas for a bit though, and it was fun to take a different look at a always interesting and mysterious business.",1364774400,3,2380,4.55607476635514
5724059,2,B00CJ5BG8Y,"If you want to see how a perfectly awful movie can be produced with talented actors and a big enough budget to do wowza special effects tricks, see The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, a movie so bad it probably sets the mark for this year's Rotten Tomato awards.

We saw it because of its cast. Steve Carell is a sometimes effective comic actor who, at his best, conveys an appealing mixture of nebbishness and melancholy -you wind up rooting for him even through miscue and miscue. And he's mildly effective as caricature -see, for instance, Dinner for Schmucks, not a great movie but Carell's part works. Plus, we like Carell. Steve Buscemi is another actor rather than comedian who usually brings a great deal to his roles. Fargo was his best but he's turned in solid performances in any number of movies. At his best, Jim Carey is a brilliant comic actor.  He isn't always good, sometimes he's just excessive, but he's absolutely fearless as an actor. At his best, he does the kind of comedy that made Andy Kaufman brilliant. (Carey played Kaufman in 1999's Man on the Moon.)  He's a better mugger than Kaufman but maybe because of that, not quite as far out, but he radiates energy all over when he's on screen. And Alan Arkin! What can I say? A genius and great comic.  As far as its cast goes, this movie should have sizzled.

But it doesn't. The movie is overblown, over-sentimental, and, worst of all, soggy. Everything's signaled way too obviously. It blows its opportunities for being either real satire or a real love story. (The love sequence is trite. It climaxes -bad choice of words, probably- in a scene in bed with a young woman magician, played by Olivia Wilde, in which both magicians, through sleight of hand, produce condoms. I didn't find the scene funny and it certainly wasn't romantic.)
Carell plays Burt Wonderstone, who with his childhood friend, Anton Marvelton (played by Buscemi) has been doing magic since childhood. Burt and Anton have now been headliners in Vegas for over ten years. Their performance is tired, no life in it any more, and their audience is drifting away, lured by more exciting performers. Old is bad, New is good. Along comes Steve Gray (Carey), a charismatic street performer who hosts a weekly television show where he does such revolting stunts as holding in his urine for weeks on end and sleeping on a bed of hot coals. His climactic stunt comes in a showoff contest with Burt where he drills a hole in his head with a power drill.  It's not funny, and it's cruel.

That's one of the problems with this movie. Where the movie isn't hackneyed, it's usually off base in its sense of humor. Too much Potty Humor -and too many scenes where the laughs are supposed to be provoked by watching someone be abused.  It's mean spirited.

There are some good scenes in this movie, just not many of them. There are some scenes between Burt and his childhood inspiration, Rance Holloway (played by Arkin). Holloway is old now, long since retired, but Burt draws him out again. There is a lovely scene -all too soon over- where Burt and Rance try out their fledgling magic act on the old folks at Rance's retirement home, and the start of a scene where Burt puts on his act for a children's birthday party -but this second scene quickly turns nasty when Gray/Carey intrudes, and it's downhill from then on.

It looks like a lot of money was spent on special effects in this movie. Why is it, then, that the most magical moments are two when ordinary magic tricks are performed, depending not on camera wizardry or digital re-imaging but on the magician's legerdemain?

This could have been a really wonderful movie but it certainly didn't come out one.",1363910400,3,3693,4.666153846153846

5724061,2,B00CJ5BG8Y,"I should say up front that I was really prepared to like The Incredible Burt Wonderstone.  The cast line-up - Steve Carell, Steve Buscemi, Jim Carrey, Olivia Wilde, Alan Arkin and James Gandolfini - was top-notch.  The premise - a comedy about stage magicians who've worked so long together that they can barely stand each other being faced with a new and upcoming rival - held a lot of potential.  But the actual film turned out to be quite a disappointment.  It does have its moments where a breath of life seems to stir, but on the whole there are so many problems with it that it's hard to even know where to begin.  It's not a _bad_ film, exactly. It's watchable, even if you can count the number of unpredictable moments in the film on one hand without using all your fingers. But given the talent involved, it could've been so much more.

The story begins with two boys - Albert and Anthony (engagingly played by Mason Cook and Luke Vanek) - who meet up as kids and bond over a fascination with stage magic. Fast forward over the years showing them becoming Burt (Carell) and Anton (Buscemi), partners as professional stage magicians to the current day, where they've been headlining at a major Las Vegas casino run by Doug Munny (James Gandolfini) for the last ten years. Part of their shtick is their alleged ""magical friendship"" that they share, but the reality is that their act has gotten really stale and the two of them can barely stand each other. Not hard to understand really, particularly since while Anton has remained a pretty nice guy, Burt has evolved into an obnoxious egomaniac - with an obsession about having ""the biggest bed in Las Vegas"" - who treats everyone around him like crap. Including their much put-upon stage assistant Jane (Olivia Wilde) whom he keeps calling ""Nicole"" because he goes through so many assistants he can't be bothered to remember any new names.

But the trouble between Burt and Anton - and with their stale act - is suddenly exacerbated by the appearance of the new magician on the block, Steve Gray (a jaw-droppingly over-the-top Jim Carrey), who is starting to steal the limelight with his wince-and-flinch-inducing shock-and-awe form of street magic. So much so that Doug is thinking of replacing Burt and Anton with Gray when he opens the new casino he's having built.  Will Burt and Anton be able to resolve their differences and meet this threat?  Of course.  Is there ever even the slightest doubt that this will happen?  No, because you've seen this clichd formula a hundred times already.  Will you even care?  Maybe, but only after Alan Arkin finally appears to inject some actual feeling into the story.

A big part of the problem with The Incredible Burt Wonderstone seems to stem from the fact that the screenplay and story got worked and reworked so much (seven different writers in total, over a span of five years) that the result was something so formulaic that it wouldn't surprise a seven-year-old. And another part of the problem was that the original director quit after only two months, to be replaced by Jim Scardino, who although he had a lengthy record of directing TV shows had never directed a feature film before.  And who apparently has no sense of real comedy whatsoever. It's often been said that in comedy, timing is everything, and here the timing always seems to be off.  You know from what's happening that you're supposed to laugh, but the feeling just isn't there.  In addition, the film keeps throwing up lame jokes and then keeps _repeating_ them, as if in the desperate hope that maybe the third or fourth time you get hit with them you might laugh.

Another problem with the film is that you never buy into the premise that Burt and Anton are headliners at a major Las Vegas casino for the last ten years.  Their act is so cheesy that they couldn't be headliners in Hoboken for ten days. In magic, to make it work, you've got to get the audience to believe, and the same applies in film.

But the biggest part of the problem is that Steve Carell and Steve Buscemi are badly miscast here. The film could've worked if they'd cast Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly as Burt and Anton. Think Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgandy, or especially Talladega Nights: The Legend of Ricky Bobby, and it's immediately obvious how much more they could've done with this film. Ferrell has the ego-driven git down so seamlessly that he could patent the role, just as Reilly does the loyal and much put-upon sidekick role. But when Carell does Anton, you're always awkwardly aware that he's _acting_ to play Anton; it never comes across as natural. The problem is even worse for Buscemi because the script never allows him to do what he's really good at: making dryly acerbic observations on the things the other characters say and do. Just as with Carell's Burt, you never buy into Buscemi's Anton. Superbly talented as both men are, they were simply wrong for these roles.

An additional problem is that most of the other actors - particularly Olivia Wilde and James Gandolfini - are largely wasted here.  The only two actors who seem to breath any life into the film are Alan Arkin as the veteran old-school stage magician Rance Holloway and Jim Carrey's that's-gotta-hurt magician/performance-artist/masochistic-maniac Steve Gray. Arkin, even at seventy-nine still one of the best actors in the business, once again delivers a convincing - and scene-stealing - performance as Holloway. The best scenes in the film are when Carell's down-and-out Burt meets up with Arkin's Holloway in the retirement home where the desperate-for-any-work Burt has taken a job and where Holloway, the magician who inspired him as a boy to learn stage magic, now lives. Carell drops the whole jerk-version of Burt and becomes much more likeable. And more importantly, believable. After the tedium that makes up the first half of the movie, the retirement home scenes where Holloway rekindles Burt's sense of wonder and joy of performing are a welcome breath of fresh air and one of the only times where I found myself actually enjoying the movie.

Barely recommended, mainly for the scenes with Alan Arkin's old-school magic and for Jim Carrey's over the top flinch-and-wince inducing ones.",1363737600,3,6251,4.7890334572490705
5724062,4,B00CJ5BG8Y,"Magicians and illusionists have been entertaining people for a very long time and the magicians life can make for some fascinating film (e.g. THE PRESTIGE) and television (e.g. ""The Amazing Falsworth"" and ""Mr. Magic"" episodes of AMAZING STORIES). However, there aren't very many comedies made about magicians. In fact, the only thing that comes to mind is Gob Bluth on ARRESTED DEVLEOPMENT. Therefore, when I first heard about Steve Carell's movie, THE INCREDIBLE BURT WONDERSTONE, I was intrigued by the concept and eager to see how the film would be.

Carell plays title character, Burt Wonderstone, the front man of a magician act in Las Vegas that he stars in with his best friend, Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi). Burt and Anton have been best friends since they were kids and have been doing the same act to sold out crowds for a decade. However, when a new street ""magician"" named Steve Gray (Jim Carrey) appears on the scene, Wonderstone and Marvelton's audiences start to dwindle. After a botched attempt at a street spectacle of their own, the duo break up and go their separate ways and Wonderstone has to do a lot of soul searching and rediscovery before he's ready to attempt a triumph return to the limelight.

I really enjoyed THE INCREDIBLE BURT WONDERSTONE. It's not a great movie, but it is a good movie that has a lot of heart. It's a redemption story full of zany, comical moments. The film made me laugh out loud several times. Initially, the movie garnered a lot of negative reviews after its theatrical release. I'm not sure why except that ever since THE OFFICE, critics seem to expect too much from Steve Carell. He's a great actor and a very funny man, but every production he's in isn't going to be another THE OFFICE and every character he plays can't be Michael Scott. The critics need to lighten up a little and enjoy Carell's character and the movie for what they are and not for what they are not.

Besides Carell, Buscemi turns in a nice performance. Buscemi is actually a great actor that has made a solid career, despite having less than stellar looks. Still, as an actor he doesn't always get the credit or roles he deserves. Although he takes second billing to Carell, it's nice to see him playing a role with larger recognition. Jim Carrey does a good job as the antagonist of the movie. Carrey doesn't make many movies anymore, so it's nice to see him when he does pop up. Alan Arkin seems to be everywhere recently and does a nice job in the supporting role of Wonderstone's inspiration. Olivia Wilde is beautiful as always, but her character is one that's actually completely unnecessary for the story.

Overall, THE INCREDIBLE BURT WONDERSTONE is an entertaining and humorous world at the look of a magician's life. It's not the type of comedy than many might expect from Steve Carell. Instead, it's more of a classical comedy with a touch of zany edginess and a whole lot of heart. It's might not be a great movie (or one of Carell's best movies), but it is a good movie, nonetheless.",1363737600,8,3027,4.684210526315789
