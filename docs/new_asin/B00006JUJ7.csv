1783118,3,B00006JUJ7,"I know everyone hates bad reviews and especially a bad one over something as great as John Denvers music, but I do feel a need to make a few comments about this DVD. I bought all three of them BTW as I had to purchase all three to get my favorite songs. First off, if you love acoustic guitar playing and John Denvers music by all means buy this DVD as I did and I don't think you will regret it too much. You will learn to play the songs, though it could have been made a much easier.

Considering the price of this DVD more should be expected of it especially considering the technology nowdays and the quality of the competition in other Learn to play type DVDS.

 First I will mention the good things about this DVD. To the producers merit, it has a nice tablature book included with it, showing ""Most"" of the chords and all the fingering for the songs, although it lacks lyrics to every single song (Which can be looked up online at many lyric sites). The instructer Pete Huttlinger did play with John Denver and obviously knows the songs and the ins and outs of it all, and it is awesome to see exactly how John Denver played each song as compared to tab or chord books which can be bought that don't always show every exact thing. There is a split screen showing both right and left hands to help viewers out, although the left hand fingering isn't shown up close enough and when he's doing some chords you have to refer to the tab book to actually see what he's doing. Pete dominates playing of Johns songs on the guitar no doubt. The sound is also really good and listening to what he does play of each song is a great experience. I would say for all these above features this DVD IS worth buying.

Now for the bad things.

 This DVD appears to be just a transfer to DVD format of VHS. It has absolutely no DVD features like looping and someone correct me if i'm wrong as I don't have a DVD player in my computer now, but it doesnt mention anywhere that the TABS are included on the DVD so that the viewer can print them out in a more user friendly fashion. The included tabs, in a small booklet hold very few verses per page and it's impossible to be page flipping while playing the guitar and none of the tab is ever shown on the screen while Pete is playing the songs, thus making learning them much more difficult. I am literally going to have to type all the tab up myself and print them out in pages that hold more verses per page, and mind you include the lyrics for every song I wish to learn so I can play and sing.

The material here should be considered advanced guitar playing, though nothing is too difficult that with practice it can't be mastered. I really didn't have problems playing the songs at all, but then again I've played the guitar for 20 years. Beginners will have to master chords and picking before being able to really play these songs. Contrary to some comments I don't feel Pete is that great of a teacher. Great guitarist yes, teacher emphatically no. Not sure why another reviewer said he was (Maybe he works for the producers of the video) he runs through all the songs way way too fast, (though of course you can easily rewind with DVD) but it's just that some of the parts are so extremely difficult and as Pete can dominate the guitar so well he runs through it and left me with my jaw hanging wondering what he had done on several occasions. He will explain it very quickly sometimes but I think he just needed to slow down and really demonstrate what was being done if in fact he really intended to teach it to us. He basically assumes way to much from guitar players.. as if we were all at his proficiency of playing. I know if I was, then I sure wouldn't have bought the DVD to begin with. He also Assumes everyone knows every song well and just says buy a CD of it so you will know how it should go. Excuse me but that's the reason I bought the DVD.. to learn them. He doesnt play some of the songs in their entirety and just goes over major parts. Those he does show he is quickly finished with as if he is in a hurry to get them over with and start on his next DVD.

I had problems with this DVD from the get go on the first song, when I discovered the chord diagram in the tablature for the DMAJ7 in the 5th position is missing. Another minor gripe was when I saw him use the D and Dsus4 on the 5th fret in the intro to ""Annies Song"", when i've seen John on a live DVD concert play it in the first position and although John uses a 12 string, and maybe it does sound better on the 5th fret, it's not how John played it and it makes it much harder to play the intro to the song.

 All in all though I would recommend this DVD to Advanced players wishing to learn exactly how John played his songs as I have no doubt that each song CAN be learned, though the producers have made it more difficult then it should be. I literally spent 4 hard sessions learning ""My Sweet Lady"", however after alot of hard work, I can now play it. I do think for the price of this DVD Pete could have spent way more time with each song and DVD features could have been incorporated.

 I'm giving it a 3 as others have given it a 5 and there's just no way with the previously mentioned flaws it deserves a 5 and though I am learning the songs so the DVDS not a total waste, it is very expensive to buy all three of them and they definitely could have made the process easier for us.",1124841600,49,5413,4.159503342884432
1783119,5,B00006JUJ7,"If you are at all interested in playing John Denver's music, this is a great way to get started.  I have both the first and second tapes and my only complaint is that there is not a third.",1086912000,,188,3.9473684210526314
1783120,5,B00006JUJ7,"I enjoy playing the guitar and singing along, poorly I might add.  Generally, I can only play the guitar chords.  This DVD does a great job of unlocking the secret behind what the artist is doing.  Not only does he do an exceptional job of giving behind the scenes information on what made John Denver so good, but also his mannerisms and ability to explain the songs made it easy to play songs that many of us would find difficult to do on our own.  Many of these type instructional videos play the song and then play it slowly and move on.  He repetitively went through the songs so you could really pick it up.  Obviously, that's a credit to excellent camera work and direction.  When you're as bad a player as I am, it's really helpful to have a video like this one that gives such great insight.",1075161600,12,800,4.328859060402684
1783121,4,B00006JUJ7,"John Huttlinger does a overall good job of explaining
the ins and outs of John Denver's  music. It is wirthy of having.  If you grew up listening to John Denver's music and like to play guitar like me, you'll understand what I'm saying.  Which brings me to his really cool( and never played anywere)  tune  ""Late Winter Early Spring""  Since this is the reason I bought the DVD in the first place He only goes through half the song.  It is really a duet and he didn't even touch the leadsection.  To say the least I was really Disappointed.",1058832000,15,539,4.373737373737374
1783122,5,B00006JUJ7,Peter is a good and entertaining teacher.  Each song builds off the other in terms of difficulty.  I don't have much natural talent.  With practice I found them easy to learn and play.,1414540800,,184,4.515151515151516
1783123,5,B00006JUJ7,"These DVD's are a definite help in learning John Denver's music. I was having a hard time finding the sheet music for a lot of John Denver's songs that weren't his best hits collection. All I could find were the same hits over and over. This DVD collection provides not only good instruction, but a large volume of of his lesser known music from his albums. I do not think this is for beginners, but if you have some basic knowledge of the guitar, can work their way through it. Pete's instruction is not hard to follow. Just pause lesson to digest at your own speed.",1400198400,,567,4.3584905660377355
1783124,4,B00006JUJ7,"I am an intermediate guitar player,not great but work hard. I bought this to learn time in a bottle so I can only comment on that song. The written transcriptions were helpful and both guitar parts are written out. The written transcriptions would benefit from having some fingerings notated, since the correct fingerings make or break being able to play the song at speed. Fr the video, I found it most helpful to work out the fingerings, and Mr. Huttlinger could have made this easier by discussing it more, and the rationale behind the fingerings. I would have also appreciated him playing the entire song through at 1/2 or 3/4 speed to make it easy to practice along with him. My biggest challenge in the song is trying to get over the first shift in the intro, even with following where he puts his fingers, I get too much string noise or buzzing. Per helps some coaching on what must be a common problem would have helped, or perhaps some alternative suggestions.",1391644800,,969,4.6395348837209305
1783125,5,B00006JUJ7,Great instruction and explanation on how to play the songs. The stories about John Denver only make the DVDs even more special.,1376524800,,127,4.818181818181818
1783126,5,B00006JUJ7,"I really highly recommend this DVD. The teacher is an immensely good-natured-seeming, bright guy who does a really good, step-by-step go-through of the songs, note by note. I learned several of the songs already and I am not an amazing guitarist by any stretch. Simply taught but the songs themselves don't sound simple or rote.",1356912000,,328,4.9818181818181815
1783127,5,B00006JUJ7,"Probably one of the greatest finger style guitarist around....easy going, thorough, measure by measure explanations... laced with a little bit of a dry wit which always makes it entertaining. Spend some time with any product he puts out and see a measurable improvement in your technique and musical knowledge.",1347840000,,310,5.346938775510204
1783128,5,B00006JUJ7,"I have played guitar for years, but not always at a very high level.  I'm probably an intermediate player or a little higher now.  My last big jump in ability I attribute to Pete Huttlinger's teaching.  I had done some finger picking before, but it was all pattern; very little deviation from a pattern, and this I had learned from a John Denver songbook that showed the pattern for each song.  With Huttlinger's DVDs, I have been able to make the jump to playing at a much higher level.  I own the John Denver level 1; both Croce DVDs, and the Gordon Lightfoot one.  Pete takes you through step-by-step and always brings you back to the part of the song he's teaching to tie in the material, and this is something that other teachers don't alwasy do very well.  I've bought several DVDs from other instructors and Pete's teaching is unmatched.  Very easy to learn from, as he is an excellent teacher.  Good to have some experience with rudimentary finger-picking with this DVD, but it's not that hard to get that.  Playing Croce's material at the level that Pete teaches it is very gratifying.  Can't recommend this highly enough.  Buy it and enjoy getting to that next level.  Thanks for some great DVDs, Pete!",1332633600,,1212,4.607476635514018
1783129,5,B00006JUJ7,I have always loved the music of Jim Croce. I am at best an intermmediate level guitarist and found this dvd to help tremendously.  Every effort is made to give a patient and expanded view of how to play each song. Pete Huttlinger is to be appretiated for the amount of time spent to guide us along. I also am grateful that both tablature and note arrangements are supplied in addition to the video lesson.,1321574400,,406,4.413333333333333
1783130,5,B00006JUJ7,"I now own two of Pete's John Denver DVD's. I think that in the time constraints of a DVD that he does a good job of showing how to play John's music the way he played it. If you are a begining player, this might not be for you. You might be better off getting an easy arangment book instead. There are a lot of assumtions here, like that you already know how to finger pick. But,,if you are up for the challange of learning some great music from a Denver insider, you will be greatly rewarded. John's guitar playing was all about flawless right hand technique. Go slow and practice often then go knock'em dead at open mic night!",1320451200,,628,4.241666666666666
1783131,5,B00006JUJ7,"I bought this DVD so I could learn the song Country Roads better and it helped a lot. It comes with a booklet and you do need it to refer to as when you watch a DVD of someone playing, even though he explains where his fingers are, for me, it helps to read it in tab as well to make sure I got it right.
Watching this DVD makes you feel like you are with a teacher and the good thing is, he did play with John Denver for a few years so you feel confident that you are learning how to play his songs correctly. If you are a beginner, I wouldn't think this is the only lesson you would need to learn to play his songs. When John plays, it doesn't sound like it is hard to play but it is. In fact, even Peter Huttlinger mentions that John's music is much like rubbing your head in one direction and your stomach in the other. It does take a lot of practice if you are not used to playing much but it is lot of fun!
I would recommend this to anyone, beginnner or advanced student because you are getting a lesson by someone who really knows his music and it is really interesting to see him play up close without all the other instruments of the band around him. It's just him and the guitar and its very pleasant to listen to.",1317427200,,1223,3.975609756097561
1783132,5,B00006JUJ7,"There are quite a few songs from John Denver's catalog that I want to learn to play.  Pete was a long time member of John's band, so knows the material he is teaching.  Pete does a great job of instructing.  He shows the parts needed to play the song and make music.  Pete does not drone on forever about ""put your 4th finger on the 3rd string on the 6th fret and then put your......etc.""  Pete also uses his understated humor and tells a story here and there about John Denver.

I enjoyed the videos, learned alot from them and play a better John Denver song now.  Thanks to Pete.",1313712000,2,581,4.2272727272727275
1783133,4,B00006JUJ7,"I have always been a huge Jim Croce fan and I have had a great time playing his songs, so I bought this DVD to learn more about playing these great tunes.  I also have Pete Huttlinger teaches Dan Fogelberg songs, which is great, and easier than this lesson because Fogelberg's style is easier to learn for a less experienced player. Pete does a nice job teaching these songs with great, easy to understand arrangements that sound just like Croce.  He teaches you Croce's fingerpicking style that can be heard throughout almost all of his songs.  That being said, your satisfaction with this DVD will depend on your playing level.  As a player who sings lead vocal and essentially strums, I found the DVD to be above my playing ability, so I would not recommend this to a beginner player or someone with limited fingerpicking, barre chord or bass run playing ability, unless you really want to challenge yourself (and it will be a major challenge with lots of practice required).  A person with greater ability in the above techniques will get more enjoyment out of this lesson and I would highly recommend it those players.  Still, I won't blame the DVD for my limited skills and I still recommend it to a Croce fan looking to figure out how he made all those great, distinctive sounds on his records.",1284940800,,1301,4.6347826086956525
1783134,5,B00006JUJ7,"I have been playing guitar for more years than most people have been alive but never was able to capture what recording artists were doing with their guitars until I purchased this dvd.

Not only have I been able to learn the music of Jim Croce but thru Pete's lessons, the picking patterns I have learned are easily transferable to other songs from other artists I like.

I now play this music on an acoustic steel string and a classical guitar with equal but different effect.

I have just purchased another of Pete's dvds (Gordon Lightfood) and can't wait to master the Canadian's style.",1267574400,,590,4.653846153846154
1783135,5,B00006JUJ7,"A great way to learn the guitar songs of John Denver.  I don't know the notes or how to read music, but Pete Hutlinger on these CDs helped me learn these songs.  In a few short sessions, you will be playing these very recognizable licks and choruses.  I would rate myself as a beginner to intermediate, and I'm confident that I can learn any song on these CDs the way Pete teaches them.  You can too.",1266364800,,400,4.223684210526316
1783136,5,B00006JUJ7,"This DVD has a collection of the more popular and beautiful songs of Jim Croce.
Pete does a great job teaching the viewer how to master some of Croce's best guitar sounds. The guitar work is challenging but you know that if you follow the tutorial and give it plenty of time you will be very happy with what you can acheive. These DVD's are not expensive when you realise what you can get out of them. Search for more Huttlinger DVD's you will not be sorry.",1264896000,,457,4.264367816091954
1783137,4,B00006JUJ7,"After spending many years trying to play the songs of Jim Croce with absolutely NO success, this DVD was amazing. As a young boy, I first realized I wanted to play guitar AND to play it like Jim and Maury due to Jim's albums.... so having learned the first three songs has been the fulfillment of a life-long dream. (I'm 42).

Pete accurately repoduces the sound of Jim and Maury's music, no doubt about it. His skill is absolutely fantastic. Overall, I recommend this dvd to anybody who wants to learn Jim's music pretty much verbatim. In this, the video is without equal.

If you buy this DVD and aren't too familiar with fingerpicking patterns, then I offer you this, it's what I've had to do with the chorus of ""Photographs and Memories"" (even though I've been picking for years): get the feel for it by listening, and then rewind to the part you want to learn. Pause the video and move forward frame by frame. While Pete is an AWESOME fingerpicker, his teaching is fair overall and there are times when he doesn't communicate what's going on.

I'm half way through the video and I'm learning ""I got a name"". I've been practicing daily for about a month and can now pretty much repoduce Jim's sound on ""I'll have to say I love you in a song"", ""New York's not my home"" and ""Photographs and Memories"". I'm having to do the above frame by frame DVD technique in order to learn ""I've got a name."" This part is the only drawback to the DVD.

If it helps any, I've got Pete's second video on learning to play the music of Jim Croce on it's way. Even with the annoying frame by frame issue, I'd order a third installment of ""How to play the songs of Jim Croce"" by Pete Huttlinger if he were to produce one. Nobody else really comes close to teaching how to repoduce Jim's sound, and I've been looking hard for quite some time.",1261699200,3,1823,4.384615384615385
1783138,5,B00006JUJ7,"Pete Huttlinger delivers in fine fashion again, but this time goes beyond the call of duty.  He has put together brilliant and beautiful instrumental arrangements for guitar of John Denver favorites such as I'm Sorry and Leaving On A Jet Plane.  He is truly spoiling his audience.  A must-have for guitar-playing John Denver fans.",1254960000,,330,5.074074074074074
1783139,5,B00006JUJ7,"I love Jim Croce, and Pete Huttlinger does an absolutely super job showing how to play the mostly fingerpicking style of this great artist.

Pete's manner is laid back and quite congenial.  He talks about Jim and his great accompaniest both tragically gone in 1973.  There's a reverence and love for their work by Pete, and he really seems to enjoy teaching it.  I watched without playing at first, totally fascinated.

The camera shows both hands simultaneously.  Pete demonstrates the very accurate compositions at full speed, then broken down, constantly giving you instruction on fingering and how the piece was composed.  He throws in a bit of music theory, but it's not important.  The pieces are intermediate in nature, but I would say, that if you put your mind and determination to a song as a beginner you'll learn it.  Just take your time; let your fingers toughen up and your brain loosen up.

The sheet music included with the dvd(Folded up in the case) is in tablature and traditional script.  No lyrics, but Pete will sing portions to show you how it matches with the playing.  The nice part is that you can go over it and over it as much as you like- way cheaper than private lessons!",1252540800,,1200,4.661904761904762

Novice guitarists, such as myself, will enjoy the teaching style that Pete presents, and his anecdotal comments gleaned from playing as lead guitarist with John are so very interesting to hear. Pete has a friendly and patient style and his expertise is unmatched in my opinion. JD fans will love this DVD. JD fans who play guitar will learn much.",1233792000,4,475,4.734939759036145

I have learnt an enormous amount from this DVD in just two weeks, and friends I have played music with for years have remarked on the impovement. Pete also seems like a real gentleman, he teaches with a great style.
Note that Pete plays with a thumbpick - if you haven't used one yet, now is the time, but it takes getting used to.

Included is the Tab for all the songs which he instructs, some with the second guitar part (a shame all songs aren't included with Muehleisen's part).
It would benefit you to be up to speed with barre chords, much of the instruction is based on them.  So this DVD is probably best for the intermediate to advanced guitar player although it does depend on the player.",1200009600,8,664,4.739130434782608

A lot of patterns are shown in step-by-step review.  While this DVD contais a lot of information, it is not for a beginning guitarist.  You should be comfortable with intermediate level playing.

1783148,5,B00006JUJ7,"Growing up hearing John Denver, his songs were more of a ""guilty pleasure"" because of the catch pop tunes on the radio.  What I did not know until recently was what a tremendously gifted guitarist he was, as well as a talented vocalist and song writer.

Going beyond just ""Country Roads"", Denver's music is deep, complicated, and beautiful.  Pete Huttlinger, an award winning fingerstyle guitarist,  toured with Denver before his death.  Pete is unabashadly a fan of John Denver and his love of John and the music comes through nicely on this DVD set.

Although not for the beginner, if you are an ""advanced"" beginner, you will be able to start with one or two of the simpler songs of John Denver, as Pete moves through them pretty quickly (you will be using the pause button judiciously!) you will be assisted by the enclosed guitar tab booklet.  Taken slowly so as to learn properly, these are beautiful songs, presented humbly, but with a dry sense of humor that belongs to Huttlinger.  From this DVD set, I learned how deep Denver's music ran, but it also introduced me to Huttlinger---and I went from there to purchase his other teaching DVDs (on Jim Croce, and on practicing guitar) as well as Pete's musical CDs (which ever acoustic guitar player will fall in love with...especially ""Naked Pop"" sold here at Amazon).

Homespun does a great job with clear camera angles of Pete's left and right hands, and the songs are broken down, little by little.  These are like taking very expensive personal lessons, and the DVDs will take months to learn.  I find this to be among the finest that Homespun has put out (along with the Songs of Bob Dylan by Happy Traum), and are not just fun to learn, but will make you a better guitarist as you work through them.",1177977600,5,1760,4.645161290322581

This is not that video.  The teriffic video quality allows very close up neck shots, the measures are played, described, played again and discussed thoroughly.  All notes are clearly shown, the author takes time to even discuss tidbits about Jim's style in the songs, riffs that are essential to songs, etc.  The best I've seen so far in guitar vids.  I learned ""Operator"" the hard way by struggling through 5 different versions of online tabs and you tube junk.  Buy this and you can plat these songs in a few hours.

Aspen Glow, Christmas for Cowboys, This Old Guitar, I Guess He'd Rather Be in Colorado, Mother Nature's Son, Rhymes and Reasons, and Take Me Home, Country Roads.  Pete generally gives some interesting background on the songs and walks you through the chords and strums or picking patterns.  Split screen shots show you right and left hand techniques.  You may appreciate his singing, not because he sings well but because he does not sing all that well.  If he is brave enough to sing, then you should be inspired to sing as well. ;)",1159833600,11,585,4.696078431372549

My disappointment is not directed at Mr. Huttlinger but rather at myself for believing an earlier reviewer who commented that the DVD included tablature and music. I should have paid more attention to the product description. You see, I bought DVD 2 first and it does include tablature and music, which makes learning the songs much much easier. So, the omission of tablature and music is the reason for only two stars, otherwise I would have rated it much higher. If you don't need them, this is the DVD for you.",1467158400,,556,4.626262626262626

7970835,5,B00006JUJ7,Pete Huttlinger does an excellent job in these DVDs.  I had been trying to play certain John Denver songs but couldn't get them 'just right'.  I would recommend these DVDs to anyone wanting to learn to play John Denver's music as John played them.,1461974400,,247,4.590909090909091
