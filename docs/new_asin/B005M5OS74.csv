4834109,5,B005M5OS74,It's a great product with the MST3K guys taking their show and the DVD and expanding on the special features better than they did in the beginning.  They've also improved the screen saving segment thing at the beginning and made that kind of entertaining.  Well worth the money for me.,1325030400,,285,4.68
4834110,1,B005M5OS74,Product was bought to give as Christmas gift. How embarassing to watch recipient unwrap the present; then they opened the MST 3000 box only to find that each dvd case and find no dvds whatsoever. What a ripoff.,1324684800,4,210,4.552631578947368
4834111,4,B005M5OS74,"Many of these MST3K sets feature some excellent episodes and some average fair.  This particular set includes 4 very solid, if not completely astonishing episodes.  All are very good, imho, but none are gonna replace, say, ""Final Sacrifice"" or ""Girl In Lover's Lane"" on my favorite episodes list.  Here's the breakdown:

TIME OF THE APES:  Japanese Planet of the Apes ripoff made for TV, assembled and horridly dubbed by Sandy Frank.  Enjoy Johnny saying ""I don't care!"" in the most cheerful voice imaginable.  And since it was a few TV episodes strung together, enjoy the non-existant budget (worst ape masks ever, the mouths don't move at all on most of the actors), and the constant captures and escapes.  Also, the movie ends like 4 or 5 times.  Its pretty bad.  Still, a funny episode for fans of dubbed Japanese stuff.  Its not as classic as the Gamera episodes, but its ridiculous in a similar way and the riffing is solid.  A 4 star episode if there ever was one.

MIGHTY JACK:  Mighty Jack is a spy organization.  They are fighting the evil organization known as Q.  That's really about as much as you'll understand in this film.  They jump from scene to scene without tying characters or plot points together, instead substituting action and explosions for anything resembling coherance.  This filmmaking approach would later be used in the Pirates of the Carribean sequels.  Just as in the Pirates sequels, you might be surprised by how much big action stuff is going on at once, but you'll never really care about any of it since you don't ever really know who is who and why they're doing anything they're doing.  The Episode Guide lists this as one of the worst they had done at the time, and I'd be inclined to agree.  The special effects are decent, and the budget seems good for an MST3K movie, but nothing makes sense and I had no idea what was going on at any given moment.  The riffing is solid, and it shares the feel of TIME OF THE APES and the Gamera episodes, being another Sandy Frank Japanese movie, but of the Sandy Frank eps I've seen so far, this one is probably the weakest, though still an above average episode.  Another 4 star effort.

THE VIOLENT YEARS:  An Ed Wood movie!  Well, a movie written (but not directed) by ED Wood anyways.  Don't expect Plan 9 or Bride of the Monster, this movie's scope is far more down to earth.  Its plot deals with a girl who becomes the leader of a girl gang of robbers, apparently becuase her rich parents weren't there for her.  The plot is hilarious in its execution, because her folks clearly care for her.  Her dad is kindly but mildly inattentive and her mom gives her plenty of attention but isn't insightful enough to see that her daughter's glancing around and being mildly antsy means she's a deeply troubled youth.  The scripting is everything you would hope for in an Ed Wood movie, with plenty of awkward dialogue and a hamfisted, super preachy ending.  Also worth noting is the short before the movie about electric kitchen appliances where a girl has a crush on her brothers friend, and actually says to one of her girlfriends on the phone that he makes her feel all ""squishy.""  Its good stuff, and an overall solid outing for Mike and the Bots.  Again, a 4 star episode.

THE BRUTE MAN:  Rondo Hatton plays The Creeper, as he did in several horror movies of the day.  This particular time, the big lug is creeping towards and murdering the people he knew in high school that he blames for his disfigurement due to a science experiment gone bad.  As far as the movie itself goes, its really not that bad.  The main problem is pacing.  The movie could be put in about 30 minutes, but its twice as long, so they just do everything very slowly.  Its a dark film, and a slow one, so its probably the weakest of the set.  Still, the riffing is darn solid and I found myself laughing quite a bit.  The short about chicken farming is really funny too.  Of all the disks this time out, this one has the most (and best) special features.  I especially enjoyed the 30 min documentary on Rondo Hatton, and the intro from Mary Jo Pehl was nice too.  A 4 star episode, at least to me.

So there you have it, a solid addition to your MST3K collection.  There may be stronger episodes out there, but there are also plenty of weaker ones than these.  Any fan should enjoy it.",1324684800,5,4342,4.505128205128205
4834112,5,B005M5OS74,"I did not have cable TV as a child, and Mystery Science Theater 3000 is a hilarious show I missed out on because of this. Fortunately, because of our great technology, I can catch all the episodes now. My husband introduced me to the series and I'm hooked! I've watched The Final Sacrifice, Santa Claus, and The Zombie episode, and they kept me laughing throughout. People with small children can watch them, since there's no offensive material in the shows. One caveat: Although the series is very funny, a lot of the jokes won't make a lot of sense to people younger than 30, since it's a rather generational show, like Robot Chicken.",1323388800,4,636,4.6371681415929205
4834113,5,B005M5OS74,"The latest installment from Shout Factory's MST3K Volumes has 2 very much sought after movies from the Joel era and a couple of goodies from the Mike era ..
Looking at what we have

MST3K EPISODE 306 TIME OF THE APES - In a nutshell this is a Japanese version of Planet of the Apes where a lady and two whinny kids get lost in time and wind up on a world full of Apes. It actually isn't a movie but several TV shows linked together to make it appear as a movie. This one has the famous line from Johnny ""I don't care"" which became a riff that was used quite a bit in this episode and others. This has the famous Sandy Frank song at the end as well. Great episode and the show reached some new heights from this. This also is the first of two episodes with TVs Frank and Dr. Forester have a man sized child to take care of

MST3K EPISODE 314 MIGHTY JACK - Another great episode which also happens to be another Japanese TV series strung together to make a ""movie"". Think Master Ninja and there you go. This is a sci fi , crime espionage type of ""movie"" with Mighty Jack facing the evil Q - with spies, more toy spaceship models making more bank turns than any other scifi movie that appeared on the show. Overall its a slow methodical pace but still fun to watch. And another song ""Slow the Plot Down"" This one has Joel in the opening segment wearing his old Teal/greenish jumpsuit that he wore in early Season 2 episodes.

MST3K EPISODE 610 - THE VIOLENT YEARS - An Ed Wood film ! Yes, Mike's first episode where he and the bots tackle Ed Wood - basically your typical 1950s black and white exploitation film with female gangs raping young men. We also have a short in this called ""Young Man's Fancy"" and another song in this set ""Living in Deep 13"" by TVs Frank and Dr. Forester ( you would not have seen Dr. F sing in the Joel era as his character did a 180 when Mike took over) Anyway, Mike Nelson fans can rejoice as he is back in this volume with not just the Violent Years but ...

MST3K EPISODE 702 - THE BRUTE MAN - This movie has the Creeper ( the legendary Rondo Hatton) getting even with his college ""friends"" who disfigured him in a science experiment. It is a creaky old 1940s film that could have easily fit into the Season 1 schedule.
Some of you might recall Rondo as the Creeper in a Sherlock Holmes movie or in the Universal horror House of Horrors. The Brute Man was the least of the movies he did. We also get a short ""The Chicken of Tomorrow""

4834114,5,B005M5OS74,"MST3K Volume XXII delivers two much sought after episodes from Season Three of the show plus one from Season Six and one from Season Seven. All episodes are from the Comedy Central era of the show. The two Season Three episodes feature show creator Joel Hodgson as host and the other two feature show head writer Mike Nelson as host. This set is not a collector's special edition set, it is a ""normal"" 4-disc boxed set release.

306- TIME OF THE APES
This 1987 color TV show from Japan was edited together to make a feature length film by the Sandy Frank company. The dubbing alone will cause uncontrollable laughter when you hear the over-excited voices and constant exclamation of each others names by the main characters. The story is a loose rip-off of the original Planet Of The Apes as a young woman and two younger children survive an earthquake through cryogenic freezing and wake up in a future ruled by iron-fisted apes with ham-handed acting and cheap looking costumes. Sure going out that day was dangerous, but Johnny doesn't care and we get a terrific host segment based solely on Johnny's brief exclamation, ""I don't care!"". You'll be saying ""I don't care!"" as a catchphrase for years after you see this episode (we still do around my home two decades after first seeing it). Catherine, Caroline and Johnny meet up with a lone human, Godo, who battles against ape oppression. There's a sub-plot about the ape general seeking revenge on Godo because he thinks Godo killed his son. The party of humans is aided by an ape child named, Pepe. There's a host segment loosely tying Inherit The Wind to the hyper-evolved apes in the movie and another exploring ape fashion. And of course, there's the Sandy Frank Song performed by Joel and the 'Bots to the delight of the viewers. The movie is difficult to follow and the edits made for time by MST3K make it even more so, but the hilarity is non-stop. What happens to Catherine, Caroline and Johnny at the conclusion of their adventure in the future ruled by apes? I don't care! What matters here is the amazing comedy performance this movie becomes on MST3K. Every fan of the show should see this episode.

314- MIGHTY JACK
This 1968 Japanese color production attempts to capitalize on the popularity of the then relatively new and ultra-popular James Bond franchise by featuring secret agents and high-tech gadgets as the spy organization ""Mighty Jack"" uses their flying submarine to battle the international crime syndicate ""Q"". It's more kid friendly than the James Bond movies, but unfortunately it's also a convoluted fairly low-budget mess! The special effects are sub-standard even for the time, the plot such as it is can be more than a little difficult to follow and the acting and direction are prone at times to elicit laughter from the audience. The protagonist, super-spy Harold Hatari, is shall we say not as dashing, debonair or engaging as the 007 character from which he's knocked off. However, he is more clever than his bumbling adversaries at Q. Example, when threatened with a blinding light by his captors he closes his eyes. His enemies at Q are so incompetent they don't really have an answer for that. What a hero! The host segments in this episode are all based on the movie and they are fantastic. There's a Mighty Jack pet food commercial, the 'Bots put Joel in a blinding light chamber like the hero in the movie and the cast brainstorms underwater movie plot ideas. Then there's the musical number, ""Slow The Plot Down"" which nicely and hilariously recaps the mess that is the movie. Mighty Jack is sometimes named as a contender for the worst movie ever done on the show along with such notorious films as Manos and Hobgoblins, so this one is not to be missed.

610- THE VIOLENT YEARS (with short: YOUNG MAN'S FANCY)
This 1956 black and white film is about a young girl named Paula Parkins, the teenage daughter of wealthy parents who never manage to make any time for her. As a result she ""goes bad"", becoming the leader of a girl gang that robs, steals and even assaults young men. The script was written by Ed Wood so you know it's got to be good. The preposterous and badly acted 1952 Jam Handy short subject, A Young Man's Fancy, is about a young girl trying to get the attention of one of her brother's friends who is more interested in the household's gadgets than he is in the girl. This episode opens with some nice comedy musical numbers, such as ""Living In Deep 13"" and there's a radio station called, ""Frank"". The final host segment is a recreation of a hold-up scene in the movie only Mike and the 'Bots are better actors.

702- THE BRUTE MAN (with short: THE CHICKEN OF TOMORROW)
The Brute Man is a 1946 black and white thriller starring acromegaly victim, Rondo Hatton, who made a career out of playing hulking murderers like The Creeper in multiple films of the day. In this film he plays, Hal Moffat, who seeks revenge on those that within the story are responsible for his disfiguring injuries. The Creeper goes on a bit of killing spree, is befriended by a blind woman (she can't see his disfigured face, so she isn't afraid of him, get it?) and is hunted by the police.  It's average fare as there were certainly better, more exciting horror films produced at the time, but it's competently done and not even close to the worst movies used on the show.  The contemporaneous short subject, Chicken Of Tomorrow, was produced in 1948 and is designed to enlighten viewers about the cutting edge developments in chicken farming and is at times, more exciting than the feature film used in this episode. Host segments eschew the films being shown and go off into unrelated areas completely with a story arc about Servo getting into real estate. This episode is from the infamously short Season Seven and the future of the show was uncertain at this point to say the least, yet MST3K still managed to deliver some really funny material here even under the dire and uncertain circumstances under which they were operating at the time.

Time Of The Apes-  another Japanese clone of the Charlron Heston classic.  Pretty boring stuff un Mistified.  But with our robots' constant poop slinging jokes directed to the ""apes"", it makes mighty funny heckling!

Mighty Jack- another Sandy Frank classic.  For all the ""action"" in this movie, it still puts you to sleep unMistified.  Even with the 'bots help, it is still celluoid Sominex.

The Brute Man-  drive-in movie crap.  The 'bots have fun with this garbage

The Violent Years-  my favorite of the lot.  Not for the movie though.  The film is about juvinile delinquent girls getting in trouble and showing teen boys their boobs in sweaters.  Typical '50's teen TITtilation swill.  What makes this session a classic is Tom Servo's transformation to a real live boy with hos new good looking humanoid head.  Naturally, Mike Nelson pulls Tom's new head off!  What a hoot!  Also Mike, The Mad's and the 'bots have a singing contest!
