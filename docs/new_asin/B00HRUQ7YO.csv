8635012,2,B00HRUQ7YO,"Sadly, this was unwatchable as the kinetic edits and flashes made it too much to watch. Um, why are they rushing and throwing 15 images in 5 seconds - and using a white dissolve - which leads to insta headache? I bought this to learn, not be visually assaulted. It's like the network commercials of late; fast and loud. Perhaps the editor is 16 and has the idea that fast-and-furious will keep it interesting...but, it's a show on science; the audience is there for the session, in no rush, and probably not texting while watching.

8635013,2,B00HRUQ7YO,"I love documentaries on the Universe - and have collected several series and single selections over the years.  But upon watching  the ones included in National Geographic's ""Into The Cosmos"" collection left me deeply disappointed.  First, National Geographic seem to have the opinion that people are idiots with short attention spans.  They use ""quick-cutting"" techniques, with fast, choppy editing favored by schlock filmmakers like Michael Bay; most shots only last a second or two, and there is rapid-fire reuse of footage over and over again.  Second, the scientists quoted in the documentaries seem to be there only to spout a catchy blurb - something along the lines of ""If this event happened on earth, we would all be wiped out in a matter of seconds!"", followed by several quick computer-generated images of earth and/or major cities being wiped out.  On the plus side, there are several interesting and fun real-life demonstrations which are shown to help explain certain concepts, and those are often illuminating - and it's always nice to see scientists given the chance to shine - but National Geographic needs to have a LOT more faith in the intelligence of their viewers - we can listen to, and absorb long lines of thought, and I certainly don't need to have my eyeballs scorched by strobe-like editing.  Titles include: Inside the Milky Way, Most Powerful Stars, Stellar Storms, Hubbles Amazing Universe, Comets, and Cosmic Fury",1398384000,20,1446,5.101694915254237
