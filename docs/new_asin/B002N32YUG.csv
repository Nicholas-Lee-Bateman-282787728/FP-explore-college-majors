8478146,5,B002N32YUG,"The ""Super Sweets"" series of ""Good Eats"" DVDs are among the best from Alton Brown's fevered imagination. In Volume 5 he takes on some fairly challenging concoctions, most of which are rated ""intermediate"" under ""ease of preparation"" in the enclosed miniature recipe book. I'll say. Any time you start making doughnuts, complexities abound. Despite those difficulties, I think ""Circle of Life"" is one of the most informative shows of the series, and is absolutely fascinating (and you know anytime yeast is involved, there is bound to be quirky humor of a Brownian nature!) The other shows are also great: ""I Pie"" takes on Lemon Meringue Pie (recipe included) which is a notoriously challenging dish to get right. ""The Cookie Clause"" is a stab at a holiday special (Santa guest stars) and while the sugar cookies are an excellent staple, I was less enthused by the ""Chocolate Peppermint Pinwheel Cookies"" (though for a disclosure, I don't love mint in any form.) All three episodes are stuffed to the gills with excellent information and practical tips, all delivered with Alton's unique style. This is a great DVD and I recommend it to cooks or Food Network aficionados everywhere!",1425686400,,1181,5.030612244897959
