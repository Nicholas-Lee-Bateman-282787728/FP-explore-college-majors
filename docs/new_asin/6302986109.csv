527965,3,6302986109,"The ever-watchable Catherine Deneuve gives a complex, subtle performance in this Best Foreign Film Oscar winner which chronicles the fall of Indochina through the eyes of one of its last colonical landowners  (Deneuve). The story is pretty much pulp: Deneuve raises IndoChinese  daughter of deceased friends, has an affiar with a young French officer,  who saves the life of her daughter, who falls in love with the officer also  and....oh, never mind. The political backdrop is far more interesting but  isn't given nearly enough screen time or exposition in spite of the film's  155 minute running time. Nevertheless, it is well crafted and Deneuve is  always a joy to watch; I just wish the film had used the political context  of the somewhat overripe story to better effect.",928195200,8,779,5.03125

528208,5,6302986109,"I wasn't sure what I was going to get from this movie.  I knew only that it starred the delightful Catherine Deneuve (one of those ageless actresses who has managed to maintain her talent over numerous decades) and that it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film back in 1992.  Outside of that, I wasn't really sure of the plot.  I saw that Deneuve owned a plantation and that she falls in love with the same man her daughter loves, but that read soap opera love triangle forgettable pulp to me and so I was really expecting to be disinterested with this.

I loved this movie.

I'll say this, parts of this film reminded me of `A Handful of Dust', which I thought was a total hot mess of a film.  I say this because the plot is ever changing and at times thrusts its stars in these situations that feel wholly abrupt, yet what makes this film different is that it all comes together in a very cohesive and fascinating tale of love, war, betrayal, fear, heartbreak and eventual retribution.

`Indochine' takes place in 1930, during the end of French colonial rule in Indochina and tells the story of Eliane.  Eliane is a French woman who helps manage a rubber plantation in Indochina with her father.  When her good friends are killed, they left behind their daughter Camille, a Vietnamese Princess who then Eliane raises as her very own daughter.  When Camille is grown she falls for a young Naval officer who she mistakenly believes saved her life.  The problem is that this officer, Jean-Baptiste, has been having an affair with Eliene.  In a rash move, Eliane has the man transferred so as to spare her the heartbreak of having him return her daughter's affections.  This doesn't stop Camille from devoting herself to being with him, and this action eventually backfires on Eliane as she loses not only her lover but her daughter when Camille flees her arranged marriage to find Jean-Baptiste.  From this point forward, the general tone of the film shifts as the details become more evident.  The communist revolt against French rule and the threat of disease become focal points as Camille and Jean-Baptiste are reunited and forced into seclusion.  The story, narrated by Eliane, is magnificently fleshed out and fulfilled from start to finish.

Catherine Deneuve is a revelation here, wearing such intricate emotional body on her face.  Vincent Perez and Linh Dan Pham are remarkably authentic as the doomed lovers, and Jean Yanne charmed me in ways he never could Deneuve.  Director Regis Wargnier works magic with this narrative, and both Patrick Doyle and Francois Catonne should be singled out for their remarkable work on the film's score and cinematography respectively.

This is an intricate tale told with ambition and passion and deserves to be loved by all!",1363910400,,2768,4.79957805907173

528210,5,6302986109,"In English

Her feminine soul laid bare - is the dominant theme in this European classic ""Indochine"" (In French, 1992, Academy Award and Golden Globe Awards for Best Foreign Language Film); with renowned actress Catherine Deneuve (as its centerpiece). In the Prologue, liane Devries (Deneuve) is a French plantation owner, who adopts a Vietnamese orphaned daughter Camille (Linh Dan Pham). The setting is colonial French Indochina during the 1930s. This 159 minute epic tragic-drama so adheres to the natural principles of story-telling: it is easy to get lost in the political chaos, mayhem, upheaval, violence, and restoration of a country beset with revolution and war. Yet we rise above the turmoil to relish the dramatic turns by the brilliant, formitable acting of Deneuve (at her very best), driving the plot, character, and theme (as only a gifted actress can); investing of herself - heart and soul as a flawed but noble matriarch - what surely must be her crowning glory as a film thespian. Unities of plot and character run strong throughout. Ironies run full hilt. Emotive, natural acting achieved with finesse by Vincent Perez, Linh Dan Pham, Jean Yanne, Dominique Blanc, and a truly fine cast of character actors.

Superlative direction by Rgis Wargnier, music by Patrick Doyle, cinematography by Franois Catonn, editing by Agns Schwab and Genevive Winding; original novel by Erik Orsenna; screenwriting credits by Louis Gardel, Catherine Cohen, and Wargnier. liane Devries in her torment, straight out of Dante's Inferno, displayed `her ascending nobility' so precisely: it sustained the central meaning within this film, namely that the human spirit cannot always be conquered by war or strife.

Although this is a beautiful movie, I'm awarding it 2 stars because of the very poor quality of the recording, and only because of that.

It almost looks like the movie was re-recorded with a handheld camera, before it was written to DVD.

The sound quality is poor, as is the video quality.  And when titles appear on screen, you can actually see the text moving around / floating.  To me, a sure indication that this DVD wasn't printed from the original film.

I've contacted Arrowfilms for comment (the distributor), but haven't heard back yet.  I'll try to update this review once/if I do.

There does seem to be different prints available of Indochine DVD.  Maybe the others offer better quality.

528244,4,6302986109,"There is some difference of opinion about whether this is a good film or not.  Some have called it a ""soap opera"" beautifully filmed.  (Both Leonard Maltin in his Movie and Video Guide and the good people at Video Hound used that designation.)  But I don't think that is correct at all.  Beautifully filmed yes, stunning at times like something from David Lean; and in fact this film has more in common with the Hollywood panoramic epic than it does with the tradition of the French cinema.  But it is certainly not a soap opera.  In a soap opera the important element is a narrow focus on things material, social, and sexual played out in a banal, cliche-ridden and bourgeois manner.  In Indochine the focus is on political change and why it came about.
The story begins in Vietnam in 1930 and concludes on the eve of the communist revolution in 1954--presaging the tragic American involvement a decade later.  Catherine Deneuve plays Eliane Devries, the strong-willed owner of a rubber plantation in Vietnam, then part of the French colonial empire.  Having no children of her own (or a husband) she raises the Vietnamese girl Camille (Linh Dan Pham) as her own.  She conducts secret affairs (and even visits opium dens) while maintaining the appearance of respectability. We are shown the decadence of the French living in Vietnam and the exploitive evils of colonialism, hardy the stuff of soap opera.  We are made aware of the social unrest stirring amongst the population and even shown what amounts to a slave auction conducted by the colonial powers with the aid of the French military, in particular, the French navy.
Enter Jean-Baptiste (Vincent Perez), a handsome French naval officer who, despite the difference in their ages, initiates an affair with Eliane.  She is at first put off, then reluctant, and then madly in love.  Perhaps this familiar progression is what some think of as soap opera material; and perhaps it is, although their affair is only a small part of the film, and at any rate, such behavior is entirely consistent with Eliane's character and that of Jean-Baptiste, and is necessary for the plot developments to come.
Deneuve was nominated for Best Actress by the Academy but didn't win (Emma Thompson won for Howard's End), but the film itself won as Best Foreign Film.  In truth Deneuve's performance is a little uneven.  Regardless, this is one of the most important roles in the career of an actress who was as beautiful in 1991 when this film was made as she had been in The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964) at the beginning of her career.  Indeed, I would say even more beautiful.  My favorite Deneuve film, by the way, is Mississippi Mermaid (1969) with Jean-Paul Belmondo directed by Francois Truffaut.
Also uneven is the direction by Regis Wargnier.  The scenes set in Saigon involving the French and the Mandarins at their pleasures amid their wealth as they maintain their privilege are done with strikingly beautiful interiors splashed with the kind of color seen in, for example, the films of Chinese director Zhang Yimou.  The scenes amount to indictments of the French and demonstrate why the communists eventually came to power.  Note that the privileged are always decked out in the most amazing displays of color while the workers and the peasants are brown and dirty.
The panoramic cinematography of the Vietnamese country is also strikingly beautiful.  We are shown the sheer cliffs falling into tranquil waters dotted with junks, the rock outcrops nestled in verdant growth, the angry skies, and the deluge of the monsoon.  But the trek of Camille across the land to find her beloved is not realistically done.  Her quick incorporation in a peasant family is also not convincing.  And the following scene in which she and Jean-Baptiste escape from the slave market defies probability.  However what becomes of her and him is brutally realistic and consistent with what we know about those times, although I would like to have seen them being fed when they are rescued and some indication of how they spent their time in that Shangri-la-like hidden valley.
Despite the flaws and inconsistencies, this is a fine cinematic experience, enthralling, disturbing and visually beautiful.  See this as a prelude to all other films about Vietnam and the Vietnam War.  What will become clear is how foolish was our involvement and how doomed to failure it had to be.",1081382400,28,4406,4.910931174089069

The kids get totally engrossed and there is enough historical backrgound to facilitate several lessons:  1)European Imperialism, 2) French Involvement in Vietnam, 3) Vietnamese Nationalism, and 4) the Mandarin Class in Vietnam.  I have shown this video for three years now.  The kids consitently rate it tops and they enjopy the writing assignment/learning log I assign with it.  The characters are complex and well developed.  As a Vietnam veteran, I also appreciate the movie in its own right.  This is one great flick.",985392000,11,637,5.0
528251,5,6302986109,"I quite agree; sometimes, even critics I respect (sort of) are buffoons when it comes to movies.  This movie, as Hannah12 stated so aptly in her review, IS indeed haunting.  And beautiful.  And thoughtful.  It is not a happy story, certainly, and that is what gives it it's power.  The actors are all incredible, as is the scenery, and when I get to be 55, I want to look half as beautiful and poised as Catherine Deneuve.  This movie is one of the first that caught my fascination with foreign films.  It DESERVED that Oscar.",974505600,2,526,4.473684210526316
528252,2,6302986109,"Imagine a sort of Gone With The Wind where Scarlette is a Confederate feminist who has kicked Daddy into early retirement. She swaps about half her gowns for stuff that Rhett Butler didn't want anymore. She makes a point of personally flogging slaves, but manages to do it without (miraculously, in the heat of humidity of Southeast Asia) having a bad hair day. Imagine that the plot is designed for a long mini-series, but has been squeezed into a feature-length film. Imagine some really fine actors struggling to breathe life into this thing. This is one of those films that makes wonderful trailers and stills you could turn into art, but that just doesn't work as a movie. I know a man who was a young draftee in Vietnam. He once told me, ""You know those Chinese paintings with the twisted trees and the misty landscapes? Well, it really looks like that."" If this film is any indication, he was right. The landscape is the best part of this film. Mostly, this movie is just tragic and sad, which is probably the point. If I had been in her shoes, I would have sold the plantation, taken my adopted daughter, and made a beeline for the south of France the day after the communists blew the brains of of the village elder I was being introduced to. I must say that Miss Deneuve still looks wonderful; the thirties fashions, especially those marvelous hats, really flatter her.",973382400,12,1379,4.609756097560975

Even if you did not speak French and the subtitles were not included, every moment would be crystal clear.  It often is difficult to forget that you are watching roles being played out when seeing a movie, but not in this case.  Though it is rather long, every moment is important and interesting; there are no extraneous scenes or lines.  You could watch 'Indochine' over and over again and never be tired of it.",972172800,4,485,4.878048780487805

The French influence  in South Vietnam is still very strong. Vietnam is as beautiful as reflected  in this film. If, like me, you don't care for films with sub-titles, or  things French, give this one a shot. You will be very glad that you did.",965692800,10,445,4.325301204819277

Everytime I check out one of the foreign films cited as ""best"", I should  remember to take a nap before viewing.  Anyone who would leave home for Mr.  Lopez and travel a kajillion miles, starve in a prison and become a commie  as a result, must have lived a very sheltered life.

528307,5,6302986109,"This film encompasses many themes, and is overall a very fufilling movie.  I really found this movie inspirational in my studies of french.  This movie really teaches one who is interested in the end of the French  Colonization of Vietnam.  The symbolic relationship of Catherine Deneuve  with her adopted daughter is particularly moving when you examine it on two  levels.  One, the emotional seperation of a mother from her daughter.  Two,  this seperation also illustrates the Vietnamese people's choice to turn  away from the French rule.  In essence, when the daughter chooses to leave  her french mother, it displays the choice to become one with her people and  to turn away from the ideals even of her adpoted mother.  Overall I believe  that this movie is one which should be viewed by all those who are  interested in Vietnam and the signifigance of the French colonization  there.",947721600,23,891,4.9523809523809526
