7867805,2,6304293836,"I got this tape when I believe a reviewer had it on his all time worst list.  Talk about unstructured, with a pretense of a plot, but just general zaniness, although not slapstick.  It is done by a repertoire company on a wooden stage, sort of like a theater in the round, and is perhaps set in Appalachia.  Hard to tell if the audience is part of the company, or part of the populace.  To say it is weird is an understatement.

It is very unlikely one will ever see a stranger movie.  For younger viewers (but over 18!) the movie captures the hippy atmosphere of the 1960's.  Not for the average tastes.  But not vulgar either.  Just very strange.",1196553600,,648,4.333333333333333
7867806,4,6304293836,"A very touching beastiality flick...Done very charming for a plot that revolves around a guy and his Piggy friend.  Watch out...Kermit might get jealous!  This movie is really entertaining nonetheless, and it really isn't as disgusting as it sounds.  It is definately worth seeing, but I advise you to rent it before you buy it, because its definately not for everyone!!",983491200,5,370,5.032786885245901
