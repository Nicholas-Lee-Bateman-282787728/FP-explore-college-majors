2265751,2,B00094ASC2,"I read Prozac Nation about a year ago and by the time I got to the end of it I found myself with a book full of underlined paragraphs. The book was indeed very good, and truly depicted Elizabeth at her most vulnerable state. That being in a void of depression and knowing that the only thing responsible for it was herself.

No sooner than finishing the book had my friend pulled out a japanese release of it on DVD. The more I watched the sicker I got. The movie turns Elizabeth's character into a ""fated teen"", displaying her as if the back of her hand was indefinately attached to her forehead. Simply overdramatic and very annoying.

Now don't get me wrong, I love Christina Ricci. I loved her most in The Opposite of Sex, which was just another display of how amazing she can be on screen. It wasn't her performance in Prozac Nation that disappointed me, it was the overdramatics of it all that did.",1119830400,5,904,4.407185628742515
2265752,5,B00094ASC2,"Fear of most was that this film would never be released on DVD.  It's such a touchy subject.... and I think many people close their eyes to stuff like this because they don't want to believe that it exsists.  Many people suffer with severe depression and this is a Prozac nation.... but so many people out there don't want to take the time to understand what these people are going through, so the comments are always made that only end up hurting the depressed person.  I've been in Lizzie's (Ricci) shoes.... more than many can imagine..... and the words said to lizzie by her friends were just what was said to me time and time again.... and they only made things worse.... they didn't understand, thats true -- but they didn't take the time to understand.... and sometimes even made it look like the understood when they really didnt.

I think that those people who are really depressed would benefit if the entire world watched this movie.  This movie gives an excellent glimpse into what depressed people deal with.  But don't let it worry you... the film is entertaining... it's enjoyable to watch but it will get to you at the same time... Ricci is certainly amazing in this film.... one of the best performances by any actress ever.... she IS the character.... she is really into it..... it's phenomenal.

Buy this DVD... you need it.... and if you have a loved one in your family that deals with depression or another mental illness, you don't only need it but it's your duty to watch it....",1118102400,6,1501,4.620300751879699
2265753,5,B00094ASC2,"Miss Ricci can do more with an expression than most actresses can with with a full-body contortion. This journey from heck to hell to heaven back to hell to, well, back to life is just plain dandy. If you like substance over fluff and do not need exploding helicopters or sociopaths with chainsaws, buy this movie.",1115596800,7,314,4.625
2265754,5,B00094ASC2,"I was scrolling through my options on my  OnDemand  starz . I  was drawn in by the promise of seeing Ricci in another film.  this movie was amazing, i am  like in love with  Ricci. In ways  we can all relate to the caharacter that she played, ive heard that there is a book that this movie was made from but i have not read it. I just might. I am in  no doubt that im going to buy this when it comes out on dvd ..",1114992000,,413,3.6666666666666665
2265785,4,B00094ASC2,Ricci did a trarific job with acting like she had this problem. I have a new appreciation of there plight.,1354060800,,106,4.35
2265786,5,B00094ASC2,"Prozac Nation is about a college girl who seems to have everything going for her.  A promising future as a writer, the opportunity to meet big name rock stars such as Lou Reed, immediate friendships with her roommates and other students, a boyfriend who cares deeply about her, and the chance to write for major rock publications such as Rolling Stone magazine.

What can disrupt such a bright future?  Depression, drugs, and frequent suicide attempts to name just a few things... and my goodness do they ever ruin this young girls life.  She's now a *monster*.  With these personal demons taking over, she's now unstable, unfriendly, unprofessional, and psychotic too.  She's a different person.  None of the people in her life -such as her friends and especially her mother- can get through to her, or even understand the magnitude of the problems that have basically given her a one way ticket to the mental institution.

Christina's character nails a really wonderful performance by being believable in her role.  She shows what it really is like being someone who's battling severe anger issues, drug addiction, depression and suicide.  At first she chalks it up to being stressed out but we soon realize the problem spirals much deeper than that.  Christina Ricci's character is flat out insane.  Whenever she blurts out something unusual and exceptionally mean, it always hurts the people that are only trying to reach out and help her.  It's amazing how much support she tries to receive but rejects time and time again.  The average person wouldn't be willing to help this much, in fact, especially since her roommates don't even know her very well.

The acting is amazingly good.  This is NO ordinary college flick involving parties, drugs and alcohol.  This is all about Christina's personal issues coming to light and destroying not only the joyous times she was in the process of having with her roommates, but mainly the relationship with her mother and father.  The mother is another really extraordinary character- feeling powerless, sad and embarrassed for her daughter.  The segment with the grandparents is most startling.

It's really a moving film.  Clearly Christina Ricci was the right person for this role.  Great job picking out just the right person by all the directors and writers of the movie.  A must see movie.",1353974400,,2341,4.992248062015504
2265787,5,B00094ASC2,I get the feeling no one saw this in the theater and few knew of it's existence on dvd.  I love Elizabeth Wurtzel and this is a faithful adaptation of her book.  Anyone between the ages of 15-25 who is suffering from depression should see this film.,1348704000,,249,4.276595744680851
2265788,4,B00094ASC2,"Prozac Nation was a good movie C. Ricci I have to give her some props she has proven to be a very good actress I've seen her in a few movies and she always seems to bring out her character's. She has that look about her . The movie over all was a good movie the only parts that got a little carried away was when her and the lady that played her mother would get in talks or arguments they got a bit carried away with that, but I'm sure it was big part in that lady's book so they had to bring that out. But over all a very good movie worth the money to see.",1344902400,,558,3.73728813559322
2265789,5,B00094ASC2,I have an ex girlfriend who is a dire depressant and I totally remember the mood swings and we had the same argument as in the movie about her thinking that I wanted to sleep with someone else. Christina Ricci is a superior actress and she nailed this role perfectly.,1338249600,,267,4.36
2265790,3,B00094ASC2,"Overall this is a pretty good movie, though it is a rather dark and dramatic tale.
This movie is based on a book, written by the girl who lived through this to find herself. I have not read the book so I can't compare it.
This would not be a good date movie or family movie, too much drama and adult content.
The story follows a troubled girl, a writer, just as she finishes high and moves away to college. And while she seems to have all the opportunities in the world, she also has a lot of personal issues, not the least of which is a broken home and self hatred. Of course college doesn't ""make her all better"" and she begins a downward spiral and ends up going into therapy, and eventually put on perscription medication. She loves and looses friends and relationships along the way, as well as her ability to write. Interesting story.
The acting was great, very dramaticly intense scences that made you feel for the girl. The story was a little slow in areas (not sure how the book faired with this), and some very odd directing in areas as well (that could either be enriching or distracting depending on your tastes).
I think I would buy this movie for my collection, though I doubt I would watch it a lot.",1331596800,,1214,4.352422907488987
2265791,5,B00094ASC2,"christina ricci is a great actress and very indie in a way.she does roles that many actresses won't do and her role in prozac nation was amazing all around,great story and the fact that she is wiling to do these kinds of films makes her a star to me",1304726400,,249,4.1020408163265305
2265792,5,B00094ASC2,"Christina Ricci does an excellent job in this movie. Prozac Nation is actually based on the book Prozac Nation which the author is actually writing about her life. I found this movie to be somewhat depressing as I watched it but by the end of the movie it got better. I would recommend this movie to parents and young adults, I think depression affects a lot of people and they don't realize it or don't want to be told they need medication for depression. This movie brings out a lot of emotions and is done very well.",1298937600,,519,4.360824742268041
2265793,3,B00094ASC2,"Everyone is going to tell you that this is story of one young woman's depression, don't believe it.  What you're looking at is borderline personality disorder (BPD) which has depression as a feature.  Wurzel is presented as needy, self-absord, steeped in selfishness, somewhat psychotic bitch who cannot see past her own bleeding pain.  I gave the film three stars because Ricci is brilliant and the story is incredibly sincere. Just don't think this is a story of someone who's mental issue is that of depression alone, its totally misleading.",1297296000,9,544,5.089887640449438
2265794,5,B00094ASC2,"I haven't read Elizabeth Wurtzels book so I cannot compare the two, but I think that Prozac Nation, although occasionally uncomfortable, was also an accurate representation of depression. As a sufferer myself, I found myself nodding in parts (her explanations of her feelings), cringing in others (when she is so cruel to her best friend) and crying during some scenes - those with her mother. When she frantically apologises she shows that  much of her bad behaviour is out of her control. She's cruel to people because she feels that she doesn't deserve anyone, and she's frustrated that they don't understand her.

I fell in love with Rafe (he was just so nice!)

I'm not convinced though that if you have no prior experience of or interest in mental illness, this film would be of that great interest. It is melancholy, and tough to watch at times, but Ricci's acting was superb, as were the supporting cast.",1294185600,,912,4.796178343949045
2265805,4,B00094ASC2,Awesome performance by Christina Ricci. The part I didn't like is the movie made me question my own sanity because in some ways I could relate to that crazy character!,1291766400,,167,4.6
2265806,4,B00094ASC2,"I started to suffer from depression 2 yrs ago and went to the bookstore looking for information, i stumbled across the excellent 'prozac nation' by Elizabeth Wurtzel, i read the book then bought the movie of the same name, to be honest although i like the movie, i prefered the book as i feel the film is too rushed, it tends to very quickly bounce along and tries to encompass all the elements too quickly, it could easily have been twice the length and dealt in more detail what Elizabeth was actually going through, i could totally relate to the way Elizabeth was feeling and the emotions were very well portrayed by Ricci.

Having said that, the acting of the cast is very good, Christina Ricci is excellent!

i would have given the film a 5 star if it had been much longer and more drawn out.",1280534400,,797,4.414965986394558
2265807,3,B00094ASC2,"I try to catch as many movies of Christina Ricci as I can being a fan of hers. There's a small handful I enjoy and most of the others are just so-so. For me Prozac Nation falls into the so-so category. For starters, aside from the story or performance, Christina seems to be in between her ""chubby"" state and her latter very thin state. I prefer her fuller-figured frame but the look in this movie is well balanced for her.

For the movie itself, I just couldn't really get into it. It wasn't horrible to watch but after one viewing I had no desire to watch it again anytime in the future. I feel Ricci did what she could for the role but the story is lacking. In addition to the movie, there is an extra feature called 'Anatomy of a Scene'(19:41). You also get Engish and Spanish subtitles as well as spoken language.",1264636800,,818,4.311688311688312
2265808,1,B00094ASC2,"In the real world of art Elizabeth Wurtzel is the sexy drama queen every guy wants to do, but no guy wants to wake up next to. Her on-screen portrayer, Christina Ricci, is the ugly artsy wannabe girl that desperately wants every and any guy, but no guy will touch her. That's why, in Prozac Nation, the unreleased 2001 film of Wurtzel's 1990s bestseller book of the same name, there are immediate problems. Ok, the problems start before the miscast of Ricci, who has the emotional range of a thimble- is it any wonder that, by far, her finest acting was in the two Addams Family films? First off, she is bizarre looking- with big eyes and a bulging forehead, making her look like the fetal Starchild from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Secondly, she always plays whiney brats. But, thirdly, is the way films try to make it appear any guy would be attracted to her. In one scene in the film her pal Ruby (Michelle Williams) and Liz walk through Harvard, and all the guys' tongues are wagging at Ricci, not the super-cute and sexy Williams. Hello....Reality check time.... This material begged for the Andy Warhol treatment. Here is his version of the film. A five minute shot of a hypodermic needle. A five minute shot of Wurtzel's hairy pudenda. A five minute shot of her sleeping naked and stoned on the bed. She rises, gives the middle finger to the audience. Cue credits. See, less than twenty minutes to distill Wurtzel's whole life. And, oh yeah, Warhol's film would not have cast Ricci. Even Michelle Williams would have been better, and after seeing Ricci's pallid bosom, I'd take anything Williams or any other babe had to offer me cinematically. Ricci is almost the kiss of death for a film, and how she stays working is a mystery. Think of her performances in mediocre to bad films like Monster, Sleepy Hollow, and Woody Allen's Anything Else- also co-starring Jason Biggs, and now picture another actress in her role, and immediately the films could seem better, if not great. She is the female counterpart to banal, wooden, milquetoast actors like Tom Cruise and Leonardo Dicaprio.",1221436800,5,2085,4.715068493150685
2265809,5,B00094ASC2,"I picked up this movie from a discount bin because it had a picture of Christina Richie on it. She has always intrigued me. I was stunned to find a movie of substance and deep emotional material.

Late the other night, I was tired, but not enough to sleep, so I popped Prozac Nation into my DVD player and watched. I wondered, why didn't I know more about this movie which had such talented actors in it? As the movie progressed I was amazed at the quality in acting, the beautiful cinematography, the flowing direction which neither tried to placate me or reduce the story to idiocy such that I could get it on the first try.

Prozac Nation is exactly the kind of movie I want. It has depth and truth and tells it like it is. It wasn't until near the end that I even realized that this was a movie about depression. When it was over I was transfixed, eager to know more about the writer, pleased that Ms Richie took on such a complicated and misunderstood subject, amazed at the astounding performance of Jessica Lange.

That night I couldn't sleep. My mind was racing analyzing what I had just experienced. I wanted to know more only to find mixed review. Rotten Tomatoes gave it the worst movie of 2005. The lack of interest in the movie sadden me, I needed to know more. Finally after more searching I discovered this site with people who found this movie as amazing as I did. I was not alone in my admiration of a story so well told.

I have such disdain for movies these days, so little substance and nothing of real value. It is rare that a movie can affect me as Prozac Nation did. If you are interested in a movie which does not lower itself to the typical lethargic audience of today and want to provoke your thoughts and emotions then I recommend you see this movie.",1209340800,3,1777,4.343373493975903
2265810,3,B00094ASC2,"A decent film about a young woman's battle with Mental illness.  I would guess though that the book was better. The ending of this seemed rushed.  Unfortunatley, the movies seemed choppy, melodramatic, and just kinda blah.  Worth watching, kinda interesting for a person that works in the field.",1208044800,,295,5.104166666666667
2265811,2,B00094ASC2,"I really liked the book version of Prozac Nation.  It is a hard read in places, parts of it seem like the author wrote them on speed, the protagonist is also the antagonist, it drags a bit in places... but it perfectly captures the zietgiest, it is so baldly, terribly honest that it makes you flinch, and by the end, after you have been through ten years of depression, therapy, and bad behavior with Lizzie, you are just relieved that the Prozac worked.  That is a huge element that I think most people take away from the book, that while Prozac or SSRIs in general can be a godsend for some people, they have become almost absurdly overprescribed, and not after a decade of treatment, but a 15 minute medical consultation.

The movie leaves all this behind.  Yes, Lizzie is hard to watch, but there is no further, deeper explaination.  And the writers of the screenplay tried to condense ten years into one, and the story arc really suffers for that.  There is no plot-- and while you could make the argument that the book was plotless, the movie version becomes ultraplotless.  Rather than the meandering of the book, the movie is oddly stagnant.  The worst thing I can say about this movie is that it completely misses the point of the book- the misgivings the author has about psychiatry, even though it has helped her; the misgivings she has about a physically healthy person taking drugs after drugs, even though she needs them to function; the malaise of an entire nation of people (NOT just the author) that seems to have become a sign of the times.  In the end, all the awareness of the author's world has been stripped away by the filmmakers, and left an already selfish and self-destructive characterization into an even more self absorbed character.  The movie version of Lizzie is almost nothing at all.

On the plus side of this movie, the acting is strong.  Way too strong for such a pitiful script, and the actors seem to know it.  Jessica Lange, in particular, acts like she's in a different movie altogether.  Only Christina Ricci seems to really inhabit this movie, and she is compelling, the only unequivocally good thing about this film.

This movie got shelved for years because it isn't very good, and moreover, it isn't at all true to a book that was, in it's way, quite groundbreaking.  It's just too bad.",1204848000,3,2332,4.637469586374696

There were numerous reedits and problems with distrubution. Despite respectable stars in Christina Ricci, Jason Biggs (American Pie), Anne Heche and Michelle Williams (Brokeback Mountain), it premiered on the Starz channel and then went straight to video. The troubled teen girl genre was probably overdone in the 90s, raising the standard for any new films that delve into the still unsettling issues of female promiscuity, drug abuse, mental illness and eating disorders.

The narration by Ricci is the main tie to the novel, but I have always felt narration is used by unimaginitive writers who cannot produce good dialogue. The film centers on a character based on a Harvard freshman who experiments with sex, drugs and other 'bad' behavior with reckless abandon. Not only does she proclaim her loss of virginity in a one-night-stand, she throws a party celebrating the fact. An hour into the movie we are tired of watching the pointless self-destruction of yet another teen girl.

2265813,3,B00094ASC2,"What strikes me most about this film is that nearly all information about it depicts it as a young woman's struggle with depression.  The character (at least in the movie) being portrayed certainly appears to be experiencing depression, to be sure.  However, barely 15 minutes into this picture, the presence of her Borderline Personality Disorder is amazingly clear.  This condition, often accompanied by depression, exerts an impact on the effected person that can span from problematic to disabling.  It is often overwhelming for the individual, people around them and care providers.  I comment on this to clarify that the person depicted in this film is not, by any stretch of the imagination, merely dealing with ""depression"".  Truthfully, that was probably the least of her struggles.  While I certainly don't know what this woman went through, the notion that people would come to see her experience as characteristic of merely ""depression"" is troubling indeed.  As  a mental health provider who has worked with people experiencing Borderline Personality Disorder, depression or both, it's vital to understand the importance of disordered personality in a person struggles.  Most people with depression do not cut themselves, flirt persistently with suicide, behave impulsively with regard to sex and drugs, or have acute and unpredictable episodes of anger, hostility or cruelty toward others; all of those are common features of Borderline Personality Disorder.  Perhaps the most poignant line in the film comes when Elizabeth's friend Ruby, with tears in her eyes, appears to stun and anger Elizabeth by stating ""I'm not crying because of what you said.  I'm crying because I can't imagine how painful it must be to be you.""  Individuals suffering from this personality disorder may sum it up exactly this way.

For clarity, depression is a mental health condition with natural periods of periods of mood change, difficulty with sleep, energy, guilt, loss of interest, problems concentrating, reduced appetite and, sometimes, suicidal thoughts and/or behavior.  A loss of interest in sexual activity, and feelings of hopelessness or helplessness can occur as well.  For nearly all people experiencing depression, these episodes will eventually resolve in weeks or months, even if untreated.  By contrast, Borderline personality disorder is a far more enduring pattern of thoughts and behaviors that profoundly effect how a person relates to others and the world around them.  The latter much more accurately represents the individual depicted in this film.  Depression and Borderline Personality Disorder can co-exist.  However, confusing them altogether, as this movie and all advertising around it do quite effectively, is misleading at best.

What I really appreciated about the film is the main character's awareness that her own life experiences were playing a role in her perceptions of the world.  The use of Prozac, which is central to the title but having only a bit part in the film, is seen not as a fix-all but, rather, as a compliment to an understanding of her experiences and behaviors through therapy and self-exploration.  This film does a great cinematic job portraying the experiences of what it's like to be around someone with Borderline Personality Disorder.  However, it's only through Ricci's voice-over during the film, which share the character's thoughts, that viewers may have some sense of what it's like to actually live with this condition.  The characters struggle and eventually reconciling to a treatment involving self-exploration, medications and therapy will satisfy some but likely raise the ire of those opposed to the concept of mental health care or the use of psychoactive medications.

I'd give it 4 stars, but took 1 off because of the off-the-mark depiction of ""depression"", which tells only half the tale regarding the individual portrayed in this film, leaving the role of personality disorder completely hidden from view.",1202169600,52,3980,5.368760064412238
2265814,5,B00094ASC2,"If Prozac Nation's sensibility feels a bit sketchy at times, it may be because it divides our sympathies. It's hard to feel much compassion for Elizabeth Wurtzel, this beautiful, talented, overachieving Harvard scholar who wins a coveted college journalism award and a chance to write for Rolling Stone magazine before she's out of her teens. Her dramas feel like the tangled, self-involved chaos of adolescence, curled up in a ball surrounded by the debris of indulgence. Why should we care?

In fact, it's precisely this messy picture that the disease of depression creates, and the filmmakers show greater-than-average sensitivity in adapting Wurtzel's memoir. This is what depression looks like: Reckless glamor on the outside, a gaping hole on the inside. Wurtzel's friends and lovers drop off one by one in the harrowing wake of her disease; only her mother, played with great power by Jessica Lange, hangs on, in love and desperation. Christina Ricci is perfect casting for Wurtzel, because despite the fact that she looks scrumptious with a champagne glass, her eyes have the same scary eat-you-alive quality that cast her perfectly as Wednesday Addams when she was much younger.

What I love about this movie is that it doesn't try to whitewash the paradoxes of depression, the hurtful acting-out, the monstrous folly of it, the bad choices made solely in order to feel something different than either numbness or raw psychic pain. If you hate the depression, you don't necessarily have to love the depressive; Wurtzel has to earn our trust again and again, and the Prozac of the title doesn't transform her automatically into a better person. The movie does a bit of semi-tidy resolution by the end titles, but the heroine remains an ambivalent figure. Which is as it should be--she's finally able to face herself without tumbling automatically into the void. This is required viewing for anybody who loves someone with depression.",1201737600,,1941,5.1198738170347005

However the life of drugs and sex at university is not always the best enviroment for someone as fragile as Elizabeth, and she begins to fall about, as she is abandoned by her friends and boyfriend.
Undoubtedly Christina Ricci's talent is what makes this a five star production.
A sensitive and hopefully revealing look at the world of depression and mental illnes , adapted from the book by Elizabeth Wurtzel. One has to understand the phenomenon to really sympathize with what Christina's character is going through, which her university friends clearly dont.

The value of the plot is immense, I just didn't think that as a package the film delivered it well. The acting was great, though I constantly found myself thinking that Michelle Williams looked so much older than the rest of her peers that the illusion of college was broken for me. I wanted the film to be this deep commentary on our sanctioned drug culture via the mental health audience and I never felt that it got there. It was more a noncommital nontreatment of mental conditions.",1165795200,4,659,4.593220338983051
2265842,2,B00094ASC2,"This movie is not grand on a the memoirs scale of ""Grande"" to me...there are better.  I can't really understand why these flicks of ""female depression memoirs"" are becoming so popular lately... I could pull my hair out watching the tension and angst of Anjolina Jolie and Brittany Murphy in ""Girl Interrupted"", but not in ""Prozac Nation"".  For one, Christina Ricci does not do anything for me as an actress.  Yes, she looks cool in that Moby video, but really...she is just a bug-eyed over-hyped former ""goth actress"" -she could star in ""Memoirs of Winona from Beetlejuice"".  Anyway, that said, Ricci at least gets the roll right aesthetically-she has her pants tightly rolled at her ankles, dons the heavy black plastic bangles and rolls her eyes on cue. I can give her credit for these efforts.  She brings out the worst of the 80's -enough shoulder padding to drive anyone to Prozac.

What I really dislike is the idea that this book or movie captures a ""new"" idea.

I think the DVD would be a better ""after school special"".  It doesn't thrill me or make me feel moved to be a better person.  I can't find anything in the script that says ""I am different from most young women's lives at college"".  Plenty of talented, smart women make mistakes in college-many abuse drugs, sleep with all the wrong men, and hate their mothers-this one wrote a book and sold it to a publisher.  Where is the taboo here?  Where are the revelations so terrible I need to peek through my fingers just to absorb them slowly? Even ""Prozac"" isn't tied into the movie physically until the end.  There really is nothing here-just a diary with so-so actors playing out the roles.",1163030400,4,1656,4.649484536082475
2265843,3,B00094ASC2,"I thought that the main problem with Prozac Nation was that it just seemed to lack focus. The movie obviously compressed a lot of details in the book, but I think if it had just focused on the main crisis of the book, the character's descent into depression would have been easier to understand and empathize. As it was, it tried to do that, but it also tried to cram in other things, and I feel that if I hadn't read the book or gone through something similar myself, I would not have understood why Lizzie was so afflicted at this particular point in her life.

I thought the acting was excellent: Michelle Williams and Jason Biggs were great, and Christina Ricci was phenomenal, capturing the entire range of the pain and anger and self-loathing of depression. I thought Jessica Lange put in a good performance, although her bizarre accent and the fact that she in no way resembles the darker and petite Christina Ricci was really distracting. I was simply unable to believe she was her mother, and certainly not a Jewish mother.

If you've suffered from severe depression, then watch it and know that there are other people who feel the same way you do and think the same thoughts as you, and who would understand why you feel and act the way you do. Otherwise, skip it. If you don't understand depression before going into the film, it is unlikely that this it will shed any light on the topic for you. It's pretty much impossible to understand unless you've been there yourself.",1160352000,10,1484,4.575187969924812
2265844,4,B00094ASC2,"""Prozac Nation"" is one of those movies that gets great reviews from critics and are generally unliked by audiences. I liked it, but I don't see what all the fuss is about. The movie boasts a tremendous cast including Christina Ricci

(Buffalo 66), Oscar Winner Jessica Lange (Best Actress, ""Tootsie""), Oscar Nominee Michelle Williams (Best Supporting Actress, ""Brokeback Mountain""), Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Match Point), Anne Heche (Psycho),

and Jason Biggs (American Pie). Most of the reviews for the film mention how great Ricci is and yes, her performance is great...But it's nothing to brag about.

Ricci plays Elizabeth ""Lizzie"" Wurtzel, a girl who thinks her life is hard. Her father left at a young age and turns up periodically and her mother (Lange) is completely overbearing. One thing Lizzie always did well at however was writing and now she's on her way to Harvard. Once there, she has a roommate named Ruby (Williams) and is finally starting to be noticed by boys. The first boy she meets is Noah (Rhys-Meyers) who gives her ecstasy, which is her first experiment with drugs. Pretty soon, despite being fairly successful, she begins a downward spiral. Drugs, sex, drinking, partying. Eventually she begins dating Rafe (Biggs), gets a therapist (Heche), and becomes addicted to Prozac.

It's nothing you haven't really seen before. The movie is ultimately unsatisfying. I've never read the book, but I hope it was better than this. I'm giving this movie 4 stars, because while it wasn't satisfying...It wasn't bad. It was entertaining and Ricci does give a pretty good performance. The movie has some interesting theories and interesting dialogue; If it was derived from the book, it's obvious Wurtzel is a pretty good writer. The movie is fairly interesting to an extent, but...Well, I don't know. Don't say I didn't warn you.

GRADE: B-

P.S.,

To answer the obvious question. Yes, there is a nude scene with Christina Ricci. Keeping in mind, it's a nude scene. NOT a sex scene.",1151884800,5,1992,5.036474164133739
2265845,5,B00094ASC2,"First of all, Christina Ricci is gorgeous as always.  Sure, that may not be very useful to the female audience, but it is also her superb acting that carries this tremendous film.  I am shocked that it has never seen the screen of a movie theatre...Hollywood bastards.

I will admit, I have not read the book yet, so I'm probably not as spoiled, but even if I did, I would love this movie.  This movie that even Jason Biggs cannot sink.

Christina Ricci's excellent vocal skills for the obsessive narration give the movie an exciting fast paced feel.  Biggs surprisingly does a good job playing the false sense of normalcy to help illustrate the selfishness of the protagonist.  Though there was a review that explains that she has no signs of clinical depression, I really couldn't find myself carring about that with the outstanding acting.  Sure, Ricci's character is almost whiny, but I don't feel like it's whiny.  I feel like she is taking me through her journey in her mind.  Besides, what is clinically depressed?  There are plenty of people who are diagnosed with depression and given drugs for no real good reason other than their testimony on how much they fear life.  This really is a prozac nation we live in.",1151452800,5,1222,4.685446009389671

2265857,3,B00094ASC2,"The first time I saw this film, I was depressed by it (I thought I needed Prozac by the time it was over), but the second time I thought it was one of the funniest movies ever made.

For example, there's Jessica Lange's over the top performance as Liz's mother. The scene where she's screaming at her ex-husband over the phone, smashing everything, is pure Faye Dunaway doing Mommie Dearest. It is so overdone you find yourself laughing.

Then, there's the drunk scene, where Christina Ricci is totally bombed and freaks out her grandparents when they come over for her birthday party. The grandparents are horrified, while her mother keeps telling them she's fine. Hilarious!

Also, the scene in which Ricci forces her boyfriend, Jason Biggs, to introduce her to his family, could be a skit from Saturday Night Live. It turns out he has a mentally disabled sister who is either retarded or has some sort of syndrome. When they eat at the dinner table, the look on Ricci's face is priceless. The girl throws tantrums like Ricci, only she's retarded and later Ricci accuses Biggs that's why he's attracted to her, because she's as messed up as his sister!!

Also, Anne Heche is terrible as the psychiatrist. She has such a self-satisfied smirk you want to slap her. She looks like she'd rather be playing tennis than listening to her agonized patient. Who would want her for a shrink?

I predict this will be a camp classic, like Mommie Dearest, within the decade. ""Prozac Nation"" is one of the worst but funniest films ever.",1146700800,4,1524,4.714285714285714

However, like the book, the protagonist comes off whiny and not realistic.

There is no doubt from random snippets she gives that she is suffering from a clinical depression.

Perhaps, even the author is too scared to approach her real feelings, as depression is so much more than the arguments with her parents and the paranoia with a boyfriend.  Which is why I do think she comes off as whiny- her problems and depression do not seem unavoidable.

The movie is good for what it is, but I do not think it illustrates an actual experience with clinical depression very well.",1143676800,4,658,4.637931034482759

I was surprised to see how many critics panned the film, citing Ricci's character as too unlikeable and without redeeming qualities.  I can only surmise that this is a result of the illness and the film being wholly misunderstood.

Severe depression is difficult to understand from the outside looking in.  Depressive behavior often makes no sense to others and can be so damaging to all in its path.  Prozac Nation lets us see the illness from the perspective of the sufferer and view its destructive power first hand.  There is no hidden message or agenda to be found in the film.  It doesn't claim to have all the answers.  It doesn't pass too harsh a judgement on anyone in the story, but doesn't make excuses for them either.  What it seeks to do and accomplishes admirably, is allow us a glimpse into the mind of a depression sufferer.

However, it turned out to be very involving...a few of the scenes were indeed hard to watch (self-mutilation, severe emotional abuse, etc.) but overall Christina Ricci, Jessica Lange, Jason Biggs, and Anne Heche carry this film without breaking a sweat.

It was hard not liking Ricci's character even if she was a self-absorbed psychopath 90% of the time. I also found myself cringing at some of her more melodramatic writing and narrative.  But overall the sheer force of her charisma kept me watching and interested.  The fact that she can be extremely fetching at times (though fairly weird/psycho-looking at others) obviously did not hurt, of course.

The last 10 minutes were a little fuzzy, I couldn't quite figure out what happened and how it happened---but maybe a more typical happy-Hollywood-ending would've been very hard to swallow.  I'm sure much of the negative reaction this film has garnered is a result of the public's discomfort and/or denial of the side of life that this film portrays---highly educated and priviledged white female goes bonkers again and again with nary a white knight in the vicinity to come rescue her...whoops, that was the Julia Roberts / Jennifer Lopez vehicle wasn't it!

2265863,5,B00094ASC2,"Evidently based on a true story, 'Prozac Nation' documents the life of Elizabeth Wurtzel (played expertly by Christina Ricci), a young woman from a unstable broken family, earns a scholarship to Harvard for a journalism degree.  It's no surprise that Lizzie is depressed, her parents are each dysfunctional in their own right.  Lizzie's mother (skillfully played by Jessica Lange) worries that Lizzie will isolate herself in college.  Lizzie tries not to let her mother down, but depression is not a beast that is so easily tamed.

Isolation, substance abuse, withdrawing, avoiding conflict, staying up for days, brain-cycling (like a short circuit), not bathing, sudden outbursts of anger, fear of becoming close to others, subconscious attempts to prove oneself unworthy, obsessive-compulsive behavior, all are signs of clinical depression.  'Prozac Nation', with the expert performance of Christina Ricci, shows every inch of Lizzie's slide into deeper and deeper depression.

At one point, Lizzie says, ""How can I escape the demons in my head?""  As a person being successfully treated for clinical depression, this phrase alone literally struck home with me.  'Prozac Nation' is an all-out, no-holes-barred look at what it is like to suffer from this disorder.  The movie is very well done, and you will either find yourself identifying with Lizzie or hating her for being self-centered.

Thrown into the mix is the fact that Lizzie is a writer, and very few of the most talented writers would be considered 'normal' people.  Lizzie herself even uses a quote from Hemmingway's ""The Sun Also Rises"" and finds identity within it.  Good writers stay inside their own head too much, and Lizzie has talent in her work, winning the College Journalism Award for 1985.

During the course of coping with college, alienating her parents and her best friend, and eventually her boyfriend, Lizzie finds herself in therapy again with Dr. Sterling (played very well, surprisingly, by Anne Heche).  It isn't until many visits with Dr. Sterling and eventually a prescription for Prozac to help her ""gain some perspective and stop spinning out of control"".  At this point, I thought it was a little funny that Lizzie referred to her pharmacy as a ""legal crackhouse"".

I thought that this was a beautifully done movie about the realism of clinical depression.  Well filmed, well acted, well set, and with a great script, 'Prozac Nation' deserves much more recognition than it got.  I consider this movie a ""buy"".  Enjoy!",1136937600,63,2506,5.173697270471464

2265865,4,B00094ASC2,"It's silly to berate a movie that hasn't even come out. Having read the book, and been down the road of chronic depression for many months, I have to disagree with the first preview that claims this movie unworthy because of the image Wurtzel gives us of depression. Depression, sorry to burst Violetta's bubble, it a unique, personal hard fought battle for evey individual who suffers from it. That just happened to be Wurtzel's experience with her own depression. Needless to say I give the book my highest rating and hope to do the same with the movie. Prozac Nation was one of those movies I wanted to see as soon as I heard about it. I have seen the trailer a few times and couldn't wait for the film to be released into theaters. It was at first in limited release, which I don't understand why since it is a mainstream movie but anyway it finally arrived to my local theater today. So as soon as I could I rushed to the theater to see Prozac Nation.

The movie's plot is very simple but at the same time very complex, Lizzie played by the beautiful and talented Christina Ricci is a depressed girl. Following up his critically acclaimed debut Insomnia (1997), Norwegian director Erik Skjoldbjaerg makes his first English-language feature with this adaptation of the novel by Elizabeth Wurtzel. Christina Ricci stars as Lizzie, a prize-winning student heading off to Harvard where she intends to study journalism and launch a career as a rock music critic. However, Elizabeth's fractured family situation including an errant father (Nicholas Campbell) and a neurotic, bitterly hypercritical mother (Jessica Lange) has led to a struggle with depression. When her all-night, drug-fueled writing binges and emotional instability alienate her roommate and best friend, Ruby (Michelle Williams), as well as both her first (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and second (Jason Biggs) boyfriends, Lizzie seeks psychiatric counseling from Dr. Diana Sterling (Anne Heche), who prescribes the wonder drug Prozac. Despite success as a writer that includes a gig writing for Rolling Stone and some mellowing out thanks to her medication, Lizzie begins to feel that the pills are running her life and faces some tough choices about her future. Prozac Nation (2001) is a longtime dream project of star Ricci, who also serves as one of the film's co-producers. Prozac Nation then starts to develop into an unusual and original movie, which I for one have never seen before. A lot of symbolism, terrific acting, and a lot of dark past scenes ensue.

In this film I really could not believe the acting. It was terrific all around. Christina Ricci proves that she can hold a lead role and do it flawlessly. Her role was perfect and involved a lot of different emotions, which she played off like a natural. But Christina Ricci's acting isn't the highlight of this film, that award goes to Jessica Lange who plays her role like she actually was going though this in real life. Her incredible acting kept getting stronger throughout the entire film. The supporting actors and actresses were all good as well. Michelle Williams who played Ruby, was really good in her role. Emily Perkins who played Ellen was very good as well as Anne Heche who played the doctor Sterling.

The film's script was another strong point. It was very good! I never knew what was going to happen next. I thought I did a few times but I was wrong. The script also had a lot of symbolism in it and if you watch the movie closely you will be able to catch it. I also like how the movie didn't have the typical Hollywood ending at the end. It was very different and I didn't expect what happened to happen. The writer, Galt Niederhoffer did a great job and surprisingly this was his second film. I wish I could shake this man's hand for making such a great piece of cinema. I am really looking forward to his next movie Lonesome Jim that comes out in 2005. I loved the director's use of camera angles and the many views of various landscapes and the sky. It was very creative.

So what else can I say about the film, it was very independent like which I am sure will turn the normal moviegoers off right away. The movie moves slowly to build its story and suspense. It does this flawlessly. It's really amazing. If you want a great movie that has an unusual and original story, great acting and lots of hidden messages and symbolism then go see Prozac Nation and enjoy. If you don't like movies that make you think then skip this one because it's not for you. It was a terrific film from a great new director. I've been looking forward to seeing Prozac Nation since I first saw the poster for the film. The poster itself seemed rather amusing and then when I had seen the trailer for the film and wanted to watch the film even more. I usually enjoy Christina Ricci on the big screen. She is definitely a great actress. Lots of clever dialog, great acting, and a unique story ensue.

The acting in the film was top notch. I think Christina Ricci's performance was very noteworthy. I liked her character. Lizzie was nice girl who was very sweet and innocent. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers performance was another great role for his resume. I liked how his character had many sides to him. I felt they all played their characters well.

I think what is amazing about the script is the fact that a. the writer never wrote a film anything like it before and b. it's a very original film. I know I haven't seen every movie but I never seen a movie like this. The story was unique, the characters were likable, and the dialog was rather clever. I applaud these two screenwriters for their effort on the script. Sadly I doubt the movie will do well. There was only three people in the theater counting me and the story is rather odd and original so I don't know if it will really trigger much interest from the typical moviegoers.

Erik Skjoldbjrg was the director of Prozac Nation. I have not seen his movies Insomnia yet but I'll watch it as soon as I can get my paws on it. I liked how in the film, Erik Skjoldbjrg really captured being in Harvard and being depressed, showing everyone in the opening scene of the film. It really lets you know how life is for Lizzie. The director also did a good job of directing the actors and making them connect. I really felt for the characters in this film. I liked that they had this great connection with each other on screen.

So to summarize, I overall really enjoyed Prozac Nation. The cast is great, as is its story. I feel the film won't attract much attention since the crap fest wholesome teen movies and sex comedies rule the box office, it's an indie film and the fact that Prozac Nation itself isn't aimed at the average moviegoer crowd. I recommend this film though to anyone who wants to see a film that is smart, original and witty. It delivers great performances and some sad moments. I really enjoyed the film and will probably go see it again if I can.",1136332800,13,6941,4.596448748991122
2265866,4,B00094ASC2,"As I was renting this DVD at the store, I was told by the clerk that this film was just crap, and that he just wished that Christina Ricci's character just kill herself. I rented it anyways, because I wanted to see Jessica Lange. I am aware that this film had been made more than two years ago, and finally went straight to video. What a drag? That didn't stop me from enjoying this film, and just the same reason I was so sympathetic towards depressed characters like last years Kim Basinger in The Door In The Floor. This film certainly devides the audiences into two sides. One will understand and appreciate the importance of the mental health issues dealt with in this film, and the others will reject and hate this film because they can't relate to what it's like to be in Elizabeth's shoes. The bottom line is that being depressed is hard enough, and sometimes beyond the theapy sessions, the anti-depressants have to be the final treatment, despite the lack of acceptance by non-depressed folks.

Yes, I can relate to Christina Ricci's situation. Her self-centered and irresponsible father(Nicolas Campbell) abandoned her at teenage, leaving in the custody of her neurotic and controlling mother(Lange). She's a talented and aspiring journalist/music critic. Her mother gave her all to make sure she gets into Harvard, but things turned ugly when her friendship and relationships goes into chaos, and she gradually falls into a deep state of depression. Sadly, her mother doesn't understand why she can't ""get over it"" and stop being self-destructive. She is sent to many theapy sessions with Dr. Sterling(a subtle and confident Anne Heche), but she still had to go on Prozac for good, at least until she's back to herself again....

Jessica Lange and Christina Ricci had numerous heavy duty emotional fight scenes together, and they were equally powerful and mesmerizing. Michelle Williams and Jason Biggs had some strong moments to work with as Ricci's best friend and love interest. Overall, this film has TV movie of the week feel and it's weakness is on the direction and editing mostly. The cast is much more worthwhile.",1133308800,9,2134,4.925

Whatever your reaction may be, it is hard for anyone to rationalize the complicated psychological aspects of humans' behaviors, and the film also shows that difficulity.""

The film does a good job at showing how wrong human behavior can go and how tough it is for parents and friends to reach out to someone who is truly disturbed, and even Harvard cannot save some from their own self destructive urges.  There is some very good acting going on in this film.",1130976000,7,655,4.778761061946903

It is a tough subject and I don't really know if you can accurately depict true mental depression in a film: a book can spend a lot of time getting under your skin and into your head; this film only runs approx. 91 minutes.

My initial feelings were that it is, from someone who has never taken any anti-depression drugs (because I refused to when it was recommended to do otherwise), an honest film; perhaps as close to reality as a movie on this subject can get. ""Prozac Nation"" did a damn good job in my humble opinion and it was without the typical cliches` and acted by everyone extremely well, especially Christina Ricci and Jessica Lange. Recommended to anyone who wants to get closer to a true-life story on this subject.

Also thought that those reviewers who discarded the film, suggesting the character just ""get over it"" were a bit harsh.

A depressed person is often unreasoning. So how can it possibly accept ""get over it"" as an answer?",1130976000,10,1024,4.554347826086956

2265902,5,B00094ASC2,"Aside from the starting scene with a completely naked Christina Ricci, it may well be one of my all-time favorite movies.  Though, I am sure, my reasons for that may be the same reasons many people will not understand the movie at all.  Let me give you a quick spill on what the movie is about.

It is based on the by Elizabeth Wurtzel, the true story of a girl (Lizzie) in the 80's who goes on Prozac.  She is depressed.  The movie shows her experiences at college as she spirals to the point of being put on Prozac.

Now, why did I like this movie so much?  There are a couple of reasons.  One was the camera angles.  I am not usually one who even notices that stuff, but there were some really interesting shots in this movie.  It gave another dimension to the story.  Second, the lines.  There were some amazing lines about depression.  One that I remember was, ""One moring you wake up and realize you're afraid you might live.""  Repeat that to yourself.  Think about it.  If you have ever been in a clinical state of depression, you understand that statement.  It feels real on your tongue, familiar in your mouth.  You may have even said it.

The main reason that I liked this movie had nothing to do with anything artistic.  I loved and hated Lizzie all at one time, because I could see myself in her.  Granted, I skipped out on drugs, alcohol, and smoking.  I was never one to sling my anger to the outside, as she did.  At least, not as often.  But the things she was feeling.  How she would do things she didn't want to do and couldn't understand how they were happening, why she was needing to do them... I have been there.  In one scene, where she is arguing with her mother, yelling, screaming, bouncing violently between begging forgiveness and spewing hatred, it was like looking in a mirror.  The way she held her head as she cried.  You could see the tension in her arms.  She wanted to run, to hit and throw.  It wouldn't have surprised me if she had turned and banged her head into the nearest wall.

Her actions were not strange to me.

After one line, my husband turned to me and said, ""Is that how you feel?""  And I had to nod.  The line... Lizzie was sitting at a table, waiting on the next guy she would throw herself at, the one she had chosen to be her salvation, and you can hear her thoughts.  In her head, she says, ""Don't let him know how crazy you are.""  They didn't have to tell me that is what she was thinking though.  I already knew.

I don't know how I feel about that, so I am not going to write anymore about this movie right now.  Suffice it to say that it was well done.",1128988800,39,2610,4.227642276422764
2265903,5,B00094ASC2,"Most critics of the film are not repulsed by the acting or directing, by Ricci's character Lizzie. It is easy to understand why; Lizzie is often self-centered, possessive, and hurts the ones she loves. But since when any of us were perfect? In many books and films, the young heroines usually learn that by being good and 'doing the right thing' everything will surely result in growing up, with a happy ending. And here is Lizzie, who falls into depression 'gradually then suddenly'; with divorced parents who are constantly in a tug-of-war, with Lizzie in the middle. She begins a journalism career at Harvard, and it seems as though she will finally have a happier new start. But of course, it doesn't turn out that way. She falls into drugs and bad relationships. Depression catches up with Lizzie, and it starts to gnaw at her life. Depression can affect anyone; even if you are the most fortunate person in the world you can get up in the morning, afraid to live. And Lizzie's life wasn't so easy either. She often explodes at her friends and her family, sometimes with good reason and often just based on a whim. The remarkable thing about Ricci's acting is that throughout the film we can see everything from Lizzie's point of view, and understand what she is going through. Many of us can identify with her. Elizabeth Wurtzel perfectly describes how depression feels like, like a cancer that invades every part of the body, or like having no soul/spirit at all. You feel sorry for Elizabeth in the movie, because everything seems so frustrating and spinning out of control. Yes, she screams and has ""tantrums""; I have read many criticisms on the movie because of that. But she is still young, and I can't find a person who didn't feel like screaming at least once during their teens, even without depression. She seems juvenile and self- centered, which of course she is. She comes to abrupt, obscure conclusions without properly rationalizing. I must repeat: Lizzie is not the heroine that rules the movies with flawless love and kindness to others. She is not Amelie. And I love Lizzie because she is so human.

This is why I like this film, though not all may. If you are into flawless young heroines who will always have a happy ending, this movie may not be for you. But for everyone else, this is.",1127520000,8,2312,4.680589680589681
2265904,5,B00094ASC2,"Fine performances from an excellent cast (Christina Ricci and two-time Oscar winner Jessica Lange), as well as an extremely well-written (and sublimely subtle) screenplay, make PROZAC NATION underrated--and nearly a masterpiece!  The film is not incredibly fast-moving, but it is thoughtful and sensitive, as is Lizzie (the main character). As her boyfriend says at a point in the film, everything she feels is felt deep down inside of her.

 Things happen to her that happen to many teenage girls, but to her they cut deeper--are more hurtful. It is this sensitivity that makes Lizzie prone to depression.  Some of the experiences she encounters at college--the brutal drinking and drugs scene (which anyone who has been a college student is probably aware of) as well as the random, loveless hookups--get the best of her and she finds herself spiraling out of control.

She dreams of being a writer, but how can she write when the world around her is so careless and hurtful?  The same boy who hooks up with her and leads her into a dangerous drug addiction also denies being her friend once she has given up drugs (for her health).  After making love to her, he said that drugs and sex were both on the same meaningless level to him. When she reacts by objectifying the sex they had and considering it meaningless, he is angered!  This represents a double standard, highlighted in the film--although men can objectify sex, when a woman does the same thing she is looked badly upon (Lizzie, actually, was waiting to lose her virginity by someone who loved her, but he surely did not).

  It is all of these experiences, combined with the loss of her dad four years before and the stresses of college and writing that send Lizzie into depression--and it is a depression easily understood, for it is partly society-based.  What does it say about our society that doctors need to issue over 300 million prozac prescriptions in a year?  Are we solving society's problems or just glossing over the natural, emotional reactions of an individual living under a flawed system?  How can we fix the deeper problem by glossing over the issue with Prozac?  As Lizzie says, ""this is not the real me."" It is the drug, and we are living in a prozac nation.  These are the questions brought up by the very intelligent and moving film, PROZAC NATION.

Perhaps the controversy outweighs the high quality and explains why this film so low-rated.  Surely, the mindless and unsubtle ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" did not deserve a higher rating, but of course exorcisms are not nearly as controversial as the problems of Prozac and the society that needs it--because exorcisms are not a real threat.

When films are made about real threats to our society, they are ignored, banned, or badly reviewed.  Remember that Prozac Nation did not make it to theaters.",1127260800,7,2838,4.824380165289257
2265905,2,B00094ASC2,"The long delayed adaptation of Elizabeth Wurtzel's novel, Prozac Nation is a supreme disappointment.  Christina Ricci stars as Lizzie, a depressed teen who begins her first semester at Harvard, and it isn't long before she alienates herself and those around her: ranging from her roomate (Michelle Williams), prospective boyfriends (Jonathan Rhys-Myers, Jason Biggs), and even her doting but ill-advised mother (Jessica Lange).  I've never read Wurtzel's book, but my girlfriend has, and she claims that the film surpasses much of what is featured in the book.  Whether this is the case or not, the viewer is left feeling ""what is the point of all this?"".  There's no easy solution met by the time the credits roll, and what Wurtzel is trying to say gets lost in the haze.  Ricci and Lange give great performances, but they can't save the film.  With everything that went into making Prozac Nation (from Ricci serving as a co-producer to the directing by Erik Skjoldbjrg, who directed the original Insomnia) it's a shame that it's as disappointing as it is.",1125532800,6,1057,5.011428571428572
2265906,3,B00094ASC2,"I first read Elizabeth Wurtzel's memoir ""Prozac Nation"" when I was in college and I was transfixed.  The force of Wurtzel's personality and the passion in which she wrote honestly jumped off the page as she described her fight with depression and how she acted out and ultimately how Prozac helped her regain control of herself.  Since Wurtzel grew up in the 80's, Prozac was not yet the common medication that it currently is, and was only just beginning to be described.  I believe I first saw a preview for the film version of ""Prozac Nation"" when I was in college and I do know that I've been looking for a release of the movie for at least four years now.  The film never caught a theatrical release, was only recently shunted off to a cable premiere, and is now out on DVD.  Honestly, what took so long?

Elizabeth (Christina Ricci) is about to enroll at Harvard University as a freshman.  She has a journalism scholarship.  From the start it is clear that she is somewhat depressed and that she doesn't seem to fit in with the crowds.  She says as much during her opening narration.  It is also quite clear that her mother (Jessica Lange) is somewhat nuts and certainly oblivious to her daughter's pain.  Perhaps it is not that her mother is oblivious, but is purposefully trying to ignore the issue in the hopes that it is suddenly ""all better"" and that it'll go away.  Elizabeth finds solace in her friendship with her new roommate Ruby (Michelle Williams) as the initially seem to be a perfect fit.  She even meets a guy (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) whom she falls for.

Everything seems to be perfect, but considering the source material, the title ""Prozac Nation"", and that there wouldn't be much of a movie if nothing went wrong, something has to change.  What changes is that Elizabeth is unable to deal with the pressures of life.  The stress of school, her journalism, her relationship, her friendship, her mother, her father, and everything else seems to crash down upon her and Elizabeth more than anyone else starts to unconsciously and unthinkingly sabotage herself.

""Prozac Nation"" never did receive very much critical acclaim, so this isn't a story about the little movie that could.  The reviews have been mostly negative, scoring a 29% positive on the Tomatometer (at the time of this review).  ""Prozac Nation"" isn't that bad.  It lacks the searing performance of Angelina Jolie in ""Girl, Interrupted"", but it isn't that kind of movie.  Ricci is given something to work with in this movie and does a good job with the role of Elizabeth Wurtzel.  She seems to nail the depression and alienation quite well, though I think the screenwriter didn't quite round the character off as well making Elizabeth a little shrill and not quite as sympathetic as she could have been.  Then again, maybe that really is Wurtzel.  The best performance of the film, however, goes to Michelle Williams, as Ruby.  Ruby is entirely human and warm and believable as a friend and roommate who becomes frustrated by Elizabeth.  It's been several years since she played this role, but I hope it helps to find Williams some quality parts.  This film is directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg (the original ""Insomnia"", not the American remake).

This isn't the best film you will run across, but it is far from the worst and I found myself enjoying the performances of Christina Ricci, Michelle Williams, and even Jason Biggs (yes, he's in it, too).  Biggs is very restrained here and far from his ""American Pie"" days.  If the story itself sounds interesting or Christina Ricci is an actress you would like to see more of, then this is worth seeing.

2265929,1,B00094ASC2,"I am certain Elizabeth Wurtzel's painful cinematic journey through drug abuse and depression, played by Christina Ricci, was SUPPOSED to make the viewer feel compassion and sympathy.

Unfortunately I could barely contend with Lizzie's character.  Whether shrieking nonsense at her much-put-upon boyfriend Noah, betraying her best friend and roommate Ruby, or heaping insult upon injury to her martyr-mother Mrs. Wurtzel, one wishes only that the self-obsessed LIZ would find herself with her jaw wired shut and spare the world her mouth.

Particularly irritating was the fact that she blames, in part, the breakup of her parents' marriage as well as the drug-friendly zeitgeist of the 1980s on her ""issues"".  While being deeply depressed certainly isn't her fault, Lizzie really refuses to actually WORK with her therapist, Dr. Stirling, to make any mental health progress.  Instead she's content to wallow in self-pity, wade through waves of cocaine, prozac, uppers, downers, and alcohol, and rage in futility against everyone in her life's inability to make her whole.  She's ridiculous.

And poor Noah.  The man tries and tries -- he gently advises Lizzie not to venture to Texas to see him over their winter holiday (both are students at Harvard), only to have her descend like an avenging fury.  She sees his reason why she shouldn't have come -- he helps his mother tend to his sister, who has a severely crippling degenerative condition.  And when Lizzie witnesses this, her reaction is classic -- she accuses Noah of having a ""savior complex"" and that he ""GETS OFF ON THIS [kind of] STUFF"".

Whaaaaaaaaaa....?!?!  Thank goodness Noah loses complete interest in her soon thereafter.

Unless one desires to be subjected to hours of horrible screaming, temper tantrums, and other nightmarish, juvenile antics, do not bother with ""Prozac Nation"".",1123113600,16,1850,5.2517006802721085
2265930,4,B00094ASC2,"Lizzie is unquestionably appealing, she is articulate, perceptive, and intelligent.  She is also shackled by depression.  It makes her behave very badly. It makes her wound the ones who love her.  Her depression translates into fear--she is afraid she won't please others enough, she is afraid she won't make the grade, she is afraid she's not sexy enough.  She is afraid someone might love her.

Christina Ricci perfectly embodies the tortured soul at war with itself.  She fights her way to Harvard, she fights her way to alienation, she fights her way to therapy.  And saddest of all, when she finally responds to therapy, she declares, ""This isn't me.  The real me is totally f***ked up.""  She knows nothing else.

Lizzie's mother is sympathetic, incredulous, and exhausted; she chain-smokes and wonders where the hell she went wrong.  Lizzie's father is estranged and uninterested.  Lizzie's grandparents are speechless.

2265935,4,B00094ASC2,"The best-selling autobiographical novel Prozac Nation by Elizabeth Wurtzel receives a loose adaptation in Erik Skjoldbjrg's version of her handling her own clinical depression.  Since the book is autobiographical one must mention the book in comparison to the film, which is very unlike the novel.  Wurtzel's written version is much darker and more gruesome in its depiction of her depression where she repeatedly tries to commit suicide and has a constant lingering of overwhelming helplessness hanging over her.  The film uses a different approach on depression, as Skjoldbjrg's version is much more subdued in a way that maybe most people could relate to.  Thus, the film does not offer the true story of Elizabeth Wurtzel's struggles, but a tale that maybe could help others to understand.

Erik Skjoldbjrg knows how to capture an apprehensive and uneasy atmosphere, which he does brilliantly in his original Norwegian version of Insomnia (1997).  In the film Prozac Nation he introduces the audience to Elizabeth (Christina Ricci) and her dysfunctional family that constantly tears her apart emotionally with their own needs while never considering what their daughter and granddaughter truly need.  Guilt, verbal abuse, and emotional neglect are the daily ordain for Elizabeth around her kin, as she finds a way to relieve herself of her own demons through writing.  Her way to deal is by scribbling down letters, letters to words, words to sentences, sentences to paragraphs, and eventually to complete works.  This becomes her way of dealing with stress, issues, and other predicaments.  In a sense, it becomes her very way of living, as she finds herself publishing her first work in Seventeen Magazine.

Elizabeth receives a journalism scholarship to Harvard University where she for the first time gets to bring some distance between her and her mother, Sarah (Jessica Lange), who has been overwhelmingly involved in Elizabeth's life.  It becomes a time of many firsts for her, as she discovers a new side of her that did not exist in high school.  She becomes very involved in writing for the university paper, The Crimson, that opens her doors to the Rolling Stones magazine where she has been asked to write a piece.  However, it becomes a devastating experience for her, as she finds herself lost with unfamiliar emotion that pulls her into a downward spiraling turmoil causing writers block, insomnia, and poor hygiene that also affect her health.  She faces the psychological demon called depression.

The chemistry between the parents suggests a troubling upbringing, but also the source of Elizabeth's anxiousness and helpless mindset.  Yet, nothing in the film is definite, and this is important, as there are no one single sources or solutions for clinical depression.  Instead Skjoldbjrg cleverly mixes several complex issues into one organic mix where Elizabeth's persona emerges shaken, lost, and helpless.  Her everyday decisions become shadowed by her own negative view of herself, which she projects onto those around her in a constant need to feel good, but never achieves.  The smallest issues turns into gigantic ordeals causing much pain to her and everyone around her as people slowly begin to drift away from her self-destructive persona.  It is a tragic, disturbing, and painful experience to see all the self-loathing that she illustrates through her thoughts and interactions with people.

Prozac Nation will definitely not cheer anyone up, as this cinematic experience will certainly turn into a downer.  The pessimistic and gloomy story of Elizabeth offers an intriguing story that maybe could help some to open their eyes to how some people feel or experience depression.  This is in consideration of a certain movie star's recent arrogant out-lash in media against depression, psychiatry, and psychology as pseudoscience illustrates that there still is ignorance among people in regards to clinical depression.  Nonetheless, Prozac Nation offers one detailed and multifaceted perspective on life in one of its darkest moments, which is very real to those who have suffered from clinical depression.",1120348800,7,4138,5.309815950920245
2265936,5,B00094ASC2,"I've read the book, and seen the foreign version (persumably the same version) of the movie, and it is well worth viewing.

For those who have read Prozac Nation, I don't think you'll be disappointed, although some reader's have.  If you're a fan of Elizabeth Wurtzel, you may find her on screen portrayal to be too bitchy and 'evil', (it was rumored that was a reason why it had taken so long to be released in the US).  But, if you've read and understood her character in the book, I'm sure you'll understand and accept her movie character as well.  Even if you don't usually enjoy the movies more than the book, it's certainly still worth seeing, and I think no one could have done a better job of playing Elizabeth Wurtzel than Christina Ricci.

She gives a very believable performance of a talented young woman with severe depression and Fear of Rejection issues related to the loss of her father when she was a young child.  I especially enjoyed watching her constantly push her friends and lovers away to test their loyalty because she is terrified of losing them.  Logically, she knows these actions are self-destructive and actually cause her friends to abandon her, but her feelings and emotions (especially fear) are deeply rooted and extremely difficult to control.

Ricci's mother is also terrific.  A complicated character, she is flawed, but not to the point of overshadowing her redeeming qualities.  She could have been played simply as a one dimensional antagonist, trying to live her failed life through her daughter.  but she is much more complicated than that.

Ricci's father came across as pretty much of an ass, with maybe some mental issues of his own.  A weak character, but since the movie is based on a true story, maybe the father was nothing more than that in real life?

The movie somehow managed to avoid a typical hollywood feel-good type ending.  Very realistic, and the film is better for it.
