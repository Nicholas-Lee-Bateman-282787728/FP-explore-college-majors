8659272,3,B00KIM2SL4,"Having just re-watched seasons one and two, we dived into this season expecting, to some extent, more of the same; the same gritty realism, the same odious ex-Infernal Repairs Vogel, the same inter-departmental politics, the same dingy, rundown outskirts of Paris. While this season delivered on some of these expectations, it sorely lacks the previous seasons plausibility and labyrinthine plot.

The action continues immediately following the explosive finale of season two. Theo is fighting for his life and the team, especially Roxanne, are out for revenge. A real case gets in the way, providing the season with a second narrative but it is really a bit of a tired old clich; yep, feuding Eastern European gangsters again. Caplan and chums are joined by a Georgian policeman to investigate a trafficking ring which conveniently coincides with the plot of Vogel and his new sidekick to bring down Caplan, Rox and Walter. The whole thing spirals out of control, of course, but with almost no senior police involvement or oversight the overall feeling is of an action movie rather an intense, plausible police based drama.

 In previous seasons, Caplan continually tried to do the right thing while lurching from one catastrophe to another, but this time it is all rather silly. Considering that this season is written by the chap responsible for season two and the splendidly nasty Mesrine and thoroughly unpleasant A Prophet under the watchful eye of Oliver Marchal, I don't think it unreasonable to have expected something better. Season three, sadly, fails to meet the standard of the earlier ones; lets hope that in season four, due for release in Spring 2016 we see a return to form with proper intricate plotting and alarming realism. In the meantime, thank goodness for Spiral. On a minor technical note, the soundtrack is only in stereo rather than Dolby 5.1.",1423958400,3,1870,5.064935064935065
8659273,5,B00KIM2SL4,This is just as good as if not better than the first two series. I'm glad I bought it.,1422144000,,86,3.5789473684210527
8659274,4,B00KIM2SL4,"Braquo is often called France's answer to The Wire, it is not. It is France's answer to The Shield as both are about a maverick group of cops prepared to break the rules and the law to get things done. The difference is that in the Shield Vic and his boys break the law for personnel gain. In Braquo Eddie, Wally, Theo and Rox break the law to get the bad guys or to protect themselves from gangsters or rival police. Series 3 has two plot lines a war is breaking out between various groups of  Russian and Armenian mobs and a young women is plotting revenge against Caplan for past events. Expect lots of gunfights, car chases and general mayhem. One thing though does Franch not have any French criminals or are they all Arabs, Turks or Eastern Europeans?. Good but for the best French cop show try Spiral.",1413417600,,808,4.386666666666667
