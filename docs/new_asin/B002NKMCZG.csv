8375114,5,B002NKMCZG,"well, as the creator of this fine documentary film, I must be humble,though it is quite difficult to be so. Particular highlights in the film that make it worthwhile are footage of Ron Kovich trying to get in to the Rolling stone party exclaiming he has been invited by President jimmy carter and additional insight from jeff carter. Also, the ""real"" ufo footage is quite something. Als, jimmy's alien abduction which leaves him with a suspicious scar is quite a treat. The real rabbit attack photo makes this documentary one of the finest DVD's to come along in a great while or at least in the last couple of minutes. Look for the director's cut in the near future though you won't find one. In any case, I highly recommend this ,it makes a great stocking stuffer and will be sure to collect dust in your dvd collection after a viewing or so!!!",1251849600,,846,4.5359477124183005
