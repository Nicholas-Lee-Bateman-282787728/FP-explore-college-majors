Murder-She-Wrote fans, Father Dowling fans, Simon and Simon fans and Matlock fans really need to get the complete set of Diagnosis Murder series and have yourself a great feast for the kind of mysteries that make you feel good.",1381795200,,417,5.043478260869565

5915171,5,B00EI3XCIM,"I have been waiting for the additional series of Diagnosis Murder to be issued.  As soon as I saw them at Amazon.com, I ordered them.  Now I'm waiting for the rest of the seasons so I have the complete set.  I enjoyed these when they were on TV, and now I can enjoy them on DVD.  Thank you",1381536000,,289,3.9310344827586206
5915172,1,B00EI3XCIM,Just be aware if you are seeking the famous scene where Doctor Sloan (Dick Van Dyke) walks past a radio station studio and sees Rob Petrie (Dick Van Dyke) - the scene has been cut from this DVD. They didn't even include it as an extra. Unbelievable!!,1393545600,,250,4.340425531914893

5915180,5,B00EI3XCIM,"Same excellence as the other seasons---back when television was wholesome, and you didn't have to worry about the kids watching the program.  No unnecessary violence, degrading language, and gratuitous sex just to try to appeal to prurient interests of some viewers. ""Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio....""",1382832000,,305,5.48936170212766
5915181,5,B00EI3XCIM,"season 5 is packed with stars that we all know, because we watched their shows. SEASON 5 has only 1 thing wrong with it, and that is the last show of the season. IT has part 1, then part 2, then to be continued. which means WE have to buy season 6 to find out WHO is destroying the city, WHY are they doing this ? AND even the hospital gets bombed !!!!!  I WANT SEASON 6 to get closer to finishing the series AND to find out WHO & WHY. the show is called OBSESSION.",1382486400,,465,3.84375
8605511,3,B00EI3XCIM,"Diagnosis Murder season five part two goes to the dark side as Dr. Sloan (Dick Van Dyke) is sentenced to prisonin a two part pilot for Fred Dryer (Police Chief Masters).  This was a spinoff series that never happened.  This was also a season when gimmick casting was overused (the cast of both versions of M*A*S*H, Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley, plus various other celebrities now has-beens).  They also dropped all pretense of being a mystery series so Dr. Sloan could rant and rail against HMOs, requiring no murders to be solved.  And, resorting to the fashion of the day, they ended the season with a two part cliffhanger that was ultimately dragged over four episodes, well into the next season.

At times, things got a bit more melodramatic and less fun.  Still, it remained entertainingexcept for those episodes when it wasnt.",1512000000,,837,4.818181818181818
