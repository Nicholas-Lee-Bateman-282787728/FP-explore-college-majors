8409670,4,B003YMI58A,"This is one of Formby's best films, and runs at a fast pace. It's nice to finally see some of his films being released here in the US. This one seems to be a transfer from a PAL Region 2 DVD that was struck from a 35mm print. It's a sharp print, but the opening scene is a bit on the dark side. All in all ""It Turned Out Nice Again"".",1339372800,3,333,3.704225352112676
8409671,2,B003YMI58A,"The films of the singer/comedian George Formby, the Lancashire lad who was a very big star in the UK in the thirties and forties, will probably not appeal to American audiences. Formby, possibly the male equivalent of Gracie Fields, played the working class hero, gauche and innocent, who had no pretensions above his station. Usually his films followed a formula whereby he overcame some challenge and won the heart of the girl. The attractions are that Formby was a first class technician in spite of his ""dumb"" demeanor, many of the films are nicely put together and when he picks up his ukele and sings, his charm is obvious.

When Britain entered the war, all the working class comedians, which were the staple of the British film industry to that time, took on the Nazis. In ""Let George do it"", Formby plays a member of the performing Dinky Doos and on his way to a gig in Blackpool. He is mistaken for a British Spy and ends up in Norway, caught up in Axis intrigue. The plot involves the sabotage of the U-boats which were sinking the British shipping at the time, so it was very topical. While a smash hit in its day, a morale booster when it was most needed, today we are left with a corny plot and some poor acting by the supporting cast, particularly Phyllis Calvert as the heroine. The pluses are that there are some excellent musical numbers which perfectly capture Formby's appeal, especially when all the extras join in for a sing-a-long.

The DVD print is only OK and there are no extras.",1284854400,2,1505,4.57037037037037
