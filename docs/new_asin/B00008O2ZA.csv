The dialogue isn't much, but Zero makes up for it with his wild gestures, inspired vocalizations and elastic facial expressions.  It's a truly a case of an actor being so brilliant he could actually read from the telephone book and make it artful and hilarious.  I wish Zero had performed the Yellow Pages rather than this script.",1305676800,2,503,4.670454545454546
7986081,5,B00008O2ZA,"These three short, low budget films are in the manner of Woody Allen, in that they re quite funny, even witty, and make use of name-brand actors between paying gigs, ie Mr. Kaufman gets them on the cheap. They concern very soft-core, perhaps far fetched fantasy stories about love relationships, using the producer's best Yale taught French: A ""melange-a-trois""..

The list of stars is surprisingly long. Must have been real lean times in the 1970's when they were made because the actors include Zero Mostel, Estelle Parsons, Jerry Orbach, and Pat Paulsen.

I found Paulsen's deadpan role flat-out hilarious, and was mesmerized if not totally captivated by the fetching, lithe actress Deborah Loomis seen in all her glory as the full size Polish Doll. I got a copy for my most hip friend and he liked it. Funnier than it really should be, Kaufman made it when he was maybe 5-10 years out of Yale. You can read of his diverse accomplishments on Wikipedia. He is the CEO of Troma, which brought us the Toxic Avenger and numerous other cult characters. Lloyd is Yale's answer to Mel Brooks, though I'm not sure what the question is or was. Enjoy!",1263081600,6,1144,4.743718592964824
