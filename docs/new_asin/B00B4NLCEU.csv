5555758,3,B00B4NLCEU,"It's a nice set of movies, not a bad one in the bunch. But as a previous reviewer noted, the packaging is terrible. Many of the disks have scratches; how could it be otherwise when they're not protected? Even paper sleeves would have been better than this. So, watch out. You'll want to watch these movies, but whether they're in good enough condition for you to be able to enjoy them -- well, that's far from certain!",1410566400,31,418,4.441558441558442

5555762,3,B00B4NLCEU,I love Cary Grant and my son just gifted me with this collection.  It was shipped in an envelope! (Gee thanks Anchor Media) The six discs inside two card stock folders were loose.  The sleeve holding the folders together was crushed.  i have not played any of the DVDs yet so I pray they have not been damaged.  I understand the concept of saving money but come on Amazon.  This was a disappointment.,1395705600,40,400,4.424657534246576
5555763,5,B00B4NLCEU,"This is a pretty good Cary Grant collection with a few of his best with Fox. As noted in past Fox box-sets there design is not the best and sometimes the packaging gets torn and the disks may or will have scratches, but I have bought seven of their collections and I haven't had any problems with them. This collection has two sleeves with three films on Vol 1 and three on Vol 2.

The details of the films included as in aspect ratio, runtime, color/b&w, etc. are as followed.

Volume 1
""Born to be Bad"" (1934/b&w/Full screen/62mins)
-Loretta Young, Grant, Jackie Kelk, Marion Burns, Henry Travers; Directed by Lowell Sherman
""I Was a Male War Bride"" (1949/b&w/Full screen/105mins)
-Grant, Ann Sheridan, Marion Marshall, Randy Stuart; Directed by Howard Hawks
""People Will Talk"" (1951/b&w/Full screen/110mins)
-Grant, Jeanne Crain, Finlay Currie, Hume Cronyn, Walter Slezak, Sidney Blackmer; Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz

Volume 2
""Monkey Business"" (1952/b&w/Full screen/97mins)
-Grant, Ginger Rogers, Charles Coburn, Marilyn Monroe, Hugh Marlowe; Directed by Howard Hawks
""An Affair Remember"" (1957/color/Widescreen/119mins)
-Grant, Deborah Kerr, Richard Denning; Directed by Leo McCarey
""Kiss Them For Me"" (1957/color/Widescreen/
-Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Leif Erickson, Suzy Parker, Ray Walston; Directed by Stanley Donen

Overall this is a pretty good collection with a few great Cary Grant films and is a collection I would recommend.",1376524800,39,1443,5.486486486486487
5555764,3,B00B4NLCEU,"Films featured in this 6-disc Cary Grant/Fox set are:

'Born to Be Bad' (1934) - drama with Loretta Young (2-plus stars)
'I Was a Male War Bride' (1949) - comedy with Ann Sheridan, directed by Howard Hawks (3 stars)
'People Will Talk' (1951) - drama with Jeanne Crain, directed by Joseph Mankiewicz (4 stars)
'Monkey Business' (1952) - comedy with Ginger Rogers, directed by Howard Hawks (3 stars)
'An Affair to Remember' (1957) - drama with Deborah Kerr, directed by Leo McCarey (4 stars)
'Kiss Them For Me' (1957) - comedy with Jayne Mansfield, directed by Stanley Donen (2 stars)

I consider Grant one of the giants (among Bogart, Stewart, Wayne, Tracy, Cooper, Gable and Cagney) of the golden age, but while PWT and AATR are very good, this is not a 'best of' collection by any means.  All have been released on DVD previously.",1369699200,198,831,4.7172413793103445
5555765,5,B00B4NLCEU,GREAT MOVIES,1504569600,,12,5.5
5555766,5,B00B4NLCEU,"Really enjoy these retro films. Bring back memories of watching them with my mother as a child. Always good movie content that does not need much supervision as the language is always clean, and no heavy suggestive content in the movies. Love having these as part of my collection",1493942400,3,280,4.73469387755102
5555767,4,B00B4NLCEU,"Great for a Gary Cooper fan, a nice set.  I just find the story lines a tad tedious and the Grant's characters are written and directed often as somewhat gay (in the old sense) and silly, probably really quite remarkable for the era.",1490486400,,233,4.4186046511627906

8562466,5,B00B4NLCEU,"Purchased for a ""movies with PopPop"" family night, to introduce Monkey Business to our 8 and 11 yo grandkids. They are intrigued by b&w movies. It was a hit. They giggled away. Good quality Good purchase.",1510272000,2,204,4.694444444444445
8562467,3,B00B4NLCEU,"I have bought six of this and returned five, three here at Amazon with one of those being the one that I settled on. Here is the problem, and it is a big one. The case design is a cardboard slip case where discs slide down into little slots for safe keeping. The cardboard is not slick enough, nor safe enough, for the disc surfaces and, as such, the discs are all scratched and, furthermore, scratched to an extreme degree. In one set, every disc was scratched so heavily over so much of the surface that I didn't even bother testing them. The one I kept, the best of six, has scratches on each disc, of course, but the scratching is only heavy on two discs and is lighter and more spread out on the other four. Be aware of the issues with this set and the highly variable quality on it when you purchase and make sure to check your discs carefully. Good luck with this one.",1507507200,29,875,4.214285714285714
