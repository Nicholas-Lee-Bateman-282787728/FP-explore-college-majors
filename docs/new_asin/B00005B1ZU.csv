7936449,3,B00005B1ZU,"""Another year, another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist/dp/630582469X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist</a>&nbsp;sequel"" could have been the slogan of the direct-to-video martial arts scene in the 1990s, thanks to the relentless efforts of Don Wilson and Roger Corman. Though his career was still in full swing, Wilson was winding down on his trademark series by the time this one came out, which is a bit of a shame since the movies were starting to pick up again from their slump. The longest-running martial arts series in American cinema wasn't nearly as good as I would have hoped, but installment seven here is an acceptable action-thriller worth a watch for fans.

The story: after rescuing a beautiful stranger (Jillian McWhirter,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Progeny/dp/6305300739/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Progeny</a>), ex-soldier Jim Trudell (Wilson) kills a police officer in self-defense and is plunged into vicious web of underworld dealings and police corruption.

The shorter these low-budget action flicks are, the better, and Don Wilson's fare definitely falls under that rule. It's just easier to keep both the story and the action flowing if a movie is, say, under 90 minutes, and ""Manhunt"" obliges in this regard with an 87-minute runtime. The effect is evident: the film establishes some definite intrigue, especially within its first half, and the action is well-spaced so that you never have to go too long without a fight or a chase scene. However, the movie's strongest asset is its surprisingly strong supporting cast. Wilson has charisma, but it's the other performers who carry the drama. Mystery woman Jillian McWhirter - one of the few name actresses of the B-movie realm who don't need to get naked to get noticed - makes the most of her scenes, and the inimitable Steven Williams (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/21-Jump-Street/dp/B003K2G0TA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">21 Jump Street</a>) steals every scene he's in as the police captain. Cyril O'Reilly (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Porky-s/dp/B000HEZESM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Porky's</a>) also makes a memorable appearance as Trudell's ex-military buddy.

Action-wise, ""Manhunt"" is a slight departure from Wilson's typical output in that there are no less than three on-foot chases.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/District-B13/dp/B000GPPPTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">District B13</a>&nbsp;these ain't, but it's interesting to see Wilson running from opponents rather than demolishing them in short order...although there is plenty of that. The best fight of the bunch is the first - a relatively satisfying bar brawl - but after that, the fights are either too brief, feature too boring choreography, and/or are too one-sided. Even a credible opponent like kickboxer Paolo Tocha (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Born-to-Defense/dp/B0001KL3A0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Born to Defense</a>) only has a very short match with Wilson, and karate god Howard Jackson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Full-Contact/dp/6302865239/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Full Contact</a>) is featured but doesn't even get to fight.

If your expectations of Don Wilson movies are low, then this one may be a mildly welcome surprise and a good little time-passer. Treat it as such to get the most out of it.",1407974400,,3574,6.712742980561555
7936450,3,B00005B1ZU,"Bloodfist VII was a slight improvement over the hooky die hard Rip-off Bloodfist VI, but I found the series to be wearing a little thin by now. This time Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson is an ex-Special Forces agent that gets wrongfully blamed for murder and then is pursued by the cops. Sounds like ""The Fugitive"" you say? Well, yes it respembles that film on some aspects. If you liked the first films, you will no doubt like this one as well.

Trivia: Look for Mad TV's Michael McDonald as the ""Running Cop"". He has actually appeared in three of the Bloodfist films. He also played the jeweler in Bloodfist V and a nuclear technician in Bloodfist VI.",1103328000,,645,4.512820512820513
7936451,3,B00005B1ZU,"This was an average movie with the one true standout being that Paulo Tocha(Paco the Tai fighter from Bloodsport, Born to defence ect.) is here to be the for hide tough guy who doesn't get to display any of his Tai fighting skill and gets his neck snapped. Bad use of talent if you ask me. Don the dragon offers his standard fare as usual.",1012608000,,339,4.230769230769231
