2825149,5,B000PKG798,"Do you like CSI Crime Scene Investigation on TV?  Do you like the series ""Bones"" on TV?  Then you will like ""Mystery Street"" starring a very young Ricardo Montalban.  As Amazon says above - ""proto -CSI techniques - **""
meaning, the beginnings of forensic pathology and crime scene investigation depicted in this flick at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass.

A skeleton is found on Cape Cod in the Sand Dunes by a bird watcher and a doctor at Harvard begins the medical investigation.  The scene where Ricardo Montalban as the investigator and the Harvard doctor superimpose photographs of people onto photographs of the skeleton's skull in order to identify the victim is maybe crude by today's DNA standards technology, but, fascinating nevertheless.

  And oh so typical, the Boston Detectives visit the Harvard campus and get lost even though they work in Boston (proper) 6 miles away.  Typical Boston.  If you also like Alfred Hitchcock movies and/or film noir, you will enjoy this film.

As the Amazon review mentions above, the camera work is exceptional.  The ending of the movie with the camera work in the Boston train station is incredible, with changing angles and foreground shots of train car wheels, staircases and railings providing angular framing. Very Hitchcock-esque and hopefully my comment is no insult to John Alton.

As far as film noir goes, there are plenty of dark scenes, especially the detectives work rooms - dingy with inadequate light desk lamps and the boarding room scenes can be dark as well.

** from Amazon:
**Mystery Street (1950), a hard-edged movie about a B-girl's murder and some of the proto-CSI techniques the police use to solve the crime. Directed by John Sturges, from a script by Richard Brooks and Sydney Boehm, the picture is enhanced by atmospheric Boston and Cape Cod settings and camerawork by Mr. Film Noir himself, John Alton. --Richard T.

2825150,5,B000PKG798,"Act of Violence is one of those near-forgotten post-war noirs that really deserves to be better remembered than it is. Nobody at MGM did angst like Van Heflin and nobody did disgusted rage like Robert Ryan, and both are in their element here. Heflin's the ordinary decent guy with a secret whose past catches up with him when an obsessed Ryan starts stalking him and his wife, but what's new here is the motive for Ryan's relentless revenge - hinted at in the early shot of a Memorial Day veterans' parade - and the small town setting, shooting a thriller about guilt and collaboration on the same backlot streets that Andy Hardy and dozens of MGM musicals breezily inhabited. Fred Zinnemann's direction is superb and with a harder edge than his reputation implies, making great use not only of Robert Surtees' striking photography but also the often underemployed possibilities of sound - not just the shuffling of the limping Robert Ryan but also the gurgling of taps, the noise of oars and all the little sounds that loom large and threatening in the night. The film even avoids traditional opening credits, getting straight down to business as soon as it gets the title card out of the way. It also boasts a trio of well-cast female roles embodying most of the noir archetypes - Janet Leigh's idealised wife, Phyliss Thaxter's helpless girlfriend and, best of all, Mary Astor's remarkable turn as a past her prime hooker whose attempts to help only drag the less than heroic Heflin down further on the way to a powerful ending at once fatalistic and redemptive. Terrific stuff.

Mystery Street isn't in the same league - more of a production-line police procedural - but good direction from John Sturges and typically excellent photography from John Alton make it a satisfying supporting feature.

Along with good transfers, there's a good selection of extras as well: Act of Violence features an audio commentary by Drew Casper, featurette Dealing With the Devil and the original trailer while Mystery Street has an audio commentary by Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward, featurette Murder at Harvard and original theatrical trailer.",1292630400,6,2135,4.944289693593315
2825151,5,B000PKG798,"Two unknown Noir films to me turned out to be fantastic movies and an enjoyable evening !
""Act of Violence"" with Ricardo Montalban as a very sharp and witty Police detective and ""Mystery Street"" with Van Heflin & Robert Ryan as former wartime friends with a dark secret.
Both of these movies are grade A in my book !!",1291075200,,317,4.389830508474576
2825152,5,B000PKG798,"I'd seen Mystery Street and is a pretty good police procedural, closer to Naked City than Film Noir.  But Act Of Violence was a revelation.  Its beautifully shot and has the two things that really make Film Noir.  First, ambiguity.  Situations and characters are not what they appear to be and second, the main character is doomed.  Sure, there will be twists and turns along the way but like pulling the stopper out of a drain, its just a matter of time.  Van Heflin was never a favorite of mine but he's fine for this role.  In my book, Robert Ryan is up there with Mitchum.  These guys are not to be messed with and if you like Film Noir, Act Of Violence is not to be missed.",1280534400,,678,4.2421875
2825153,4,B000PKG798,"ACT OF VIOLENCE's plot is a very simple one; it involves Joe Parkson (Robert Ryan) hunting down his old commanding officer, Frank Enley (Van Heflin).  Parkson has been nursing a grudge for two years, because Enley ratted on a POW escape attempt that ended up killing most of his men, and leaving Parkson lame.

Enley has been making good since the end of the war; helping to house the less fortunate, and being a model citizen.  The film begins with shots of Parkson, who has just found where Enley is from a newspaper story; getting his gun, and looking very much the predator.

Van Heflin and Robert Ryan are superb here.  And this is also a good turn for Mary Astor, who was photographed without much make-up: a short, but wonderful performance from her.  Janet Leigh and Berry Kroeger are also both very effective.

But the real stars here are probably cinematographer Robert Surtees and director Fred Zinnemann.  The film is lit and shot beautifully in a textured combination of the Expressionist and Neorealist styles.  And the pace is fast through the entire 82 minutes.  This is the first film noir from MGM that I can recommend wholeheartedly; a fantastic 1948 film.

MYSTERY STREET (1950) is better than I thought it would be....  While being a ground-breaking forensic procedural, it is also an engrossing mystery.  Recommended.

Both films are part of the Film Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 4; a set of 10 films on DVD that is currently retailing for $3.00 a film.  Great value.",1277164800,2,1490,4.788235294117647
2825154,3,B000PKG798,"MYSTERY STREET(1950)---Ricardo Montalban, Sally Forrest, Bruce Bennett,Jan Sterling,Elsa Lanchester, Marshall Thompson, Betsy Blair.
Nancy and I were discussing this film a few days ago in regard to it's focus on forensics to help solve a murder. That prompted me to give it another look. It's a straightforward ""noir whodunnit""(John Alton's cinematography is, as usual, first-rate), with Ricardo Montalban trying to solve the murder of ""B-girl"" Jan Sterling. The problem is complicated because no one but the murderer knows that a crime has occurred until Sterling's skeleton is discovered buried in beach sand by a bird-watcher 3 months after the murder was committed. Montalban calls upon a Harvard forensics expert, played by Bruce Bennett, to assist him in identifying the victim and in solving the case. Marshall Thompson plays a young married man wrongly accused of the murder. Sally Forrest plays his wife, who ""stands by her man"" through it all. Elsa Lanchester appears in this film also and she is marvelous as the avaricious, hypocritical landlady who owns the rooming house that Sterling lived in. Through an accumulation of small details, Lanchester figures out who the real murderer is and attempts to blackmail him. Betsy Blair plays another tenant of the rooming house who also helps to put the pieces of the puzzle together. A good film, well worth watching. It's available as part of Volume 4 of the Warner Bros., ""Classic Film Noir"" series.",1257638400,,1459,5.212765957446808
2825155,4,B000PKG798,"""Act Of Violence""  -  This was a decent film noir that could have been a super film noir, but it kind of bogged down with a half hour to go with a little too much nagging women. Had it kept its edge with the crime story and fantastic cinematography, this would be a film to treasure. It was still okay overall.

Kudos to cinematography Robert Surtees and director Fred Zinnemann, both of whom did a wonderful job making this visually interesting.
It also has an interesting cast with, in my opinion, Robert Ryan and Mary Astor giving us the best performance, Ryan in the lead and Loy in support, along with Van Heflin. Janet Leigh and Phyllis Thaxter. Loy adds a lot of verbal spark to this film. Her natural delivery in here is terrific to hear.

The ending was a little too predictable, another disappointment in a film that was super for the first hour. Overall, it's still a good film and definitely recommended for noir buffs.

""Mystery Street""  -  gets some historical notoriety because it introduced audiences to forensic science long before ""Quincy"" and ""CSI"" became hit shows on television. But don't be misled: forensic science is only a part of this film; it is not like watching a CSI episode.

****spoiler alert****I thought the leading characters, played by Ricardo Montalban and Bruce Bennett, were upstaged by a couple of ladies, namely Elsa Lanchester and Jan Sterling, although the latter is killed off quickly. Too bad; I always found Sterling a fascinating actress and someone well-suited for film noir. Don't get me wrong: the recently-deceased Montalban was a solid actor, a lot more than the ""Love Boat"" guy people remember him for. The same goes for Bennett, but neither has a lot of spark in here.

This particular story won't keep on edge because we know early on who is the murderer. Like a ""Columbo"" TV episode, the fun is seeing how the cops figure it out.

 The transfer is fine, highlighting the wonderful black and white cinematography we film noir fans so enjoy. Kudos to photographer John Alton and director John Sturges for that. Alton was behind the camera on a number of beautifully-shot film noirs of the late '40s",1239926400,,2152,4.742627345844504
2825156,5,B000PKG798,"Do not miss this picture! Part noir, part docudrama, it features a brilliant, understated performance by the very talented Ricardo Montalban who plays a detective on Cape Cod who must investigate a murder. A good part of the film is shot on location on Cape Cod and in Boston which adds to the film's realism. The cinematography is by John Alton considered to be one of the finest ""noir"" cinematographers. If you watch the DVD commentary, you'll get an idea of just how many great shots are in this film.

The film is unusual in that the narrative does not follow the typical noir script. The protagonist, Lt. Morales, is not introduced until about 20 minutes into the story. We're first introduced to the circumstances of the crime. This expository sequence introduces us to the victim, a barmaid, Vivian (played by Jan Sterling), pregnant by a well-respected businessman on Cape Cod, Harkley, a married man, who she seeks to meet so that presumably he can pay her some money to support the child. Vivian helps Henry Shamway (an ordinary Joe who has been drinking following his wife's miscarriage)move his illegally-parked car but then ends up driving both of them out to the Cape while Shamway is too drunk to know what's going on. Just as he begins to sober up, she dupes Shamway into getting out of the car for a second as she pretends to let him drive the car and leaves him in the middle of nowhere. Before you know it, in a shocking scene, Harkley murders Vivian by shooting her point blank in the chest as she sits in Shamway's car talking to him. Even more shocking, he embraces and acts like he's kissing the dead barmaid to make it appear everything's normal to two passing motorists. Harkley buries the body near the ocean and the skeleton later turns up in a sand dune.

Montalban's Lt. Morales is not your usual noir detective. Not only is he not American born but he keeps a cool head of objectivity as he investigates the crime. Although Morales is the protagonist he is not the hapless male patsy found in many noirs nor does he fall victim to a femme fatale. Shamway is the poor schmuck who is taken advantage by the conniving female (in this case, Vivian, who is immediately dispatched by the principal villain, Harkley).

Lt. Morales goes to Harvard University where we get to see some great forensic investigation with the help of the head of the pathology department at the Medical school. Using a slide projector, they match up a picture of the skull with a missing person's photo. Great Crime Scene Investigation way ahead of its time! The forensic investigation goes even further when they find the car where the murder occurred, dredge it up from a pond and then trace the trajectory of the bullet. Before Morales realizes the victim has been murdered, Shamway is arrested and implicated in the murder. There's a great scene where Morales questions Shamway's wife at their home about his canceled checks. The wife, expertly played by Sally Forrest, slowly becomes more and more emotional as she reads each canceled check which ostensibly is made out for things related to the birth of their child that was not to be (now a double whammy for the wife--the loss of a child and recent arrest of her husband). Despite the wife's emotional outburst, Morales acts true to character: as a hardened detective, he stubbornly clings to the belief that the suspect is truly guilty.

Meanwhile, Vivian's landlady, Mrs. Smerrling (played very nicely as a nasty eccentric by Else Lancester) discovers Vivian's connection to Harkley so she goes to Cape Cod and attempts to blackmail him. She comes away with the murder weapon which later figures in the climactic scene. After Morales obtains a search warrant, searches Harkley's home and is unable to find the gun, Harkley realizes that Mrs. Smerrling stole the gun earlier and goes to her apartment and promptly strangles her!

This is not a sentimental story in the least! When Shamway's wife comes to talk to Mrs. Smerrling, she's knocked down by Harkley just as Morales arrives. Now Morales finally realizes that Shamway is an innocent victim and doggedly searches Smerrling's apartment for the murder weapon. In a great scene, after spending the entire night and finding nothing, Morales is about to leave when he by chance notices the key to a train station locker lying on the bottom of Mrs. Smerrling's parrot's cage! Harkley is one step ahead of Morales when he's able to get Mrs. Smerrling's bag out of the locker only to find himself trapped inside a railway car after being chased by Morales. When he pulls out the gun there's no bullets in it since Vivian's roommate, Jackie, took the clip out earlier.

If you watch the DVD commentary, you'll find out that Jackie is played by Betsy Blair who was blacklisted by the film industry in the early 50s. She finally got back into films after her husband, Gene Kelly, threatened to leave MGM. Mystery Street also deals with the subject of racial prejudice--look for Harkley talking to Morales in his office. In that scene, Harkley shows his class prejudice and disdain for Morales who ""wasn't born here"". Mystery is a great oldie but goodie! Its emphasis on forensic science is way ahead of its time. Ricardo Montalban steals the show as the true-to-life investigating detective. Mystery Street's only flaw is that it places Harvard University a bit too much on a pedestal but for sheer entertainment it really hits the mark!",1236988800,2,5443,4.785106382978723
2825157,4,B000PKG798,"""Act of Violence"" (1949) and ""Mystery Street"" (1950) are both crime films produced by MGM , but they have little else in common. Warner Brothers is billing both films a ""film noir"", a label that suits ""Act of Violence"", though that film is not archetypal noir, but is less apt for ""Murder Street"", which is only superficially or intermittently noir. It's more a straightforward, technophilic murder mystery. ""Mystery Street"" is very well-plotted, however, and both films offer memorable performances. The versatile Van Heflin plays a man hounded by guilt and then by his past in ""Act of Violence"". And Elsa Lanchester gives a scene-stealing supporting performance as an over-the-hill schemer and would-be femme fatale if only she were younger and more clever in ""Mystery Street"".

""Act of Violence"" opens as World War II veteran Joe Parkson (Robert Ryan) prepares to kill someone. He is obsessively pursuing Frank Enley (Van Heflin), his former friend and commanding officer with whom he flew 21 missions before spending the rest of the war in a German POW camp. Joe blames Frank for the deaths of his comrades and intends to make him pay with his life. Frank is now a family man and well-liked civic leader in a small California town. Joe stalks him, disrupts his domestic idyll, frightens his wife Edith (Janet Leigh), and eventually sends Frank running to the city, whose back alleys are little consolation as Joe closes in.

This film has a pronounced symmetry: It becomes increasingly introverted and visually dark as Frank succumbs to fear and guilt. Joe, who initially seems unbalanced and blindly obsessive, becomes more rational as the film progresses. One goes up as the other goes down. There are three women who try to dissuade three men from self-destructive paths: Edith tries to protect her husband Frank. Joes' girlfriend Ann (Phyllis Thaxter) tries to thwart his homicidal ambition. And Pat, a haggard hooker made unforgettable by Mary Astor, is also out to discourage an assassin. Nice shadowy interior and night photography by Robert Surtees accentuates the ugly effects of the war on the minds of the two veterans.

In ""Mystery Street"", a cheeky blonde bombshell named Vivian Heldon (Jan Sterling) is murdered by her married lover. An amateur ornithologist studying sandpipers finds her remains on the beach 6 months later. With nothing to go on but bones, Police Lieutenant Pete Morales (Ricardo Montalban) sends what remains of the skeleton to a pioneering forensic pathologist at Harvard University, Dr. McAdoo (Bruce Bennett), who is eventually able to identify the woman as Vivian. Eager to solve his first murder case, Morales follows the trail to Mrs. Smerrling (Elsa Lanchester), the treacherous proprietress of the boarding house where Vivian lived, and to a hapless man she was with before she died (Marshall Thompson).

John Alton, the best-known of film noir cinematographers -and one that I sometimes find too showy, does some lovely work in ""Mystery Street"". As is his tendency, he often lets the characters go completely into shadow. He called it ""mystery lighting"". But ""Mystery Street"" is a straightforward police procedural with an emphasis on new techniques in forensic science. If anything is striking about this film, it is its occasional foray into the macabre. The cast is unusual for a detective story in that it is an ensemble. Morales is no more prominent than anyone else, and it is Mrs. Smerrling's  greed and vulgarity that is most memorable. There is a man wrongly accused as well, so elements common to film noir are incorporated into a conventional, but particularly well-plotted, murder mystery.

The DVD (Warner Bros. 2007): Discs from Warner Brothers' ""Film Noir Classic Collection Vol. 4"" have no scene menus, making it very difficult for anyone studying the films to find what they are looking for. Both films have a featurette (5 minutes each) in which film critics and historians talk about the film, a theatrical trailer, and a feature commentary. The constant, somewhat manic commentary for ""Act of Violence"" is by Dr. Drew Casper of the University of Southern California. He discusses the score, performances, pacing, script, themes, how characters are revealed, and more. The commentary for ""Mystery Street"" is by Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward, who talk about the cinematography, cast, plot, docu-noir style, staging, and scene analysis. Subtitles for both films are available in English SDH and French.",1222128000,25,4468,5.155862068965517
2825158,4,B000PKG798,"This started slow, but once the very anguished Robert Ryan kicks in, the movie gains momentum.
It's classic film noir - all dark with long shadows; but the performances transcend the genre - particularly the women - Janet Leigh (very young), and Mary Astor as a woman drinking alone in a bar.
Intriguing is the way Robert Ryan before a late redemption is all oily makeup, but at the very end when cleansed of responsibility while bending over a dead Van Heflin, his face is suddenly fresh and clean.

It had been talked about on a TV crime procedural show some time ago, I believe it was either Bones or NCIS, where one of the characters was talking about the origins of forensic crime solving. The movie was made in 1950 and Hollywoodized the work of the Boston University professor that was one of the fathers of modern forensic methods. It was interesting to see how some of the methods that this professor developed are still used, using modern equipment, such as computers.
