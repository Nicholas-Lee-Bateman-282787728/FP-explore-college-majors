This is the same show as the first concert from Japan but what really sets this show apart are the excellent solo performances. As a result, this concert runs nearly three and a half hours on two dvd discs.  I was really impressed by Jessica's piano playing. The touching video before and during the ""Danny boy"" performance is not to be missed. All in all, this disc is worth its weight in gold. I don't know if there's a bluray of this concert but if not now hopefully soon.",1491955200,,640,4.203252032520325

I'm a bit too lazy to put up the tracklisting for the concert :P but if you look for the review of ""2011 Girls' Generation Tour"" the user Paul Harris has the whole tracklisting of both DVDs so feel free to check it out (that's how i found out)

Overall, I am a HUGE SONE and have been ever since ""Into The New World"" so if you wanna have a DVD in your collection along with a poster, get this and you'll enjoy it
