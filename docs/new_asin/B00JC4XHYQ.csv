6354112,4,B00JC4XHYQ,"Great educational and enlightening video. I would have given five stars had it included subtitles. A minor gripe perhaps, but subtitles would have made it easier to understand, especially for those whose native tongues aren't English.",1413763200,8,234,5.527777777777778
6354113,5,B00JC4XHYQ,"Well done documentary. They summarized many basics of capitalism in a very coherent way (almost school-like). I like the fact that they point out the history of how the economy has gotten us to where it is now and the been abuses done at our expense, but without all the negativity. They didn't make it about placing the blame, it was more constructive and educational by making sense of a lot of pieces to the economic puzzle we may have known but not (until now) been able to put them all together as well as pointing out ways that could correct it.",1403395200,18,551,4.411764705882353
6354114,5,B00JC4XHYQ,"I can't believe no one has reviewed this documentary? I wish everyone could see it! I highly recommend watching it! This isn't one of those fear-mongering, conspiracy-theory, doomsday documentaries. Instead, it's just good old brilliant common-sense that involves a solution to a major problem.
Considering the sometimes complicated subjects discussed, this documentary is very easily explained. Not in a dumbed-down way, on the contrary, it is still quite academic. I think it has to do with the superb way in which it is produced and edited.
Do yourselves a favor and check it out! You'll be glad you did.",1402963200,24,607,5.141414141414141

6354116,5,B00JC4XHYQ,"A brilliant documentary with a horrible conclusion: there is no way out of this sewer created by big banks, wall street and the banking cartel called the Fed, run by the Rothchilds, Rockfellers, and Morgans.

6354118,3,B00JC4XHYQ,"Up until about an hour into it, it's really good. After that, the global NWO agenda (21 and 2030) points are added: overpopulation (not true), get away from money and have a global financial system and a global legal system, etc. It's subtle and sneaky. Look at life in America before income taxes, the Federal Reserve, and big government. We had roads, businesses, amusement parks, vacation homes, trains, fashion, plenty to eat, and real home ownership. Why do we need to be sold on yet another corporate-government financial scheme? Just because the global money system is going to be based on the gold standard, does not mean we have to adopt it. America can go back to its own gold standard, its own sovereignty, and individual freedom with private land ownership. The government isn't lawfully allowed to own land, anyway. It has no right to tax 'free' resources; they belong to the people. The people do not need to beg the government for wealth. All the wealth of the land belongs to the people as individuals. We don't need the District of Columbia's corporation, we don't need Wall Street, and we don't need the UN's NWO.",1493683200,4,1131,4.775510204081633
6354119,3,B00JC4XHYQ,"A good documentary in terms of a simple explanation on the decline of empire. A bad documentary in the sheer arrogance of thinking it would do anything to stop it. They even at one point cite the internet as a potential savior to free all of us wage slaves from our bonds. In 2017 it's easy to see the Internet just made the bread and circuses available 24/7. In a post-truth world where almost everyone is insanely narcissistic enough to believe their being offended means the the world should bend to their will there's no pulling back. And if you think there is, remember we just elected a reality TV star to be president who gives his children and in-laws more power than Saddam Hussein ever did, and is already 100% impeachable for violating emoluments clause, and yet we hear about his Twitter feed on the nightly news. Welcome to the end, my friends.",1492646400,17,857,4.571428571428571
6354120,4,B00JC4XHYQ,Overall very good points; the discussion of classical vs neo-classical economics was very good-bankers and multi-national corporations have taken over our political system in the U.S.A. and Worldwide.  I don't totally buy the idea that natural resources such as oil are limited or that the only reason that muselums are violent is because they are poverty stricken as a result of infrastructure projects that take their farmland that is financed by the banks.  Very much worth watching-draw your own conclusions.,1492300800,,512,5.3875

6354122,2,B00JC4XHYQ,"... anything here that separates our system of finance from the systems of finance that have existed for the duration of human business.  Since the first human traded a thing he had for a thing he wanted, value has been in the eye of the beholder on each side of the bargain.  If both sides didn't agree on the value of the other person's item, no trade took place.  Currency, whether corn or shells or beads or mirrors or buffalo skins or arrowheads or land or the paper in your wallet or the binary code that states your personal wealth at your internet bank, has always been fiat.  Simply put, currency is no more valuable than the demand for it.  The problem always manifests itself in someone doubting its value.  That's where the cracks begin to show, but it has always been that way.  This system has always had the same faults and it only functions because people believe in it.  If you realized the paper in your wallet was just paper and that it only has value because someone somewhere in some position of authority says is worth a dollar, and millions of us woke up to that at the same time, the whole thing would collapse in a few hours.  We'd be back to barter before dark.
Regarding corruption,  dishonesty has been around a while too.  None of this is new stuff, so let's not pretend it is nor fall in behind talking heads that say it is.  Yes, what ever the issue is must be the worst in history because there are more people now.  It is simply the ratio of scale.  The magnitude of all that I saw in this film is really nothing more than commentary on the mechanics of historical economics and its associated treachery made much worse by overpopulation.  The rich make money and the poor make babies and it has always been that way.  There was an undertone vilifying capitalism in this film, as though it is inherently insidious and undermines stability.  That just isn't true.  Capitalism works, but only if you do, and only if you spend less than you make.

This is a tutorial. A viewpoint, or rather a compilation of viewpoints and we may not be in full agreement nor understand every dimension of every syllable presented. But, BOY WAS THIS GOOD!

The Four Horsemen opens up educated, experienced, and brilliant thought on what matters to everyone.  Pretty basic, right?  What matters to everyone is complicated.  By exigency, complicated things are made moreso by every other complication on earth.

Hilariously, at the mention of repeal of Glass Steigall, a 3 millisecond mention and grainy, tiny picture of Bill Clinton zips by.

They frame everything through a lens of ""morality and philosophy,"" obviously predetermined by them, neglecting to shine a light on the benefits of capitalism or what role technology will play in how we progress (and how we obtain that tech without money). While espousing Morality, this documentary tells us we have to get back to local economies and shows pictures of  well-dressed white people working in fields and then literally a couple minutes later talks about ""global poverty by the millions"" and shows a dark-skinned person in hand-me-downs working in fields. It laments over the fact that the nuclear family has been broken and women were ""forced"" to enter the workforce to help pay mortgages back in the 50's (not because women fought to be equal contributors to the communities the doc later blames the lack of for the downfall of said Morality) It claims the industrialized capitalism we've been enjoying for a few generations is going to collapse horribly, particularly due to a lack of resources, without acknowledging technological advancements that will free us from the use of non-renewable natural resources, particularly those used for power (e.g solar, cleaner/more efficient nuclear power, etc.).

Much like the ""Hollywoodization"" of the human struggle that one expert speaks about, this documentary's intention is to enrage, not inspire, to react, not think. It definitely won't appeal to those familiar with logical fallacies or skepticism in its presentation, that's for sure.",1463616000,6,1611,5.338582677165355

The 'film,"" as it is characterized by its producers, is a very *slick package* of anti-west propaganda, pure and simple. It even states that those who find it to be ""offensive"" will try to marginalize it as ""socialist or even marxist,"" which it, in fact, may well be. None-the-less, it is ""offensive"" to those of us who have found in the West and the United States of America in particular a true, unadulterated avenue to gain from our own efforts. It spits in the face of that and those of us who have found that and have profited most fairly from it...",1460678400,2,638,4.415254237288136
6354341,2,B00JC4XHYQ,"Technically, everything about this documentary is high quality: videography, music, narration, animation, editing, all truly professional. Alas, the actual content is a mishmash of half-truths, half-baked ideas, and half-chewed solutions that smell of ideological blindness to what real-world planning and implementation would require. The crippling weakness here begins with the choice of 'experts' being interviewed: fringe Wall Street players, marginal academics, and retired economists, plus a few really odd characters. It is unfortunate, because the social issues tackled here are real, the fundamental financial fault lines are detrimental, and the trajectory of growing debt and declining upward opportunities justify a sense of long-term pessimism. In summary, a documentary that could have been superb, but deteriorates into empty conspiratorial tones and ominous generalities. Overall, somewhat thought-provoking, but ultimately disappointing.",1460678400,2,954,6.4609375
6354342,5,B00JC4XHYQ,"This was a great documentary.  I've always said the one fault of capitalism is greed.  One of the worst thing our country allowed is an unregulated Wall Street that has become too big to fail. Now it's really a mess, think about it, everything is tied into Wall Street; 401Ks, Military TSP, politics, media, and many other sources.  Retirement plans are all tied into stock instead of the companies paying retirement.  One of the rules of investing is never put all your eggs in one basket, yet with big bank mergers that is exactly what they are doing.  Now these businesses are insured and no matter how much the screw up, the federal government has no choice but to bail them out because if they fail they take millions of investors with them.

Progress isn't perfect, but there would be no globally significant wonders like Google, Facebook and companies in all major industries without them. Like with cars, banks do need regulation and at least in the US, Dodd-Frank is fine for now and the bank bailout actually turned out profitable for the government while saving the banking system.

The beauty of fractional reserve banking is it furthers investing, leveraging ideas, talents and actual needs. As for the risks of a fiat currency, ultimately US currency, still the world's premier reserve currency, is backed by all the assets of America- public land, resources, universities, etc, and even intellectual and physical talent. Plus, one can use it to buy gold if one wants. In fact, that it depreciates is an intentional benefit since that discourages hoarding, thus benefiting investing. It's called capitalism. Sure, there will be cycles, booms and busts, but that is humanity.

The bottom line is the world is the most prosperous (% above poverty), heathy (life expectancy), peaceful (% dying from war), etc. I trust progress.",1458950400,4,1202,5.190721649484536

The film keeps your attention while setting a context for why the world is in the state it's in.

6354403,5,B00JC4XHYQ,"A thought provoking movie.  Does an excellent job of presenting how we have gotten to this point in the evolution of humanity.  The quote used in the film by Frederic Bastiat ,"" When plunder becomes a way of life for a group of men living together in society, they create for themselves in the course of time a legal system that authorizes it and a moral code that glorifies it."", truly gets to the heart of this film.  We as a society have allowed the banking system to take over our government where they are glorified, the legal system has authorized it (think the Supreme Court saying a corporation is a person and can contribute any amount of money to politics) and then has convinced themselves and the populace that it is morally acceptable to live beyond our means individually and collectively.  It is now morally acceptable to consume everything in our midst and we are obligated to continue doing so - think George W. Bush telling all of us to go out and shop after 9/11.  That strategy has only resulted in what another quote from the film by Tyler Durden highlights:  ""The things you own end up owning you.""

Watch this film with an open mind and truly try to visualize how we can change our present trajectory.  We will all have to pay the piper at some point and we must decide if we are willing to pay more because of the greed at the top or if we are willing to finally say stop the madness and take back control of our destiny. If we continue to lament our lot and become apathetic about our ability to correct the system, then the corporations and bankers have won and we get what we deserve.",1455408000,2,1611,4.4006734006734005

6354418,2,B00JC4XHYQ,"I'm just going to quote from Richard on IMDB:

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

When a documentary attempts to tackle the most important issues of a generation, from financial instability, to environmental degradation and terrorism, it really needs to be backed up with a lot of solid research. Unfortunately, Four Horsemen hopelessly fails to live up to its ambitions. It touches on everything from the decline of empires, to the expansion of credit and disastrous banking deregulation.

It rightfully highlights the asset bubbles, the failures of foreign aid and the counter productive nature of much of the west's foreign policy. But touch is the generous word, as most issues are addressed with little more than a talking head tied together with some slick animation and stock footage. The film is strongest when stating the obvious, highlighting the offences of the banking industry, the predatory lending and illegal foreclosures. Indeed, when describing exactly what is wrong, Four Horsemen takes few risks and lands some critical blows, a welcome reintroduction for a debate that is most conspicuous by its absence.

But the first warning sign for the film is when the entire history of human economics is framed in the terms of Classical versus Neoclassical, followed by the pushing of quite extreme Libertarian pet causes proposed as the only possible solutions. It marks wholly disingenuous connections regarding the glory days of the gold standard and becomes almost comical when it praises FDR on one hand and then claims 'income tax is inherently unconstitutional' on the other.

A few quotes from the US Constitution and a lecture on the decline of morality, and the whole film starts to feel like a Ron Paul 2012 direct to YouTube creation. Then when casual remarks drop like: 'perhaps global warming isn't the greatest threat to our planet, but the depletion of resources', (a statement that so comprehensively against mainstream scientific opinion which contends we cannot afford to burn even the oil we have found), and the film starts to make Zeitgeist appear the model of impartial reasoning.

When this is rapidly followed by 'all foreign aid is bad', suddenly the minuscule on screen presence of the most lauded guests, such highly respected development economic Ha-Joon Chang (who appears on screen just twice for a total of about sixty seconds), and the motives behind the recurring presence of the gold and silver traders becomes a little clearer. The producers of Four Horsemen may be well meaning, and who isn't rightfully outraged at the 'heads we win, tails you lose' attitude of Goldman Sachs and their ilk, or the ridiculous disconnect between real wages and real estate prices? I also doubt the proposition that 'we need more employee owned businesses' would ever lose a show of hands outside a GOP convention.

But overflowing as the film is with justified indignation, the proposed solutions have all the hallmarks of a stock Libertarian: 'tax is theft, government is bad' economic thesis, albeit cleverly packaged to sneak in front of a left leaning cinema audience.",1454025600,9,3111,5.136363636363637

Sad to say, this is popular with many foolish ill informed people.  Check out DiscoverTheNetworks.org.  School yourself on what and who this little cabal in academia are.  Noam Chomsky is a terrorist apologist, a Holocaust denier, a Palestine terrorist supporter, a USA hater, a rich,white guy, and this incredibly well put together piece of propaganda should be used as a lesson on 'how to create propaganda'. He showcases himself with IMF alumni (International Monetary Fund) as co-experts.  It is almost too funny. Propaganda is so valuable and evil, because it uses seeds of truth, and manipulates those facts into a sneaky, messy convoluted story to support the end result the author is seeking.

The movie does not try to tackle that other than getting glass steagal back.  The movie talks about predatory lending but does not blame government pressure on banks to offer sub prime loans.

This film makes you think about our world economy and our own here in the U.S. It's amazing to have the economical years before 2011 summed up and explained in such a way that everyone can understand. It opens your eyes to what really happened when the economy crashed and who was to blame, so to speak. I can't believe how I just passively let all of that go. The movie was copyrighted in 2011 and amazingly had predicted the past years 2012 to present economically. I think that people should watch this film, not just for information about what has happened in the past, but to understand what is going to happen in the future to our way of life, our economy, and our government. It will make you want to look at our political figures more deeply and become more educated about what they stand for and who they stand for, themselves or the people.

6354480,4,B00JC4XHYQ,"I struggled to give this 4 stars or 3.  The quality of the film is very good, so my rating is more based on the intellectual content.

First, this movie is so much like the ""Occupy Wall Street"" movement: It rightly curses certain conditions, it rages against the criminals, and it calls for change.  The movie even correctly identifies the problem with banking and fiat currency.  However, it is calling for the wrong change and is blaming ""free markets"" for the current woes.  It also curses capitalism throughout most of the film, then later tries to say, ""no, no, we are capitalists...just not this kind of capitalist.""  In this way, I feel that it further confuses people.  I would love to recommend this film to everyone I know, however, I would feel compelled to preemptively counter many of their conclusions and suggestions for change.

They should have done a better job on the terminology.  The United States is not purely capitalist, and we most certainly do not have free markets.  If anything, the U.S. is, according to Mussolini's own definition, Fascist.  It is more common now to say ""Corporatist"", but even Ralph Nader joins most free-market economists in saying that the US has a fascist economy.  As such, this film is smearing free markets and improperly defining them.  Any country that uses fiat currency does not have a free market.

So, the film correctly identifies the problem with fiat currencies and fractional reserve banking. I discusses what happened when Nixon took us off the gold standard, and it even showed a graph of U.S. inflation going out of whack starting in 1913 (the year the Federal Reserve was established). However, several of those interviewed espoused more Keynesian type economic solutions, and Keynes was a big fan of central economic planning, such as the Fed and fiat currency.  So there were contradictions within the film.

Further, it seems to me that there was a political goal to place all blame on Reagan and Milton Friedman.  While they definitely deserve some of the blame, the problems have been growing for more than a century.  Lincoln, FDR, and others should have received blame too.  Later in the film they emphasized the need for decentralized government...so why then do they praise those who strengthened the central government (e.g. Lincoln, FDR, etc)?

Lastly, I think they portrayed a skewed view of individualism. Free markets, anarchocapitalism, libertarianism, whatever you want to call them, most certainly promote the idea of self-reliance, but at the same time they acknowledge the need for community.  However, strong communities can only be built through individual freedom.  People must be allowed to voluntarily choose whether or not to associate, then assume the consequences of that association or disassociation.  In our current system (and with socialism and communism), the individuals do not have a choice; as such, because they are compelled by force and because such a system shrinks the pie, they become more selfish and less interested in helping others.  Although it may seem counterintuitive, that's the way it tends to work.  I bring this up because we have to be careful when using words such as ""individualism"", ""greed"", and ""selfishness""; these human tendencies are what allow humans to survive. It is when they are captured and exploited by governments that they become very destructive.

All-in-all, I would give this movie 3.5 stars.  It was great in identifying some very critical flaws (fiat currency, corporatism, banking fraud, etc), but I took off 1.5 stars for the fact that I feel that many of their suggestions for change are based on ideology, not sound logic or a solid understanding of how humans chose to act (praxeology) under free or confined conditions.  Lastly, it can't be said enough that there is a major difference between laws and government.  Laws and courts can exist without government...if anything it's government that often violates the system of law.",1440806400,5,3978,5.067588325652841

The only issue I had with it is that it tries to be a bit of alarmist where it doesn't need to be.

It seems like they're jumping to conclusions.

They made up a an idea called neo-capitalism where the economy is controlled by the government and contrasted it with classic capitalism where the economy is free, open, and decentralized. They then go on to claim that it spawned from the likes of Milton Friedman and influenced much of Reagan's economic policy.

First, there is no such thing as neo-capitalism, and if there is, it most certainly is not related to Friedman. He was the biggest advocate for purely free market economies.

There is however a term called neo-liberalism that was coined back in the Reagan era, but the economics related to that concept were without a doubt classical.
