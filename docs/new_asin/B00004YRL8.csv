7927479,4,B00004YRL8,"Lino Ventura, M. Serrault and Romy Schneider. What else can you say? And Guy Marchand (from the seedy detective series ""Nestor Burma""). The script flows like a clockwork orange, of course aided by Serrault, who could make rocks weep, laugh and commit suicide. Lino Ventura is believable, almost likable, as a tough cop who ""doesn't really care who gets nailed"" but can't forget the young victims, and won't be distracted from a suspect even if he's got style and wit.

Why does the ending disappoint? Probably a tad melodramatic and manipulative, it doesn't harm an already superb film. It only makes it far from perfect.
I agree with IMDB's reviewer ""Taylor, from Ottawa"" that ""night scenes in a steady rain"" by Bruno Nuytten create the perfect oppressive if somewhat awkward climate, necessary for this theatrical plot to unfold. Enjoy, if possible on a damp night :)!

PS: The remake ""Under suspicion""... Hackman is fine, but can't reach
Michel's subtlety and yet how disagreeable he can be; he seems born for
this ""gifted neurotics"" roles. Monica Bellucci is nice, but cannot
carry the nostalgia Schneider exudes. W. Chisholm's review on Amazon is
right she shows Visconti's training. Adaptations should only be made
when improving on the original, don't you think :)?",1272499200,2,1272,5.052380952380952
7927480,5,B00004YRL8,"I saw this in the theatre in the early 80's and it ripped my head open. Michel Serrault was known at the time for an innocuous fag comedy ""La Cage Aux Folles"" - he could not make a make a more different character move. This film is gut wrenching. Lino Ventura is of course Lino Ventura - a real tough guy with a brain. And Romy Schneider shows the chops from her training with Visconti. God she is missed when you think of how crap most Hollywood beauties are as actresses. Be warned, this is a very tough movie if you have children, but worth it. I would stand in the rain for a day to screen this in a theatre, so there. I think it was badly remade by Hollywood. the rights must be tied up by someone which is why it's not available on regular DVD. If you want gripping drama and GREAT acting this is it.",1243728000,8,806,4.0754716981132075
7927481,4,B00004YRL8,"If you prefer action movies with running, shooting, and car chases

to slow films with lots of dialog, then this one is not for you.

Otherwise try it out. ""Garde  vue"" has good taste and high tension.

Of course, the acting is great.",1170892800,3,234,4.372093023255814
