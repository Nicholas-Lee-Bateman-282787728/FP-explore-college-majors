7084365,4,B00VAVNN5W,"After watching the trailer for this a few weeks ago (before I had read any reviews or knew anything about it) I became really excited and couldn't wait to watch it.

As some reviews have said, this is a movie you're either going to love or hate. While I initially felt that the hype led to some disappointment, I have found myself thinking about the movie quite frequently ever since then. It's basically The Ring, but instead of the curse being transferred after watching a videotape, it's after having intercourse with a person who has it following them. Stylistically I loved the way the director composed his shots, allowing you to be swallowed into the environment. I thought this was very effective in a sense that it allowed the audience to always be on the lookout for something strange going on in the background. This always left every scene filled with a little bit of dread and anxiety. This is a type of movie that doesn't rely on jump scares or anything like that, but the tension and fear of waiting for something to happen as the camera pans around the environment waiting to see if there is anything strange lurking about. The accompanying score also proved to be very effective and one of my favorite things about the movie.

I could go on about some of the themes and what I think it represents and how it manifests itself throughout the movie, but I'll allow someone else to watch it and come to their own terms. That's what I think makes this an effective horror movie. Is not that it's just scary, but that it leaves the audience thinking. And I haven't stopped thinking about it ever since.",1427760000,5,1613,4.577854671280277
7084366,4,B00VAVNN5W,"""It Follows"" (2014 release; 100 min.) brings the story of Jay and her friends as Jay is battling ""it"". As the movie opens, in the pre-opening credits scene we see a teenage girl running out of a house, in obvious terror of something that seems to be following her. She drives off in a panic and later we see her mutilated body. After the opening credits, we get to know Jay, another teenage girl, and her group of friends. Eventually Jay and her boyfriend have sex in his car, and that is when stranger things start to happen. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience , you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the second full-length feature from writer-director David Robert Mitchell, and this time he gives us a scary movie worthy of that name. This is MILES away from so-called scary (but in reality violence-porn) movies like the Saw franchise. Instead this movie is reminiscent of the ol' style John Carpenter movies. In fact, it is no accident that ""It Follows"" has a strong 1970s-1980s vibe (lots of old cars from that era, no cell phone, no internet, no cable TV, etc.). The movie is set in and around Detroit, and the city feels like it is playing a character itself in the movie. Check out the scene where the group of 5 kids is driving through one of the more harrowing parts of Detroit, seemingly a post-apocalyptic area, and later the Detroit Swimming building. Kudos to Maika Monroe in the leading role of Jay. I saw her most recently in ""Labor Day"" but here she brings an outstanding starring performance as vulnerable Jay. I couldn't help but be reminded of a young Cloe Sevigny. Last but certainly not least, there is an outstanding electronic soundtrack, composed and performed by Disasterpeace (the stage moniker of Rich Vreeland), which is equally worth seeking out.

After months of internet buzz and other hype, the movie finally opened nationwide this past weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it, even though as such I am not a big fan of 'scary' movies. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great, which surprised me (I had expected a lot more people in the theater). It doesn't matter. ""It Follows"" lives up to the hype, and then some. One of the better scary movies I have seen in a long, long time. If you have a chance to see ""It Follows"", be it in the theater, or eventually on Amazon Instant Video or DVD/Blu-ray, do not miss it. ""It Follows"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1427760000,2,2491,4.558035714285714
7084367,5,B00VAVNN5W,"Review based on what I saw in theaters. Not sure how a film that wears so many influences on it's sleeve can be so fresh. I enjoyed the soundtrack, which was composed/performed by Disasterpiece who is best known for their work on the FEZ soundtrack. Jonathan Carpenter, David Lynch, Stephen King, Alfred Hitchcock, Phillip K. Dick, and Todd Hido can all be cited as influences. I immediately noticed how the cinematography reminded me of Todd Hido's photographic work and was thrilled to see the director cite him as an inspiration. This film is something that I wish I would have thought up and created. It captures the simplicity of urban myth and personal nightmares yet manages to subtly introduce subtext in without banging it over the audience's head.

I'll be buying this on Blu Ray as soon as I can.",1427760000,2,807,4.764285714285714
7084368,4,B00VAVNN5W,"Theatrical review.  Possible spoilers.  I'm still trying to sort things out in my head about the events in this movie.  I'm close to giving up because I'm not sure the director/writer, David Robert Mitchell expects the audience to see a tidy conclusion.  This is surely a horror film by any standard, but it isn't a slasher film either.  There are a couple gory scenes but the camera doesn't linger.  Having said that, the movie is scary as hell.

In the opening scene we see a young woman running out of her house in her underwear.  She ends up sitting on a beach and later we see her dead with her body gruesomely altered.  In any movie, the first thing I'm looking for is the setting.  Maybe it's just me but I like to establish the context of where the story is taking place.  So I'm looking for clues.  Usually you get this from the cars, license plates, clothing, appliances, what's on TV or movies in the background.  I thought I had it figured out because there were a lot of late 70's or early 80's cars being driven.  But then I see some type of clamshell device that allows one of the characters to read a book.  Then I see a more modern (90's-00's pickup truck).  Are these just set errors?  I don't think so.  I think Mitchell has this planned.  Just like the creepy synthesized music from Rich Vreeland, eerily reminiscent of John Carpenter's ""Halloween.""  As are some of the street scenes with wind-blown trees bordering a quiet suburban neighborhood closing in on darkness.  These elements grab, right off the bat.

Jay Height (Maika Monroe, ""The Guest"") is a typical 19 year old college student.  She's living at home with her younger sister, Kelly (Lili Sepe).  Kelly's friends Paul (Keir Gilchrist) and Yara (Olivia Luccardi) hang out a lot.  In a couple scenes we see the teens watching an old 1954 film called ""Killers from Space.""  And in another juxtaposition, the film is seen on a 30 year old TV sitting on top of another ancient TV console.  Jay has had a few dates with a guy she met named Hugh (Jake Weary) and has decided that if the mood is right, she might go all the way.  They are going to a movie in town and in another amusing twist, are watching ""Charade"" from 1963 with no inkling that it's in retro.  Suddenly, Hugh feigns illness and insists they must leave.  In actuality he's seen a woman in the theater that he's afraid of.  Very afraid.

They head for the beach, talk a little and go back to his car (80's vintage GM I think).  In another way this film differentiates itself from other teens-in-danger horror flicks is that the sex is actually somewhat romantic.  Well, as romantic as you can get in the back seat of a car anyway.  Hugh's post coitus actions are problematic however.  He goes to the trunk, comes back and chloroforms the girl.  When she wakes up, Jay is tied to a wheelchair.  Hugh calmly explains that he's been hounded by ""It"" which can take many forms including loved ones.  ""It's"" goal is to kill you.  He's now been spared, at least temporarily, because he's passed on the curse by having sex with Jay.  He warns her of how the slow-walking demon may approach and tells her to have sex again with someone else and the curse will be passed on to him.  Hugh also tells Jay that if she is killed, ""It"" will reverse itself and go after him again.  No mention of whether a condom should or shouldn't be used but I guess not.  Certainly a metaphor for an STD, Jay is reluctant.

With help from Jay's sister and friends and the cute boy across the street, Greg (Danniel Zovatto), they dodge and ditch ""It"" even if no one can see ""It"" but Jay.  This film is brilliantly constructed from the perspective of using haunting sets, creepy music and long-lens shots to depict classic horror films of a previous era.  It sometimes falls short on logic (walking barefoot across broken glass) and lacks a concrete rationale on ""It's"" rules.  Does ""It"" only go after the most recent victim of the curse or all that follow?  There is also a pool scene toward the end of the film which comes from a plan hatched by Paul that falls on its face before it begins.  Still, I loved the film.  It is nightmare inducing, mysterious and confounding, all at the same time.  Highly recommended.",1427673600,2,4229,4.490144546649145
7084369,5,B00VAVNN5W,"If you have a love for simplistic, slow, and subtle horror movies that are permeated with absolute dread then you will enjoy this movie. It Follows' premise is the nightmarish story of a girl who is constantly followed by a murderous entity that can look like anyone. Though a simple concept, the movie's execution of creating an entity that does absolutely nothing but walk towards you is minimalisticly unsettling. Instead of a masked killer slowly following teens as we've seen before, the movie breathes new life into this concept and it makes for a patiently terrifying experience. The music is an unrelenting pulsing electronic orchestration that is both a mix of contemporary sound and 70's horror scores.

In addition, the setting and production design is reminiscent of the late 70's though it takes place in this era, which shows how the movie draws inspiration from horror classics without ever being tongue-in-cheek. There's much more for me to say about both its metaphorical and classically terrifying power, but not without spoiling details. Watch this small but great horror movie before it leaves a theater near you. Especially if you appreciate atmospheric anxiety and fear of the unknown. It Follows does for strangers in public what Marble Hornets did for forests and what Psycho did for showers.",1427587200,3,1316,5.120930232558139
7084370,5,B00VAVNN5W,"The film follows Jay (Maika Monroe), a young, friendly, and genuinely happy girl. One night Jay goes on a date with a young man and the two end up having sex. Upon doing so she gets knocked out. When she awakens, it is revealed to her that it has not been transferred to her. She is told that it will continue to haunt her unless she passes it on. However, if the person who currently has it is killed by it, the person prior will also die and continue down the line. Jay then begins to find herself being stalked by mysterious presences. She then enlists the help of her friends in order to help escape the curse.

It Follows is written and directed by David Robert Mitchell. Id read a great amount of buzz about this film and I became extremely excited for it. The film did not disappoint at all. The story is an extremely cool concept. It takes the idea of sexual activity and the diseases along with it and flips it. The film is truly terrifying in that there is so much that is left unknown. We only get a vivid idea of what it is, but we are left just as clueless as Jay. It is because we are left with this unknown feeling that help make the film extremely terrifying. The whole film kept me on the edge of my seat with many intense and scary moments.

I won't reveal any of these moments because they have to be seen in order to be felt. The presences that Jade sees are much more terrifying than I expected, a lot of this is due to how they are presented. Again, I won't reveal exactly what makes them terrifying, because again, it has to be seen to understand. It is essentially something almost out of someones nightmare (ironically Mitchell was inspired to make the film because of a nightmare he had).

We are also given a group of VERY likable characters. Jay is an extremely likable lead and we really become connected to her and hope she makes it out okay. She is also played amazingly by Maika Monroe. Monroe is truly a discovery and a very talented actress whom I hope to see more of in horror. Hell, more of in general. The friends that the character Jay has are also extremely likeable. They come off a realistic and they are hands down the most dependable friends Ive seen in a horror film. More often than not, the friends will believe the lead is crazy and don't believe her. Here, they stand by Jay throughout the whole film and do what they can to help her.

Each of the actors provide great comedic timing with some of their lines, and you can really feel the chemistry amongst the group. Just a brilliant cast and performances. One thing that I just marveled at during the film was the EXCELLENT score. I cannot stress enough how amazing it is. Its so perfectly used in the scenes and also what makes the scenes so chilling. It gave me the same feel as the scores of Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street and some of Texas Chain Saw Massacre combined with Suspiria.

Luckily I was able to catch an early screening of it at the Fargo Film Festival a whole week before its actual release. The producers did a Q&A after the screening and revealed that a lot of their inspiration for the film as far as its atmosphere and tone and filming style came from classics like Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, and Scream. This I agree with wholeheartedly, I could totally sense elements of each of these films in it. Which also added to one of the reasons I genuinely loved the film. It Follow is easily the best original horror film Ive seen in a LONG time. It is genuinely scare, has some good laughs, great characters and story, and solid performances. It is a film that will definitely stay with you after you see it.

7084371,4,B00VAVNN5W,"This is clearly going to be a very divisive movie. There are some people who seem to be utterly amazed by this film, and others who will claim they fell asleep. Hearing both of those statements already, I have to wonder if we watched the same movie? I found it very enjoyable and original. The concept is pretty brilliant in it's simplicity. Compared to many modern horror movies, it definitely has throwback qualities and spends more time on suspense than violence and gore. The acting is good. The setting is perfect. The soundtrack is great. It's nice to see kids in a horror movie that don't live in mini mansions on perfectly manicured streets. That bit of reality itself is refreshing. That being said, the film is flawed. It's difficult to elaborate on that without giving spoilers, so instead I'll just say the movie's biggest flaw....the hype. This is being WAY over hyped. Yes, it's creepy, it's somewhat original, and it's a fun movie. However, it's not a masterpiece. Not even close. Seeing reviews proclaiming it ""the scariest movie of 2015"" when it's only March....well, what is that about? ""The best horror film of the decade."" Hardly. It's one of the better ones, for sure, but if it's the best....we can go ahead and close the door on the genre, I'd say.
 I think this a movie that *most* horror fans will at least enjoy, but proceed with caution, because the hype this movie is getting is going to elicit some serious backlash before long. It's just not the all out scare-fest that the marketing machine is proclaiming. Horror films that are anything better than mediocre seem to be lavished with praise these days (the same thing just happened with ""The Babadook""), which is a pretty sad indication of where horror is at these days. That being said, ""It follows"" is a good movie, but it's not half as scary or groundbreaking as the quote covered posters would lead you to believe. It might have been better off being a sleeper hit, because this hype is it's ultimate downfall. A lot of people are going to be underwhelmed, I know I was, and that's unfair to a movie that deserves to be seen without expectations.",1427500800,5,2131,4.682666666666667

7084373,5,B00VAVNN5W,"""It Follows"" is easily one of the best horror movies you'll likely see this year. Instead of using the same cheap and cliched scare tricks that most mainstream horror films offer, this one instead creates tension with an amazing musical score, great atmosphere/camera direction, and a story with loads of suspense reminiscent of classic horror films like ""The Evil Dead"", and ""Halloween"".This is truly one of the most original and creative horror films in years. Highly recommended.",1427500800,2,482,5.2727272727272725
7084374,5,B00VAVNN5W,"WOW. Put simply, that was the single thought running through my head as I left the crowded screening of It Follows. I noticed a distinct haze of uncertainty hanging over the throng of people leaving the theater, none of them fully realizing or understanding what they just saw. But luckily, I was there in a sense that they werent. I connected, and knew what I witnessed. Something odd. Something out of the ordinary. A horror experience that doesnt come along often. Not one without flaws, just one with more interesting ideas at play than your average scary movie. Infused with a synth, electronic soundtrack that gets your blood pumping long before the characters, it quickly finds its own creepy rhythm and entrances you from then on.

The story is pretty straightforward, that is, once you know what you're dealing with (even if the characters dont). A twenty-something girl is involved in a sexual encounter and, due to this, is followed by an unknown force that wants her dead. This force is passed on from person to person strictly through sexual means, and is the only way to get rid of the threatening presence. Unlike most films of the same genre, we have no idea where it could go. Its unpredictable in every sense of the word and keeps the audience guessing throughout.

One thing I really admired about it was its intimate nature. Most horror films tend to stand back a bit and let the audience be a mere bystander. However, It Follows does the exact opposite. The viewer is right there with the main characters as the action unfolds, never feeling disconnected. We know these people, and feel for them as such. David Robert Mitchell shows great strength as a director - harkening us back to John Carpenter and other horror masters - but bringing a natural flair of his own that will transfix and mystify.

7084388,5,B00VAVNN5W,"RELEASED IN 2014 and written & directed by David Robert Mitchell, It Follows chronicles events in the Detroit area when a group of suburban youths have to contend with a strange curse spread through loose sex wherein the victim is followed by some THING, unless s/he passes the curse on to someone else.

This movie shows what a talented filmmaker can do with only $2 million, a competent no-name cast and a brilliant composer (Rich Vreeland). In tone & quality the movies akin to 2008s From Within, but more haunting and less talky, not to mention without the awkwardly overt commentary on Christian legalism vs. wicca. The film scores good marks in the female department with Bailey Spry (Annie in the prologue), Maika Monroe (Jay) and Lili Sepe (Kelly); Olivia Luccardi too (Yara).

COMMENTARY ON MAIN THEME (Dont read until you see the movie): The premise isn't juvenile at all, as some clueless critic suggested. In fact, it reflects real life as the potentially fatal curse for loose sex is akin to venereal disease, albeit spiritually rooted. It's the casual-sex-equals-death motif of slasher flicks but deeper. The monster in the movie represents the repercussions of meaningless sex, which may be physical, psychological or spiritual, but there is a price to pay. Two of the characters are childhood friends and their union is the antithesis of casual. Note the subtle yet potent climax.

In addition, there are interesting subthemes to be gleaned, like the safe suburbs vs. the danger of the rundown inner city.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hours & 40 minutes and was shot in Detroit and the surrounding region (Sterling Heights, Berkley, Northville, Troy and Clawson,).

All we and Jay (Miaka Monroe) know is, it is a slow walking zombie type movement thing that will follow you on foot, if it grabs you it can (and wants to) kill you, and you can temporarily have it out of your life by sleeping with someone else, who it will then be after.  But if it kills them, or the person they sleep with, it will start backtracking down the chain and eventually get back to you.  It can take on the form of anyone, a complete stranger or your best friend, relative whoever.

To be honest I think that the lead character, her sister (Lili Sepe) and some others being very attractive probably helps you stay interested in the slow moving plot.  The film does have you wondering what you'd do. Sure you could sleep with a prostitute, they'd obviously pass it on perhaps before even experiencing it, but they are likely to get killed pretty quickly and you're unlikely to ever know.  Your best bet would be to sleep with someone famous (that's unlikely so probably someone you know if they get killed), with great survival skills who is appealing to others so they can pass it up a chain whenever they have to, but you'll know when it's back to them.

Would living on a boat anchored out at sea or something protect you?  Or can this thing swim or walk on the sand at the bottom and still get you?  Volunteer and train for that trip to Mars while it is up the chain and hope you take off before it gets back to you.

My wife and I found the climax of the film to be quite nonsensical. We felt it was bad character writing on all fronts and that the sequence was just not edited very compellingly. It really takes away from the movie as a whole.

If you go into it expecting an underwhelming climax you may enjoy it a bit more -- or you may not find the climax underwhelming at all. Would give this 3.5 stars if possible because we quite enjoyed the ending of the movie itself and what we as viewers can infer from it.

Except the twist here is, not having any twist. Awkward! The movie takes its own slightly brain-damaged concept fully seriously, and you know, that even works despite itself (not on the first death which got a laugh from me). It's done weirdly enough to escape corniness. Where it never succeeds is a story arc: while most horror flicks suffer from too much exposition, this combines unreliable exposition with bad actors, yielding very haphazard results. The kids don't really know what's going on; you don't know what's going on. Owing to the self-consciously throwback directing style -- lotsa whirling pan-around shots -- and thematic mash-up of everything from ""Nightmare on Elm St."" to ""Ringu"" to ""Evil Dead"" all the way to ""Fright Night"" and ""Monster Squad"" I was 90% sure of this ultimately unfolding as the hipster answer to ""Scream"" or ""Cabin In The Woods"" i.e. a send-up of overly ""rules""-based horror tropes, but replacing the witty, telegenic, plastic stereotype characters with pimply losers who barely avoid maiming each other. My theory was wrong. Instead they reliably plod along with each ludicrous plan they cook up (realistic in a really dull way, I guess?). After 15 basically extraneous minutes at the beginning, it gets more interesting, just not necessarily coherent in plot or characterization.

7084417,4,B00VAVNN5W,"The overall premise of this movie is very good and very interesting.  It was a unique spin on a young person, in this case, a beautiful girl, being stalked by a supernatural force, and it had the potential to equal that of some of the A-list horror flicks like the first ""The Grudge"" or the ""Final Destination"" franchise.  Unfortunately, this was clearly a low budget film.  There was limited CG use in this film, with the ""It"" mostly portrayed by human actors behaving in a creepy way that made them seen inhuman.  Still, overall, this was a good b-list horror flick!
My only issue with this film was they never provided an explanation of what ""It"" was or why it was stalking those it was.  Instead, the film focuses solely on the act of the creature or ghost stalking its victims and their efforts to escape it.  The audience really learns nothing about the entity itself, except that its focus can be passed to another person and that once it kills the person of its current focus, it turns its attention back to the last person who it targeted, the one that passed it to person it killed.  Other than that, the being or demon remains a mystery throughout the entire film.  This may have been deliberate, with the film makers hoping for a sequel.  However, I would still have liked to learn a little more about what ""It"" was supposed to be and why ""It"" was doing what it was.

The acting is descent. The movie itself is very well done.  I want express my distaste for the actual ""monster"" of this movie. It feels like the plot of the movie is: kids party, fall in love, and then enter bad consequences aka ""monster"". Taking responsibility for your actions is one thing but the writers for this movie decided it had to be a morphing entity that follows because you had sex with someone whom was affected or cursed and the only way to pass it or cure it was to sleep with someone else...in other words a STD ghost. I find the idea of an entity following you because you slept with someone is like trying to scare kids into following the rules or bad things will happen.

A good rename would be ""STG: Sexualy Transmitted Ghost."" This is a movie about watching a sexually transmitted infection take on human form and slowly walk towards the main character. Most of this movie is watching someone walk. I assume this is supposed to build tension, I just found it annoying. I finished watching this film because I kept hoping something would happen, and I would have settled for anything other than walking.

Given the plot of being killed by an STG, one would assume there'd be some moral decisions to make about passing on the STG. If there were, none of the characters cared, or the actors/writers/director simply couldn't communicate that through words or actions.

I didn't like the characters. I didn't care when they died. I didn't care when they faked being afraid. I just wanted them to stop running away from the slowly walking STG so it would kill them and the movie would end.

7084475,1,B00VAVNN5W,"Allow me to begin my stating that I am a huge fan of pretty much everything the horror genre has to throw at audiences: gore, B movie plots, banal humor and even actresses just there for the obviously titillating visual appeal.  I have immensely enjoyed movies ranging from ALL the Friday the 13th franchise constituent parts (including Jason X) to Grindhouse flicks like ""Driller Killer"" and classic drive-in horror movies like ""I Drink Your Blood.  Heck, I even think Killer Klowns From Outer Space is worth getting on Blu-Ray.  Horror films are as diverse and sometimes bizarre as a phonebook is thick.  That is part of what makes them so fun.  It truly takes work to make a poor horror film.

Despite that preface, It Follows does not even deserve a seat at the horror table.  (Or even the card table in the other room, for that matter.)

Between mystifyingly poor directing and casting decisions, bizarre dialogue and unoriginal cinematography, this film ranges somewhere in between an obtuse after school special and a vague attempt to be Cloverfield original.  (And my sincere apologies to both of those formats for mentioning them in the same breath as this disaster.)  The only thing truly horrific about this film is the alleged acting.  The only reality I had to suspend was in my belief that this at some point had to have a writer who ostensibly went to school for that sort of thing.  My best description of this would be that it is a, The Grudge-meets-all-the-worst-scenes-from-movies-like-Last-House-On-The-Left montage, but without the plot.

If you are looking for an entertaining evening of watching a graphic sexual assault followed by 90 more minutes of a woman passing on her euphemism for a sexually communicable disease, then look no further.  You found it.

I am amazed that this is billeted as, The scariest movie of 2015 and critically acclaimed on the packaging.  Please feel free to see for yourself if we have gotten to the point where someone, somewhere, will say something good about anything for money.

The only thing that follows this film is that it will sit on my shelf while I never watch it again.  Please save your money.

Oh, but the steelbook itself looks nice.  Unfortunately, I will use it as an end piece on the shelf to protect my other steelbooks from damage.",1487721600,,2306,4.834183673469388
7084476,4,B00VAVNN5W,"Some movies simply put me to sleep. Sergio Leone's ""Dollars Trilogy"" is a great example of one where it took a few separate viewing to make it through. It Follows turns out to be another.

I don't know if it is the leisurely pace, the lack of action, or the nebulous antagonist but it worked like a knockout gas on me. The movie's premise is actually quite good. If you sleep with someone an unstoppable monster will chase you until you sleep with someone else and then they will chase them and so forth.

The solution to such a curse seems fairly straightforward, particularly for an attractive blonde teen girl. Go to a swingers club in say Las Vegas. Since the monster moves at a simple walking pace by the time it reaches Vegas you will have twenty or so partners at the very least ahead of yourself.

Alas, it wouldnt be a horror movie if the characters spent five minutes thinking of a logical way out their predicament. So instead she and her Scooby gang spend the movie making sure the monster can find them.

The movie has some very effective scenes and set pieces. It is certainly not a bad film at all. The mixing of styles and technology give a dreamy sense out of time. The acting is naturalistic. I think maybe I am just too old for the movie.

For example one of the main characters is the childhood friend who holds a torch for the protagonist and who has stuck by her side as she has dated others who use her and throw her away while he sits from afar and painfully pines. I am old enough to recognize this as a classic nice guy. I am also old enough to understand this is a fate worse than any monster.

7084484,3,B00VAVNN5W,"This movie has so much going for it in the beginning.  The art direction with its juxtaposition of elements from the 50's through the present day is subtly and disturbingly disorienting and captures the feeling of a dream perfectly.  And there's no attempt to explain it, which helps it work so well.  The idea of the thing that follows is very creepy, very nightmarish, and wonderfully rendered by the arresting appearances of the various actors who portray it.  And there's no attempt to explain it, which helps it work so well.

Unfortunately, after doing such a great job presenting all this promising material, the director then loses his way.  At a loss for how to develop this very effective and compelling material he falls back on the tired formula of having his characters try to figure out how to defeat the thing, and it all goes wrong (the story, I mean.)

This movie is one of the best examples I've seen of a recent trend among makers of horror films, a trend toward trying to make the horrible element of the story believable, tangible, explicable.  And that's a mistake.  If you're telling me a horror story you don't want to dilute the horror by defending its plausibility.  That ruins the effect!  You can't give me a rational explanation for the supernatural and then expect me to be frightened by it.  And the goal of a horror movie should be--and I feel very strongly about this--to scare the crap out of the audience.

As soon as the makers of ""It Follows"" default on the plot and have the characters try to defeat the supernatural creature they end up with a silly, distracting paradox concerning its selective visibility, it's ability to interact with the environment, etc.  Something which in the beginning of the film could only be seen by those who had been cursed by its unwanted attention--which, indeed, only existed for those people, which is a basic terror for all of us--that alienation of being the only one who sees a monster--suddenly becomes merely invisible to the others, but perfectly capable of smacking them around.  Oh, and you can shoot and hurt it, but you have to shoot it a lot.  Oh, and its afraid of being electrocuted.  So now I'm not scared.

In the sequel please do not try to explain too much (or any) back strory. Dont need to know about how the ""It"" came to be, how strong it is, or vulnerable in any way. The unknown makes it better.
For instance, as a viewer I wonder if person 1 passes ""it"" to person 2 and while person 2 still lives, can person 1 still pass ""it"" to a person 3 and so on or is it just a one person at a time system? As a fan I'm interested to know the answer, however, the more I know about this shapeshifting sex monster the more limited it becomes. Better to dance around answering questions like this. Keep it unknown. People fear what they don't know.
Great job with the timeless nature of the set pieces and decor. The seashell poetry reading device, cell phone call and automobiles are the only items that can allow us to place a date on when the story takes place. I appreciate this artistic choice. I feel it is wise because then people can easily watch this 10-50 years from now and enjoy the story without technologies distracting from the character development or plot.

Don't go into this one thinking that there will be kills every few minutes and a blaring metal soundtrack...If you liked The Babadook and you like The Witch, you will like, It Follows. It is a tension filled nail biter set in a bleak Midwestern town which almost looks abandoned.

7084521,2,B00VAVNN5W,"OK, I kind of wanted to see this movie based on all the hype, but still refrained. Then it was recommended by someone's opinion I trust, so I gave it a shot.

I will start off by saying that I did like it to an extent. It had a great early day horror movie vibe to it, mixed with an eighties vibe, which is cool and I appreciate. But there are so many odd choices the writer-director made.

Number one, a lot of the lighting throughout the movie looks like exactly what it is; A single or multiple studio lighting positioned in such a way as to light the centerpiece or focus of the scene. There are several scenes where you can clearly see the downward cone shape of the light coming from the fixture, as if an alien spaceship were above about to abduct whatever was being lighted. I even think during one scene I saw one of the lights dim or go out as a car drove away.

The dialogue isn't natural, for most of the movie. There are just certain questions that would be asked in certain circumstances that would demand an answer, but no one in the movie ask the right questions nor gives the right answer if, by chance the right question were posed.  Secondly, the actors weren't the greatest, the conversations weren't as fluid or natural as typical conversation. A lot of delays between the actors responding to a simple hey,or how's it going.

The kids in this movie also seem to be lacking parents or the help of police officers, for 95% of the movie.

(Spoiler...kind of)
 Finally, so I don't ramble on and on,  The end was odd.  At the end the kids form a plan to try and defeat the threat  but the logic behind why they think it would work was never stated and the plan was never followed through with, even though they had AMPLE! opportunity to follow through with the plan. AMPLE OPPORTUNITY!

 As I'm sitting here writing this, I think I just realized why I don't usually watch horror movies, because in order for most horror movies to work, the characters need to be kind of stupid, otherwise they would never give the threat a run for their money long enough for us to enjoy the movie and they'd escape the danger somewhat quickly.

 Having said all that, I actually did enjoy the movie for casual viewing when I had nothing better to do, but I'd be unlikely to recommend it or watch it again ever.",1481068800,,2311,4.356643356643357

It is very disappointing that amazon has chosen to make movies available in some regions but not in others.

Very disappointing.

I can add up other lists of dissatisfying elements with my amazon prime account, such as some items being eligible for ""free shipment"" but not other...that is a huge one.  So I will be not be renewing my subscription to amazon prime.

This year, based on reviews and worrd of mouth, we started our horror movie marathon with IT FOLLOWS. An interesting premise borrowing a little style and substance from Carpenter-esque stalking films of yesteryear.
The film started off in good fashion and the first half is pretty creepy, however the third act really lacks in amping up said terror, and the end leaves you uninformed and scratching your head.
Based on the myriad of good reviews and deep speculation as to what it means and what ""IT"" is, I'm not sold. The theme of the film is not really thought provoking. To me, a biased and seasoned viewer of film, the creators had a sound premise, but story and explaination was lacking because they simply did not have one. The rules of what IT is and what IT does were slapshod. The faults of this flick come down to the one thing - a weak script.
The shame in that is that with some great lighting, a cool location, and some fantastic music you still can't have an awesome movie if the story is muddled.

It Follows lacks gore, nudity, scares, and never really explains what ""It"" is at all. What were left with is an empty shell of a want to be original horror film that never delivers the goods. The beginning was somewhat intriguing, but went downhill fast. Also, this joke of a film had one of the lamest endings I think I've ever seen! I'm shocked this film has any 5 star ratings on Amazon. It just goes to show what rubbish will pass as horror in 2016. The whole concept was original I suppose, but the execution was weak as hell. Bottom line is that 95% of horror movies from the last 15+ years are complete crap. And It Follows only goes to support that argument.",1473724800,,803,4.254901960784314
7084568,1,B00VAVNN5W,"I thought this was supposed to be ""the scariest movie of 2014"". The only good thing about it was the music, which was somewhat reminiscent of the music in phantasm (1979 version). It wasn't remotely scary. Pretty much no suspense. No plot worth speaking of. There was a lot of sleeping in the movie, which is how I felt after about 10 minutes. 97% on rotten tomatoes? I find that hard to believe. Definitely aimed at a teen audience.
I was robbed! I would have given it zero or negative stars if that was an option. I understand they plan to make a sequel. Please, don't bother! Oh, and filming a horror movie in Detroit? Wow, I bet no-one's ever thought of doing that before!",1473638400,,676,4.416

7084595,5,B00VAVNN5W,This film was amazing. It is one of the first actually terrifying movies I have seen in a long long time.  The movie is paced well and builds tension with ease. There are no lags in the story.,1471392000,,192,4.052631578947368
7084596,4,B00VAVNN5W,"I *think* I understand It Follows.  It's pretty confusing for the first 30%.  However the film has tremendous atmosphere, good acting and a decent story so that's why I stayed with it.  Whether you find this type of movie frightening is a matter of taste.

At first we see a young girl running around outside her house scared of something.  She keeps turning around and looking at something but we can't see what it is.  Her neighbors and father ask if everything's okay.  She says she's fine but clearly she's disturbed!  After briefly entering the house she suddenly grabs the car keys, runs outside and leaves home only to end up near the beach.  She's still frightened.  In the next scene she's dead with her legs broken and ripped (off?) while her legs are hanging in the air.  Certainly a strange way to open a movie!

Now the actual story gets going, though it took me about 30 minutes to realize it.  Maika Monroe's character goes on a date with a guy (Jake Weary's character) to a movie theater.  While waiting in line they play a game called ""Point to the person you'd like to be"".  At first the game is innocent enough.  The guy points to a child because he'd like to be a kid again.  He gave a good explanation here that I can't remember.  Something about having a parent protect him.

When the two sit down and watch the movie they continue playing the game  Jake points to a woman in a yellow dress up in the balcony... who isn't there, which freaks Maika out.  Suddenly Jake becomes sick so they leave the movie theater.  In the next scene Maika is alone and goes swimming for a while- pretty creepy and quiet atmosphere here.  When the two go on a date again Maika's in the backseat lying on her stomach, with the door open and picking at the weeds on the ground.  She discusses typical stuff that teens discuss while on a date, however rather shockingly Jake sneaks up behind Maika pretending to make out with her only to take a rag and suffocate her nostrils.  Why Jake!

Maika wakes up tied to a chair in the middle of an abandoned building.  Jake says several weird things that make no sense at all at this early point in the story.  Suddenly a naked woman walks up a nearby hill.  Decent atmosphere since it's nighttime so we're only able to get a glimpse of her.  Jake says stuff like ""Don't let her get you"" (not word for word of course).  She freaks out.  This isn't a regular naked woman- this is a demonic entity!  Here's the key part of the story- when one teen has sex with another, they pass on demons or ghosts that follow them whenever they go.  In this case Maika's the next victim.  Yup these are sexual monsters.  Most of the time they're invisible, but the story here is that Maika now has to run for her life to try and escape them.  So THIS is why teens shouldn't have sex, haha.

A little strange for a movie concept, but I like it.  I can work with it at least, even if the execution is confusing initially.  We see Maika trying to have normal teenage conversations with her friends throughout the movie only for a demon or ghost to make a surprise visit that only she can see.  She of course freaks out, cries, screams and tries to run away.  Really good suspense and an original idea for a horror, so I'm intrigued!

Some people might think the story moves too slow but I say this isn't an issue because the atmosphere maintains a creepy pace the entire way.  Probably the most memorable scene (besides the final 10 minutes at a swimming pool) is when Maika is having a conversation with her friend on the living room couch when suddenly the kitchen window breaks.  Maika knows what's going on but her friend does not- he thinks it's an intruder or someone playing a game by breaking windows and running away.  When he leaves the room for a moment leaving Maika alone, she slowly walks around and... sees a female demon approaching Maika with her breasts out!

She freaks out, runs to her bedroom and locks the door.  Her friends beg her to open and when she does a really tall man approaches her one female friend who's standing in the doorway from behind.  REALLY creepy moment there!  But only Maika can see these demons.  Nobody else can.  This is why her friends can never understand what she's screaming at, but like good friends they believe something is there.  They don't automatically assume she needs therapy.  The great atmosphere continues when Maika runs away to a playground and sits on a swing.  We look through the trees and darkness awaiting another demon but... not this time.

But yeah the acting's good all around.  Keir Gilchrist, Daniel Zovatto, Olivia Luccardi, Jake Weary and Lili Sepe... all tremendous actors/actresses pertaining to their friend or relative roles.  The movie won't leave you guessing at the end either.  Even though it certainly *felt* like it would have an incomplete crappy ending because I've seen this song and dance before, no, surprisingly it's a great satisfying ending!  Perhaps it's questionable for some that a swimming pool would be the location to finish up the story but it makes perfect sense and I really like it.  In fact I love the final 20 minutes because the water helped make Maika's friend realize something really *is* there and Maika's not crazy.  Highly recommended.",1471132800,,5275,4.540913921360255

7084640,5,B00VAVNN5W,"I honestly wasn't expecting much with this movie but figured what the heck, its been a while since I tried a scary movie.  But it did not disappoint.

I don't want to spoil anything so I won't disclose any of the plot.  However, the movie is a great example of doing more with less ($$$). It didn't rely on excessive gore or quick thrills to make you jump out of your seat.  Rather, ""IT"" used a slow and methodical approach that was much harder to ignore- at least for me.

I saw through the Amazon X-Ray feature that the idea behind IT was based on a recurring nightmare the Director had as a child.  I had similar experiences in my sleep when I was a kid and this movie perfectly captured those feelings of helplessness and raw, primal fear.

I also liked that the movie wasn't full of moments where I could instantly pull myself out of the universe because a main character did something so totally cliche and obvious that I stop being afraid for them because I would never do that and I can't empathize with such obvious bad writing.  There wasn't much of that in this film.  At one point one character does charge into a home after IT breaks in to warn someone inside, and one character keeps falling asleep in painfully dangerous locations but I mean really how could you avoid that given the way IT stalks and kills you?  The last time I saw a horror film where I wasn't constantly facepalming the protagonists naivety or stupidity was Alien, but this one had a protagonist who made pretty consistent logical decisions given the circumstances she found herself in.  I can't tell you how much of a relief that is.

Ive never seen a horror film that I didn't have some complaints with at the end.  Its just par for the course.  But this one managed to get through that crucible without too much trouble and kept the story and plot rolling along just fine.  I also loved the atmosphere that the movie was set in.  I highly recommend It Follows to anyone looking for a really creepy movie.",1468022400,18,1992,4.431318681318682

My primary complaint concerns the last 15 minutes or so.  It seemed disjointed to me. Like the director ran out of money and just threw whatever he had leftover at the ending. And why did a gun kill the monster in the pool(I know, it really didn't or maybe didn't), but had little effect at the beach. Also, who decided electricity might kill It.

7084652,3,B00VAVNN5W,What it lacked in plot it made up for in suspense. The stalker/monster didn't have any kind of lore behind it only oddly specific rules. It would have been interesting if the kids were able to uncover more backstory but their investigatory efforts peter off rather quickly. To give credit where credit is due they make more of an effort than any of the police or adults who seem non-existent for the most part. The cursed girl grapples with the ethics involved in freeing herself from the curse by passing it on to others but to the guys in the film being stalked by a horrific monster doesn't seem like a bad trade off.,1467072000,,620,4.447368421052632

Certain films are able to capture an intangible essence/vibe that stays  with you for days after. Unfortunately this was, for me, not one of those films.

As a huge fan of the original Conjuring,  I had to watch, and was not disappointed.  This is a rare horror gem.  Atmospheric, timeless, engrossing, and deliciously unsettling.

Some movies make you afraid of the dark, leaving doors unlocked, or camping in the woods. This movie was geared to make a teenage audience afraid of having sex with new partners.

The first half was good. It had a unique story line and made me jump a few times. Towards the end it got a little slow and a little silly. The ending was a little lacking.

I just watched this movie last night on Showtime & I was very unsatisfied with it - I would probably give it 2.5 stars if I could - but it made me feel really uncomfortable. I know, it's supposed to it's a scary movie but I mean REALLY uncomfortable. For one, it had a retro vibe to it but it wasn't' a period movie. In other words, it had a 70's early 80's look but it wasn't set in that time frame. None of the kids in the movie had a cell phone, but one had a digital reader?

While the premise was good, a little preachy with the ""have sex & die"" story, which isn't unlike the 70's slasher movies, just more straight forward, I found myself really disliking the main character Jay & the guy who gave her ""It"" Hugh (Jeff). I didn't mind her friends but really didn't care when one of them died.

A girl you don't care about running away from just about everything trying to find the guy who did this to HER.

The young characters are excellent throwbacks to an earlier, more ""innocent"" time, when no one expected constant sarcasm or terminally cynical self-awareness. Maika Monroe is especially good as Jay, the girl who finds herself thrust into a terrifying, supernatural situation beyond her control. Bottom line: Don't expect a high-octane, shock-a-minute gore explosion! This is an homage to a time when horror movies were far more inventive and sincere.

I am a connoisseur of thriller and horror films and I am extremely discerning when it comes to movies that fall within those categories. Perhaps even picky to a fault, my options are often limited. Director David Robert Mitchell did a fantastic job at infusing the 70s horror aesthetic without making the film look kitschy or derivative. It Follows could be considered an homage to such films but it manages to showcase what makes it unique and worth viewing-- a lack of cheap thrills and compelling characters whose survival you actually root for.

For those of you (like myself) who love horror/thriller but live in fear of repeated and often tedious jump scares, this is a film you'll appreciate. A couple of my fellow viewers were disappointed in the ambiguity of the evil in the film, but I found that to be more unsettling and thus made for a better story. I also really appreciated the setting of (suburban) Detroit because this city is often overlooked in cinema and in life. The juxtaposition of quaint, suburban housing with dilapidated manors at one point in the film made the story more relatable and eerie.

I did like the music a lot but it's really not enough to save the movie.  it's basically a horror movie intended to scare teens into being or staying abstinent.  the story is very simple, a ""thing"" follows the person until they're killed by it or they pass it on which is only temporary.  by having sex you can make your sexual partner the newer target, but if the new target is killed then it reverts back to the previous person.  I thought it sounded cool but it just didn't work.  the ""thing"" can take the form of any person but I found none of the forms to be scary.

Jay Height is a college student in Michigan. The first date with her new boyfriend Hugh goes well, expect he seems freaked out by a girl he describes but Jay can't see. The second date, they have sex in Hugh's car. Jay feels wonderful about it, but Hugh knocks her out right afterwards. She wakes up still in her underwear tied to a wheelchair with Hugh rambling about someone who will follow her. A nude woman approaches her and Hugh seems satisfied, releasing her from her bonds and unceremoniously dumping her in front of her house. Jay reports the incident and tries to forget about it, but at night, someone breaks into her house, changes form, and chases her. She knows it's something more than the ravings of a madman and resolves to seek him out to get more answers.

It Follows is a complex horror film that made a big splash last year when it was released into mainstream theaters. Its strengths are its unique world and the varied subjective meanings of the film. The world it builds is a combination of modern and retro. Brand new cars are seen everywhere, but Jay's friend Greg drives an 80's style station wagon that they drive around for most of the film. Jay's house seems stuck in the 70's with its dated style, old horror and sci-fi TV shows and movies on their very old fashioned black and white TV. The synthesized score created by Disasterpeace calls to mind past soundtracks like John Carpenter's Halloween and Charles Bernstein's Nightmare on Elm Street. All of this coupled with the artfully filmed Detroit backdrop makes for a film that creates its own time, similar to the Bates Motel television show.

Many people have speculated at the meaning of the film and the Follower. The ones that dismiss it as the fear of sex or sexually transmitted diseases is simplistic and not looking at the whole picture. I think it's much more than that. Jay is 19 years old, not a high school student. She would be at least a few years younger and a virgin if it had been merely about fear in and punishment of having sex. Jay was building a relationship with Hugh (which wasn't even his real name). They got to know each other over a couple of dates and she chose to be intimate with him on their second date. Immediately afterwards, he assaults her, ties her to a wheelchair still in her underwear, and tells her about the Follower, a person who will slowly walk towards her in the guise of anyone. He tells her it isn't stupid and it will keep following forever unless she passes it on to someone else in the same way it passed it to her.

I interpret the Follower to be all of the consequences of sex. On the surface, it's pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease, but it's also other people's opinions and judgments. It's trusting that the other person is genuine in their intentions and being as close to them as you can possibly be. It's accepting that entering a long term relationship with someone is also assuming all of their baggage as well. The Follower takes many forms as the consequences do. Sometimes it takes on the form of loved ones because the closest people to you have the ability to hurt you the most. Jay is affected by the consequences more seriously than others because they tend to be more serious for women in our society. A woman's value is still tied to her sex life and public opinion about it whether perception matches her actions or not. Men don't have these same perceptions to combat. This is why ""Hugh"" has to build part of a relationship with Jay to have sex with her while Jay can just hop on a boat and presumably have sex with little to no speaking. Even when Greg is very flippant about the consequences, the Follower still kills him as it also presumably kills the men on the boat. The Follower is always there and always advancing to show that no one is exempt from these consequences.

Throughout the film, characters reminisce over being a child. During the game they play at the theater, ""Hugh"" wants to be a little boy with a whole future ahead of him. Paul, Jay's friend, reminisces over sexual exploration in his childhood. This particular incident is when he and Jay found porn magazines in the street and looked at them only to be caught by their horrified parents. They are remembering when they didn't have to deal with more than disappointed or freaked out parents. Now, their parents are absent because they are growing up. Their parents have other stuff to deal with and honestly can't really help them with these issues. Their parents can't change all of these consequences they are subject to. Paul also reminisces over first kisses that didn't really mean anything to him as a child, but he's obviously in love with Jay now. The same kisses mean something a lot different as adults. Growing up is a bit part of the film. All the main characters are college aged and they need to navigate their new found adulthood on their own.

Many complain that the Follower and its rules are inconsistent. At the beginning, a young woman is running away from it, but gives up and sits by the beach. She is found with her leg grotesquely bent backwards, almost severed from her body. Later on, it kills Greg in an entirely different, bloodless fashion. Tons of things are passed around by word of mouth with varying degrees of accuracy. For instance, even as adults, myths abound about pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases abound. Misinformation is everywhere, so of course not all the information being passed to Jay by ""Hugh"" is not going to be completely accurate. He is reporting his own findings based on his experience. The consequences of sex are different for each person, so why would they be the same in the form of the Follower?

The ending of the film has Jay and her friends trying to kill the Follower by luring it into a pool and electrocuting it. It of course doesn't go to well as the Follower isn't stupid. It appears to be dead as the pool fills with blood after Paul shoots it. Jay and Paul have sex and are seen walking down the street hand in hand, implying a new relationship. Someone follows them from behind, but they don't even look back. If  you're obsessed with all these negative consequences, it's consumes your life. Jay wouldn't even leave the house and couldn't lead a normal life when she was obsessed with it. Now, she has someone by her side that makes the consequences matter less. The Follower and what it represents are still there and will always be there, but for now, it doesn't matter. It doesn't bode well that Paul was obviously in love with her for a while and Jay was resistant to a relationship, but the last impression we are left with is happiness.

It Follows is an interesting horror film that's completely open to interpretation. If you have a different take, I would love to hear it. The filmmakers purposefully didn't give an definitive answers because they want it left that way and I appreciate that. It Follows is largely successful because of Maika Monroe as Jay. Her emotion onscreen is amazing and she kept me on her side the whole film, even when doing morally questionable things to stave off death. I highly recommend It Follows, but it's not for everyone.",1457049600,43,7198,4.599688473520249

7084843,5,B00VAVNN5W,"One of the best parts about this movie is the most subtle - it plays with your expectations.  Not in the standard horror film way, where they make you wonder whether the monster will jump out or not, but with your sense of time and distance.  For instance, it puts items from different technological levels beside each other, like mirror compact e-readers and crt screens, with no explanation.  The part where they were exploring the ex's old apartment also feels very dreamlike and disconnected.  The whole movie feels more like a nightmare than a real event.  If you've ever had a nightmare where something is chasing you but no one can help this is very similar.  The creature also moves at very different rates, although some of that is due to slow motion filming, like the scene in the kitchen.  There are few 'rules' to the creature, beyond 'it follows one person at a time' and even the characters fail to figure out how it operates, which is rare in a horror film.  It's a good idea to watch the movie a few times, to try to figure out which background characters could have been the creature.",1456185600,7,1101,4.553299492385787

Other than a relatively original premise (the reason I gave it two stars instead of one), this is a total train wreck of a movie. Four, at times five, teenagers are on screen most of the time, and what passes for a plot might have been written by a teen, and an unsophisticated one at that. The story meanders aimlessly here and there without much rhyme or reason. The main character, who is constantly on the lookout for someone following her, for some reason keeps gazing at the tops of trees, over and over again. Perhaps that is supposed to be symbolic but if so, I don't have any idea what it is symbolic of. Like most horror films, the sound is atrocious. First you have to turn the sound up to 60 (out of 100) to hear the dialogue, then the sound effects and/or music becomes so loud you have to turn it down to 15 to make it bearable.

Thats a lot to leave unexplained.

Also, since the killer apparently can only move around by walking, wouldnt flying to an island and staying there be a logical way to thwart the killer? Or, just have sex with a whole lot of people, so you keep the killer too busy to ever work its way back to you. Of course, that isn't a terribly moral thing to do since it creates a bunch of new victims, but the whole point of horror movies like this is that girls who have sex must be punished for their immoral nature. Really, isn't it time to get past that? Although, to be fair, boys who have sex get slaughtered too, so the killer is an equal opportunity slayer. Anyway, if It is following you, fly to Australia and have sex with lots of different people and your problem would seem to be solved.

7084936,4,B00VAVNN5W,"I had heard so many people raving about ""It Follows"", that I was actually a little hesitant about checking it out. The last horror film that I can remember with this much hype was ""Cabin in the Woods"", and when I finally got around to checking it out, I was a bit underwhelmed.

I finally rented ""It Follows"" on Prime this weekend, and I have to say I really enjoyed it. The film creates a new mythology, it's not a remake or a reboot of a familiar story, and best of all, it's not another PG-13 found footage film.

Jay is a young co-ed who finds herself cursed after a one night stand. It seems there is a demonic presence that will follow Jay, and kill her if it catches her. The only way to pass the curse along is to have sex with someone and then they become the demon's target.

There are some truly creepy scenes sprinkled throughout the film, and ""It Follows"" has plenty of creepy atmosphere. If your are looking for a bunch of jump scares, or an action packed horror film, you probably won't like this movie. If you want something that is a slow burn and a movie that pulls you in with it's creepy vibe, then give it a shot.",1451865600,16,1134,4.216589861751152
7084937,4,B00VAVNN5W,"There are so many reasons that make It Follows an astounding work of art. It truly is a brilliant film, and this brilliance is displayed in indirect ways throughout it. It brings forth an unconventional kind of horror. It doesnt rely on jump scares or gore but rather a perpetual state of anticipating doom. It Follows quenched my thirst for terror in a fresh way. That being said, this is a movie that gets better every time you watch it, because you know what you're looking for. You discover fresh points of symbolism and purpose with each viewing. Each time you watch it making a little bit more sense than the previous time. This movie radiates onto the audience an unusual atmosphere and mood, which is beautifully deliberate and premeditated. That is why I find such beauty in this film. It follows is unnatural and odd which creates a feeling of intense unease organically.

Lets take a look at the main things that make this film refreshing:

The time period seems to be incongruent, making the entire feel of the movie just like a nightmare. Nothing makes sense and its very mythic. The dream-like aura it projects creates an excellent sense of paranoia. We can see that there are discrepancies in the time period in a plethora of ways. The style of the clothes that the characters wear swings back and forth from being modern to vintage, you can't quite tell where their fashion sense is stemmed from. Everything that they watch on TV is either an outdated black-and-white monster movie or a vintage looking cartoon. Jay's kitchen has a 1970's feel to it while Greg's kitchen has a present-day stainless steel fridge. All of the television sets in the movie are old box sets with antennas and dials. The home decor that is displayed throughout seems to be very outmoded. The furniture, wallpaper, and decorations all seemed to be pulled from separate decades. There are also other subtle cues that there is no definite time period: All of the photos hung up in Jay's house are black and white, there are no cordless phones or signs of modern technology whatsoever  besides the whimsical clam shell e-reader, Jeff's mom looks completely 80s, and there are newer modern cars but there are also perfect condition vintage cars. Perhaps there are other obvious indicators of an imaginary universe that Ive missed but will notice in future reruns. Anyway, the fact that this time period doesn't exist is just incredibly bleak.

The It that follows the victim is just downright eerie. It can be in the form of anyone you know, or anyone you don't know, for that matter. Constantly keeping you in a state of panic, forever searching and waiting for It to show up. If you think about the It being able to replicate someone you know or love, it haunts you with a deep feeling of maliciousness. It is incredibly manipulative as it has disguised itself as a person you love to get close to you. It wants to deceive you in the nastiest way. It is mocking you. Since it can be in the form of anyone, you never really know who it could be. Is this person that is walking toward you just an innocent bystander or is it the persistent monster that you know is always around the corner coming for you. The victim is always riddled with this anxiety.  The scariest part is that you always know in the back of your mind that even if from a distance, the monster is on a straight perpetual path to get you. You really understand this fear in the classroom scene where Jay sees an old lady far off in the distance out of the window in the schools courtyard.  Jay soon realizes that the woman is walking directly towards her. The It is also never fully explained. It sticks with the rules that are explained in the beginning of the movie, but there is a certain mystery behind the meaning of it all. I like to think of it as a metaphor for running from something and this metaphor can be interpreted by the audience in the form of different ways. Id be curious to know what some other peoples theories on the hidden meaning behind it means to them. Ultimately, the victim is consistently running from time itself, which is inevitable. This period of consternation in always anticipating the Its appearance eventually exhausts the victim and gives them a stale existence. The victim becomes defeated and tired of life, tired of running, tired of being in a constant frenzy, tired of the unknown. Even though the victim can pass the curse to someone else, this still doesnt get rid of the dread or paranoia. Its just a matter of time. The victim is in a constant state of psychological torture and mental suffering. The symbolism of the fear of death and loss of innocence is apparent. The victim is tortured until the exact flash before their departure i.e.  Death. The moment when your soul is evacuated and you are no longer you, is the real fear. And even worse than that is that this is an unavoidable, absolute truth. Throughout the film you can feel the presence of It even when it isn't around because you're always anticipating the arrival. Some of the ways that the It looked physically were pretty startling to me as well. The one that stands out the most is when Jay is in her house and It appears behind her friend in the bedroom door. It is in the form of a bizarrely tall man with ominous eyes. Very disquieting to me as this man is almost an occult like figure. It taunts the victim in so many unconventionally terrifying ways. Another startling scene is when It is posed as a naked man on top of the roof. Jay tries to warn Greg that it is coming after him only for It to pause and glare at her before continuing its path toward the target. For me, this meant that it was trying to communicate with Jay, forever confirming that it is always and will still be coming for her. Ultimately, the slow walking pace is calculated, purposely inflicting hysteria up until the moments of death. Not to mention that It is sure to draw out the victims death, taking the time to enjoy the slaying, making sure the victim suffers up until their life is ceased.
The soundtrack is absolutely hair-raising and corresponds with the cinematography perfectly. The raucous score creates a narrow sense of calamity immediately from the opening scene. The harsh sounds are dismal, cold, and nervous-inducing. The music unravels as we watch the life of Jay and the other victims unravel right before our eyes.

The ending is just so completely grim. It is always coming for you. You are actively being hunted. Everyone around you could be an imposter. The mysteries of the curse are even more frightening than actually being followed. You become a vacuous being of anxious waiting, a skittish being flushed with paranoia, you become a callous monster just like It, passing death on to anyone else in hopes to buy yourself more time, only then to not know when it will appear again  In the shower, while you're sleeping, lurking in the distance in a crowd of faces. Youre trapped. The metaphor of this entire movie seems to become more tangible for me every time I watch it. That life is stale and constantly decaying. Our existence is of no use. There is no real purpose. We are aimless, but always longing for something. We all have the same fate, eventually, and the end will come to each and every one of us. There is no escaping conclusion.",1451779200,6,7323,4.601071975497703

You may argue that the movie is original, with the whole STC (sexually transmitted curse) but it is definitely not a good movie.  The movie starts out pretty slow and continues on that pace for the entire length of the movie.  Towards the end my brain couldn't take it anymore and completely shut down sending me into a movie induced coma for the remaining 15 minutes of the movie.  I finally regained consciousness during the credits and I asked my wife a question: what happened, did I miss anything?  Her answer pretty much summed it up: ""Nothing.""  I would typically try and get more information from her just to get an idea of what I really missed, but I really didn't feel like it.

Quite frankly, the premise sounded pretty juvenile and maybe even cringeworthy. I would never have pursued viewing this film without serious convincing.  But based on the well written review by the hipster journalist referenced above, I decided to give it a try.

And wow! What a surprise.  This is a cleverly done movie with a very moody and suspenseful atmosphere.  These apparently unknown actors are all really quite good and the settings definitely set the atmosphere that not so good things are soon to transpire.

I was glued to the screen from beginning to end.  And, although I wished for a stronger ending (no spoiler here, it is not bad.  Just slightly 'meh'), I think that overall this was indeed the best scary movie I saw in 2015.

And I'll just add that this is probably a very low budget movie.  I can't imagine that more than a few hundred thousand was spent on the production itself -- basically Michael Bay's Starbucks tab on any given heap that he works on.  And this is testament to the idea that fantastic movies can still be made on a budget.

In fact, I tend not to like horror movies at all, but, after reading the great reviews of this movie, I thought I would give it a try. It started out promising, and it had my attention from the start, and I thought it was going to be great. However, it began to drag and I began wishing for it to end already. There were a lot of plot holes and unexplained story lines; you never really know what this ""thing"" is, you never really know how it takes it's form, or why some people can see it right away while others don't see it until it kills them.

7084983,2,B00VAVNN5W,"Interesting premise, but was immediately bothered with the message it sends.  It felt geared towards teens.  The last thing teens need is another reason to have (unprotected and random) sex.  It was rated R, but it felt campy- like it was geared for 14-18 year olds.  Sex is already too prevalent in what they watch on regular TV and I think that's too young for a sex-based horror movie.  I'm no prude, but I'm so wary of movies that assume this age range is having random, meaningless sex and that's okay.  I think the age of the characters was about 19.

The scariest part was in the beginning when the girl has sex with some guy, gets drugged and wakes up strapped to a seat.  That should have been a huge lesson for teens in what can happen if you go to some remote place in a car with someone you don't know.  But that message was somehow lost during the rest of the movie.  Most Lifetime movies emphasize the mistake young girls (and guys) make, but this one skipped over that to make it into a horror movie- where friends don't question your morals and will stand by you and apparently can skip school and families don't care where they are or what they're doing.  Yeah, it's a movie, but once it got past the first 30 minutes, I found it to be ridiculous.  I especially hated when the main character had sex in the hospital to 'pass on' the curse because he wanted to help.  And again when another character agreed to 'help' at the end.  Sex was a burden, but the main character had slept with three people within a few months and it was portrayed as meaningless.

Also, the ending left it open to a sequel.  In the age of useless, pointless, redundant. and uninhibited sequels, this story-line really wasn't worth continuing.

7085017,4,B00VAVNN5W,"A good looking but otherwise average college girl is living a regular life. She hangs out with her friends, likes to swim, and has a new boyfriend. Things with the boyfriend are progressing typically, which means they have sex fairly soon. Right after they do it in the backseat of his car, he chloroforms her. When she wakes up tied to a wheel chair, he explains what's going on. He had sex with a girl before and she passed on this thing that has been stalking him. It takes human form and walks slowly toward its target. If it touches its target, that's the end for the target. The only way to pass the curse on to someone else is to have sex with them. To prove he isn't lying, they wait until the thing shows up. Anyone who is cursed can see it, but not anyone else. Then he takes her home and dumps her in the street.

Her friends come out and take care of her. The cops are called in but they can't find anything on the boyfriend. She leaves out the bit about the curse from the police report but does tell her friends. They try to help her deal with the situation. Things start falling apart when an old woman shows up on campus walking straight towards her without saying a thing. No one else sees the old woman, so that's really bad news. She roams from place to place and situation to situation trying to figure out how not to get killed.

The movie is an original horror flick. The premise is a nice twist on the ""having sex will get you killed"" trope in horror films. The only way to get rid of the killer is to have sex again, though even that isn't a guarantee, since if the killer gets someone, it reverts back to stalking the previous person. It's clearly a metaphor for the problems of promiscuity and sexually-transmitted diseases, but that takes a back seat to the continual terror of this inhuman force in human form that constantly appears and pursues the girl. Most every person is suspect and the only thing one can do is outrun it.

The movie's style enhances the relentless terror of the character. The score is reminiscent (in the best possible way) of John Carpenter and Vangelis. It's always noticeable and occasionally heavy-handed but is highly effective nonetheless. The music pairs well with the visual style. A lot of shots linger and pan around, as if the camera is trying to look everywhere. In many scenes, viewers get a glimpse of the ""it"" following her when she doesn't see it at first. The temptation is to shout at the screen, ""Look behind you!"" or ""over to the side!"" The atmosphere of the film is close to perfection.

Some bits of the story don't work as well. The characters don't seem very creative in trying to outrun or defeat the menace and occasional bits of CG look very CG, though they are rare. Unfortunately they come at the end of the film and stick out after an hour's worth of effective practical effects. Even so, these are relatively minor flaws in a fascinating and terrifying horror film.",1447977600,,2949,4.44547134935305

7085026,1,B00VAVNN5W,"Quick story recap: A ghost becomes attached to someone after having sex and tries to kill them afterwards unless they have sex with someone else in which case it will go after that person.

Where to begin?  IT WAS ALL TERRIBLE.  Thoroughly unimpressive acting from everyone.  There was no chemistry between actors, especially apparent in the first date and the subsequent sleeping with him afterwards.  I don't believe any woman who was even a little creeped out a first date would sleep with a dude like a day or two later and in his car.  Especially in the beginning almost everything the actors said felt like they were just regurgitating their memorized lines.  The first 20 minutes of the movie they didn't even try and put energy behind their words, very bland, very boring, the whole pool scene in the beginning and up to coming in the house...my vote for worst scene work by actors and director choices for shots I've seen all year.

The plot was terrible and filled with plot holes.  POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD?  The characters shot the ghost and it didn't work in middle of the movie but didn't learn and tried it again later on...just stupid.  The ghost just walks on foot so it takes forever for anything to happen.  The ghost kills everyone else within seconds of close contact but only pulls the hair of the main character on the beach in the middle.  it's human form can change in a split second to a different random person.  Why on earth did they show the ghost as a bare chested woman appearing to be peeing herself????? WHAT THE HELL?  It also makes no sense the demon needs to knock on your door or break a window to get you. Early in the movie the demon appearing as a random old woman in a nightgown, gets in the school.  It didn't break a window or it would have spooked the classroom which would have been scarier if it did.  However, in the middle, it needed to knock on the bedroom door to get the boy across the street. So at the end,  how did the Demon get into the old abandoned high school since it can't walk through doors? Also, how did the old abandoned high school have that pool filled with water and electricity if it was abandoned?  I also found it hard to believe the main character would have slept with or started a relationship with the dorky ""friend zoned"" guy.  The movie tried so hard to try to create sexual tension between them with dialogue ""Remember when we kissed like a million years ago, oh boy""  when there wasn't much on screen tension.

The movie couldn't figure out what decade this story was being told in.  It had lots of retro stuff  (old TVs, Everyone is always watching 1940 space films)  but also modern stuff (cell phones, the clothes, and homes).  it was distracting from the film.  Also,  there were too many moments near the end where NOTHING was going on...no music, just camera shots.

The only reason this movie gets 1 star, is the camera people did a decent job of framing shots and special f/x were decent as well.",1447804800,8,2981,4.488847583643123

7085104,5,B00VAVNN5W,"You may naturally read reviews before seeing this. Some will say they liked it, or not, some will spoil certain things. I urge you to stop reading them and go in blind to this. The only things you should know, without giving too much away, is that this is a *slow* build-up of a movie. It will require your patience, your uninterrupted time, and your imagination. If you want to be scared, you will be.

 SPOILER-FREE REVIEW 
The film starts off with a very calculated long opening shot. We follow a young woman as she's running from... something. That something is what makes this movie so scary. Whatever IT is, you don't want it catching up to you.

After IT is explained, we feel for the main character's dilemma. This person runs, they drive, they get the hell out of there, but we see and realize, it doesn't matter, IT *will* catch up to you, and we become just as exhausted as they are from trying to get away. This film is tense throughout the entire running time. Scenes of people relaxing end up being really tense. Sitting on a swing is really tense. Being locked in your room is really tense. The whole premise that it will follow you wherever you go doesn't allow you to relax because you can only guess when it will eventually get to you. The film eventually becomes uncomfortable to watch because you feel so uneasywhich is what any good horror film should do. A lot of the scariness also comes from the unexplained; we fill in a lot of it with our own imaginations.

The concept of the movie is so grand, that you wonder how it will all end. I can't think of any way it could've ended better than it did.

I read a lot of reviews on IMDb after I saw this. There were a lot of people that hated it. I can only imagine they didn't give it a chance and needed everything explained and handed to them. They most likely make fun of movies that aren't over-the-top gross, or bloody scary. I think they've become jaded that maybe they've forgotten it's the little things that scare us the most: walking home alone on a street at night, a sound coming from downstairs, the sort of primal fear that only our minds can deliver.

If you appreciate film and love to be scared, watch this unique movie. It's not about blood and guts, it's something deeper, something that could chill you to the boneif you let it. It's a film that may follow you after the credits end. Recommended.",1446508800,,2385,4.406818181818182
7085105,4,B00VAVNN5W,"Overall a good film.

7085146,3,B00VAVNN5W,"""It Follows"" is a bizarre little film. If you watch it expecting something that is going to shock your socks off, you're going to be very disappointed. In fact, I found that watching a second time at home (after I'd seen it in the theater and was rather unimpressed) the film was more intense and frightening. And here's why:

It is surreal. While I was watching it I got the same sense of something being ""off""  that I did when I first saw ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (though that film was superior and pushed the limits of the slasher film genre). It also has some scenes that harken to ""Phantasm"" in the way they are shot and set up. Both of those films had very definite surreal qualities as does ""It Follows.""

For instance, the greatest sense of discomfort I had was not knowing when the film was taking place. We are not supposed to - we know it was released as a contemporary film in 2014. The filmmakers obviously want this to have a disconcerting feeling to it throughout and they achieve it by intentionally muddling the time period through clothing styles, interior design choices, technology, automobiles and television programs and films. The neighborhoods are all post WWII - working class Detroit, so it could be taking place anytime since then, but then furniture is a combination of late 60's and early 80's - nothing newer that I saw. Televisions are all the old CRT type and the programs being played and watched predate cable television. That said, in the first scenes a 2014 model car is shown and a character uses a cell phone and later a character uses an e-reader shaped like a clamshell BUT other than that there are no cell phones, no computers or Internet (no searching for WHAT it is that is following them). This lack of modern technology isolates the characters. It disconcerted me and I think it will others. There's other little things that confuse us as well: tattoos on the lead's finger and hands scream TODAY, but the clothing on everyone shouts early 1980's. Even the locales are dated - there's not a modern looking structure in sight.

In fact, It Follows harkens to the pre-1980's type of slasher films (sex is bad and you will die if you have sex), but it is not graphically gory except for one brief shot. I don't think this film will win awards, but I do think that it should be a film that is discussed in Film Appreciation classes because there is a lot going on here that teenagers may not realize simply because they don't have the older films from the 1970's as a point of reference.

I know I've focused on the tone and setting of the film primarily, but that's because these factors are essentially a character unto themselves. The actors are good believable individuals. They're not showy or spectacularly good-looking - they are ordinary. Ordinary in a way that is good.

This is good filmmaking. This is believable acting. Is it a good film? Are these actors who will have fruitful careers? I don't know. But I like that the filmmakers gave me something to get worked up about and something to set me on edge.

Good job.",1446336000,,3074,4.578181818181818

Finally, they never explained what ""It"" was, which is good because its unknown nature is part of what makes it scary.

Cons: Some cheesy teen movie moments, but not too bad.
Too many oddly unexplained things distracted me, like why all the kids in this town have big square cars from the 70s, but one girl clearly has a modern smartphone-like device in the shape of a pink clam shell, KIND of threw me off.

The main character, Jay (played Maika Monroe) is a sweet College student who has a romantic tryst with her new boyfriend. That tryst comes with major consequences in ways you don't see coming. I won't give too much away but some strange entity begins following Jay around her college campus and neighborhood. With the help of her friends and sister, Jay must do everything in her power to stop the entity from ending her life. I enjoyed this movie, the pacing is a bit slow and the ending left a lot to be desired but overall, I thought ""It Follows"" is a solid horror flick. I also enjoyed Maika Monroe's quiet but intriguing performance. She has a subtle charm about her. I hope to see her in more films in the future. Another thing that makes ""It Follows"" so special and memorable is the musical score by Disasterpeace. I think he did a brilliant job. The score has a nostalgic kind of vibe, (think ""Psycho"" or ""Halloween"") but still feels modern and fresh. I love it. I highly recommend ""It Follows"". Enjoy!",1445990400,,1316,4.464730290456432

The story, the interacting of the characters, and the acting were all balanced and it never tried to do more than it set out to do, which is to entertain us with a unique premise.

Without giving too much away, the film is basically a slasher with an innovative premise and unique plot.  A force or curse of some sort follows around a young woman after she has an innocent sexual encounter with a date.  The tension that ensues from that point onward is well done and finely executed, making this movie one of the better pieces of Horror in a long while.

7085246,5,B00VAVNN5W,"[Spoilers ahead, but I think they are good spoilers to know going into the film. Won't break the plot.]

What I love about It Follows is that it isn't really a horror movie like we typically think of horror. The two dominant themes are dread and nightmares (the latter being stated by the director). This thing is always coming, slowly, but eternally. Like a nightmare, it cannot be explained or understood. It just is.

The movie has many scenes that are slow, where nothing really happens. That's why it really isn't a good party movie. To truly appreciate it, watch it alone in the dark. If you're with others watching it, make sure someone isn't sitting there munching on chips or playing with their cell phone. This movie requires immersion.

A lot of people dismiss the movie as being about STDs. That is far too simplistic of an explanation. Ultimately, it is about existentialism and being unable to control your fate. That's why Yara reads those quotes from Dostoyevsky's ""The Idiot"" and Jay's professor is reading T.S. Eliot's poem ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"" when she first notices it.

For some reason, this film is really controversial. People who don't like it hate it and want everyone to know. Maybe because it has gotten so much build-up? If you are looking for a horror film that jumps at you and you can forget about it after you're done and laugh about being scared by a movie, don't even waste your time. This is a film about the dread of life that never stops following you.",1445385600,,1506,4.629213483146067
7085247,4,B00VAVNN5W,"A pretty solid horror movie.  The idea is one that, I believe, every human being has had nightmares about.  A relentless SOMETHING is chasing you and you can never run fast enough to get away.  So the premise is rock solid.  The execution of this premise could use a little work, but the fact that they used this premise - one I'm surprised no one else has used (to my knowledge) - makes it very much worth seeing.
SPOILERS (THO0UGH AS VAGUE AS I CAN BE):  I will try to give away as little as possible.  Making it, essentially, a kind of STD was a little out there.  Also, it's showing the use of reason took away from it - as did it's use of thrown objects.  It should have been left with no reason and never used an object at all.  The deaths it inflicted should have been more like the opening scene where we see our protagonists body.  In other words, a quick glimpse of savage violence.  Also, the boy who passed this deadly STD seemed to have a LOT of knowledge about it.  Where did he get it?  How did he know it would work it's way back down the line of the 'infected?'

It looks like it could be in the eighties since so many of the objects in the movie look like run down items left over from the seventies. Shag carpets. Tube TV sets. Gaudy table lamps. One girl in the story is using an e-reader, which would point to the present day. The director doesn't use the lazy technique of creating an eerie mood by setting all the action at night. Much of the action takes place in broad daylight, and it's still creepy. The whole premise is highly original. Spoiler alert, it's now another movie in which supernatural forces enter into our world and the protagonist must stop it before our world is plunge into eternal darkness for the umpteenth time.

As many have noted, you'll probably be most frightened by scenes of supernatural beings walking slowly towards the actors while they talk and act in normal, everyday fashion.

Having said that, I feel like the movie is shallow at the core, more an exercise in visual style than an expression of views or character. Its theme is adolescent sexual anxiety, though the director wants you to believe that he has something to say about the misery and tedium of modern suburban life. The extended recitation of Eliot's ""Prufrock"" is hammy and over-handed, but the sort of thing that precocious high-school students might mistake for depth and meaning. Wes Craven visited the same themes in his original Nightmare On Elm Street, but without the flamboyant Robert Englund as Freddy to keep things moving, the movie stalls and slows on a regular basis.

I will say that this movie is one of similar recent horror flicks that focus more on visual style than on torture porn and shaky hand-held video cams for its effects. That much I like and I hope it is a continuing trend. Otherwise, It Follows is good but not great.",1445126400,,1246,4.790697674418604

7085254,4,B00VAVNN5W,"The cast give great performances bringing these ""half-dead, unmotivated, wasted young"" formations of teenage 'angsters' to life. The cinematography is more indie than the usual MTV produced films that have come out before ""It Follows"", and the total lack of product placement that screams 21st century cinema is refreshing. The story is very dark, with some real emotion that seeps in just enough for fans to connect with the horror that is teen logic and lack of parental supervision. Then add the actual nightmare of consequence in the form of a demon, (which is obviously a show of blatant disregard for sexual responsibility, and the spread of STD's), is really entertaining and thrilling to watch play out.

The special effects hang on a mix of chilling suspense as we see the characters reaction to some f'ed up personas that the demon uses while stalking the victims, strong bass driven sound effects that instantly put you on guard anticipating the approaching horror. The special effects stay mixed between really cool practical effects and the necessary CGI stuff. The soundtrack is as off beat, and indie as the filming style choice, and the set designs. Honestly it is all just really impressive, and even though it is Hollywood level production, everything looks and feels so indie.

Overall ""It Follows"" is a great return to classic horror film movie making, and filled with plenty of terrifying moments to delight most horror fans. The gore is limited, and the kills are on the mild side, but most of the film is just so intense, dark, and filled with chilling atmosphere that the build up to the actual kill/death scene gives good scare. My only disappointment was the f'ed up ending. If you can call it that. Yeah I know it is a creative way to say that the story is not over, because sex and youth making bad choices is eternal, much like the evil and darkness that accompanies all our choices in this complicated life. Still it ticked me off a bit, they could have took a few steps more with that final scene instead of the one they went with, maybe a small reactionary moment with the characters. Anyway ""It Follows"" is a great modern horror film that deserves props for originality and a definitive return to classic nightmare story telling. - See more at: http://asouthernlifeinscandaloustimes.blogspot.com/2015/10/my-review-of-it-follows.html#sthash.rytDfX5A.dpuf",1444953600,,2386,5.053299492385787

Informed attributes?

Contradictions? There are so many that's it's hard to pick just one!

7085266,5,B00VAVNN5W,"Here is a true horror film lover's film (as in film, not just a movie), very reminiscent of the crafting in Halloween in its time: excellent choices of camera work, attention to setting and detail (a nod to the juxtaposition of the banality of ordinary suburbia with the later part in the decrepit city), and a compelling image(s) to bring to life a simple yet effective story and ratchet up the tension at the same time. (That's the greatest compliment coming from me, as Halloween is my favorite film, if I were forced to pick only one). The story hinges around a small group of teenagers that are being stalked (well, really only one is- the rest are trying to help) by an entity in different guises, all equally grotesque. The music, though nothing iconic like Carpenter's theme, enhanced the mood. I have not seen a solid horror film that engaged me throughout in a long, long time, a mature, effective one that is faithful to its story (thematically original and entirely within the domain of horror- which is not the same as gore). A film that relies entirely on competent camera work and acting to drive the tension home. And yes, there is plenty of tension, though I'd say it was sustained well but it did not climax. While the ending was quite interesting; it seemed like a pause more than an ending. (That's not a complaint). his film harkens back to the good old days! Nothing pulled me out of the story, nothing I had to excuse just to get a cheap thrill, like a story we've heard a thousand times, told through irritating dialogue, contrived performances, usually idiotic, unrelatable teenagers, and overreliance on cheap jump scares. Because of that, I rounded up to 5. In the old days, I likely would've rated it a 4.5, simply because I wanted more to chew on: e.g. about the curse, like how did that guy know he could pass it on. Still, that may have weakened it, so the jury is out. Its just something that gnawed at me. Some things are best left unsaid, without watering down the experience with thought. Keep it visceral. Perhaps this is one of those. Much like the why and how of Myers did not matter. Horror is ultimately about the depths of the unconscious, firmly planted in irrational territory. Anyhow, I am amazed. I'd given up hope for something like this to emerge in the sea of detritus that has become horror. Thank you.",1444608000,,2351,4.5866983372921615

When I was done watching it, it left me wanting my money back. I will not watch this again and will never encourage anyone to watch it.
The best thing I can say about this film is it was unsettling at times. This film pleads for more depth, plot and character development. It has jump shots and just plain awful music! The character's actions just don't make sense. I see some people saying this is a great movie because it's deep and morally complex, which is true, however a horror/thriller is not the place for these things.",1444608000,,680,4.404761904761905
7085268,5,B00VAVNN5W,"Suspenseful and eerie. This is a movie that is scary in tone and atmosphere more than pure gore. It's unsettling. The music and camera style really reminded me of John Carpenter's work. Even the title ""It Follows"" seems like a bit of a throwback.

If your idea of horror is House of 1,000 Corpses then this movie may not be for you. If you were scared by Halloween (original) or Blair Witch Project, then this movie is probably for you. While I felt suspense throughout most of the movie, and a few parts made me jump, in general it's one of those movies where you sympathize with the main character's plight - something many horror movies fail to do. It disturbs you more than it scares you. It also leaves a lasting impression - I can remember details of the film, elements I found particularly unsettling, a year later.

Like every other horror movie I've seen there were a few times I was yelling ""Why would you do that?!"" at the TV, but generally the plot was pretty solid.

Those that like to analyze the meaning of movies - of any genre - will probably also enjoy It Follows.",1444608000,,1082,4.42713567839196
7085269,5,B00VAVNN5W,"I bought this Blue-ray sight unseen based solely on a ridiculously high aggregate review score on Rottentomatoes.com - and I was not disappointed.  I have read many negative reviews from regular viewers, though, that cite the film as uninventive, exceedingly slow, and even boring - and the only conclusion that I can come to is that they watched the film from the most shallow perspective ever.  On the surface, just reading the back of the case will give you the entire plot driver for the film, and if that was all there was to it, I, too, would've been bored out of my skull.  Where this movie excels, however, is in it's handling of the developing morality and the visceral agony of your first, real, life altering choices as a teenager.  The atmosphere is hyperrealistic lower middle class east coast suburbs - and no detail is left out.  From the shabby couches to the scuffed sneakers, we entirely buy the notion of average teens, feeling trapped and a bit edgy at the end of their high school years, just at the edge of perceived freedom.  The details themselves are rarely without symbolism, from the absurd red heels worn in the first scene (a classical literary symbol for futility) to the moody lighting changes mirroring the protagonist's increasing feelings of hopelessness and isolation.  The film quickly becomes a delicious philosophical quagmire questioning our values of self, friends, and human life in general - what would you do to save your own life?

I can understand why some reviewers decry the film for demonizing teen sexuality or as a modern boogeyman tale for the evils of STDs - I easily saw that interpretation.  For me, however, the tone of the film strongly indicated that the director was far more interested in pushing us past that easy message and onto the more meaty complications of life and death choices.  The layering of detail is so striking that you begin to question the timeline of events and the motivations of even secondary characters - encouraging multiple viewings and discussions over coffee.

Watch the film and then ask yourself, is the opening scene a prequel to the following events... or is it a horrible conclusion to what follows?",1444608000,,2190,4.8445040214477215

7085293,5,B00VAVNN5W,Not perfect and not a masterpiece of cinema but I'm giving it a full 5 stars because it's breaking away from the awful formula of typical Hollywood horror films. Granted it's still a genre film and it's an exploitation film as well but it made a dedicated execution to give a fresh angle to the all to common cop-out with regards to about 90% of most horror films. And it isn't a fast-paced film - it's a slow burner yet compelling enough to lure the audience viewer in tempered steps frame-by-frame through it's subtly vacant world. Soundtrack/score was rather impressive too! A little odd at times but it works and it was probably due more to the fact that I'm so conditioned by the omnipresence our culture's mainstream film scores.

The movie creators establishes an unsettling sense of dread by presenting a slightly off version of reality that subtly suggests an a story set in an alternate universe.  The clothing and technology of the last four decades are mishmashed into one reality, the technology that teens use is modern but ""wrong"" (the smart phone/kindle shaped like a pressed powder compact) and so on.  This is very effective in creating a slightly alien world where these type of things - remorseless otherworldly beings hunt down and kill sexually active men and women - can and do happen. The low budget works in favor of the filmmaking by pressuring the director to make a tight, spare movie with a minimum of special effects. It reminds me of some of the earlier movies of David Cronenberg.",1444176000,,883,4.720779220779221
7085317,3,B00VAVNN5W,"I am not a fan of slasher movies and haven't watched the Exorcist either; I am in favor of light horror, for example The Conjuring. It follows doesnt fall in either of these sub-genres because, though it lacks blood and gore, it emits creepiness until the last shot.

The movie starts with a young woman running away from her home terrified, as if someone, or something, is chasing her. The direction and music create an ominous atmosphere of impending doom and I was eager to see what follows (excuse the pun). The first act is original and exciting, as the main character, Jay, meets an attractive young man, not suspecting that having sex with him will bring her in the same desperate situation as the aforementioned girl.

Someone in imdb wrote that It follows is like Babaduk and I agree, to some extent: they both rely on an atmosphere of claustrophobia instead of plot development and solving mysteries (1), they have an undefined evil which targets inexplicably a heroine who gradually loses her mind and their ending is unclear (2).  Thankfully, It follows is much more interesting. The idea of an evil that comes closer with every passing minute until it grabs you in its clutches, the realistic performance of Maika Monroe and the unusual music with its occasional crescendos grabbed my attention.

The presentation is the movies best aspect, especially the way the camera moves slowly to reveal another portion of the scenery, the use of yellow lights in the night and the absence of sun. It makes you think the demon may be anywhere, behind the fence while Jay is relaxing in her pool or in the hall outside her room. The only thing I didn't like was some unnecessary nudity intending to provide cheap shock.

The movie has a characteristic that is common in the horror genre, connecting sex with murder, maybe because it is intriguing to connect two opposites or simply because of influences from puritanism. However, it can also be interpreted as an allegory about the agony people feel when they keep changing sexual partners without forming a deep relationship, failing to know who the other person truly is, thus they end up being chased by loneliness for all their lives (3).

It Follows will disappoint you if you expect a big mystery, bloody violence or classic horror. It is relatively slow and its villain is weak compared to the supernatural threats of other movies. Nevertheless, it made me be afraid the main character could have a terrible fate until the credits started rolling and thats what I want from a thriller.

Spoiler alert!

(1) First, the story gets repetitive after some time: Jay sees the demon is near, she runs away scared, stops to get some rest, then the same happens again. Second, all the effort to locate Hugh leads nowhere. Third, its illogical that the kids never asked the help of their families, although maybe its meant to cause more tension and underline the fact that modern teenagers don't communicate well with their parents.

(2) Did the demon die in the pool? In the last scene, do Jay and Paul believe they are safe? Is the person who follows them a normal human?

(3) Hugh was chased by the demon after having sex with a woman he met in a bar. Jay had sex with him without knowing him either. Paul, who thought he was in love with Jay, doesnt come closer to her after they sleep together and his mood doesnt become better.",1444176000,,3382,4.707275803722505
7085318,5,B00VAVNN5W,"Simply put - this is a great step forward for horror cinema.  For those of you who enjoy a sense of dread and tension in your horror movies (as opposed to gore or jumpscares - both legitimate devices but often ill-used these days), ""It Follows"" will be right up your alley.

Without getting too deep into things - imagine watching a classic 80's slasher movie (Friday the 13th or Halloween, perhaps).  Take the classic tropes of ""horny teenagers,"" ""having sex will kill you,"" and ""the silent, immortal killer.""  Now strip the whole thing down to its barest elements, remove the gore and jumpscares, and place it in Detroit.

What are you left with, then?  A silent, inexorable *thing* that hunts you remorselessly because you had sex.  It stalks you...slowly, without remorse, without words, and definitely with malice.  This is the scenario the protagonist deals with, and it's amazing how high the dread can climb.

The cast all does an excellent job, and the director and cinematographer both do excellent jobs, particularly the latter.  Combining long takes for many of the ""action"" scenes with a photographer's sense of composition, there is a Kubrickian feel to the film.  Add an excellent synthesizer score and an ambiguous setting, and the movie instantly has a slightly dreamy, timeless feel.

If you liked Stoker, The Shining (Kubrick's version), SInister, or any horror movie that depends on atmosphere and tension more than gore and loud noises, then you'll love It Follows.",1444003200,,1486,5.020408163265306

7085343,4,B00VAVNN5W,"This was an enjoyable and unique film. If I was to categorize it, I would say it is more surreal than slasher, even though the people in this film are being pursued by ""someone."" I don't need to go into too much detail as the movie description sums everything up nicely.

The style of the film is what stood out. The director effectively used methods to keep the viewer off balance to add to the unsettling feel. For instance, there is no sense of time to connect with. Was this occurring in the 70's? The 90's? Also aside from the main protagonists, all other people in the film just sort of lived off to the side in the periphery. This gave the film an almost dream-like feel.

The movie does stumble a little later on, relying on a couple old horror movie cliches, which honestly kind of pulled me out of the moment. But it did recover its footing shortly afterwards and kept me interested to the end.

I think this little film really stands out among all the standard big studio jump-scare releases that try and wear the ""horror"" label. It's is a fun and unsettling indie-budget horror film that is certainly a must watch for any horror aficionado.",1443312000,,1152,4.476190476190476

7085351,1,B00VAVNN5W,"It's almost like Terrence Malick directed a horror movie: not much happens and it's not emotionally involving at all, but the photography is nice. Some parts of the photography and the incidental music remind me of John Carpenter's Halloween, and the scriptwriter likes making one of the characters spout meaningless passages from Dostoyevsky's The Idiot. I suspect they are an attempt to make the movie artsy, but they fall flat because they're just tacked on - nothing in the film has any bearing on the Dostoyevsky quotes, other than just a vague commentary on life and death. As with many teen horror films, the movie equates losing one's virginity with impending death, but it's so heavy-handed that it seems ridiculous.

The movie is filmed in Detroit and makes reference to 8 Mile, but there's no subtext there - it just receives a throwaway line in the middle of the film for no reason. We see a couple of scenes with neighborhoods filled with empty houses and boarded up windows - no reason, they're just to show the movie takes place in Detroit. There's no allegory of the car industry or of poverty or societal breakdown - nothing to elevate the film in terms of social commentary.

And although young men and women seem to be dying by being torn apart by some sort of nutcase or animal, the police seem noticeable mostly by their absence. No one gets interviewed - all we see is a parked police car in one scene. No crime tape - nothing. And there's a scene where the main character crashes her car a few hundred yards from the thing, but apparently, it loses interest, because someone finds her in a cornfield, then she's taken to the hospital and bandaged up, then she wakes up seemingly hours later and the creature is off doing something else - which I wish I had been at that point, because this was becoming as ridiculous as it was tedious. This has to be the least scary creature ever - it's like being hunted by a single slow-moving zombie. Apparently no one told the scriptwriter that slow-moving zombies are only a threat if there are lots of them.

And this is the most annoying thing in the movie: the thing that's following the main character moves at about 2mph, and it can't get through locked doors, so it's not much of a threat. If the main character simply went to live overseas, she'd be safe for 6 months, then she could move back to the US. Heck, if her family was wealthy, she could just spend 6 months in New Zealand and 6 months in New York and she'd be perfectly safe. Alternatively, she could sleep in a basement with a heavy wooden door and she'd be fine, then she could find a school 16 miles away from her home, then commute every day and she'd be fine for her school day - the creature would reach her school right when it was time to go home. I mean, I just don't see how this is even a threat for anyone with half a brain.",1443139200,16,2866,4.455238095238095

The movie has some plot hiccups (why did the nude, old man ""It"" climb a roof and just stand there when it literally follows the whole movie?), but covered its tracks enough to be forgivable.

7085370,4,B00VAVNN5W,"Hey, what's going on here?  Teenagers in modern dress, with very modern problems like alienation from nearly everything and the potentially damaging allure of sex, but surrounded by homes, cars, and objects d'art from the 1970's.  Halfway through the movie, I settled on a theory.  I'm thinking that the '70's setting simply keeps the viewer as ""off-balance"" as the characters are, as they struggle to avoid the lethal, zombie-like stalking of old sexual partners.  Or, maybe it's the idea that the characters feel as trapped and hopeless as you would, if you were stuck in the dreadfully flat decor they inhabit.

The concept of bad karma is intriguing,and keeps the terror the audience experiences genuinely thrilling, while we dread the next encounter.  The last ditch effort at the swimming pool to thwart the reappearing zombies is surreal (I know that's overused, but there's just no other word).  The sequence makes you think of the swimming pool scene in ""Cat People,"" only with blenders and toasters added.

7085382,3,B00VAVNN5W,"I had read this was the best horror movie of this year. If one judged by the opening scene, it might be, but the rest of the film... There are shocking moments, but they are too widely spaced.  This movie is 1 hour and 40 minutes long. Shortening it to an hour and compacting the horror would've made it much better.

The first premise of three teenaged sisters, living alone in a neighborhood where there are other teens living with their families, just didn't work. Why are three high school girls allowed to do that? They attend school forapproximately one day, then chuck classes to fight the horror. The mother shows up in one brief scene, asleep in her daughter's hospital room and that's it as far as parental appearances.  One of the girls is dating a boy with whom she finally has sex. Immediately afterward, he chloroforms her, takes her to an abandoned parking garage, strips her and ties her to a wheel chair, telling her that he's passed ""it"" on to her and the only way she can get rid of ""it"" is to pass it to someone else but if she doesn't and ""it"" kills her, he and all the others will be killed, too. Then a naked woman appears walking inexorably toward them and he whisks the girl away, dumps her in front of her house and disappears. The police do nothing. They find the house where the boy supposedly lived, and there's evidence he was squatting there, but don't try to find him. They simply disappear out of the story so the teenagers have to take care of business themselves.  When the boy is found, he's with his parents, and why didn't they wonder where he was all those days he was living in someone else's house?  Some of this just doesn't compute, especially the girl's insistence that the police not be told anything else and her parents not be notified. It all seems contrived scriptwriter's ploy to have the kids tackle the problem alone. In fact, a lot of things these kids do doesn't make sense.

There are long tracking shots of houses as their car drives past, panning shots of beaches, the ocean, more houses, long corridors, a completely useless panorama  of a school hallway. Lots of scene with no dialogue. There are zoom-ins on faces during conversations, with long pauses between questions and answers. In other words, everything is slow and spread out. It's like padding in that essay you have to write but don't have enough material.

Granted, there's plenty of shock...when it happens. The creatures are all scary and mostly naked or in their underwear. Since no one but the girl can see them, it's even more frightening, especially when she's attacked with other people around.  Those two scenes were tremendously frightening. Another scene, with a friend who voluntarily accepts ""it"" and is later killed by what appears to be his mother is never explained. Of course, it's never explained where the creatures come from in the first place. Are they ghosts of others who've been killed by ""it""? Re-animated by ""it""? Or what?

I could go into a socialized, psychological diatribe about promiscuous teenage sex and make this an allegory for current sexual mores and morality but that isn't the point. The sex isn't like that, it's to escape the danger. which doesn't really seem to work, and the people involved are voluntarily doing it to attempt to conquer the creatures, so there's a method in their immorality if you want to term it that.

All in all, this film could've done with some judicious editing, and shortening. Then it might've been the ""best horror movie of the year"" as touted. As it is, it's a disappointment with moments of shock. The ending is also let down as well as an enlightenment...the horror is neither conquered but only held at bay, following inexorably...and the story simply quits. My reaction was: That's it? Or will there be an It Follows 2?

We'll see.

By the end of the movie, I was actively rooting for the monster to just kill the stupid teenagers already.  Huge chunks of this movie actually feel like the director was showing off his film school appreciation rather than telling the damn story.  There are also some major mistakes that were laughable.  For instance, at the end, there's a scene where the girl speaks of the monster as being ""too horrible"" to describe (or something similar to that).  That would have normally been really cool, because the monster was already established as having the ability to take on different forms, and some of them were really spooky.  But then when you finally see it for yourself, it was just in the form of some dude in his underpants.  WTF, guys?  Did you forget that this was supposed to be a psychotic demon-thingy?

7085422,5,B00VAVNN5W,"Time and time again I learn (especially with low-budget horror movies) to completely distrust Amazon ratings. This movie is no exception.

""It Follows"" is the kind of horror movie Spielberg might make if he ever decided to make a horror movie. And I'm not talking about modern Spielberg (bombastic mega-nonsense like ""Super 8"" [I mean seriously, Spielberg has lost it lately; and yes, I realize Abrams directed S8 but the point stands--just look at War of the Worlds), no--I'm talking about the gritty, hungry Spielberg who made ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Duel/dp/B00RNV4MDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Duel</a>"" with Dennis Weaver and the scary truck. Or maybe this movie reminds me of J.J. Abrams back when he was directing movies like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joy-Ride/dp/B001F63D4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joy Ride</a>."" Basically, if M. Night Shyamalan, Steven Spielberg, and John Carpenter ever got together (when they were all way younger, hungrier directors) and made a movie based on one of R.L. Stine's Fear Street books, they would have made ""It Follows.""

I just love movies where kids get to be in charge. Parents are essentially nowhere to be found so it's up to the teenagers to figure out how to get out of the mess. This conceit is what make movies like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disturbia/dp/B000W9DVHS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disturbia</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unfriended/dp/B013QOHWOS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unfriended</a>"" so much fun to watch. We were all kids once and we can all relate to how a bunch of teenagers might react if they had some monster chasing them. It's a lot of fun. Remember ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/E-T-The-Extra-Terrestrial/dp/B00BP4ZNFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">E.T.,The Extra-Terrestrial</a>?"" Same idea. Fun because we get to be the kids again.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-Follows-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B00TYGJ3NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It Follows (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)</a>&nbsp;is really the showpiece and big surprise in this movie. It's pure old-school John Carpenter and stands out among perhaps any soundtrack I've heard in the last ten years. The composer, Disasterpiece, is a ""chiptune"" artist and he seems to have recorded the entire soundtrack in a few weeks after school or work using sound chips from 8-bit video games from the late '80's and '90's. That gives the whole move a heavy ""synth-bass"" sound that reminds you of ""Halloween"" and the original (NOT the remake) ""Assault on Precinct 13."" For a first time film composer (he'd only been doing video games up to this point) Disasterpiece created a simply outstanding and original piece of work. I watched the movie again JUST to listen to the soundtrack and then got into the whole chiptune music genre which is actually quite excellent music if you grew up playing the NES and SNES or Final Fantasy VII; basically if you're between 27 and 32 years old.

The directing and cinematography blew me away for a microbudget film. It's like the director graduated from film school, absorbed all the idiosyncrasies of M. Night (lots of long shots; lots of visual symmetry; a very consistent gloomy suburban look and feel), and then found a cinematographer who could match his wits. The result is visually beautiful and desolate and freaking scary.

Maika Monroe (the main actress who plays Jay) is one of those women who is not exactly drop-dead bombshell gorgeous; but she is very compelling to watch on screen and quite captivating and pretty in a torn-down-but-strong-willed way. She kinda reminds me of Brittany Murphey like that; and she even looks like Brittany Murphey in that washed out dirty blonde girl-next-door way. I get the feeling she's a really new actress (I think she comes from sports or something) and she's humble about her lack of facility with the craft by completely underplaying the part and delivering the lines without too much embellishment. It works and I was very appreciative that she just delivered the d*** lines without trying to impress anyone. I saw her in another movie after this one called ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Guest/dp/B00R2KMGN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Guest</a>"" (also really good horror/thriller movie) and she did a great job in that movie too.

I wrote this review because this movie is getting trashed by other reviewers and I wonder whether we were watching the same film. Of course that's rhetorical: I know we were watching the same movie but I imagine they went into the movie expecting something they didn't find. Since I never heard of the movie until I watched it I had no preconceptions and enjoyed the film so much I bought it. If you aren't pretentious about your low-budget horror movies and want to watch a teen-scare Halloween and popcorn horror movie with high production values and an outstanding soundtrack, rent or buy this movie. If you like this movie, also take a look at ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Skies/dp/B00BEIYG98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Skies</a>"" with Keri Russell and the above-mentioned ""The Guest"" which also stars Maika Monroe.",1441929600,,5455,5.987179487179487

7085425,4,B00VAVNN5W,"It's a little upsetting to see this film getting '3 Stars' (for now). This movie has been praised all over by critics, and has a great Rotten Tomatoes score. But let me share my perspectives on the film.

I get a little defensive when a small movie like this breaks through the mainstream. I root for the underdog, and I feel like despite the limitations of the budget or whatever, a movie like this can capture the imagination of the public. That's not only powerful, but rare these days.

The problem is that sometimes a movie like this may not hit the right notes with the populous. It's kinda niche. In fact, if this movie came out in the 80's, the Amazon reviews would be 4 Stars and up (maybe). There's no doubt that the movie is a slow burn, but that create atmosphere and tension. I really think that is somewhat of a turn off for some. And it's funny how people are offended by the movie's 'message'. There is NO message. The filmmakers is not saying that thin-skinned people think this is like..anti-sex movie. Sure, whatever you say. I think the filmmakers wanted to make a movie with a certain allegory, but it's more like subtext than a moral tale.

Anyway, I'm rambling. I just will not allow this movie to get three stars, when Transofrmers 4 has a higher rating than this. It's a different genre, and it's off by a few thousand reviews, but still, it's the principle, baby!!!",1441843200,,1391,4.490118577075099

7085461,3,B00VAVNN5W,"There seems to be quite a few films recently which hearken back to the late 70's/early 80's in terms of filmmaking style. IT FOLLOWS is one of the films in this mold that capture a certain feeling of nostalgia while also having its foot firmly planted in the present. It's about a vague entity that follows you around after having sex with somebody who also has the same problem. Inasmuch as the Friday THE 13TH series was about abstinence, IT FOLLOWS is in a similar vein, with a heavy dose of John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN and Wes Craven for good measure. The most outstanding part of this film is the subtle approach taken with the horror, letting it build quietly without using the score to jolt you. There was also great care taken with the direction and cinematography that helped to build an atmosphere of tension and dread. Even without being a horror movie (albeit, more of a psychological one), the cinematography and camera-work was excellent, with precise, deliberate movement, slow pans and zooms, etc. It was quite artful, to say the least. I should also mention the outstanding score by Disasterpeace, which captures a feeling I haven't felt since watching HALLOWEEN. So, at least on the surface, IT FOLLOWS has a lot going for it. However, I do ask a little bit more from movies I watch than to impress me visually and aurally, and apart from these qualities, IT FOLLOWS was quite banal. The acting was decent, although no one really stood out from the rest. The potential in the setup for this ""it"" to be anything or anyone allowed for a few good sequences, but it also meant that the narratively was a little too linear for my tastes. It boils down to have sex, wait, and run. And for a 100 minute film, I expected more. There wasn't even an underlying emotional subtext like was in THE BABADOOK. Still, despite being bored through parts of it, the film does manage to pull together for a decent (and appropriate) finish. I would recommend people to see this, but don't go in expecting something revolutionary. There is a little bit of subtext about abstinence/STDs that can be read into IT FOLLOWS and, courtesy of a CHARADE billboard, possibly some meta-commentary on artificiality. However, IT FOLLOWS works perfectly fine as a stylistic exercise that aspires to little more than imitating its cinematic forebears, and does an admittedly good job at it.",1441411200,,2371,4.771289537712895

This movie hit a lot of psychologically terrifying notes for me. First there is that fear that you never really know someone as well as you think you do. This is even more true when in that exciting puppy love stage. The second fear that this film plays on is that Jay never really knows where the horror will turn up or what it will look like. Jay has her sister and her friends helping her out but in the end, they're just a bunch of kids trying to figure things out. That's scary. One day things are normal for these kids and the next they're thrown into a world they're not even aware existed.

I also found myself confused many times during the movie.  The plot, as simple as it is, made some sense.  The periodic subplots often made no sense whatsoever.

The only good I saw in this film was the fact that most of it was filmed in Detroit.  That city needs, and deserves, an infusion of cash to restore its base.  Perhaps some good came from the fact that many scenes were filmed in that city.

7085525,5,B00VAVNN5W,"One of the truly wonderful things about the horror genre is that it is one of the few genres that creators can play with ideas and metaphors and have them play out on a visceral level that keeps things somewhat grounded in the physical world without having to play solely in the metaphysical world. It can keep stories beholden to the action within the film and it can also be subject to a myriad of interpretations. This is very much the case with David Robert Mitchell's extraordinary IT FOLLOWS.

The film focuses on Jay (Maika Monroe), a high schooler who lives in a decent middle class suburb of Detroit and is seeing a young man she really likes. They have sex, and in a disturbing turn afterwards, he chloroforms her, ties her to a wheelchair and tells her an insane tale. He had sex with her only to pass on a malevolent entity that has been following him almost everywhere. He warns her of other dangers she will face; the entity is slow but smart and will take on physical forms of people she recognizes and maybe even loves and no one else will be able to see it unless she sleeps with someone else and passes it on. They fall under attack by the slow-moving entity and they escape. She tries to return to her normal existence but soon finds herself being pursued by the entity under different faces and bodies. She tries to explain her fears to her sister Kelly (Lily Sepe), her other friends Yara (Olivia Luccardi) and Paul (Keir Gilchrist), and her former flame Greg (Daniel Zovatto), but they try to explain it away as post-traumatic stress. But when they try to get away for the weekend at Greg's parents' beach house, they begin to believe the truth. Soon, the decision must come for Jay whether she might risk someone else's life in order to pass the curse on and if she does, will ""it"" still not come for her regardless?

Mitchell keeps the pressure on throughout the film offering a blend of a few scattered cool jump scares and a pervasive sense of dread. Some of the moments in the film that try to add a little more gravitas can end up seeming like a little much, as in moments where Yara is reading excerpts from Dostoyevsky's ""The Idiot"", or when an English teacher is reading excerpts from T.S. Eliot which kind of make the film seem like it's actively trying for more openings of different interpretations but that is absolutely forgivable. It's usually better to have a horror film try to overthink something than think too little about it.  There's also a very bittersweet love story and coming-of-age story mixed in with the terror which is a very nice touch that especially co-stars Monroe and Gilchrist work incredibly well. Speaking of Monroe, this is a really tour-de-force performance for a young person in a horror film. More often than not lately, we've been getting a lot of YA PG-13 ""horror"" films, but they've been all remakes or sequels or what-have-you. Very few have also tried to deal with being a teen in an honest way, which is reminiscent of what Joss Whedon did with BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER by using the horror and the monsters as stand-ins for the pitfalls and dangers of being a teenager.

The interpretations of the film are numerous; is it about AIDS or some other dangerous STD or the dangers of teen pregnancy or the sexual revolution or... there seem to be so many. The point is that this film creates this opportunity to imagine or to think about different ideas about what message, if any, the film is trying to convey. But one thing that everyone should be able to agree with is that Maika Monroe is just amazing as Jay and Gilchrist is excellent as the love-lorn Paul. I hope to see much more of their work in the future.

IT FOLLOWS is a rare horror film that can be seen for its many layers, or just taken on its own as a terrifying experience, and it's up to the viewer to determine their own input.",1440892800,3,3862,4.51931330472103

7085564,2,B00VAVNN5W,"I've just read some of the 5 star reviews for this film, and their salivating high praise for a mediocre film tells me they haven't watched a good variety of horror films. And I don't mean variety as in all 78 of the jason freddy movies you can pick from. I'm talking euro horror and asia from the 60's on etc. Somebody said in their review that this was the Shining meets Virgin Suicides?? what were they smoking? I read about the hype surrounding this film back when it was just leaving the theaters. It seemed like an interesting premise that you could really run with and they had an ode to 80's scores like Carpenter's stuff and maybe Claudio Simonetti (Argento/Goblin) which seemed cool. And above all it was refreshing to see a film maker who wasn't trying to do that over played shaky camera strapped to your cheeseburger hat effect like the Paranormal films and every other copy cat film like it. All those pov haunting films blow big time.
So I watched It Follows last night and I thought it was going to be pretty good. I had seen the Director's previous film that sleepover flick, whatever it's called. That was ok but it didn't really go anywhere and it was really flat in terms of pacing and anything really interesting going on. So I had some mild reservations that the director would repeat the same things in It Follows. And yep after thirty minutes into the film it became just like the sleepover pacing.
It starts out with a strong opening with a girl who is in the middle of some heavy drama as she is being followed by ""It."" There's some good suspense and the inescapable nightmare that she is caught up in is visualized well. The film score pairs well with the visuals. Her post run in with ""It"" shows about the most gore you will ever see for the entire film. The next scenes of Jay going on a date with the mystery guy are also really good. There are some nice creepy, suspenseful touches of the mystery guy in the midst of total paranoia that ""It"" is following him on his date. He's restless and fidgety and his paranoia transfers over well. Jay has no clue what's in store for her so it adds to the mounting tension. After she sleeps with the guy and is informed by paranoid boy that now she will be followed, it starts to lose steam.

I won't go into a full on breakdown review but the film just lost it after the opening. There's a lot of repetition in the film. the pacing and editing is really static and slow and it's the same throughout the entire film. It's this slow medium pace whether it's the actor's sitting around talking in front of the tv or Jay running for her life. The scenes of her being followed are all very similar and each scene looks like the one before it. It becomes dull and predictable. The music score that seemed promising becomes a real one trick pony. There's the opening theme and the chase theme when it appears. The chase theme sounds the most like a John Carpenter score from Halloween. Those two themes are played to death. The music wasn't all that cool after hearing it more. It sounds like Carpenter lite. Like a thin digital new agey take on 80's soundtracks. There could have been more variation on the music and sound design. I don't get how she keeps sleeping with her best friends to get ""It"" to stop following her and knowingly puts them in harms way instead of sleeping with some fist pumping jersey shore, frat boy douche. The last friend she sleeps with has one-itis. He's the stereotypical ""nice"" guy who gets used as a human doormat by women and gladly obliges. he's the one that's been wanting her for years and waiting for that window to open so he can get in her pants. He's really creepy. He's almost more creepy than the guy who slept with her in the beginning and the thing that's following her. He's not far from the date rape guy at a keg party. And as the film wraps up they do things that you've seen in other horror films to bring out and try and capture or put an end to the creature that's bumming their lives out. The middle to the end of this film just loses everything it had going for it. The opening scenes were strong. I wouldn't say amazing but it had my interest. I wish the rest of it could have matched the beginning.
A lot of reviews called this film sooo ""Original"" its really a take on Carpenter's/Hawks the ""Thing"" and ""They Live."" With the sex angle being a fresher take to bring to it. Especially the themes from the Thing where you don't know who could be the thing or when it's coming. They never showed any of her family or friends becoming the ""It "" that's following her which would've made for more tension and break up the repetition. The director should have stolen that from the Thing.",1440633600,2,4699,4.388761467889908

7085566,5,B00VAVNN5W,"This is one of the best horror movies in the recent years. Some reviewers on here are saying it is not a ""revalation,"" and it is not supposed to be.

Some shots are even analogous across the movies, such as the lead sitting at her school desk and seeing her follower outside the window.
It Follows is not a simple throwback movie though, it is unique and unnerving. After watching it my friends and I spent a lot of time discussing our own theories and possible methods of dealing with the monster of the movie. Throughout the whole me we kept trying to find the monster in every shot-it almost felt like we were more paranoid than some of the characters.

7085600,1,B00VAVNN5W,"It starts out with some random teen girl named Annie running around in her slip, going home after which she's still in her slip, driving to the beach, and calling her father to apologize for her typically lousy behavior.  The next day she's found looking as if she died from doing yoga poorly as she's lying there with one of her legs broken pointing to her head.  No doubt both a bad special effect as well as a ridiculous looking death to be sure.  As the movie goes on we're introduced to our beautiful main character Jay.  While she's lounging in a swimming pool, she lets her sister know that she won't be joining her or her friends in their movie night as Jay has a date with some guy named Hugh.  Hugh seems weird at first while their at the theater,  he claims to see a woman in yellow that only he can see, awkwardness ensued, the date comes to an abrupt ending.  The next outing the two have sex in the car. Soon after sex, Hugh chloroforms Jay, ties her up while still in her underwear, only to tell her about some mysterious shape shifting being that since they've had sex will follow her in any form of its choosing and also gives mention that if she ever ends up dead in some way, it will come after Hugh next.

All that happens after that is Jay and her friends just drive around and stare aimlessly from place to place.  They also have one moment too many of simple minded dialogue that amounts to very little, to say nothing of the ho hum and badly written script.  Even worse the characters are all one-dimensional and the actors performances are nothing but wooden and standoffish.  There's not much continuity from scene to scene either.  There's a scene where Jay just walks in a lake while looking at some people in a boat and the scene is quickly cut to her driving. What?!  There's a scene where she's talking with this guy who likes her in a bedroom and once he asks Jay, if she remembers where they made out, the scene is abruptly ended.  It steals from the original Halloween(1978) when the score not only comes off like it's trying to rip-off John Carpenter's original theme.  To make things worse, there are scenes where the similar tune plays while Jay sees mysterious people moving around as she looks out the window.  And yes one of them features her looking out the window while she's at school.  Coincidence, I think not.  The score by this composer simply known as Disasterpeace, is uneven.  It goes from an  awesome retro 70's and 80's synth sound to just plain loud and melodramatic.  There are far too many scenes where nothing happens and there's no dialogue at all.  To say nothing of one scene too many of one or more of the characters lying down or driving seemingly long distances.  Also, all of those uneventful and redundant scenes go on forever.  The being that follows Jay around remains a very dull mystery.  By that I mean, that: it never talks, it's motive(s) are not at all clear, it's never clear as to what it even is, it takes totally random human forms, who the people are that it takes forms of is also not at all clear, why it even chooses the human forms that it does is unclear, why it takes forms to begin with when the victim, such as Jay, already knows that the listless human form the victim sees is this mysterious being is beyond me, how it gets spread like an STD to the next person is unclear also, and finally it just strikes at very random times for no clear rhyme or reason.  In short, everything this evil entity does, what it is, and its motives are all never explain.

All of this movie's failure to be entertaining boil down to this: It's just not clear as to what the hell is going on in this movie,  This plot(if you call it that) is just as dull and confusing as the characters and what they were doing, the pacing is slow and plodding, there are far too many plot holes, it's neither exciting nor scary, the acting is as bland as a glass of Vichy,  Every time some guy has sex with Jay,  they always look bored and unemotional both during and after sex, the sex scenes are neither sexy nor sensual.  the characters are all one dimensional, the villain is boring, confusing, and left way too mysterious to the point of never being explained fully, The ending is incomprehensible, corny, and not very clear.

If you enjoy horror movies that have interesting characters, a fun, interesting, and comprehensible plot, that are well edited, that are gory, that have good special effects, a plot that goes actually somewhere,  that has an interesting villain, a unique concept, and creative ideas, well then you best skip this total waste of time.",1440288000,7,4618,4.45952380952381

I had a hard time following the dialog, we had to rewind several scenes and eventually put the captions on.  I wanted to know more about the connection between the characters and why the origin of the curse and why the demons manifest themselves the way they do. I like how the movie was filmed in a kind of unnamed era - it was kind of modern day but you could tell it wasn't because there wasn't a single digital device in the sets and the music was an ode to the old '80s slasher films.

7085685,4,B00VAVNN5W,"Is this movie a modern classic like most of the critics claim? I personally say no.

This movie is going to go down as one of the greatest horror movies of the 21st century, but being totally honest, that line up thus far is weak. It Follows is a good movie that keeps a constant sense of dread persisting throughout.

Considering you likely know the plot already, I'll just chalk it up to pros and cons.

PROS:
Good acting (++)
Great cinematography (++)
Great score (++)
Good writing (+)
Great directing (+++)
Sense of fear present from the get-go (++)
Sense of real friendship between characters (++)
Tense-filled, yet unrealistic climax (+)

CONS
Stupid characters (-)
Hair-brained schemes (--)
Bland special effects (-)

If you subtract the total of pluses from the total of minuses, you get a total of 11 for the movie. What does this mean? I don't know. This is an arbitrary scoring method I'm using to keep track of what's good about the movie and what's not, so don't look at it for anything more than a score board.

I'll tell you this much, the movie is well done. It's a thriller, but personally, calling it ""horror"" is almost too much of a stretch for me. There were very few times where I would've used the word ""horror"" to describe the movie.

It Follows went out on a limb by not providing arbitrary jump scares throughout like most horror movies, instead focusing on the slow buildup that can be either hit or miss. This was the first movie that I've seen attempt it that landed somewhere in the middle. On the one hand, the idea is terrifying and can be built up to a terrifying climax. On the other hand, the lack of knowing anything about ""It"" leads us to not really having any type of clue why the kids thought their climactic plan would work, given other, arguably deadlier methods had failed spectacularly. While the climax left me in a state of fear, it never brought me to terror like it could have, and should have.

To sum It Follows up... This is a movie that is good on a date. It's scary enough to keep you close to your significant other, but not so scary that you might embarrass yourself in front of them. It's not some intellectual piece that leaves you pontificating the meanings of life, nor is it a brain dead farce that leaves you craving more popcorn and a cola from that product placement the director thought oh so cleverly inconspicuous. This is a movie that straddles the line between greatness and anonymity and decided to just stay there. This is a movie that is good going into blind, but doesn't deserve the hype.

All in all, I enjoyed this movie, but I don't expect my grandchildren to be hailing it as one of the greatest horror movies of all time, as many critics would have us believing.",1439510400,,2738,4.492957746478873

7085722,3,B00VAVNN5W,"If you're a teenager in a horror movie who has sex, it follows that Bad Things Happen. But what if you're just an ordinary teenager who haplessly commits the misdemeanor of Having Sex While in a Horror Movie, before you know it's a horror movie? Must you pay with your life? The distinction is subtle, and It Follows explores that distinction rather cleverly, with teens who look like teens, talk like teens and act like teens. They're pretty good eggs, natural and likeable. It's a refreshing detour from the screechy archetypes played by models and bodybuilders ten years too old in most horror movies, who can be so unsympathetic you wonder: do the screenwriters have any kids of their own? And if so, do they hate them? Admittedly we don't learn enough about these kids to quite care what happens to them, except for Paul (Kier Gilchrist) and his unrequited crush.  And Makia Monroe looks just right, but is a little too langorous; I missed the mildly sardonic edge she brought to The Guest. Still, we do wonder what we'd do in these kids' shoes, facing what they face. Critics have fallen over each other to praise It Follows' subtexts and Deeper Meanings, perhaps led on by the double-entendre title. But this movie myth can be enjoyed just as much (maybe better) as itself... a simple ghost story, simply told.  We learn pretty early on what the monster is and does, and the story stays true to its own supernatural logic. Its self-awareness is barely there, and is largely (I think) in the critics' imagination. (Which is not a bad thing; a good movie can offer different rewards to different viewers.) This is the first horror movie I can think of since the terrific ""Pulse"" (the Japanese original, NOT the Hollywood remake) where the monster gets scarier the more you see of it. The rest of the frame looks great too... an autumn-tinged, oddly creepy suburbia, bathed at night in the orange haze of sodium streetlamps. It's a nice antithesis to that bleak, drained blue-greenish sepia wash that took over the genre about ten years ago. It Follows isn't as profound as the crits wanted it to be, and eventually trails off a bit, but it's refreshing and mostly effective.",1439337600,,2179,4.731578947368421

7085759,5,B00VAVNN5W,"Easily one of the scariest movies I've seen in a decade. Creepy as hell, great score and brilliant camera work combine to create something I can only assume people felt after watching Jaws for the first time: a mundane activity (in this case being in a house, on a beach, or anywhere) coated with the dread of knowing an unstoppable force is coming for you in a straight line and will not stop until you are dead. This is the kind of rare movie that relies on setting to find the scares rather than nonsensical jump scares that are mainstays of the current genre. True fact: after watching this movie, I was afraid of the dark corners of my house for about two days. This movie plays on our imbedded fears perfectly. Every camera angle is meant to focus not on the creature but the mostly oblivious people it is stalking. Every horrifying moment is rammed home with the same message: death is coming and only you can save yourself. Outside of some acting missteps early in the movie (some of the main character's friends are nothing but filler), this is the closest thing I've seen to a perfect horror movie.",1439078400,,1108,4.517412935323383

7085766,2,B00VAVNN5W,"Given the plethora of good reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and one of the best horror-movie premises in years, I fully expected to love ""It Follows.""  Instead, the maddeningly slow pace, surprising paucity of suspenseful moments, anticlimactic climax, and missed opportunities left me wishing David Robert Mitchell had sold the premise to a team that could have done more with it.

First, the good:  the film is well-acted across the board, and the film has an appealing retro feel to it (helped considerably by the synthesizer-heavy soundtrack).  There are some genuinely creepy moments, such as the first appearance of ""it"" in the guise of an old woman in tattered clothes.

But the bad outweighs the good here.  I respect the attempt to slow-play the premise, but Mitchell overdoes it, leading to long periods where the movie is just plain boring.  Though it is true that monsters are often scarier when they're in the shadows, it feels like the monster here gets about ten minutes of screen time in a 100-minute movie.  Most of the rest of the movie is spent with the main characters engaging in hand-wringing about how to resolve the cursed Jay's quandary, even though she was told in the first ten minutes of the movie how to transfer the curse to someone else.  And the main characters are surprisingly unimaginative about ways to solve the problem - anyone with a triple-digit IQ should be able to think of several ways that Jay, an attractive young female, could put several people between herself and the curse.  (A day on the set of a porn movie or an evening in a swingers' club would do the trick, one would think.)  Instead, the main characters act as though the two male leads - the local lothario and Jay's love-struck longtime friend - are the only two men on earth who would consider sleeping with an attractive, college-aged blonde woman.  Also, the retro ambiance of the movie occasionally veers into so-bad-it's-good territory - and that's not a good thing.

Probably my biggest complaint is the number of opportunities the filmmakers missed here.  For example, Jay's friends are quick to believe that she's contracted a sexually-transmitted haunting and is being followed by something only she can see; it would have been far more interesting to have Jay's friends (and even Jay herself) spend a considerable portion of the movie doubting her sanity.  In fact, the movie could have kept the audience wondering whether Jay was hallucinating the entire thing, a la ""American Psycho.""  Instead, it is made very clear early on, both to us and to Jay's friends (who inexplicably can interact with ""it"" but not see it), that Jay is not crazy.  This feels like a huge missed opportunity.  Also, while I know this was a low-budget movie, it would have been great to expand the cast beyond the main characters for there to be more opportunities for ""it"" to take on the form of people Jay knows.  This could have led to the characters using code words and other methods for Jay to determine whether the people around her were not ""it.""

In sum, this isn't a particularly bad movie, but it isn't a good one either, and it suffers mightily in comparison to this amazing, suspenseful movie that all the critics seem to have watched.",1438992000,6,3236,4.796396396396396

One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand. Ultimately this is what It Follows is all about. And for the writer/director this film appears to be personal.

Much ballyhoo has been batted around about how the film is one of the scariest movies ever made and to some degree this is trueif you keep in mind this is not a horror story but rather a love story disguised as one. Its this peculiar twist which what makes the film stands apart from the other horror garbage on the market.

7085837,1,B00VAVNN5W,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie based on the reviews that I had read.  I was severely disappointed.  This movie is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Acting: The acting in this movie is some of the most disingenuous I have ever seen.  The actors are completely unconvincing and terrible at delivering their parts.  Its almost as if they thought the movie was going to be terrible and didn't care to try.

Plot:  *Minor Spoiler* I'm sorry but what kind of a plot involves an unknown entity that follows you around and the only way you can get rid of it is to have sex with someone?!?!?!?  That is a plot line that a 14 yr old boy comes up with! Give me a break people, you have to have a better imagination than that.  Not only that but every cliche imaginable presents itself in this movie.

Scare Factor:  Zero....LESS than Zero!  There is nothing, and I mean nothing scary about this movie.  The whole premise is this slow moving ""something"" that you cant ever run away from.  This movie never presents this in a remotely scary way.

This film was as unimaginative as it was low budget.  Its a waste of 2 hours of your life. You will get more scare factor out of ""Shrek"" than you will ""It Follows"".",1438646400,7,1243,4.362445414847161

Also the simple premise of the movie alone is what I feel lends it a lot of its weight. It isn't bogged down by a long list of idioms and explanation. You are told just enough to understand what is going on with ""it"" and off the movie goes.
Now, I know that many viewers are torn with horror like this, where the movie doesn't have a slap you in the face definitive ending, and we are ultimately never told the origins of ""It"" or exactly what ""it"" is. But to me this is good Horror telling, Horror is not supposed to be feel good, nor is it supposed to answer all of our questions. Arguably one of the reasons we are attracted to horror in the first place is to have a peak behind the curtain into the supernatural, to see the ""forbidden"" from a safe distance if you will. I applaud the writer and director, and am very excited to see what other offerings come later from either!

7085847,4,B00VAVNN5W,"The spectrum of horror movie fans and/or people who would watch a movie like this is very broad. Some people just want to watch a flick like this with their girlfriend/boyfriend for the jump scares, others just want to watch a movie like this in hopes that they will see a host of teenagers slashed to ribbons, but some want to see a well developed story with a creepy atmosphere.

There is no 'one size fits all' in the horror genre. Everyone likes something different. In saying that you have to take this movie for exactly what it is. It is a low budget ($2M) atmospheric horror/thriller, filled with unknowns and written and directed by an ""unknown"" filmmaker, who won't be unknown for much longer.

Don't read too much into the approach, this is one of the most unique horror movies to come out this millennium. Let me reiterate, I am NOT saying this is the best horror movie of the 21st century, I'm saying it is one of the more unique horror movies of the past 15 years. Not a slasher per se, supernatural in that something is happening that can not be explained by science but not a fantasy and no technical possessions (that we know of at least).

If you want cheap thrills, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. If you want to see tons of blood and gore, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. If you just want to see a slew of teenagers being massacred, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. However if you want to see something different done in this genre, someone taking horror back to being an art of pacing, the creation of an atmosphere (very well illustrated by Disasterpeace's score) that is all together unsettling, WATCH THIS MOVIE.

The fast food, You Tube crowd that is handing out 1 star reviews can not possibly begin to appreciate something like this. Taking into account what I have told you, if you think this movie may be a good fit for you, watch IT for yourself.",1438473600,4,1853,4.4411764705882355

7085851,4,B00VAVNN5W,"The film, It Follows, is not The Omen or The Exorcist or even Fright Night.  It's a small budget film (two million dollars is the estimate) that has not only broke even, but actually made a good profit for its studios.

True, there are goofs in the film.  One critic mentioned the swimming pool in the abandoned building near the end of the movie.  For an abandoned building, the pool was spotless and the water warm and clear like people had been swimming in it every single day.  In fact, the pool should've been empty and run down.  Another goof the critic caught was also in the same scene when one of the main characters brings a small box with electrical cords in it, along with a few other items to prepare for the coming attack.  There should be only about six-to-twelve feet of cord in a box or case that size, but the kids used close to a hundred feet to plug in the electrical items and then set them down near the edge of the pool.

The real question, however, is whether the film is any good or not?

For me, it was.

I don't know if others will enjoy the movie, though some clearly have when the gross amount of sales is added.  I had fun with it and was sitting on the edge of my seat in a number of scenes, thinking to myself, ""Don't open the door!""

I wasn't sure if the movie would do this for me, but I found myself addicted to what was happening after the first ten-to-fifteen minutes.  Some of the film didn't make a lot of sense to me, but the director/writer (David Robert Mitchell) was able to capture the essence of what horror is supposed to be in a film of this type.

Ratchet up the suspense and the scare factor for the viewers!

As most readers will already know, the plot is centered on a teenager, Jay (she reminded me a bit of Reese Witherspoon), and what happens when she has sex with her new boyfriend.  He clearly passes something on to her, but it's much worse than a STD.  What transpires is that Jay now sees zombie-like creatures coming for her, and she's the only one who can actually see them, other than previous people in the chain of sexual encounters.

Her sister and high school friends can't see the dead people and think she's hallucinating.  In time, they have to take Jay at her word, which is a challenge for the first three-quarters of the film.  Some of her friends nearly get killed when she's shooting at the zombies.

By the end of the film, everyone has teamed up to put a stop to Jay being hunted, though I'm not sure a bullet to the head would stop these zombies.  Maybe cut the heads off?  I mean the people are already dead.  Therefore, another way has to be found to stop them.

I have a feeling this will be answered in the sequel.  Yes, there will be a sequel.  The film broke even, plus made a profit.  The studios will therefore put up more money for the sequel and look forward to a larger slice of the pie.

Though low budget in scope, It Follows still succeeds on the fright barometer.  Naturally, some horror fans won't like it, but others will.  I would definitely watch the sequel when it comes out.

There's one last thing I want to mention about the Blu-ray edition of It Follows.  Except for two Commentaries on the film and an Interview with the gentleman who did the score, there are no other Behind-the-Scenes stuff, unless you count the Trailers.  I thought this was unusual for a Blu-ray DVD.  Usually a horror film will have tons of Behind-the-Scenes documentaries on the Blu-ray edition because the fans love that.

I certainly do.",1438473600,,3514,4.36055469953775

7085858,1,B00VAVNN5W,"I chose to rent this because I read all the reviews of it on VUDU from critics we've all heard of. Why do I not learn my lesson after all this time? One critic said she thought it was the scariest movie she had seen in many years. Others had similar opinions. I can only assume as I have of late and what has been suspected by many other film enthusiasts, that when films that are obviously just ok or are just plain bad are getting rave reviews from well known critics, you begin to really want to support allegations that big critics might be getting paid to praise movies that otherwise would be getting lackluster reviews? And why not? It is a fact that average people reviewing products right here on amazon, people like you and me, are sometimes paid for a very positive opinion, leaving shining remarks about products, so why not pro critics who are paid anyway and that many people trust?

I remember when Gravity was getting all these nominations and rave reviews calling it a modern day masterpiece, this good but only a little above average Sci-fI flick was also suspected of receiving reviews that got there because someone was paid to write it all. It was not a bad movie at all, but the only Oscar it really deserved to be nominated for was for special effects, which were actually not bad. But best picture? Best actress? And the truth is quite often the script was downright horrible, and Clooney's acting was pretty mundane. Bullock was fine, but nothing here suggests anything worthy of a nomination. And all the other nominations it got? well  had not only me but many tens of thousands of people also wondering what the hell was going on.

It's a new age folks. Movie studios and producers know that marketing is everything. And even more importantly rave reviews from respectable critics make for even better marketing. Since the days of Siskel and Ebert, people have first hand experience with just how effective a popular critic's review really can be. Through the 80's and 90's if Siskel and Ebert gave a film ""Two thumbs up!"" the movie would go places, if it got ""Two big thumbs way up!"" It made a lot of money. They had real power back then. History that works is well worth investing in - no?

And I wonder what Siskel and Ebert would have said about this movie? Even the splat reviews were not all that condemning at VUDU. So what is going on here? I have no clue. What I can tell you is my opinion. Which by now should be worth something. I've been watching horror films since I was an 8 year old in the 60's. I've seen everything under the sun. From classic Hammer horror to 80's teen horror, to extreme Asian horror, to torture porn and beyond, and even the classic ones from the golden age and the underground nasties. Having said that here is my over all impression for what it is worth..

The movie feels very academic at times. Even amateurish for several reasons. The music on it's own is quite good, but dated. That might be suggested due to the fact that everyone has little old CRT TV's. Well is this intended to take place in the 80's maybe early 90's? If so then why are the police cruisers in the film all Crown Vic P71's which did not get used by most law enforcement until well into 2001? Continuity I realize, but still. So that aside what about the ""Followers""? Well that right there ruined it for me. Cheesy retreads who look like they are right out of the original Night of the Living Dead, only with all their limbs intact, and not rotting. Add in some cheap creeps by providing some very cheesy black eye makeup and give them some very stupid growls and blank stares? What you have looks like a couple of 10 year old's making their first experimental horror movie at 8 and 10 years old. These ""Followers"" are about as interesting or scary as a bowel movement. They are not creepy in the least. And even one Follower apparently was really scary! For what ever reason the director/ writer thought it would be really creepy to have her pee her self.

Back to the music. Sometimes it does not fit. Sometimes it is over dramatic, and sometimes it's just plain annoying. The acting? Sometimes it's quite good. Other times it's about as wooden as a bedroom set of expensive oak furniture. I could go on, but I'm telling you, the film is just ok. It's often kind of good, other times laughable, and other times somewhat interesting. Is it worth seeing? Depends on who you are. If you're not a seasoned horror veteran or some teen that doesn't know a good scare from an episode of Scooby Doo might like this. Otherwise my advice is to skip it",1438387200,8,4583,4.469534050179211

7085880,3,B00VAVNN5W,"I liked the premise after seeing the trailer. However, what I imagined in my head for this film was much more terrifying than it actually was.  That being said, there were a few strokes of genius in it. You're constantly scanning the entire background of each shot on your guard looking for danger. Unfortunately, the film started out well and never totally found it's footing for me. Here's where the director got the idea for the film, which many of us could relate to. He said, as many story tellers have done, that this came from a common reoccurring nightmare many of us have experienced. His particular dream was when he was at a playground with his friend, and suddenly noticed a 10 year old kid walking ominously towards him. No one else noticed this kid, but he just knew ""this kid is a monster and wants to hurt me."" It's that moment a normal dream, suddenly turns into a nightmare. He runs away and looks back, sure enough, seeing this kid rounding the corner still after him, knowing he's not going to stop chasing him. Cool idea, but his execution was flawed.

*spoilers kinda

While it's a pretty terrifying premise, I feel like he could have done better because there were too many inconsistencies. Sometimes it shape shifted for seemingly no reason. The rules for the creature were too plentiful and cumbersome. Only the people infected can see it, but others can interact with it. One minute a bullet can't take it down, but the next it may have permanently. They also never seemed to really take advantage of that characteristic. I feel like either everyone should have been able to see it but it could disguise itself (a la the T1000), or no one else should have been able to see or interact with it at all except those infected because of all the questions it raised about it. Like why did it get back up the first time it was shot, but possibly not the second? It also makes changing its appearance much less effective if no one else can see it. For example, I was expecting a clever scene where it looks like one of her friends or teacher or a nurse to get close and the strike, but instead we got a scene where it turned into one of her friends and simply walked up behind her without her even noticing, which made it kind of pointless to change into one of her friends at all since she didn't even see it coming. It seemed like many missed opportunity for some terrifying scenes, where someone isn't who they think, which would have given us throwbacks to John Carpenter's The Thing. Also, why change into something like a naked woman? That's obviously going to stand out in a crowd and raise some red flags before it gets anywhere near her. Many unanswered questions, and failed opportunities. I also thought it would change into something more horrific looking when it finally captured its victims, but alas it never did. Is this required? No, but I felt it would have been more effective. Lastly, since they obviously couldn't kill it successfully before, I wonder why they never tried trapping it instead of trying to kill it again...

Even with all of these problems, it is an ambitious and interesting horror film, but could have been executed better. The ending scene was pretty excellent because of how it left it open ended. Is it still after them or are you just being paranoid?",1438214400,,3312,4.570707070707071

The victim of course being the poor unfortunate that had sex with the previous unfortunate victim who, in a dispicable show of poor character, had sex with the new victim to get the 'follower' of his or her back.  Its a melange of strange premises include sort of a gypsy curse, with a changeable zombie like 'follower', and a twist on the standard curse in that you really can't get the follower off your back no matter how many degrees of separation you put between you and the thing since every time it kills the current victim, it then turns its attention on the previous target.

There are some interesting ideas at play, but the world is lacking clarity and dimension. Some of the haziness is good (there's no clear path to success for the films protagonists, which turns out to be very intentional), but some of the ambiguity just feels sloppy and unspecific. For example, I watched this film with a pretty savvy group of people (professors and theater professionals), and everyone agreed that the films ideas/agenda/pov felt unclear.

Perhaps most dishearteningly, I never found the film to be the least bit scary.

7085918,5,B00VAVNN5W,"This movie is clearly inspired by a slew of early 80s slasher flicks following the trope ""If you have sex you die.""  Shades of Halloween with it's suburban landscape playing on a continuous loop being stalked by an unstoppable evil, Nightmare of Elm Street where no-one is safe behind their perfect white picket fences and there's a conspicuous absence of parental figures, the Thing with it identity paranoia, and even Carrie.

The cinematography is gorgeous.  It has an eye for impeccable compositions and gorgeous color.  The extra-wide aspect accents the symmetric compositions prevalent through the whole movie.  The director manages to keep the audience's paranoia going as well with well composed shots always alluding that the characters are never safe.

The movie's pace is a wonder, keeping the story moving along and the tension going until the last frame.

The only bad things I have to say is the soundtrack.  It's clearly riffing on John Carpenter's cheezy synthesizer scores, but they can be overwhelming at times.  I suppose it could have been worse and Hans Zimmer could have done the score.  The choice of props was also very distracting.  There were so many anachronistic props thats it was clear the director was trying to defy placing the story in a specific time period.  Modern e-readers were being used right next to obsolete CRT televisions and mint-condition 70s hotrods were on the street next to 10s family sedans.

It had that '80s feel to it, from the electric piano soundtrack to the wall phones etc. That's fine, and the overall plot idea had potential. A teenage girl goes on a date and has sex in the backseat, only to be abducted and told by this desperate fellow that he's passed something on to her - a curse that involves being followed by some sort of entity that can take on any human appearance. It doesn't move quickly, but it is relentless, and he tells her, ""Don't let it touch you."" Which was one problem I had. It does touch her, and yet she gets away (hope that wasn't a spoiler). Anyhow, like the entity itself, the story shambles along relentlessly while the group of friends makes an attempt to get rid of the creature, which only the infected can see, with predictably poor results. There's one scene where the girl goes to the beach and sees some guys in a boat, strips down and presumably swims out to them...and...well, that plot line is left completely dangling. Did she have sex with them? Did she just go for a swim, as her dripping arm cast indicates? Did the director completely forget about this scene? Is it meant to lead to a sequel? Who knows. As the movie stumbles to a dull finish, we were left wondering what the point was. Maybe it was meant to be a metaphor about STDs? That's my best guess.",1438214400,4,1474,4.383211678832117

7085938,1,B00VAVNN5W,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever watched, and I don't know how it gets any decent much less great reviews. First of all the movie looked like it was shot with a handheld video camera and the lighting was pretty bad. They must have had five dollars worth of funding for this movie. The storyline was also very stupid, its about a thing that follows you and gets passed around like a STD. You can only get it or get rid of it by sleeping with someone. The storyline was also unrealistic, they are teenagers and their parents don't notice when they run screaming out of the house or when they don't come home for two days. A lot of the movie just consist of  trying without succeeding to build up the tension and only manages to irritate the viewers with the annoying repetitive music that the constantly play throughout the movie. I forced myself to watch it seeing as I paid for it. I spent the majority of the time hoping that it would by some miracle turn into at least a watchable movie but it was so boring the whole time that I wanted to turn it off, and by giving it a chance I almost bored myself to sleep. The ending of the movie was inconclusive and didn't really have an ending it just kinda stopped without finishing right in the middle of the scene. I though it had messed up until it started rolling credits. I really feel like I wasted my money because when I looked through reviews it said it was a good movie.

7085956,5,B00VAVNN5W,"At first blush, I liked this movie. I didn't love it. The movie ended, and I just thought, ""Meh."" I thought some of the acting was off, and a bit wooden. Some of the shots felt a little like ""Look who went to film school!""

But just like the titular character, the idea of this movie followed me. I love that they refused to really place the movie temporally. In some scenes I thought, ""Oh! It's the 80's."" In others, the sets/settings looked more contemporary. It disconcerted me, which I think made the movie more effective overall. I also thought the music was pretty good or, at any rate, it also stuck with me.

But most of all, the CONCEPT of the film stuck with me. Sure, the pointed reference to the horror movie trope of the sexually active female being singled out for punishment is a bit obvious, but it's done very originally and, for me, terrifyingly. Some of the scariest movies, in my opinion, are ones about ghosts and/or possession, in large part because there is often no physical proof that there is anything else at work than the insanity of the sufferer. This movie tapped into that fear for me, VERY effectively. For a solid week, and still occasionally, I watched strangers on the street, and looked over my shoulder in my apartment, expecting to seem a looming, hollow-eyed figure, moving toward me inexorably.

I actually originally rated this as four stars, but as I wrote this review I realized that I was saying more of what I loved than didn't, so I added the extra star. I would still say it's somewhere in the four-and-a-half range for me, but definitely worth a watch, especially if you like classic horror.",1437955200,,1639,4.587030716723549

7085959,5,B00VAVNN5W,"This movie gets five stars easily.  I love the genre and this movie delivers on originality and legitimate creepiness, which few do anymore.  Very few movies creep me out, but this one succeeded.

To the reviewers that allege this film lacks originality, is too slow, acting is lackluster, or ""tried to hard"" - I say you are wrong.  What isn't original about this movie?  The premise is entirely novel.  The pacing was also appropriate, as this wasn't a hack and slash horror movie or a ""ah! Something just jumped out of the shadows!"" flick.  It's a smarter, more deliberate movie.  The acting was perfect.  The cast are supposed to be inexperienced high school students, not emotionally mature adults with life experience.  They capture their irrational and immature roles very well.  With regard to ""trying too hard,"" give me a break.  This clearly wasn't shot on a big budget.  Neither did it have over the top special effects.  To critique its soundtrack for trying to be a classic horror movie only showcases those reviewers' insecurity that movies like this could displace older movies (who many consider the holy grail of the genre).

If you don't like this movie because it didn't scare you or it wasn't what you thought it would be, that's fine.  It wasn't for you.  Personal taste /expectations are just that - personal.  However, I take issue with trashing this movie for any of the reasons listed above.

The central conceit of catching a ""ghostly STD"" that curses the victim with an entity who can take the appearance of any person they might know while relentlessly following them until it catches and kills them, didn't really grab my attention. It just didn't seem like a creepy premise, I mean not a lot of suspense if the protagonist can easily outrun a monster that doesn't even look disturbing. And oh boy, was I wrong! The filmmakers are very talented and it shows from the great look of the movie to just how much suspense and atmosphere they managed with a concept that sounds like a better fit for a cheap B-movie.

7085973,3,B00VAVNN5W,"I'm a bit mixed about this movie.  On the one hand, it is one of the scariest movies I've seen in a while, and one of the best in recent years.  Unfortunately, it's not one of the best because it's so brilliant, but rather because most films today are so bad.  The very fact that this goes for chills rather than gore sets it above modern day movies, but it does not strive to be more.

First, there's the fact that the filmmakers are so bent on being like the older movies that it tends to copy their styles rather than be original.  This is not always true; some of the camera movements are innovative.  But quite a lot of it, especially in regards to the music and production design, just go retro without any good reason.  I was laughing a lot when the cheesy synthesizer music played.  (Though I must admit that I was cringing sometimes when the monotone electronica played subtly as an undertone.)

It also falls back on a problem with most horror films, the characters do INCREDIBLY stupid things that often cause the problems they get into.  At one point, knowing this thing is after them and how dangerous it is, they leave the door open and all fall asleep.  Characters who are in danger regularly leave their backs to doorways and windows.  It's infuriating and leaves me feeling like they kind of deserve what's coming to them.

Finally, and this is a problem with many YA films and books these days; they forget that these teenagers are kids and leaves the parents out of it.  These kids regularly take off and do whatever they want without the parents stepping in.  The kids have troubles and the parents don't show any concern.  They even wind up in the hospital and no parents are ANYWHERE to be seen.  Who the hell is paying all these bills???  Who owns these houses everyone lives in???  One of the kids is even portrayed as having been on the road for a long time, and then he's back at his mom's place, and she shows no concern about this!  I think teenagers are attracted to this because in their own lives they want to ignore their parents except when they need something from them, and this and many other portrayals of teenagers feeds into this mentality.

However, despite all the criticism, I give this movie a lot of credit for going after suspense and genuine fear rather than gore.  Overall it's a very good, if heavily flawed, film.",1437782400,,2362,4.482435597189696

Basically, it's a recreation of those horrible nightmares most (all) of us have had of being pursued, chased, by something with ill intent. I know those were among the worst of my own nightmares: that thing after me and the heated rush to run or fly away from it (in dreams, sure, you fly).

SPOILERS AHEAD, but only the plot ones you've likely already seen or heard about the basic story premise/consequences:

In this film, it's a haunting that walks, that follows. Unstoppable. It is silent, ruthless, and terrifying, even if it can only make progress at a  particular pace, just walking. It means to kill, though we don't see just how it accomplishes this until nearly the end.

Why it is pursuing? Mystery.
How did it originate? Mystery.

But if you have sex with a haunted person, now you become haunted, and all you can do is run and run or find another person to pass it to and hope they elude the predator. Sort of a horror flick justification for constant one night stands. Never being fully safe. The horror comes from its relentlessness and changeable appearance-- and from never being able to stay still and live normally, always watching and moving, and maybe also the awfulness of having to do the evil thing of ""contaminating"" someone else for some respite. Human frailty and all.

So, for the visuals: I thought this film had a really interesting sort of ""what era is this"" confusion. There is this chronoconfusion: it will look like the seventies and eighties, maybe the sixties. Then they'll have something that looks futuristic (the clamshell digital reader). It sort of connects us to othr horror films of the past dealing with dangerous sex and relentless chases: zombies, Halloween, etc.

There are moments when it's very creepy--and not always from the shapeshifting haunt, but from the things humans will do to find relief from their nightmare.

The final shot speaks of the persistence of danger...how nightmares linger...and perhaps also of the resonance in unwise or risky sex...

I think it's very well done ,and it's the kind of movie that sparks conversation after viewing. And, if we're honest, in an age when there are incurable sexually transmitted diseases, this movie resonates with even greater terrors.",1437696000,2,2639,4.896860986547085

7086002,4,B00VAVNN5W,"""It Follows"" tells its tale in a most unsettling and menacing (and generally quiet) manner that gets under the skin and keeps the viewer wondering ... and creeped out. It reminded me a little of other suspense winners-- like John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" and Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"".

The premise: a female college student named Jay sleeps with her boyfriend and then learns that by having sex with her he has passed on a deadly curse: an evil entity in the form of a person that nobody else can see will slowly stalk her and then kill her unless she passes the curse to another victim. It sounds a bit lame, but the movie rises above the plot with its unique personality and mood.

Although anticlimactic (it has one of those sudden movie endings where you say, It's over??), the film as a thriller is worth a look to fans of macabre movies ... and it has a sense of dread that the rest of the sorry excuses for scary cinema last year wished they'd had. Also, to add to the strangeness of it all, we can't quite place the time period it takes place in; there are cars from the 1980's and today, there's a Kindle type thing but also electric typewriters and rotary corded phones.",1437609600,,1183,4.497674418604651

7086005,2,B00VAVNN5W,"I heard about this while listening to a segment on NPR, and I was totally pumped. It's rare for horror movies to be good, and this sounded like it would be one of the good ones. It wasn't. The entire time I felt like I was watching something should have been made for TV (at movie theater prices). The characters aren't written well enough to be likeable and they take turns passing around the idiot ball rather than trying to solve their life threatening problems and figure out the monster's rules and ways to stop it. The worst part of the entire movie isn't the slow pace and poor characters, but rather the total lack of horror due to terrible cinematography. Every time tension starts to build or a scene threatens to become scary, the camera breaks into slow motion and stares at the monster with up close shots, which kills the mystery and tension. A thing you can't see is scary because your imagination runs wild. A thing you see only briefly in glimpses still has mystery. This movie just stands and stares at the scary thing until you can't take it seriously. The entire movie plays out like an anti-jump scare or kids horror show that is trying its best to not be scary while still being a horror production. The only good thing in this movie are the ideas around how the monster functions. That is scary the longer you think about it, but the execution of this movie revolving around the idea is a total bust.",1437609600,3,1423,4.476923076923077

7086031,1,B00VAVNN5W,"This movie had me extremely intrigued with the trailer (but then don't they all) and it left me with hatred for wasting my time. What the trailer will have you believe is there is an unstobable force that is stalking these teenagers for who knows what reason, but no matter where they go, it knows how to find them, just very slowly.  It has all the build up as an interesting premise for a chase horror movie, but in reality, it's a blatant 100 minute movie trying to scare the tweens to not have sex.
  What really happens is this naive teenager has sex with this guy who she's known for all of a day (from what the movie suggests) and after he's done with her, he kidnapps her and informs her that he has passed on this curse.  The curse can only be seen by the infected people, and it can take the form of anyone, just so it can get close and kill you.  To cut to the chase, this movie is anything but scary.  All the ""chasing"" happens for the most part, in broad daylight.  The movie has a body count of 2, that's right, 2 people.  And to make it worse, after the ""monster"" kills, it has sex with the corpse.  There is no back story of the mysterious force.  There is no justification for it's actions.  It's simply a tale to let you know, sex outside of wedlock is bad, and it has grave consequences.",1437523200,12,1306,4.184

Don't get me wrong, there are some terrifying elements and the idea is a great one. They just could have done so much more with this idea! Most of the movie is very slow and involves the characters sitting around doing nothing. There are 4 or 5 ""scary"" parts in the 100 minute film and they just weren't very impressive.

Watching this movie was almost like going back in time and reminded me of what I loved about these kinds of movies back in those days.  When I look back at the old films by the likes of Wes Craven, John Carpenter and Sam Raimi...I see this film as almost being an homage to those guys in how it was produced.  From the way they used the camera, to the style of music that was used, to the general look and feel of the movie, I felt like this movie was made in the 80's...many of the vehicles used were even older vehicles to give it that same feel.  I've seen many films over the years that tried to copy the same style of Raime and Craven and Carpenter(though not all in the same film), but they simply felt like amateurs trying to copy the masters.  This one didn't, this one was very well done and it was done in a way that made you feel like the filmmakers were as big a fan of those guys as I and many other were, and they truly wanted to do something that those guys could look at and be proud they they may have been an influence to the film.  Now I'm not saying it is as good as those other guy's masterpieces...but after seeing so many crappy horror movies over the years, it was refreshing to not only see one that was very well done, but also one that made me reminisce so many of those great movies done by the master's back in the day.",1437436800,,1433,4.0638297872340425

Writer and director David Robert Mitchell did a magnificent job creating a tense, frightening, and exciting world to delve into for a couple of hours. I saw this in theaters when it came out, and boy did they get it right by putting this in the theaters! It was deemed a total success by all accounts, even with the seemingly ""low profit"" theater run it had. In reality it was very successful and everyone involved was very pleased with the results (even the studios). I had this preordered and was so happy to get it- the film is fantastic, the acting is superb, the story is aces, the extras on the blu ray are beyond awesome, and this entry into the horror world shows that it is still alive and kickin'! Sure, we see these crappy films like THE GALLOWS (you know it's going to be bad when a horror movie has ""Paper Towns"" as one of its theatrical previews), but seeing all of these terrible takes on the genre is well worth it when you get to see a gem like It Follows. The soundtrack was executed masterfully by Disasterpeace and provides a whole different layer to the tense scenes. The more I think about my viewings of this film, the less I can find wrong with it. The truth is that one can only hope David Robert Mitchell can provide even a fraction of the quality of this film in the future, and if he does, then we will all be winners.",1437436800,4,1421,4.345864661654136

They are all zombie like and are throw backs to Romero's Night of the Living Dead walkers.  The young actors actually made you believe that they were frightened and there was no over the top highschool teenage antics anywhere in this movie.

Is there anything good? The concept is not new but its visualization as a movie was good. Unfortunately execution was too bad. At some point this movie sound like and adult movie, but take a turn into a teen movie and go take a route to a kids mid and comeback.

I am not going to stop anybody from watching it. But I ask people to watch it twice so that you can get a good laugh on the dumbness of whatever follows.

For me this is a teen horror in the tradition of Nightmare On Elm Street and its remake, and it is a very good one. There is a killer which can take on the appearance of shapeshifters and doppelgangers when he she or it wishes, but which can be killed just like any killer, as the always perfectly placed camera takes us on a thrilling but well-paced Bluray ride to suburbs, beaches, schools and swimming pools in the Detroit area with the killer nearly always in pursuit.

7086086,5,B00VAVNN5W,"I hate it when Im late to the party, especially when everyone is raving about how much fun the party turns out to be. In any case I finally had the opportunity to see David Robert Mitchells new horror offering It Follows and Im kicking myself for not seeing it sooner.
The web is full of reviews gushing about It Follows. How much it adds to the horror genre. How surprising it is that a low budget film is so provocative. How such a simple idea can be so scary.

It Follows is proof that simple ideas can make the best horror movies.

The premise of the movie is incredibly simple. Jay, played by Maika Monroe (The Guest, Labor Day), learns that shes been infected after having sexual intercourse with Hugh, played by Jake Weary (Zombeavers), and now the infection is following her.

Infected with what you ask? Thats a great question!

Call it a curse. Call it a spirit. Call it a demon. Call it anything you like because any explanation is as good as another. Whats important are the rules. The thing following you is slow, but its not dumb. It is always coming no matter where you are, its always moving toward you. If it gets you then it comes after the person who infected you, then right on down the line. It can look like anybody and only those infected can see it.

It Follows is a beautifully crafted gauntlet of fear, tension, and horror. Many comments online claim the film is slow and boring. Not enough action. Sleep inducing. Nothing special. Yada yada. Take my word for it, its one of the most intense films horror-thrillers since Sinister. Dont let the slow, moody manner of the characters fool you, this movie will stick with you for days. Like an albatross hanging around your neck, you won't be able to get the idea out of your mind. Between Mitchells direction and Monroes sympathetic portrayal of a young woman put in an impossible situation youll find yourself engaged in the story, feeling like you're there next to them.

I watched the movie with my wife, sister-in-law and mother-in-law. All of them enjoy horror movies, but every now and again a film comes along that has them all (including myself) yelling at the television. It Follows is one of those movies. All of us felt Jays burden as she waited for the unknown horror to arrive, again and again and again. Wed yell at the screen if we spied what we believed to be the creature, arriving deep in the background. Getting closer and closer as the characters are focused on anything but their surroundings.

The film capitalizes on this premise with excellent cinematography. From the very first scene its clear we are meant to see more than just the characters. Mitchell wants us to see the environment, the background. A very clever set-up because it lulls the audience into complacency. By the time Jay learns of her plight were already used to the long shots and wide panning camera angles. This makes the first time she sees It even more powerful and creepy.

It Follows is a brilliant film. David Robert Mitchell takes an extremely simple idea and through some deft direction, exception camera work, and provocative soundtrack is able to inject the the film with the most powerful elements of multiple genres. Horror, monster, thriller, and coming-of-age. Thematically the movie is all about the discomfort of adolescence, love, and emotional insecurity.",1437436800,,3341,4.699145299145299

7086092,4,B00VAVNN5W,"There are two kinds of people who watch horror movies. Ones that like a lot of female nudity, and ones that like to be scared. This movie, while really good, is a little bit of a letdown of both in my opinion. On a good note, it isn't stupid scary like the Paranormal Activity series. The story is genuinely good and the effects were well done. The acting was damn good for the age of the actors. But it had it's flaws.

A GREAT horror movie has you jumping in your seat as much as possible. It Follows had two good moments like that for me, but not enough to hold the tension. The main terror of the movie is the creature itself and how close it constantly is. If you are looking for Steven King horror, this movie will be your new best friend. If you are looking for Evil Dead 2/Nightmare On Elm Street kind of scary, you won't be fulfilled.

The soundtrack is a little annoying, getting REALLLLLLLLYYY LOOOOOUUUUDDDD, especially with the ""terror noises"" they put in to let you subconsciously know it's time to be scared. (all movies do it). And it's really 80's sounding. Perhaps it's a nod to the greats of terror, but I like my horror to keep up with the times.

Overall, I was happy to watch the movie, but it wasn't complete satisfaction. And the nudity part? While you get to see the lead girl in plenty of sex scenes, she only gets down to the undies. That said, she looks good in them. Very good in them. She should have went for being a model instead of a b-ish movie actress. There are boobs here and there in the film, but they are creatively attached to the hagish thing that follows them, so this is in no way a date movie, especially when it's single's night. :P

I predict that young actress will make it big, eventually--the camera absolutely devours her and vice versa. There are very brief, brilliant moments in this film that hint at what could have been, and perhaps with just a little more time and development it would have gotten there, but I just get the feeling that the creators were lacking the expertise that comes with experience. I did enjoy the nod to 80's horror: the low budget feel, the suburban setting, the electronica soundtrack, but that's just not enough.

7086103,4,B00VAVNN5W,"Drop this enigmatic little thriller in any 70s or 80s creepfest and not only will its score feel right at home, but the budget and the story-line are likely to as well. The genius of It Follows is in David Robert Mitchell's ability to take every (and I do mean *every*) horror cliche taught in the proverbial Scary Movies 101 class and amplify them with enough pure dread that completing this film is akin to taking a master's class at the University of Psychological Thrillers.

Where the hell did this young pup (Mitchell) come from anyway? And, why have I never heard of him before? He obviously digested ample late-night horror shows as a kid because his knack for cloak-and-dagger paced suspense is remarkable. This is one talented writer/director, Folks. I suspect he is what you'd get if you magically mated John Carpenter and John Hughes. Carpenter for obvious reasons and Hughes for his innate ability to treat his young characters with dignity and a genuine respect for their very real world angst.

Prepare to push past the well-worn ""Casual Sex leads to Death and Despair"" surface and tread into the deeper, more cerebral, waters of the story. It Follows packs plenty of profound notions and shrewd foreshadowing that astute observers may catch the first time around, While childhood fears of water, the woods, abandoned buildings, being home alone, being followed, and the complete unknown morph into adult fears of growing old, being alone, disease, death ...  and, well, the complete unknown. ""It"" appears to be cryptic, but the undeniable dangers of reaching out for forbidden fruit resonates clearly throughout this shudder-producing film.

Caveat for fellow Horror fans: If you're looking for scores of gore, slasherporn, and  jump-out-of-your-seat scares, you best mosey on along. Blood, full frontal nudity, and Night of the Living Dead (1968)  dread all receive adequate screen time, but the main focus is on the tension and anxiety you experience following Jay (deftly portrayed by Maika Monroe) and her small circle of loyal friends. I guarantee you'll be watching the edges of your screen.

Caveat for fellow Suspense fans: This film is a ... slow ... burn. And, yes, there are a few times you'll be asked to suspend your disbelief; but overall, Mitchell's methods work really well.  And the climax is worth the wait.

Bottom Line: What will follow after viewing It Follows is the palpable uneasiness that makes you want to crawl right out of your skin.",1437350400,,2477,4.992718446601942

7086105,5,B00VAVNN5W,"""It Follows"" is great! This is how the story goes: For 19-year-old Jay, fall should be about school, boys and weekends out at the lake. But after a seemingly innocent sexual encounter, she finds herself plagued by strange visions and the inescapable sense that someone, or something, is following her. Jay and her teenage friends must now find a way to escape the horrors that seem to be only a few steps behind.

The cast led by Maika Monroe (as Jay) is great. The directing, story & screenplay by David Robert Mitchell (who also produced the film, as well) is great.

The music by Disasterpiece is great. The cinematography by Mike Gioulakis is great. The film editing by Julio Perez IV is great. The casting by Mark Bennett & Carrie Ray is great. The production design by Michael Perry is great. The art direction by Joey Ostrander is great. The costume design by Kimberly Leitz-McCauley is great.

I don't care if a movie is not perfect or suffers some inconsistencies, all it has to do is entertain me and keep me from hitting the stop button.

I think the acting is good, especially the lead character.  The musical score is reminiscent of the ""Halloween"" movie and it definitely is used to good effect.

I am not sure what all the hype was about for this horror movie. The critics on Rotten Tomato gave it 96% fresh and 66% of the audience liked it. I am definitely more in line with the audience.

Spoilers Ahead

I kept hearing that it was so intense, and that youd be scanning everyone in the background to see who is after the victim. Um, no. It was completely obvious who was after the intended victim. Most of the time the scene was so bare of other people, there was no other choice as to who it would be.

The main characters acting just checked out after she told her friends that something was following her, and when they finally believed her. Jay looked comatose, constantly lying against her friend, or even just straight up sleeping. I would think she would be way more hyped up, on constant alert, and afraid of going to sleep. More like a Nightmare on Elm Street vibe.

You needed to have sex to pass it onto the next person, so the creature would be after them instead of you. What if she were to have sex with three different guys at the same time? (Yes, one in each opening.) Would it pass on to all three of them? It might make me a slut, but I would try it, just on the off chance it worked. The creature having to kill three people before it got back to me is way better odds than just one person.

And the end scene in the pool where the creature is throwing electrical items at Jay. Okay, I suppose I can go with each item coming unplugged from an electrical source before it hit the water. But some of them were on really long extension cords. Every single one the creature threw was on a short cord??

The other thing with the pool, they are in the most run down part of Detroit and every building near by is super run down or vacant/vandalized. But here you have this gorgeous brick building in perfect condition. Even better it has running electricity and a huge, well maintained swimming pool. No. Just No.

And what was up with Jays friends (Annie?) giving a monologue about not being able to go past Eight Mile when she was a kid because thats where the suburbs ended and the bad part of town began. Since the writer is from Michigan, this was his nod to his home state, but it served no purpose to the plot, and in fact just stood out as super odd.

This is such a minor thing, but Jays cast. The first time shes just walking around her pool with the cast on. Thats super fun. At least be on a raft floating around. And then later on shes in actual bodies of water. Even if its a fiberglass one, you are not to get it wet. I know a stupid, picky thing, but just one more thing to add to the list of annoyances.

And where the hell were all the parents in this movie. I know its a typical horror movie, and the parents need to be elsewhere for the teens to get into trouble. But every other adult was home. A woman unpacking her groceries, lots of people doing yard work, etc.

What I took away from this is if you are a teen/young adult, do not have sex. You will get an STD, maybe even a supernatural one.

There were a couple good parts; the musical score did its job by keeping me off balance a bit, and it did provide some tension. I also enjoyed the cinematography having a more 80s slasher movie vibe to it. But at points where the camera is scanning the scene 360 degrees looking for the creature, I had to close my eyes because it was making me queasy. But that may have been the objective, if so, well done.

Although it may not seem like it, I really do feel bad not having liked it. I was so excited to find a good horror movie, since they are rare lately. But alas, No. Just No.",1437264000,4,3663,4.1934566145092464

7086135,5,B00VAVNN5W,"We're living in a day where most viewers want either a ton of gore with their horror or for the film to be a constant barrage of jumps and scares. Most of our society has become so impatient, that anything that takes it's time; whether it be a book, a t.v. show or a film. So for those who want that type of film; IT FOLLOWS is not for you. IT FOLLOWS is a wonderfully sober homage to John Carpenter's iconic horror film HALLOWEEN. In it's long and sweeping shots, it's quaint home town feel, it's close knit group of friends and it's slow moving and hauntingly creepy villain. Following Jay as she first goes on a date and after having sex with her boyfriend finds herself being haunted and followed by a creepy presence that can look like anyone, and can be seen by no one other than those that are cursed. This brings some wonderfully tense and creepy ""chase"" sequences; and some beautiful cinematography. The sweeping long shots gives you a depth that is sore lacking in film these days. In this day of quick shots and shaky cam, this is a wonderful change. The film is slow moving, with plenty of talking sequences and moments of character development that are also lacking in today's horror. The acting is top notch by all, most particularly by Maika Monroe who plays Jay. But one of the most amazing things in this film however is the chilling 80's synth score by Disasterpiece. It's HALLOWEENesqe sound and it's simple yet haunting feel make it one of the best scores in a horror film in decades. The film is beautifully shot, and hauntingly creepy.

There wasn't any real sense of urgency or dread in this movie. Most of the time, the characters were just sitting around waiting for the thing to catch up. The movie had a great premise and a lot of potential, but it fell well short of that.  The most annoying thing, though, had to be the rediculous 70's soundtrack.  What a waste!",1437177600,11,594,4.5754716981132075
7086167,3,B00VAVNN5W,"Considering it holds a 90+, Certified Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and above average ratings on just about every single aggregate review website out there, you can't really fault people for coming into It Follows expecting anything short of a revitalization of the genre - a modern second-coming of Barker, Carpenter, and Hitchcock all rolled into one. Unfortunately, with such lofty expectations it's likely that the viewer will ultimately be let down.

On its surface, If Follows is about a relentless, unhurried, selectively-invisible entity that stalks a young girl, Jay, after a sexual encounter. The premise is a fairly original one, taking the old horror trope of ""You have sex, you die"" and somewhat turning it on its head. The production values are solid, the cinematography and soundtrack is top-notch, and the acting is par to slightly-above for low budget fair. It comes together as a fairly proficient slow-burn horror movie. Unfortunately, it probably burns a little too slow for its own good, and during its 100 minute run time not a whole lot actually happens. While the ""rules"" of the monster/curse are presented succinctly (actually, it happens more in an exposition-dump fashion, as if the movie is hurried to get somewhere more interesting), the movie spends zero time explaining the hows or whys behind it. Some may actually appreciate the ambiguity of it all, presenting the opportunity for interpretation, but considering the vacuum that is the film it seems like a missed opportunity.

Where the movie gets most of its legs is the discussions surrounding it. What does the monster represent? An STD? Death? Adulthood? What about water and pools? The commentary track on the BluRay is devoted to various critics stating their interpretations (which in and of itself seems to be a strange move, as if the filmmakers where trying to convince the general audience that there was indeed a deeper meaning).

Without those discussions, though, and the movie trying to stand on its own storytelling merits, it's just a somewhat underrealized concept.",1437177600,15,2069,5.170149253731343

So, if you want just a little intelligence in the movies you watch, you'll be very glad you left It Follows far behind.

Additionally: the 1980's-like soundtrack is annoying - the obvious work of an amateur.  Acting by supporting cast is very unrealistic, which distracts from the effort to get into what--in all respects--is just a poor quality movie.",1437091200,4,608,4.69811320754717

7086173,4,B00VAVNN5W,"Just finished watching this heavily hyped film, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a subtle horror film with a truly scary (and socially relevant) concept. The cinematography manipulates both the beauty and the squalor of the Detroit area shooting location to highlight the figurative ""shadows"" that polite society fears. This drives the story's point home well (if my interpretation of the film is sound). The score works; it's as decent as is the somewhat subdued acting.  I suppose to really make this one a ""classic"" for me I could've used just a bit more weirdness in the scary parts and maybe a bit more gore.

7086176,5,B00VAVNN5W,"This film which everyone is comparing with John Carpenter's Halloween is a welcome add to the growing number of anti coincidence oriented horror movies or as I'd like to call some of them 'oxymoronic horror' where the antagonist 'doesn't think but follow'(no being who follows is devoid of thinking). The film revolves around a group of school students who've gathered in an attempt to conquear what appears to me to be an imaginary enemy which they keep feeding with their fears, giving it ideas on whom to follow next. The film's cinematography is superb and one star reviews attempting to thwart off attention from it's artistry are bound to fail. The film itself is top notch artwork and does a good job showing the viewer what society is like where adults don't exist. The film's storyline can be divided in two for believers and skeptics of paranormal phenomena although the official version of the storyline says that 'it'is supposed to be real. We find it rather hard to believe as viewers when we're not being told precisely what it's about and have to guess our way through which helps making the film better and won't ruin the storyline, contrary to what the one star reviewers complain about. As the difference between reality and unreality starts to blur it becomes easier to decide whether the characters are having a supernatural experience - or are simply justifying vandalism by inventing a common enemy which coincidence theorists have become known for during the past decades. Watching the film in cinema was overall a truly wonderful experience although much more horror could have been expected. And consequently with the mainstream media's casting of coincidence theories in a sacred light it is not surprising that it's supposed unholiness can be approaxed as a form of unique, cinematic beauty. Nonetheless the film is not per ce about coincidence theories but rather about attempts to wonder what it's like to be viewed in a negative light by an outside person or entity one hardly knows anything about which helps add significantly up to it's atmospheric effects. I therefore give it five stars - because of brilliant acting, a top notch directing and an excessively good handling of the camera. Superb handling of camera, great acting and very good special effects plus a unique take on an apparently oxymonoric situation will indeed rank the film along John Carpenter's Halloween and related masterpieces. But perhaps one of it's most advantageous strong points is how 80's it feels like - more than most previous attempts I have seen at making a movie feel like it's taking place in the remote past.

I was anxious and paranoid for days, but I went online and read interpretations of the movie. Many people thought that ""it"" was really a STD. I felt like ""it"" was anxiety and fear.

When you are told that a movie is filled with symbolism you expect something that will leave you feeling as though the writers put a lot of thought into creating the movie.

What keeps this from being a classic: too many good ideas/images/characters either undeveloped or simply abandoned. Better casting would have helped.

7086197,5,B00VAVNN5W,"The horror genre has fallen on hard times over the past few years.  It Follows was such a breath of fresh air.  Think Halloween meets The Shining meets The Thing.  David Robert Mitchell has such a unique vision and so many scenes in this movie are a striking testament of that fact.  The main plot point, ""sex kills"", is also an interesting observation on our society, but it's never forced.  Nothing is forced for that matter.  It's all ambiguous which makes the film that much more haunting.

Also, the score by Disasterpiece is easily one of the best horror scores I've heard in decades.  It's psychedelic, haunting, quiet, and seducing.

It Follows is easily my favorite horror film to come along over the last decade, and David Robert Mitchell is definitely on my radar.  For the video review of this film, check out the link below at my review channel, Drumdums.

7086199,4,B00VAVNN5W,"Definitely a good movie, but I didn't like how it ended. I get what the deeper meaning behind the movie was supposed to be. The ""it"" was just a giant metaphor for death that can never be escaped. For a movie which is so heavy handed about telling us this though it never elaborates on the fact that if you spend your whole life running from death you won't have a life worth living. It also just absolutely makes no nod to self determination or hope. Personally, if I knew for certain that I was going to die in a few days or weeks in some gut wrenching, horrible, and painful way I would just take my own life in a calm and peaceful way.
I think a better ending would have been for them to find a way to deter it for longer periods of time or all together stop it. The idea that we're all going to die is really just a statement of the facts. It only sounds deep because it's a fact we don't constantly remind ourselves of and for good reason. Again, life worth living, etc... The really deep meaning of life is actually living, and by extension living forever, thus defeating the ""it"".

PLUS:
I was just incessantly thinking this throughout the whole movie. WHERE ARE THE PARENTS, POLICE, OR JUST ADULTS IN GENERAL????? I mean, there was a rape, a murder, a gunshot wound, several unexplained injuries leading to the ER, kids who apparently don't have class and can come and go as they please, and spend what looked like days away from home without anyone doing anything.

7086206,1,B00VAVNN5W,"I admit that I am one of those die-hard horror fans who will see absolutely anything that is released in this genre with the hope that I will see something I haven't seen a million times that will inspire goosebumps and horrific nightmares. But that's just me. And this movie (the hype anyway) had piqued my interest in the possilbility that it would come through as an original, well-orchestrated spinetingler. Such a disappointment. There is nothing original or remotely memorable about this film except for the terrible acting, non-existing script, bland, who-gives-a-crap characters and glaring lack of plot. The only decent scene is the very first which lasts a total of maybe 2 minutes. The rest is a snoozefest. The main character gets followed by slow moving people who aren't particularly menacing or remotely interesting in any way. And that's about it. She sees a slow moving person walking towards her and she runs. Then there is mindless conversation until she sees another person walking at her. She runs again and then there is more talk. Imagine this train of events over and over for an hour an half. And that is it, people. There is no explanation or insight at all into what is happening or why and there is zero resolution. I nodded off twice and had to rewind. One pool scene at the end is so absurd that I fast forwarded through it, kept going to see if anything else interesting happened and then found myself staring at credits rolling.

The horror genre is DEAD. Perhaps the ONLY thing this movie's got going for it is that it was not a 'found footage' yawner. I am so disgusted with the way the genre has been destroyed over the past decade by churning out uninspired, unimaginative drivel and then mass-marketing it as if it were a new classic in the making. What a joke. If the film execs spent their time and money on making a quality piece of film instead of on the PR it takes to fool people into thinking they're going to see something they've never seen before, maybe then we would get a new treatment for this lost genre.

7086212,4,B00VAVNN5W,"While watching It Follows, the one thought that kept popping in my head was A Nightmare on Elm Street.  Not that the villain in It Follows reminded me of Fred Krueger.  Or that the plot was similar in any coherent way.  But the feeling the movie gave me.  That on-the-edge-of-your-seat feeling that you're watching something special and that you're not quite sure what's real and what's not.  While Elm Street movies started making the line between dream and reality very specific, the first A Nightmare on Elm Street made the waking life and dreaming life feel incredibly similar.  It kept you on your feet and added a feeling of surreality to the story.

It Follows keeps that surreal feeling throughout.  Writer/Director David Mitchell creates a location that seems to be timeless.  And I mean that quite literally.  It's impossible to really nail down the time the movie is set...or if it's even truly set in our world.  On the outside, it looks like a typical American town.  But the small details offset this feeling.  One of the teens reads an e-book on a clam-shell e-reader.  But the teens watch old movies on an old-school CRT television.  The town itself has an 80s vibe to it, but there's aspects of it that feel out of place or vaguely futuristic.  It's also filmed in a kind of lackadaisical manner that adds to the dream-like quality.  Then, there's the score itself.  What a surprise it was.  It apes the techno musicality of 80s movies, but gives it a harsher edge.  As a lover of 80s horror and, in particular, A Nightmare on Elm Street, It Follows really struck a chord with me.

Other horror movies were obviously an inspiration for David Mitchell, as well.  The villain in the movie slowly and assuredly stalks the teenagers, moving like so many slow-footed monsters from 70s/80s horror.  The idea behind the film, that of sex passing on some unstoppable demon that you are then forced to pass on, is reminiscent of The Ring.  But Mitchell never rips-off these ideas.  He uses them to create a wholly original concept.  The idea that this demon or monster can take any form, but is slowly walking straight for you is creepy and intense.  It's used to great effect in a lot of scenes, where the camera will pan and the viewer is instantly looking to see if someone is walking toward the victims or if it's just a casual passerby.

It's an absolute gem of a horror film.  One I definitely recommend to any horror fan.",1436918400,,2436,4.639344262295082
7086213,4,B00VAVNN5W,"The first time I saw the movie I loved it because it truly is the best scary movie since the 80's. The soundtrack, the creepy following thing, the original concept and the way the atmosphere is set all make it a great movie.  This movie doesn't follow any typical scary movie formulas, which is refreshing.  (You know what I'm talking about.  The whole there is a supernatural presence so let's go to the library and figure the whole thing out formula) This movie left a lot unexplained which is good for the watcher to use their imaginations and come to their own conclusions.  I do however wish I knew who it all started with.  There are a lot of good things about the movie but I gave it a 4 out of 5 because watching it for the second time at home and not in the theater it wasn't as thrilling or shocking as the first time.  It was kind of mild and slow.  I wanted it to retain it's original creepiness and it didn't.",1436918400,,922,4.234285714285714
7086214,5,B00VAVNN5W,"The horror genre is the most popular genre of film, I know it is, ""how do I know this,"" you ask, because Kristin Stewart and Taylor Lautner told me so at the Oscars a few years ago! I've always suspected this, but a few teen heartthrobs say so on national television, on the biggest awards show in the world, it must be true! (wink, wink)

With that being said, like every genre it tends to get stale after so many sequels, so many ripoffs, and here lately, so many reboots! So, as if the horror movie gods are looking down on us, a movie seems to always come along just at the right time to shake things up. Like, Halloween in '79, A Nightmare on Elm Street in '84, Scream in '96, The Blair witch Project in '99 and now you can add to the list It Follows in '15!

The film's premise, like most classic horror films, is a simple one, a teenage girl unknowingly contracts a supernatural entity after a sexual encounter with a young man. This thing will follow her, as it did him, until she passes it along (through yet another sexual encounter.)

The entity can only be seen by the person infected, and can take the form of a complete stranger or the person's best friend, brother, sister etc.

The reason this film works is the director's simple, yet effective choices:

The Cast: The kids in this film look and feel like real teenagers that could actually leave in your very own town.
The performances are extremely natural with never a false moment that doesn't feel authentic. Standing out from the bunch, is protagonist Maika Monroe (Jay) she feels like an actual girl next door, not a 5'10 supermodel with huge boobs who we're suppose to believe is really the girl next door. Her acting is subtle yet strong, as you can see her eyes filled with terror with ""it"" begins to follow her. She reminds me of a younger, prettier Chloe Sevigny.

The Location: This film really feels like middle America, because it IS middle America being shot in Detroit, MI.

It's funny, while watching this film in the theater, I realized that the houses in the neighborhoods looked like houses in my neighborhood, which I have lived in the Mid-west my entire life. I thought Hollywood has done a decent enough job at portraying the Mid-West landscape on film before but after watching this film I realized they really haven't. This is what the Mid-West really looks like!

Widescreen: Although widescreen is probably used more, and seen more than ever before (flat screens, computers, tablets) directors rarely use it to it's full potential. This director does, as in many shot your always looking in the background wondering if that person walking close could be ""it!""

Potential Franchise: Lets not kid ourselves, the horror genre is the most sequelized genre in the history of cinema, there's no reason to think that this film won't spawn numerous sequels as well, as the director in Fangoria magazine has already confirmed his desire to explore ""it"" further, what this film though has the potential to do, that most horror sequels can't or won't do, is make an even better film second time around as the director has left so many unanswered questions from the first film like, What is ""it?"" Where does ""it"" come from? How do you stop ""it?"" There is so much ground laid forth for a potential sequel and sequels in the future.

The film is not without at least one flaw (at least in my opinion) the director sets up a cool retro\this couldn't take place in any time period sort of thing but completely shatters that by including a modern day cellphone in one scene and a futuristic looking seashell tablet thingie a characters uses throughout the movie. By doing this we know now that it could NOT be the eighties, or the seventies, or the nineties, it has to be some time in the modern era, as that technology didn't exist then, so he effectively completely throws all of the good work in the set design, costume design, cars etc. by including those darn cellphones! That really ""urked"" me, but I guess no movie is perfect, right?

With that being said I think this film has the potential to be a true classic in the genre, to be watched ten, twenty years from now with the same enthusiasm we watch A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Shinning, Rose Mary's Baby etc.

It is praised for being really scary but I did not find it scary at all to where I can't sleep at night, I found it scary due to the fact that I would not want to be in her situation and you really feel the anxiety the character feels throughout the whole movie.

This is the kind of movie that demands your attention and one that you really can't switch your mind off to. I really admired its unique approach of being ""haunted"" and how it favors true suspense over lame jump scares. The amazing soundtrack and the surreal setting also serve to give the movie this sort of 70's-80's nostalgic feel. The reason I say its not for everyone though is because the scares aren't really in the traditional sense. Don't come into this movie looking for in-your-face scares like in The Exorcist. ""It Follows"" is the kind of horror that slowly creeps up on you. Its the kind of horror where you know there is something horrible coming for you but there is nothing that you or anyone else can do to stop it.

The fact so much of the plot is invested with style, humor, and intelligence makes the gaps in plausibility feel even more like a lazy betrayal. Why can't the current victim board a plane and fly thousands of miles away from the entity that seems only capable of chasing it on foot? I have no problem with their being some unknowns, things that can't easily be answered by the young people at the center of this story. I admire their pluck and their willingness to band together to try and defeat some sort of primal evil that feeds on their sexual energy, but there are just too many flimsy patches of plotting to forgive. I find that I think about this film more often than most horror movies, but often because I wonder what it would have been like to see it stay at the high level of its best scenes and the talent of its game young cast.

7086271,5,B00VAVNN5W,"I've watched this movie about 3 times over, and appreciate it more every single time. It's very artfully done - not many jump scares, but it keeps you in a constant state of anxiety and dread over where the monster is and when it will show up next. On my first watching in the theater, I caught myself looking over my shoulder a few times as I walked back to my car. The movie, the dread, the anxiety, all lingers - or to put it another way, it follows - even after the screen turns off and you resume your daily activities. Here are just some of the reasons for my rave review:

1) The plot can be interpreted in so many different ways. I've seen a lot of theories, some of which are too simplistic or too complicated, but at least the movie gets you talking. Even the director has acknowledged that it could fit into any number of theories. My interpretation is that ""it"" is a metaphor for adulthood. I won't waste too much space here, but you can read this in any number of articles on that after watching the movie. I also recommend reading interviews with the director, David Robert Mitchell, that will shed some light on the different theories circulating.

2) The details are incredible. You won't pick up everything on the first watch, so this movie gets better with each re-watching. David Robert Mitchell was so deliberate with his choices if you just pay attention. It's very well done and like I said above, I appreciate it more every day.

3) The soundtrack - oh, the soundtrack. It sounds like a throwback to John Carpenter, and it makes me very happy. I think the best term to describe the music is ""unsettling."" You notice the music almost immediately, but it never detracts from the film. Its a perfect fit.

4) This might be a little technical, but the camerawork is great. Especially considering the low budget they were working with! Some very nice tracking shots, a couple 360 degree shots, and I won't spoil it but there's a scene at the end where I actually flinch. The technical work is impressive.

5) The Detroit suburbs was a great location choice. He never makes it seem like ""ruin porn"" but the scenery adds a lot to the overall feel of the moviel. I can't quite articulate it, but you'll notice when you watch the movie.

I could keep gushing about how much I adore this movie, but I'll spare you. Watch for yourself, you'll probably notice some things I missed or have your own ideas about what it all means. Rent/buy, enjoy, and see if you can avoid second-guessing when you watch people walk just a little too slowly straight in your direction down the sidewalk :)",1436400000,,2597,4.491525423728813

7086279,3,B00VAVNN5W,"Fun scary horror film focused on teenagers being followed by a mystery entity.  Is it a ghost, zombie, or being with mysterious powers?  The truly big scare is the thought of something slowly and relentlessly following you forever unless you have sex with someone who will then be followed.  So, basically, if you don't mind giving someone a death sentence, you'll be fine.  Best solution:  find a prostitute (male or female), have sex, and then the prostitute will have sex with someone else you don't know or travel overseas.

7086281,3,B00VAVNN5W,Im sure my fascination to watch this came from all the viral hype of this movie. I love horror/scary movies and this premise of this sounded intriguing. I think maybe this would have been a better book so we could at least get the inner dialog of what the characters were thinking. On screen it was just too much of the characters sitting or lying around not speaking waiting for something to happen. There really wasn't a lot of dialog throughout this movie. If you're going to have it be more showing than telling you need to at least show something.

7086283,5,B00VAVNN5W,"There's a reason why half the reviews give this movie 5 stars -- it rocks.

First of all, the trailer is outstanding, with a musical piece by Disasterpeace that rivals the soundtrack of ""Only God Forgives."" I'm a big sucker for a good soundtrack, and this film certainly does not disappoint.

The plot revolves around an interesting concept, namely some kind of STD with an odd side effect: being followed by ""it."" We don't really know what ""it"" is, but apparently it's like some kind of stalker assassin. The only way to save yourself is to pass on the burden, which sets a new target for the villain.

The mood of the film is perfectly established with dark tones shadowing the characters' actions, followed by only brief moments of serenity, usually during the daylight. This back and forth roller coaster of safety versus insanity creates a thrilling experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat. With a fantastic soundtrack as well, the film overall is a masterpiece. It was well worth the purchase and definitely a film I plan to watch again.",1436400000,,1058,4.708108108108108

7086285,2,B00VAVNN5W,"What a waste of time. There is a decent plot here, its just that they cram about 30 minutes of story into over a hour and a half. The production is joyless too. The actors remind me of the kind in M. Night Shaymalan (sp) movies, where they are always moping or serious and never show emotion. There are several parts where the actor just lay around while waiting for a monster to come and kill their friend! I think I would at least be a little nervous or something. They also NEVER explain what the heck is going on, what the thing is, or how it came about. It is a good premise that is entirely wasted.",1436313600,7,604,4.127118644067797

It's not at all in sync with ""it"" following you. And if the writer makes a choice like that its impossible for me to be scared because I'm sitting there wondering ""what are you doing?"" -- and couldn't help but wonder why that guy gave it to the girl he actually likes instead of some anonymous hooker.  Also ""It"" doesn't always understand the meaning of the word ""follow"" because an old man standing on the roof in his undies isn't really following you, nor is it scary.

I bought it on Amazon which was a couple bucks cheaper than Verizon. I don't feel like it was worth the $$.  Creepy yes, scary noooo... Worth watching but I wouldn't pay more that $5 had I known..

The premise, acting, and directing were all very good but in the end this film limbered along with a lot more style than substance.  In the end this movie was not enough to pull the genre out of the crapper it has gotten itself into the last couple of years but certainly a valiant effort worth a watch.",1435968000,2,605,4.198275862068965
7086297,5,B00VAVNN5W,"Like the best horror movies, ""It Follows"" has a little more going on than just a few jump scares. It wants to unsettle the viewer, and make a few interesting analogies along the way, all while paying homage to the oeuvre of John Carpenter. The story concerns 19 year old Jay, a college student living at home and dreaming of a more independent existence. She decides the time has come to sleep with her new boyfriend Hugh. Or at least, she has been led to believe that his name is Hugh. She'll come to find out his real name is Jeff, and that she should have shown him the curb. He passes on a curse to her that is propagated by sexual activity. I'll let Jeff explain the rules in the move, if you choose to watch it. Suffice it to say that, although the movie never comes right out and says so, the plot incorporates a lot of the succubus legend. Jay finds herself being followed (hence the title) relentlessly by an evil spirit that can look like anyone. Nobody else can see it, but it can effect the physical world just fine and dandy. A lot of the suspense in the movie is generated by wondering if an extra crossing across the back of the frame is going to suddenly make a beeline for our heroine. The director uses this to create dread very effectively with some great tracking shots. There is only one jump scare in here and it is very well earned and easily forgiven. Everything else is pure ""don't open that door"" freakiness. The soundtrack is genius, the setting is inspired, and any fan of ""Halloween"" will spot the references. The ending might be a 'love it or hate it' but personally I loved it. It is (minor spoiler) open ended but with a hopefulness about it. It strikes a balance you don't often see in modern horror, which lately likes to go as dark as possible when it's not an unambiguously happy ending. Give me ambiguously happy any day.

The music blends moody nostalgia with tense, chaotic noise in a way sometimes eerily similar to Akira Yamaoka's work on Silent Hill (the video game). The cinematography is also pretty incredible, creating constant unease no matter the circumstances onscreen. The idea behind the movie could have easily  been a bit silly, but it's executed in such a way that I was genuinely disturbed by the relentless and enigmatic ""sex demon"" thing. It's really the kind of movie that gets under your skin and stays there for a while. One scene in particular nearly had me jumping out of my chair in anxiety, the atmospheric buildup can be suddenly cranked up to full-on horror when you least expect it!

As much as I loved the movie, I was a tiny bit disappointed by the ending, though I appreciate what the director was trying to do with it. Overall the film was just incredibly refreshing and original, definitely my favorite horror movie of the year and worthy of a watch from anyone who even vaguely appreciates good horror.",1435795200,3,1147,4.817258883248731

I knew it wasn't going to be filled with blood and gore and I was glad of that, but I did expect more scares than I got! it was still a good movie, I think. I just don't feel like it was nearly as great and/or scary a film than it was so hyped up to be!
The acting was good, the ""darkness"" of the location and cinematography could both stand on their own, and I did like the fact that the director and writer took a different, unique approach to a subject that would not normally be seen as ""horror/thriller"" material.

Now a lot of critics have said this film can resemble a STD because you either pass it to another person or let it kill you or you just try your hardest and run away from it. It never stops walking wherever you are it is slowly headed towards you walking, now I personally feel that's insane wherever you are its always headed towards you that's creepy. Oh also the era that the movie is in is meant to feel like a dreamy era since the fashion can go from the 70's to new age same with technology and the cars.

In the wake of sleeping with a handsome stranger, Jay (Maika Monroe) quickly learns that she has inherited a most unusual curse: Wherever she goes, lumbering, half-naked phantoms follow, and their singular goal is to see her dead. Desperate, Jay turns to her younger sister and loyal circle of friends to for help. In time, however, Jay learns that her only hope for escaping death is to sleep with someone else, and pass the curse on. But the pursuing phantoms are invisible to Jay's friends and it soon becomes apparent that her time is running out. Now, with death closing in, the terrified young woman will be forced to make a difficult decision if she hopes to survive her terrifying ordeal.

The cast are a tour-de-force of acting ability including Maika Monroe as a sex-kitten teen desperate to grow into an adult, she manages to do this as her behest as a sex curse in put upon her, the story deals with her daily terror of being followed by an entity. This curse can be passed over by getting jiggy with someone, a metaphor of STD and aids in clever and layered textures throughout this movies 90 minutes. It Follows disguises itself as a now-possibly-family-friendly movie like Halloween but underneath is a demonic din or sexual abuse and disease. This movie works on so many levels and is a movie with encompasses aspects of my childhood innocence and teenage drama with a melancholic, frenzied score which means more than a standard horror.

It follows in the tradition of Hitchcock's *The Birds* (no explanation for why the monsters exist), Polanski's *Repulsion* (young woman seeing weird entity that no one else sees), and other classics of psychological horror.

IT FOLLOWS is an art-house horror classic.

What is an art house horror? Its a film that is done most tastefully without real emphasis on trying to spook you out. The score is the most unforgettable haunting score since maybe The Social Network. The video recording is larger than life, the film is placed beautifully in a time that's gone at least 2 decades back, the story is presented uniquely, you will not have many jumpy moments but there will be times where you will feel WOW this is so different.

7086328,5,B00VAVNN5W,"A young woman runs out of her house in a Detroit suburb in the middle of the day, bare legged and wearing black high heels, screaming.  The camera follows her and does a 180, showing us that there is nothing nearby, only a neighbor who asks if everything is okay.  Still screaming, she gets in her car and drives away as the soundtrack blares some truly discordant and predatory music at high volume.  We then learn what she was screaming about, but we have no answers.  And so the movie grabs your attention and does not let go.

It Follows is one of the best horror films ever made, period.  Since the mid nineteen-eighties, the vast majority of movies in the genre are more concerned with making you laugh or showing you how clever they are in re-configuring or poking fun at old tropes.  It Follows is not that kind of picture.

The movie plays it 100% straight.  It starts with the lead actress, Maika Monroe, who plays the main character as vulnerable and completely earnest. Her friends are like the average kids on your street, and they rally around her.  It is all completely understandable, as you will not want to see her get harmed, either.  The use of the camera, the score by Disasterpiece, and a mise-en-scene that deliberately never lets you in on exactly when the movie is supposed to take place give the entire affair a trance-inducing, dream-like quality.

That said, It Follows is not for everyone.  The premise cannot be explained without inducing eye-rolls.  There is very little actual gore, no real answers are forthcoming, and the nihilistic conclusion might leave you dissatisfied.  But if your idea of great horror is an atmospheric sense of dread and paranoia, you cannot do better than this film.",1432684800,104,1725,4.703333333333333

Honestly, this is one of the most unique and stunning horror films that I have seen for a long time. Director David Robert Mitchell was able to not only create a fantastic horror film, but have the film stand out. There is no explanation for this ""it"". You don't get a backstory to the film. In doing this, Mitchell is able to create characters that seem more realistic. Although they may not have backstories, they feel more relatable, since it feels like they are people, not fictional characters. What really struck me about this film is the score. I was blown away with the score. It felt like it belonged in a John Carpenter film. Some have said that this film is a copy, but you can tell that aspects of his films were inserted, but Mitchell added his own style to the film.

Some of the scenes here are like a dirty joke that people would laugh at on South Park getting the Stanley Kubrick Shining treatment. I don't think there's a better compliment than that. It's also pretty funny in between all the creepiness and even has a sense of character development. It's even got a sort of funny logic to the film where characters tend behave semi-intelligently until they get freaked out and act like horror movie characters. Basically, it works for it.

One thing the movie really rewards is careful attention the sets. There are multiple scenes of simply the surroundings being shown in sort of upgraded subtle version of Checkov's gun. It's level of craft and detail you don't normally get in horror movies.

Say a spirit from a scorned girl, or a boy who was killed to soon. Give me a reason to be scared of ""it"" for me without a real reason the movie was a bust. But that is from my perspective I can respect the reviews of others that say the movie was good and I can respect their reasons, but for a horror buff such as myself I couldn't be scared or jump because honestly ""it"" wasn't a scary enough reason to be. The actors were great, the idea was even good but for me it was just a flat movie with no real story line that made me really scared.",1431388800,8,681,3.906474820143885
7086335,5,B00VAVNN5W,"It Follows is one of those movies that relies on atmosphere to carry it...and, unlike numerous others, it succeeds in setting an eerie and unsettling atmosphere that reinforces the story. Between the musical score, the acceptably decent narrative, acting that successfully lends realism and plausibility to a pretty far fetched (though exceedingly uncomfortable) premise, and directing that capitalizes on all of those elements in such a way as to create a very memorable movie that sticks with you after the credits are rolling...this ended up being a movie that lived up to the interest it piqued in me from seeing the trailers.
Think of it as The Ring, but with sex as the method of transmission. The correlation with American adaptation of The Ring is appropriate in other ways as well, there is a similarly pervasive atmosphere and an artistic build up that fluctuates between subtle intervals and tense moments that make for a strong overall flow.
There is a part of me that thinks teachers should show this in sexual education classes just to make the whole idea of sex as uncomfortable as possible for children and adolescents...because making kids afraid of sex until they are old enough to rationalize that this is entirely fiction might be effective. Hit them when they are young enough and this movie could absolutely implant a bit of fear at the prospect of having sex. Of course I'm not being serious there, since fear of sex is probably about as counterproductive as abstinence-only education...potentially more so.
I'm sure there will be mixed feelings from people who watch this one, but personally I found it to be one of the best horror movies I've seen...I like this sort of movie quite a bit though, not that I have seen many along these lines.

7086337,2,B00VAVNN5W,"It Follows is a 2015 indie horror thriller that took critics/theaters by storm, a rare feat these days especially considering they didn't have an aggressive marketing campaign like Paranormal Activity or The Purge did. So knowing nothing other than it had a 95% on Rotten Tomatoes, I went into this for a good movie.

Which it was for the most part, It Follows is basically an urban legend fully realized into a psycho-sexual mysterious monster where the 'less is more' approach is utilized in an effectively creepy way. The camerawork too was very well done, encapsulating the paranoid mentality the main characters have regarding the threat. One aspect of the monster in the film that really worked for me was how it's appearance would change simply to wear down the victim's sanity. The film also does the horror genre much justice by dropping jump scares/unnecessary gore, and sticking with a constant creeping dread. Subtlety is also played up in this film, where the threat is hidden in the backdrop at parts, and the fact that the movie doesn't make this apparent is a nice change of a typical stupid horror movie. So why the low rating?

Well it didn't have an ending, the threat is briefly neutralized in the climactic scene, the main character decides that love is worth jeopardizing another lovesick character's life with, and they walk into the sunset with 'it' following them. Oh yes, and a minor character reads a quote about the terror of the inevitability of death. That's seriously how it ends. When the movie decides to go out on a vague note and makes a meta-reference to the reason why it's effective; isn't enough. In fact that stupid wink to the audience cheapened the value of the rest of the movie for me; instead of going somewhere with it's amazing set-up, it just stops and tells you ""it's a vague reference to something inevitable (maturity/responsibility/death), good enough? alright that'll be $10 plz"". The praise that It Swallows receives seems to be the cause/effect of a movie pandering to horror nerds and discrediting idiots like me who want some sort of conclusion to any of the investment (character/story/theme-wise) into this nearly two hour movie.

As others have noted, It Follows can be appreciated for taking a new step in horror and hopefully leading subsequent horror movies into the right direction where dread is more effective than quick gore, however it's lackadaisical non-ending discredits it's indie praise. It Follows was on the right track to be a very effective/original horror movie on multiple levels, but instead falls flat going for a metaphor instead of a conclusion to it's disturbed themes.",1431043200,10,2653,4.9707207207207205

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it for what it was and might have actually given it a higher rating had it not been so grossly overhyped.  I was expecting ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and all I got was ""Con Air"".  I'm a fan of new comer, Maika Monroe and I really think she's got a bright future ahead of her as a leading lady (especially following the hype from this film).  All the acting was great, in my opinion, but some things were just dull.  The soundtrack, for instance.....Many people claim it to be this superb achievement?  I didn't get that.  Some of it was good, but the cheap ""keyboard"" sounds they crammed over the dark tones lost it for me.  Sounded like they were attempting a ""Napoleon Dynamite"" simplicity, but it just didn't translate for me.  The ending is what completely threw me off.  Not the actual ""scene"" in which they attempted to rid themselves of the demon, but afterwards when it just stopped.  There really was no explanation and that didn't do it for me.  It was too abrupt.  But again, just my opinion.

Final Verdict:  Check it out.  It IS worth the rent!  Again, just don't buy into the hype.",1430870400,7,1468,4.488636363636363

Those are the two words that come to my mind when I think about ""It Follows,"" and that is before I even dig deep into the themes of the movie. This is no ordinary horror movie by any means, it is truly unique. In fact, it deserves praise for being unique in the horror industry, which is lacking a lot of originality.

In this movie, we follow Jay and the experiences she goes through throughout the movie. After an innocent sexual encounter with her boyfriend she learns there is this being, the titular ""It,"" and this being will chase after her until it either catches her or she gives the curse to someone else through sex. The catch 22 here is that even when she gets rid of it, she is not completely free. If the being kills the person she passed it onto then it will just come after Jay again and the whole chase will start until she finally runs out of steam.

When I first heard of the concept of the movie (sex literally kills) I became very intrigued. Sex is not an old concept in horror movies, in fact it has become a tired game at this point. As viewers we know what it means when people have sex in a horror movie (especially a slasher movie), ""they dead"" one audience member exclaimed during the viewing of a slasher movie and the funny thing is that person was right. Instead of people shrieking in horror at the monstrous villain, people just laughed and started exclaiming ""I knew it!"" Yes, we all knew it. But ""It Follows"" makes it much harder for us to go along that line of thinking.

It takes the concept of sex in horror movies and completely turns it on it's head. Here, sex is the cause the main characters problems and it makes everything ambiguous, no one knows how to deal with it. If this was a simple slasher film or haunted-house story then the answer would be simple, either kill the masked maniac and/or run away from the house. However, running is what the main characters do but all it does is prolong the inevitable. This being will follow Jay to ends of the Earth if it has to until she passes it along but that isn't the only thing that makes it terrifying.

This being also has the ability to change shapes into other people. As the trailers said, ""could be someone you know, or a stranger in crowd, whatever helps it get close to you."" This makes every frame of the film a terrifying experience, they could be next to a lake somewhere and the being is slowly gaining traction on them or they could be at a crowded mall and have no idea which (if any) of the people around them is the being finally catching up to Jay. By turning the everyday (peaceful neighborhoods, schools in the day, the people around them) into something potentially dangerous makes them all the more terrifying. It could be the kid walking your direction, your neighbor, parent, brother, sister, anyone really. This allows a constant amount of tension to build throughout the movie that holds you until the very end. Once again (like last years ""The Babadook""), we have a horror movie proving that the imagination is much scarier than what is reality. And not only is this an absolutely terrifying film, it is also an extremely intelligent one.

At first glance, one might think this film is a big metaphor about STD's and being safe. While the STD metaphor is very on the nose, it appears to be about so much more than that. Sex is not treated like some fun time to signal the audience this person is going to die like in other horror movies, in fact, the act of sex is treated with a great amount of respect by the filmmakers. In every sex scene in the movie, you find some sort of emotion going on through Jay. The first time she has sex with her boyfriend (before she learns about ""It"") she is happy and even nostalgic. There is a sense of intimacy between the two characters that feels genuine (at least for Jay) and the way she treats him after they finish shows this. Fast forward to other sex scenes, she is the exact opposite of this, instead of finding intimacy with someone, she finds guilt and fear of what's to come as well as what she's having to do to survive. If this was not enough to show how deep the theme of sex really goes, one character at some point asks her if she feels different after sex, does she change dramatically now that she's had sex?

Sex has a lot of ramifications, both mental and physical ones. To have sex one must be ready to take the next big step into adulthood, a step that most definitely ends childhood right then and there. In the beginning, Jay is like a child, free to spend her days daydreaming in her pool and watch movies with her friends all day during the summer. But this changes once she takes that step into adulthood, a step that changes everything. She speaks about how she used to dream of being old enough to do things like ride around in cars and go on dates, well now she can but she doesn't know where else this road leads to.

Of course, this is just an interpretation (one of the many I'm sure that have popped up) but it just shows how much time and thought was put into this film. People are debating the meaning the monster and what it represents all over the internet. If a movie can have people rage debating over the meaning of the monster (representing sexual awakening VS representing STD's) then that means the filmmakers have done something right. But I digress.

Maika Monroe steals the show as Jay, a young woman who is at times vulnerable yet bold, shy yet brimming with sexuality. She is a character you can find yourself rooting for and standing behind. Monroe portrays all the shades of Jay's character with the grace of a true actress. I can foresee a great future ahead of her as long as she keeps turning in performances such as this.

This movies is absolutely worth the time and money, it should not be missed. It is terrifying, wonderfully written, beautifully acted, and bracingly original and smart. Just like the titular being at the center of the movie, ""It Follows"" will stay with you long after the final credits roll onscreen.",1430784000,5,6060,4.441546762589928
7086340,4,B00VAVNN5W,"This movie has been getting a lot of praise as of late, and with the summer season vastly approaching here is my review for the movie It Follows.

It follows starts off in a rather disturbing manner, as a girl runs out of her house and later drives to a beach. A horrific scene later unfolds, and the scene shifts to a girl Jay who is on a movie date with Hugh. They play a game of ""pretend you are this person and I'll guess who you are"" while in line, and while in their seats, Hugh notices a certain woman. Strangely enough, Jay cannot see her and a worried Hugh suggests that they leave the theater.

From an acting standpoint, the actors/actresses do a fine job bringing It Follows to the big screen. Maika Monroe (who prior to this movie I have never heard of) does a nice job playing the main character Jay in It Follows. Whenever Jay is scared or sees something out of the norm, I felt scared right along with her. Keir Gilchrist and actor Jake Weary star as Paul and Hugh, while Olivia Luccardi and Daniel Zovatto portray Kelly and Greg, and all involved do a good job.

The story in It Follows offers an unusual, but provocative concept. It Follows is not going to entertain everyone, but I found the story to be different than most horror movies. It Follows did not necessarily make me feel entirely scared, but I did feel scared for the characters. There are times when a certain scene occurs, and I could imagine myself in a certain character's position, and whatever ""It"" may be, caused me to feel more anxious if anything. It Follows is one of those movies where there is an (""It"") out there that only a few people can see; which is why I consider the movie to be this sort of supernatural/thriller type movie. And even though the movie has a relatively short runtime, the thrills do not feel cheap or like (""haven't we seen this before in another horror movie?""). A VERY positive aspect I would like to point out too is the music. The music that plays in certain scenes has a creepy/unsettling vibe to it, which I definitely feel contributes to It Follows's theme and overall execution.

I was definitely intrigued(and still am in a way) by It Follows, and while there are certainly questions that I think (ahem) a sequel may answer, It Follows is a good movie due in part to the acting, the intrigue and suspense of the story, and the timely manner in which the movie was executed. It Follows is indeed

7086344,5,B00VAVNN5W,"I had not even seen a trailer for this movie, but decided to go see it with my fiance.  We were looking for a scary movie to see and he saw that it was playing and saw that Keir Gilchrist was in it so without even really knowing what it was about, we took a chance and saw it. I didn't expect much, but from the very first scene with the old school horror music playing in the background...I was immediately transfixed.

The last time I saw a movie that truly scared me and kept me up all night was back in 2002 when I was twelve years old and saw The Ring.  I was under the impression that there would never been another movie that came along and kept me from sleeping and even though I've seen hundreds of horror films without so much as a flinch...this one kept me up ALL night.  I probably fell asleep around 7 am and I have spent this weekend trying to  recover from it.

I'm a huge Stephen King fan and though most of his fans hate his short stories...I love them and that's exactly what this movie reminded me...one of King's short stories/novellas.

It's true what another viewer said...you will either love it or hate it, but if you're a true horror fan...I'm betting that you'll love it.

7086346,5,B00VAVNN5W,"I'm giving 'It Follows' 5 stars for two reasons: 1) I found it genuinely entertaining from start to finish. 2) The movie is totally original, and it's not easy to do an original horror movie that doesn't just feel like a gimmick. So, without giving away any plot spoilers, I will say there is a lot to like about this movie. For starters, it exists in its own time. The characters are totally modern but the setting is slightly surreal for reasons I won't share.  That's another reason why this gets 5 stars - it's not just a fun story - it's also artistically made. The movie LOOKS good, and the actors do a great job. Now - about the story - it's so unusual! The horror element has to do with getting an STD. This may sound 'wonky' but it totally works.  If you are really into horror movies, then you should know this is not a mega-bloodfest slasher flick. There is an eerie atmosphere that mostly maintains the tension throughout but it does occasionally lag, although I didn't mind that it wasn't about constant action. This is like the best of old school 70's & 80's European horror movies only with a 2015 American mentality. There are some scenes that are definitely inspired by Dario Argento films. If you do like this movie, I recommend you check out his films. The bottom line is that 'It Follows' might not be an Oscar winner, and it might not be for people who only like mainstream style action/slasher flicks, but if you are open minded and like a little innovation you will probably enjoy this.

This movie is similar to M R Jamess short story: Casting the Runes. There are a number of dramatic and frightening scenes, particularly the opening. Throughout much of the film the tension and terror is sustained and keeps you on the edge of your seat. However, there are times when the story lags, and the ending is a bit glib. Much of the action takes place in abandoned and derelict, former middle-class areas. This feature adds to the theme of social decay. The horror is driven by the necessity to have sex with another partner in order for the entity to shift its attention from that person being pursued onto the unwitting new sexual partner. A key theme of the film is how people are treated as objects and ends in themselves, where sexual encounters are used to emphasis the idea of victimization and callous disregard for the welfare of another person. When, Jamie, the protagonist is the latest victim in the chain, unlike those who predecease her, she is supported by friends. Jamie is torn between the moral choice of infecting or not infecting another person. Her attempts to escape her fate show that the source is anything but predictable. Sound effects and camera work emphasis the horror, but there are also some humorous moments. One of the movies strengths is that it appeals to a wider audience than simply horror fans. This is also a tale about young people growing into adulthood and discovering the awfulness of the world and the importance of looking out for each other.",1429142400,13,1514,4.782442748091603

7086351,5,B00VAVNN5W,"Amazing! Now THIS is a scary horror film. Very little gore and masterfully written. This film is both extremely unsettling and understated at the same time. I hate to say it, but I think the majority of those who gave this film a poor review just didn't get it. If you look at the nuances of this movie vs every other horror film known to the masses, there really has never been a film quite like this before. Ordinarily, horror movie ""rules"", especially ones that don't make much sense, make a movie benign and just kind of...stupid. This film had it's own slightly questionable ""rules"" ('it' can only walk, never run, you can't let it touch you or you'll die, etc, etc), but they managed to make the film more chilling and highly intriguing. If you are one of those kinds of people that needs clear reasoning behind every element of a film, you won't like it. It leaves a lot up to the imagination and it's up for interpretation that can differ depending on what aspect of the film you're looking at.
I'm clearly not an expert regarding film reviews, but I found this movie to be absolutely beautifully shot (and some of the creepiest camerawork I've ever seen in it's simplicity), extraordinarily well-acted, terrifying in a quieter, more dignified way than most other horror films, and unbelievably unsettling.",1428883200,7,1314,4.717391304347826
7086352,4,B00VAVNN5W,"George Orwell once said, All writers are vain, selfish and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives lies a mystery. Writing a book is a long, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand.  Ultimately this is what It Follows is all about.  And for the writer/director this film appears to be personal.

Much ballyhoo has been batted around about how the film is one of the scariest movies ever made and to some degree this is trueif you keep in mind this is not a horror story but rather a love story disguised as one.  Its this peculiar twist which what makes the film stands apart from the other horror garbage on the market.  One needs only to look at director/writer David Robert Mitchel to see that one of his male actors in the film looks almost exactly like he did when he was that age to put the pieces together as to what is going on here.  And you can be sure that somewhere out there is a brown eyed blonde girl who has a significant piece of this guys heart.  And apparently she ticked him off but good.

The story is set in Michigan where Mitchel grew up (are you with me so far) in a seemingly innocuous middleclass neighborhood which becomes a battleground for sex, virginity (for one of the characters) and a very vicious STD (though Im not entirely convinced thats what this monster is really supposed to be).  The story has three significant sex scenes: one which represents friendship, one which represents love and one which represents lust, but not necessarily in that order.  The first sex scene is the inciting incident, the second is the midpoint and the third is the climax (pun intended).

Sex is introduced as the culprit at the very top of the film where a scantily dressed young woman runs out into the middle of the street from something we cannot seeand she is wearing red stilettos.  Now normally the way she is dressed would be absurd.  But here it is a metaphorical clue for sex and the strange and chilling things to come (pun intended).  The girl eventually gets in her car and drives to a beach where she leaves a disturbing message for her father on her cell phone before something truly twisted happens.

Enter nineteen year old Jay, our pretty brown eyed blonde coed who has been dating a tall handsome blue eyed guy named Hugh whom she wants to seal the deal with.  The two go to a theatre on a date and there they play a game.  Each one has to secretly pick out a patron theyd like to be and each one has to figure out who the other picked.  Jay is wrong finding out that Hugh would not like to be the guy who is Mr. I Hit on Women like a Hammer but rather a young boy being helped by his parents at a drinking fountain (an important clue about water and virginity both of which the film comes back to later).  As they sit in the theatre Hugh also choses wrong when he says he thinks Jay would like to be the pretty girl in the yellow dress at the door.  But his wrong is very wrong because neither we the audience nor Jay can see this girl in the yellow dress.  Hugh becomes suddenly uncomfortable and they leave the theatre.  I might add that yellow is a color associated with deceit, betrayal, dishonesty, cowardice and illness which are pretty much on the money as you watch the next couple of pivotal scenes.

The film has a lasting quality after you watch it.  I was fortunate when I saw it to view it in a completely empty theatre except for myself which is often the best way to watch a film in my opinion.  I didn't find it creepy but rather penetrating (pun not intended) after viewing it.  It is a throwback film using dcor and props from the seventies and eighties when the heyday of teenage horror movies was in full swing which gives it a great look and a strange realistic quality despite its surrealistic storyline.

The dialogue at times could be punched up a bit, especially in some of the scenes that define the relationship and history between some of the characters. There are also some characters who could be better defined and fleshed out. Also the director hasn't quite honed his ability to bring out the necessary nuances and striking visuals in certain scenes he needed to take it from a very good film to a great one.  The biggest example of his inexperience is in how the three sex scenes are meant to differentiate friendship, love and lust they but all look the same, are shot with too much similarity, and come off as a wash.  It should be imminently clear to the audience how they differ and what they represent in the story since they play an even bigger part in the film in a sense then the actual tension and terror itself.

That said, however, the film is quite good, unique and haunting and even if you do not like horror films as a general rule, I would encourage you to watch this one.  It is not an overly bloody story.  Its tension is based on dread and the unknown.  And pay close attention to the blood which you will see towards the end of the story.  Perhaps it will look like blood to you.  But I couldn't help but see its uncanny similarity to ink.",1428796800,24,5179,4.364963503649635
7086353,5,B00VAVNN5W,"It Follows is an effective stripped down teen-horror movie. Writer-director David Mitchell admits the basic scary idea of It Follows comes from a recurring dream he experienced as a child-the not uncommon terror of beingpursued by something slow but relentless. We get a prelude,the gruesome death of a previous victim who motors to a shore, we see the gruesome consequences. Jay(Maika Monroe) after sex with boyfriend Hugh(who tells her he's passed on a curse through sex) she is pursued by all manner of mute,relentless pursuers,who take many forms of people,girls, boys, women,men,it even takes the forms of people known to the victim. The follower is invisible to all except those who have been cursed. The subtext to all this is teenage sexuality and STDs and the casual nature of their sex. Jay has to follow suit to rid herself of the curse,that is have sex. She does this with her ex Greg and witnesses the shape-shifting between Greg's outer form breaking in to his house then Greg being killed by the form of his mother.

Of course it all begins again for Jay as once the person you passed it onto is dead the curse returns to the originator. Jay is surrounded by friends and relatives sympathetic to her plight,who try and do what they can to keep the offending pursuer away, sometimes with risk to themselves. Jay has people who'll sleep with her opportunistically. The friends seem to have a lot of time doing this:sleeping at her place or driving around with her. Paul who has a crush on her passes it on to a prostitute. Set in the post-industrial depopulated suburbs of Detroit .This is a strange adult-free world with no mobile phones and analogue TVs. No sense of what time it's set in. What is electric is the widescreen frame which looks out into the day or night where we scan for the slightest movement,nature is alive in terms of trees and plants. Disasterpeace provides insistent synth sounds tearing at the nerves. The slow-walking spirits seem to come out of nature,a bit like more subtle zombies. I liked it but found it curiously empty as Mitchell explores the logic of his own invented mythology. Only love and sex ward off mortality: sex is danger but also liberation from danger.",1428710400,5,2210,4.785340314136126
7086354,1,B00VAVNN5W,"Director David Robert Mitchell has been wowing the Illiterati with his new, supposedly fresh take on the zombie/ghoul genre, but for my money, the picture is simply another time killer, not worthy of the praise that it is currently being given. While the idea of seeing naked people isn't particularly frightening to me (well, okay, some I would most definitely NOT wish to see nude), the director of this film seems to think that naked people walking is the most chilling thing on planet Earth. But, what truly irks me about this story is the lack thereof--there is no narrative, no context, no mythology, no history, and ultimately no point. I hate to sound like the old fuddy duddy complaining about these youngins, but how can it be fun to watch a movie that is bled of any ideas? Even in print, John Carpenter has explained that his plotting behind the original ""Halloween"" (the main influence upon this film according to Mitchell himself) did NOT involve any ideas about teens who are having premarital sex being followed up by vengeful deaths as retribution. But Mitchell, since he is not telling a story here of any kind, is ultimately unable to avoid pushing that point down our horror hungry throats. And, sadly enough, if you are a tried and true horror fiction fan, you will understand instantly that ""It Follows"" is anything other than scary--unless, of course, you are a prepubescent young girl afraid of boring jump scares. No, I'm very sorry, but I don't think original film is going to survive by way of pictures like this one--in order for the horror genre to progress, we are going to need more stories, not more carp about how unoriginal that all the other ones are. While the cinematography of Mike Gioulakis is interesting initially, it becomes apparent soon enough that ""It Follows"" is intellectually bankrupt in its critiquing of other horror movies. And to add insult to injury, there is no ending! We are just supposed to rise from our seats and leave, believing that this damn ""curse"" just keeps going and going and going....Well, this one was made by tweens for teens, and if you aren't in that crowd, I'd suggest sticking with tried and true classics, such as ""The Mummy"" (1932), ""I Spit on Your Grave"" (1978), ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" (1974), and ""Jacob's Ladder""--there is something in each of those films to chill you to the bone. The only thing I did after ""It Follows"" was laugh a bit while leaving the theater, wondering aloud to myself why I talked myself into believing that it would be good. But the truth remains, the movies are dry of imagination and risks. Exhibit A, folks. Exhibit A. F+
P.S. Photographer Gregory Crewdson may be able to follow a lawsuit in accordance with Mitchell's blatant plagiarism of some of his photographs.

7086359,5,B00VAVNN5W,"Many horror films become classics because they transform the mundane into something terrifying. Ringing phones, camping in the woods, bathroom mirrors  any of these banalities could be the harbinger of a gruesome death. Into that fine tradition comes this film which  successfully creates numerous nerve-wracking experiences from someone slowly walking.

On one hand its easy to go wild on the loaded premise to infer a variety of pointed ideas and grand-standing moralizing about young sex. So there is a decent academic backbone and intelligence to the feature as well. But besides being well-shot, nicely acted and coolly scored, the film is simply scary like few others ever are. Long moments of unsettling dread, creepy visuals, shocking apparitions - the movie nails its most important priority of being frighteningly tense. Unlike other pat horror films where the same rhythms of rest and attack are easily defined and observed, this film does a great job of imbuing even the dullest moments with a sense of danger. Nowhere is safe from this monster, as even the brightest and busiest places cannot offer shelter from its unrelenting attack.

A jaded viewer might gripe about some of the its logical fallacies and ambiguities, the subpar climax, and its low-budget effects. In fact, theres ample room for a few more inspired moments which the filmmakers unfortunately overlooked, since the movie does feel like it could have easily been more than the final results. Yet while those weaknesses aren't ideal, they barely detract from the overall experience of surviving this hellish ordeal. This movies freshly invented abomination shares some characteristics of a ghost or zombie, yet is so much more in its elegant design.

This movie is not 5-stars like a ""2001"" or ""Raging Bull"" is, but for its unsettling experience in the genre, it is definitely a modern masterpiece, sure to influence the direction of horror to come in the next generation.",1428278400,196,1952,5.1645569620253164
7086360,5,B00VAVNN5W,"Remember the first time you saw Michael Myers spying on Jamie Lee Curtis when she was walking home from school, in the original Halloween? The simplicity of that scene; from the soundtrack to the non-use of gore, was terrifying. He was just standing there, watching her. You knew what was going to happen later, and that scene allowed your mind to run away with the possibilities of terror that would ensue. As I watched ""It Follows"", that's exactly how I felt for the majority of the film. Terrifying simplicity, with a soundtrack/score that is OUT OF THIS WORLD Excellent. I actually believe that the music during this movie contributed more than anything else. So good I've pre-ordered it on vinyl. The cast is fresh and talented, and you won't recognize the villain until it is almost too late. See it, now.",1428278400,,811,4.75886524822695
7086361,4,B00VAVNN5W,"The horror genre isn't usually my cup of tea. The films are either dumb slasher nonsense, buried under long-established clichs, or a shallow collection of stupid jump scares. Dull, cheap and forgettable.

It Follows however, isn't your usual low-budget cash grab, here today gone tomorrow type of production. Its got something to say, and writer/director David Robert Mitchell delivers a gloriously simple, yet effective and stylish horror yarn.

Playing to a fantastic score thats an over the top mix of 80s synth pop, classic horror and modern-day ambient, Follows is a brooding euphemism for sexually transmitted diseases. A cautionary tale for its target teen audience, and grand advertisement for the abstinence-only program! Asking kids to wait before acting on their hormone fueled carnal desires, because the boogeyman might get them! Or a baby might arrive, and follow them around for the next twenty years  arguably a real life outcome just as scary as anything depicted in this film!

Shot simply and smoothly, the movie throws in a few jump scares, but mainly gets its jollies by establishing a palpable sense of dread, which it manages to effectively maintain throughout the film. Not giving the audience a moment to relax, as the story delivers its juicy premise, sets up the rules, and shows us how our group of atypical movie teens react to it.

It's not jump-scary per say, but rather a slow, terrifying type of scary that keeps you tense the whole time. The atmosphere will immerse you. Top notch cinematography (many of the shots look absolutely amazing) and not to mention the OST is incredible  reminds me of an 80's classic horror film.

Jamie (Maika Monroe) also called Jay which sounded like Kay is a young hot blond. She has sex with Hugh (Jake Weary) also called Jeff and inherits ""it."" ""It"" we find out is a doppelganger shape shifter that only the ""owner"" (or previous owners) can see. If it catches her, it will kill her. In order to get rid of ""it"" our hot blond has to sleep with someone else. There is the dweeb next door (Charles Gertner) she grew up with and the hunk older guy (Daniel Zovatto).

That's about it. Young hot blond needing to have sex to live in some adolescent version of ""tag.""

The plot was different for a horror film, except there really wasn't much horror. I couldn't ""feel"" it. I had a tune in my head: Depeche Mode ""Personal Jesus"" except it was ""Your own personal doppelganger..."" I thought the film could have used a better sound track, better acting and directing.

7086364,5,B00VAVNN5W,"I just want to get this out of the way, I have never been more excited for a single movie in my entire life! My expectations were through the roof, I of course had read to praise from critics all over the world saying 'It Follows is one of the best horror movies of the decade'. Which of course is very high praise (the same was said about last year's The Babadook, which I found to be true, it was also one of my favorite movies of the year), but does this year's It Follows live up to the title of being labeled one of the best horror movies of the millennium? Yes, no question about it! It Follows is the embodiment of tension and anxiety that we so rarely see in movies these days. Mitchell has created a perfect atmosphere full of dread, but more importantly he is able to create a nightmare with a dreamlike quality. The camera work is what helps make this idea flourish, wide angled shots mixed with slow panning shots revealing the monster lurking in the background. It Follows gets points for being terrifyingly original and creating a new nightmare where at all times you are never truly safe.

And of course enough cannot be said about the general idea of sex and what it stands for. In the movie sex is used as the tool to pass to curse from one person to another. Obviously symbolizing that sex can kill (literally), but at the same time having sex is also seen as liberating (you free yourself by passing it onto another person). This is what makes It Follows so interesting, interrupting what the monster itself represents and witnessing how different people handle said curse. The females in the film handle the situation completely different from their male counterparts. The males try to pass the curse off as fast as possible and with little remorse, whereas the females seem to feel more guilty about passing it along and struggle with their new found nightmare.

Without rambling on about the subtextual layer of the movie, just know that the movie is just as creepy as it sounds. Outside of that, the high point of the film has to be the original score by Disasterpeace, it's one of the best horror soundtracks in decades (and now a personal favorite)! The music is what makes this movie tick, it plays over the vast majority of the film and it is played extremely loud to help squeeze out every ounce of tension possible from each scene. With a killer soundtrack, fantastic cinematography, and a terrifying premise, It Follows is easily worthy of being labeled a future horror classic!

Bottom Line - This is one of the best horror movies of the past few decades!!",1428192000,3,2587,4.547210300429184
7086365,5,B00VAVNN5W,"1. Don't let the basic plot of the movie fool you: this movie is a surprisingly effective piece of low budget, slow-burn horror.

2. It's about a girl that sleeps with a guy, and is then stalked by a mysterious entity that wants to kill her. Yeah, it sounds absurd, and maybe it is, but just go with it.

3. The movie isn't really about the surface plot. It is an ode to childhood innocence, as well as an assault on childhood innocence.

4. There are a few inventive and effective jump scares, and the movie continually cranks up the paranoia and dread. Very few movies have given me as much anxiety as this one.

5. It's hard to set the film in an exact time and space - it's full of anachronistic details. Like, there are modern things like cell phones in the movie, but nobody ever seems to watch anything modern on TV. The clothes worn by the characters are a mishmash of styles and decades. Combine all that with a strangely beautiful synth soundtrack, and the events occur in a very dream-like atmosphere.

6. There are tantalizing cultural and psychological tidbits riddled throughout the movie like machine gun holes. The most obvious is the character who keeps pulling out her e-book reader disguised as a pink makeup holder, from which she reads aloud Dostoyevsky's bleak classic, ""The Idiot"".

7. This is the second film by director David Robert Mitchell. I don't think he had enough money to make all the effects look like they were supposed to, but he is earning a well-deserved reputation as a visual stylist.

8. Some people think the movie is literally about a demon. Others think it's a metaphor for the dangers of sex or intimacy. I don't think those interpretations are wrong, but they are really superficial. People with those interpretations missed most of the film. The real horror is not from the relentlessly stalking killer. Nor is it from symbolized, interpersonal trust issues. The real horror of the film is existential.

9. After the movie ended, I left the theater and started back to my car. And walking down the sidewalk, in public, the final piece of the movie's puzzle swung into place for me. I understood it on a deep level (perhaps deeper than Mitchell intended) and I just wanted to go home and curl up into a ball.",1427932800,22,2254,4.6175
7086366,5,B00VAVNN5W,"in it follows, maika monroe continues to prove herself a capable scream queen, and a particularly sympathetic final girl. fresh off the guest, which is super awesome, monroe plays jay, a young women who has sex and then has to deal with the inexorable and meditative approach of a murderous entity passed to her by her partner, and seen only by her. this clever device definitely stirs a sixth sense vibe, as the approaching energy takes the form of disturbingly unpleasant victims, or even loved ones. all jay knows is its making a beeline for her. in addition to the obvious metaphors for aids and stds, it follows is filled with loving and intelligent nods to other horror films, as well as its theme recalling reagan-era horror flicks that drove the mantra sex will kill you directly into our skulls

fortunately, jay is not alone, and this gives it follows perhaps my most favorite element, its sense of family. jay is surrounded by other teenagers, who display fierce loyalty to her and each other, and who accept with relative ease whats happening to jay. they're sort of like a low-key scooby gang, offering thoughtful assistance, while sitting around watching fifties poverty row science fiction on their rabbit-eared teevee or quoting purposefully from the idiot. no parents or adults are to be seen. its like peanuts.

it follows builds tension effectively, giving the story time to unfold. i liked the fact that it didn't bother with the usual information-gathering trope of newspaper articles about unexplained deaths. instead, we get an intimate look into the life of someone trying to survive something unknown. was i scared? not particularly, but i was definitely creeped-out and tense, more than good enough.

this movie is put together so wonderfully; director david robert mitchel and cinematographer mike gioulakis have a good sense of how to build dread visually, and the movie has a nice escalating feel. the incredible 360 pan shots are beautiful, and more than a few scenes recall dean cundeys stellar work in halloween. the lens is so wide and so smooth, i felt like i was along for the ride. additionally, the autumn colors and often muted sky grays, give the movie a vibrant seasonal quality. we see a lot of detroit and rural michigan, in both their beauty and decay. it all adds to the glorious vibe of this flick.

finally, the music. the music is sublime, truly. it sounds like if john carpenter and goblin got together and decided to re-interpret the music for night of the living dead. i love smart synth music, and disasterpeace has put together a creepy, ethereal soundtrack that manages to be both a throwback and modern at the same time. the music helps set the tone beautifully, and it also gives this movie a slightly off-kilter feeling, one that helps set it follows apart from other movies; it follows is pleasantly weird and displays a strong point of view. bravo.

it follows is a wonderful horror movie and proof that the genre is as vibrant and unique as it ever was.",1427932800,5,3012,4.829457364341085
7086367,5,B00VAVNN5W,"This movie is so terrifying! The acting, the atmosphere, the music, and the antagonist(s) made this movie a classic. There's a feeling of dread throughout the movie that never lets up. There's never a ""phew! they're safe"" moment so be prepared to be on edge the entire movie.",1427932800,2,275,4.75
7086368,4,B00VAVNN5W,"Entrancing and unsettling, this gritty timeless film serves as a powerful cautionary metaphor to the consequences of unprotected sex.  Beautifully executed and a unique experience; quite an unusual combination in the horror genre.

This film felt like so many familiar things, yet like nothing else.  The presence of a Kindle (or something sort of like that) indicates that the story takes place nowor close to present day.  Yet the use of corded phones and minimal presence of cell phones creates a sense of media isolation, much like pre-2000 horror, and the overall feeling reminds me more of an 80s horror setting.  Adding to this isolated 80s sensation, the entire film is scored with synthesizers.  This scoring is of much higher quality than an 80s film, and the style sets an ominous tone that readily resets our uneasiness as we watch.

And what is it were watching for?  After an intimate encounter, a young girl (Maika Monroe; The Guest) is told by her newly ex-boyfriend that something will follow her from now on; that this something once followed him but he has now given it to her.  This something has no specific form or identity and may appear as anyone, from a random unknown person to someone you love.  The only certainty is that, where ever you are, it will be somewhere walking directly towards youuntil it takes you, or you give it to someone else.  It becomes a palpable nightmare.

And that brings us to the most important thing of all:  this movie is scary?  You may not leap out of your seat or scream, but you will be scared.  This film propagates more of a continuous, quiet sense of dread.  As with White Noise, Shadow People and Paranormal Activity we find our eyes locked on the screen, looking for the it that follows.  Suddenly every person in the background becomes a candidate and every time a door opens we wonder if it will pass the threshold.  Typically we watch a screen and may jump at the appearance of a killer before his victim.  Here, we watch more in the same manner as the victim.  I really felt like I was in the movie for many of the scenes.

There was one scene towards the end that I didn't like.  It was a long and major scene, but still just the one turned me off.  Youll know it when you get to the indoor pool scene.  It felt like it belonged in a different movie of lower caliber.

Director/writer David Robert Mitchell is brand new to the business, but I expect hell become a household name to horror fans.  As far as I can tell, It Follows serves as something of a cautionary metaphor representing the risks of unsafe or premarital sex and being followed by the consequences, even the sense of dread that may haunt one while waiting to receive the results of an HIV test.  This metaphor, however, really pushes the envelope and the realness and likability of the young cast veils this nightmare with urgency.  There is one particularly intense scene in which it takes the form of a teen victims mother, and the way it takes you when it finds you is quite a disturbing image that was burned into my mind.  This film was unsettling and gritty, for sureand it does it without a menacing killer with a name and a scary past.  It does it with a nameless, protean entity; an unnerving breath of fresh air.

Even my horror-desensitized mind was on edge as I watched this masterfully crafted horror.  This truly unique and beautifully executed film pleased me overall.  It felt like a classic horror from the late 70s or early 80s with a modern production treatment.

Ignore the sexual theme, understand that there is nothing raunchy or gratuitous to be seen, and enjoy sense of unmatched isolated dread of It Follows.",1427846400,3,3668,4.600924499229584

8709734,5,B00VAVNN5W,"I wish there were more horror movies like this. It's a mesmerizing slow-burn with a heavy atmosphere that is equal parts dread and nostalgia (to me it was very evocative of the lazy, hazy, aimless days of summer vacations as a teenager). It's also got some very striking, dream-like imagery: I remember in particular a strangely menacing naked figure standing on the roof of a house, and a sequence in which the camera pans across a crowd of strangers, all passing across the field of view, going their own ways -- except for one figure in the distance, walking steadily straight toward you.

I also appreciate that, in the end, it turns out that this movie has not been just an exercise in dread, but has something to say about the human condition. Not to give too much away, but eventually the characters realize that the only way to take the edge off of our inevitable mortality is to commit to loving each other and facing it together.",1534204800,,939,4.589285714285714
