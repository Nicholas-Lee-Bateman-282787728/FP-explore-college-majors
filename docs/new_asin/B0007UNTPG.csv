8051830,5,B0007UNTPG,This is the definition of a genre film if ever there was one. It's a story of a gambler out west who gets into trouble and has to end up shooting his way out of it. In that sense it's a truely classic picture and perhaps the one that defined the genre. Think The Sting if it was set in the wild west and you have a pretty good idea of what this film is about. The restoration work on the film is well done adn it looks like it could have been filmed yesterday.,1147910400,2,460,3.8526315789473684
