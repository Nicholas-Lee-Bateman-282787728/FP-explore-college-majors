3786109,4,B001SNXHNK,"While there's some Small Faces and Humble Pie video circulating, this is about the best complete live performance of the late great Steve Marriott that I've seen. Songs from both bands are represented in this set (""All Or Nothing"", ""Tin Soldier"", ""30 Days In The Hole"", ""I Don't Need No Doctor"") which presents Marriott in a power trio format. It's an exciting and bluesy set, with (for a change) good camerawork which captures Marriott's guitar playing. My main quibble is the audio - Marriott was getting a good guitar tone, however, his instrument is buried in the mix. The drums and bass sound OK, however. Marriott does drop a couple of bad words into his patter, so be aware if watching with the kids. Other than that, I'd only wish the show was longer!",1247270400,10,759,4.6716417910447765

Marriott what an amazing talent one of the best voices that Britain ever produced  .... pretty good on the guitar too.",1374710400,,179,4.424242424242424
8340032,5,B001SNXHNK,"I am a Big Fan of Steve Marriott, Humble Pie and Small Faces. I have the dvd of Small Faces also and I love it. This dvd is great. Steve Marriott fans will love it. Steve is sadly missed and is one of the BEST blues singer and guitar player there will ever be. R.I.P my friend.",1349481600,,277,3.8771929824561404
8340033,5,B001SNXHNK,Any Humble pie fan would like this DVD after all Steve was the main voice. I had tryed to find a DVD of Humble Pie Live but there was none so I bought Steve Marriott All or Nothing Live in London and I have no regrets in doing so.,1325462400,2,230,3.7142857142857144
8340034,5,B001SNXHNK,"The band is in fine form on this night! I'm glad that this performance is out for the true fans to crank up and watch. Steve and Co. rock on this performance for sure,nothing to complain about here thats for sure. I hope a few more will trust this review and pick it up! I have always been a fan of Humble Pie and other projects that Steve was involved in over his career. There is no one like him thats for sure, and this dvd proves that just fine. Enjoy",1293062400,,455,4.010989010989011

8340036,5,B001SNXHNK,"Great DVD good quality, good show, I was a fan of Humble Pie back in the day, saw them once, I was just a lad then, but it left a lasting impression, it does seem a bit dated to me now, I would have preferred a Humble Pie DVD no doubt, but good to see this guy performing and nice interview too!",1262390400,,295,3.774193548387097
8340037,4,B001SNXHNK,"This is a very enjoyable Packet of Three show but is just a repackaging of the DVD titled LIVE IN LONDON.

Much like the audio/CD format, there are multiple versions of the same performance with different titles and artwork. At least this version has a photo of Steve that corresponds to the correct era. So check your racks, and if you don't own the show, by all means grab it. But if you already own LIVE IN LONDON, skip it.

8340038,5,B001SNXHNK,"A ""MUST HAVE"" for any Steve Marriott or Small Faces & Humble Pie fans. This 3 piece band called ""Packet of Three"" has a nice full sound considering it was filmed almost 25 years ago",1252281600,4,181,4.2
