476429,5,6302481791,"Those critics were deffinently wrong. The scenery was beautiful and the plot was really good. Tom Burlinson returns as young Jim Craig who is still in the middle of a war between the more rugged mountain men and the city  slickers in the valley below, and he's still trying to convince his former  boss to give up his daughters hand in marriage. I was dissapointed to see  Kirk Douglas hadnt returned though and even more dissaponted at what  happened to Denny, the faithful buckskin stock horse gelding. I wish my  stud acted the same way as the black Brunby stallion. I don't know if I  would have left that Aniston Patton off that easy.",959990400,,639,4.56140350877193
476430,5,6302481791,"This movie is one of my favorites! i am extremely glad they made a sequel to the first film, ""Man From Snowy River"". The first film leaves you hanging on the romance of Jessica and Jim. The sequel has many twist  and turns in the way of that romance. It's a heart-wrenching movie that  will make you cry. It's suspensful and the riding is phenominal! I loved it  and would recomend it to anyone!",948067200,,395,4.3108108108108105

I judge a movie by the  emotions I feel when I watch it and this one has them all.  When Jim  rescues Jessica from the cliff *sigh* I wish it could have been me...Great  scenery and a great story!  Highly Recommended!",917308800,,394,4.173333333333333

The movie suffers a little in the fact that Kirk Douglas didn't reprise his dual roles from the original, but Brian Dennehy does a fine job in filling one of those roles.  There is a slight storyline change from the original (I won't spoil the story) but it is kind of minor.  The film is full of beautifully filmed vistas and action.",1489449600,4,500,4.4021739130434785

Her father wants Jessica to marry well-to-do Alistair Patton, the son of a wealthy landowner. Craig shows up and best Patton in a feat of horsemanship. (naturally this is going to be about horses and love.) The landowners are trying to buy out all of the mountain men's claims, and there is a bit of a fued going on between them.

This is a first-class production, well polished, plenty of action, emotional turbulence, and yes, there seeems to be a morale to the story in the struggle between the underdog and the oppressive rich paople. This is still a movie that focuses on two things: true love and horseriding action. The actors are convincing in their role. I missed that Spur was dead, and Kirk Douglas didn't play Harrison in this version, but all-in-all, This met or exceeded the benchmark of the prequel.",1425254400,,1063,4.56544502617801

Some time later I was able to see it from the very beginning, and I decided to record it in case I wanted to view at a later date.  I enjoyed it so much, I purchased the movie in order to watch it on our big screen, which proved to be a good decision since there were so many beautiful and scenic views shown during the movie.  When I became aware of ""Return to Snowy River,"" there was no hesitation and I immediately ordered the movie from Amazon, and added it  to my collection.  I was somewhat disappointed not seeing Kirk Douglas in this second movie, however Brian Dennehy did an excellent job maintaining the character from
the first movie.  Again, the second movie had many beautiful scenes of the Australian continent and of the activities involving all the different horses.  I sincerely enjoyed the storyline of this two wonderful movies.",1393804800,,995,4.4944444444444445

478325,5,6302481791,"As I write this review, this wonderful movie is playing on my television.  Twenty five years ago, I stood in line at midnight waiting for the first viewing of this film and unlike other sequels, was not disappointed!  Not all sequels can live up to the original but I fell in love with this movie as I did it's predecessor.  It's a movie that I watch regularly.  The soundscore, the cinematography and even the continuation of the story of Jim and Jessica was believable and engaging.  Even deeper than that, the development of these two characters continues as well.  Jim though still strong and forthright, continues to learn the value of fighting for what is right, even when it requires a heavy price.  Jessica, though still full of stubbornness and spunk, is faced with choosing between to men that she loves.  She learns the value of being respected for what you are and not who you are!  Again, a worthy continuation!

My only negatives about this film has more to do with it's final editing and DVD production.  With editing it's more with the scenes they chose to delete in the American version of the film.  To be precise, the exclusion of the wedding scene.  Imagine my disappointment when a dear Australian friend told me that their version included this scene and most likely a few others.  Thankfully, I found it posted on YouTube (I don't think it's still there though).  My second negative is that Disney chose to only release the DVD in full screen mode.  The cinematography in this movie is breathtaking and to have to view it in ""full screen"" mode is a great injustice to the brilliance of the filming.

Still all in all, I can not recommend this movie enough.  If you haven't seen it, be sure that you watch the first one, Man from Snowy River and then finish it off with this wonderful continuation.",1376006400,,1820,4.616822429906542

Sure, the scenery is nice, but we're supposed the believe the rugged Jim Craig spent five YEARS in isolation before coming back for Jessica - time enough for Jessica to have moved on, now engaged to some cad.

The depth of character which made the first movie great is long gone here.  Now that Spur finally found his gold, the rugged mountain men have been supplanted by prospectors (bordello and all); Jim ends up in all sorts of contrived contests with his new rival (this ends up being the main plot of the film); and the teddy bear-like Brian Dennehy shouldn't be allowed to tie Harrison's boots, much less play his part.

If you found the first movie to be a work of cinematic art, spare yourself from spoiling it, and stay away from this shamefully coattailed sequel.",1300320000,,897,4.546583850931677
478585,5,6302481791,"Sequels are often not as good as the original movie. 'Return to snowy river' as a sequel to 'The man from snowy river' is almost as good as the original. The strength of the sequel is in the continuation of the story, while retaining the two lead actors (Tom Burlinson and Sigrid Thornton) in their original roles, outstanding cinematography and original score that are even better than in the first movie. The only thing missing is Kirk Douglas.  Brian Dennehy's Harrison is just adequate, but he has less scope for acting than Douglas did in TMFSR. Both lead actors (Burlinson and Thornton) are outstanding in their roles. The supporting cast is good, but the story demands less from them than from the cast of the first movie.

'Return to snowy river' is more action oriented and more romantic than the original. It is entertaining and thrilling. The part where Jim Craig gets to ride the stallion is particularly exciting.  The visuals of the Australian Alps, horses running through water, through sand, and horse riding stunts are spectacular. At the end of 'The man from snowy river' Jim Craig tells Harrison (Kirk Douglas) that he would come back for Jessica. He returns after 3 years in the story, but six years had passed between the original movie and the making of its sequel, so the two main characters look considerably older (and sometimes better) than in the original. The plot is simpler and rather one dimensional- good guy vs. bad guy, but it is an entertaining movie, and it remains one of my favorites. I like watching the two movies as a series because it sort of completes the story.

The only complaint I have is that on the DVD of 'Return to Snowy river' the subtitles are not exactly accurate. They leave out some words spoken by the characters, though no major damage is done. If you don't watch the movie with subtitles, it's a non-issue. In my case, after watching the movie many times without the subtitles I was still having difficulty understanding some of the Aussie accent, so I decided to watch it with the subtitles and discovered the minor omissions. Since this is a minor issue, I still gave it 5 stars.

Overall, I love this sequel.  It is exciting to see the 'Man'from Snowy River back, with his great horse riding skills, and with his life with the woman he loves.",1298160000,,2304,4.676543209876543

There's no Harris in this one, no Spur, no Clancy, no one-liners. This ""sequel"" will leave you feeling empty inside, empty and nausious...like you just had a second helping of Wallaby Stew.

  I was such a fan of The Man From Snowy River that when this sequel hit theaters, I was there about every other weekend watching it.  When it was released to video, I was horrified.  Gone was the beautiful photography that helped make it so enjoyable.  Some stuff is so chopped up that the entire purpose of the shot is lost, let alone just being able to tell what the heck is going on in the action sequences.
  For Disney to continue to release this only as a pan & scan feature is an offense to Cinematographer Keith Wagstaff, Director Geoff Burrowes, and to all the fans of the film that deserve to see it as it was filmed and the way the filmmakers meant it to be viewed.

478714,3,6302481791,"This sequel to MFSR is better than most films of its kind, but lags a bit in comparison to the original movie. The soap opera element between Jim and Jessica is poured on much thicker here, with many a longing look and half-open mouth, but with a corresponding lessening of focus on the mountain people, Australia during that time period, and their use of background culture. There was something more painterly about the first film's use of the scenic highlands. This film seems to rush along faster, and the plot points are more predictable. Apparently they cut a wedding scene out of the final film, so you are left with the impression that Jim and Jessica are ""shacking up"", which seemed very inconsistent with Jim's character's sense of honor. My wife commented that Jim's hair looked way too good for a mountain rancher who had just fallen down a hill and had his horse roll over him. Brian Dennehy eventually settles into the role of Harrison, but in the early scenes he and Sigrid Thornton definitely come off as acting at each other rather than being father and daughter. Dennehy works it out, but doesn't seem like a man who could tame the wilderness. Kirk Douglas had a lot more of that wild primitive fire quality. It is odd that Jim's inheriting of half the gold-mine operations was abandoned -- my wife commented that she thought that Jim's claim on Jessica's affections and capability of supporting a wife was all settled at the end of the first film. And the idea that the wild stallion would ever allow Jim to ride him (with no foreshadowing or halfway reasonable explanation why the horse would change his wild ways just for this one guy) was a deus ex machina -- or an equus ex machina, I guess.

A wild horse is not going to go tame for one important ride as if he understands everything. The overall plot was ""Disneyfied"" which was a detraction from the original characters. Also some details from the first movie were forgotten, such as the fact that Jim Craig owned his father's half share in the mine. However, it was nice to have a wrap up of the characters we knew and loved in the original.

My guess is that ""Uncle Walt"" would've eventually done right by home releases of his films, despite The Wonderful World of Color's full-screen broadcasts on which many of us grew up. He's probably spinning in his grave.

This means you're only seeing about 1/2 to 2/3 of the original frame of the movie.  And, if you're like me and have a widescreen set up, it looks even worse.  There is a solution if you're a serious fan.

478767,4,6302481791,"This is one of those soaring, melodramatic epics, set as a sequel to the classic film ""The Man From Snowy River.""  It's a typical action-adventure love story, laden with turgid emotional scenes, where the hero gets plenty of triumphal moments and everybody gets what they deserve in the end.

The movie is set apart from most by its stunt work, cinematography, scoring, top notch actors and classy style of filming.  This movie is also suitable as family entertainment, though this in no way takes away from its overall quality.

Plot wise, there are several engaging storylines, well knitted together and leading to a thrilling climax.

Fans of the first film should also be pleased to see the return of the prize colt, who Jim and Jessica trained in the first film, making his racing debut.

This film seems to be frequently overshadowed by its predecessor.  But I think it's a more polished product; the actors look better, the editing is smoother, the stunts are more daring, the cinematography is more expansive.  It come across as a more mature film overall, which is really what it's supposed to be.

The cinematography is notably fabulous, and the dramatically flighted score matches it perfectly.  Many prefer Mr. Douglas in the first film, but I thought Brian Dennehy did the role a lot of justice.

The social commentary implicit in some of the storylines can get a bit heavy-handed.  Some of the characters are saved from being too stereotypical only by the skin of their scripts and some good acting.  There are times when the dialogue skates the edge of cheesiness or the plot line takes a turn into improbability.  But the overall strength of the acting and filming always manages to pull it through.

This film is especially noted for its stunt work with horses.  As a rider and horse lover myself, I've seen pretty much every horse movie out there and 99% of them just can't pull it off.  The action in this one is just mind blowing, very realistic and filmed with incredible intensity.  Even better, all the horses are gorgeous and the main actors are fabulous riders, who you actually get to see doing most of their own riding stunts.  In my mind, it still sets the standard for horseriding action in film.

Overall, this is a great old fashioned drama, and a wonderful experience on film.

Notes:
The internet fosters some reaaallllly wild ideas.

The movie ""The Man From Snowy River"" is based on the famous poem of the same name, by Banjo Patterson, considered to be a national treasure in Australia.

Several other reviews have mentioned the idea that a horse died onset.  The rumor is specifically concerned with one scene, where a horse named ""Denny"" (please note this is the name of the character's horse and not the real horse - you can confirm it with subtitles) is shown falling down the side of a mountain.

Being an avid horse lover, I spent some hard hours ferreting out the source and veracity of the rumor.

A check at the American Humane Association's online ratings site revealed a review for ""Return to Snowy River,"" which rated the movie as ""Unacceptable."" But the review had several inconsistencies, which I contacted them about directly (they're very prompt in answering emails).

It stated only that they had received a report from Australia that a horse had died on set; no further contact was ever made and the report remains unconfirmed.

The problem is that AHA does not monitor films made in foreign countries, nor do they accept ratings from foreign animal welfare agencies.  So the the film should be listed as ""Not Monitored.""  In sum, the rating appears to have no legitimacy based on their own rules.

Further research yielded the fact that the Lovicks, who were responsible for supplying all the horses for the film, will confirm they owned the main horse actor who played ""Denny"" up until his death and that no horses died onset.  They have a website you can contact them through.

Finally, there seems to be an underlying confusion as to how horses are actually used in film.  The main animal ""actor"" in any film has multiple doubles for handling the work.  I myself counted at least 3 different ""Dennys,"" which an experienced eye can easily pick out.  In movies, there are special stunt horses trained to ""fall"" for any scene where a horse goes down.  A ""fall"" horse and rider did the controversial scene on the mountain, not the main horse who played ""Denny.""  Nor, of course, was anybody falling down a mountain; the camera angles simply make it appear so.  The stunt is common, and capable of being filmed safely.",1107475200,23,4570,4.765903307888041

 My only complaint with the movie: the Stallion develops the ability to tell ""the good guys"" from ""the bad guys,"" and I much preferred Douglas over Dennehy.

 Otherwise, more great riding, great scenery, great horses. Can't argue with that.

478798,5,6302481791,"There are some people you don't soon forget. Jessica Harrison (Sigrid Thornton) has never quite gotten over Jim Craig/The Man from Snowy River (Tom Burlinson). In the first movie, he promises to come back for what is his.

When he does return, the scenery has changed. The high country hasn't changed as much as the people have changed.

Jessica's father (Brian Dennehy) wants her to marry Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eadie). When she sees Jim for the first time since his return, one of the first things she wants to know is why it has taken him so long to return. It seems he has been trying to prove his worth to her by raising horses and trying to make a future for them both.

At first it seems Jessica is going to follow the wishes of her father, yet we know that she has quite the mind of her own and when Jim asks: ""What do you want?"" Jessica replies: ""I want you."" She doesn't have to think twice because her heart is free. Together Jim and Jessica are really like two wild horses at heart. They don't want to be tied down to the life everyone else has determined for them.

Jessica has always been judged for who she is and not for what she is. Her heart can only be tamed by Jim Craig and she is even willing to give up everything she holds dear to make him happy. Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eadie) holds her attention briefly, but the minute she sees Jim you know she hasn't forgotten him as he is the only man who truly knows how she feels about life and love. Alistair turns out to be vindictive and cruel. He not only wants Jessica, he wants to destroy Jim.

This sequel has way more action scenes that are even more spectacular than the first movie although a bit less artistic in places. I still love the scene in the first movie where the horses run through the snow. In this movie, there are gorgeous scenes of horses swimming through rivers and running across the Australian mountains. Quite frankly, it is all quite stunning and the sheer power of the horses can be felt throughout the scenes.

The black stallion plays a significant role in either destroying or healing situations to the point you can't decide if you like him or not. It is as if everything he does causes some extreme situation.

It is highly recommended that you watch the first: ""The Man from Snowy River"" because they don't repeat information that would make the background behind the feuds much more clear.

When two souls are destined to find one another, they do. Jim and Jessica seem to be able to weather any storm that comes their way, even when the future looks very bleak.

After all, life is an adventure to be lived to the fullest and sometimes you have to set someone free from your heart to see if they will one day come back.

But he finds that a lot of things have changed. The succesful ranchers and bankers want to buy up all of the land of the beautiful Australian mountains where he was brought up. He also finds that Jessica's father, Harrison (Brian Dennehy) wants her to marry Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eadie), son of landowner Patton Sr. (Rhys McConnochie). With a sort of silent feud between the landowners and the mountain men going on, Jim and Jessica must decide if they're love is worth firing up the feud even worse.
As most of the cases, I prefer the first movie to ""Return to Snowy River"" though I think they both deserve 5 stars. One of the reasons is I enjoy the first one more is that Kirk Douglas played Harrison in the first movie. Yes, Brian Dennehy was superb in that role, I still like Kirk Douglas.
All right, to the fine parts of the movie. Beautiful and magnificent scenery of the Australian mountains! Excellent acting by all actors and actresses, the suspense, action, and adventure will keep you on the edge of your seats! And Tom Burlinson sure know how to ride when he performs some pretty cool stunts while riding horses. Especially the earlier part of the movie where he proves that he can certainly ride better than Nicholas Eadie who plays the part of the jealous bad guy for Jessica's affection.
I recommend this movie along with the first movie, ""The Man from Snowy River"". These movies are classics and one of the family movies I watch at home. Can't be missed!",1006300800,114,1642,4.626712328767123
478800,5,6302481791,"In my opinion a truly wonderful film. As good if not better than the first. My favorite part has to be when Jim shows how to ride the skill at arms course in a way only he can pull off, and the tip of the hat to Jesseca when he is finished is perfect.",1001116800,2,251,3.6666666666666665
478801,5,6302481791,"Had to buy a second copy -- wore out my first!  One of the rare instances when the sequel is equally as good as the original.  The music is amazing (be sure to get the soundtrack), and the scenery breath-taking. I cannot recommend this movie enough!",994118400,,249,4.391304347826087
478802,5,6302481791,"This is probably the best sequel ever made, as compared to the story line of the original. Jim is back, and he is ready to get what's his...Jessica. But, now stands in his way, a Military loving snob. A very bratty Patterson. In this film are two scenes that are outstanding (Athough the rest of the film equally blends with their strength>) One is triumphant and the other traumatic, A battle of skill won, and a dear friend lost. I recommend this film one hundred percent, and challenge you to also buy its predecessor! Both are moving, great, adventures of will and determination. Strap yourself in for the ending mate!",984700800,,622,4.663636363636364
478803,3,6302481791,"This film is good but not as good as the first film. It is a lot more brutal, and it is a pity that Kirk Douglas was not acting in it. It is sad too. The first video was based on the poem by Banjo Paterson, and the book by Elyne Mitchell. This film was just an invention by the producers. It is quite a good film though. And the horses are wonderful.",978566400,,350,3.808219178082192
478804,5,6302481791,"Well, I have to say that this movie was even better then the first.  It  was great.  As Jim comes home to the high country he comes to reclaim his  love after a long time.  He no longer is welcome.  Jessica is trapped  between he father and her lover and another man trying to get even.  Wow,  what a movie the scenery was even better in this one then it was in the  last.  Jim returns to snowy river and what a comeback he makes.  Watch this  movie its the best!!!",966816000,2,465,3.978021978021978

Warning - this DVD is in Fullscreen format, not widescreen.  You lose a lot in Fullscreen, especially on a movie with such beautiful vistas.",1523923200,,311,4.618181818181818
