8601961,5,B004CFXJAC,"Canta Juego is wonderfully entertaining and educational. The group sings in Spanish and entertain with fun choreography. The DVD is fun for children and parents, entertainment for the entire family! Also, the title of each song appears before and after the song is done. Some songs have cartoons or the actual group of entertainers appear on certain songs. I think it is a good mix of entertainment for children to enjoy for a wide age range. My son is 11 months and he loves to watch this DVD because he loves songs and dancing entertainment. You can not go wrong with this purchase, worth the money. Also, you can preview various videos of the group Cantata Juego on You Tube if you would like to check some samples prior to purchase.",1360022400,,736,4.625954198473282
