8079456,5,B000ASATK8,"I first saw this version of ""Ah! My Goddess"" online via another legal video streaming service and I fell in love with it.  I'm a huge fan of the OVA and this was done by the same director/producer Hiraoki Goda.

This anime is excellent for those who are either new to Anime or for those who like Fantasy and ""Slice of life"" anime. It's characters all have great stories and the overall story arc reaches a nice climax at the last show of the first season, and finishes in the first episode(s) of the 2nd season.
Great good guys, some moronic fall-back characters, wonderful bad guys (not very dangerous overall) and great mix of romance and missed opportunities by both of the protagonists.",1418515200,,690,4.6016260162601625
8079457,5,B000ASATK8,"I think the title of this volume - Love Plus One - truly explains its nature. Love means, undoubtedly, the relationship between Belldandy, a gentle innocent goddess from the heaven, and Keich, a stressed-out college student. So, then, what is ONE? In first episode, it is Keich's younger sister Megumy who became a freshman and moved from the region of Hokaido. In third episode, ONE is Urd, Belldandy's older sister who came down from the heaven to advance Belldandy and Keich relationship. Urd makes the series far more interesting and I think I am not alone on that point. In second and forth episode, ONE is Sayoko and Aoshima. Sayoko actually already appeared and even crashed once with Belldandy in the first volume but in this volume her frontline against Belldandy reveals its full power. Aoshima, the top playboy of the campus, joined to Sayoko, because yes... he wants Belldandy. These two people try to tear off the couple by all means like kidnapping, detention, and even torturing. And, their attempts make the series cheesy funny. In the fifth episode, nothing like real big happens. The Sayoko & Aoshima alliance still tried schemes against Belldandy and Keich but the episode itself is somewhat focusless. Oh, by the way, Sayoko officially lost her campus queen title to Belldandy in episode four. The increasing commune will be complete when the youngest sister of goddess, Skuld, joins in next volume. That means, Keich and Belldandy are not living together alone by themselves now. Keich did not make anything happen with Belldandy during the past alone times and now he got pushy Urd who is literally pushing his back to Belldandy's room to make something happen. I was always enchanted how they make this seemingly simple romantic love story frame in this funny way. So many movies are carpeted with affairs and exposed scenes but still quite boring. This one is very different. Beautiful songs and colorful pictures are a great treat for this series too.",1149292800,2,1976,4.954819277108434
8079458,5,B000ASATK8,I Thought the dvd was cute and very animated. It's probably the best dvd I ever gotten.,1142294400,,87,4.176470588235294
8079459,5,B000ASATK8,"For those of us who got used to the somewhat tamer pace of the first DVD, this one is quite a change. The moments with the principles alone are still worth their weight in gold, but they're also less frequent thanks to new cast members.
 The relationship begins to make progress in spite of the principles obvious inexperience, thanks in part to the help of Megumi and Urd. Keiichi also gains a rival (sort of) and has to learn to stick up for both himself and his goddess. Along the way, tender moments are shared, and challenges are met and the relationship evolves (though somewhat glacially). Though this series has been dismissed as harem anime (which doesn't make sense since the ultimate pairing is not a question of who, but how) don't let that stop you. This series has a depth that other anime can only dream of.",1136073600,,822,4.554054054054054
8079460,5,B000ASATK8,"Man, they made it all fun for how the introduced Urd and Megumi into the series. Heck, the producers did one better again than just simply adhering to the old manga.

Kinda funny how Urd got introduced this time, as did Megumi. It makes one wonder how Peorth and Skuld will come into all this. And 'any' fan of the AMG Movie should love the opening scene of episode 8. Seeing Heaven itself was just gorgeous as well, and the themes keep expanding for the better.

I just can't help but feel the melding of several formats of the AMG/OMG landscape are melded together very smoothly. I also see a tendancy not to stick to the manga too hardcore. The scene where Aoshima tries to get his way, it was made more part of the episode 7 story arc, rather than it's own story altogether, like the manga did. The 'sorta' made it feel rushed though in episode 10 with the race (lip service to the drivers Aoshima hired was a bit too low key for me.) Overall though, it all was mostly well done, especially in the romantic areas (and the messes Urd causes after her arrival.) One thing I did like (personally speaking..) was seeing the females seem more forward than they felt like from the manga. (Seeing Bell mad was a riot.. =^^= )

What is kinda strange/corny/ect.. and more, is when the goddesses make obvious use of their powers in public, especially during the campus 'queen' event at the start of episode 9 (which is wierd to do 'that' all as a prolouge to the episode.) It all kinda makes you wonder how ditzy the combined campus is, but then it all is more humorus to myself, than anything bad. Aoshima and Sayuka though get 'wierd' on top of this. Just more laughs there.

Can't wait till next month to see what the heck Mara starts doing. Worse when Skuld shows up, and goddess knows about the bug problem and all. Overall, I keep being enthraled as a fan of the series with this release. It makes me wonder though, again, how much the timeline of the manga will be changed to fit the story, rather than just adhering to the manga. If such, the placement of the Urn and all that severe mess comes to mind as plot drama.

And if anyone warns me in advance about this, I'll borrow some bombs from Skuld. In other words, for those that haven't seen the entire series yet, the coming volumes will be an honest treat.

Till next month then (or February more likely..) =^^=",1134345600,2,2367,4.392694063926941
8079461,5,B000ASATK8,"What can ya say about Ah! My Goddess?  It's happily infectious, upbeat while retaining deeper tones, and very well drawn.  Rather than a lot of other downer anime out there, Goddess takes the road less traveled.  No fatalistic theme that overrides the whole series, with Goddess there actually IS light at the end of the tunnel.

This's one of those series that makes ya reaffirm your belief in the simple magic of being alive, be it living with a cosmic angel or your own mundane friends.  It'll help rekindle your sense of wonder and zest for life, and THAT is a beautiful thing.

Now if only I could figure out that number Keiichi misdialed.  Urd's a fox! Grrr, very grrr.",1133913600,5,675,4.575
