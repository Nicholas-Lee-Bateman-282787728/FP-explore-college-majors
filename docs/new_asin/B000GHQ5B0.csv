I had an older tape that I loaned someone to help them sleep and never got it back. So I ordered this one to replace it. The only difference in the two is this has a long lecture in the beginning which I always have to forward fast through. If I ever have a problem with stress and can't sleep I can put this tape in and I'm out in less than 5 mins. It's definitely something you'd want to have on hand having that kind of effect.
As far as Astrally projecting goes I've heard people have done it but I can't get past the falling asleep stage no matter how awake I start out. So if anyone has any other tips that may be of use please share. Thanks. I'd really love to believe it's possible.",1309132800,3,785,4.006369426751593
8132322,5,B000GHQ5B0,"I got this VHS tape, yes I am probably one of a few who still has one! I wanted to see how seminars work..without spending a fortune to go to one. I was not disappointed with this purchase! I also got a much newer ""2011"" seminar on DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Astral-Projection-Secrets-and-Methods-DVD/dp/B0050NW2Y4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Astral Projection Secrets and Methods (DVD)</a>&nbsp;to see the advancements from the 80's to now. There has been alot! Lots of new methods and the old proven ones revamped. I highly recommend both. I tried reading a book, but to me books seem like reading instruction manuel to set a VCR. The DVD's is much easier to follow and less time consuming.",1305244800,3,743,5.702702702702703
8132323,5,B000GHQ5B0,"I bought this years ago and used it on a regular basis for quite some time, and got out of my body to travel about the first time I used it.  These relaxation techniques are very good.  I was able to remember everything when I 'woke up' and wrote them all down.  It is amazing how much detail you can recall!  I absolutely loved it, and had no troubles.  I can't physically get about easily, so this was and is my way of seeing the world.  It is fantastic!  I even met my husband while out and about.
