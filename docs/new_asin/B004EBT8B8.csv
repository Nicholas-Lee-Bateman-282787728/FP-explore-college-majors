The story was good, I liked the dialog, and the songs were fun. I've only gotten it today, but I've watched it twice. One time by myself, and once w/ my family.",1468281600,,303,4.066666666666666
8426660,5,B004EBT8B8,"I loved REDHEAD CUBAN HAUSFRAU HUSBAND -- the CD is one of my favorites, but the DVD is even better.  Here is where you get all the drama and comedy between the songs, the personalities really come to life.  And the acting is incredible, especially from Liz Kennedy (REDHEAD) and Jodi Skeris (HAUSFRAU.)  There are so many little details to their performances, you have to watch the play several times for it all to sink in. The tension of their friendship really comes through in a way that makes you feel glad and sad for them both.  I had no idea before this show how much there was to their relationship, on screen and off.  The two men are just as good -- the marital struggles between the Redhead and her philandering husband, the CUBAN, is a story every married couple should know.  There is something tragic about these famous comedians that makes the familiar story of their successful sitcom even more interesting -- and heartbreaking.  Watching this musical is like reading an entire book of the history of the show -- the hirings and firings, the fights and the friction all come to life right before your eyes.  And of course there are the awesome songs -- even the choreography is great, bringing memories of the famous sitcom to mind.  Much better than the made-for-tv movies about this popular tv series and the famous actors behind it.  I've seen the play live and the DVD is an awesome representation.  Lots of camera angles, terrific editing, you feel like you're there, in several different seats at once.  I definitely recommend this for any fan of the original 50's TV series or its wonderful stars, or for fans of TV history or history in general, and anybody who likes a great stage musical.  Basically, I recommend this for anybody and everybody!  I only hope the show comes back for another run, or that another producer has the good sense to do another stage production.  It could run in Vegas or Palm Springs forever!",1304640000,,1945,4.646198830409356
