The Story: After meeting with a perfect stranger, Mona isn't so sure anymore about her feelings for her boyfriend. So she breaks up with him. Hoping that she'll take him back, he decides to mail himself to her, just to witness her about to make out with the handsome stranger. And when comes the time to open the box, Mona accidentally kills her EX boyfriend.

If you think this all is ridiculous, the ridiculous stuff just starts about there and i thank god and probably FAIRUZA BALK for appearing as the lead of a ridiculous comedy instead of making it a romantic comedy. She probably would have hated, and me too. Sure, the movie makes no sense, the jokes make a lot less sense, but the guy in me still like a punky chick making a dead guy inhale and having the smoke poor out from his skull!! But i love Hudo Kier, and a couple more scenes involving his character would have made the movie even funnier imo.

This is a short, surprising little comedy. A fast pace, all hail the ridiculous contender, if not anything else.

It would have been a better movie if it had been an animated cartoon, I think.  I am sure that I have seen less-funny movies, but none that were categorized as comedies.",1255910400,,269,4.215686274509804

7896310,3,6305809585,"This is a strange film and perhaps the simplest way to explain that is to say that Fairuza Balk and Debbie Mazur play sisters, which is easily believable given their complementary facial features, but they happen to be blonds.  Making either one of them blond strikes me as strange so do it for both of them and you can square the strangeness.  If you want more proof that this is a strange film, take into account that ""Life in the Fast Lane"" is the DVD title.  Originally it was ""There's No Fish Food in Heaven,"" which I can tell you actually makes more sense but almost by default since it really applies only to the film's punch-line.

This hybrid of a romantic comedy and a black comedy begins with Mona (Balk) dumping her boyfriend Jeff (Noah Taylor).  He wants to get back with her so he comes up with the bright idea of having himself mailed to her in a giant box.  What Mona might think about this act of quiet desperation becomes a moot point when Jeff ends up dead.  However, this does not stop Jeff from continuing to talk to Mona, who is the only one who can see his spirit.  Meanwhile, Mona is enthralled by The Stranger (Patrick Dempsey), who saves her when a gargoyle falls off of a church and almost hits her.  The Stranger is devilishly mysterious (hint, hint, hint) and Mona keeps seeing him in the strangest places as he keeps trying to seduce her (on several levels apparently).  Now if Mona could just figure out why the things she is painting keep coming true, because this is all starting to freak her out.

While Mona deals with Jeff and The Stranger, she also has to put up with her pregnant sister, Rosie (Mazar), Minister Pete (Jeffrey Jones), a mother who likes to not only do but also spell ""decoupage"" (Caroline Aaron), a car thief who is into poetry (James LeGros), and a transvestite dentist (K. Todd Freeman) named Stan (or Susie) who likes to seduce serial killers.  So there is mondo quirkiness in this film written and directed by Eleanor Gaver (""Slipping Into Darkness"") but it does not quite click.  Still, I do like the place where this film ends up even if the path there is rather torturous and it becomes impossible to connect all the dots, at least for me.  Then again, maybe this film, whatever its name, will click for you, in which case it would go up at least a star because if you are looking for a different independent film this would certainly be in the running.",1137715200,,2414,4.469248291571754
7896311,4,6305809585,"Any one that would want to watch this film or likes it is for no other apparent reason than the blued eyed beauty Fairuza Balk.  Any Fairuza fan such as myself will love this movie.  She is the only character in the film that is worth mentioning and the entire film revolves around her.  This film is very bizarre.  The plot is very strange and difficult to understand.  Watching this film the first time can leave the impression that there is no plot, but there is.  Despite the bizarre events and wierd characters in the film, there is actually a plot with a meaning.  After watching this film for the third time I finally understood the meaning behind the plot.  After understanding the bizarre meaning to the film, you can actually come to appreciate the film even more.  Fairuza fans that are out there, this is the film for you!",1037836800,7,834,4.506666666666667
