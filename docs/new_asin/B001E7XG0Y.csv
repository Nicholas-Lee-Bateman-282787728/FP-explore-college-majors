8297075,3,B001E7XG0Y,"We were excited to add another ""Little People"" video to our collection.  Our two daughters (3 and 1.5 years) LOVE these family friendly videos.  The individual who sold us ours shipped from England.  Upon arrival, we discovered that it would not play in our old DVD player.  It plays in my computer, but the characters speak with British accents.  Not a complete loss, but it is a bit confusing for my daughters.  I don't know if all of the videos are this way or if we just got a British version of the DVD.",1318636800,3,508,4.351063829787234
