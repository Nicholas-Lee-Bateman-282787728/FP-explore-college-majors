8353291,5,B0026OIBKE,"I knew alot of what was covered in the video.  How to make new tracks, how to use the loop browser, how to record, and so on.  However it was a very good discussion for people who are completely new to recording.  I did find the discussion about mixing and adding effects very useful, though, about using separate ""wet"" and ""dry"" signals to mix together an effect, the concept of ""subtractive"" track equalization, and how he briefly touched on automation recording.  I think I finally get the point of a MIDI control surface as a result and plan to purchase a small one such as a Korg Micro.  I also picked up on how to use multiple elements in Dimension LE, and now I can make a big pile of new sounds and presets of my own thanks to that brief demo.  Everyone who's new to recording and new to Sonar HS7 XL should look at this, as it will make a difference.",1270771200,3,859,4.2392638036809815
