8606718,5,B00ELNMZZ0,"This is a X version including explicit sex in action. The story is about the coming-of-age Bimba.  Her dream and wanting of opposite sex drives her
to abnormal activities in the family castle.  Playing sex on her toys and with nurse-nun are not enough. She likes to peep on her father's sex with
his sister-in-law whose husband is very sick.  To the worst, she plays with her uncle lying sick on bed. A fellatio gives him a heart attack.  This story's ending is surely a tragedy.  Her uncle's death is accompanied with a second death.  This time, the nurse-nun deeply feels her sin for not stopping Bimba's misconduct and she jumps from the roof to death.
Brief sexual encounters are unlike other hard-core movies.  Castle setting decodes a mystery in the family.  Italian humor is all there.  Overall, a good movie.",1456531200,5,816,4.7304964539007095

8606721,5,B00ELNMZZ0,"KINO Films is proud to unleash one of the most degenerate treasures in EuroSleaze history! Delicious Katell Laennec (in her one and only screen appearance) stars as Bimba, a teenage temptress who plunges her entire family - including her widowed father, wanton aunt, invalid uncle and even a beloved nun - into the depths of sexual depravity. Is she possessed by demonic lust or just going through a really freaky puberty? Evil hungers for the ultimate in unholy pleasure. The Devil demands MALABIMBA!

The gorgeous Mariangela Giordano (SATAN'S BABY DOLL) and voluptuous Patrizia Webley (SALON KITTY) co-star in this sex-crazed shocker from Andrea Bianchi (infamous director of STRIP NUDE FOR YOUR KILLER and BURIAL GROUND). Officially released on DVD for the first time anywhere in the world via an exclusive pact with Satan himself! in English or Korean with subtitles in both",1304899200,,878,5.183098591549296
8606722,3,B00ELNMZZ0,"This isn't really a horror film rather it's a sexploitation film with horror elements and it's fun.  The Dead spirit of a woman wreaks havoc when she possesses a young girl.  Who then seduces people in her family. The severin version has no real porn scenes in it which were edited into some versions. This version only is soft core people pretending to have sex and that's makes it sexploitation all the way.  The director is the same man who gave us the classic giallo 'strip nude for your killer"". Like many Italian directors he of course had to try his hand at sexploitation and he suceeds here.  The horror element is played down in regards to the
sex aspect but if you think about what's happening to the young girl it is horrible. She tries to seduce her father even.  We do get nudity here and lots of it but still not the same as what you'd see in a porn movie at all.  It's soft core , like a ""emmanuele"" movie.  Which are fun; but this movie caused outrage in it's day unlike those movies.  It's part of the horror family though due to it's possession aspects but it's really for fans of sexploitation, which can entertaining in it's own regards.",1245974400,4,1157,4.39906103286385
8606723,4,B00ELNMZZ0,"Bought this movie for $20 somewhere else but i'm not sure if this is the right place to put info for it.  The version i bought is from Severin, widescreen, in italian with english subtitles, and says unrated version in front and not rated in back.  The cover looks exactly the same as the others with the black background, but this one has a dark red background.  The back of the box says it runs 85 minutes.  Using the time display on my dvd player, it runs just under 87 minutes(most sites i've read have it running at 88 minutes excluding the hardcore inserts, which makes it break 90+ minutes i think).

Extras include:
*  deleted scenes - runs at 15 minutes and are of varying video quality.
*  integral version - the option to watch the film with the deleted scenes re-inserted.  this version runs 96 minutes.  obviously 87 + 15 is not 96 minutes.  the deleted scenes include some footage already in the 87 minute version, hence the discrepancy.
*  malabimba uncovered - 17 minute featurette with interviews of Mariangela Giordano(the nun in the film), and Franco Villa(the cinematographer, who says there were no hardcore scenes shot for the film).
*  trailer - 4 minute trailer that has a few seconds of non-explicit footage that is NOT SEEN in either version on this disc(the death by fellatio scene).

Anyway, it's all kinda confusing to me, but i guess i got the slightly cut version.  I could care less about the non-related, x-rated inserts; but the missing minute or so bothers me.  I don't know what i'm missing exactly but judging on what's there, it still has a handful of sex scenes, lots of nudity, attractive women, and a few 'thats uncalled for' moments(one invloving a teddy bear).

Besides the missing footage, the most disappointing thing about the film is its lack of scares or atmosphere.  If it weren't for the satanic possesion angle of the plotline, i wouldn't even consider it a horror film.  As a sexploitation/grindhouse type film, i'd say it's above par.  As an exploitation horror, i'd say it's below par.  So, if you're not offended by the possible missing minute or so, and are into plotlines that can be summed up in a few words(pubescent, possession, perversion) and mainly just an excuse for deparavity, i can recommend this.  3 1/2 stars for film, rounded up to 4 for extras(count off whatever stars you want for missing footage).",1236643200,16,2370,4.703883495145631
