8653978,4,B002LIZXBU,"I like this movie,  based off of primarily two things: first of all, I like it because it's a fairly  dark movie. with all the Disney movies going around, tainting about every classic fairy tale, it's nice to see a change of scene, where choices really DO affect the consequences. For example, if you cry Wolf, you WILL get eaten. My second reasoning of why I like this movie is because it has perhaps THE most hauntingly beautiful soundtrack I've ever heard. Joe Hisaishi is a musical genius, to say the least. If you like any of his music, this movie's soundtrack is phenomenal! The movie itself is a little odd, and perhaps a little low budget, but such is the expectation when dealing with foreign films. May you enjoy it as much as I did.",1356480000,2,743,4.455882352941177
8653979,5,B002LIZXBU,If your children love fairy tales but are being swamped with computer games they'll love this tale.  It has enough dark elements to have them on the edge of their seat.  Great for the smaller kids who think they can't win because everyone is bigger.,1338163200,,249,4.511111111111111
