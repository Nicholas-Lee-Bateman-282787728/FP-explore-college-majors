As for the content, the program was more about the Manatees than the Everglades.  It was still interesting and looked really good on my 4k TV.  The 3d had good depth, but not much OOS effects.

All in all, I did enjoy it very much and would recommend this title to any one into Nature documentaries and/or 3d.",1445644800,,513,4.151515151515151
8328985,2,B001O2UTUO,"Although this is a well made DVD it did not fit my expectations.  It was al about conservation.  I was looking for something to share, with my young grandchildren,  the wild animals that we had been able to see while vacationing in the everglades.  Although there were a few pictures of animals most of it was ariel views of landscape.",1424044800,,335,4.533333333333333
8328986,2,B001O2UTUO,"This video has some interesting information; the narrator gives you a little background about the Everglades area. There are also some nice aerial views of the swamp throughout the video.  However, if you are seeking a visual feast of wildlife photography or detailed information about native species...this video will disappoint.  Most of the program follows a wildlife photographer who is kayakking through the Everglades.  She is a strange choice for the roll, as she is from Germany.  It begs the question why they didn't have someone who had lived in the area their whole lives to follow - or at least been there at least once before?

One of the most interesting segments in the whole DVD is when they interview a middle-aged Floridian couple who have lived most of their lives on a houseboat in the Everglades and who go out everday and help people who have gotten lost.  In my opinion, they would have been much more interesting hosts - I was really interested in what they had to say.  But the program gives them only about 5 minutes then moves on.  Most of the photography of the show consists of us watching the German photographer paddle her canoe, look around, and point her camera at things.  Occasionally, we watch scientists slogging around in the mire, gathering samples - again, why are we looking at the humans and not the nature?  The narration sermonizes a little about the effects of human habitation.  I can see the purpose for this, however, again - why can't we have something nice to look out on the screen while we are listening to it?

Overall, I wouldn't recommend buying this DVD at full price.  It is definitely worth watching on TV or maybe buying used. I wouldn't recommend it all to nature program afficionados.  It wouldn't be good if you're writing a school report on the Everglades, either.  The information is rather basic and could probably be more easily obtained by 5 minutes of research on an internet encyclopedia site.",1267920000,10,1962,4.763313609467455
8328987,5,B001O2UTUO,Very informative with great filming!  Man must give up old ideas of tossing coins and hunting for sport to help preserve wildlife.  Preserving the world as it should be is far more important than man's petty desires.,1247356800,,216,4.8108108108108105
8328988,3,B001O2UTUO,"I've often heard that the Everglades have a rich biodiversity that man is rapidly destroying.  So in viewing this documentary, I kept wondering what novel information the work will present.
The doc is fresh in three ways.  It shows aerial views of the Everglades that are spectacular.  You get to see the proverbial forest, and not just the trees.  It made me realize that any person standing in the Everglades would be getting only a piece of the puzzle.  The flashy photography and pace here is appropriate for viewers in your rush-rush society.
Secondly, the work details the insightful work that scientists are doing to document the problems in the region.  They found that if you move intruder pythons, they'll just sliver back to where you found them.  They show that if alligators make fewer wells of water, fish have less places to branch out into.  The work had scientists with foreign accents present, so perhaps it's not just American scholars researching this matter.
The big problem is less human overpopulation and pollutants, but really the re-distribution of fresh water.  Water from Florida's largest lake used to feed the Everglades, but now it is feeding lawns and crops.  They showed a manatee sipping water from a human-made pipe and I almost got teary.  (This is so different from how I view mice or bugs that eat ice cream or candy off of discarded wrappers.)  Though this environment is novel in the way that fresh and salt water co-exist, the documentary shows how animals are basically being wiped out by thirst.
This work re-emphasized the connectedness of ecosystems.  If manatees can't find fresh water, they come near boats that slice them up.  If crocodile young die in salt water, they don't make water trails as adults that other species could use.
This work says many Floridians throw their unwanted fish into the Everglades and this has created invader species.  I was shocked to see that even trees are part of the problem.  How threw out some seeds from Brazil and caused some mess!?  In Louisiana, trappers get paid to kill invader nutrias, why can't Florida create a similar project?  It would help the economy and reduce unemployment, wouldn't it?
The work doesn't point to a tragic ending that I foresee.  There are no signs that Florida is decreasing in human population.  Supposedly, it's the IT-place to vacation and retire.  As humans keep moving there, and real estate developers keep salivating over ""unused"" land, I can't see how the Everglades will ever survive.",1241740800,5,2511,4.9168646080760094
