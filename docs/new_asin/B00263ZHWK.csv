If you wear the weighted gloves, it is more intense. I bought 1.5 lb gloves, and wow wee, my arms were sore! All in all, I think it is a good video. I am looking for something a little harder, but I am going to stick with Amy's workouts!",1349827200,,404,3.8795180722891565
8351780,1,B00263ZHWK,"If you are serious or even semi serious about working out with a heavy bag don't buy this. It is a piece of garbage that barely utilizes a heavy bag and the whole tape moves at a ridiculously slow pace! I barely got through the first segment without falling asleep.
I was looking for something to mix up and add to my Billy Blanks Impact workout which is only 1/2 hour. The Billy Blanks workout far surpasses this one even though I find that one slow paced too.
In my opinion, I would give this workout negative stars, five of them!",1331683200,3,532,4.2772277227722775
8351781,4,B00263ZHWK,I bought it for the heavy bag workouts but it only has a couple and they get pretty monotonous. Good workout tho.,1311984000,,113,4.181818181818182
8351782,5,B00263ZHWK,"Rumble is a lower intensity kick box workout, unlike Amy's other kickboxing DVDs.  I use this for a supplemental second workout when I want to do something, but nothing too intense.

The workout is filmed in the studio of Amy's dojo.  It's just Amy and Toni doing the moves.  Toni shows modifications.  It's about 80 minutes total; the first 40 minutes are straight kickboxing and the 2nd half is with a heavy bag.  Amy's dojo joins her for the final stretch.

I love the music in this workout.  There's something about the beat and the songs that grab me.  It gives me energy to workout.
I prefer the first part of the workout, which is done with weighted gloves.  The second part of the workout is done with a heavy bag and Toni shows modifications without a bag.  It's harder to follow, but I don't really mind since it gives me something to think about when I do the workout.

The final stretching section moves a bit fast and I go slower than Amy so I don't injure myself.

All in all, if you're looking for a different, lower intensity kickbox workout, this may be for you.  This is not typical of Amy's workouts, however, since it is slower paced and Amy is more subdued. It is still fun.",1276646400,8,1195,4.397260273972603
