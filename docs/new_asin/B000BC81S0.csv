8084942,2,B000BC81S0,"Permanent Vacation follows the aimless urban wanderings of Allie, a young wanna-be drifter who seems to have soaked up too much Kerouac and Charlie Parker. He considers himself a non-conformist, but fits the mold of a disillusioned beat hipster who pretends to be misunderstood. Contrary to what he leads himself to believe, it's he who lacks the self-esteem and motivation it takes to be accepted into regular society. Under these delusions, he sets off posing as an outsider in a run-down section of NYC.

The trouble with this film is the weak lead character (Allie) and the person (Chris Parker) who portrays him. Allie is the kind of dork who desperately tries to be ""cool"" like his idols. This act, coupled with his wimpy, whiny voice will likely induce gagging or provoke pity in most viewers. He's reminiscent of J.D. Salinger's Catcher In the Rye character, being a more pathetic and unimaginative version who spends most of his time just walking around, waiting for life to happen. The most ironic aspect about this film is that every other character who makes an appearance eclipses him. Much like Wim Wenders' Summer in the City, the urban landscape has more to offer than the lead character in terms of viewer interest. Even though there's not so much to enjoy in Permanent Vacation, it's something I would specifically recommend to: a) film students; b) Jim Jarmusch fans; c) anyone who likes NYC-based films; and d) teens/young adults who have a mindset similar to Allie's.",1483660800,,1488,4.9282868525896415

8084944,5,B000BC81S0,"I thought the film was very beautiful; I don't understand why it's considered weak Jarmusch!
It and 'Stranger Than Paradise' are my 2 fave Jarmusch films now.
The scene where Aloysious dances to Bostic's 'Up There in Orbit' is too cool for words.....
Loved it, loved it, loved it.",1446681600,,280,4.73469387755102

8084947,1,B000BC81S0,This is a terrible movie. A not-terribly-interesting guy walks around and does some not-terribly-interesting stuff. He has a girlfriend and lives in a dumpy little apartment. He's some kind of hipster. NOTHING HAPPENS.,1427328000,,218,5.636363636363637
8084948,1,B000BC81S0,"Because Jim Jarmusch was such a well-known participant of the '70s punk scene, i expected his film to be a decent representation of (the old) NYC and its residents thereof. This student film wouldve been fine if it had been 5 minutes long, but too drag out this nothingness for 75 mins is excrutiating; I had to fast forward through most of it. There is not enough dialogue to keep this film interesting, much less give it any meaningful plot. This insipid celluloid void is a tedious waste of time!",1365120000,2,499,4.555555555555555
8084949,3,B000BC81S0,"You can tell them by the way they talk...too cool for school baby.  To be fair, this was made in 1979 and most of it's imitators were much later.  There is a certain still beauty in some of the shots and a freedom for characters to simply ""be"" instead of always ""doing"" but it's still thin.  I'm glad the Germans liked this enough to permit Jarmusch to make his best films from about 1985 to 1999.",1365033600,,397,4.197368421052632
8084950,4,B000BC81S0,"This movies is about a young New Yorker, nothing to do but dancing under recorder in a factually empty room in lapidated house, shared with semi-unemployed girlfriend, hanging around in the messy uninhabited NYC areas of the last century eighties, supporting existence with thievery.

Also boredom and mental health state of pre-Juliani era grounded every moment of a movie, something romantic and attracting viewing definitely highlights talents of a producer, Jarmusch.

In new suite, a male character tries escaping somewhere-it seems, Staten Island was a destination as last fragments had shown.",1170460800,2,599,5.571428571428571
