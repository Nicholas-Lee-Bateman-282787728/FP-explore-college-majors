8339109,4,B001RXDPGA,There is a lot of excellent advice in this tutor video.  It is loosely presented so you will want to watch it a few time to catch the gems and if they have a reference number to the written version in the PDF.  I like the comping info talking about piano like movements of Bud Powell and Oscar Peterson.  Jack plays with a trio a couple tunes and it's always great to hear him play.,1481068800,,382,4.066666666666666
8339110,5,B001RXDPGA,"I go back to this workshop DVD over and over and over again.  I always learn something new.  Jack Wilkins is an incredibly gifted player, and the more advanced your own playing ability is, the more you will gain from studying his approaches to the pieces in the workshop.  In fact, the more often you return to this DVD, the faster you are likely to advance your own playing ability.

Jack Pearson and Charlie Dungey accompany Jack Wilkins, and these two are the perfect complimentary pair to make these tunes just soar.

At the end they share an original composition ginned up in the true spirit of improvizational jazz, and their interplay is worthy of high praise.  Jack Pearson's solo on this original composition by itself would be the high point in any other workshop, but because of Jack Wilkins and Charlie Dungey's excellence the Pearson solo is a memorable part of an overall excellent trio's work.  Charlie is no longer alive to participate, but I sure would love to see Jack Wilkins and Jack Pearson work together again.  It's a real treat to watch these two very different masters of jazz guitar.

If you're a fan of any of these three great jazz musicians, you'll want to own this DVD.",1473033600,,1199,4.644549763033176
