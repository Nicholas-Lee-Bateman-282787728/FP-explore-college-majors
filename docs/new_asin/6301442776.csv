8337755,5,6301442776,"""Put Magic in Your Game"" is the best instructional video for young kids I have ever viewed.  I have been coaching Jr. Pro basketball for 8 years now.  I have 10-11 year old boys and there are 32 teams in this  age group in Mt. Juliet. Last year we won the championship and as of now we  are 5-0 for this year (after loosing 4 starters).  In the past 6 years, 5  boys from our team, (out of 32 teams) have gone on to play for the local jr  high school and 3 others have moved to other cities and played for their  local school.  I encourage all of my players to at least rent it or if  they can, buy it.  I tell them to watch it as many times as possible.  I  believe this to be just as important as the actual practicing. I recommend  this video to anyone who is serious about basketball and improving their  game!",948499200,6,814,4.0
