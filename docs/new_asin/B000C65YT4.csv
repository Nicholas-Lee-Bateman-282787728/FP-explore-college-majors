8095754,5,B000C65YT4,"Our son loves the tv show so we tried the books.  He enjoys seeing the characters in book format and is quick to rattle off their names.  Its the association between seeing them on TV and then in a book that excites him most.  At less than 2 years of age, its become his favorite story collection (we own several others too).",1214611200,,325,4.209677419354839

8095756,5,B000C65YT4,"Young spider Squirt, alias Captain Sunnypatch, learns to fly beacuse he thinks that's what it takes to be a superhero. In the end, he learns that flight alone doesn't make a hero.  In all the Miss Spider videos, entertaining stories gently teach values to which we all should aspire: patience, courage, good manners, and devotion to family. Our 2-year-old loves all these videos and asks for them again and again.",1154822400,,413,4.9
8095757,5,B000C65YT4,"Everyone at our house (even the adults) loves Miss Spider! The stories, music, and characters are never annoying like many other kids' cartoons. The animation and scenery are amazingly detailed and beautiful, just like the books. The only difficulty with the DVDs is that you can't find the contents anywhere online! For those of you who would like to know before you buy, the stories included on ""Captain Sunny Patch"" are 1. Captain Sunny Patch  2. The Return of Captain Sunny Patch  3. Stalking the Beanstalk  4. Bedtime Story  5. Wiggle's Squiggles  6. A Time Telling Tale  7. Basketberry Blues  8. Stumped!

Great stories, every one!",1144195200,24,637,4.943396226415095
