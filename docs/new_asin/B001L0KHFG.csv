8458143,3,B001L0KHFG,"I have been stepping for years, but on a consistant basis for about a year now.  The Step Party 2 was a very intense work out and it got me sweating but, Katina does not give good instructions on the step movements she is doing. They are very complicated and I had to actually watch the video a couple of times to get the steps half way down. I feel there was not enough intruction on the movements therefore,I think this is a great purchase for an advanced stepper, but beginner and intermediates will have a hard time following her.",1240790400,8,534,4.34
