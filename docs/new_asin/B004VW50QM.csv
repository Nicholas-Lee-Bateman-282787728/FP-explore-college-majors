8444130,5,B004VW50QM,"Great instructional DVD on the music of Louis Armstrong, approached in the style of Rev. Gary Davis. Ernie's arrangements really capture the spirit of both Louis and Rev. Davis and are clearly presented in both the video and the accompanying booklet. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. This was perfect for my playing style and taught me a great deal about arranging in the piedmont style. Thanks Ernie!",1413244800,,401,4.742857142857143
