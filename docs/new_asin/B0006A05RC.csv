I remembered how I never missed a Friday night viewing when HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET appeared on NBC. In my opinion, this is the finest series ever to appear on television. The character development, the level of performance by the cast, and the story lines are all top-notch. To those interested in this genre, I recommend this highly. I've never purchased in such a zealous manner; I now own seasons 1-7 and recently purchased the now out-of-print movie. Awesome.

8040778,5,B0006A05RC,"Regarding the fact that english is not my first language, the only problem that I have with this package is the fact that I can't understand 100% of what is spoken. Even english subtitle would help, but nevermind...

Anyway, watching first episodes of Homicide is an event of epic proportions to me. It's like watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather 2"" for the first few times or listening to Metallica's life masterpiece ""Master of Puppets"" for the first few hundred times.
It is great, really! I speak about Homicide at the moment! ;-)
Brilliant acting, familiar faces...
It's really great and I'm just sorry I didn't get the chance to grab the whole 1-7 package.
Love it!",1191801600,,678,4.794871794871795

Homicide, Life on the street is one of the all time best drams series on TV and this set of the first 5 seasons was very competitivly priced, arrived quickly and in perfect condition and has given me many hours of viewing pleasure.",1125705600,,269,4.4
8040780,5,B0006A05RC,"Great news for fans of this wonderful series who do not live in the States.  Despite what they say, it is not Region 1 only and will play perfectly well on a Region 2 player.  I was all set to change my player to a region-free just for this series but imagine my surprise when i found I didn't have to because it worked perfectly.",1112140800,,330,4.061538461538461
8040781,5,B0006A05RC,"Homicide: Life on the Street is Baltimore's gritty police drama following the lives and cases of the Homicide detective of the Baltimore Police Department. Based on true stories - see the book Homicide by David Simon - the drama is at once real and comical. This 5 Season set is a MUST (especially at the price) for anyone interested in cop drama, great acting, and excellent story telling. I spent probably twice as much buying each season separately when they came out...you can benefit from the package deal.",1106784000,,511,4.818181818181818
