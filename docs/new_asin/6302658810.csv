Unfortunately it is ruined by a totally inappropriate sound track. It's an adventure flick for Pete's sake who had the bright idea to splice in a some very silly and bad 1960 style imitation Bert Kampfert music.  It RUINED the whole movie.  It's a serious film with carnival music written for 5 year olds as a sound track.
  Buy it if you want to know how not to select soundtrack music or just want to have a laugh.",1491177600,,555,4.330097087378641

7830288,1,6302658810,Poor storyline and poor unbelievable acting. If you want to see Stewart Granger in a better African adventure watch King Solomons Mines.,1395705600,,136,5.2272727272727275
7830289,1,6302658810,"This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.  Since I purchased the movie, I felt that I had to watch it but it was painful to do so.  I fast forwarded much of it because it was so bad and unbelievable.  Stewart Granger deserved a better fate than to be seen in such a movie.  Thank goodness that it was not any longer.",1300147200,2,329,3.8656716417910446
7830290,5,6302658810,"Miles Gilchrist (Stewart Granger) is a white hunter belonging to African Professional Hunters Association. He gets Casey (Kaz Garas) and Grant(Gabriella Licudi) as Safari Hunters who nearly get runover by a black rhino. Miles quits, but Casey wants him to be taken for foot safari and won't give up, and follows Miles around the Kenyan Countryside and Nairobi. Then Jama, a somali joins the group. Miles is haunted by the death of his friend while trying to photograph an elephant. 2 elephants charge and his friend dies. Miles wants to go back and take revenge against that bull elephant.
Then Miles rescues a white family from the Maasai and goes alone to hunt for this bull elephant into the northern frontier district(filmed actually near Magadi Soda and Tsavo East National Park, KENYA). Will Miles get his bull elephant? Will Casey stay back? What will happen to the wildlife of Kenya? The movie was made in 1967 and the VHS runs for 112 mts. Thankfully the VHS plays on my English VCR. Watch and enjoy the beautiful Kenyan countryside and listen to the good background music by John Darkworth. The director Henry Hathaway keeps the story moving well. The scenes of charging black rhinos and elephants are excellent.

7830291,5,6302658810,"This 1967 movie is starring Stewart Granger as Miles Gilchrist and Kaz Garas as Casey Ward in what must be their best roles. It is about two extremely competitive, proud, self center, determine, hard men. Their rivalry goes so far that they are willing to walk them selves to death then to be beaten by the other. They complete in everything they do. Casey who is the devil advocate, play's a young rich American who is very good at everything and pushes Gilchrist over the edge. Gilchrist who is a old, beaten and suicidal professional hunter refuses to be bested by a man he hates. They hate each other because they are so much alike. Gilchrist no longer has the guts or desire to go after the elephant he hates, but Casey keeps  pushing him. First by booking the elephant hunt and then by following him making sure he finally completes this dance he started with death years earlier.

  So Gilchrist sells all his processions, then Casey beats him by giving away all his belongings and then going native. Something a proud white African like Gilchrist could not do. Gilchrist defends the wild game aganist poachers. Next Casey beats him again by defending the honor of his paided high yellow (mix race) companion Gabriela Licudi. Again something the proud Gilchrist can not do. Later Casey pays her off and releases her as they lose themselves in the wildnerness. First in the plains of Kenya then to the desolate of Somanli where she is from. Granger can not beat the younger Casey just as they are both beaten by the younger Somali Jama. Who himself is beaten by the Elephant. Who time is running out for.",1139097600,8,1610,4.63859649122807
7830292,1,6302658810,"I first experienced ""The Last Safari"" a number of years ago. I went through a phase where I gobbled up every movie set in Africa.  ""The Last Safari"" proved to be a feature film of such mammoth ineptitude and unintentional hilarity that it has stayed with me ever since and, when I saw it for sale here at Amazon.com, I found myself purchasing a copy of it with surprisingly little trepidation.  Upon viewing it again, I must say that it remains a very special picture. It simultaneously presents to the film-goer (1) the sad, sad presence of Stewart Granger, a great adventure star of 40s and 50s movies, obviously in agony as he goes through the motions in every scene; (2) Kaz Garas, an actor who fits snugly into his blindingly annoying character, Casey, with frightening ease; (3) Gabriella Ligudi, who, as Grant, makes Casey look like a wondeful bed-mate under a mosquito net; (4) a groovily hip, yet dated-by-1966 depiction of Africa and its native inhabitants; (5) scenes of excruciating length and purposelessness that make a bout of malaria look enticing; (6) a jaunty musical score from 60s movie hell; (7) scenes of random, shocking violence that are intended as light comedy; (8) Kaz Garas dancing with Africans; (9) did I mention Kaz Garas; and (10), a tear-inducing moral to the story - tears of joy due to the fact that the film is finally over and that Stewart Granger may have a chance to still eke out an iota of redemption in his twilight years. The film utterly and completely destroyed my platonic conception of the classic African safari, replacing it with a new, horrific image of ""King Solomon's Mines"" stock footage, African tribal chiefs in Nehru suits, and joyful elephant slaughter.  In other words, I urge you to experience ""The Last Safari""!",971049600,5,1771,4.8
