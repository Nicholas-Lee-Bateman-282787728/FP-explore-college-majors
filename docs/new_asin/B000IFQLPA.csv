8145360,4,B000IFQLPA,"I purchased this because Lara Croft Rocks,and because I have played this and it is a very fun game. The content is superb,with over 4 hours of play time. I prefer to play this Solo so to me that's just fine,but I'm sure it would be very enjoyable to those who enjoy Tomb Raider. The one thing that really shines to me about this game is that,(unlike the actual video games) you can enjoy playing a Tomb Raider adventure without having to struggle with the controls which are quite daunting most of the time. So is it a perfect game? No! Is it a fun relaxing beer and pretzels game that scratches your itch to play Lara Croft? Absolutely! This is definitely a hidden gem worth picking up on so many levels.",1526601600,,705,4.348484848484849

8145362,2,B000IFQLPA,"I was one of the few people who actually enjoyed Angel of Darkness. The controls were absolutely terrible, but it made it a challenge and I was able to overcome it and beat the game. I thought the story was interesting and the graphics pretty good (though not near as good a current TR games). This DVD game pretty much takes all of the fun out of the game. I would rather just watch the gameplay than have to mess with the DVD commands. It's not fun. I never feel like I'm controlling Lara anyway. Entering in commands is just annoying.

One thing funny is that, although the game is played with perfection (meaning that jumps are never missed) you can still tell how bad the controls are and how Lara still controls like a truck.",1182816000,2,731,4.375
