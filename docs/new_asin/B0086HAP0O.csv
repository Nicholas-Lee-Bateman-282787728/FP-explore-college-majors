5135074,2,B0086HAP0O,"I only rented this to see Kevin Richardson. He was great in it! The movie itself I didn't care for. I didn't like the story line and most of the characters were very annoying and corny. The movie ended abruptly. I also hated the cinematography. It gave me a headache. For some reason, I thought this was going to be a comedy.",1422921600,,325,4.258064516129032
5135075,5,B0086HAP0O,"I stumbled upon this movie after reading a random Kevin Richardson interview (yeah I was a big Backstreet Boys fan) that discussed making this movie.  I decided to give it a try and rented the movie to watch with a friend.  Even though I knew the basic plot of the movie (I read IMDB and some reviews) I was still surprised and a bit disturbed when I watched the movie.

The plot of a simple food related gathering of neighboring couples spiraling out of control was unique and well done.  I loved the acting and the character development.  The ending was abrupt, but (in my opinion) fitting and I recommend this movie to anyone who is on the fence about watching it.",1397692800,,667,4.434426229508197
5135076,5,B0086HAP0O,"This isn't a bad movie, a little different, but still pretty good! What makes this movie great is the acting, and the setting! Also the plot twist will keep you going until the end!",1392163200,,181,4.352941176470588
5135077,4,B0086HAP0O,"Movie was ok. Acting was ok. Story was odd but expected. Ending was abrupt. Love the setting of the movie and costuming. Character development was good. Intended or not, this movie left me feeling a bit disturbed, and wanting... As mentioned earlier it ended a bit abruptly.",1365724800,,274,4.851063829787234
5135078,5,B0086HAP0O,"The Casserole Club by Steve Balderson is one dish you can't stop eating. You will savor each bite as if it were your last. What leads from a quaint get together of friends and neighbors, turns into an exploration of dark inner feelings and desires. Steve Balderson brings you into the lives of five couples: Sugar (Susan Traylor) and Conrad (Kevin Richardson), Kitty (Starina Johnson) and Sterling (Garrett Swann), Jerome (Daniela Sea) and Leslie (Mark Booker), Marybelle (Jennifer Grace) and Max (Michael Maize), and finally Florene (Pleasant Gehman) and Burt (Hunter Bodine).
Sugar (Traylor) suggests that the women make a casserole dish and bring it to a little get together and let their husbands judge who made the best dish. The winner gets a T-shirt that says ""Queen Casserole"". This is only the beginning of what lies beneath the happy exterior of these home makers. The Casserole Club starts off as a comedy but quickly changes directions into a drama from this point on.
After the first party turns into a wife swap, the women feel awkward and the men seem to move on. It was interesting to see how the two sexes deal with the situation of that night. You also start to discover the issues lying underneath each character. Everything from cutting, self-loathing and sadness, homosexuality to questioning ones own desires in love and marriage. The way people tend to deceive themselves to make their lives better.
Set to the backdrop of the 1969 moon landing, as well as some major moments in history, which I might add are placed well within the film to set the mood of the scenes. The music goes very well with the current mood of the scenes as well. Another theme in the movie are the colors. I have to say that Steve Balderson knows how to weave visuals and sound together like a master chef. His direction is on point with what he is trying to portray to the audience. The actors bring each character to life and make you feel sympathy for them. You become connected with the characters and their issues. You can actually say to yourself that you know someone like this.
Overall, The Casserole Club is an excellent film that serves up a tasty dish that will tantalize ones taste buds. I highly recommend this movie to join anyone's DVD library. It's one movie you can watch over and over again, only to discover something you missed the first time around.",1340582400,4,2369,4.72463768115942
8525881,4,B0086HAP0O,"We could see where this movie was headed after half an hour. It started off fun, but then you could see what would happen with the inappropriate, bored people. Noone sees that marriages and lives will be ruined, until it's too late. There was a tv show like this a few years ago, that was good. I think there were 7 episodes before it was cancelled. All of the neighbors put their keys in a basket and went home with their neighbor's wives. This movie reminds us of that tv show.",1529625600,,479,4.274725274725275
8525882,1,B0086HAP0O,"It sucked! It seen to be a low budget movie, with actors I never seen before.",1482710400,,77,3.875
8525883,3,B0086HAP0O,I'm not sure how I feel about this movie. I am a BIG Kevin Richardson fan from the Backstreet Boys days.. His acting was good in the movie but the movie itself did not really hold my attention. A good movie if you want something on for distraction but not worth the rental price.,1466553600,,279,4.185185185185185
8525884,1,B0086HAP0O,"SAY WHAT??  5 reviewers gave THIS show 5 stars???  with all due respect, those poor folks simply MUST get out more often.  the acting was awful, the story line was appalling, the camera work was amateurish, the wardrobe was pitiful, etc, etc, etc.  the ONLY good thing that can be said about his piece of work...  wait...  there IS nothing good to be said about this movie.  in conclusion, take my advise and take a pass on this one.",1451952000,,433,4.405063291139241
8525885,5,B0086HAP0O,"Like another reviewer, I think this is a cult classic. I will watch this again one day. The soundtrack alone is worth five stars!!!",1448668800,,131,4.5
8525886,4,B0086HAP0O,"If you only like the usual, run-of-the-mill type American movies, you probably won't like this movie. But if you enjoy independent films that tend to have more depth, then you might like this one.

I am impressed with Kevin Richardson's acting. I have never liked BSB music at all, but I have met Kevin. I was married to one of his relatives and spent enough time with him to know that he is definitely nothing like the character he portrays. He is a really nice person with, in my opinion, a great deal of humility. He is certainly not just playing himself, as many music celebrities do when they star in a film role.",1447718400,,618,4.421052631578948
8525887,1,B0086HAP0O,Didn't seem particularly funny or interesting so I watched something else instead.,1446422400,,82,5.916666666666667
8525888,4,B0086HAP0O,A cult film. Made to look like it was filmed in the 60's. A sort of soap opera drama but interesting in a quirky way.,1440115200,,117,3.72
8525889,1,B0086HAP0O,"This movie isn't even bad enough to be good. Backstreet Boy Kevin Richardson is good, he plays a character very unlike like himself and if you're over 18 (this isn't a family friendly movie) and a fan it's worth seeing once, the scene in the bathroom shows he can do some real acting. Other people get naked but not Kevin, his character has a better time with a cookie bar then he does with his wife. Otherwise this is a really boring movie full of characters not worth caring about. There are some nice pieces of Fiesta Ware.",1433980800,,526,4.377551020408164
