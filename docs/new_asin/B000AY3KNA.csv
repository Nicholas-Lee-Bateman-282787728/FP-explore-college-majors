2396692,4,B000AY3KNA,"Even though I always found SON OF KONG incredibly boring, my hats off to those great New York memories of Thanksgiving in the '70s and early '80s with WOR channel 9.  Once a year, every year, you could count on ""Ape Day"" every Thanksgiving as a kid when you were on vacation from school:

12pm - MIGHTY JOE YOUNG

 2pm - KING KONG

 4pm - SON OF KONG

Only flaw, though; my family would usually entertain the entire family, which meant my mother was constantly asking me to help her out before everyone arrived.  That meant constant interruptions and missing the good parts.  Remember, this was before the VCR!

I'll look forward to buying the KING KONG and MIGHTY JOE YOUNG DVDs.

Have to say, finally, that ""Godzilla"" day on the Friday after never meant that much to me.  Even as a kid, I was scratching my head trying to comprehend the out-of-synch English dubbing.",1129075200,9,868,4.529032258064516

2396699,5,B000AY3KNA,"Watching King Kong was an event as a kid. It was scary, exciting and sad. You would cheer the rescue efforts by Carl and crew for Ann, hypnotized by Skull Islands jungle and dinosaurs, cheer Kong on during his battles protecting Ann and finding yourself torn in the end for whom to cheer for. But I know we all felt for Kong.

I would flip through the TV guide to see when it would play again on the local channel and seemed forever for it to be run again on TV.

That was over 30 years ago, til this day and I'm sure anyone who has seen this movie, never ever gets tired of it....you're drawn to it. It's truely held it's viewers captive since 1933!

It's special effects are as good as some of the heavy CGI movie's presently out there!

I still get excited and feel like I did as a kid watching it today! What a Movie for the Centuries!

Can't wait for the upcoming DVD release! It's about time!",1124409600,12,898,4.167630057803469
2396700,5,B000AY3KNA,"If you grew up with New York City's WOR on your cable box, you have fine memories about their Thanksgiving Day marathon of King Kong, Son of Kong and Mighty Joe Young. It's was Big Apes that kept us on the sofa along with too much turkey. I so missed not being able to share that experience with my own family.  But now I can thanks to this wonderful DVD set - that comes out just before Thanksgiving.

I had a chance to see King Kong on the big screen a few times and it's still an amazing film. I don't care what they can do with CGI, Kong still comes alive on the screen.

If only Universal would put out King Kong Vs. Godzilla, the experience would be complete.

now for the big specs that you are wondering about on this set:

2396721,5,B000AY3KNA,"Packed with vigorous, chest-pounding energy and heart-tugging emotion, this giant ape trilogy delivers enough thrilling entertainment to satisfy the beast in all of us. With beautifully restored picture and sound, these timeless classics can be enjoyed together in all their glory in this fabulous DVD collection, which includes a treasure-trove of in-depth extra material.

First up is KING KONG. No, not the guy in the ape-suit from 1976 nor the CG toon from 2005, but the original, towering, cinematic landmark from 1933. No matter how efficient special effects become, this stop-motion monarch from Skull Island stands his ground and defies being dethroned by wimpy, remade imposters. A totally original concept by producer Merian C. Cooper and exceptionally directed by Cooper and his partner, Ernest B. Schoedsack, KING KONG tells the famous tale about reckless filmmaker Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), who sets out on an expedition to an uncharted island where he hopes to film his greatest production. Upon arriving things go awry when the natives kidnap leading lady Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) and offer her as a sacrifice to their god, a 50-foot ape called Kong. A rescue party led by first mate Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot) pursues Kong through the dinosaur infested jungle where many crew members are killed. Ann is rescued by Driscoll while Kong, who has become enamoured of his beautiful captive, follows them back to the native village which he rampages before being subdued by a gas-bomb. Kong is brought to New York in chains and put on exhibition only to break loose, wreak havoc and, with Ann in his grip, climb to the top of the Empire State Building where he meets his doom when attacked by fighter planes.

Special effects wizard Willis O'Brien created nothing short of a miracle in his realization of Kong, who was only an 18"" articulated puppet. Through the painstaking process of stop-motion animation, O'Brien gave Kong a distinctive personality that's nuanced in gesture and expression to such an uncanny degree, that it's almost as if there's a soul inside that bundle of steel, sponge rubber and rabbit fur. All of the effects have an organic, primeval quality that's never been duplicated. Adding immeasurably to the film's magic spell is Max Steiner's splendid music, which embellishes the story with a wide range of emotion and stands as one of the all-time greatest film scores. No less important are the sound effects by Murray Spivack which, given this was early in the sound era, are remarkably bold and cleverly overlaid. While KING KONG is justly praised for its technical innovations, the film's true genius lies in how all of that comes together to serve the brilliant, allegorical scenario about the destructive power of both civilization and unrequited love. Perfectly paced, wildly thrilling, and hauntingly moving, its mythical stature is still potent even after 80 years.

Following the awesome success of KING KONG, RKO rushed out a sequel later that same year, SON OF KONG, with Cooper and Schoedsack again at the helm. The story picks up with Denham, now broke and saddled with lawsuits, setting out once again for Skull Island in search of a treasure he hopes will cancel his debts. Upon arriving, Denham's party discovers Kong's albino offspring who, unlike his people-chomping parent, befriends them and comes to their aid in fending off more of the island's prehistoric inhabitants. The treasure is discovered, but an earthquake erupts and little Kong goes down with the island as Denham and company sail away.

Commencing with a tight budget and even tighter production schedule, the producers realized they'd never equal, let alone surpass the exceptional results of KING KONG. They compromised by making SON more comedic and sentimental in tone. Nevertheless, the sequel is still an enjoyable adventure with fine effects from Willis O'Brien and another excellent score by Max Steiner. Robert Armstrong reprises his role as Denham, who isn't as brash as before and clearly has remorse for his part in the tragic events of the previous film. He also gets romantically involved with Hilda, a stowaway, charmingly played by Helen Mack.

As in SON OF KONG, a friendly ape is the titular character in MIGHTY JOE YOUNG, which was released by RKO in 1949. Co-produced by Cooper and John Ford, and directed by Schoedsack, the scenario has Armstrong playing another showman type, Max O'Hara, who goes to Africa to round up some animals for his swanky new Hollywood night club. No sooner does he get there when he runs into a giant gorilla called Joe and its pretty young owner, Jill Young (Terry Moore). After some coercing, Jill and Joe go to Hollywood as the star attraction in O'Hara's club. They're a sensation until some rowdy drunks anger Joe, and the ape runs amok destroying the club and injuring many of the patrons. A court order for Joe's execution is issued, but when Joe rescues some children from a burning orphanage, the order is rescinded and Joe, Jill and her boyfriend Greg (Ben Johnson) return to Africa.

Newcomer Ray Harryhausen was assigned to assist O'Brien with the animation but ended up doing about 80% of the work himself. The results, while not as masterful as in KING KONG, are still pretty impressive. Sequences such as the cowboys roping Joe, his destruction of the night club, and the rescue at the orphanage are expertly staged and executed. Besides its technical merits, MIGHTY JOE YOUNG offers a well paced storyline with a happy ending for the big monkey this time around. It's to Cooper and Schoedsack's credit that they went for a lighter approach with their giant apes after the deeper KONG, in which the monster is a misunderstood anti-hero whom the audience ends up rooting for. This capacity for a fearsome character to inspire sympathy without resorting to overt sentimentality is what separates a masterpiece like KING KONG from lesser films like SON OF KONG and MIGHTY JOE YOUNG.

Certainly the crown jewel in this collection is KING KONG, but the other two titles are worthy companions that are entertaining in their own right. All three movies are exceedingly watchable, and I enthusiastically give this handsome boxed set my highest recommendation.

The King Kong dvd comes in an aluminum case(which bends easy, so watch out for that) inside is the 2 disk DVD on the first disk, you have the movie in very High Quality, with little film grain. Along with the trailers for some other Merrian C. Cooper movies. On the second disk you have two documentary's, one about the life of Cooper,and the other about the making of King Kong. It is in seven parts, and is one of the best documentary's i have ever seen. And of course we have Son of Kong, and Mighty Joe Young, not much to say about those. And included in the box sets are... Postcards! Yes, postcards with posters for King Kong on them. Overall this was a great purchase. Five stars.",1326499200,3,969,4.132275132275132

I Recommend this set!!!!! Note: since I am so hard of hearing I try not to buy any tv or movie dvd's without either Closed Captioning or Subtitles in English, which is one of the best things about buying dvds on Amazon is that most are labeled correctly about this and many other things you may like to know about a dvd. So far everything I've bought has one or the other (including this set) So thanks everyone!!!!",1325894400,4,740,4.21830985915493

2396745,5,B000AY3KNA,"I agree with the 3 reviewers which preceeded me - the film is excellent, it is restored and digitally remastered - marvelous. But I'm not here to talk about the movies; I came to talk about the bonus disc of the 2-disc King Kong, available in this 3-movie set as well as in the solo 2-disc version. It contains two bonus features: a documentary on the producer/director called ""I'm the King! The Exploits of Merian C. Cooper,"" (57') and ""RKO Productions 601: The Making of Kong, Eighth Wonder of the World,"" (159') a 7 part documentary about the making of King Kong. Cooper is a fascinating man, and I wish I'd owned this when my three kids were younger to share with them regarding an American hero. If your tastes go beyond Kong, stop-motion-animation, and Ray Harryhausen (which are all excellent), then enjoy these facts about Cooper:
-  was a WWI & II pilot (he and partner Schoedsack were the pilots who shot down Kong)
- was an explorer, adventurer, and documentarian
- was a founding director of Pan American Airways
- became head of production at RKO
- pioneer with David O. Selznick on technicolor (Cooper was at RKO under head Selznick, who later at Selznick studios made Gone With the Wind - according to GWTW featurettes, Selznick burned down the Kong island village gates set for the burning of Atlanta)
- early pioneer of Cinerama (remember How the West Was Won?)
- attached to the Flying Tigers in WWII
- was invited in 1945 to the Japanese surrender on the USS Missouri
- calloborated with John Ford and John Wayne (look for the patriotic reason why)

This are fascinating history about the man, his movies, RKO, the film industry, and, oh yeah, let's not forget the big guy himself - Kong.

Additional findings:
- Ray Harryhausen joined the Cooper team of Schoedsack, Ruth Rose, O'Brien, John Ford, and Robert Armstrong for the making of Mighty Joe Young (go Ray!)
- Fay Wray made 10 films in 1932 in addition to King Kong, one of which was Cooper's The Most Dangerous Game, sharing the same Kong island sets (often same days of filming).
- Excellent featurettes on Willis O'Brien and stop-motion-animation.
- King Kong score by Max Steiner, who also did, or contributed to, Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane, and Cassablanca (jeesh!)
- The lost spider pit scsequence is not O'Brien's footage; it is Peter Jackson's recreation of what he thinks the original ""might"" have looked like. This is OK for what it is, but don't get your hopes up that they are original.

The bonus features are a fine addition to your Cooper, O'Brien, Fay Wray, and Harryhausen collection.",1243728000,16,2582,4.70575221238938

2396747,5,B000AY3KNA,"I am a huge fan of stop motion effects and what better example of this process than King Kong! Harryhausen would take over as king of Stop Motion, but without Kong, there would be no Harryhausen! This is one of my favorite movies of all time and the DVD is nothing short of spectacular! Not being old enough to have seen this iconic film in a theater, I was finally able to watch this film in my home theater on a 10 foot screen! As the movie began I was amazed how clear the print was and I noticed little things I had never saw before. This is pretty amazing considering I've seen this film over 100 times. The sound is still mono, but it's clear and it's would be hard to really improve on this. The film holds up amazingly well and is the definitive giant monster movie!

The second disc in loaded with wonderful bonus features including two long and interesting documentaries. I bought the box set which includes the original Mighty Joe Young and Son of Kong on separate disc, which are sold separately for those who only want certain films in this set. All three films are great examples of Stop Motion so it's a great set for fans of this stuff. The set includes the same 2 disc special edition of King Kong and two other classic stop motion films! All the films have been re-mastered and look better than ever!",1173225600,6,1318,4.357723577235772
2396748,5,B000AY3KNA,"Finally available in a beautiful restored and remastered transfer from the best available elements, KING KONG, the single most requested title for DVD, is part of three title THE KING KONG COLLECTION).  Besides the two-disc King Kong, there's Son of Kong and Mighty Joe Young.

Kong co-writer/producer/director Merian C. Cooper's real life was a blue print for fictional big ape filmmaker Carl Denham.  One of the features on the superb two-disc King Kong is a new TCM documentary on the legendary Kong creator Cooper.  Adventurer, war hero, explorer, pilot, filmmaker and cinema-innovator, the daring and honorable Cooper survived multiple wartime plane crashes, was declared dead on two occasions and even pulled off a daring escape after being held prisoner for ten months in a Russian POW camp.

The other great extra is a new, extraordinary seven-part, two hour and 40 minute documentary on the making of Kong.

However you look at it, King Kong must be included among the most influential of American films.

This beautifully executed original tale is a monster movie, a fantasy, an adventure, a love story, a tragedy and an unparalleled thriller.  Loaded with striking imagery, the innovative 1933 effects still have power to suspend disbelief.  The film, packed with meaning, is religious, mythological, Jungian and insanely Freudian.

The restored print has the look of a fine Dor engraving.  King Kong is a must have and perfect appetizer for Peter Jackson's overwrought, but stunning remake.",1158624000,5,1502,5.2426778242677825

2396753,5,B000AY3KNA,"My review is my love for the Movie

I have been a KING KONG fan since 1960 As a young boy I looked at the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING from my MOM and DAD'S bedroom window. One of my older Brothers intorduced me to the KING KONG movie of 1933. It was on a TV program called THE MILLION DOLLAR MOVIE, WOR TV Channel 9 in New York City. It played the whole week when it was aired. Every evening the movie would be on TV at either 8 or 9 PM. I would try to watch it as much as possible the week it was on. With a big family, and being the youngest that was very hard. Especially when we only had one TV in the apartment. Then years later, KING KONG, SON OF KONG, and MIGHTY JOE YOUNG would be aired on TV THANKSGIVING DAY. I looked forward to this every year. Then that stopped. Every once in a while I would catch the Movie here and there. After I bought my first VCR, I managed to tape all three Movies. Now I had a copy of my own. I made on more copy of 1933 KING KONG, in Color. It was on AMC American Movie Classics. The color version is the best of all. The color is much clearer for some reason, the contrast of the film is much better. The DVD's are excellent for Black and White Movies.

2396754,4,B000AY3KNA,"This is a nice set, although the new version of the original King Kong is by far the best of the three movies. Even on a cheap tv, the movie looks and sounds good. I'm not a big fan of commentaries, so won't talk much about that, but I am a big fan of old movies, classic or not. When I watched King Kong this time, it was probably about the 10th time, but never had I seen some of the scenes. Of course the special effects are lame, but overall, the set was well worth the price.",1138665600,3,480,3.9081632653061225
2396755,5,B000AY3KNA,"We love Kong, and so does everyone involved in the production of this fine boxed set. The transfer and restoration of King Kong is, frankly, a revelation to behold, and the documentaries are eye-opening in their content (and their fanatical completness). This box set seems like the best value of all the Kong variations available, because I'd rather have the ""sequels"" Son of Kong and Mighty Joe Young than a bunch of poster reproductions in a tin can. It's the movies that matter most.

Bracket this set with The Lost World (1925) and The Black Scorpion (1957) and you'll have the essential Willis H. O'Brien collection for endless antideluvian thrills.",1137369600,3,655,4.954545454545454
2396756,4,B000AY3KNA,"I was torn between purchasing the 3 pack including Joe Young and Son of Kong or the Collector Edition King Kong.  It wasn't until after watching the Mighty Joe Young that I realized I made the right decision.  My son and I (17 years old) watched in awe at the animation techniques utilized to depict Joe Young, dare I say - going ape - in Denhams night club, throwing lions around etc.  The night clubs were pretty cool back then too.  Thought the movie was going to be too hockey, but it was actually allot of fun to watch especially Joe running from the cops at the end.  They knew how to have fun back then without all the political correctness and Wacko environmental and animal rights groups taking extreme positions which would obviously prevent the wit and humor in this movie from reaching the silver screen today",1137283200,5,821,4.52027027027027
2396757,5,B000AY3KNA,"Ray Harryhausen never forgot the first time he saw the original ""King Kong."" ""I haven't been the same since,"" the special effects wizard of ""Jason and the Argonauts"" and ""Mysterious Island"" says. ""That shows how a film can change a whole life sometimes."" Harryhausen figures he's watched the 1933 classic something like 175 times -- ""You see something different in it every time you run it."" For his 176th screening, DVD viewers are invited to listen in.

On the DVD debut of ""King Kong,"" Harryhausen and younger colleague Ken Ralston (""The Polar Express"") spin a relaxed and often delightful commentary. At times they're experts dissecting the groundbreaking effects work; then they just seem like youngsters awed by the giant ape's sound and fury. The restored ""King Kong"" contains the 4 1/2 minutes that were censored as too risque or violent -- scenes such as the one in which Kong tears away some of Faye Wray's clothes. Or his size-98 foot doing the monster mash on an islander.

The main nitrate print used for the restoration and transfer came from Britain, where ""Kong"" apparently roamed unmolested. The black-and-white images look sensational coming from a film that's almost 75 years old. The mono sound delivers the roars, screams and pounding drums without age-related distortion. The ""Kong"" DVD, with its generous suite of bonus features, completes a circle of sorts -- Criterion's laserdisc of 1985 was one of the first videos to include commentary and onscreen extras.

The highlight, aside from the still potent 1933 film, is a chronicle of Peter Jackson's reconstruction of legendary lost ""spider pit"" sequence -- the missing link in the ""Kong"" tale. Unlike other fans, he was in the position to resurrect it -- which the director did as a side project, ""purely for fun,"" as he started production on the new ""Kong."" The set's docu ""RKO Production 601: The Making of Kong, Eighth Wonder of the World,"" is well worth the time investment.",1136505600,7,1953,4.984662576687117
2396758,5,B000AY3KNA,"This is the movie that made our modern movies what they are, without it I can't imagine what we'd be watching on the big screen. It was so innovative for it's time I'm still blown away by it.

From visuals to sound and music, this movie invented alot of what we still use today, top that off with a great story and bam, you have one of the best all time movies ever.

I saw this movie for the first time about a month ago (at least the  whole way through, as a little kid I saw the t-rex fight) and even after watching CGI heavy blockbusters and big special effect movies Kong still blew me away. I just couldn't tell how things were done, everything meshes so well together.

If you haven't seen Kong, or you just haven't seen it in a LONG time, buy this set, not only do you get the original King Kong, you get TONS of bonus material on the director and how the movie was actually made. Plus you get Son of Kong (blah) and Mighty Joe Young (good movie).

Whats funny is this movie blows the first remake out of the water, the 76 version is so HORRIBLE in everyway it's laughable at best. Peter Jacksons remake though...a MUST see, great, great movie, on of this years best.",1135296000,4,1175,4.204444444444444
2396759,5,B000AY3KNA,"This set's a great buy with the original 1933 ""King Kong"" being the stand-out.  Kong looks and sounds great especially for a film of that vintage whose original negative has been long lost.  There's detail and clarity to the images that I've never seen before--check out the introduction to the island natives and the kong skulls carved into the decor.

The extras on the DVD are numerous and mind blowing!  My favorite extra is a lost sequence recreated in black and white by director Peter Jackson.  It's a fantastic treat that makes the DVD worth owning just for this.

""King Kong"" stands as one of the greatest adventure films in  history.

The sequel ""Son of Kong"" is not comparable to the original, but it's short and zippy and little Kong is adorable and beautifully animated.  The DVD image and sound is even better than that of ""King Kong"".  A trailer is the only extra.

""Might Joe Young"" is a favorite from my childhood.  It's got some truly ingenious sequences especially the amazing orphanage finale.  The DVD image is the best of the set--pristine and gorgeous.  The disc has a trailer, a good featurette and a fine commentary by Ray Harryhausen as well.",1134950400,18,1168,4.717821782178218
2396760,5,B000AY3KNA,"What can I say about King Kong?  I've seen it over 300 times, and I've been waiting for the DVD since the day I bought the first of my 1,200-title collection.  Loved the MCCooper documentary.  The other 7-part documentary, however...an hour about Kong and an hour of Peter Jackson spouting?  Sheesh.  It's a sad commentary that this ALL-TIME CLASSIC was released only because some upstart filmed a remake.  All that was missing was an interview with Dino DeLaurentiis and Jessica Lange...",1134864000,7,488,4.962962962962963
2396771,4,B000AY3KNA,"Received my Kong package and for the most part love it. The best part for me were the making of Kong and the Merian Cooper Biography. I never realized what and amazing life he had, someone in Hollywood should seriously consider making a movie about his life. As far as the films themselves are concerned, the digital transfer of Son of Kong and Mighty Joe Young were great and look great on my wide screen TV, the digital transfer of King Kong was not as good. The pitcher is bright but grainy, maybe because all the re-releases to theaters of this film. I agree with an earlier reviewer as to why the colorized version was not included. I watched the colorized VHS right after viewing the new DVD version and the colorized VHS is much superior to the DVD. I don't care what the purest say about colorized movies, some films were ment to be made in color and King Kong is one of them. The Jungle scenes and Kong's battles with the T-Rex and other creatures really come to life in color. Hopefully the color version will be transfered to DVD soon, otherwise I did enjoy this box set.",1134345600,6,1082,4.415
2396772,5,B000AY3KNA,"I just finished watching KING KONG, SON OF KONG and MIGHTY JOE YOUNG w/ my 9yo son. While KING KONG is my personal favorite of this collection, my son and I loved watching SON and JOE together. This set is perfect for anyone who enjoys stop-motion and lots of monsters! Everyone knows that KING KONG is one of the greatest movies of all time. The tale of a titanic 30' tall gorilla that is no match for modern man's greed and commercialism is a true masterpiece. Faye Wray (The Most Dangerous Game, Doctor X, The Vampire Bat) is beautiful and vulnerable as Ann Darrow. Robert Armstrong (Son Of Kong, Mighty Joe Young, The Most Dangerous Game) plays the bombastic Dehnam w/ pompous glee. Kong's battles w/ various dinosaurs (as well as his son's fights w/ more big lizards in the sequel) are popcorn-munching classics! SON OF KONG has Dehnam returning to the island where it all began. He meets up w/ Kong's offspring and gets a shot at redemption for the shameful treatment of Kong senior. MIGHTY JOE YOUNG is a sentimental story similar to Kong in it's portrayal of the ""beast"" as a sympathetic character taken from it's home, only to be thrown into an alien world of exploitation and death. This triple feature is a must for any / all horror / monster maniacs! Highest recommendation...",1133913600,9,1288,4.6535087719298245
2396773,4,B000AY3KNA,"This is an interesting combination of Merian C.Cooper and Willis O'Brien collaborations. First as I have stated else where KING KONG is a Great Movie in any of the current versions. I have some  problems in the inclusion of the ""Mighty Joe Young"" I would have preferred ""Most Dangerous Game"". Others will insist it is the Giant ""APE"" theme and it is true Willis O'Brien was a little busy at the time of ""Most Dangerous Game"" filming.

Now to KING KONG the film appears to me to be identical to the earlier 60 Anniversary Laser Disc although run time is listed as 4 minutes longer. I must say I found the commentary track by Ray Harryhausen and Ken Ralston annoying, sounding as informative as an episode Mystery Science Theater. (Sorry Ray)The commentary done for Criterion Laser Disc by Ronald Haver superior in every way. The Audio is MONO and not the Stereo of the earlier 60th Anniversary Laser Disc. The follow on documentaries are well worth watching. The ""I'm King Kong"" profile of Cooper is great while The Making of... seemed a bit disapointing too many talking heads to many flashing cuts. It is still very good and loaded with information. I do have mixed feelings on the RECREATION of the ""Lost Spider Pit Sequence"". The value of including  a second ""dupilcate clip"" on the disc of the Lost ""Spider Pit"" Sequence is questionable.  The Creation Clip and commentary by Ray Harryhausen is excellent. MISSING IS ""Turners"" COLORISED Version of King Kong.

As to the ""Three"" Different Warner 2 Disc packages released it a matter of preference The versions differ only in packaging a some novelty items the Discs themselves appear to have the same content. So in short it is very hit and miss. This release is ""good"" but ""not definitive""! This release is clearly more about Cooper than Willis O'Brien.
P.S.
If someone would like to see what the Willis O'Brien's ""Lost Spider Pit Sequence"" would of looked like. I recommend you view
O'Brien's 1957 ""Black Scorpion"".

The Second Title Son of Kong is a personal favorite. I believe Ruth Rose and Cooper likly reworked the orginal ""Creation"" Script
I think this will be apparent if you view ""The Making Of ..."" segment on ""Creation"". I guess it is the character development in Son of Kong that I enjoy. Robert Armstrong for instants becomes the ""HERO"". Helen Mack the female lead has an opportunity to do more then ""scream"" and repeat lines. May be it is the ""Rag Man""!
Most will remark that Willis O'Briens work is not up to the mark  set by ""King Kong"" and I agree. Clearly they had ""no"" budget and even less time.  Still ""Little Kong"" has his moments and is believable as a real character. Frankly with the exception Styracosaurus and the Bear many other special effects look like ""King Kong"" rejects. In short ""Son of Kong"" works despite all of its short comings.

The Third title ""The Mighty Joe Young"" and is definitely not a ""Son of Kong"". I consider this most juvenile of the three outings. I also see it, as more of a Ray Harryhausen film than Willis O'Brien's. And oddly I have never really liked the premise or found the characters particularly likable. Still it must be said the special effects are first rate and almost seamless in transitions to real life.

As a set this is an excellent value all three are from good source materail.",1133827200,7,3299,4.682210708117444
2396774,5,B000AY3KNA,"What a joy to soak myself in the great 1933 classic. Soaked in the special effects (great even today) and with Max Steiner's score (first time I really noticed. Always loved Godzilla more; held Kong as the monster Legend that all subsquent giant kaiju tip their hats to. (After all without Kong there would be no Godzilla, no dispute there) Kong is an Icon in the scope of Elvis, Marilyn, Frankenstein. So as a Godzilla fan first Kong is Legend.

1. Love the spider pit sequence. Scary scary scary.

2. Didn't like the part where Kong dumps the girl to the sidewalk. Super violent then super violent now. After that three words pop up; Kong must die.

3. Biggest rant of all. ALL HARRYHAUSEN FILMS ARE CRAP COMPARED TO A 1933 MOVIE. I've never been impressed by Harry-hosehead. Why? Except for Jason and the Argonauts all his ""flicks"" look like superimposed monsters over stock city footage. Too ""crisp"". I heard Harryhausen is/was bitter over the popularity of Godzilla. Too bad. Maybe because people like guys=in=suits that aren't supposed to look real and the city battlescapes look like someone took time to make them look somewhat real. Master O'Brien may out-do Maestro Tsuburaya but Harryhausen comes up short against both. SUPER HIGH FIVE FOR KONG 1933, MUTE FOR HARRYHAUSEN. And Mighty Joe Young doesn't warrent my interest. If anyone wants to back up Harry, I'll read it.",1133568000,4,1381,4.843220338983051

It doesn't get any better than this. The downside was that I drove all over town (Portland, OR. metro area) trying to find a copy of the Kong set on the day of release, and no one had it....some store clerks never knew there was a King Kong film from the 1930's! I strolled into Suncoast Video, and saw some on the shelves, but they were all on reserve. The clerk there was nice enough to ring up Sam Goody in that same mall and they had just one copy. And yes people, I know I could've ordered it off Amazon but I just didn't want to wait any longer! : ) For those members of the attention deficit set running out to get a copy of ""Stealth""...which of course you can get anywhere...forget that purchase, and pick up this set for some real action.",1132617600,9,921,4.209039548022599
2396778,4,B000AY3KNA,"comments from Roger Ebert:

""The visual techniques are explained by film historian Ron Haver, whose commentary track on the 1985 Criterion laser disc was one of the first ever recorded. He is amusing in describing how some live-action scenes were miniaturized to make the Kong model look larger; searching for the right screen to project them on, the filmmakers hit on a screen made of condoms, to the consternation of a nearby druggist who could not understand their orders for a gross at a time. Haver also observes how Kong's fur seems to crawl during several scenes; the model was covered with rabbit fur, and the fingers of the stop-action animators disturbed it between every stop-action shot. The effect, explained by the filmmakers as ""muscles rippling,"" is oddly effective. (When a DVD of ""King Kong"" is finally issued, Turner Pictures would be wise to recycle the Haver commentary.)""

2396779,5,B000AY3KNA,"In 1970 and 1971 I was in the US Army stationed in the Panama Canal Zone. The Army had a string of theaters in the CZ which showed both current films and a selection of older films, all of them in 35mm and most of them subtitled in Spanish. This was where I first saw THE SEA HAWK, TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE and many other four star classics in 35mm. I went to see the unrestored King Kong print they played one week and I was shocked and amazed by the HUGE subtitles centered in the middle of the picture! A half year or so later and they had King Kong again, this time it was the version with the newly - discovered censored scenes restored...and no subtitles. The quality was stunning and I clearly recall that the aluring Miss Wray was very plainly not wearing a bra under her costume. I am very pleased that Warner Bros Video is releasing this triple feature on DVD - I feel they do the best all around job with film-to-DVD transfers.",1129939200,14,942,4.238888888888889

As for the supplemental materials, most of us are familiar with the people involved in creating them, and we also know the historical importance of much of the material that's being offered on this set. Even if Cooper's unseen test footage from Creation is lousy, it's going to be a treat to see it, and that's what we're reviewing. With two GREAT movies, one so-so but fun movie and lots of bonus materials in this set, how could anyone who loves KONG not give up the high ratings? I mean, do you think Ray Harryhausen is going to be BORING?  Do you think when Peter Jackson's working on documentary material about the movie that had the biggest influence on his career, it's going to be a snoozer?
