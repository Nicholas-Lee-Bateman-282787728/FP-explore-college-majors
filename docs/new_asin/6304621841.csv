909588,5,6304621841,"It's been 10 years ago since they brought Pippi Longstocking to life in the world of animation. I first saw this when I was 14, and I've already loved her ever since then. I've also read her books. Astrid Lindgren is an excellent author.

You may not know this, but there is also an animated TV series of Pippi Longstocking as well. Since Pippi was brought to animation 10 years ago, there should be a 10th anniversary special edition DVD of the movie which includes extras such as behind-the-scenes looks of how they brought Pippi into animation, interviews with some of the cast members, and even an audio commentary, among other features. They should also release Pippi's complete animated series on DVD in the United States as well. I had no idea at all her animated adventures were produced in Canada! I like the animated Pippi better than the live-action one.

Whatever happens, and if they ever decide to update the movie on DVD, I'll still love Pippi.
PIPPI LONGSTOCKING IS #1!!! ... for me, at least.",1196294400,,1009,4.694915254237288
909589,4,6304621841,"My daughter has been a Pippi fan ever since I introduced it to her at the age of 12 months.  Now 2 years old, she loves this animated version, but perfers the one of the 90s with Tami Erin.  She likes the songs in this one, and I don't think they are so bad.  It took me a while to get used to them though!  This isn't like the original Pippi that we all know and love so well, but it is a cute, modern, animation to the beloved classic.",1195084800,2,437,3.8222222222222224
909590,5,6304621841,I've watched Pippi Longstocking (Animation) since I was seven years old.  And recently I've misplaced the VHS video.  I couldn't help myself but to buy it again! Its a great movie! Fun to watch! Makes me laugh and want pancakes! :],1190160000,2,231,4.609756097560975
909591,5,6304621841,"A great story about a strong, creative girl and the non-stop adventures she comes up. Very positive, very fun for kids. My kids (2 and 5) love it.",1185235200,,146,4.25
909592,5,6304621841,"These four exciting adventures from Canada's animated series of everyone's favorite Swedish red head, Pippi Longstocking, are sure to make you laugh. After watching each of Pippi's stories, I couldn't help but marval at what she can do. If ever someone wants to sell a house where a little girl resides in or wants to steal a chest of gold, it's Pippi Longstocking to the rescue! You can count on Pippi to save the day in each of her rim-tickling adventures.
Here's what happens in each episode on this DVD:

Pippi Returns to Villa Villakula: After sailing on the ocean for quite some time, Pippi Longstocking returns to her home, Villa Villakula. She lives all alone with nobody but her horse named... uh, well, Horse and her monkey named Mr. Nilson. In the town, she makes two new friends who live next door. Their names are Tommy and Annika. They tell Pippi that their lives are boring ... that is until Pippi makes no end of trouble in the town. Tommy and Annika couldn't help but get awestruck when Pippi lifts up Bengt the bully high in the air with her super human strenth and tosses him up a tree. Also, you couldn't stop wondering how Pippi can fill a sail on a ship with just one breath and how she can climb up a house onto the ruth. The little town, thanks to Pippi, will never be the same again with her around!

Pippi Doesn't Sell Her House: A man wants to buy Villa Villakula, and Tommy and Annika get somewhat shocked. But you bet that Pippi is ready to take on the action and halt the sale. The two thieves, Thunder Karlson and his assistant Bloom, decide to become real estate agents so they can sell Pippi's house and steal her chest of gold. Unfortunately, everyone's plans get backfired by Pippi's antics and they all get arrested. Also, you'll discover that Pippi has a difficult time trying to write when she invites Tommy and Annika for a tree party - a tea party in a hollow tree in Pippi's garden.

Pippi Meets a Master Criminal: After Thunder Karlson and Bloom look into a book on how to become a master criminal, they decide to carry out a crime and steal Pippi's gold. However, Pippi and her eccentric habits become obstacles while they try to commit that crime. First, Pippi tells a ghost story to the burglars which becomes too creepy that it scared them. Next, they write a letter begging Pippi to rescue them. Unfortunately, neither Pippi nor the other people in the town could figure out what they wrote. Their writing was as bad as Pippi's, or maybe worse. Finally, Pippi and the thieves play hide-and-seek. As the game went on, Thunder Karlson tries to sneak out with the money, but he and Bloom end up being found. In the end, the thieves end up stealing a chest of coconuts instead of Pippi's money.

Pippi Saves the Old Folks: When the Old Folks Home was going to be torn down and they have to move to a more uglier place, it's Pippi to the rescue! She proves to everybody that you can save an old person's home by standing up to the counsel. Also as the old building begins tumbling down, she manages to save the lives of the Chairman's children.

My favorite episode of all from this DVD was the one where Pippi meets the thieves - the third one. She was so funny! In fact, all the stories will make you laugh all the way through. If you just can't get enough of Pippi's adventures, I also recommend these titles you should try: Captain Longstocking and Pippi Longstocking's - Pippi Goes to the Fair. Be sure to read my reviews on those titles. I hope to get feedback on them after you watch them.

Those 3 DVD's contain only a few of Pippi's adventures and they were also released in Canada. If ever Nelvana Limited - the company that brought Pippi Longstocking to life on the TV screen - makes an agreement with Shout Factory, Image Entertainment, or whatever Home Entertainment company in the United States to release her adventures here, I hope they'll release the COMPLETE animated series. That's right! All 26 episodes from the animated Pippi series should come out in a DVD box set some time in the future. That way, we can watch all of her adventures straight through. Her television series is like a continuing chapter book on the screen.

909593,1,6304621841,"I didn't think it was possible to take the magic out of Pippi Longstocking, but this movie succeeds in spades.  The songs are cringe-worthy, the story is choppy, and Pippi just isn't Pippi.

Read the book to your kid instead.",1138320000,,225,4.6
909594,5,6304621841,"Pippi is such a delightful character when it comes to the animated version. My son, though is an adult, loves her adventures and shares it with some of his family.

I think that young or old, Pippi is to be enjoyed by everybody who has ever gotten to know her.",1105660800,,260,4.2
909595,4,6304621841,"Chances are you've heard of Pippi Longstocking.  The little red-haired girl that makes a habit of tossing around livestock, drawing on floors, washing the floor with her feet and so forth...  Is this movie an accurate representation of her character?  Is it even fun to watch?
The answer?  To some degree.
The movie suffers from having too many songs, but many of them are frenetic enough to be easy to get used to and even like, though there are a couple of unlikable ones, I found the sound to be in general, good.
My main problem with this movie is that it tamed the story for some reason.  Most of Pippi's wild stories are completely gone, and she no longer manhandles anyone who isn't a farm animal.  The characters themselves often change on the spur of the moment to accomidate this.  Even the fight at the circus (one of my favorite parts in the book,) became a tamer weight-lifting contest.
However, unlike the live version, the general attitude of Pippi is mostly similar to the one she had in the book, except perhaps that she's slightly less arrogant and lies a LOT less.  This certainly gives it the edge it needs to be superior to the live-action movie, which trampled all over the character of the girl wonder.
There's only one scene in the movie that disturbed me a little, and that was near the end, where Prissilious tries to grab Pippi and she actually looks scared.  That's not like Pippi at all.
But still, that's a fairly small thing, and if you MUST see Pippi on your TV screen (and I can't imagine why that would be,) this is the place to do it.
However, you're still far better off getting to know the REAL character of Pippi by reading the books, if you happen to have the time and literacy.",1080604800,12,1717,4.477564102564102

7875626,5,6304621841,"From the children's books by Astrid Lindgren comes this cartoon movie of Pippi Longstocking from 1997. Pippi Longstocking is a happy, free-spirited girl with a love for life and traveling. After a storm at sea separates Pippi from her dad, she has to live at her home on land, hopefully waiting for his return. And in the meantime, she has her own adventures around the neighborhood. I remember watching this movie 20 years ago in my youth and it still has all of its charm. Good songs, funny characters, and an overall fun and positive nature about it that children can enjoy for years to come. I would recommend getting this on VHS or DVD, however, it seems more expensive and rare to find nowadays. So it may be best to watch it somewhere online until there's a re-release again someday. Also, be sure to check out the TV series that came out after this movie. It's great as well.",1488326400,,883,4.525
