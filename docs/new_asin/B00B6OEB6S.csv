5559818,3,B00B6OEB6S,"This is a lackluster drama with several twists and unexplained plot gaps. The acting is strong, if only the actor's had a more coherent script. Worth watching if you know the Jersey Shore or enjoy James Ghandolfino (?) .",1368144000,,220,4.666666666666667
5559819,3,B00B6OEB6S,"The characters and their interaction was good.  I am from New Jersey so that the locations and language hit home.  The ending did not make sense, but I will not give the plot away in explanation.  It could have used about 15 minutes more to show how each character ended up.",1367366400,,274,4.333333333333333
5559820,2,B00B6OEB6S,"Not a bad movie... at least I understand what they were trying to do, but it falls short.  For instance, in one scene two guys are talking about their 40 year friendship and how important they are to each other - then, in the next scene - they hate each other.  Simply not believable... and the ending didn't make any sense at all.",1366502400,,331,4.238095238095238
5559821,3,B00B6OEB6S,"This small indie movie is well-observed, and credibly acted.  One's oldest friends need not be one's best friends, or so this movie would have you believe.",1366243200,,155,4.961538461538462
5559822,5,B00B6OEB6S,"DOWN THE SHORE is one of those little sensitive films that seems like it is lightweight until the secrets of the story begin to leak. It is a film about thwarted human relations that have a core of ill-define tragic misconceptions. It is well written (by Sandra Jennings), well directed  (by Harold Guskin) and happens to provide a showcase for some inordinately gifted actors who usually are not given the attention they deserve.

The film opens in Paris where a handsome Jacques (the very impressive Italian actor Edoardo Costa) is cranking a carousel for children in a little park. Observing him is a winsome Susan (Maria Dizzia) who speaks no French but in a rare moment of instant chemical gaze we can see that she and Jacques connect. Susan hires Jacques to be her guide while she is in Paris - and then we see them no more. The scene changes to 3 months later when Jacques comes to Susan's home in New Jersey, meets her brother Bailey (a brilliant role for James Gandolfini), informs Bailey that Susan is dead, and gives Bailey a letter and Susan's ashes and informs Bailey that he and Susan were married in France: the letter confirms that Jacques is to own half of Susan's house which she shared with Bailey and Jacques suggests he and Bailey be partners.  Bailey runs a small carnival park on the Jersey shore and Jacques is able to help him bring life back into the children's rides.

The other part of the story concerns Mary (Famke Janssen in excellent form) who is Bailey's childhood sweetheart but now married to Bailey's best friend, the covertly abusive crack addict Wiley (Joe Pope) who happens to own the little carnival park where Bailey works. Some talk between the two men suggests that their fathers were bad men but Wiley inherited his father's wealth and park and married Mary with whom he had a mentally challenged son Martin (John Magaro) while Bailey has remained single living with his sister Susan. The secrets of why Wiley is addicted to crack and physically abuses Mary while Bailey seems to do nothing about the woman he still loves is brought into focus by the wise Jacques, the one person who seems to be adjusted and happy despite his wife's recent death from cancer. In talks with both Bailey and Wiley, Jacques uncovers the horrid secrets that have bruised everyone's lives and what those secrets mean, and how the story works out must be withheld until the viewer experiences this film.

A stronger cast could not be imagined for this well written, well-directed film. The degree of identification with absolutely every character in the film is truly remarkable. This is a tale of the maladaptation to secrets of the past. And one of the many beauties of the film is the manner in which much is left unresolved or unsaid at the end.

5559823,4,B00B6OEB6S,"This small independent film puts Sopranos' star James Gandolfini back in northern New Jersey in a small seaside resort town (which is never identified by name.) This time he is not a gangster but a single guy, who once had a high school sweetheart (the girl who, literally, lived next door) but she married one of his ""best friends"". He now runs the train ride in the small amusement park owned by that ""friend"". When his sister goes off to Paris and doesn't come back he is forlorn until a man from France comes to visit him and ends up changing his life forever. To tell you any more would spoil the surprises and drama that seep out slowing in the 93 minute film. Gandolfini gets a lot of screen time and his range of emotions is well chosen. The rest of the cast is excellent two including actress Famke Janssen (X-men) as the former girlfriend, now the mother of a developmentally disabled teenager.
I'm sure this film played very few theaters but it's the kind of film that's great to discover on home video. No  Oscars here but a story that will keep you interested.
It's interesting that even the Bluray version - which really didn't appear to be very HD - has no extra features or bonuses - not even the trailer. There are both English and Spanish subtitles.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5559830,5,B00B6OEB6S,This was an excellent movie.  It should have gotten more press when it came out.  James Gandolfini was perfect as usual,1427846400,,119,4.619047619047619
5559831,5,B00B6OEB6S,"I am totally captivated by this film, if you are or were a resident of the Jersey shore or a fan of the late Mr. Gandolfini, it is a must. Good storyline and although it is not a mystery  it does not reveal; the shadows and substance easily.  With much . sympathy for the characters.;  it  is actually, a quiet slow moving film, but has enough drama and plot twists to hold your attention. I found that it is not a movie one can watch while multitasking, you must listen and watch for every scene is rich in meaning. Unfortunately, it is a much underrated film!  I liked it immensely so I rate it quite highly",1427328000,2,609,4.2155172413793105
5559832,5,B00B6OEB6S,"Golden Globe Winner and Actor of the ""Sopranos"" James Gandolfini provides a poignant account of how life can unfold and becomes unraveled when a dark secret begins to unfold.  James plays Bailey who's sister disappears to parts unknown and leaves with a stash of cash and instead of her returning enters her French husband, Edoardo Costa.  James who owns a kiddie amusement park is taken aback when his sister's husband comes and informs Bailey that his sister has died and has willed him several things including half the house that she and Bailey owns.

On the other hand Bailey has a next door neighbor, best friend and former lover played by Famke Janssen who marries his best friend. He is torn between the relationship between both of his best friends because he sees the conflicts arising between them but tries to be neutral in his interaction with them and keep his personal emotions out of it.  Additionally, Bailey is surprised that his sister's husband knows more about his sister than he realized that he does. She reveals a lot of secrets to her husband which her husband begins to inform Bailey about.

With Edoardo around secrets are exposed, truths are told and things begins to unravel as to what has been hidden for so long.  Will Bailey become unglued? Will Bailey begin to believe that Edoardo was truly his sister's husband? Will his relationship with his two best friends change?  Pick up a copy to find out.",1425686400,,1431,4.769230769230769

5559834,4,B00B6OEB6S,"This movie is kind of dark, the story develops slowly, but it held me. The acting is good and when all is said and done, it comes together into a nice movie. It reflects a blend of cultures, and contains a good deal of mystery. If you can tolerate the slow development and progress, it is worth watching,",1418947200,3,304,4.258620689655173

5559839,5,B00B6OEB6S,I met James Gandolfini while filming this movie in Keansburg..  He was very cordial.  I recognize a lot of the places where this movie was filmed.,1402099200,,146,4.576923076923077
5559840,2,B00B6OEB6S,"I suppose ever since the television series The Sopranos (in which the lead actor here, James Golfdofini, played a huge role), the reality show Jersey Housewives, and the devastation caused a couple of years ago by Hurricane Sandy Jersey and the Jersey shore that place south of New York City (and populated by many denizens of that city fleeing the hazards and high costs) are up for grabs in the cinematic department. I will not speak of other Jersey connections like the political situation there of late or of Bruce Springsteens Jersey Girl that immediately came to mind when I first read a synopsis of the film under review, Down The Shore. But you can, and you also can visualize the backdrop of that same shore in this film which had been  actually shot in that locale.

That however may be the best thing about this film though since the combination of a Jersey Shore institution, an amusement park and that shoreline is what was memorable about the film. Certainly the plotline did not hang together or make sense, or rather seem believable. Lets see. It seems that drunken amusement park rides owner Bailey (Golfdofini) had a sister with some cash who went to France after finding out she was terminally ill. While there she met and married an amusement park ride owner, Jack, who after she passed away wound up on the Baileys Jersey shore working-class house with his sisters ashes, a deed to a share in the house and plenty of siss dough.  From there though the transition is rocky as the Baileys past, his best boyhood friends Wiley, and Wileys wife, Mary, and (and Bailys ex-girlfriend) stir up the old days to nobodys benefit. Wiley has turned into a wife-beating crack-head, Bailey is tore between friendship and love, and Wiley is just a bastard. They all share the secrets of the past, a past that included murder, father murder, which seems to haunt all their actions and relationships with each other. See what I mean standard Jersey Shore stuff set against the rugged beauty of the shoreline and the seen-better-days town. Stay home and listen to Springsteens Jersey Girl, that one says it all.",1400976000,,2114,4.754768392370572
5559841,4,B00B6OEB6S,"This movie has the ingredients for something great,but if you don't watch closely,it is easy to get lost in the story line because things are left out- I had to watch it 2x to actually follow,and fill in what I hadn't caught the first viewing. I did like the movie,James Gandolfini is his sweet,somewhat troubled self and carries the movie. I wasn't that impressed with the actress who played Mary,mainly because there wasn't any chemistry between her and Gandolfini. I enjoyed the movie for the most part as it was suspenseful and does have a  ending that brought tears to my eyes- an ending where you kind of just get to figure out for yourself what happens.",1397088000,,660,4.641025641025641
5559842,4,B00B6OEB6S,The movie was okay. The only saving quality for me was James Gandolfini. I guess I just didn't like the role he was cast. We lost a great actor and human being when he passed away. Not sure I will watch it again.,1396396800,,212,3.953488372093023
5559843,3,B00B6OEB6S,"Too bad I had to say goodbye to the great actor, James Gandolfini, with this movie. Excellent acting, trite script, and adios James.",1396137600,,132,4.782608695652174

5559845,5,B00B6OEB6S,An interesting other side to James Gandolfini is shown in this film. A great addition for JG fans. I really enjoyed this film about friends who happen to live at the NJ Shore and the characters draw you in..,1385337600,,207,4.333333333333333
5559846,5,B00B6OEB6S,A nice little indie flick with some outstanding performances by some very hood actors. Gandolfini delivers in one of his last films.,1378512000,,132,5.045454545454546
5559847,5,B00B6OEB6S,This is a touching film with great performances.  I watched it twice.  Gandolfini was very poignant as a person who was being held hostage by a mistake.,1377734400,,152,4.592592592592593
5559848,2,B00B6OEB6S,"I purchased this movie because it was filmed in Keansburg, my hometown. I was also an extra in one of the bar scenes (they cut me out). All of that aside, it was really cool to see my hometown in the movie and to watch some of the parts that I saw them filming. Other than that, honestly, not that great.

5559849,4,B00B6OEB6S,"I bought this movie because of its start, James Gandolfini, and the town of Keansburg as the location.
I did think the movie moved a little slow, and was very melancholy, but over all enjoyed the acting and scenery, being from the Jersey shore.",1376352000,2,244,4.568181818181818

5559851,4,B00B6OEB6S,"I enjoyed this movie particularly because I loved James Gandolfini and I thought the plot was much better then I originally thought it would be.  Most of all, I enjoyed this movie because it was filmed in Keansburg NJ, and this town is where I have lived for almost 50 years.",1374710400,2,275,4.392156862745098
5559852,5,B00B6OEB6S,"James Gandolfini, as Bailey the brother of Susan is faced with a lot to deal with in this movie.  The past, present and the future because of what happens to his sister Susan who is played by Maria Dizzia.  Edoardo Costa, as Jacques the husband of Susan comes to bring back his wife to Bailey.  The hurt that Bailey has that his sister is never truly coming back again, brings up the past secrets that Wiley played by Joseph Pope, who is Bailey's Friend and Mary played by Famke Janssen is Wiley's wife and friend to Bailey and mother to Martin played by John Magaro, who is mentally challenged.  You have to watch this movie to see the things that come out about keeping secrets and how they can be used against someone for years.  The acting by everyone in this movie is down to earth and makes the story believable for the audience.  Make sure to rent or buy this movie it is a keeper for years to come of what the life is here in America of keeping secrets to use against others for the gain of money.

I rented it and intend to buy it for my collection of movies that are worth keeping.
