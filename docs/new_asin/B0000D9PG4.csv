1921602,5,B0000D9PG4,"My 4-year-old is just beginning to get interested in ballet and dance and the Angelina Ballerina stories and DVDs provide loads of inspiration whilst serving to entertain at the same time.

In ""Angelina Ballerina- Angelina in the Wings"", there are 4 episodes altogether [12 mins each] - ""Angelina in the Wings,"" ""Treasure Tandems,"" ""Two Mice in a Boat"" and ""The Cheese Ball Cup."" The animated stories remain faithful to the source material by Katharine Holabird, and retain the original illustrations by Helen Craig. The quality of the animation is above average, lending an almost real-life quality to the little mice, and the language is clear [British accent is used here]. In between the animated episodes, there are scenes of actual dance lessons, either ballet, folk or others.

I'd highly recommend the Angelina Ballerina series of DVDs to aspiring young dancers, those who love immersing themselves in a world inhabited by adorable little mice and this is probably suited to preschoolers and up.",1240790400,2,1003,5.185185185185185
1921603,5,B0000D9PG4,"Angelina, the mouse who loves ballet is now on video with four tales.  Each tale tells of some of her struggles and teaches an important lesson without being too preachy.  On this video we have:
Angelina in the Wings - Angelina wants to be the new Sunbeam but the part goes to little Henry.  Angelina must overcome jealousy and Help Henry or he will lose the part.
Treasure Tandems - Angelina and Alice are in a tandem-cycle race.  But is winning the race more important than helping others in trouble (even if it IS the Twins)?
Two Mice on a Boat - Angelina and troublesome Sammy need to learn how to work together in the boat decorating contest or all of their hopes will be washed downstream.
The Cheese Ball Cup - Troublesome Sammy teases William about Ballet, so William quits and takes up cheese ball (really rugby).  But everyone learns an important lesson.
Four fun stories.  The last three are quite appropriate for boys as well as girls as they involve strong male characters (as opposed to the babyish Henry in the first story).",1059436800,14,1039,4.589189189189189
1921604,5,B0000D9PG4,"Based on the popular Angelina Ballerina books by Katherine Holabird, this video will not fail to delight promising ballerinas of all ages.  My 3-year old daughter loves to hear the Angelina stories over and over again and was thrilled to see one of her favorite characters come to life!
The animation is crisp and clear, almost seeming three dimensional at times.  Two of the main characters, Miss Lilli and Angelina are voiced by Dame Judi Dench and her daughter Finty Williams.  There could not have been better casting for these voices as they are soft, smooth, and very calm sounding even when Angelina is in crisis.
The video consists of four 12-minute vignettes that deal with Angelina and her friends learning important lessons as they follow their dreams of becoming ballerinas.  I think that both this one and Rose Fairy Princess will become staples in every little girl's video collection!  Hopefully they will be releasing more in the future.  Highly recommended.",1022112000,20,974,5.0186335403726705

8000272,3,B0000D9PG4,"I purchased this Dvd for my daughter's third birthday because she loves the Angelina Ballerina we watch on PBS.  However, this was NOT the Angelina from PBS! The animator/illustrator is different, more like the illustrations in the original books.  The stories were ok, but Angelina is more snitty and has more ""attitude"" than I remember on PBS.  I miss the sweet, spunky ballerina who learns how to be a gracious, loyal, kind friend.",1354320000,,434,4.917808219178082
