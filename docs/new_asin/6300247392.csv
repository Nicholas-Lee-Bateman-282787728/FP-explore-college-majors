265516,5,6300247392,"An overlooked, gripping drama that is notable for its young rising stars (Timothy Hutton, Sean Penn, Tom Cruise) and also its prescience, as noted by another commentator here, although I think that none of the Amazon reviewers to date has hit the nail on the head with ""Taps"" and its overarching theme.

The movie begins fairly conventionally, with the teenage military cadets and their venerable institution shown to the viewer to be upright, virtuous, and full of sound moral values.  The youths may be a bit immature at times, and callow, but their earnestness and sincerity are shown as admirable and their devotion to their gruff, benevolent commandant (George C. Scott,  perfectly cast) is unquestioned.  You can literally hear the Sousa marches playing in the background.  But just when you think you're in for a predictable, one-sided, nattily uniformed prep school movie preaching the military virtues, the plot takes a darker twist and we learn that appearances can be very deceiving.  Faced with the closing of the school, the boys turn renegade, immediately betraying their duty of obedience in the emotions of the moment.  While determined, brave,  and motivated by principle, they are at the same time defying legal authority and behaving unwisely.  Recognition of this causes the relationships and trust among the cadets to splinter tragically.  Through the words  of Hutton's career soldier father -- a wonderful supporting performance, with the hard, practical professional tearing down the cadets' naivete --  we are presented a picture of Scott's commandant that does not fit the boys' hero-worshipful image.  And then the national guardsman who arrives to end the armed takeover of the school acts as Hutton's conscience, pointing out to him how far from the path of honor he has truly strayed.

Hutton's friends -- the pragmatic Penn, who wants to end the conflict peacefully,  and the belligerent Cruise, who lusts for a bloody showdown -- tug him in two directions and he manages to antagonize both of them, furthering his sense of isolation and failure.  Finally, the  accidental but predictable death of an extremely young  cadet  -- no more than a boy -- is lain at Hutton's feet, and is more than he can bear.  There is no glory or purpose in this death -- ""You just think about what a great little kid he was, and how much you're gonna miss him,""  Hutton  is forced to acknowledge, in the movie's big statement: that high-flown rhetoric  about dying for honor and country  isn't enough.  ""There must have been something more that we weren't taught,"" he tearfully reflects.  Subtly,""Taps"" has moved away from preaching the sanitary hagiography of ""Dulce et decorum est / pro Patria mori"" to address a greater truth -- that without wisdom,  military virtues and sacrifices are just so much posturing and lead  only to waste and misery.  It was a brave statement to make back when this film was made and an even more important concern in 2005.  The final shots -- a grieving Penn  and  the surviving cadets slowly fading into the mist, then an abrupt cut to a reprise of the triumphant military review sequence from earlier in the movie (is this supposed to be a vision of Hutton's entrance into Valhalla?) -- starkly hammer this point home.

A fine, thoughtful movie that is sympathetic to all its characters but also does not shy away from condemning their blindness.  As an ROTC alumni myself (at one stage of my life I would have loved to attend a school like this, and part of me still would), I salute it.",1107907200,87,3536,4.897306397306397
265517,5,6300247392,"First of all this is the only movie I can watch that has Tom Cruise in it. I can't stand that guiy, but he was OK in this. Sean Penn also plays a good role. Hutton and George C. Scott I felt had a good and believable chemistry together.

Well we all know the story and plot. It's in a dozen reviews here. What I like about this Alamo type movie is that there are people willing to defend what they love. There are also some people who will fight and die for what they love even though they know from the start that they are going to lose.

Despite what some say, I think Hutton did a superrb job. As did the rest of the cast. I for one would be proud of these boys if this happened in real life. All down the ages the youth always get a bad rap, but kids can surprise you.",1104192000,5,772,3.8797468354430378
265518,4,6300247392,"If you are a military buff, or a fan of Tom Cruise, Sean Penn, or George C. Scott, then this is the movie for you. Very interesting plot, (honor, duty, country) patriotic, some action, but seems to drag along at times. Great movie to watch if you have nothing to do.",1083888000,2,266,4.235294117647059
265519,5,6300247392,"Saw this movie on cable a few years after it came out.  I didn't think too much of it back then--but what a difference 20 years makes!  Taps is, without a doubt, one of the best teen angst movies ever made.  The unique twist here is that teens are (literally) fighting for increasingly anachronistic ideals:  duty, honor, and country.  Partly due to their methods & partly due to their militaristic demeanor, the society outside the school gates (good symbolism here) spurns their cause.  In the time since 1981, the trend has been to tolerate, defend, and even reward, abberrant behavior.  As a result, the film gets high marks for correctly predicting that these kids are on the wrong side of history.  The casting was also extraordinary with outstanding performance all around.  Cruise's performance was especially strong--perhaps the best he's ever done.  I also find it uncanny that this film was able to cast two of today's top stars (Penn & Cruise) as leads.  These factors have actually helped Taps improve with age--an extremely rare achievement.",1079136000,13,1055,4.9714285714285715
265520,5,6300247392,The cast is 100% all star and the movie is excellent about young men with one goal but different values about what they would do to achieve that goal. A great hit movie!,1062201600,4,169,4.151515151515151
265521,5,6300247392,"Given the other reviews, plot summary in this one would be superfluous, yet I feel compelled to say ""Taps"" is a deeply moving tragedy. The characters are very real, the situation is very believable. The film has its share of comic relief, but the story is so sad and the acting so very good (even Cruise, whom I generally loathe, was perfectly cast) that if you are given to tears you may prefer to watch it alone, but whether you are or whether you're not, you definitely should watch it.",1044230400,23,489,4.444444444444445
265522,5,6300247392,"A much bigger guy comes into the shower and shoves you over to the next space. You say, ""Thank you, Sir!"" Where are you? Right-- a military academy! Those who have been in one, or even who have been in the  military, will have a special understanding of this film. I appreciated  ""Taps"" because it made me consider the many definitions of  'honor', and it explored how far someone will (or should) go-- to be a true  friend.
Just as Brian makes Senior-Cadet, the civilian leaders decide  that Bunker Hill Military Academy must close its doors in one year.  Although there indeed seem to be few young recruits coming into the  academy, money is claimed not to be the problem so much as public attitude  that such institutions are no longer necessary. When General Bache, an  aging military veteran and head of the school, accidentally shoots and  kills one of the town's civilian red-neck youths, immediate closure is  demanded. With sincere beliefs that they are upholding the institution's  honor, the cadets seize control, send the dean and teachers out in a bus,  and prepare to defend. The only problem I had with this movie was that, in  reality, 'honorable' cadets would never place their prepubescent troops on  the forward firing lines! (This action is what eventually leads to the  collapse of the cadets' Worthy Cause.) After a terrible tragedy, Brian is  still supported by his loyal friend Alex, but is left wondering ""what  went wrong?"" All the words of Brian's hero, General Bache, had sounded  so right!",952732800,7,1518,4.836575875486381

265658,4,6300247392,"I recently saw *Taps* (1981) after a great many years. The movie is notable as a launching pad for Sean Penn and Tom Cruise, and a commendable follow up vehicle for Timothy Hutton coming off his Academy Award supporting performance in *Ordinary People* (1980). Each acquits himself brilliantly, though Penn and Cruise evidence what would later seem a strange reversal of role types. Penn is the levelheaded, reflective, ambivalent and brooding cadet who nevertheless falls back on his guiding principle: My friend, right or wrong! (""I might be a little ragged around the edges, but I don't walk out on a friend.), while Cruise is the gung-ho, borderline psychopathic militarist whom one senses is less concerned with the cause than he is with a chance to prematurely taste the glory of battle. Hutton as the incoming cadet major of the military academy likewise comes off as conflicted. He is the scion of a military family and seemingly embraces all things military, its traditions, pomp and, most of all, honor, as he sees it as his sacred duty despite his apparent disdain on a personal basis for his master sergeant father currently serving in the U.S. Army. Huttons character worships (not too far from literally) the academys venerable commandant, a retired army general whose checkered career is later hinted at by Huttons characters father, much to his sons utter contempt.

What impresses me most about the film is its scripts treatment, its evenhandedness in shaping the social issues of the times, a rare such example from a Hollywood largely wedded to leftist ideology. It characterizes both the left and the right negatively without becoming overly preachy on either score. To many, military academies like Bunker Hill seem anachronistic, but to most of its students steeped in its traditions it represents all that is virtuous of an America in dramatic post-Vietnam War societal transition. Youths from the town are essentially characterized as loudmouthed punks and provocateurs whose actions unwittingly prompt the rebellion and tragedy in the making in the academy that is shortly to befall it; a tragedy that causes Huttons character to finally embrace reality all too late with a disillusionment so poignant that it becomes palpable. Honor doesnt count for **** when you're looking at a dead little boy. All you think about is what a neat little kid he was. A sense of sadness pervades this dark but intriguing movie and rises above it to life in general. Nothing lasts.

George C. Scott, as the commandant, and Ronny Cox as the conflicted National Guard commander who so sympathizes with the cadets he must shortly and reluctantly move against, contribute stellar performances amongst the adult supporting cast. The movie is based on *Father Sky*, a novel by screenwriter Devery Freeman who apparently was not asked to write the script, perhaps because of major changes made. Id recommend this film wholeheartedly as it stands up admirably against the test of time and can serve as an allegory for many a life situation as the late Roger Ebert suggested in his favorable review written at a time when Penn and Cruise were largely unknown to movie audiences.

In conclusion, one is reminded of Robert E. Lees remarks in the aftermath of Picketts Charge: It's all such a waste. Too, too sad.",1485820800,,3309,5.0236794171220405

Timothy Hutton, tom Cruise and Sean Penn in what had to be their first roles? maybe Timothy did ""Ordinary People"" first. This was about a group of Military School Students who were losing the school to industrialization. George C. Scott is the Commander and when the local Townies cause some trouble the school is going to be shut down ASAP instead of one more year. of course, we have the usual types of characters. it is a very good film for the days and one worth watching to see the start of so many careers.",1464998400,3,644,4.201612903225806

266768,5,6300247392,"Dusted this off and watched it on Netflix the other day.  Haven't seen in in about a year.  I've always enjoyed this movie, even though it has a dark somewhat melancholic tone to it.  The cast is impressive in that so many future actors are in it, Tom Cruise, Timothy Hutton, Sean Penn,Giancarlo Esposito.  It's set at a military academy in the early 80's, so their is still some of the post Vietnam military bias left in the country.  The academy is threatened with closure but the superintendent Gen Bache played by the excellent George C. Scott is determined to keep it open.  He does channel Patton in this, but plays a slightly haunted man.  He speaks to his cadets about duty and honor, but more in the past tense rather then current I think.  An old soldier who has seen to much and hasn't kept up with the times.  An incident occurs in which a civilian teenager is accidentally killed by the general, who is then taken into custody.  The cadets led by Timothy Huttons's character Brian Moreland then cease the weapons at the academy and take it over, in protest of their school being turned into condominiums.  A siege ensues, the commanding officer of the police and national guard is led by Ronny Cox's character Col Kerby.  Kerby is an interesting contrast to Bache.  Bache is more the old style romantic warrior where Kerby is the more modern and realistic.  ""I have the career goal of all soldiers and that is to stay alive."" he tells Brian Moreland during negotiations.  Both men have different views and represent different eras of the army but are honorable.  Their is a slight anti-gun message in this movie I think, but it is subtle and I feel that the director, despite the feeling of the show being anti-military still respects those who serve.  If you haven't seen it and like military shows, this is a good one.",1452297600,,1833,4.590769230769231

He proved it was no error as he turned in a sterling performance in TAPS.  Add to it future superstars Tom Cruise, in his second film, and Sean Penn, in his first big screen effort, put forth solid performances along side Hutton.  This well done tale of a situation that gets out of control at a military academy after a tragic clash between townies and cadets ends in a death.  The academy is going to be torn down for condos and without the leadership of their commander General Harlan Bache (George C. Scott) the cadets poor decision to barricade themselves in leads to a senseless and terrible end.  Well acted drama of a out of control situation and well worth the watch.

267055,3,6300247392,".....and very youthful actors Hutton, Cruise and Penn all deliver.  This movie is worth seeing just to see the riveting performances turned in by all 3.

For me, though, the preposterous premise of the plot made it impossible to take this movie seriously.  Here we have a very small school populated by kids ranging in age from 10 to 18, whose intelligence levels make them candidates for consideration for admission to the nation's service academies - institutions which have some of the highest admissions standards in the country - and we're supposed to believe that, as a group, they think that they'll be able to force the rightful owners of private property to call off the sale of the property by taking it over with military force, and then make the decision to go to war with not only the heavily armed local police department, but also a United States military unit armed with heavy weaponry and tanks?  And their provisions and weaponry consist of a single truck load of food and a single room's worth of small arms?

It's hard to believe that a group of MS13 gang members would make such dumb moves, let alone a group of the brightest, most disciplined kids in the country.  Supposedly their devotion to the school's leader, played by George C. Scott, has driven them to such extreme action.  But while it's evident that the older kids have the utmost respect for the General, there's no indication that he has them brainwashed to the extent they'd want to tee it up against a fully armed National Guard combat unit.  Scott appears only briefly in the movie and makes not much more than a passing remark to the commanding cadet (Hutton) about putting up a fight to keep the school going before he exits the film.

It's a fairly entertaining way to pass a couple of hours and, as I've already mentioned, interesting because of the performances of 3 future superstars.  But 5 stars and, as some have proclaimed, one of the greatest movies of all time?  C'mon.  The premise is just a little silly for that.  :)

From a technical aspect, I didn't think the blu-ray picture was particularly sharp.  I know it was made in 1981, but ""Casablanca"" was filmed in 1941 and has a much sharper picture.  Also, the volume level on the disc is very low.  I nearly had to max out the volume on my receiver to hear the dialogue at times.",1415664000,7,2332,4.594202898550725
267056,5,6300247392,"A riveting movie of youth in a military school and training camp, and how their academic and military superiors influence and some make a profound effect on the boys, to the point, that it even affects their relationships with their parents, how they view life and even, death. Does one obey the protocal of honor or does one rebel against ones conscience? Does one adhere to the status quo for the sake of personal acceptance among ones peers, or does one do what is right, even if it goes against the regimented, rule of authority? This film clearly illustrates that even a youth with a gun, can and will, start a rebellion and not really comprehend the full meaning of why they are participants of it?! The youth are indeed, very impressionable. And want desperately to please those in authority, whom they admire. It gives them a sense of belonging and loving approval. For even a madman like Hitler, correctly recognized, that ""...if you can take the youth, you can take a nation!"" Intense drama with plenty of sobering action.

It was good movie although one may wonder where the parents of the teen-age cadets are. In addition to that,we also get to realize that war and violence isn't the solution to the problems we face in the world just like the cadets did at the end of the film.

267313,1,6300247392,"Mundane plot a bunch of idealistic cadets who opposed the closing of their military academy and decided to barricade themselves to prevent it from closure. I see this as pure non sense who on earth with the sane mind to make a stand off for a school simply that it is closing down. They are not going to lose their jobs? Can they not choose another academy to transfer? Isn't it realistic that it must close down due to economic or whatever reason? Totally incomprehensible even for the most patriotic, radical and idealistic to cause such a situation to keep the school by force. Shallow and silly story, no one would ever do such a thing especially for a school for a church yes I can see a stand off due to fanatical beliefs but for a military academy it doesn't make any sense.",1309046400,7,781,4.430555555555555

This is one of the worst disks I've seen when it comes to edge enhancement (meaning halos around every person and object). The picture looks completely artificial. I don't understand this. The picture was obviously soft to begin with but we're talking here about a movie from 1981. What can you expect? So the proper thing would have been to leave it soft instead of all this terrible contrast boosting. Bottom line: Stay with the DVD.

General Harlan Bache, the head of the academy, tries to quell the rebellion, but soon he too is swept up by the students' to-the-death determination when the Army is called in to rout the boys.

267404,5,6300247392,"This was a great movie to an impressionable young girl interested in becoming a psychologist and now it is even more interesting to the woman interested in writing. This movie made movie stars of Sean Penn. He was so great for one so young. His best scene was when he was trying to get his best friend to see that the current course of action was to far above them and he needed to figure out a way to get out without losing respect. Tom Cruise, as the young man to whom shooting a gun was always the answer and he was the one you grew to dislike, but still felt sorry for. And of Course, Timothy Hutton, who just off his first professional movie role and an Academy award, did a fine job as a young leader of a military school, that after 150 years has been assigned to close, in a year's time. It is his final year of High School and he is given the top honor of Cadet Major. When a  series of unfortunate events leaves him in charge of over 100 young boys, 12-17, he tries to hold on to the only lesson he has ever learned from the man he as grown to loved as a father.
The conflict of trying to do the right thing, maintain order, and dealing with a sense of his youth and inexperience are apparent throughout.
This is a fine movie to see, but history of this country's climate about war and authority are recommended. Otherwise enjoy the fine acting of these once young and  still talented actors.",1240963200,6,1402,4.20817843866171
267405,5,6300247392,"Imagine, this is the movie that discovered Sean Penn and Tom Cruise, being this both of their debut roles. And the acting in this movie shows it, as great performances are given all the way around, especially by Timothy Hutton. What might be even more amazing is that I've never heard of this movie before two weeks ago.

In fact, I imagine that today's audiences couldn't sit through the first thirty minutes, as it's mostly filled with dialogue, and seemingly boring military school proceedings. But this is all very important, as it shows you the full load of dynamite just waiting to go off. Then as the movie progresses, it quickly delves into a 'Lord of the Flies' situation where there's youth in revolt. As the drama and tension rises, it soon becomes very clear that despite what you hope for, all will not end well. And when the end finally does come, it's hard to watch, even though it almost seems necessary.

The movie is certainly though-provoking, taking on themes of independence, military school, indoctrination, brain washing, honor, duty, dignity, courage, and fighting for what you believe in. They're thoughts that stay with you for awhile, and they offer no real answer, but it will challenge your beliefs.

Overall, an underrated and brilliant character masterpiece, with superb acting from some now famous stars, and a story that causes you to think. Granted, it makes me want to stay far away from military schools, and it's hard to watch at times, but ""Taps"" is a must-see movie.",1234137600,21,1505,4.848249027237354

267407,5,6300247392,"Astonishing cast in hindsight.  Timothy Hutton holds his own, despite other reviewer's opinions - - - to which they are entitled - - - but Penn and Cruise do strut their stuff and foreshadow their star power.  George C. Scott had begun his long and storied decline by this film and it is touching to see him herding these young Hollywood stallions along toward their careers.  The movie has deep meaning for any and all who went to a military academy while seeming much more shallow to those who attended public or private schools without the martial mindset.  Highly recommended to one and all, if only to see today's stars in their career infancy.",1229817600,3,649,4.666666666666667
267408,5,6300247392,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable, if not completely beleivable, movie - but then who said movies were supposed to be completely beleivable?

What was believable were the performances of the actors involved.  Timothy Hutton was perfect as the sensible yet fiercly principled and devoted leader of a group of boys at a military school, and Tom Cruise dynamite as the head of the Red Berets.  Keep in mind George C. Scott, the general, when he mentions to the newly appointed Timothy Hutton how war brings out the ""wolf"", a kind of primal elation that a man realizes only in warfare.  And many other things which help build a logic for what follows in the movie.

I was kind of in awe of it the first time I saw it some 26 years ago in a movie theater as an eleven-year-old kid.  I saw it again tonight on dvd then just to test my childhood powers of perception, to see if it was as cool as i remembered it, and it pretty much was!

Watching all these years later, though, I find myself wondering why there are no faculty at this school.  No staff, no maintenance crew, only the General and a bunch of boys.  Odd.  Even more odd is that I didn't even notice 20 years ago.  Still, a good watch on a rainy day, even it's just to see Tom Cruise firing a machine gun out the window like a maniac and screaming, ""It's beautiful, Man!!!  Beautiful!!!""",1198800000,6,497,4.395604395604396
267470,4,6300247392,"Here you have a military academy, which teaches our youngest Americans to be military cadets.  But, when the state decides that there is no longer any use for the academy, especially since the mayor feels that the grounds could serve as something more profitable than a military academy, the general (George C. Scott) who runs the academy (who has fought in many true wars), is told to address the cadets that the academy will close in one year.  All that you've learned about ""honor"", just forget about it.  It was a 151 year old joke and a waste of your time.

At the 151 year celebration of the academy, a bunch of drunk teens come to mess with the cadets and, of course, a fight escalated and the general himself pulls his gun and accidentally shoots one of the raucous drunk teens.  He then has a heart attack and is rushed to the hospital expecting to face charges for the accidental shooting.  It is then decided that the academy must shut down immediately.  The highest ranking cadet (Timothy Hutton) decides that he will not just shut down the academy just because the governor says so.  So he, Sean Penn, and Tom Cruise, and about a hundred cadets of various ages, establish their own call to arms and defend the academy against the governor.  The governor even brings out the real military to shut down the academy.  Of course, there's not a happy ending to this film.  Kids die standing up for what they've been taught to believe in, and all the good that could have come from these future defenders of our country is suddenly meaningless.  This film sends the message that the human mind is expendable.  Yes, we want to teach you ""honor"" and yes we want you to fight for whatever cause the government may send you off to do.  But, we also want you to be able to turn it off like a ""switch"", and return to being the useless drunk teens that put their thumbs to their noses in the name of our country's true integrity.  In this film, ""honor"" is proven to be an inconvenience if the government sees something more profitable to itself by other means.

It's an excellent film, but it sure can make you mad.  Add this film to your anti-establishment  - ""it's us against them"" films.",1186012800,6,2190,4.50126582278481
267471,4,6300247392,"TAPS was filmed at the Valley Forge Military Academy in Wayne, Pennsylvania, where I was a cadet and graduate back in the early 70's. As alumni, we were notified of the filming that would be taking place and so I got to see some of the action going on. Naturally, I looked forward to the movie coming out and I was rewarded with a fine, suspenseful action drama. Certain scenes, like the parade formations, the formals, and the in-barracks fooling around brought me back to my cadet years. Even the run-ins with the ""townies"" rang true, although it never came to the brandishing of weapons.

An icon of the military for student soldiers is taken hostage by the students after it is closed but elite students take it a step further.  When they are confronted with force they start to loose moral after various demeaning events happen.  It's a sad movie.  Even with everything crashing down they still remain structured and under control until towards the end.  If this movie was about dope or gangs it would be a classic in America but unfortunatly only a few of us can enjoy it for what it's worth.",1175040000,4,597,4.59433962264151

Each is forced to decide what honor demands from him and, ultimately, it is his comrade in arms who matters most.  It is not about love of country but love of each other that is the highest code which leads them to do honorable though misguided acts.  Is it an anti-war movie?  Is it an anti-militarism movie?  Or, is it more about the ties with which we bind ourselves to our own cliches?  The themes might be lost in the corney dialog but the themes are deep and meaningful despite the corn.  A great movie you will find hard to resist.",1167004800,4,620,4.482142857142857
267476,4,6300247392,"This movie is 25 years old now and to say it was prescient of anything, including the extraordinary careers to be enjoyed by Penn and Cruise, requires a heady dose of disbelief suspension.

When Alfred Lord Tennyson's son was killed at the Battle of the Somme, the greatest slaughter of humankind in any one day in the history of the world, he wrote, ""When they ask you why they died, tell them because their fathers lied.""

And I think that's the key to the movie. Penn's 'surrender with honor' and Cruise's 'death before dishonor' and Hutton's Hamlet-like indecisiveness, are the troika of what war embraces. Should we be at war, ever? Certainly not. Will we continue to be at war? Of course. And the battle within the mind is that there is no finish line of resolution. Certainly it is not decided by who euphemistically ""won.""

And here is the tougher question. Of the three roles portrayed by Hutton, Cruise and Penn, who was right? Well I submit to you that as long as we are going to pursue this folly, war, they all were right. And, they all were wrong.

And to add to the confusion, again picking on Hutton, Cruise and Penn, what if we don't have the Academy representing a kind of a medieval Honor Code, but we call it a church in San Antonio. Or a hotel in Ruwanda. What do you do then? It's kind of like drugs. Good drugs? Bad drugs? Who decides?

And you can even take it into the future and say what if unstable nations, some sworn to destroy the Great Satan, America, arm themselves with nuclear rockets?

See I don't think Cadet Shawn (Cruise) is wrong any more than I think Cadet Dwyer (Penn) is right. They are regrettably both right and wrong.

I gave it 4 stars because there are other movies, Paths of Glory for example, who don't fool you with child stars. They don't give you the easy way out. Do you build a bridge because you are in a Japanese prison camp in Burma or do you build the best bridge anyone built, better than the Japanese could build themselves? But it is a good movie and it is thought provoking. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury",1142467200,11,2063,4.427440633245382

Timothy Hutton, Tom Cruise and Sean Penn all give excellent performances.  When this movie was released, nobody had heard of Tom Cruise or Sean Penn, so it's kind of fun to see them at the beginning of their careers before fame and scientology changed them.  I saw it for the first time in 10 years on cable the other night.  Wow, what memories.  If you haven't seen it in a while, you won't regret buying this DVD.
