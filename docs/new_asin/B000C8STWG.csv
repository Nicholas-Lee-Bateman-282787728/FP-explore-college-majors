2453925,4,B000C8STWG,Great Rom-Com. Cute movie and very fun to watch. Shiri Appleby is awesome in her roll.,1420070400,,86,4.4375
2453926,4,B000C8STWG,"I'm a guy, and I am a sucker for well-done romantic comedies.  This is one of those. Yea, the plot is formulaic.  Two people meet and instantly recognize each other as opposites and complete unsuitable for each other.  Then they grow on each other and fall in love.  Miscommunication and mistrust leads to a breakup, followed by yada yada yada.  They end up with each other.  We've seen it countless times before.  But with a great cast, the usual quirky characters and roommates, this feels fresh.  The script is clever and is never stale or too syrupy.  Take a chance on this little gem.",1419292800,,589,4.586538461538462
2453927,5,B000C8STWG,"Good Movie Very clean and family oriented. Great message about not expecting perfection in any relationship. It's better to live in the real world than in a fantasy, no matter how much it sometimes hurts.",1412121600,,204,4.857142857142857
2453928,4,B000C8STWG,"The first time I watched this movie I thought it was ridiculous. I watched it again and loved it. Don't expect phenomenal acting or a deep plot, but expect a funny love story with a twist.",1401840000,,188,4.25
2453930,5,B000C8STWG,"I enjoyed this movie even though it is a little silly at times.  Cute acting by the main charaters and cute storyline.
A romantic movie with nothing offensive at all.  Good clean movie.",1399852800,,185,4.575757575757576

2453935,5,B000C8STWG,"I love this movie. The plot is cute, the characters are engaging, and the romance is adorable. I also adore Shiri Appleby and her character. I definitely recommend this if you are in the mood for a cute, fluffy romance. It's also pretty family-friendly if that is a big concern.",1361491200,,278,4.58
2453936,3,B000C8STWG,This movie had a different twist to it than I was thinking.  Don't watch the behind the scenes before watching the movie as it ruins the movie.  I think you have to watch the movie twice.  Once to see the movie and the second time to see how it plays after you know the secret.,1361145600,,277,4.0
2453937,5,B000C8STWG,Very different than what I expected and very pleasantly surprised.  I thoroughly enjoyed.  I highly recommend this movie.  5 stars!,1356652800,,131,5.45
2453938,4,B000C8STWG,"I found this little gem on netflix last night and thought it was a very enjoyable watch.  Nick Zano was great, the actor from boy meets world made it for me.  Talk about quirky, funny, and ridiculous, he was definitely the comic relief of the film.  The cast worked well together each possessing good chemistry with regard to their relative relationships.  I think it's worth having in your achive.  My only qualm is there seems to be 2 different DVD options with 2 different names for what appears to be the same film - ""Surreal Love"" and ""Everything You Want"".  What's up with that?",1355961600,,584,4.5673076923076925
2453939,4,B000C8STWG,"I wasn't sure about this movie until I saw it on Netflix.  It somewhat reminded me of the movie called Drop Dead Fred, only this one is way better and sweeter.  It has this vulnerablity, fear of real love, and fear of trust (kind of).  I would watch it again.  Happy viewing!",1347753600,,275,4.230769230769231
2453940,5,B000C8STWG,sometimes i just wonder why cute and funny movies like these never even get on the big screen i/o of just being a TV movie.  all those cinematic movies out there are either just full of nudity or vulgar language just so that they can sell but these easy and funny romantic comedies give you good laughs never even get recognized.  I also LOVE the soundtrack; some of the songs are great and i don't even know the singers but they are just awesome.  totally recommended =),1342656000,,471,4.390804597701149
2453941,5,B000C8STWG,"A story about finding ""Real"" love. This is a witty, funny, and imaginative story about love and knowing when to move on from childish things. I love this movie and recommend it to ANYONE who's looking for a laugh as well as a touching and inspiring love story!!",1336867200,,261,4.458333333333333

2453943,4,B000C8STWG,"This little charmer is a by-the-numbers romantic comedy, complete with wacky sidekicks.  A budding artist girl meets an art-challenged boy in a college art appreciation class.  The girl already has another boy, seemingly perfect, but he isn't what he seems (the twist).  The leads are attractively played, the supporting cast characterful, if occasionally a bit over-the-top.  Better production values than expected for a made-for-TV movie, set mainly in college, a Border's Bookstore, various art venues, and a few living spaces, with nothing stronger than a swear word, a little beer, and a kiss.  If you like the genre, and Disney, it's nicely done.

2453945,5,B000C8STWG,"I stumbled upon this movie in Blockbuster a few years ago and couldn't stop thinking about it.  Finally I decided I needed it for my home collection.  I thought the acting--both spoken and unspoken, facial expressions, etc.--was great, as well as the droll dialogue.  If you like light-hearted romantic comedies, this is a must-see.",1253836800,,332,5.111111111111111
2453946,5,B000C8STWG,"We loved this movie.  So funny and entertaining.  Low budget, but on par with Hollywood movies.",1215302400,,95,4.875
2453947,5,B000C8STWG,I ordered this for my granddaughter who is 17 as a gift.  She loved it.  She received it in about 7 days.,1200268800,,105,3.727272727272727
2453948,4,B000C8STWG,"Here we have a movie that was a lot of fun, not intellectually deep and quite predictable but entertaining.  While it was not devoid of profanity it was kept to a minimum and  there was not one F**K in the entire movie but it still managed to be fun.  There was not one car crash, explosion, or needless property destruction but it still kept my interest.  While the characters were not deep and the roommate was totally unrealistic -- as were the parents -- it was all in good fun.  The only really negative thing I have to say about the movie was the thundering sound track which I felt was unnecessary and distracted more than contributed to the film.  Nevertheless, this was a very entertaining film and if you are looking for something to watch that isn't going to annoy, insult, or embarrass you in front of your kids or girlfriend -- this is it.",1181606400,,852,4.42948717948718
2453949,4,B000C8STWG,"Ah, what a great way to spend a cold Sunday evening. This was a great little movie, cute and funny. The relationship between Abi and Si was great, if not a little unrealistic, but I guess imaginary friends are anything but real, right? Abi's parents were also a bit too goofy for me, but let's just thank goodness they're not mine!

Shiri Appleby is quite an accomplished actress, and she did well in portraying all different sides and emotions of the character as Abi grew and developed. I was very impressed with her and hope to see her play bigger roles in the near future. Orlando Seale I have always loved, and he played his role well, but I felt that Si's attachment to Abi was a bit too much. Nick Zano was the predictable ""annoying yet somehow charming"" guy that she doesn't really like named Quinn, and he also did well.

I just can't get over Will Friedle. The man is HYSTERICAL. He plays a ""not different, but challenged"" Canadian that sees the world in a different light. He pretty much stole the show for me, almost outshining the very endearing main characters. Other side characters were Jess, played by Alexandra Holden and Ryan, played by KC Clyde, both believable and entertaining actors. Jess is Abi's room mate and Quinn's cousin, the very blonde, but hard working and loyal best friend, and Ryan is the boss to both the girls in the local bookstore, but also Jess' ex.

The story starts with Abi, an art student, attending an art appreciation class alongside Quinn, who's labeled as the ""art is boring, I just don't get it"" type. Jobs are threatened, holidays are tangled, and Abi eventually tutors him into passing the class. Quinn becomes interested in her, knowing that she has a ""boyfriend,"" Si (who is in fact her dream guy and imaginary boyfriend). Si is jealous, Quinn is guilty, Abi is confused. However, the end is tied up sweetly and perfectly, wrapping the whole story up in a big red bow. Although it's only 90 minutes, this is a very cute romantic comedy. I look forward to sharing this with my family and friends.",1170633600,,2048,4.605479452054794
2453950,4,B000C8STWG,"It is becoming more the rule than the exception that movies made for television are the equal if not better than many of the works made for the theaters.  Such is the case for this little bit of fluff of a movie - EVERYTHING YOU WANT.  Based on a play by Natalie Prado and adapted successfully for the screen by Steven A. Lee and Kevin Lawrence King, this film is lightweight but carries itself with style and fun by director Ryan Little and makes for an entertaining diversion of a film that is not about the heavier issues with which most films today are dealing.

Abigail Morrison (a charming Shiri Appleby) grew up with absentee parents and spent her idle hours drawing and creating an imaginary friend Sy (Orlando Seale) to care for her loneliness.  Unfortunately she has carried Sy into her adult life, preventing her from dating real human beings.  As an art student she paints her imaginary boyfriend who is always there for her and makes her mistrustful of real guys who are bound to desert her...!  Abby meets a cocky young student Quinn (Nick Zano) faking his interest in art to get easy college credits.  There is a mutual attraction that takes some time to develop: Abby talks about her boyfriend Sy to shield her vulnerability.  Abby's friend Jessica (Alexandra Holden) is aware of Abby's imaginary Sy and attempts to get her to date real men.  But Jessica is not without her problems - maintaining employment at Borders Bookstore being one of them - and through a series of accidental encounters, Quinn steps in to help Jessica keep her job on the promise that Abby will coach him in art.  The obvious happens and Quinn's growth as a person mirrors Abby's ability to forego her need to hide behind Sy and the two become a couple.

The young cast is attractive and for the most part acts well.  There are some strange subplots that don't add much to the storyline but at least introduce some different offbeat characters.  A deep movie this is not, but for an evening of light entertainment, this little film glimmers. Grady Harp, September 06",1157932800,,2057,4.649171270718232
2453951,5,B000C8STWG,If you like Shiri Appleby then this movie is for you.  Miss Appleby is the mixture of strength and vulnerability she always showed in Roswell.  She illustrates the mistaken lack of concern some parents have for the job of raising children.  Her character rises above this but the character's vulnerability makes her unable to let down her defences until she finds real love.,1154736000,,374,4.904761904761905

2453953,5,B000C8STWG,"I would love to rate this movie because it is so funny and entertaining. The characters were easy to relate to and were kind hearted. I love the family channel movies! I think some of them are better then theater movies. They are lighthearted and upbeat. Hopefully more fmaily channel movies will be coming to DVD. I also liked Shiri Appleby in another family channel movie called ""Pizza my Heart"". I also think it was a cute movie. I highly suggest purchasing this DVD!",1145318400,,470,4.607142857142857
