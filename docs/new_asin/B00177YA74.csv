3167719,5,B00177YA74,Its really amazing when you see an actor as big as Josh Hartnett working on a serious film. I think this is one of the first films to really show his diversity. The man can act! I think that down the road we're gonna look back on this film as the turning point in his career - the point at which he starts working on more than just big/predictable Hollywood films. I heard he's now acting on the London on the live-stage version of Rain Man. The film has a really good story about the dot com crash back in 2001 - which is really appropriate with what's going on with the stock market right now. It will be a very cool addition to your DVD collection.,1225324800,2,651,4.133858267716535
3167720,5,B00177YA74,"I am a fan of Josh Hartnett.  He is so sexy and good looking.  I have watched ""August"" over and over.  I enjoyed his acting in this movie with Naomie Harris.  The race mixing is beautiful.  There should be more movies produced like this.  However, the story line shows that you can never think that you are so high and above anyone in the business world.  You will be brought down eventually.  Anyway, I enjoyed this movie.  It wasn't long enough and I hope there's a sequel.
I recommend this movie to mostly anyone.

Love you, Josh Hartnett

Scott reaches an excellent level of anxiety as he tries to evade his brother, but ultimately loves him even in failure.

Naomie Harris from ""Pirates of the Caribbean 2 & 3"" and ""Miami Vice"" does fairly well in a thin role as the object of the affections Tom Sterling can spare on anyone but himself.  Rip Torn who has a lone supporting Oscar nomination for ""Cross Creek"" in 1983 is a bit over the top as his father David.  Caroline Lagerfelt who was in ""Minority Report"" and works sporadically did well as the mother who can't quite keep her grown family together.  David Bowie's appearance is brief, but he looks good.

The best thing about this film is its look.  The cinematography and the wild nightclub look suit the story well.  I also liked the black and white photography on the cover of the DVD.  The big problem with the film is that the protagonist Tom Sterling is not likeable so when he fails we really don't care.  Boy creates business; boy is a creep; boy loses business, end credits.

3167724,1,B00177YA74,"I had wondered when a mainstream film would attempt to show the business sector just prior to 9/11, and this was advertised to be it - all the way down to the month name in the title. By itself August would mean nothing in a title unless it had something to do with what changes the world a couple weeks later.

The casting choices also peaked my interest with David Bowie, Rip Torn, Chirqui and Naomie Harris. Josh Hartnett plays the CEO of an Internet company going through significant financial troubles. He plays the front of the future being extremely bright and everything being OK, even though his company should have been folding yesterday. Especially once the mandated recovery deadline of September 14th passes, the world should be his oyster. With them actually mentioning an important date for their company, I thought the film might go that far chronologically, but they do not.

The story starts right out in the high gear Hartnett's character plays most of the film, but it quickly dissipates into boring subplots, tons of unanswered questions, and eventually really bad acting. Even Torn's performance was staged (on purpose I guess since he is way better than this). The one saving grace comes towards the end with David Bowie's three minutes on screen; he was very believable as the hostile takeover kind of guy. But he vanishes and the film comes to an ambiguous ending that never even alludes to the upcoming destruction. It just fades to black and you realize you just wasted 90 minutes. They do interject one CGI shot of the twin towers, but nothing else ties together to the title relevance.

Hartnett is adequate, but his upcoming role in I Come With the Rain looks significantly more challenging and productive. Chirqui's role was for two scenes, and Torn for just a few minutes.

  After I watched the movie I was really impressed with everything.  The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was that I never really did find out what Land-shark does as a company.  It struck me as a little depressing but it also has some real in it.  I am sure this type of thing happened to so many dot com start ups back in those days that its not even funny.  Someone who had no status at all starts a dot com and it blows up and they get WAY more money then they should have ever got and then everything falls apart because they don't know how to manage all of there success.  I am sure this happened to so many people so when i was watching this i couldn't help but think of all that.
  The bottom line is that this was a really good movie if you are into this kind of thing.  I don't like how some people just ""Dog"" this movie and talk down on it because I thought it was really good.  I would recommend it only to those who are into this kind of movie.

3167739,3,B00177YA74,"In ""August,"" Josh Hartnett plays a cocky, twenty-something entrepreneur named Tom Sterling who, for the past several years (the movie is set, rather portentously, in August 2001), has been riding the dot.com wave to easy fame and fortune - though he isn't quite prepared, either financially or emotionally, for the crash that is to come.  Landshark, the company he founded with his brother, Joshua (Adam Scott), and of which he is currently CEO, has a couple hundred employees on its payroll, but pretty much everyone who works there is at a loss to explain just what it is the firm does or produces.  Even worse, the company that was once valued at well over three-and-a-half million dollars is now worth just a paltry fraction of that amount, the ""business model"" having apparently failed to pan out as expected.

As written by Howard A. Rodman and directed by Austin Chick, ""August"" is essentially a cautionary tale set against the get-rich-quick hysteria that came to dominate in the early days of the internet, when virtually anybody with a half-baked idea and a smidgen of techno-savviness could become a high-stakes player on Wall Street.  That many of these people were making their fortunes out of little more than the cyber equivalent of chewing gum and bailing wire - while producing nothing of any real substance or value in the long run - is what eventually led to disaster for so many of them and for the economy as a whole.

""August"" does a reasonably effective job capturing the moral emptiness and emotional shallowness of the characters and the world they inhabit, but, when all is said and done, the movie lacks the dramatic heft and focus needed to turn it into a profound and major work.  The minor characters are bland and insufficiently developed, and even Tom is deficient in the kind of depth and shading he would need to make him a representative ""tragic hero"" for our time. That being said, the movie does offer some intriguing insights into the way the business world works these days and into which type of individual typically succeeds in the new arena.

This movie is about the problems a small business sees during the post 9/11 era.  Josh Hartnett is outstanding as a business owner facing the facts that his business is failing.  He's partners with his brother, and the brother tries to get Josh to face the reality that they need to sell the company and get out.  Josh is reluctant at first, but he soon starts to realize that his brother has a family to support, and the business was failing.

It's a drama without drama I guess.  There was just no point to it.  A big disapointment.",1235865600,2,501,4.689655172413793
3402241,4,B00177YA74,"I waited a long time for this movie to come to dvd, and I wasn't disappointed.  Josh Hartnett deserved a best actor nomination and I am not exaggerating.  This movie is about the problems a small business sees during the post 9/11 era.  Josh Hartnett is outstanding as a business owner facing the facts that his business is failing.  He's partners with his brother, and the brother tries to get Josh to face the reality that they need to sell the company and get out.  Josh is reluctant at first, but he soon starts to realize that his brother has a family to support, and the business was failing.  Great acting and story, you will not be disappointed.",1233014400,,653,4.491525423728813

8265183,5,B00177YA74,"Much as this movie appears to be about the dot-com bubble, it's really a character piece about the people IN that bubble.  Josh Hartnett - who I wrote off years ago due to that ""Wicker Park"" atrocity, which I hate with the heat of a thousand fiery suns - apparently went through some stuff between then and making ""August"", because he's quite amazing in this later film.  I was impressed by how well he portrayed the kind of bloviating, self-worshipping, entitled little prick that fueled that insane bubble.  From the very second he opened his mouth, I wanted to slap him across the room.  He's INSUFFERABLE.

But that is exactly what Tom Sterling is supposed to be, or rather how he presents to the world. This character has layers, but it's hard to see them precisely because Tom doesn't WANT anyone to see them.  So in order to grasp the character, you really have to pay attention, because hidden in that egomaniacal, bullying bravado is exactly what one would expect - a scared, lonely guy whom no one likes because he's the kind of guy who can get this job done, and who actually likes a guy like that?  (I found the moments when he reaches out to his brother and is inevitably rebuffed to be especially painful.)  He's an adolescent who never grew up, an arrested teenager who still thinks he can charm reality into rolling over for him, a puppy dog excellent at barking up a storm but hurt because nobody will pet him.  He's a slick, annoying bully, but he's also a wounded, defensive child lashing out at the world by forcing it to give him what he wants.  It's just that one day, the world decides it ain't gonna give him any more.

And that's when things get interesting.  That's when the complexity kicks in, the layers start to be revealed.  The very thought of losing what he has terrifies him, and the panic begins just behind his eyes and at the corners of his mouth, and spreads outward in waves until that great takeover scene, where Tom's face becomes a study in occulted terror - his entire world is ending, but he has to pretend he's on top of it. It's not just losing his job and his company. It's his entire future filling up with dead ends and unreturned calls and eye-rolling snark, and you can see it all right there in his eyes. Eyes, jaw, neck, posture - but especially the eyes.  I'm a sucker for scenes where the actor is going through some extreme upheaval but can't show it.  That's seriously challenging work that looks like it's not work at all, but is incredibly hard to pull off.  Take a look at Tom's face after he and his former girlfriend make love.  That's the face of someone frightened beyond words with no outlet for the fear that's stalking him.  It's that kind of detail that makes good acting, that kind of internal reality, and it works here to make Tom a real person instead of the poster boy he could easily have been.

Yep, this is the film that convinced me Hartnett was worth watching again.  True, ""I Come With The Rain"" is beautiful but it's not exactly subtle, though Hartnett's work on that character was also impressive, with his silences speaking a thousand times louder than his words.  That he's developed to where he can keep the screaming INSIDE, but still audible - man, my hat's off to him.  He's finally delivering on all that promise, and it's great to see his development.  He's been doing great work lately, and I look forward to more, yes indeed.

P.S. Kudos as well for how he managed to rattle off all that insane techno-babble as if it actually said anything.  When he went off on that ""e"" rant early in the film, it made me wonder if even HE knew what any of it meant.  Another thing I admire in good actors - the ability to make speech convincing whether they understand what they're saying or not.  You think it's easy, but believe me, it really, really isn't.

P.P.S.  One thing I found really funny is the name ""Tom Sterling"".  It's a name seemingly crafted to put across every bit of his egocentrism and superficial charm.",1438819200,,4001,4.4937759336099585
8265184,5,B00177YA74,"Taking place right before the tech crash of 2001, it's a great story with lots of beautiful perspectives. Josh and David Bowie do great performances. The locations are great, the cinematography is great. It's a classic. If the current HBO Silicon Valley show were to be compared with avengers, then this movie is the Dark Knight. It's an exploration of how hard it is to achieve something.",1438128000,,389,4.82089552238806

The problem with the movie is that none of the characters are likable and the story was so dull - I literally had to pause it halfway in and take a nap!",1354406400,,248,3.8627450980392157
8265189,4,B00177YA74,"The epic irony of course is that the fictitious company depicted in the film, Land Shark, (years ahead of its time, impressive but unrecognized or perhaps unneeded function, piecemeal devaluation) mimics the film itself in its less-than-glamorous critical reception and subsequent out-phase. Pick it up for $2 and amaze yourself that at one point in time, theaters were charging $12 for a one time view. And yet this film will always hold a place amongst people with advanced brain wiring and an abnormal taste for perennial melancholia. It manages to capture every emotion that the dot com boom losers felt during each stage of their venture: the eagerness, the exploitation (""We can do this!"" as Tom laments to an apathetic bartender), the hype, the VCs, the market saturation, the market loss, the return of the VCs, the bitter end (""It's over"" as Tom closes) and of course throughout, the undying, Olympian hubris in the midst of Silicon Valley's renaissance. Ask any CEO of a surviving software giant spawned or aggrandized during the period, and he will probably tell you Tom Sterling is him in his youth, although with much less talent and without all the failure. I personally tend to think of Ellison, and although somewhat in a different category, the late Steve Jobs when I see this film, the aberrant, happy-go-lucky geniuses who could so casually shield their companies from speculation with one suave, cutting-edge speech. As a teenager, with my dad in the technology biz, these guys were the James Bonds of my world.

But there was never any mention of the losers. I never heard their stories. The guys above were cool because they were (are) well-spoken, smart, and contrarian, but also because they succeeded, because their companies succeeded. How cool would it be if James Bond didn't win in the end? Enter the world of literature, of epic tragedies, the world in which August so fittingly belongs. It is this world that has us asking ourselves overarching questions like ""Why are we proud?"" ""What do we really want?"" ""How far are we willing to go to get it?"". August, like any great literary work, prods and pries, while granting us a rare glimpse at the darker side of high technology.

The film's greatest strength, the sharp, pinpoint parlance, is also its greatest weakness, as I can see how easy it might be for the average film goer to quickly become uninterested in plot and character. It's almost as if the screenwriters were aiming to perplex the viewers so that all they would hear is a weird, cacophonous blend of legal, business, and geeky babble. But for those with access to a library, or the internet, and who have a thirst for knowledge, this obstacle can easily be overcome. And when you delve into the story, and really understand things, you get a sense of place and time, a sense of importance, and you can't help but think of other grand-scheme, underrated films like Wall Street (esp. the 2nd one). You start to make sense of your world a little better, yourself a little better, and if you also get over the equally cacophonous soundtrack, then you really start to enjoy the all-star pantomime.",1354060800,,3137,4.839851024208566
