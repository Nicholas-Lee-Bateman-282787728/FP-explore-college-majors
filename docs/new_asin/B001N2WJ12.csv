3709277,4,B001N2WJ12,I really enjoyed this. It is a departure from what I usually watch and it was very entertaining. The twists and turns kept me interested and wanting to go to the next episode. I just wish they had extended the ending for one more episode but *sigh* they didn't.,1292976000,,261,4.346938775510204
3709278,3,B001N2WJ12,"I bought this series on a whim and although I am not regreting the purchase, it is almost collecting dust on my bookshelf. The first 6 or so episodes were great. The plot seemed to be thickening, you knew that Kai would sometime realize that he is in an evil organization, etc. However, the episodes always left cliff hangers that you would anxiously skip through the opening captions to get to the next episode only to be greatly disappointed. Not only was the ending of the series rushed, it wasn't understandable.",1218758400,,516,4.681318681318682
3709279,3,B001N2WJ12,"The problem with this series is that it's filled with inconsistencies and the ending leaves much to be desired. It manages to keep you hooked by revealing juicy bits of the plot and the pasts of characters, but in the end, nothing is explained. And I mean NOTHING. Regardless of this, the overall series is still somewhat enjoyable, which is why I'm giving it a three. Certain episodes are great. Sadly, this fact makes it that much more aggravating when the story falls short. I'd say borrow it from a friend rather than buy it yourself. The best way to describe this series is wasted potential.",1177891200,,596,4.632075471698113

8323037,5,B001N2WJ12,"Great story! While there is some fan service, most of this is action/drama, a little comedy. Some of the ideas incorporated do reflect real life, but it's also a good deal of fantasy. If any of this sounds interesting, get it. You won't be disappointed!",1410912000,,253,4.644444444444445
8323038,4,B001N2WJ12,a series i thought it would have great battles scenes turns out to be less violent on the battle scenes so it was alright for me for a series that has its own persona message as anime not trying to go to big and epic in the story plots but i had a blast having a chance to own this series 4 stars cause anyone can be a fan of this instantly,1399161600,,340,3.736111111111111
8323039,3,B001N2WJ12,"Kai is an Esper, aka an E's. He takes a job working for a group of E's soldiers that catch criminal Espers. He does this to get good treatment for his sick sister. He soon discovers that the organization he works for is evil. He abandons them and begins to live with Yuki and his adopted little sister Asuka. He soon learns that life is more than just pain and suffering. His peaceful life is not going to last long. His old comrades are after him, and he has to rescue his little sister from the evil ASHURUM organization.

This anime started off very good. It reminded me of S-CRY-ed, which also kind of stunk. The voice acting, animation, and soundtrack are all pretty good in E's Otherwise. I admit that I got it because I saw the impressive voice actors that played roles in it. The story is just a total bomb. It moves really slow, and relationships between the characters never develop. It just cruises along at a mediocre pace and doesn't heat up. The ending is also really hollow. It looks like they ran out of money to finish it or something. I may watch it again and see if my opinion changes. But you shouldn't have to do that to find something enjoyable. I have to admit it, but this is an anime that I should have passed on.",1361836800,,1238,4.313304721030043
8323040,4,B001N2WJ12,This is an enjoyable anime. Good players in it. Good action scences and the art is done well. Only problem is that it did not havea good ending. Nothing was settled. The battle still continues. Still a good anime to watch,1361318400,,221,4.414634146341464
