8296286,3,B001E4C7HA,"Whatever surviving fame all-but-forgotten 1964 Italian western Pistols Don't Argue aka Bullets Don't Argue has is entirely peripheral: part of a two picture deal, this was the one Jolly Films spent most of their money and resources on while whatever was left over would go to a no-budget `recupero' oater shot on some of the same locations with some of the same crew, a cheap American TV western sidekick in the lead who only got the part because he was $1000 cheaper than Henry Silva and Sergio Leone directing.

That money isn't everything is almost immediately apparent in Mario Caiano's effort, which has a bit more of a budget to play with but is no more than perfectly decent but unexceptional second feature stuff with a past his prime but still game Rod Cameron in the lead as Pat Garrett, tracking down an impressively mean and agile Horst Frank and his eager to please but slow to kill brother Angel Aranda after they rob the local bank and kill its manager (""Sorry I spoiled your wedding, Pat"" apologises the dying man). Despite his unfortunate tendency to look like Joe E. Brown and Reg Varney at times and being, by his own admission, an actor whose expressions were limited to with or without a hat, Cameron's a capable enough lead even if he's not the stuff of Western legend. Most of the plot is taken up with the journey back from Mexico across hostile territory to avoid the Federales after he's illegally arrested his prey, with a band of bandidos in hot pursuit to get their hands on the stolen money. They're not exactly the smartest bandits on the block, constantly putting off attacking the three men en masse as their own numbers get steadily depleted, but what they lack in brainpower they make up for in tenacity.

You can see just why the producers had more confidence in this one - it doesn't reinvent the wheel the way Leone did, but there's plenty of decently staged action, it's surprisingly well directed and a lot of fun in its generic way. Caiano and his cinematographer Massimo Dellamano have a particularly good eye for the many and varied locations, from border towns and ghost towns to the same canyons and desert used for the attack on Aqaba in Lawrence of Arabia, with the gorgeous colour photography well reproduced on Ripley Home Video's English-friendly Italian DVD. The town may be the same as the one in Fistful of Dollars but it's shot in a very different and much more conventional way: this is from the period when Italians were copying American westerns on the cheap rather than reinventing the genre on their own terms (if anything the influence is more Bud Boetticher than Robert Aldrich). The credits have been Americanised even on the Italian print, with Caiano becoming Mike Perkins and Ennio Morricone becoming both Dan Savio and Leo Nicols, contributing an enjoyable but more conventionally American-style Western score with a decent title song, Lonesome Billy, sung by future spaghetti Western fixture Pete Tevis (pleasingly the DVD doesn't cut off the playout music). It doesn't always get away with the deceit, especially when the 7th Cavalry arrive in what look so much like leftover uniforms from the battle scene in The Leopard that you half expect Alain Delon and Terence Hill to be among their ranks.

The Italian PAL DVD offers a good 1.85:1 widescreen transfer (some sources list the film as 2.35:1, but it doesn't look like it's been cropped at all) with the Italian trailer and an interesting interview with the cheerful and amiable Caiano that's subtitled in English and covers the problems of shooting in Almeria, his friendship with Leone and the film's shortcomings, legal problems and unimaginative producers. Along with an unsubtitled Italian soundtrack it also offers the English-language dub, with Cameron voicing himself but the odd problem with a couple of the bit players and a cantina singer who can still be heard singing in a close-up with her mouth shut - but for many, that's just part of the charm of Italian westerns. And as long as you're not expecting a violent spaghetti Western but are happy watching a capable and undemanding old-fashioned Western that just happens to have been made by Italians, Spaniards and Germans, it's perfectly enjoyable fare.",1374796800,,4241,4.863070539419087
