3902621,2,B002C1GMYI,"German director John Brahm teamed up with character actor Laird Cregar to make two highly regarded Fox horror films, ""The Lodger"" and ""Hangover Square."" Before those two movies however, Brahm directed another Fox horror film, ""The Undying Monster,"" which lacked the budget, the quality script, and, most importantly, the acting talent that the other two films had. The not unsurprising result was a far more mundane film.

""Monster,""  made in 1942, plays like a cross between the previous year's ""The Wolf Man"" and the Basil Rathbone version of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles."" An English family inhabiting a very large and menacing castle in the country is terrorized by attacks by what may be a large dog or wolf, or, on the other hand, some sort of monster. The heiress to the family fortune calls upon a London detective to investigate, and he relies on scientific methods to find what he is convinced is a rational explanation for the earlier attack. For a while, the film plays out like a very bad Sherlock Holmes movie, with its own buffoonish female assistant and various characters vying to appear as suspicious as possible.

Fortunately, the movie's only about an hour long, and eventually the monster reappears and carries off the heiress, leading to a climactic chase through the marshes and woods. It's only in this climactic action sequence that the film comes alive. Brahm was a master at creating stunning black & white visuals, and, despite the fact that the actors are working on a set and not out in the woods, the sequence is exciting and highly interesting to watch.

In lesser directorial hands, the film would have been a disaster. However, Brahm manages to turn a routine chase, a ridiculous plot, and a cheesy monster into a few minutes of exciting viewing. It's just too bad viewers have to sit through 45 minutes of dreck to get there.

The DVD does have one interesting extra, a featurette on the career of John Brahm, focusing on his three Fox horror films, including ""Monster.""",1391731200,3,2007,4.856725146198831
3902622,5,B002C1GMYI,I am a fan of these movies. Its a must for anyone who can appreciate the old time special effects and the effort that went into them. I much prefer these to computer graphics,1367971200,13,174,4.147058823529412
3902623,4,B002C1GMYI,"Don't expect much in the way of shivering goose bumps from this comparatively tame 1942 werewolf tale.

Instead, be prepared to relish the film's atmosphere: its (""who-can-the-monster-possibly-be"") suspense; its dismal (almost surreal) craggy cliffs overlooking a storm-driven sea; and, best of all, the dark Victorian mansion housing (besides the ever-severe-looking butler played by Halliwell Hobbes) a host of plausible suspects -- and a few red herrings.

Taken all together, this is what makes THE UNDYING MONSTER -- filmed (and restored) in glorious black and white -- a must-have for collectors like myself.

As an added plus, the perennial ""prune-faced"" Eily Malyon stars briefly as Mrs. Walton, the housekeeper.  (""SPOILER ALERT"": Cross her off your list of suspects -- she is decidedly NOT the monster!)",1360195200,7,813,5.532258064516129
3902624,4,B002C1GMYI,"I've remembered certain moments from this film from seeing it on TV as a child, and swore that I'd track it down someday and watch it again, see how it holds up.

It's an odd one, primarily memorable (to me) as a film that doesn't show you the monster at the center of its story until nearly the end.  The first Alien followed a similar approach, to great effect.

Well, that part is true, but the new pleasures for me as an adult were its quirkiness, its attempts to serve as a psychological drama more than a horror film, and its subtle indictment of the privileges of aristocracy.  Very glad I tracked it down.",1347408000,13,613,4.350877192982456
3902625,3,B002C1GMYI,"Significantly more famous for the later films THE LODGER and HANGOVER SQUARE, director John Brahms does manage to bring a certain interest to THE UNDYING MONSTER--but although the film offers some atmospheric cinematography, the script is silly and the actors even more so.

The film is basically a riff on the earlier THE WOLF MAN with a touch of the SHERLOCK HOLMES series thrown in. For several hundred years the Hammond family has been plagued by a monster of some kind that tends to walk ""when stars are bright on a frosty night."" Helga Hammond (Heather Angel) does not believe the legend until her brother Oliver (John Howard) is attacked and miraculously survives. She is pressed to bring Scotland Yard scientist and detective Robert Curtis (James Ellison) in on the case, and after various twist and turns the monster is disclosed and dispatched. The actors are uniformly terrible, with James Ellison leading the pack; he spends most of the film shouting questions at people in full volume.

With all its faults, THE UNDYING MONSTER at leaves moves along at a good clip and it is actually watchable, at least for one time around. The DVD includes a few extras, including a documentary on director Brahms and the original trailer. For fans of classic horror it will be worth seeing once--don't expect too much and you'll enjoy it.

3902626,2,B002C1GMYI,"Atmospheric.  Execellent style and staging (borders upon Val Lewton country), but not enough substance to satisfy.  Silly script with an even sillier solution to the mystery.  If you've seen The Hound of the Baskervilles (1939 -- the one with Basil Rathbone) and The Wolf Man (1941), then you've already seen this done better, although those earlier efforts didn't have as much attention to detail on setting up a misty sense of doom.  (The misty doom was later used by director John Brahm with a beter script in The Lodger.)  It's sort of like seeing an early template for Hammer horror.  20th C. print on DVD is awesome, and it's nicely packaged with good language/subtitle options.  I'd recommend it as a curiosity piece for fans of pre-1950's era horror.",1310428800,2,758,4.875
3902627,4,B002C1GMYI,"without all of the fancy CGI, and other modern trappings, the masterful John Brahms manages to direct a creepy atmospheric classic thriller, that wraps the whole story up in a scant 110 minutes.

Using black and white film to create the look and feel of tension requires so much more art than modern digital effects.

What we have here is a good old fashioned who done it, only, with the premise that the ""who"" truly is a legendary monster, and like many great mysteries, there are red herrings galore to throw you off the path and create false suspicions.

This is tight little film making, with just the right amount of tongue in cheek to never get even slightly campy, yet also , just the right amount of seriousness.

Solid acting all around...this one truly has stood the test of time for those that are lucky to remember it, and can now relive it in DVD.",1310342400,11,860,4.493589743589744

3902629,4,B002C1GMYI,"Undying Monster 1942. This review is for the Blu Ray of the movie. This film was Fox's cash in on new revived horror cycle of the 40s. They released this movie and Dr. Renault's secret on a double bill.
The film itself is worth seeing and for the vintage horror collector a gem by the wonderful director John Brahm. But the film can be found in the collection of films called Fox Horror Classics with 2 other Brahm films.
The Blu Ray is no different in transfer than the 2008 release of the film in the collection. There is 2 commentaries on the Blu Ray that are not on the DVD version.
If you like commentaries than this version may be your cup of tea. I found them rather dull and flat. Tom Weaver has done better ones on other werewolf movies.
I really enjoy this movie and recommend the set over this version because of the price and the other 2 movies on the set make it a great deal",1487289600,,888,4.1988304093567255

was issued in a 3 DVD set back in 2007:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fox-Horror-Classics-Collection-The-Lodger-Hangover-Square-The-Undying-Monster/dp/B000TLTCT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fox Horror Classics Collection (The Lodger / Hangover Square / The Undying Monster)</a>
Now Kino Lorber is reissuing each of these films on Blu-Ray in HD black and white masters, AND they are including significant extras, which made my decision to upgrade a lot easier

""The Undying Monster"" is the only true horror film of the three.
Universal had a hit with ""The Wolf Man"" one year earlier, and Twentieth Century Fox basically ripped it off (one change: the human identity of the monster is kept secret until the end of the film).
We don't see the monster until the final ten minutes, though the original audience knew going in that we were dealing with a werewolf (see the 1942 movie poster below).
In the final scene, an expert explains that the monster was not really a werewolf, but instead a victim of lycanthropy.
Very scientific.
If only a spokesman had asked the audience to contribute money on their way out of the theater, we might today have a cure for this dread disease.

""The Lodger"" and ""Hangover Square"" are thrillers, or maybe even lurid melodramas.
Nothing supernatural, but Laird Cregar, who starred in both, could be a really scary lunatic.

Cool Things you learn from the ""The Undying Monster"" commentary tracks:

-- Freeze the picture at 6:21, then press slow motion.
For two seconds, you can clearly see the number ""13"" painted on a cloud (left third of the screen).
This is not a Message from God.
A prop man just forgot to erase the inventory number from the studio backdrop.

-- Wolf Man: ""Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright.""

-- Undying Monster: ""When stars are bright on a frosty night, beware thy bane on the rocky lane.""
This may be an inside joke.
James Ellison was cast as a Scotland Yard inspector despite his American accent.
He was better known as the cowboy hero of a series of B-movies.
""Rocky Lane"" was the name of a rival cowboy star at another studio
(audiences in 1942 would have known this).

-- Strudwick the chauffeur was the sceen debut of actor Charles McGraw (unbilled), who went on to star in a lot of film noir classics over the next fifteen years.

English SDH subtitles (the DVD also had an optional Spanish audio track, and French and Spanish subtitles, none of which are on the new Blu-Ray).
The new transfer is not perfect - there are still a lot of scratches that shouldn't be there, but the HD transfer reproduces twice as many shades of gray as the old DVD.

Fox was actually pretty generous with the extras back in 2007:
""The Lodger"" and ""Hangover Square"" each had a commentary track, and all three films had a generous selection of featurettes.
All the extras from 2007 have been carried over to the Blu-Rays, PLUS
-- ""The Undying Monster"" REVIEWED ON THIS PAGE now has TWO very well-done commentary tracks (versus none in 2007)
-- ""The Lodger""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lodger-Blu-ray/dp/B01LHBM4BI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lodger [Blu-ray</a>] also has TWO commentary tracks (one is carried over from 2007).
-- ""Hangover Square"" will probably also have two commentary tracks, but release of it has been delayed until later in 2017 (which actually confirms that Kino is going to the trouble of creating new HD masters for these films)

I have a twenty year collection of classic movies on DVD.
Many of them are now being reissued on Blu-Ray.
If cost were no issue, I'd replace all my old DVDs with the latest technology, but cost is an issue.
Color films from the 1950s and '60s would seem to benefit more from the improved resolution of Blu-Ray than ancient black and white classics from the '30s and '40s.

I have managed to replace a number of black and white Humphrey Bogart DVDs with Blu-Rays.
Plus I ordered the ""Complete Legacy"" sets of ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Wolf Man"" on Blu-Ray (Amazon Deal of the Day).
In every case, I was pleasantly surprised at the improvement in the black and white picture.
One thing that would make the decision easier would be if studios were to include additional bonus features that were not on the original DVD.
This is usually not the case, but there are exceptions.
These black & white films reissued on Blu-Ray came with a lot of extras (commentaries and featurettes) not on the original DVD:

3902631,5,B002C1GMYI,"An under-appreciated werewolf film here.  I can remember seeing this as a kid thinking that the werewolf would turn out to be some guy who only thought he was one.  Even though the dumb closing scene says this is the case, believe me, there is a really neat werewolf on screen.  I always felt like this was (along with RETURN OF THE VAMPIRE) the Universal horror that WASN'T a Universal horror.  Discovering this film way back in my youth was right up there with the time I stole home in little league!  My thanks will forever go out to that third baseman with the wild throw and to this film with the totally unexpected werewolf.
By the way, I can definitely see a big improvement over the DVD release with this Blu Ray edition.
