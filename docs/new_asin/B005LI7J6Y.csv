8478149,5,B005LI7J6Y,"Often, you see a movie and memory of it lasts for as long as the ticket remains in your pocket. Mobul is a different kind of a movie. It stays with you. The story is simple, but it is told in a way that makes you think about it for months. You believe every character, every word they say and you live their story with them, with your heart and your soul.

The beauty of scenery is incredible, even though it is filmed in the ordinary Israeli town. The scene on the beach makes the sea another actor, powerful in its silent and telling role.

Do not miss it. It does not offer a Hollywood-style happy ending, but rather a very optimistic and powerful accord.

I saw it two years ago at the film festival and to this day it is the most memorable film I saw since then.",1374624000,2,767,4.134228187919463

""The Flood"" (2011 release from Israel; 101 min.) brings the story of Yoni, an almost 13 yr. old boy in coastal Israel who is sudying hard for his upcoming Bar Mitzvah, while also trying to fit in at school with 'the cook kids'. His life and his parents' (his dad's pilot license is suspended due to drugs, and his mom is running a kids camp and having an affair with one of the kids' father) is thrown completely into turmoil when Yoni's older brother Tomer, who is autistic, is unexpectedly released from the hospital/instutition and due to shortages in other places has no choice but to be sent back home. How will the family adjust to Tomer's return? Will the dad get his pilot license back? Will everything go well with Yoni's Bar Mitzah? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, this is an intense and at times difficult to watch family drama that pulls no punches. But that only makes this movie even more worthwhile in the end. Second, kudos to Yoav Rotman who brings an outstanding performance in the role of Yoni. He very much reminds me of Fred Savage who was 12 when he started out in The Wonder Years. Third, the movie takes excellent advantage of the scenery in coastal Israel, it simply makes me want to revisit that beautiful country. Bottom line: this movie is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare but if you are in te mood for a quality foreign movie, ""The Flood"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1361577600,4,1686,4.506535947712418
