8458747,3,B0055SLB3C,"My favorite part of this film has got to be the way that Costa set up the well known shot--you can see it on youtube--where Balibar is framed with the neck of a guitar of a player in her ensemble.  Whether he realizes it or not, this is a direct visual quote by Costa from Jane Russell's and Robert Mitchum's ""His Kind of Woman""--the scene where Russell, who plays chanteuse Lenore Brent, is framed by the guitar of a Mexican guitarist.

It's a funny sort of ironic quote, given that Russell was a well known arch-conservative and Balibar has taken a stand against French government policy towards immigrants. Balibar's father, moreover, is a well known Marxist philosopher.  But then again, Russell did sing about ""San Berdoo,"" i.e. San Bernadino; and Balibar pere has taught at UC Irvine, which is not that far from San Berdoo.  So maybe there is a fun bit of cultural geography at play here.  Who knows.

Otherwise, this film, as I believe Straub told Costa, really does go for the obvious.

As Costa has said in an interview, for example, Balibar has ""lost so much.""  She can't keep up with the Offenbach.  She can't keep up with her voice coach either.

Costa frames her throughout this film to show her display much more grace than she seems to possess when she is featured on French television and in French cinema.  By enclosing her body tightly within the frame, you can't see her flail in this film like you can in such other contexts.  She evidently admires C Lombard, who, if anyone, was an exemplar of graceful, physical comedy.  But Balibar, unfortunately, hasn't been able to pull off such dexterity.

Costa seems a bit conflicted about Balibar as a muse.  He has contrasted her to I. Huppert inasmuch as Huppert, according to Costa, isn't the type of actress who would explore the urban area of Lisbon where Costa shot his Fontainhas trilogy.  Evidently Balibar is.

Still, Balibar has been known to frequent fashion week in Paris.  Let's hope she didn't wear such a fancy get up when she visited the poor in Lisbon with Costa.",1362873600,3,2043,4.659217877094972
