My Review:

 My family loves N Circle Entertainment and their magnificent creations. They have some of the educational movies for young children out there. Sid the Science Kid is a family favorite, as well. Sid is a little boy that always wants to know the how and why about the most simplest things. The latest season set is no different. In the Season 1 Volume 3 of Invent &Investigate Sid along with his friends learn about simple machines, how animals communicate and many, many more science related things that are utterly fascinating.

 Sid has so much going during this season. It is literally packed with Science goodness. It is a must have for your preschooler. Age range for this product is preschool and up. But our whole family enjoys Sid the Science Kid.

**Disclosure** This product was sent to me free of charge from N Circle Entertainment in exchange for my honest review.",1464739200,2,1524,4.816091954022989
