2897114,5,B000TGCR3I,"I saw Tekkon Kinkreet at a screening in the MOMA a few months back. I didn't not expect anything, but i was absolutely blown away by the end. The story, cinematography, the blending of drawn elements with the CG was breathtaking. This is a masterpiece that we all have been waiting for for years. This is Triplets of Belville on crack with all the wonderful funk that anime brings. An amazing movie!!!!!!",1190678400,3,404,4.625
2897115,2,B000TGCR3I,"Gorgeous production values.  Left of the middle character designs.  Fantastic music by Plaid.

Sadly, the plot of the movie quickly descends into the same metaphysical-pseudo-spiritual gobbledeegook that so many feature-length Japanese anime films pass off as high art storytelling.  The metaphors are contrived, sophomoric and paper thin.  Yet, Tekon kinkurto hammers its ""underlying"" themes into over our skull again and again as if it were wielding Black's signature iron pipe.

The movie is not wholly un enjoyable- the story of a down on his luck yakuza, turned expectant father Kimura, is much more compelling than the tale of Black and White and the film's only redeeming quality story and character-wise.  Sadly, Kimura is ushered out a good half hour before this mess of a story ends.

I cannot recommend this one, not by a long shot.  I'm really surprised at the positive reactions to this film.  Visually, it is impressive.  I love the music as well.  The story is a complete miss.  Perhaps others just want the visual entertainment.  Maybe they have their ""anime blinders"" on.  I watch movies for story and this movie doesn't deliver a good one.  I'm not alone in this either.  Check out the review over at Anime News Network for a review by Justin Sevakis who feels almost exactly the same about the film as myself.

I stand by my review.  Your time is better spent elsewhere.  Take a pass on Tekkon Kinkreet.",1190592000,18,1422,4.894957983193278
2897116,5,B000TGCR3I,"This is the film adaptation of what might be the best graphic novel I`ve ever read. There are no words to describe how much I love the original comic book so I attended the North American premiere of Tekkon Kinkreet at the Moma in NY with high expectations.
Not only did the movie not fail to meet them but in fact added exciting and unexpected layers to the story. I am an animator; I`m rarely satisfied with the technical aspects of most animated features but the production on Tekkon is flawless. The animation, character design, backgrounds and camera work are all top notch. The two main characters are rendered in all their complexity and the movie doesn't shy away from the deep implications that the original story holds within its pages.
The movie is faithful to the comic book and the storyline is basically the same. However, Michael Arias and studio 4C were sometimes inventive, albeit in appropriate and creative ways. The new uniforms of the three warriors that Snake sends to kill Black and White are beautiful and reminiscent of a Moebius illustration- the final confrontation between Black and the two remaining warriors is held in the amusement park instead of the car-shelter site (which makes room for new dynamic shots) - but my favorite shift from the original material has to be the minotaur sequence. A lot of people complained that the movie is not as daring as Mind Game (studio 4C`s previous adventure into full length features) but I disagree - the animation gets very experimental during the minotaur scene showing the thin line between reality and Black's violence saturated subconscious. I  loved the way they communicated the internal struggle by using the graphic language of animation alone.
Overall, Mind Game's pastiche of animation styles is probably more audacious but Tekkon more than compensates for it's more rigorous style with incredibly strong characters (MG characters came off as a little wacky at times) and a story that is so good that it hurts. If your eyes are not wet by the time Black and White get separated you are a soul-less fiend and you may want to consider a career in advertising.
I haven't been so excited about an anime since Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence hit the theaters; it's a shame that while it was one of the most important movies of the year in Japan, Tekkon Kinkreet got very limited distribution in Europe and in the US - so do yourself a favor and buy this DVD!",1190419200,53,2436,4.75886524822695
2897117,5,B000TGCR3I,"the minotaur is one of my favorite anime characters thus far.
i would recommend watching it in japanese and reading the captions since the characters speaking english really don't fit the emotive in quite the same way.",1495065600,,218,4.918918918918919

2897127,5,B000TGCR3I,"My all-time favorite animated movie. The style is quite unique and the story is outside the norm as well. It is a project of love based on the directors (who is American) most lived manga series. The English dub makes it seem like the youngest of the two protagonists is a boy because the story has some rather harsh moments (I guess it was more palatable to western audiences) but she is in fact a girl.

This tale of two homeless boys on the loose in a fantastical, prismatic, corrupted city is utterly engrossing and, on some levels, moving.

2897155,5,B000TGCR3I,"Tekkon Kinkreet is stunning and easily the best animated movie (I've seen) in years. It has the vibrancy and surrealism of Paprika, the emotional intensity and violence of Evangelion, with the urban action sequences and complex cityscapes of Akira. Of course it is not a simple mish-mash but has a character all its own and emphasizes on the need to have a place called home and people that are family.",1444262400,,402,4.757142857142857

The animation is fantastic, but as a Japanese film, it does not follow the Western way of story-telling, which this one time just didn't work for me.

At that point, I had only seen a couple of anime films, and did not expect much from a bargain bin buy. I was wrong. I'm not over exaggerating when I say that this has to be one of the very best anime's ever made. The movie is based off of a manga series, and it rings true to the original story and style. It plays off the idea of yin and yang, that dark and light balance each other out. It is beautifully done through the eyes of two orphan children, who live on the streets of a regular town with a growing crime problem.

2897194,3,B000TGCR3I,"Bizarre.  Grotesque.  Confusing.  A year in the lives of two street kids.  The story involves the attempt from several factions to take over the metropolis of Takaramachi.  What follows is a vicious struggle for supremacy.  The violence escalades at an alarming pace, ending in a strange LSD-like finale that can only be described as a freak-out montage of horror and torment.  This is one of the most depressing animated features I've ever seen.  But at the same time, it is also captivating.  The background artwork is fabulously detailed, while the characters are purposely unattractive, creepy looking people in a creepy looking city doing creepy things to one another.  If this was meant as social commentary, then it's magnificent.  If not, then it's just brutality for the sake of shock value.

It's about the love between two brothers, each embodying a side of us that we all have, each vastly different from the other, and coming together to represent a whole.
Black and White need each other in such an inherent way that when strife, struggle and separation toggles the fibers of their relationship... we witness one of their souls collapse. It's dark, beautifully draw (characters are simple but the environments.. love love love) and emotionally fulfilling.

These dumb street kids do one stupid thing after another and magically don't get killed - even when one kid gets stabbed through the belly with a giant sword and bleeds a huge puddle of blood. The plot seems to be making them do progressively more moronic things. And in a manipulative way, we're supposed to think they're cute and pure.

Complex characters literally jump off the screen at you; interwoven story lines, typical of the genre, do not disappoint; beautiful, thoughtful and truly appropriate music underscores the entire work. I tried to find the OST to no avail, but will keep looking...it's just that good.

First off, the setting... Treasure City.  I love all of the Hindu deities and symbols present throughout this gorgeous production.  The whole city is a wonderful spectacle full of brilliant, vibrant colors.

The two stars of this production--Black and White--make an interesting family... White is definitely one the most unique characters from any anime I've seen.  Black is trying to take care of White and the city by any means necessary, and White is there helping Black keep it together (in his own way).  As White says during one scene with the police, ""I have all the screws Black needs.""

If you like watching anime that really stands out as being spectacular, you won't go wrong with Tekkonkinkreet.  Beautiful art, spectacular animation, and interesting characters all come together to create this masterpiece.",1345075200,,1058,4.898876404494382

Tekkon Kinkreet has that gift, whether its you feeling the love the two boys share for each other or the pain they've gone through you become connected to them that when the movie ends you feel like you where right there with them.

2897231,5,B000TGCR3I,"This story is about 2 youths growing up in a city that has somehow escaped the progress of civilization called Treasure Town named Black and White. They are 2 delinquents who survive by commiting crime and have no family. Obviously, the characters are opposites, but at the same time totally complementary, as each one has was the other one is lacking.

The basic premis of the story is a new Mob Gang is moving into town, and Black and White do what they can to stop it.

There are some ""magical"" elements to the movie, but presented so well that you won't question the realism, but you will just wonder where it comes from. The story does not give you tons of backstory for each character, but most viewers can fill in the blanks themselves, and it adds to the entire production in my opinion.

The movie has an aggressive feel to it, but also peaceful at the same time. I recomend it for a more mature cerebral viewer. Most teenie bopper anime crazed kids probably won't get it, or be able to appreciate the unique art style. With that said, you do not need to be an anime fan to enjoy this.

The one complaint I have is the final scene... its drawn out about 5 minutes too long. I know its the important, climatic moment but it kills the flow of the entire film. Outside of this, its perfect.

I only watched the English version, and felt all the actors did an exceptional job - especially with White.",1325289600,,1405,4.388461538461539

2897239,3,B000TGCR3I,"This film is about two street kids Black and White who live in the rundown Treasure Town. Black, the oldest of the boys spend his time taking care of White and beating up anyone endangering his city. Soon the young boys life are disrupted when a Yakuza gang moves in and tries to take over the city. Things are complicated further when the Yakuza brings in a strange looking and brutal man who may be an alien. The story of this movie however is not about the Yakusa, or about aliens or even about White's seaming psychic abilities, it is about the relationship between these two boys, and how the world looks more interesting when one are a child.

I found the story to artsy for my tastes, also it is very uneven, at some points it is a slice of life depicting the lives of two street children, then it is science fiction with aliens, then we are in a gangster film and then we have a Spiritual battle for one of the character's soul. The movies is all over the place, some might like this, I do not. The characters however are well made, one start to care about these characters, and everyone, including supporting characters are given a distinctive personality and a unique look.

The animation of this film is very good, the film obviously have high production value and everything moves, not like in many anime where only the character's lips moves most of the time. The scenes are very detailed and while I personally did not care for the art style and found the movie frankly to be quite ugly I have to take my hat off to the animators as the movie is skillfully made.

I watched the movie with Japanese dialog and English subtitles, I was not impressed, the actors all sounded monotone. The dub might be better I do not know, but the sub at least was not good enough to carry such complex and involving characters.

Personally I did not like this film. I think that the movie was far to long, it moved very uneven with long sections where nothing happens and a very confusing storyline. I however have to give the movie credit for being well made, for having great characters and for being a little different compared to most anime movies.",1292544000,2,2148,4.458015267175573

About 6 months ago,for whatever reason,I watched it again,and with this third viewing I finally realized what a masterpiece Tekkonkinkreet really is. With every viewing since then,I seem to become more and more involved in the story,the characters,and the themes presented throughout. The music by Plaid adds subtlety to some of the most memorable scenes.
Black's struggle between the light and the darkness is made crucial by the development of the two boys and their interactions with each other and their environment-the resolution of that struggle produces,for me,an almost euphoric feeling;in the moment when the two make contact after having been separated to face their internal realities I invariably tear up and get a chill down my spine...
This masterpiece truly gets better with each viewing. For anime fans with appreciation of more than constant action and who possess an inner sense of what really matters in life,this little gem is surely a must-have film.",1266278400,2,1162,5.1534391534391535

2897251,3,B000TGCR3I,"From a technical standpoint I think TK sets a very high standard, however the story and directing dips dangerously close to ""Animu"" in a few areas; unnecessary scenes that feel spliced in just to explain the story, too much time spent developing characters we don't really care about, and characters who occasionally ""overact"".  In short, it feels too formulamatic.  I blame this largely on the director, Michael Arias; for the life of me I'll never understand how he came to head a project like this.

Studio4C has, in my opinion, the most talented collection of animators on the planet at it's disposal.  Koji Morimoto, Masaaki Yuasa, Shinichiro Watanabe, all fantastic artists with unique visions and talents.  This film is definitely worth watching, even owning, if only for the masterful compositing and design.  However, I'm disappointed in the way the movie flows and how the story is told; I expected something more unique from Studio4C.

Though it hasn't been released in the west, try to find Mind Game (or to a lesser extent Genius Party) if you want to see what Studio4C is capable of.  The beauty of the message of Mind Game moved me to tears, and similarly Yuasa's short in Genius Party said more about human life and death in 15 minutes than most movies accomplish in hours.",1238112000,2,1289,4.853881278538813

It's truly, truly baffling why Sony does this to legitimate, paid for DVD's.  I have a hard time convincing myself not to buy bootleg DVD's that work better, everywhere, at a third of the price.

  I have since figured out how to play this movie on my computer and the irony of it will keep me entertained well into my sunset years.

The plot is extremely empty and even childish, about 2 adolescent boys, orphans I think, who sleep in the street and make a living from theft.  Yet they think they are protectors of the city and the elder one is particularly good in martial art, and both boys can jump up high buildings with bare foot.  It's like listening to the story of a kid that makes you laugh.

Yet the artwork is astounding to the effect that I just forget about the characters or what their are doing and focus to appreciate the surrounding artwork, like you enterd an art gallery, you would not mind whether the doorkeeper is decent in look but care about the paintings only. The artwork just make that from Disney or Pixar look pale and poor in details.

One drawback is that all characters are drawn roughly, including the two boys, like blackspots on a perflect painting.

His struggle with some of the animation sequences, and solutions... my only wish was to have dedicated a short period of time on how they went about the work with the voice actors, which I thought was great.

This was based on the Manga Black and White. I have to say I was a little disappointed in this one. I enjoyed in, but it left a gaping whole where I wanted closure. The art style is unique to say the least. The action is brutal, yet subtle. The story is barely even a major factor. This movie is more based off the relationship between Black and White. It obviously is a symbolic representation of Yin and Yang; you must have both to function correctly.

Black and White are kids known as the Cats on the streets of Treasure Town. Treasure Town is an extremely undeveloped town, run mostly by the Yakuza. Black and White usually cause havoc while trying to protect their territory and there town. Black is a serious warrior. He develops well throughout the course of our story. At first he is fighting to protect White, but soon we see he has his own demons. White is a slow child. White doesn't do much except act weird. For some reason, he has ""all the screws Black needs."" You will find out what that means through the course of the movie.

A new boss takes his place at the top of the Yakuza. He demands that Treasure Town be reborn in his image. He wants amusement parks, casinos, and other moneymaking machines to flood Treasure Town. Obviously, this does not sit well with our ally dwellers, Black and White. Black causes chaos for the Yakuza, which causes them to sent giant super-human type men after them. White is almost killed by one of them and eventually taking away from Black. Black oddly enough, falls to his demons and allows for White to leave. I will leave the rest of the plot to your observational skills.

The plot may sound thick, but it isn't as deep as one might think. There is another whole side-story with a man named Rat, a Yakuza member, being caught up in the new plan for the city. He hates it, but knows he can do nothing about it. That story plays a less significant role though. The main picture is more of a man VS himself type plot. Black needs White to keep him in balance. Can Black defeat his demons and return to White? That is the basic concept of the entire movie. I like this idea, but a dense story in the background didn't help this movie out.

The art in this movie is great. Everything looks very detailed, except for the actual people. The people have a styles all of their own. They are less detailed, but have a certain appeal to them. This was probably one of my favorite art styles I have seen so far.

The extras on this one are a commentary track and a few other small things. There is nothing that I really felt was worth looking at. The film has a great theme, that you need to keep yourself balanced, but a thin story brings this one down for me. The Yakuza wasn't even really part of the main plot, so their existence felt almost meaningless to me.",1219017600,2,2824,4.351043643263757
2897259,4,B000TGCR3I,"Based on a Japanese manga and created by a Japanese studio, yet written and directed by Americans, this movie still doesn't lack authenticity like I was worried that it might. The story it tells is fairly universal, focusing on the bond of brotherhood.

The 2 main characters, White and Black (friendS? brothers? the movie never really makes it clear) live in Treasure Town, a very vibrant city that's easily one of the most amazing things I've seen in animation. Yet this city, despite looking like a huge playground, is actually a bit of a wreck, where gangs fight for control and where crime is rampant. The first half of the story focuses on Black and White's bonds and their life as the Cats, the gang that owns the city. The second half features a new mob boss entering and attempting to gain control with his alien cohorts who seem nearly invincible.

The movie does lose a bit of interest as it beings to verge into the supernatural (those alien things really didn't fit in at all, I didn't think,) and the resolution, involving, like many anime's, a trip inside of the head of the main character, may leave mixed feelings on some viewers. The pacing's a little off as well...the first half may be too slow for some while the 2nd half doesn't ever really stop with the action and the chase scenes, which may wear some down. Still, we have a great anime here where the city's the star of the show. Somehow my favorite scene in the movie takes place during the second half of the credits, where you simply see shots of the city as a song from the Asian Kung-Fu Generation plays in the background. It's an amazing setting and even though it was only made for 5 million dollars, it looks, to me, much better than most hundred-million+ CG movies made today. It's not perfect (Despite the R-rating it seems to play it a bit safe at times...Black never seems to kill his rival gangsters even though the script and direction seems to act like he does,) but it's definitely a movie worth seeing. The first half hour in particular is just stunning.

Note; there IS an option for an English dub on the disc. The director (in interviews) has actually recommended the English dub, and while I don't agree with him, I will say that it's much better than the dubs you find in most anime. That said, though, a lot of the dialogue (especially White's) seems extremely corny when spoken aloud in English...and overall it does dampen the story a bit, so I'd recommend the Japanese language with subtitles. If you MUST hear it in English, at least you can be assured that the performances are good and it actually fits fairly well.",1215820800,,2619,4.568085106382979

""Tekkon Kinkreet"" is a sporadically engaging, though frequently confusing, anime gangster film from director Michael Arias.  The story, based on the comic book by Taiyo Matsumoto, focuses on two homeless orphans, one named Black and the other White, who live on the streets of Treasure Town, a seething cauldron of criminality, vice and corruption.  Black fancies himself a superhero crime-fighter, while White, who is given to extrasensory knowledge and visions, dreams of one day moving away from the city and getting a home of their own on the beach.  Thanks to Black's insistence on taking on the bad guys, both youngsters get caught up in a turf war between the Yakuza and some robot-like killers who are duking it out for ownership of the city.

Fans of anime will find much to enjoy in this film, which is marked by beautifully detailed urban landscapes, exciting action and chase sequences, occasional lyrical flights into fantasy, and a sometimes touching tale about commitment and friendship centered on the two young boys.  On the other hand, the plethora of characters and occasional narrative incoherence can make it difficult at times to understand what exactly is going on, particularly when the story takes a decidedly metaphysical turn (with imagery taken straight out of ""Contact"") in the final half hour.  Still, the visuals alone make it worth a gander.",1215820800,2,1381,5.111111111111111

This story is kind of hard to explain. It's basically of two young boys living by themselves in the big city in the poorest part of town. They are orphans. One older than the other. The older one looking after the young one. It's very depressing and sad through most of the story. Kind of reminds me of the mood in ""Grave of the Fireflys"". A lot of violence as you could imagine.
The art work in this is as good as I've seen. Beautiful coloring. You cannot look away it's so good. And the creativity that went into the story along with the art is the best it can be.
All I can say is you have to see for yourself. Give it a try. I think you'll like it.

2897263,4,B000TGCR3I,"I truly enjoyed this film. Tekkon Kinkreet is one of those films that can be watched over and over again and is definitely a lot deeper than first appearances show. Treasure Town is presented as an amalgamation of diverse peoples and ideas, a natural juxtaposition of images and contexts. The subsurface story of the film deals with a base duality of light and dark that is echoed throughout the film, an exploration of ideological contrast and dependency inside of a morally ambiguous surrounding context. The structure of the story is somewhat simple, but thankfully the content is joyfully and cohesively complex.

Saying all that, I do have some reservations about the film. As I mentioned earlier, the story is a bit cut and dry for me, though I do feel that the characters and the complexity of the symbolism make up for that somewhat. The ideological anthropomorphism of the ""nature of progress"" subplot was a little simplistic, a possible consequence of the secondary animal identification of certain characters within that particular context. This symbolic layering and its effect on character interaction is a fun thing to watch play out, but sometimes the foreshadowing could get a little bit thick.

Overall, Tekkon Kinkreet was a great watch. I totally recommend it.",1212710400,,1279,5.085714285714285

I don't know what to say, except this: You'll enjoy this film even if you watch it with the volume down, because, visually, this is like tapestry. Every inch of the screen will give you something interesting to look at. It's like Hieronymus Bosch in LSD. Now, when it comes to the narrative, it goes from dramatic to fantastic to poetic in seconds. My friend's reference to Kitano has to do with the way this film pays homage even to yakuza movies.

2897266,5,B000TGCR3I,"Associating this unique bit of animation to ""Akira"" or ""Ghost In The Shell"" is misleading. While it is ""made by"" the same folk who did ""The Animatrix"", ""Tekkon kinkreet"" stands alone with it's unique subject matter and presentation. It is akin to a dream. There are elements in the film that suggest this:

1) Both Black and White can ""float"" (as well as the ""Alien"" Assassins sent to kill them).
2) Looking through White's eyes, it IS hard to delineate reality, especially near the end.
3) Some laws of physics don't seem to apply in Treasure Town.

Within all this IS a good story, however. There seems to be no ""gray"" area anywhere in the film. Things are very clear-cut: Good and Bad, Black and White, see where I'm going with this? The film becomes a bit surreal at times, but there is never a point at which you might say ""what's happening?"" The separation of Black and White also becomes representative of what happens when those two ""colors"" are removed from the rainbow.

This film is quite good. It is not made in the fashion of American ""beat-you-in-the-head-till-you're-numb"" sort of fare. It's a film to sit back and relax with. It IS ""R"" rated, which precludes certain members of the family from seeing it, but it is not a children's film, anyway (as one may be swayed into thinking, because of it's style of animation).

The DVD has the ubiquitous extras, a making of feature, conversations with the Director and the band that contributed some music for the film, and last but not least, film commentary.",1206230400,3,1519,4.677902621722846
2897267,5,B000TGCR3I,"This film was recommended to me, and it took me a while to get to a store where I could rent it for the first time. Then shortly following the rental I felt I needed to buy it and watch it a hundred more times. I sat at my computer paying close attention to even the tiniest details. This film is all about precision (See the special features- 300 day documentary about the making).

First, this film is about two orphan boys living in a crumbling town called ""Treasure Town."" The focus is all about perspective and how one views the world. While Kuro (Black) has a very dark possessive view of his home town, one that he thinks should never be changed, while Shiro (White) has an imagination and an eye for how the world really should be.

The two are endlessly dogged by the Yakuza who want want to change the town into an amusement park (among other things) and make a profit. Kuro fights to preserve ""My Town"" and keep it a place that he can always be the top of and see everything from. Like many other people he wants to keep a sense of security. The world turns upside down with its inner workings and everything in the real town seems so superficial that world and dreams of Shiro seem the most logical option for surviving.

The precise colors, time taken for each shot is clearly expressed, nothing in this film is ever missed, all the work is clear cut and every single scene has its meaning.

Kuro and Shiro share a lonely life living in broken down car and living off stolen money and goods. Although Kuro lives to care for his friend, he has his reservations about how care free Shiro is and that Shiro doesn't entirely like the way the town is developing. The conflicting feelings and various lenses that they see this world from is amazing.

I sat back after seeing this and thought it was an intense but completely necessary violent movie about two kids who just don't want their childhood world to be shattered by the adults. So many themes, ideas, and undertones play into this film that it's open to all viewers.

The time, effort, and thought put into this 111 minute film is clear. The sync of the musical score by Plaid and incredible ending sound by Asian Kung Fu Generation and the bizzare world by Mr. Arias makes me want to go be a director, he did an amazing adaptation of ""Black and White"" and transformed it into something else entirely with more graphic images and characters that you don't want to ever forget.

If you liked Akira, Steamboy, or like strange, abstract, but intricately woven films, this is the top of the list, and is good for a group of friends or personal viewing. This deserves a 10 out of 5!",1204329600,2,2643,4.425925925925926

The psychological aspects rival Hitchcock. Yin-Yang symbolisms are woven throughout the story, which seemingly ebs and flows with a superbly written and produced soundtrack. And the animation . . . well, you've got to see it three times to fully capture and appreciate the exquisite breadth, beauty and detail of the art.

If this isn't impressive enough, this is the director's debut. Of course he had the help of some of the very best producers in Japan; but to successfully convey ideas and orchestrate the hundreds of artists necessary to complete this project under a tight schedule, for even an experienced director, is nothing short of amazing.

For the few who were bored and gave the movie less than 4 stars, it is understandable. Great art is never appreciated by all.

2897277,5,B000TGCR3I,"I am so frequently disappointed by the Anime I purchase that Tekkonkinkreet was a total breath of fresh air. For starters the animation absolutely blew me away. It's a seamless blending of traditional and computer generated animation but you can't really tell where one ends and the other begins. You kinda have to see it to understand but it looks stunning when the camera pans around the city. I might compare the backgrounds to Metropolis released about five years ago. The people are drawn in a very simplistic manner which contrasts in an interesting way with the unbelievably detailed and complex landscapes.

It's in the story where most Anime fall apart. Generally the problem for me isn't so much that the stories are bad but that they are completely forgettable. Even a classic like Akira had a pretty paper thin plot. Tekkonkinkreet, on the other hand, will likely be difficult to forget in fact it's rather haunting. It's the story of two young street kids named Black and White. They are the epitome of Japanese Yin and Yang. Polar opposites who need each other for balance and when events pull them apart the balance is throw off and violence ensues.

What I love about Tekkonkinkreet is how different it is from anything I've seen before and how I felt an actual emotional attachment towards the two boys. I really hoped the movie would give them a happy ending (I won't reveal the outcome). Another cool thing about Anime unlike American animation is the moral ambiguity of the characters. Ironically a movie based on the Manga Black and White isn't so black and white. Even a member of the Yakuza can do something brave, almost heroic. This isn't a movie for children. There is quite a bit of violence which may surprise people given the whimsical cover but it is a great movie and clearly deserving of all the acclaim and film awards it has received.",1198713600,3,1868,4.7446153846153845

It is many-layered, and each viewing turned up more and more understanding and stronger feelings. I probably have yet to get all its metaphors and references; but I could feel them. It's the most elegantly-done anime I've ever seen; the most-sophisticated yet most essential, accessible and memorable.

Viewers of any age or background will enjoy and benefit from it.
It's art, really, perhaps starting a whole new movie genre.

(My appreciation/enthusiasm for this film makes me sound as if I'm raving, high on something; if so, it's this movie. However, whenever, you can see it, see it.

(Tekkonkinkreet is a classic. 2007 had PAPRIKA, which I think is a fine effort; but, Tekkonkinreet has a universal sensibility as well as the most well- done graphics. But because of this anime, 2007 will be seen as a turning point.

(When I graduated high school in (glerk!) 1958, my year-book class prophesy was I'd be seen putting Walt Disney out of business in 20 years.

1)  Visually speaking this movie is Beautiful and a ""Must Have"" if you want to show off your High Definition Entertainment center/system. The video is mastered in 1080p and simply looks beautiful on either LCD or Plasma via HDMI. The special features are also  in High Definition. I found the colour qualities to be extremely vibrant. In HD, depth of field is evident, noticeable and welcomed. Audio is 5.1 PCM uncompressed and nicely channelized, anyone with a good receiver and speakers system will, more likely than not, be very pleased. I found visitors, periodically turning their heads to their side expecting something to pop out of the wall.

Be warned, the story's presentation, on the surface, is a bit eclectic (Morphic Gen-X, to make up a term) but with some thought and explanation the film is extremely accessible, at least to anyone with a pulse. Even without explanation, I found the film thought provocative. Even my guy and gal friends, who aren't really into anime, were left with the proverbial, ""Huh?"" but at the same time were intrigued, ""Wow""ed and couldn't stop talking about the film.

It's a great film, a nice Blu-Ray piece, and great Anime experience. Just my 2.",1194307200,4,1478,4.799212598425197

2897286,4,B000TGCR3I,"This DVD glues you to the screen.  I was particularly interested in the character of White and how the child at times seems simple-minded, just being a child, joyful, insane, depressed and near the end during his separation from Black almost has extra-sensory perception to be able to see events happening to Black in a different place.  It was most interesting.  Black also goes through many emotional phases from warrior, to acrobat, to child protector, to emotionally lost.  The character of Kimura also becomes quite moving.  The scene where he has to shoot his mentor is touching.  The animation goes from making us feel like we're on a Tokyo street to the wildly fantastic.  The climactic carnival sequence with fire and blood is breathtaking.  This is an engaging story and DVD, well worth viewing.  Enjoy!",1193270400,3,813,4.962962962962963

2897288,4,B000TGCR3I,"I'm usually a person that has to see an anime, in any of its forms, before I buy it. I bought Tekkon Knkreet blind, and I am happy with my decision. Going into it, I knew it would be visually amazing from the trailers I saw when it was released in Japan. What I wasn't prepared for was a deep, emotional story that really pulled me in. The story deals with friendship, brotherhood, loss, the inexplicable, insanity, differing visions, and overall fighting for what you love and believe in. Even if you aren't a big fan of Japanese animation, but can take animation, and have an imagination, I definitely recommend checking out this title.",1192924800,5,638,4.605263157894737
2897289,1,B000TGCR3I,"It was a nicely done anime. But the blur between reality and imagination makes this movie a hard one to follow. I was left wondering, what was the conflict, and did it get resolved? Or are they day dreaming? There was nothing finite to it. What made the movie so highly acclaimed is still a mystery.",1192838400,11,299,4.357142857142857
2897290,5,B000TGCR3I,"HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN since your imagination and heart has been captured by a film? If it's been a while, check out ""Tekkonkinkreet"" (""Treasure Town"") from first time director Michael Arias. This is animation for adults at its best. Visuals are striking, the sound dynamic and genuine, characterization is breathtaking - but you will have to bring along your imagination.

Old city citizens, especially those who long to preserve the historic areas of their town, might find a touchstone here. The complex story is based on a manga (graphic novel series) from Taiyo Matsumoto that Arias picked up when he moved to Japan some 17 years ago. The central theme deals with change and how a long established city, such as Tokyo, cannot expand except by tearing down its old structures and neighborhoods. As Arias roamed his new city, he would frequently chance onto a beloved building demolished for new construction.

Arias, who has worked in film - primarily creating computer graphics for films like ""The Abyss,"" ""Animatrix"" and ""Princess Mononoke"" - said it was ""Tekkonkinkreet"" that moved him to step into the director's position.

The story evolves around the brilliantly colorful ghetto world of two orphaned street brothers, Black and White. Black is the smart, older kid, a survivor intent on taking care of the younger child, White. White is a special charmer, lost in a much younger child's dream world. A developer, Mr. Snake, plans to demolish Treasure Town to build a theme park along the scale of Disneyland or Busch Gardens. He allies with the local yakuza to accomplish this, creating a rift between a profit-loving godfather and a traditional mobster who loves the neighborhood. A pair of sympathetic detectives and other street folk help and hinder as ""Treasure Town"" unfolds.

Those used to the superb animation of Miyazaki, will find the Matsumoto's images, handled by animation director Mashiko Kubo, quite different and no less compelling. ""Tekkonkinkreet"" is an amazing blend of CGI and traditional hand-drawn art. It's beautifully complex with sharp detail and vibrant color. As for sound, it is simply amazing. The streets are alive, the soundtrack and voices are perfect. Do yourself a favor and watch this in Japanese with English subtitles. This brilliant, beautiful film slipped by us in its theatrical release. Don't miss it in on DVD. - Kay Reynolds, The Virginian-Pilot",1191974400,7,2395,5.117647058823529
2897291,5,B000TGCR3I,"If you like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akira-Special-Edition/dp/B00005MAM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akira (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-in-the-Shell/dp/6304493681/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost in the Shell</a>, and thought they were true masterpieces despite their ambiguous style of storytelling, then you'll love Tekkon Kinkreet. It's as true an anime as there ever was: it follows its own style of storytelling, it has interesting, even endearing characters, and the art is just beautiful. It sits comfortably next to some of the best anime ever to come to the States.

Tekkon Kinkreet follows two young boys, known around the city as the Cats, but to each other they are Black and White. Black is a brooding, violent youngster with a gift for taking pain and dishing it out. White is, simply, special; he's empathic, enjoys life, and has a deep sense of when things aren't right. He also seems to be magically gifted. That gift, however, has left White an innocent boy, incapable of growing up and acting his age; that's why Black feels obligated to protect the young boy, and the that means eliminating any possible threat to him and White, as well as the city in which they live. Thus, these two have a few enemies, including the Yakuza, some strange and powerful alien assassins, and a mysterious creature known by the youth in the city as the ""Minotaur."" All the while, the two are continually robbing and mugging those within their city so that they can achieve White's dream of living in a house on a beach....

Yeah, interesting, I know. But what makes the story of Tekkon Kinkreet that much better is the surreality of the whole thing. It doesn't try to explain much; it doesn't have to. White and Black can run at tremendous speeds and leap ten feet into the air; aliens exist; and a boy has the power to link himself mentally to his best friend. Why? Because they do.... And all the while, it's as fantastically believable as a well told fantasy novel.

Outside of that, the art and characters of Tekkon Kinkreet helps to drive the story along. The settings contains so much detail that it's impossible to find anything. If this was a ""Where's Waldo"" drawing, you'd never find him. The character art is also beautiful, reminiscent of the short sequence in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill-Volume-1/dp/B00005JMEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill, Volume 1</a>.

Now, for the one drawback (which many older anime fans wouldn't even consider as a drawback): this will be a very difficult anime for a new-comer to get into. The story isn't difficult to follow, but it can be confusing and the ending leaves a lot unanswered, as is the won't of anime. Still, though, if you have some experience with anime, then you won't be disappointed. The art is beautiful, the story is engaging, and the characters are endearing. I'd rate it higher if it were possible. Tekkon Kinkreet is definitely one of the best anime ever.",1191715200,26,3114,5.467775467775468

TekkonKinkreet was a visually a beautiful movie and also incredibly boring. I sat through the entire thing in hopes that it was going to get better however it never happened. I'm surprised by all the positive buzz surrounding this film. Im sure others will praise it but for me it was a snoozefest.,1191628800,9,446,4.385542168674699

I personally saw this film as a giant leap in Anime.  It has unbelievable action and yet it remains a very human story.  It is emotional yet gritty and tough.  I enjoyed the characters White (Shiro) and Black (Karo) and their duality.  It was a modern tale of taoist wizardry with a street edge that is rarely seen in this type of feature.  The backrounds are a primary character as well.  I have never seen such attention to detail in any amimation period.  Worth every penny.",1190937600,15,634,5.019230769230769
2897296,4,B000TGCR3I,"Firstly, don't be fooled by the lighthearted cover.  This isn't a children's movie.

Secondly, it takes a bit of time to get used to.  The backgrounds are gorgeous and rivals the detailing of the best of Disney.  But the character rendering reminded me of the old Nickelodeon animated series, ""The Wild Thornberrys"" which is to say, the character designs are very unique.

Thirdly, the opening 30 minutes is slow going and somewhat confusing.

But give it some time and then the story of Kuro and Shiro starts to really come together.

This is a fable of sorts in which the dark and the light need each other but one doesn't have to get too philosophical to get the message.

I agree with the previous reviewer who mentions the side story of Kimura.  That is one of the nice touches.  I'd also add the interaction of the cops, Sawada and Fujimura, with Shiro as another nice touch.

I gave it 4 starts because there is a wait time before it gets to the grist of the story and I stopped watching the clock.  But once I got past that point, I got into the story and by the end, I'd found that I enjoyed it a lot.",1190851200,4,1110,4.334951456310679

8208879,5,B000TGCR3I,"A difficult-to-summarize story of two orphan heroes swept up in the turmoil of the urban development transforming their retro-future town, TEKKONKINKREET shows us the importance of humanconnection, of choosing love and friendship over a solitary path ofdestruction, and thevalue of innocence and hope over corruption and cynicism. This movie shares DNA with Fellini's LA STRADA, Kurosawa's DODES KADEN, Imamura's PIGS AND BATTLESHIPS, and perhaps even Steinbeck's OF MICE AND MEN (to name just a few humanist masterworks).
