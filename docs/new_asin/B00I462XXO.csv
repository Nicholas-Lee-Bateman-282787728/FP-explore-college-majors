6249551,5,B00I462XXO,"A great series. I haven't played the game, but I've seen how closely this series follows it. Very funny, dramatic,  action packed.  Good for anyone who wants to experience Persona 4 without playing the game.",1411257600,,207,4.885714285714286
6249552,4,B00I462XXO,"Personally for the price I wish they were blu-ray DVDs, but it is nice to own the collection. FYI this is NOT for persona 4 GOLDEN, it was for the original persona 4 so things sound and look different. I never got a chance to play the original so this was my way of experiencing it and it wasn't too bad. I love the theme songs.",1411171200,2,328,3.984848484848485
6249553,4,B00I462XXO,"It's an amazing compilation for the series, even if you aren't a huge fan like me. The package is very well designed, and the box to.

I made the mistake with the DVD Zone. I live in Chile, so my PS3 and PS4 only accepts DVD's for Zone 4, but this collection is Zone 1. If it was a Blu ray version, i wouldn't have any problem.",1409443200,,327,3.8805970149253732

6249555,5,B00I462XXO,I love this series! Its so funny! I played the game and fell in love with the characters a few months ago and now that I have watched the animation I went back and played it again immediately! Great series and It was in english which was great!!!!,1408579200,,247,4.166666666666667

6249557,5,B00I462XXO,"Yu is going to the small town of Inaba to live with his uncle and cousin for a year as his parents are working overseas and he is not expecting much out of it.  But when a dead body of a local celebrety is found hanging off a house TV antenna, he is drawn into the mystery of the Midnight Channel and the powers that will awaken within him.  Can he and the rest of the Investigation Team figure out what is going on, before they are taken off the air - Permenantly......

I have the original two part set, and watched it both in Japanese and English languages.  The characters are enjoyable and easy to watch (I just finished the game and watching this first kind of gave me a small edge in what to expect).  A fan for anyone who like the Persona series, and of course I suggest watching Persona 4 Golden to see Marie and some of the things that happen between the main story.",1406764800,,876,4.159763313609467
6249558,4,B00I462XXO,Finally a dual languages and complete set together. Now I just hope they have this in Blu-Ray.,1406678400,,94,4.588235294117647

6249560,5,B00I462XXO,"This Complete set of Persona 4 is Awesome! I'm very impressed with the case that holds all 4 discs on dvd. The color and characters on the discs look like they could last forever. This in my opinion is the set to get if you want the slim collectors item.
Pros
-If you haven't gotten around to playing the game then this is the shorter version of that and that's convenient:)
-The slim but well made dvd case houses your dvds perfectly and the case front and back covers rock!
-the characters, animation, and story of this anime adaptation is spot on and enjoyable
-Its In English, Japanese with subtitles,and Japanese commentaries with Subtitles.

Cons
-if you've already beaten the game then this will be a rehash of what you've already experienced

Well hope you guys enjoy this anime as much as I have PEACE!",1405036800,4,811,4.586206896551724
6249561,3,B00I462XXO,"So i added this to a list when it was like 70+$. I looove Persona 4 but I couldn't justify the price tag. So i kept it on my list hoping it'd go down enough for me to obtain one day.
 Just a few days ago it went way down in peice and i was so excited xD!
Finally i can buy these dvds and just in time for my birthday. But then i tried to purchase them and now i guess only prime members can buy them...so id gave to pay 100$ + whatever they coust now... Its just super upsetting. I don't buy enough to make the 100$ for prime worth my money. But i still buy cool things here and there and the fact i can't get a set of dvds because i don't wanna pay into somthing i won't actually use is sad.
Ik thats how they try to get you to buy prime membership but come on...its not gonna force me to do it, it just makes me like the service less.",1496448000,,836,3.7231638418079096
6249562,5,B00I462XXO,"I've played the game when it first came out when I learned there was an anime of course I had to watch it and own it. Though it sticks fairly close to the events of the original game it does make a few changes. The protagonist actually has a voice and is a bit more sure of himself then he starts out in the game. It's very funny at times with the interactions between the characters. At other times it can be very heartfelt and touching. It can also be thrilling and at times a bit scary. Even if you didn't play the game one can easily enjoy this anime.

The dub I believe to be well done and matched the characters. It blew through the game rather quickly but still touched on the main points of the game though a bit more rushed which is fine. You wouldn't want to drag it out with putting it all in there and what they decided to do is pure gold.

It's about a boy who moves to a new town for a year to stay with his uncle and his niece. When he gets to this small town all seems normal, but then stranger murders start happening. As it progresses he soon makes 6 friends and they find there is another world beside their own inside the T.V. and now it is up to them to save the others before they become the next murder victim.

If you enjoy anime and the Persona 4 game I would defiantly suggest adding this one to your collection. If you've never touched a Persona game but enjoy a bit of a strange mystery, comedy, and friendship I would still suggest adding it to your collection.",1484524800,4,1490,4.11340206185567
6249563,5,B00I462XXO,Love the franchise and this series does a fantastic job for it,1483574400,,62,4.25
6249564,5,B00I462XXO,"- Synopsis: Our hero transfers from the city to the country. Immediately upon his arrival, strange events take place in the peaceful town they live in. As the story progresses, bonds are formed, allies are gained, and dangers constantly awaits them. Not only do these characters battle dangerous enemies, they realize that many of them struggle internally, as well. Tune in to see the adventures that awaits these unique group of high schoolers as they set out on a journey to Reach Out to the Truth.
===========================================================================================================

- Analysis: Persona 4 really touches on interesting concepts and emphasizes that some of the worst struggles involve internal conflict. But nobody is truly alone. If you need help, friends and/or family will be there for you. The power of bonds. Sure it's a bit cheesy, but you cannot deny the significance that it entails. I don't really see how you can live properly without relying on others unless you can live off the land like some can.

Though there are plenty of analysis that can be done on any anime, this one definitely addresses and maintains strong fundamental concepts that are often overlooked. As such, a mature viewer would be able to appreciate this more than the casual viewer. There's plenty of philosophy, psychology, and other interesting and complicated concepts that are present in this anime.

- Comments: Persona is a great series. I played the games first. But still enjoyed the animation. The anime does feel a bit rushed, but hey, I don't know much about budget and/or time constraints that anime companies deal with.

Soundtrack is great. I just feel many songs nowadays are simply superficial and are just there to make money. Almost anything can get passed off as a song these days. Thus, many songs lack significant meaning, especially when compared to songs of old. Anyways, I feel that songs in Persona contain meaning and fundamental concepts that are often ignored in contemporary society, among other things. Not only are they catchy and fresh, yet modern at times, they have a motif and message in every one of them, at least the ones with lyrics.

This is also one of the few animes where I strongly prefer the English Dub over Japanese Dub. It's just excellent. The voice actors fit their roles perfectly. But the Japanese dubs isn't bad either. After all, Japanese VAs typically are more experienced than English VAs.

- Conclusion: Of course everything has its flaws. I'd say the main thing is the anime is a bit rushed and could have used more time to develop the characters and story in a more reasonable fashion. Just like in the game, it can get repetitive since the characters have to face themselves. But repetition in games and anime is a fundamental issue anyways. I don't think anyone can do anything about it (like telling an infant not to cry).

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 26 episodes on 6 DVDs with a run-time of about 11 hours. Rated TV-14 for violence, language, and sexual content.

6249565,5,B00I462XXO,There's not a lot to say about this. If you've played the game you know the story and if you enjoyed it then you'll enjoy this all the same. Certain things happen a little differently but in a way that makes the story flow a little better for a TV adaptation. I easily recommend this to all anime/video game/Persona lovers.,1473552000,,323,4.4
6249566,5,B00I462XXO,If you love the games you will love this anime. Follows the same story as the games. I loved it.,1472860800,,96,3.85
6249567,5,B00I462XXO,"First off, it's a well made anime. The English dub seems to use pretty much the full cast of English voice actors from the game, so it's very good.

The best thing about it is anyone can enjoy it. If you've played Persona 4, you'll love reliving the story and enjoy that it's true to the source material word for word. Not only that, but they've added a few details and explain some things in greater detail.

If you haven't played it, or aren't a big gamer but want to get the story of P4 with its great characters, this is perfect since it's the full game and then some.",1464480000,,572,4.1909090909090905

6249576,5,B00I462XXO,Could not ask for a better adaptation of SMT's Persona 4. Amazing game and a just as great anime. If you have not watched this or played the game. I highly suggest doing both. Play the game then watch for the best experience.,1434672000,,225,4.255813953488372

6249578,5,B00I462XXO,"Persona 4 is one amazing game and this anime does it justice! Utilizing most if the game's voice cast, the show perfectly captures the essence of all the characters and does a fantastic job of building Yu as a person and not staying as the playable Main Character. Great music, great action, tear jerking moments, laugh out laugh jokes, and a mind numbingly superior story makes Persona 4 well worth your time and money regardless if you're a Persona fan or not!",1432166400,,462,4.646341463414634

If you were lazy, this will tell you the WHOLE story. I liked the series however... i didn't give it 5 stars BECAUSE the voices are crazy. Chie doesnt sound ANYTHING like the Chie on the game. They don't use original voices and that was the biggest bummer. Otherwise, this would have 5 stars.",1417910400,,449,4.294117647058823

6249589,5,B00I462XXO,"Persona 4 the animation is a great show, even if you haven't played the game. If you are a fan of the game, this is an excellent purchase because there are extras in the show that aren't in the game. Also the story is just fantastic.",1411862400,,233,4.086956521739131
6249590,5,B00I462XXO,This is a really good anime. It follows the Persona 4 game story exactly! So if you never played Persona 4 but want to know the story and have the Persona 4 experience then this is the right thing for you. I would even recommend this to people who have played the game like myself. I love the Persona game series and even the animations based off the last games but I didn't really buy the animation for Persona 4 until now and man I wish I got it sooner.,1411603200,3,455,4.066666666666666

8639130,4,B00I462XXO,"Persona 4 was (and still is) my favorite game on the PlayStation Vita system, and this series captures all of the joy that game offered.  What's more, it includes the secret game ending that I didn't even know about!  Now I have to go back to the game to get the secret ending.  Note that this animation is Persona 4, not Persona 4 Golden, which means the extra companion Marie isn't in the series (though she makes a cameo in the opening scene when she picks up the paper you drop just like in the game, she just doesn't appear again and is absent from the Velvet Room).

On disappointing thing about this set is the extras.  The 26 episodes of the series are on 3 disks, and the 4th disk is nothing but extras, which is great!  But what are the extras?  One is the first episode of the series in English and Japenese, apparently a slightly different cut, but I didn't see any difference so it must have been subtle.  Then, it's the Mr. Experiement show, a handful of a few minute episodes that end abruptly and try to be funny but barely come close to humor.  One extra that had appeal was the Izanagi and Izanami history lesson which I remembered from the game.  But it cuts out halfway through the story, making it worthless.  Lastly is the clean opening and closing which didn't interest me.  I was hoping for more content in the bonus disc.

I rate this animation 5/5 stars with the bonus disc earning 0/5 stars.  Overall, I would recommend this series to anyone who likes good murder mysteries, anime, anyone who has played the game or anyone who hasn't played the game (unless you are planning to play the game, in which case play it first so nothing is spoiled!).  There are a few variations in the animation and the series that I noticed, such as the group date event where they have 4 guys and 2 girls, one of the boys has to pretend to be a girl so there is an even number.  If I remember correctly, Yuske was the one that ended up having to do it, but, in the animation, it is the main player character, Yu.  Usually, when I read a book then see a movie, I hate the movie because of all of the deviations it takes from what I read.  Persona 4 animation isn't like that at all.  It is a very faithful recreation of the game, even going so far as to get part-time jobs to increase his stats like courage, which you see as commercial bumpers.  It tackles subjects such as a teen who doesn't know if he likes girls or guys, but I would say if your family is open to discussing important issues such as these, it is a show that the whole family can enjoy.

8639131,5,B00I462XXO,"The item is self explanatory, its the complete collection of the Persona 4 anime based on the namesake JRPG. It includes some basic features such as the Japanese voice track with english subtitles, as well as developer commentary voice over for all of the episodes. The anime itself is well worth watching, even after multiple playthroughs of Persona 4, as it fleshes out most plot points of the story in a manner that the game could never do justice to with its PS2 era graphics. It should be noted that some of the original english voice actors from the game were replaced with similar-sounding talent, so keep that in mind if you're a stickler about these kind of things.",1510185600,,674,4.6722689075630255

8639134,1,B00I462XXO,"Anti- Christian garbage. This junk wasn't in the game, it was added later as the atheism(fake atheism as a front for talmudism) push began in this country, and yes they're after the children. As a big fan of the game I brought this thinking it would be more of the same. I was so wrong. They have Chie saying ""If God is so great, why'd He create tests?"" The implication being that God is bad or somehow wrong. Then they have a Chie use Jesus' name as if it was the foulest of curses. She's a young Japanese girl, mind you, but of course they don't have her use one of the Shinto gods, or Buddha which would make sense, since they are important religions in Japan. Such is the desperation to market anti-Christianity to the youth of America that they ram it in there no matter how inappropriate it is. Only the words Jesus and God, not the names of other gods just in case you're unsure that they use God as a general term.",1506124800,,922,4.244318181818182
