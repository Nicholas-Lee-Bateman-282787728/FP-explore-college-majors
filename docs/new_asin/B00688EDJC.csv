8494719,3,B00688EDJC,I was expecting more info on custom car technical issues and tips on building cars.  This has very little info on car customizing as a craft.  It is more on Gene's life and has a lot of finished customs car photos which is OK but I was hoping for more on the techniques and build tips.,1430870400,3,285,4.071428571428571

8494721,5,B00688EDJC,"I had expected to see a lot of Gene Winfield custom cars, and I didn't. Part of the reason is that some of the cars he created are lost or in private collections. I don't know if, or how hard, the video makers tried to track down the cars, and maybe that wasn't their intention, but there aren't a lot of them. What there is, is a lot of screen time with Gene Winfield. He talks alot about his career and what they were doing decades ago and how the hobby evolved. It is all very interesting. I would highly recommend this video for those interested in learning more about Gene Winfield, or custom cars in general; just don't expect to view a parade of custom cars.",1373241600,2,665,4.244094488188976
