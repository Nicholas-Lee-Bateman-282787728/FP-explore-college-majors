3475557,5,B00008H2HI,"My daughter loves watching this DVD.  As she is only 9 months, I was a little nervous about her watching more TV, but this video is amazing.  It is no wonder it won the Parents Choice Award.  My daughter points to all of the animals and loves the music.  The free CD is great in the car and helps her relax when she is cranky.  I would highly recommend this DVD.",1055894400,,362,4.042253521126761
8280458,1,B00008H2HI,"Brain numbing crap.
This is a boring DVD which I think could possibly hinder your childs learning.
The whole thing is just one animal scene, then a shot of that same animal as a toy in a plain background and classical music playing over the whole thing.

No talking no words no learning.

Baby interested for about 30 seconds every now and then.

I wish I didn't waste my money.",1251417600,,378,4.371428571428571
8280459,5,B00008H2HI,"My son loved these DVDs and CDs. Much better than Little Einsteins. To this day if we but in the  cd He can tell you just by the music , Here comes the eagle part or bear etc. (he,s 6 now). A must have for the scenery alone.",1217203200,,224,3.6666666666666665
8280460,5,B00008H2HI,I would just like to say my baby  had her eyes glued to the TV screen watching the Forest Ranger DVD.  She loves the different animals in the forest and I like the fact that she enjoys the video so much.  I have recommended this video to all my friends with an age appropriate child and I give it 5 stars.,1059350400,,305,3.9672131147540983
8280461,5,B00008H2HI,"Being a mother who is very concerned about what I buy for my child, I tend to be very critical of products on the market.  I was always a little skeptical about educational videos for toddlers but when I got the Forest Ranger Dvd as a gift I was very pleased with my baby's reaction to it.  He was very focused and interested in what was on the screen.  I give the video a high rating because if my child agrees then it must be something good.",1058918400,2,443,4.068965517241379
8280462,5,B00008H2HI,"We here at the Koz household approve of the Forest Ranger Dvd for our 5 month old son Garrett.  He won't take his eyes off the screen because he loves all the little insects, the bear, and the eagle.  Watching the video is now an everyday thing after we eat dinner before he goes to sleep. Thankyou Baby Superstar.",1058918400,3,314,4.305084745762712
8280463,1,B00008H2HI,"I concur with Dr. Nelson, who has already written a review.  As a medical doctor, a PhD in Developmental Psychology, and a mother, I find it sad that this is the sort of pap that is being fed to children too young to make their preferences known.  Infants need stimulation, interaction, and challenges.  They do not need to be plopped in front of the television to watch substandard material based on outdated, junky science.  The myth of the ""Mozart Syndrome,"" the nonsense about cheap toys and reality footage, the substandard parenting ""guide,"" - this is pop, irresponsible science at its worst.  I would not recommend these videos to any parent interested in raising an alert, bright child.",1058486400,,694,4.897435897435898
8280464,1,B00008H2HI,"I was led to believe that this video was one of the Baby Einstein series, but boy was I wrong!  The minute I put the DVD in the player, it was obvious that this was not of the same quality.  Unlike the superb Baby Einstein videos, the Baby Superstar videos are slow and cheap-looking.  Also, the company is clearly trying to piggy-back onto the popularity of the excellent Baby Einstein video series.  I am writing this review so that others won't be fooled into buying these lousy videos.  Spend your money on Baby Einstein instead.",1058227200,,533,4.568421052631579
8280465,1,B00008H2HI,"As a parent of a bright, happy infant, I always look for new products to stimulate her.  The Baby Superstar DVDs are so boring and slow-moving, however, that they are not challenging at all.  She loves the Baby Einstein series, but the quality of the Baby Einstein videos is far superior.  I also noticed that the child psychologist who wrote a review found these videos unsuitable for children, which really worries me.  I think that if a doctor who specializes in this area has a problem with the videos, we shouldn't allow our children to watch them.",1058227200,,553,4.670103092783505
8280466,5,B00008H2HI,"Let me just say the little chicks are the cutest things ever.  My, as of today, 4 month old would rather watch the Forest Ranger Dvd than do anything else.  Shes completely hooked.  Just the other day she was holding her favorite toy and as soon as the video played it hit the floor, which was when I knew Id gotten my moneys worth.  I like to think my child is a baby superstar.",1057708800,,379,4.081081081081081
8280467,1,B00008H2HI,"As a child psychologist, I felt that I had to write in about the Baby Superstar dvds.  These dvds are shockingly irresponsible.  The ""science"" that they are based on is outdated, and isn't at all in line with what we in the child psychology and educational communities have been researching over the past five years.  These videos are clearly not based on current, peer-reviewed research.  The parenting tips on the dvds are also surprisingly out of date, and the ""experts"" that appear or are referenced are not considered knowledgeable or relevant by the scientific, research, or educational communities.  I would not play these dvds for my own children, and I will advise the parents in my practice that these dvds are not suitable or productive for their children.",1055980800,2,767,4.9609375
