So, You've moved into a new home and friends wanna throw a sance-themed house warming.
Was worried at first that this would be a Talking Heads scene with "" I'm a killer because..."" BUT, Soon switched to a WHO IS THE KILLER  thriller.
The house is haunted because a real estate agent gave in to the seduction by a `door to door hooker' with Vacant House fetish.
 This tragedy has given to a murder coverup, And definitely no escrow declaration...VACANT HOUSE is haunted !
Ray & Migdalia Etheridge have done it again, With no budget they still tell a taut story with minimal effects.
  One of the oddest things about their productions is FLORIDA scenery, Seriously a few paces from VACANT HOUSE location and it's like a jungle.",1207958400,,764,4.809160305343512
