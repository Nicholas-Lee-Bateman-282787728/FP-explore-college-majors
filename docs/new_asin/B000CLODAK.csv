2465446,5,B000CLODAK,Reminds me a bit of the little rascals. Has Alfalfa playing a part. His singing is just as good as it alwsys is.,1367020800,2,112,3.9130434782608696
2465447,5,B000CLODAK,"Loved this movie! It's funny, no bad language, family friendly. Will watch it again too. In fact I may even purchase this one.",1360540800,2,126,4.521739130434782
2465448,3,B000CLODAK,"First let me clarify that this product is a DVD-R, not a regular DVD.  DVD-Rs are recorded on heat-sensative discs that can start breaking down over the years. Their technology is too new to tell just how long this will take.  Some older DVD players have trouble playing DVD-R discs.  The master film used is 16mm, but it is in fairly good shape.

Now about the movie:  I really wanted to give five stars to Nostalgia Merchant for taking the chance to offer this rare title on home video, but the movie just doesn't warrent it.

The cover credits Alfalfa as the star, but he really is delegated to just a supporting role as one of the ""Reg'lar Fellers"" gang members.  This must have been a let down to him, as he was well known for his appearances in the Our Gang/Little Rascals comedy shorts.  The main kid stars of this movie make the stars of the awful MGM ""Our Gang"" shorts look like the classic kids of the ""Hal Roach's Little Rascals"" shorts.  Ultra-cute singing mixed with over acting by the stars make you long for more scenes with Alfalfa.

The story is also not well thought out, it sounds much better on the cover synopsis.  It starts as a radio contest film (making you yearn for the classic Mike Fright short) giving Alfalfa the opportunity to sing badly again, then it turns into a missing person film, then a ganster film.  Even this discription makes the film sound better than it is.

Those devoted fans of Our Gang/The Little Rascals, particularly those of Alfalfa, should get this rare film to see what became of their star.  It is a real curiosity, one of the last big roles Alfalfa had in his life.  But watch it as a curiosity, not a classic.",1146009600,4,1664,4.445544554455446

8099208,2,B000CLODAK,"When I was 8 I would have given it four stars, at over 60 two stars was the most I could muster.  A little too high on the goofiness meter.  Definitely not Little Rascal quality. Alfalfa did do a bit of his ""croonering"" which made me chuckle for a second but it was obviously an attempt to ride the Rascal's coattails.",1393632000,,318,4.19672131147541
