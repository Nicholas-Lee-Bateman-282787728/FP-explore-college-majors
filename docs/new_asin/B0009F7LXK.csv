8059960,1,B0009F7LXK,"This DVD was a total rip off.  The first clue that something was wrong was misspelled names of towns in America in the itinerary on the back.  A hotel named in Las Vegas was demolished 20 years ago.  The color is very poor and the content is superficial. It must have been filmed many, many years ago.  The credits showing a German company added to the confusion about this product.",1346889600,,382,4.414285714285715
8059961,1,B0009F7LXK,"This ""2005"" documentary was a complete waste of money. Immediately from the first images of fluoro-coloured windsurfers and women with massive hair, it was clear this documentary was either made in the 1980's, or made in 2005 with stock video's filmed in the 80's. Information for travelling in unknown areas must be up-to-date to be of any use, and I find it highly disappointing that an amateur travel video such as this that is clearly 20 years old is marketing itself as a 2005 travel guide.",1172275200,6,495,4.767441860465116
