1652516,5,B00005R243,"I love this movie. There is wall-to-wall entertainment; or rather, tire-to-tire. Not one minute leaves you bored. It's a road movie but there is so much more. I love the characters. The actors playing them are all fantastic. I know this is an awful review but if you have ever just wanted to relax, past midnight, to watch a cool movie that will make you laugh but not to where your ribs hurt (the older we get, the harder it is to watch really, really funny movies, isn't it?) then this is your film.",1142467200,8,501,4.340425531914893
1652517,3,B00005R243,"Hi im carl and i live in Sarasota florida. When i was young around 1980 or so Interstate 75 was being built down the west coast. Just east of Sarasota there is a town called Fruitville. This is the town they used as Ticlaw. They painted all of the town pink, and erected a false church steeple behind some trees. The overpass that is referenced in the movie was just south of the Fruitville road(SR780) exit and passed over Palmer road. Its close proximity to the SR780 exit made the palmer road overpass not need any exits. But you will have to watch the movie to find out what they do to the overpass(which was a brand new I75 overpass). I rated it as a three as it was a so-so film but has interesting Florida and I75 history. I just ordered my copy for posterity.",1141430400,4,767,4.260273972602739
1652518,5,B00005R243,"If you are looking for a good laugh, get this movie!  An oldie, I've been looking for it on cable for 10+ years.  Beverly D'Angelo, Beau Bridges, William Devane, Jessica Tandy, Hume Chroyn, David (?) (the guy who played ""Sledgehammer"") and other character actors you'll recoznize.  One of the funniest scenes has George Dzunda smelling women's panties.",1055808000,15,352,5.140350877192983

1652522,5,B00005R243,"I rented this video when it first came out in the 1980's and I loved it.  There are many stories intertwined together throughout the movie.  When I saw I could purchase it on Amazon video to watch whenever I wanted, I knew I had to purchase it.  Watched it the other night and still very funny.  I have seen it many times in the past so I know what is coming next in the movie.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good comedy.",1462752000,,434,4.0
1652523,1,B00005R243,Really a sad Schlesinger movie.  I can see why it made no money.,1454544000,,64,3.923076923076923
1652524,3,B00005R243,"I was taking a bus tour to Mt Dora, FL where this film was made in 1980. My grandson was able to bring the movie up on my computer for me.  I've wanted to go there since I saw the movie in the 80's. I could not get it on Netflix or local libraries. The Lakeside Inn is the oldest continually operational inn in the state of FL.  The movie was a little corny but I loved it because I was going there.  I am pleased the movie will stay on my computer for a month.  Can show my friends.",1447286400,2,483,3.8
1652525,3,B00005R243,I saw this at a theater during it's one week run. It's quite a surprise to see it listed as one of the great flops in the history of movies. I thought that it was a very good satire on the human condition.,1435363200,,205,3.7906976744186047
1652526,1,B00005R243,"One of the worst movies to ever grace a screen of any size. The only reason we rented this was to see the City of Mount Dora Florida back in the day after we had visited it this year. A local told us that during the making of this movie in the early 80's they painted the town pink. So we rented this and other then a lack of plot, some truly awful acting and an incoherent ending, (spoiler alert) there is a water skiing elephant, so there's that.

If your having trouble sleeping try this, or say, if you really dislike the person in your secret Santa office gift exchange giving this may be the ticket. Everyone else not so much.",1420329600,,632,4.180327868852459

1652528,5,B00005R243,"This movie is great fun.  It intermingles many plots, some a little heavy at times, but everyone gets their just desserts in the end, in a most entertaining way.",1398211200,,161,4.551724137931035
1652529,5,B00005R243,"This is a classic 80's movie with all the great stars of the day. Occasionally found on cable, but not often enough. The DVD is very hard to find and extremely expensive new as it has been out of print for decades.
Story of a dying Florida town passed over for an exit on the freeway that cuts through their town. They take it upon themselves to create an off ramp and kidnap all the motorists coming off the road. The movie follows all the wacky characters driving to Florida who get held hostage and the ensuing results.",1390262400,2,522,4.336734693877551
1652530,1,B00005R243,"Very boring and dull, stupid acting and again poor poor quality,again, not worth the money. There's only two or three movies that i've downloaded from this site that were really good,and those were in HD. For the most part stick with the HD movies at least you get good picture quality.",1389484800,,286,4.627450980392157

1652532,5,B00005R243,"Honky Tonk Freeway is an 80's movie worth watching! The 80's had some amazingly funny actors and actresses and this movie made sure it was full of fun! William Devane, Beau Bridges, Beverly De'Angelo to name a few, filled this funny movie with lots of talents. This movie was made in my hometown of Mount Dora Florida. (Yes, I was in it with my family as extras)They painted our entire downtown pink! The storyline is about a small town in Florida trying to get an off-ramp to the new freeway and all the problems getting it. You will see a pink town, good music, lots of mishaps and a waterskiing elephant! We need more humor in our constantly changing world. Get this movie, grab your family and some popcorn and sit down and laugh yourself happy!",1309737600,5,749,4.514705882352941
1652533,5,B00005R243,"This was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.
Celebrity cast,  Jessica Tandy/Hume Cronin
Some of the best stunt work you'll see.
Even has an elephant water ski.",1252368000,,168,4.6
1652534,5,B00005R243,"This has to be one of the best comedies of all time. Just check out the list of actors in this film, not to mention the characters, and situations the portray, all of them on their way to Florida for one reason or the other, all connecting in the town of Ticlaw. They could have made a sitcom of this movie and I'm  sure it would have been on the tube for years. I first watched this on HBO in the 80s, taped it, and have enjoyed it ever since. You won't be disappointed.",1235347200,2,471,4.01063829787234
1652535,4,B00005R243,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It was fun and it probably helped that my expectations were pretty low.  I grew up in the town that hosted most of the downtown scenes - Mount Dora, FL (a correction to the previous reviewer indicating Fruitville was the filming location).  They did film the scene of blowing up the overpass near Sarasota.",1199059200,2,336,4.661016949152542
1652536,3,B00005R243,"Honky Tonk Freeway, for many years, held the record for losing more money than any Hollywood product in history.  Having probably the worst, most ill-conceived title possible and no real star power, it was easy to overlook.  The fact is, it's a funny movie. This isn't ""art"" and it doesn't pretent to be.  But, if I have a choice of spending an evening with either Honky Tonk Freeway or Out of Africa, it's going to be the trip to Ticlaw, Florida for me.",1193616000,,454,4.445783132530121

1652538,5,B00005R243,"The movie is great fun to watch with my family. Parts of this film was filmed in Sarasota,FL where we live and I did work as an extra on this film. We were thrilled to find it and have a copy to enjoy again and again, and of course to go with the my keepsake Honky Tonk Freeway t-shirt, paycheck stubs and letter of thanks.",1156896000,3,323,3.9846153846153847
7951548,5,B00005R243,"Classic Comedy, Major Stars for a low promoted movie of its day.  A hidden gem.  Sure the acting is not great and the plot is far fetched, but it is just absolutely funny.  If someone loves older comedies of early 80s, this one is worth adding to collection.  Its rare so price is high.",1504137600,,286,4.2407407407407405
7951549,5,B00005R243,"I seen this was a kid when I rented it from the video store in the 80's, and seeing it again on DVD, I remembered it was good, and that Beverly D'Angelo was in it, but I wondered being that I'd seen it, should I bother with it again when there's plenty of movies I haven't seen.  But I thought, yeah I feel like a good nostalgic trip back to the 80's.  I'm glad I did.  Beside D'Angelo, who would two years later go onto star in the most successful stand the test of time road trip series of movies as Ellen Griswold, there's so many recognisable faces in this. Most are obviously old people today when you're seeing them in TV shows and movies, (this was released 1981), so you're seeing them when they're young and that's just interesting in itself. Daniel Stern (City Slickers, one of the wet bandits from Home Alone movies, etc) plays a young hitchiker in this one, I didn't remember he was in this but I enjoyed seeing him as this character.  A young and thin Beau Bridges as a stressed family man who has written a kids book about a mad horse Ricky the Carnivorous Pony, hits the road and thinks his dreams have come true when his car is stolen and Beverly D'Angelo a hot young woman taking her mother's ashes to Miami to spread around, gives him a lift. There's plenty of well known faces, I'll let you discover them all, that's part of the fun.

This is a character driven movie, and there's plenty of characters.  Although there is a plot going on involving a Floridian reliant on tourism town called Ticlaw, who raised $10 000 to bribe a Department of Transport public servant to ensure they get an off ramp from a new freeway going to Miami, who have to do whatever is necessary to survive when the public servant just pockets their money and the freeway bypasses the town.  The main drive of the plot, is a character story movie, as numerous individuals, couples, families and other groups head towards Miami from various parts of the USA.  Amongst them you've got an family who have bought a new RV, but of course one kid won't use the bathroom on board, a couple on nuns (there's always nuns in 80's road trip movies), an elderly couple where the wife is an alcoholic but will always argue she is not, a couple of bank robbers with a black plastic bag full of cash, a bus load of Chinese orphans, a pimp with a prostitute who isn't afraid recruiting new staff.  There's plenty of spins on common car trip happenings, such as the prostitute realising he's probably going to recruit a second pouts and constantly says as she's being ignored, I bags the front seat. There's many other road user characters too.  Other societal occurrences are given the comedy treatment, such as anyone who looks a bit working class has had the stuck up old saleswoman give the condescending ""can I help you"" which means get lost this place isn't for you.  Well this movie handles that well with one of the bank robbers and some underwear.

If you like road trip movies, want to see great actors when they were younger, or just want a great character driven film you can't pass this one up.",1494892800,,3084,4.4389380530973455
