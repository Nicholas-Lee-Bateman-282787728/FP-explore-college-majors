5152142,4,B008CN091M,"Other reviewers made comparisons to the Princess & the Pauper movie, I guess it's sort of a similar premise, but its got a more modern take & for the age group that enjoys watching these movies-it's good. My daughter has already watched it several times & if she's happy, I'm happy :)",1348358400,,284,4.480769230769231

5152144,5,B008CN091M,"My daughter reports, ""We own all the barbie movies. I must say all the newer ones are pretty well made for a barbie film. My 2 year old loves this one cause the songs are slow enough she's able to try and sing along. It has tons of color Like all their films but it has a modern flare for sure. I even kinda enjoy watching it :) """,1348099200,,330,3.7971014492753623
5152145,2,B008CN091M,"I have all the Barbie movies for my grandgirls - they love 'em and they did like this one too....but their mom and I didn't - it's unfortunate because whoever makes these movies...just recycled this one...they took other songs from other movies and redid them....which is fine to an extent...basically the whole premise was copied, there wasn't anything new about it - I know the movies are made for little girls...but they don't understand what a rip-off is and maybe that's a good thing for now - just don't like paying full price for something that was being ripped off. Both of the stars in the movie had magical items....hairbrush and microphone...I don't recall anything in the movie explaining how that came to be, it just was - unlike the other Barbie movies, they usually did a great job in weaving that into the story lines - this one didn't.  Oh well, like I said, the girls liked the movie.",1347753600,5,902,4.6375
5152146,5,B008CN091M,"This does have the same basic idea as Princess and the Pauper but is it the same movie?  Not at all!  The girls are more carefree and childish in this film, I mean that in the best way possible.  You get two entirely different characters from Keira and Tori than we did with PatP's Anneliese and Erica. For one, these girls seem much younger and reflect teenagers of today.  Also the music is bent towards pop (obviously) and they don't spend nearly as much time focusing on love interests as they do on showing the girls beginning to really see the world around them and how they can make a difference.  This is not to say that PatP wasn't good, I love both movies equally, I just think its unfair to lump the two together when the only thing they have in common is that they're both loosely based on The Prince and the Pauper (Popstar being VERY loosely based).  As for the similar song, I assumed Tori was a descendant of Anneliese's royal family. I could be wrong but they were looking through that book and she sang the same words not to mention her palace was on a cliff overlooking her kingdom.  Even if that's not the case it's their movie, they can copy it if they want.  The thing I found ironic was that even though this seemed like a younger film my 5 yr old cousin didn't find it nearly as engaging as PatP but my mom and I loved it.",1347753600,10,1346,4.250980392156863
5152147,1,B008CN091M,"I cannot believe the gall of the creators / ""writers"" of this new film.  This film contains several songs from other Barbie films, inclusive of Barbie: The Princess and the Pauper, but even worse, it is almost a total copy of the storyline from Barbie: The Princess and the Pauper.  The renditions of the loosely adapted ""To Be a Princess..."" and other copied songs from other films are so much worse in this film!  Buy Barbie: The Princess and the Pauper and pass on this hacked film! Shame on them!!",1347321600,16,501,4.544444444444444
5152148,4,B008CN091M,"Mattel's tradition of putting out singing friends movies in Autumn (and fairytopia themed movies in Spring) continues with Princess and the Popstar.

In this movie (which follows the previous Barbie movie The Princess and the Pauper story similarly), Barbie is Tori, a modern princess wishing for a bit more freedom away from propriety.  Meanwhile, Nikki stars as popstar Keira - who wears a wig in the same tradition of Hannah Montana and is a popstar by day and normal girl by night.  Keira longs to be away from the responsibilities of being a popstar (making the next album, paying her employees, the late and long hours).  Tori is hounded by her Aunt to become a proper and noble princess - but Tori is too full of mischief to be a boring girl like that. With the aid of a magic microphone (Keira) and hair brush (Tori), the girls are able to exchange places and enjoy each other's worlds.

The DVD contains all the singing and original songs you expect from the friends' series of Barbie DVDs.  And, of course, that bit of fashion and magic that has come to be the hallmark of the modern Barbie movies.

My 9 year old loves each new DVD the best and this one is no exception.  It's as entertaining and good for rewatches.  The best recommendation - she has been singing the songs from the movie non stop since we got the dvd.",1346803200,24,1331,4.5125

5152150,2,B008CN091M,The DVD was played once before the sound began to cut out throughout the previews and movie.  Have one disappointed child.  This was supposed to be new however it seemed the package had been used and was rewrapped.,1497916800,,214,4.605263157894737
5152151,5,B008CN091M,"I personally thought this show was filled with a vast array of narcissistic and ridiculous characters... but I'm not 5 years old.

Our daughter had a very bad reaction to pollen and fought through itchy eyes while we waited for the symptoms to slowly clear after a bath.

This show helped to calm her down and she was fully engaged even though I really don't put these shows on for her.  We let her choose this time because she wasn't feeling well.

Thankfully, by the end, she was feeling so much better.  The music wasn't terribly bad.  I did find myself singing a few of the songs after the show had ended even though I was desperately trying to purge them from my brain.

We aren't Barbie people, but it served its purpose. ;-)",1492732800,,731,4.41044776119403

5152201,1,B008CN091M,"The theme of this movie is pretty Innocuous; However, it is not until the final scenes that you see any characters being close to non white. I would expect by now that companies producing these kinds of movies would get with the program and include characters of color, different Sizes and ages, etc. What is so hard about that?",1454198400,,328,4.576271186440678
5152202,5,B008CN091M,"My all-time favorite Barbie movie! You read that right, my favorite. My three year old likes it too; but as most parents know we have the wonderful honor of sitting through all the movies are small children are watching. This movie is fun and upbeat, the songs are pretty catchy, my little one sings them all the time. Sometimes I find myself humming one of them while washing dishes or folding laundry.

In this movie The Princess and The Popstar switch places and discover how much they really love their lives. It is the classic story, ""The Princess and The Pauper"" but redone for today's day and age. Of course there are some parts that are simply ridiculous and slightly hilarious, but this movie is a lot of fun. I like it much more than the Barbie version of ""The Princess and The Pauper"". There is a song that is used, with some slight changes is verse, in both movies - I could never understand this and neither does my little. She likes the Popstar version much better.

I highly recommend this movie for your little girls. I think that there is slightly less focus on fashion and toy-selling than many of the other Barbie movies. I have also found that the lead characters are more developed in this movie than in other Barbie movies.",1453939200,4,1245,4.528888888888889

5152434,5,B008CN091M,"This is a good one of the barbie movies.  Features a Katy-Perry style popstar and a stereotypical Barbie Princess, who switch roles and Learn Something.  Modelled on the Twain novel, Prince and the Pauper.  On some level it's obnoxious (I mean, really, our choices in life are to be a princess or a popstar?  Where's the actual pauper?  The princess has to realize that There are Poor People, but her role is to be Lady Beneficent, not ever to change society in a structural way).  On another, I kind of like the observation that princesses and celebrities are more or less the same.  And it also seems pointless to do a lot of cultural analysis here.  My 9 year old, who usually despises Barbie, is happy to watch this one with her younger sisters, because the pop star is cool and the songs are catchy.",1396828800,,804,4.496551724137931

This one is cute and although usually I have a hard time watching the movies my daughter likes, I found myself watching this one without getting too bored. It's fun. The problem is, it's hard to really relate to both a pop star and a princess that don't like their lives...seems like they are whining a little.  How can you be a pop star and whine and be that unhappy with your life?  Isn't that what she wanted?  If she wanted to be a real songwriter...oh I'm over thinking it.  I mean, I suppose I could understand the princess being unhappy with her life since she didn't choose it but come on.  Her aunt is controlling, why doesn't princess Barbie tell her father how her aunt is?  Why does her father let her aunt talk to her that way?  That's odd.  Oh well.

What is also good is that if you are looking for a movie without scary villains for a sensitive little girl the ""bad guy"" is just a greedy guy that steals diamonds from the castle, no killing, poison, etc., whatsoever. I saw the review by Chrislee, and i want to say that there is no whining. The popstar is unhappy because people are being mean to her. This one guy says, tell her i want new songs or else i will destroy her job! Crider steals her jewelry, she is under a lot of pressure, like many of us are and wondered what it would be like to be a princess for a day. She is even reluctant to trade places when Tori (the princess) asks her. And all the princess is upset about is that she is under pressure too.",1379203200,,854,4.150602409638554
5152535,2,B008CN091M,"Reasons why I hate this movie:

**Warning!  Spoilers!**

1. The Princess - She is completely disrespectful to her aunt.
2. The Pop Star - She is rude to everyone - especially her manager, Crider.
3. The whining - ""My life is so hard!  I get breakfast served in bed every day!"" (The princess). ""My life is so hard!  People adore me!"" (the pop star).
4.  The ""villain"" - I feel so badly for Crider and can see why he steals the gardenia.  His dreams have been crushed and he is working for an ungrateful girl.  It is never okay to steal, but I can see why he is frustrated and fed up.
5. The whining - see number 3.  I really cannot stand how sorry they feel for themselves.

This is by far the worst Barbie movie I have ever seen.  Horrible characters and an equally terrible lesson to be learned.  Do yourself a favor and watch the original Barbie's the Princess and the Pauper.",1378857600,2,878,4.254545454545455

5152539,2,B008CN091M,"When I get a Barbie adaptation of a story, I am not expecting a faithful retelling.

But I don't think it is too much to ask for them to get an inkling of the basic message right.

This retelling of Prince and the Pauper misses the point that being poor sucks.

The princess and the pop star are each well-off, gorgeous, blah blah blah. It is really more of a City Mouse, Country Mouse than Prince and the Pauper.

Gritting my teeth at the changed message was bad enough: this has got to be the worst written song collection I have ever experienced.

""When I was young, I played for fun..."" Listen. That doesn't rhyme. The approximate rhymes are atrocious. Let me remind you that this is for an age group learning to read, and approximate rhymes hinder the learning of that skill.

""Here I am!!! Burning like a spark!""  (A spark isn't burning.) ""Spark! Light up the DARK again!"" (Sparks don't light up the dark.)

Lazy, lazy lazy.

The usual Barbie message of ""Be true to yourself, as long as you are well-off, tall, slender, and white"" is intact. Goody.

My daughter, who got this out of the library, is tall and blonde and therefore can't see how insulting the message is. So she happily dances around the house singing the horrible songs. Two stars for the sheer enjoyment my target-audience daughter experiences.",1378339200,5,1316,4.585470085470085

They have almost become really annoying and cheesy especially the new ""Ken"". I even like the songs waay better from the older ones and now they're just cheesy disney-ish pop songs. They really need to go back to the old format where it had more substance, originality, and class. Even the tinkerbell movies are waay better than the newer ones.

5152630,5,B008CN091M,"If you're a fan of the old Barbie movies as my children and I are, you need to add this to your collection!  And if this is your first Barbie movie, it's a wonderful introduction!

My daughters (ages 3 and 6) LOVE this movie, and I have to admit I enjoy watching it, as well.  It's a great story of friendship and discovering your own strengths and talents.  The music is very catchy; my daughters absolutely love the song ""Here I Am"" and play that track over and over again.  I don't understand why some reviewers are so upset with this re-telling of the Princess and the Pauper story.  It is merely a different take on a classic story, NOT a ripoff.  And only one of the songs is the same, (""To Be A Princess"") but with some fun modern changes.  I was delighted when I heard it, and thought it a great way to pay homage to the other Barbie movie, which is also wonderful.

We have most of the old Barbie movies starting with the Nutcracker, and the Three Musketeers being the most recent.  The old ones are simply wonderful, and speaking as a mom, I prefer them.  I began to dislike the way the Barbie movies were changing.  The animation was looking absurd, with pointy chins and ridiculously thin figures, (Fashion Fairy tale comes to mind as the worst of the lot).  And I did not like the way the characters acted and dressed.  I didn't feel it was appropriate for my young girls to watch characters obsessed with clothes, make-up and material things.  Or to be running around with short shorts, bare tummies and tattoos, as in the latest Barbie Mermaid movies.

This movie is a breath of fresh air, and reminds me of the old ones.  The two main characters dress cute but not vulgar, and appropriate for their age.  They are fun, spunky, a little childish, but they grow and mature, just like your average young girl!  And I love that Kelly Sheridan is back as the voice of Barbie.  The songs are fun and bouncy, and my girls love to sing and dance along with them.

This film has restored my faith in the Barbie movies, and I find myself eagerly awaiting the next installment.  If you're on the shelf, buy this movie!  Your children (and you as a parent) will not be disappointed!",1360540800,,2186,4.396508728179551

I know we've all seen the questionable quality Barbie movies before. But, it seems like they actually tried in this one. I don't mind watching it with my daughter and have fun doing it. We originally saw this when it was aired and decided to buy it immediately after.

People often complain about the princess phenomena and how it can lead to issues. This shows the negative aspects of being a princess. Personally, I say let young children dream and imagine what they want. But, you can get the best of both is this show.",1356912000,,595,4.4495412844036695

You just have to find a balance between letting your children enjoy the movies that their peers enjoy, while at the same time stressing that there are/will be more opportunities in life than being either a Princess or a Popstar, both virtually impossible options for the vast majority of young girls.

He also thinks certain parts are just hilarious - I mean full on belly laughs from this adorable kid. :-)  I've got video of he and his sister copying the dance moves, too!

We got the movie from Redbox after WEEKS of begging from my daughter. I can't stand Barbie. And as opposed to Barbie DOLLS as I am, the movies actually aren't too bad. I was able to watch it twice. My daughter on the other hand, watched it a bazillion times!

So, when this movie went on sale for $5 on amazon, I scooped it up.  I wish I could say I will be my daughter's hero when she get's this movie for Christmas, but all the credit will go to Santa. :)

But if your daughters are fans who have faithfully watched every one, you can see (and hear) the total lack of originality.  The whole premise of the movie is Princess and the Pauper. Right down to some of Prince and Pauper songs with minor lyric changes. Actually a lot if not all of the songs in this movie are from previous Barbie movies with some lyric changes to make it fit this one.  Even the characters are in previous movies....just change the name, outfit, keep the hair/voice and viola!  Character on the cheap!  The total lack of creativity is mind-boggling!  Now they do that with many of their movies, I know, but when you cant even come up with original songs either, that really puts it over the top.  Shame on them!

I have purchased and watched almost all the previous Barbie movies because my girls love them so much. I refuse to buy this one, though....I pretty much have it in our Barbie library already.",1353456000,,1042,4.529411764705882

This has still become my daughters very favorite (with fashion fairytale and perfect christmas comming up closely behind). Some movies are not meant to be an entire life lesson. Which is how I see this one. It is just fun and girly. Which is what my daughter is. In this she can sing along and dance along. And become enchanted by the transformations. It's introduced new imaginative play ideas as later I find her strumming on her air guitar making up little songs. Is it an emmy worthy film, no.

I loved the messages, the music, and the fact that my daughter was being introduced to classic stories/composers in a new, fun way.  I hate to say that these movies have just become too commercialized.  This is especially evident with this last movie.  Sure, it was ""cute"" and many young girls will still love it.  But my now 10 year old was unimpressed and herself called it a bad knock off of Pauper.  I truly wish Mattel would go back to classic story lines and important messages for our young girls.  Barbie movies were a bi-annual tradition in my house, as the girls were always excited for the newest one.  This is the first one we didn't buy right away for our collection (opting for Redbox instead) and I am honestly glad I only spent $1.20 on it.  And I have to add, the Perfect Day song was already something already written and used in a Wii Cheer game...

This seems to be the typical barbie movie (it's like Princess Charm School, Mermaid Tale, ect). My daughter loved it so much that she is going to be the ""purple"" barbie for halloween (i'm unsure of her name, i don't pay attention that much to it lol). If your child loves the other barbie movies this one will not disappoint.",1350518400,,450,4.244186046511628
5152771,5,B008CN091M,"When this movie was announced, I was concerned and a bit put off by the similarity in concept to Princess and the Pauper, which I thought had been done quite well and did not need any sort of make over.  In fact, I had no intention of buying it either, but rather put myself on a list at the library to wait for my turn to check it out.  There are a lot of reviews that touch on plot, I'm really not, because this is directed more at buyers who may also be unsure if they want to purchase this given the potential similarities with Princess and the Pauper.

Having seen the movie, I was pleasantly surprised.  Though both movies have their origin in the same Mark Twain novel (The Prince and the Pauper) I felt that this movie was different enough to hold it's own as a separate piece of art.  The new songs were catchy.  What other reviewers have noted about the reuse of some songs is true, however this is a tried and true Hollywood formula that has been used so much it didn't bother me...some Irving Berlin songs for example have appeared time and time again in movies, like the one about the Easter Bonnet and then there is White Christmas. And a certain Smash Mouth song keeps cropping up in movies also... Plus, it was believable under the context of a Pop Star...many bands do cover songs of other people's music in real life, so I just felt it did not detract from the credibility of the movie.

I enjoyed the artistic direction of this piece a lot.  The Graphics on the performance sections were quite sophisticated in their simulation of over the top music videos and productions and I was actually pretty impressed by that.  As an adult, I could say that it would be nice to have the message about embracing your own life made a bit clearer, but this is a movie directed at kids, and so it can be seen as justifiable that it wasn't more substantive in that regard. And once I thought about it, I realized that from a kid's perspective, similarities in plot probably aren't even a concern.  Not that I want to see lots of reused movie concepts...

And my daughter did love it.  Overall, it was actually a very charming little movie I thought. I would still really like to see celebrity and materialism embraced less in the Barbie movies, but it wasn't enough of a distraction for me to give it fewer stars.  So if you are sitting on the fence on getting this movie, I think it is worth giving it a try...I think you could end up enjoying it more than you expected.  And your daughters probably won't care about any similarities any more than mine did.",1350432000,,2563,4.379746835443038

This Barbie movie is unique in that it takes the classic story of a 'princess with a problem' and gives it the twist of adding a popstar to the story, with modern clothing and songs.  This definitely appeals to my daughter - she loves the girly-girl aspect of being a princess, but also the center-stage diva aspect of a singing popstar, to her it's the best of both worlds.

The songs are catchy and fun, and as with all of the Barbie movies there's a happy ending as a result of friends helping each other and working as a team.",1349827200,,749,4.253521126760563

To clarify something Barbie ""Princess and the Pop Star"" is the WORST Barbie soundtrack ever in a movie. Also gotta add to the lack of originality a redone version of the ""Classic"" ""To Be A Princess"" from ""Princess and the Pauper"" REALLY? Furthermore the plot had a lot of un realistic turns and twists. Not the worst Barbie movie to date but FAR from the best. My little sister herself smacked her face and held it down nodding in disapproval at least 4 times during movie.
I only write reviews when I see needed and with all the positive reviews one like this HAD to be written.

Many reviewers complain about this being a rip-off of Barbie: Princess and the Pauper, but it should be understood that this is not a rip-off, merely a different telling of a classic tale. The pop-style songs in this movie are vastly different than anything in Princess and the Pauper, which had a more traditional Broadway style, so I'm not sure what other reviewers are referring to when they say the same songs are being reused here. Similar themes represented in various songs does not make them the 'same songs', just like the same theme of the movie doesn't make it 'the same movie.' This is a fun, enjoyable movie with a light, pleasant touch. If you are looking for deep, meaningful themes and profound messages, you won't find yourself beaten over the head with them here. This is a fun movie, made for fun, for little girls (and anyone who likes a good movie) to enjoy. As with all of the newer Barbie movies, this is more modern in its overall feel, but happily, still retaining a good traditional foundation. The pop songs are, for me anyway, less enjoyable than the classical music of the early Barbie movies, but while they aren't brilliant, the movie still has a light and easy sense of fun, so if you're not too obsessed with this being the greatest movie of all time, just take it on its own merits and enjoy it for the truly fun movie it is, you'll be thoroughly pleased with it.

5152781,5,B008CN091M,Not a big fan of Barbie movies myself but my 6 year old daughter is. She loves it. Wants to re watch ad nauseam. Music is slightly less annoying than most.,1348963200,,155,4.032258064516129
5152782,2,B008CN091M,"My daughter really enjoys the Barbie movies. I watch them with her to see if they provide a solid message and help to empower her. The problem with this movie in the Barbie franchise is twofold:

1. it mirrors Princess and the Pauper too much without enough differentiation
2. topics were too subtle for kids

The first item has been discussed in other threads so I won't add more. The second item is glaringly displayed when the Tori is pretending to be Keira and wanders into a part of town she is not familiar with and finds two girls playing hopscotch. I don't want to give away plot details, but a child is not going to understand why a free concert helps the town. There are many other subtle subplots to the movie, but they aren't built enough.

Now, one of the main things in many of the Barbie movies is being true to yourself and making strong, well grounded decisions. Again, this is done in a weak way in this movie compared to the others in the franchise.

If you are looking for a Barbie movie to help your daughter build herself up and have Barbie in a role model from a perspective of making good decisions... this one does not deliver.

While the songs are catchy for girls and my enjoys them, I think they could have done much more with this movie.

Save your money and get Mermaid Tales, Princess and the Pauper, and Christmas Carol.

All the best for you and your daughters,

8526807,5,B008CN091M,"Expect a downgrade from today's resolution but this is a great movie. There are a few well known songs like perfect day and girls wanna have fun, etc. Cant beat the price. I actually lost this movie in a move and I had to buy another because my kid loves it months later.
A nice gift idea are the two singing dolls that go with this movie. Moral of the movie is be happy with what you have. Kind of like the movie Freaky Friday but barbied.",1508457600,,440,4.068965517241379
8526808,1,B008CN091M,Barbie and especially her friends are not very kind..... Ken is a total suck up to Barbie and that's not healty!!!!!,1503273600,,116,4.571428571428571
8526809,1,B008CN091M,"REALLY? is Barbie running out of fresh material so fast that she has to stoop to re-writing Barbie The Princess and The Pauper? Most of the songs were literally re-written from the Barbie Princess and the Pauper movie. Only a couple of them were truly 'new' and 'original' songs. And it just has way too much of that glitzy-glamy fashionista theme I really am tired of, that Barbie pretty much portrays anymore. That's all that Barbie dolls used to be for the longest time. That super-perfect doll, with all the best desirable curves and outfits etc. This movie is just another fine example of that Barbie image, and why so many girls starve themselves or cake themselves in make-up to look perfect, act perfect, etc.

Honestly the older Barbie movies based on the classic fairytales are way better. The newer ones based on being preppy, hip, glammy, fashionistas, vibe with so much superficiality. Very happy I watched this first on Youtube for free, instead of forking over money to support Mattel's make-up, supermodel, flashy glam ideals. In fact, I make it a habit to watch ALL Barbie movies first on Youtube for free before rushing out to buy them. That way I can have like zero guilt in buying the ones I do choose to buy. This one, as well as all the other high fashion themed ones shall never find themselves in my personal movie library.

And spoiler alert! Magical dress transformation. Again. Pretty much a thing in just about all Barbie movies. If you're the hero of the movie that is. If you're not the hero of the movie, then you just don't get the best awesomest dress. In fact, you typically suffer a wardrobe malfunction. What kind of message is that sending to our little girls? All your dreams will come true, you'll get the best dresses, and everyone you don't like will suddenly turn into ugly, unfashionable hags?

This movie is such a total let-down to me, and does not compare to Barbie Princess and The Pauper. Princess and the Pauper is like the best, with it's classic fairytale style, moral views of doing what you can to fulfill your duties, etc. The switching of places occurred as a way to save the kingdom. Here, the swapping of places is for the purpose of ""I don't like my lifestyle and want something different.""

Barbie, you disappointed me with this one...",1502150400,,2294,4.670792079207921
