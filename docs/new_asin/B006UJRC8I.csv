8504547,3,B006UJRC8I,"I must admit with another reviewer who said he was a sucker for the classics. I am also. This version of sleeping beauty deviated from the original so much that I could barely finish watching it. The lilac fairy doesn't dance in this production. The dancing is okay...not great, but not bad either. The set was too busy, with too many people on stage. The fairies dancing seemed slow and stilted. Aurelie Dupont is very good, but they focused too many times on her face where we had to watch her strange breathing technique. Made it hard to concentrate on the dancing. The best version I've seen, hands down, is the Bolshoi version. It's an older version that was transferred to dvd, so the image quality isn't great, but even so, it's my favorite version of sleeping beauty. I can't say that the bolshoi ballet is perfect as far as their choice for Aurora, but the fairy dances are outstanding and Yuri Vetrov as Caribosse is absolutely perfect.
