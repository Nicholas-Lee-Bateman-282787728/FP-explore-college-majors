5675817,5,B00BUH1QHS,"My 13 year old son and I absolutely loooooved this movie! Randy Orton is as crazy in this movie as his persona in the wrestling ring. The movie has humor, action and is suspenseful! The movie plot is written very well! This is way more better than the first one that John Cena was in. Randy proves he can act! You won't be sorry when you see this movie!",1370390400,7,353,4.130434782608695
5675818,5,B00BUH1QHS,This was a great movie. Randy has proven he can act. Cindy Busby was also great in this movie. This was so much better than the original movie with Cena. The blu-ray has awesome picture and sound. Its a must watch for everyone. This was the best movie WWE has released as of late. Definitely worth owing for any action movie fan or Randy Orton fan!,1370304000,5,348,4.287878787878788
5675819,5,B00BUH1QHS,Much better than the first two movies. Randy is a great actor and he shows that he could be the next WWE leading man. Great storyline and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's a movie everyone should own and Randy is very nice to look at.,1370304000,3,241,3.938775510204082
5675820,2,B00BUH1QHS,If you've seen 12 Rounds don't bother with this stinker of a sequel. It's basically an inferior rehash of the first.,1370131200,2,116,4.571428571428571

Nick Malloy (Orton) is an EMT walking home with his wife when he sees an accident take place. He rushes over to help but one victim doesn't make it. A year later while working he recieves a call that takes him on a journey to save his wife and others. There are some sequals that change so much from the original that it's hard to see how the sequel fits the first one. There are some that actually continue the story and adds to the first one. Then there are sequels like this one, exactaly the same as the first. If you have seen the original then you will know exactaly what to expect from this one. I mean about 90% of the movie is the exact same, the only noticable difference is that instead of John Cena this one has Randy Orton. The movie isn't terrible but it's basically just a remake to a movie that didn't really need a remake. Overall, if you liked the first one then you will like this one too. I give it a C+.",1370044800,4,1055,4.076923076923077
5675822,3,B00BUH1QHS,"Nick Malloy (Randy Orton) is an EMT who hates chick flicks. He receives a phone call and is forced into a 12 round game or else his wife (Cindy Busby) will die. Nick has to follows directions and quickly find and decipher clues. We even get to see the man (Brian Markinson) making the phone calls to him. The question of ""why Nick"" is answered midway through the film, at which point Nick tries to go after his caller, while the cops go after him.

We have seen similar films as this one, which I thought were superior. Other than Nick being an EMT, this one brings nothing new and exciting. The film is mildly entertaining at best. It might make for an inexpensive rental, but lacks the quality for a second viewing.

They take the wrestlers they have and put them in movies and for the most part, not lying here, I have enjoyed them. they simply are what they are. Now in this sequel to the original John Cena movie which I did like. We have Randy Orton, always covered from head to toe, I think because he has tons of tats but so what. he is stiff but likable and as I said I was not looking for Oscar worthy performances.

12 Rounds: Reloaded was a really great thriller, action movie. Randy Orton is great as the hero, has the charisma and can really make u sink in his acting. The direction was very well done. The action scenes are also very well coordinated & the suspense of the story manages to keep you on the edge of you're seat. You'll always keep wondering ""Why did this happen? What's going to happen next?""

The best part of the movie is that it always has some fresh revelation or twists turning up every few minutes, to help keep you engaged in the films story. Arguably the films is better than the first. It has more action, better acting & direction. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED because of its actions and, more importantly, suspense.

5675887,4,B00BUH1QHS,"WWE Films continue to surprise, giving us a string of terrific action thrillers from an unlikely source. Their latest straight to video release is a sequel to 2009s, 12 Rounds. While Randy Orton wasn't nearly as good as John Cena was in the first film, he gives a more than adequate performance as Nick Molloy, a paramedic who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. After failing to save a rich mans wife at the scene of a drunk driving accident, the man decides to punish all those involved, including the paramedic who failed to save her. The story here is pretty solid, especially for an action film, but what bothers me is that this sequel was in no way connected to the first film. Reloaded is a different story in a different city, with an entirely different cast, so how did the bad guy manage to come up with the same game, from four years earlier? As for that game, the rounds weren't as long or as complicated, but what really makes this better than your average action movie is the compelling back story and the depth of the characters involved. Randy Orton, while having very limited film experience was pretty good and that will come as a surprise to many. It's hard to think of WWE Superstars as actors, but that is exactly what they are. Aside from wrestling in their underwear every week, they have to play a charterer and follow a script 52 weeks a year, so is this really such a stretch? For the most part the WWE Superstars have made for some pretty exciting action stars. The supporting cast of this film was also very good, in particular Tom Stevens, formerly of the Diary of A Wimpy Kid series. Stevens plays Tommy, another person caught up in this madman's game, and he is not only thrilling and charismatic, but he's pretty funny too. 12 Rounds 2 won't win any awards, but it is 90 minutes of non-stop action, packaged in a compelling story, which I found to be extremely entertaining.",1399334400,,1912,4.497126436781609
5675888,5,B00BUH1QHS,"I have to admit that this movie was a whole lot better than I thought it would be. Anytime you take a WWE star and take him out of his element, either something really good can happen (look at Dwayne Johnson/The Rock) or really bad things can happen (Triple H, anyone?). Randy Orton is by no means a great actor and comes off as a bit wooden some of the time, but given his in ring mic skills (or lack thereof at times) I did expect him to be a whole lot worse than he was in this movie.

If you go into this movie with rather low expectations as I did, you will find that you quite enjoy it. If you go into it expecting a blockbuster... then you will be a bit disappointed. I gave it five stars just based on the fact that for what it is, a low rate action film with lots of fast paced action, it did its job of entertaining me the whole way through. There aren't any slow moving parts which is a plus. The writing is rather lackluster but it seems most WWE films of this nature are that way. The plot is rather predictable but that didn't really take away from my enjoyment of the film.

So if you are looking for a fun, fast paced film that you aren't going to put too much thought into, this movie will fit the bill perfectly!",1398211200,,1230,4.036885245901639

This one had more of a story line in my opinion, and I loved the way it was constantly revealing more of that story line. I am an Action Movie Junkie, but this movie is not as action packed as most of movies, but I still loved it. I've already watched it twice, and I plan to watch both parts 1 and 2 this weekend.

The biggest surprise to me is the Randy Orton can really act. He did a great job! I thought that it was going to be all braun, to make up for the limited acting abilities, which is just fine with me, but Randy actually did a lot of acting, and did a great job acting.

I'm not sure what the reviewer who said that everything was so Dark was talking about, but maybe he should invest in a better TV or maybe some glasses. LOL!

5675905,3,B00BUH1QHS,"My husband is a huge WWE fan so I picked this one out for him.

We both agreed it was an alright movie just nothing spectacular.

Randy Orton plays EMT Nick Malloy and does an okay job at it. Brian Markinson does a much better job at playing the villain.

For an action movie, there were areas in this one that dragged along, seemed repetitive and boring at times. I was definitely glad that I didn't pay a huge amount to rent this.",1378166400,,432,4.180722891566265

5675907,3,B00BUH1QHS,"Randy Orton plays Nick Malloy, an EMT, who after going to a movie with his wife Sarah (Cindy Busby) is a witness to a car accident that resulted in a fatality only for it to come back to haunt him one year later when he received a phone call from a mysterious man named Patrick Heller (Brian Markinson) threatening his wife's safety unless he plays his game of ""12 Rounds.""  He has to deal with so many challenges both physically & mentally While playing the rounds such as figuring out what to do with the limited clues he was given, dealing with a kid he was forced to kidnap named Tommy Weaver (Tom Stevens), Det. McKenzie (Venus Terzo) & the police coming after him, and trying to put all the pieces together of what the connection is with everyone involved in the rounds including a missing Governor with Heller telling him that it's all about ""balancing the scales of justice.""

This was one of those sequels that has no connection to the previous movie past it being the same concept which in this case was having to complete a dangerous task in a limited amount of time or else face severe consequences.  This version of ""12 Rounds"" was heavily different than the first one as this was set to be more adult & darker with all the events taking place throughout the night, more foul language, some moments of dark humor based off the stupidity of Tommy, and an scene of simulated sex & nudity & drugs.  The first movie came off more like an adrenaline rush with each round being a more dangerous stunt than the previous one but this one fell flat to me so I would only recommend this for a rental or stream but nothing more past that.",1377734400,2,1640,4.420529801324503

5675921,3,B00BUH1QHS,"WWE Studios has a bad habit of continuing every franchise, regardless of whether the narratives match up or any of the original cast members are willing to return. They simply see the opportunity to latch on to any minor previous success in order to completely bleed it dry of profit. All of the straight-to-home-entertainment sequels from this studio have a recycled production line feel about them, making the product a shadow of the original product.

  The one perk that the studio has found from using a fresh cast with the sequels is the opportunity it provides for more ""professional"" wrestlers in the WWE lineup. 12 Rounds 2: Reloaded is Randy Orton's turn to step into the action hero role, with a terrorist-type storyline that is similar to the original 12 Rounds. Paramedic Nick Malloy (Orton) is pulled into the sick games of a psychopath (Brian Markinson) seeking revenge for an incident in the past, resulting in the title rounds. These rounds are not referring to the ammunition of a weapon, but instead reference the levels of the game that Malloy is forced to play in order to protect the one he loves.

  A premise such as this provides an opportunity for endless creativity, especially since the film is not tied down by anything from the original movie. It would seem that they could have had a lot of fun with the action sequences, but much of this movie instead quietly plods along the expected routes, hardly even making proper use of the set-up. Even for a sloppy sequel, too much of the film's action is completely forgettable.

  The Blu-ray release includes a commentary track with director Roel Rein and editor Radu Ion, along with a featurettes about Orton, the locations and the action in the film. The package also includes a DVD and digital copy of the film.

FOR THE REST OF THE REVIEW VISIT [...]",1371600000,,1830,4.762658227848101
5675922,3,B00BUH1QHS,"Who would have thought several years back that one of the biggest stars in movies would be a wrestler from the WWE? Most people thought of wrestlers as little more than muscle bound oafs with nothing going on except their next gig. The truth of the matter is that these members of sports entertainment do more acting in one day than many professional actors making it to the screen. So for myself I found it not too surprising that some would make it in movies. The Rock has done it rising to the top of the action film scene. John Cena was heading that way but seems to have disappeared. Battista has done one movie and is scheduled for another big screen film. And now they can add the name of Randy Orton to the list.

Orton stars in the just released 12 ROUNDS 2: RELOADED. Cena starred in the first film in this series where for one reason or another a criminal forces our hero to run through a gauntlet of 12 obstacles to save someone he cares about. It would have been odd for the same character to do so again so Orton gives us a new hero.

Orton stars as Nick Malloy, an EMT who witnesses a car accident while walking with his wife. He tries to save a young woman injured but knows there is no hope for her. Rescuing the young man whose car ran into the other, he saves him. But it's the loss of life with the woman that plagues him.

A year later and Malloy and his partner are called out to help someone at a remote location. When they get there they find a man with his mouth taped shut and something inserted into his stomach. Malloy's phone goes off and a man tells him to get out of the ambulance and move away, threatening to harm his wife if he doesn't do so. Malloy realizes he is being watched by things the voice says. When he hears something odd in the ambulance he tells his partner to get out but not before the bomb planted inside the victim explodes. Malloy's partner is injured but alive and the voice instructs Malloy to follow instructions to the letter, sending him off to a new location with only so much time to make it.

Eventually, as with the previous film, we have a villain who wants revenge for being wronged. In this case, and no this isn't a spoiler since we got lots of this in the trailer, we discover that the woman who died a year ago was his wife. Now he's taking revenge on everyone involved in the incident, from Malloy who failed to save her to members of the justice system who allowed the young man who rammed them to skate off with a slap on the wrist.

Going from one location to the next, Malloy must not only follow the instructions given (which of course include not calling the police) but try and solve the puzzle of who is giving the instructions and why. We viewers might realize early on but those in the middle of things are hard pressed to find answers right away. The villain moves Malloy to a point where he must take along a young man he's led to with him to the next stop.
This turns out to be Tommy, the young man who killed his wife.

But the revenge doesn't just involve these two. Along the trip the villain takes them down they find several others who failed to serve justice in this case, everyone from a judge to a defense attorney. No one will escape the wrath of this bad guy. With the clock ticking and 12 different goals to achieve, will Malloy be able to find out what is going on and save his wife, held hostage by this man?

The movie is quite well made with a technical quality some wouldn't expect to find in a modestly budgeted film. The acting by all on board is kept in check and Orton, while being his first time out, does show great potential to be another break out star as long as good projects continue to come his way.

While Oscar contenders won't lose sleep over films like this, movie fans will have something worth renting or buying the next time they go out. It delivers the action on all counts and makes an enjoyable film worth watching.",1371600000,,3934,4.2640750670241285
