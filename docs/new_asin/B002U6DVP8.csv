8381060,5,B002U6DVP8,"BOTH Season 1 and Season 2 of ""The new adventures of black beauty"" are highly recommended for family entertainment and for children who like horses.  The production qualities are very high and the scenic background of New Zealand and Australia is a treat.  Moral values are tops, too--emphasis on helping people and love of the land.

Horsemanship values are very high also.",1397779200,,374,5.0

8381062,4,B002U6DVP8,"This series was good, nearly as good as the old series before it. Plus having the woman that plays Jenny Gordan is back 20 years later is the same actress. And the same with her dad, Doctor Gordon. The landscape in New Zealand is beautiful. This was being made nearly around the same time or before the Black Stallion series was being filmed in New Zealand.

Jenny Gordon is all grown up now and married, but shortly widowed. She now has to look after her stepdaughter, Vicky. Many of the things that Jenny went through in loving a horse as a kid, she now sees Vicky doing it too. And the horse looks just like the horse she had a young girl, and name the stallion after him.

It's amazing how the horse always knows what's going on and helps out with the problems.",1323734400,2,765,4.305555555555555
