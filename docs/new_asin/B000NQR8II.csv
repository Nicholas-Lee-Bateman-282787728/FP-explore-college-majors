8180991,3,B000NQR8II,"I got this DVD mainly for the song ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"" and to see Bonnie perform live.  For some reason it won't play in my DVD player hooked to my TV???  I ""think"" this is a European format DVD although it was NOT advertised as such!  I'm not a DVD geek, I don't know how they are made, I just play them.  But it does play on my laptop and I can use that.  I would be Very Careful buying DVD's from this seller that might also be in the wrong format.
Anyway the song I got it for was great, Bonnie has sort of a ""gravelly"" voice which really goes will with Total Eclipse but makes some of her other songs sounds a bit weird.  Still I don't regret buying it and she is a fun perfomer to watch.",1477699200,,702,3.908450704225352

8180993,3,B000NQR8II,"Enjoyable, living here in the states it's pretty rare to see Bonnie Tyler live, so this was interesting. More of a rock edge to her shows; not all of the tunes I would have liked, but you know that going in when you look at the set list on the dvd package prior to purchase.
