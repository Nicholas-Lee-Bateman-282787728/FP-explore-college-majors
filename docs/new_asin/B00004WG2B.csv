1363708,3,B00004WG2B,"There is little reason why you should like the first movie without enjoying this one.  All the violence, sci-fi, and most of the sex is still  there.  This time, however, the movie is one full-length story.  The plot,  animation, and characters are very much in the same vein as each of the  individual segments of the previous movie.  The music is fairly appropriate  too.  In fact, the sequel is pretty much faithful to the style of its  original.  However, the story lines between the two are NOT connected. By  the way, Billy Idol is the voice of one of the characters...",967852800,4,575,4.584158415841584
1363709,2,B00004WG2B,"""Heavy Metal 2000"" is absolutely perfect for thirteen year old boys (who won't know any better) and other pervs that still have a picture  of that ""Star Trek Voyager"" girl stuck on their wall. Now why  would I say that? T&A, blood, guns, and outer space all done in the  most laughable way imaginable. If that sounds good to you, then you should  stop reading this and buy it; you'll love it. But if that doesn't appeal to  you (gee, I wonder why), then pass. This movie is drenched in sex. There's  as many sexual scenes (nudity, sex, and sexual 'jokes') as there is guns in  the film; and you have your predictable shower and seduction scene too. And  it almost worked for this guy too. But, I have brain cells and a love for  movies with an actual story in it. ""Heavy Metal 2000"" have  neither. The story was horrible. The bad guy has a key to immortality and  Julie (that was her name, right?) stalks him after he kills everyone in her  town. None of the characters are interesting except for the film's heroine  Julie. Julie is your typical cartoon version of Angelina Jolie (huge  breasts, skimpy outfits, always seems to lose her clothes, and a bad  attitude; just like Mrs. Jolie herself! (joke)) and is just as ridiculous  as Lara Croft. Her appearance doesn't bother me, but the film wouldn't have  suffered at all if she was a guy instead. Julie has a way of getting stuck  in a lot of ridiculous situations. For example, the seduction scene with  Tyler and the part were she has to kiss some alien slob to get across lava  (as Julie says, 'If this is what it takes to get Tyler.....' I mean, come  on! How lame is that?). And that's the other reason I didn't like it, they  should've concentrated on the story, not her. She does get extra points for  lame one-liners that actually work and, let's face it, any woman who could  kill Pikachu is a-ok. With the exception of Julie's voice, none of the  voice actors are convincing. Where's Matt Stone and Trey Parker when you  need them? The animation does help save the film. It's definitely not  ""Ghost In The Shell"", but it does look nice. Throw in some  computer graphics for good measure, and you have a slick looking film. But  not enough to save it. It gets boring often and you wish there were more  suprises thrown in (not that lame attempt at a surprise for the ending  either, that was predictable as well). You've heard me bash the film, so  why the two stars instead of one? Well, the action scenes are good, the  animation is good, Julie (so what if she's a cartoon centerfold?), and I'm  being really generous. I doubt I'll ever watch this again though, I'll just  stick with ""Akira"".",966211200,25,2657,4.464583333333334
1363710,2,B00004WG2B,"This film is better than the original Heavy Metal, which is not saying much. The animation is far superior, the story admittedly stronger.  However, many of the characters, including the heroie, are absolutely mean.  Julie is a strong character, yes. But does strong necessarily mean hard?  Her sister is much more likable. I hope Julie Strain is nothing like her  character. Also, there is too much gore. If you have to see it, wait to  watch it on cable instead.",965865600,,464,4.75
1363711,3,B00004WG2B,"This movie is OK, but the first one by far is better.  Some of the action scenes were completely unbelievable and although the surprise ending was  good, the movie has some pretty lame dialogue.

1363712,5,B00004WG2B,"If you are a fan of Heavy Metal... then you're gonna love this one! Although it runs roughly the same time as the original Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal 2000 packs a more powerful story, dazzling computer Special Effects,  and a much more artistically cleaned up backround and character design.  With the awesomely violent kill scenes, comes the best in hardcore heavy  metal music, that sets the tone for not only a great sequel.... but a great  film altogether. If ever in the video store, pick up Heavy Metal 2000,  youll like what you see! (Sountrack includes Billy Idol, Insane Clown  Posse, Panterra, and many more!)",964396800,10,617,4.828571428571428

1363717,1,B00004WG2B,"This was pretty awful.  As a kid I grew up on Heavy Metal.  I saw there was a sequel, and thought it might be based on the same premise--an orb changing hands in fantastic series of cartoons which are purposely not connected aside from the orb.  What we got was a run on of Taarna (aka cheesing in Major Boobage from South Park).  It's like they chose the lamest skit from the Classic Heavy.  I'm glad I watched it just for bragging rights, but I would not suggest it unless you are a die hard fan of Heavy Metal and want to see how they eff up the sequel.",1509840000,3,556,4.064220183486238

1363722,3,B00004WG2B,"as usual the art was fine, but was a serious let down from all the hype and build-up in the magazines.  even if she was my wife, i wouldn't have cast julie strain as heroine.  the cursing which is a staple of any heavy metal story line, didn't sound natural coming from her mouth; in fact the entire character script didn't sound natural. her character is in most of the scenes (about 80 or 90 %).

heavy metal magazine ran build ups showing side kicks, villains, and supporting characters to a story line that wasn't even close to the one produced.  the original main character hadn't even been promised to julie strain, so the pin-ups were much better.  the character didn't feel manufactured, since they didn't need to resemble the actress doing the voice over.  the story line was weak and miraculously the film was finished about the same time as julie's book/ portfolio titled something like six foot and worth the climb.  i wish i had been a fan of julie strain, but the couple of soft porn films i had viewed before that she actually ruined the ""sex scenes"".  maybe i'm overly crtical after that, but i'm pretty sure i'm not.

i also purchased the sound track for the four songs that i actually liked.  but unfortunately unlike the original heavy metal movie, the music selections didn't add to any of the scenes.  no tension, excitement, or anything i think they were purchased for the original 2000 version idea and kept for the version that went straight to dvd. i doubt that they will ever get their money back out of that film.",1504483200,,1540,4.5636363636363635

1363734,1,B00004WG2B,"Where to begin? How about: Boring, irredeemable mess?

I'm a big fan of the original Heavy Metal animated movie, that was a great montage of subversive stories all loosely held together by a common, galaxy and dimension spanning threat, but Heavy Metal 2000 eschews that format for a singular story that never seems to have anything to say, has no memorable characters, and stretches what should have been at most a fifteen minute sketch into 98 agonizingly long minutes.

As boring and trite as the story is, the animation and art direction are worse. Gone is the hand-crafted look of Heavy Metal, and in its place is some of the most generic looking backdrops and characters. On top of this is a liberal use of computer generated 3D models and animation for ships, vehicles, and a couple of characters that have aged about as well as you might expect for a something that was made circa 2000.

Who might like this? I have no idea. If you're fan of the 1981 Heavy Metal cartoon and are looking for a satisfying sequel I have no doubt you'll be sorely disappointed. Go watch that again or something like Rock and Rule and save yourself 98 wasted minutes.",1485648000,2,1154,4.619512195121951

Just like the movie Fire and Ice, the film had a unique animation style and fantastic character design. Definitely a rare gem for it's time. I never had the chance to see Heavy Metal 2000, but I did see some trailers for it. Before getting this, I watched some reviews on this film, some of the critics weren't too pleased but I understood why. The film's story, art and animation direction wasn't as strong as the first film. While taking all of this in I still saw something in this film that was still a great watch. I will admit that it was like watching something from the Saturday morning cartoon era,which was the best experience that could happen to a kid. Regardless of the cons for this film I still enjoyed it. The art style and animation was still satisfying, and the action was entertaining.

1363763,4,B00004WG2B,"Okay, first let me say I completely wore out the first Heavy Metal that came out on VHS, then bought it in DVD format, and I still watch it at least once a year. Second, let me say that --though I did like this HM 2000-- this sequel? Not so much. The first HM was ALL ABOUT THE MUSIC and the story(s) flowed along with it. The magazine, Heavy Metal, back when the first movie came out, was a great deal different than the HM mag that is being published today. Waaaay different. Find an old Heavy Metal mag from, say, 1978-1980...whoa...huge difference there. Back in the day, the earlier editions were...um...really graphic. I'm talking rated X graphic. The music on the first movie/album was all rock and full of the most popular jams of the day. And it was also very abstract with many different story lines going on at once. Now, this HM 2000, is all about Julie Strain doing a do-over of a PART of the first. Now don't get me wrong, if it weren't for JS, and her super posing and modeling skills (and goddess body) they would have had to BUILD a robotic model or CGI to match what Julie Strain could dish out. Most of the artwork was modeled after her real life poses and positioning (with very little enhancement needed) the woman, at the time of this version was absolutely bad! She was a natural at the ""warrior maiden"" thingy!! I kid you not! But not only was this run of HM kind of single track, the music was not as well known and fundamental to the overall outcome. It seemed to me that they tried too hard to make a newer, cutting edge, grunge-death metal-dirge kinda thing. It felt forced. It was still good though.

1363816,5,B00004WG2B,"To be fair, there are several references to the cult classic, 1981's Heavy Metal. Directly, the only true attachment to that breakthrough accomplishment was the sign on the Space Docking Port reading, ""Heavy Metal."" HM2K is loosely based on its namesake in minor and jumbled ways.
Tyler, the space miner, was nicely portrayed by Michael Ironside. His gritty, overbearing voice gave Tyler a presence of dominance and a general sense of evil to all whom he crossed. Finding the ""green crystal"" was similar to HM's Loc-Nar without any self-awareness. Yes, the ""green glow"" of the crystal was alluring and prized. No different from the Loc-Nar. But without that all-knowing evil presence, it was a huge departure from HM. In HM, the Loc-Nar sought its victims. Here the crystal awaits to be found before unleashing the evil that the beholder intends.

In this radical plot differential, the story played out for the entire length of the movie. I found this to be pleasing with just a single storyline to follow. Don't get me wrong. I absolutely loved HM for all it was and the variation of tales told. But it genuinely captivated me with a single story in HM2K. Once Tyler begins his transformation into a single-minded madman, he embarks on his quest for immortality on a planet further than his ship can normally traverse. All the while, plundering system after system, planet by planet, for his needs and psychotic pleasures.

Certain similarities between this and HM were closer in storyline. The lone survivor in the form of F.A.A.K.2. Torn out of the mold of Tarna. The whole badass attitude and take no prisoners methods. The Heroin who will become Tylers' nemesis. Never mentioning that ""green crystal"" again. All Tyler has at his disposal were the little viles to keep his superhuman strength up. To this point, there was little in common to HM. The stronger Tyler becomes, the more fear he strikes into those around him. Psychosis has nearly taken over as Tyler destroys all he deems unfit or unworthy. A definite reference to the drug culture that HM was geared for.

Opposite from Tarna who remained silent and stoic, F.A.A.K. is highly vocal. Bitter, verbally abusive and unafraid to speak her angry thoughts. No different than in real life, sometimes ones words can come back to haunt them. It does for her. To her credit and paired with HM, she is drawn with the perfect body. Like Tarna, HM2K has her dress out for battle with a G-String, red/black, thigh high boots, cool gloves and a shoulder cover. Oh yeah, a sword too! Clearly the animation was male oriented. Yet I needed to look closely over many viewings to see if any more connections were made between the 2 movies. Not many!

The ultimate showdown. Tyler has become of monstrous proportions. Wearing a fallen enemy's skull as a mask, bones on his uniform to be more imposing and a ""Punisher"" type insignia on his chest. F.A.A.K. is ready to save her sister and all that is good in the universe, all though I don't feel she sees it this way. Her little rock buddy (R2-D2 type) brings the light humor and her moral guidance. The insuing battle happens way too fast considering the hype to its culmination. F.A.A.K. wins and evil is locked away until the next time the ""green crystal"" is found.

For the musical scores, Thrash Metal was chosen as this was the style of the times. The majority of tie-ins were not in keeping with the action. I feel this was just in keeping with what worked so well in HM. I found myself adjusting the sound every time a tune played because the 5.1 Surround was so clear, it overrode the dialogue. Then raise the sound again when the tunes ended. The Superbits was revolutionary for the times. The look, feel and sound took me back many years!

This is truly not a sequel if one has those expectations. By name only, it is Heavy Metal 2000. HM is a series of vignettes that took the viewer away with several stories told by the all-encompassing ""Loc-Nar."" HM2K is a single story of a similar evil by suggestion alone. Again, were it not for that sign on the Space-Dock reading Heavy Metal, and had one NOT seen the title of this movie prior to watching it, I don't believe viewers would know it was of HM fame.

To me, I have always been a Heavy Metal fan. The magazine, the 1981 Midnight showing of HM, and this film. I have watched this for years back when my home theater system was set up for VHS. Since my Amazon purchase, to say I've watched it 20 times is on the low side. The cartoony feel is just how it is. It beats anything on TV these days! Should this become available on Blu-Ray, I will jump on that too!

So, if you want to watch a violent animated movie that is sexually suggestive, this is for you. Just don't run into this with expectations of a true ""Sequel"" to Heavy Metal. Far from it. Two separate movies where the second hopes you will buy because of the namesake. Trust me, it isn't. If you can rip yourself from that, your gonna love it!",1392508800,2,4964,4.594808126410835

1363854,5,B00004WG2B,"- I bought the new release of the original Heavy Metal and Heavy Metal 2000 at the same time. I found myself remembering almost every scene in the original movie, even though I hadn't seen it in over 20 years. Then I watched HM2000. About halfway through I vaguely recalled that I had seen it before, but there wasn't one single scene that I clearly remembered- and I probably only saw it about three years ago. It was that forgettable, that ordinary.
Don't get me wrong; this isn't necessarily a bad film. The animation is very well done, very slick and seamless. The writing and voice acting is competent and professional. The sound track is certainly better incorporated into the animation and story than it was in the original. Everything was competently done, it was just.... ordinary. Nothing jumped out at you. It was like a Saturday morning cartoon episode- just with a little more violence, and a lot more animated nudity (animated nudity- I mean what's the point?)

Personally, I'd save my money and buy the new release of the original Heavy Metal. Sure, the animation looks crude by today's standards- but it was done the old, time-consuming, expensive way of drawing one cell at a time. The original was also crammed full of a variety of different animation styles and story lines. Perhaps that was because it was the first big budget science fiction animated feature and the people involved had so much enthusiasm that they tried to do too much. In contrast, I don't think anyone got too enthusiastic about this film. Sure, they did a solid job of craftsmanship, but where is the originality, the fire, the spirit? Kind of reminds me of the original heavy Metal magazine, it started out fresh and new and just slowly petered out to nothing....",1356739200,,1756,4.757377049180328

Well... I was surprised. There is a storyline, there are well devined characters, it entertained me throughout the story. Al the ingrdients are in: There is a lot of dead people, the heroine is bad-assed as ever (reminded me a lot of Taarna, probably on purpose... No bird, though), the subtle and not-so-subtle sexual content is extensive, and the bad guy dies horribly at the end. What more do you expect?

1363874,4,B00004WG2B,"This is the not-so-spectacular sequel to the original smash 1981 film ""Heavy Metal"".
The original film was much in the style of the magazine-- largely episodic, jumping from story to story, very much like the original magazine, which contained several on-going storylines with one or two stand-alone stories. This film abandons that episodic format, and sticks to one story. Unfortunately it's very derivative of a story that was already in the first film, ""Taarna.""

Mildly adult in 2010, the animation in this film is somewhat lacking, as are original ideas, plot twists, the few nude scenes and single sex scene. This was all done in the first ""Heavy Metal"" and done better, as well. Too bad. I'll bet the failure of this killed the movie franchise for any further efforts.

It's always tough for a sequal to live up to the original, and only a few movies have actually done it.  All that said, it is a well-produced, cool-looking anime with, yes, a predictable but still interesting and fun story to watch.  It's biggest problem is that is needs MORE - more sex, more nudity, more story, more spirit, more everything.  The voice characters were pretty decent, but Julie's (main good guy) voice acting doesn't truly match her overwehlming beauty and sexiness, sounding phoney and hollow at times.  Michael Ironside (main bad guy) and Billy Idol have wonderful voices and are convincing actors.  The music is pretty hot also.  So, although it may not be as groundbreakingly good as the original HM, and does borrow heavily from one of it's plots, it's still fun-to-watch entertainment and worth viewing.",1248652800,2,975,4.866666666666666

While the animation and voice acting (including Julie Strain, Michael Ironside, and Billy Idol) is superb, the movie feels like it's missing something.  Heavy Metal magazine features multiple stories and therefore, the original movie's concept of having multiple interlocking stories feels more at home.  However, this movie does adapt The Melting Pot story and I feel they did a decent job.  Overall, the movie is fine, just nothing special like the original.

The DVD is a good pack though.  There are a couple of features dealing with Julie Strain and the other voice actors.  As well as an isolated music score, animation tests, trailers, and photo galleries.  The only thing really missing is a commentary track.

*Still a strong theme of good vs evil.
*Michael Ironside makes a cool bad guy, as always.

The Bad Things
*Much more goofy than its predessor ""Heavy Metal.""
*Has only one story line, instead of multiple short stories.  Could be seen as long and tedious.
*Main character seems ripped-off from the last film.
*Doesn't capture the rock culture as well as the last film.

Despite many shortcomings, I think this film is great fun.

1363909,2,B00004WG2B,"I didn't know there was such a thing as b-type cartoons but this one is definitely b-rated. If you know that going in, it's actually quite funny to see bad acting extended to cartoon characters. Lot's of blood and guts in minute sepia tone and of course a gratuitous boob shot (or two, or six) if you're into that.

Basic story: man unearths something he shouldn't have, it transforms him into an evil psycho who wants to control the universe or at least kill everyone in it who isn't compliant. There's also the added perk of living forever. He attacks a friendly planet kidnapping a teacher whose only surviving relative is a warrior woman with attitude and determination of her own. A big mistake he regrets repeatedly until the end.

What's good about it? The graphics are pretty good although the body movements are a bit stifled at times. I actually prefer the vibrancy of Titan A. E. If you're into metal music you'll enjoy the tracks too.

I have never seen the first movie so I don't have it to compare it to. Now that I've watched this one right through I wouldn't waste my time watching it again.",1196553600,,1107,4.525
1363910,4,B00004WG2B,"I've read a few reviews slamming this movie and the majority of the complaints are because it is not like the first one. This is not a collection of short stories but one story. It is based on a story written by the owner of Heavy Metal magazine Kevin Eastman and starring his wife Julie Strain. This movie is based on a graphic novel Eastman wrote called The Melting Pot. The only thing this movie has in common with the first one is the name and a few costumes from the last story of the first movie, Taarna.

With that being said I thought this was a great movie. The music and voice acting is solid. The animation is great and having the lead character based on Julie Strain doesn't hurt either. The story is ok but it dragged on a bit. My only disappointment with this dvd is the special features. They just don't deliver. This disk should be packed with dozens of features but it's not. The only features worth checking are the Julie Strain featurette and the isolated music score.

1363912,2,B00004WG2B,"Loosely connected to the first HM of '81, this sequel has a single tale of lust and immortality in place of the anthology of the older movie.  While mining an asteroid, one of the miners finds a crystal shard - the key to a fountain of immortality.  The fountain itself is on another planet thousands of light years away.  Unfortunately, the miner is played (okay, ""voiced"") by Michael Ironside and, faster than you can say ""Oh No, General Katana is approaching!!"" the key consumes the miner's soul and sends him off on a quest of conquest to find the well.  First off, he must ravage a remote planet whose few human inhabitants contain traces of an element that staves off death.  While successfully carting away most of the population of this distant planet, he misses Julie - a six-foot hottie with a big gun and a bottomless reservoir of rage.  The two battle across the galaxy - first to satisfy her thirst for revenge, but then for the sake of immortality itself.

Even having been warned, this flick is still a big disappointment.  The first movie was guilty fun - catering and yet lampooning the rock-fan in each of us.  The animation was crude, yet in a charming way that today's assembly-line animation or CGI will never know.  (Imagine a story built on all those way-out 1970's album covers, and you get the idea.)  With animation reflecting an era that predated Japanimation, ""Heavy Metal"" grew better with age - a time capsule of bad music and laughably bad humor.  The new movie offers none of that - no memorable lines, images or characters.  Though patterned largely on ""Taarna, the Terakien"" from the first movie, HM2 has none of the spirit or wit of the earlier story, and Julie emotes less character (which is bad when you remember that Taarna was mute).  In short, the movie offers less than a fraction of the entertainment value of a single episode of ""Heavy Metal"" the magazine.",1157500800,4,1900,4.666666666666667

Basically this is the type of thing that you might see on ""Adult Swim"" on Cartoon Network, which itself is kinda like HM (the magazine) at times.

As for the soundtrack, I'd consider it a bunch of modern but otherwise forgettable bludgeon-metal tracks that work as combat-sequence fodder but otherwise feel out of place (as with the first film.) Not a great movie, but decent.",1150675200,2,630,5.227722772277228
1363914,1,B00004WG2B,"...to see just how bad it is. Unlike it's predecessor Heavy Metal 2k has one single 90 minute story arch talking place in the far future, using both hand drawn animation and very bad CGI, bad even for 2000. The basic plot is that a miner named Tyler (Michael Ironsides) stumbles across a green glowing crystal that is a literal key to the fountain of youth. The only draw back is that the moment he touches it Tyler goes completely bonkers and starts killing a lot of people.

The ""Key"" draws Tyler to a settlement called Eden, full of people who haves traces of the life giving compound in them, giving them a healthy good looking looks, Tyler probtly kills half of the population and kidnaps the rest, a lone survivor of the raid Julie (Julie Strian) begins a blind quest of revenge.

Everything that could be bad in any given movie is bad in HM2K, the dialog is terrible, both written and performed, the camera work is terrible, there's no back story to speak of, tere are loop holes that even a baby can see, not even a connection to the first firm with the Loc-Nar, which the key is suppose to be a shard from, except that it's green. Also there are not special features on this DVD!!!!!

I don't mind the violence or the nudity, in fact I want to see more of that in western animation, but this movie is just as forgettable as any other movie that Julie Strian stars in.",1149897600,5,1376,4.3671875

The story is nothing particular, but it's fun to watch. There is also a good heavy metal score that prevades the movie. Beware: it's bloody, politically uncorrect and with a few nude scenes.",1126483200,4,490,4.455555555555556
1363916,3,B00004WG2B,"I'm going to commit some class 'A' sacrilege here by saying this with no equivocation:  Heavy Metal 2000 is, overall, a better film than the first Heavy Metal.

Of course, that's like saying Ernest Saves Christmas is better than Ernest Scared Stupid -- neither Heavy Metal film is exact a great work of cinema.  But the improvements are substantial.  Brush past the sentimental favouritism, and the first Heavy Metal is really a primitive work even for its time, overlong, technically horrible, with a disheartening disregard for detail.  I rented both films this week just to do a comparison, and the first one doesn't hold up.  Its age is not an excuse, because its approximate contemporaries in animation, not to mention Japanese anime (which has always been decades ahead of the U.S. in terms of artistic variety), aren't even close to being so crude.  Characters' proportions vary from shot to shot erratically; the vehicles and creatures all look like plush dolls, so flat and monochromatic are they; and its ""vignette"" structure, while probably a little closer to the structure of the namesake magazine, merely adds to the aimlessness of the exercise.

Heavy Metal 2000 seems to have learned its predecessor's lessons well.  Technically this one's light years ahead of the previous one -- you actually see lighting design, proper mise en scene, and even some okay action choreography.  The first Heavy Metal's pacing looked like it was done by people with no sense of timing; when warrior lady Taarna swung her sword, you wonder why her opponents don't take the three-second lapse to duck or land a punch to her jaw.  The sequel's music is also better -- while I also have a sentimental memory of the first Heavy Metal's soundtrack, given my soft spot for Blue Oyster Cult and Sammy Hagar, that soundtrack also had Riggs (lame), Stevie Nicks (out of place) and Don Felder with ""Heavy Metal (Takin' a Ride)"", one of the worst attempts at hard rock ever recorded.  Heavy Metal 2000's soundtrack, a collection of industrial/modern metal tunes, is less prominent in the mix, but does fall into the right tone for the cyber-sex-violence setting.

If there's one thing this sequel doesn't improve over the original, it's voice work.  Why they cast Julie ""I Was a Penthouse Pet"" Strain as the lead actress is beyond mortal comprehension; the only reason any sane director would cast Strain is to get her to take her clothes off...and this is an animated film, for cryin' out loud!  Strain's voice acting is painful to listen to, sounding like exactly what it is -- a nude model with no acting ability, speaking into a microphone in the studio.  Michael Ironside provides some relief as the lead baddie, and Billy Idol's cameo voice work certainly draws a chuckle, but the first Heavy Metal's voice-actor list (John Candy, Harold Ramis, Richard Romanus) was better.

You might argue that any analysis or evaluation of either Heavy Metal film is moot -- this is supposed to be entertaining, brainless, sexist, violent, juvenile trash meant to be consumed like so much junk food.  But even in junk food there's good or bad, and I'd say this sequel fills the junk-food role better, given its better look, far superior action sequences, and more coherent story.  I do regret that they didn't bring back Taarna, the silent heroine of the first film.  Given the superior artwork of this film, she would definitely have looked hotter than ever.",1110240000,6,3436,4.911764705882353
1363917,3,B00004WG2B,"I'll give you a measure of how forgettable this film was- I bought the new release of the original Heavy Metal and Heavy Metal 2000 at the same time. I found myself remembering almost every scene in the original movie, even though I hadn't seen it in over 20 years. Then I watched HM2000. About halfway through I vaguely recalled that I had seen it before, but there wasn't one single scene that I clearly remembered- and I probably only saw it about three years ago. It was that forgettable, that ordinary.
Don't get me wrong; this isn't necessarily a bad film. The animation is very well done, very slick and seamless. The writing and voice acting is competent and professional. The sound track is certainly better incorporated into the animation and story than it was in the original. Everything was competently done, it was just.... ordinary. Nothing jumped out at you. It was like a Saturday morning cartoon episode- just with a little more violence, and a lot more animated nudity (animated nudity- I mean what's the point?)
Personally, I'd save my money and buy the new release of the original Heavy Metal. Sure, the animation looks crude by today's standards- but it was done the old, time-consuming, expensive way of drawing one cell at a time. The original was also crammed full of a variety of different animation styles and story lines. Perhaps that was because it was the first big budget science fiction animated feature and the people involved had so much enthusiasm that they tried to do too much. In contrast, I don't think anyone got too enthusiastic about this film. Sure, they did a solid job of craftsmanship, but where is the originality, the fire, the spirit? Kind of reminds me of the original heavy Metal magazine, it started out fresh and new and just slowly petered out to nothing....",1077667200,49,1811,4.752380952380952

The first Heavy Metal obviously had some thought put into the scenes and the pace of the story line.  The artistry was phenomanal in the first movie, much better than the mish mosh of computer graphics and hand drawn animation in Heavy Metal 2000.  The first movie made sure the music reinforced and enhanced whatever scene was being played, the second, well the music really did not add much if anything at all the movie.  To sum up...boring plot, no imagination, and a sound track to not die for.  My advice?  Use the DVD as a coaster and read a good Frank Herbert novel instead.",1043366400,10,724,4.446969696969697
1363919,1,B00004WG2B,"Watch the last segment of the original Heavy Metal called ""Tarna"" instead. The plot scheme of HM2K is lifted directly from that. They took a tight short story from one film and stretched it out needlessly here.
The details have changed, but it's still the same story.
The same major plot points exist: ""Joe Nobody"" encounters weird green object that turns him evil. Newly evil bad guy slaughters docile people without warning. Babe in high heel boots hunts him down for payback. Bouncy cleavage shots ensue.
Don't get me wrong, I dig the cleavage... but no one actually got down and dirty. Onscreen nudity without sex = BORING.
Several scenes were torn DIRECTLY from the original movie's ""Tarna"" segment. Why do angry babes bent on revenge always catch the bad guys drinking at some dive bar?
The one scene that brought home the lack of originality was when our heroine FAKK2 takes a dip in a pool and gets dressed in a leather bikini to do battle near the end. It was a shot-for-shot remake of Tarna taking a dip in a pool, then dressing in a leather bikini to do battle in the original movie. I do not exaggerate, they both put on their Victoria's Secret battle gear the SAME WAY. That would have been fine if this was a true sequel connected to the previous story.
But this is not the case.
HM2K is boring. The attempts at jokes all fall flat. You can get more bawdy humor from an episode of South Park on TV. The action scenes are clunky. The ... shots do nothing to stir the libido. There are many other faults, but the main problem is that someone thought this was a great idea and decided to waste their money to make it.",1036022400,35,1628,4.448160535117057

Anyway, the plot is almost non-existent like in the Fast and the Furious but I can at least I can that movie without feeling nausated not so for Heavy Metal: FAKK2... Julie Strain looks great as animated ""shero"" unfortunately she doesn't get naked but only once and that's when she first tries to kill Ironside's voiced antagonists. I've forgotten the character's name because he made that much of an impression on me. Infact I've forgotten all of the character's names and all I can recall is the bloody fight scene towards the end as the bad guy was about to enter this temple and get some water so that he could live forever or some such nonsense and they were using swords and bows and arrows.  Yeah, this takes place in the future...okay what's with the swords? Oh and the monk turning out to be the REAL bad guy at the end...Gee I wasn't expecting that.
The first Heavy Metal was more of the rock opera and certainly enough adult situtions to keep even the lowest male life form interested but this sequeal to the classic seems like a rush job like getting a small Healthy Choice Meal after a long day of playing flag football when you were expecting maybe a Swanson's Hungry Man.

1363921,3,B00004WG2B,"The first Heavy Metal was in my opinion a waste of time.  They had six stories that were connected only by a strange green orb and other than that had nothing to do with each other besides sex and gore (which for some is a good thing).  Heavy metal F.A.K.K. 2 (or HEavy MEatal 2000) however is in my opinion the better film.  For one thing they focus on one story this time.  The story is about a young women who is out for revenge after an insane captain attacks her planet so he can find the secret to immortality.  He capturtes the people and kills those who defy him, or just some for the hell of it.  SHe seeks out to stop him and eventually tehy battle on the planet where the secret is held.
BEcause of the further focus on story that means that the sex and gore had to be toned down some.  Not to the extent that it would drive people away but just enough to tell a good story.

Of these ""required"" elements, it of course had to be science fiction, there had to be a lot of violence, plus completely gratuitous nudity featuring totally buff women with improbable breasts.  I like that a lot of effort was made to tell a whole story, but it looks like a bunch of producers got together, figured out the lowest common denominator for their audience, and dished out standard movie fare for them, cafeteria-style.

Our lovely Julie basically stops at nothing to fulfill her revenge, to bad that the character is poorly developed, all you see is a good looking revenge filled girl being mean to any male she sees.
The villan on the other hand is a little better...the insanity that drives him is made pretty transparent.
The mystical factor of this movie is also well done.

#1  The first one was an anthology movie.  Normally, I don't like anthology films, but for some reason it worked in ""Heavy Metal"".  ""Heavy Metal 2000"" is not an anthology.  For me, this made ""HM 2K"" seem a bit slow moving, but certainly not dull.
#2  The animation in the first one looked very comic bookish, which I feel only adds to the film's nostalgia and makes it more interesting to look at.  In ""HM 2K"", the animation is very stylized, making it look like an adult version of ""Titan AE"".  Again, I don't think this ruins the film, just makes it appear almost too classy to be a ""Heavy Metal"" film, therefore losing some of the ""get down and dirty"" underground animation feel that the original had.
#3  There are many styles of Rock today.  Personally, I'm more a fan of Classic Rock, Hard Rock & '80s Metal, which are the styles that made up the original film's soundtrack (a very good soundtrack I might add, certainly worth buying).  However, the soundtrack for ""HM 2K"" is made up almost entirely of Modern Metal, or Industrial/Goth Rock bands such as Coal Chamber, MDFMK & Monster Magnet.  Not that I don't like those bands or the sound of the music they play, I just prefer the sound of the older stuff, which is sadly vanishing from the music market today.  Today's ""rock"" bands, in my opinion, are actually (with a few exceptions) nothing more than weak little ""alternative pop"" bands that like to pose as actual rock bands (Foo Fighters, Lit, Eve Six, etc.)
Anyway, that's my little spiel about ""Heavy Metal 2000"".  Again, I'd say that if you're a fan of the original, you should definitely see this one even if it's not quite as good as the first.  Even, if you've never seen the first ""Heavy Metal"", or just didn't like it that much, you might still find this one enjoyable.
At any rate, give ""HM 2K"" a chance, and see what you think.",989280000,3,2145,4.436224489795919
1363936,4,B00004WG2B,"This movie is superior to the original in the ways of animation, plot, and pretty much every other way, as well.  Unlike the trend with most animated films of this caliber, it is aimed for adults, just like the magazine it's based on.  It remains loyal to the adult magazine, which someone (I hope) would expect.  I think it's unfair to say it's a bad movie purely because it has gore in it, and because it's not a movie for kids.  I recall dark and suppossedly serious movies being done for the child audience like ""Batman & Robin"" for example.  Do I really have to complain about what a piece of ... that was?  This movie lives up to exactly what one would expect from 'Heavy Metal Magazine': Good artwork, good story, brutal but just good guys, evil and muderous bad guys, mellow satire, blood and gore, nudity & sexuality, violence, foul language, and loud music!  For the single reason that it lives up to the 'Heavy Metal' standard, that makes it a good movie.",989107200,,966,4.485714285714286
1363947,5,B00004WG2B,If you don't like heavy metel and sci fi...your not going to like this movie. It's based on the comic book heavy metal. The first movie didn't have a plot really but thats ok because the comic doesn't ethier. However in heavy metal 2000 there is a accual story you can follow and it's good. I can't give anything away because it would completly ruin the story for you. The animation is wonderful. They do a incredible job of mixing computer animation and hand drawings. So if you like sci fi and you like a dungeons and dragons type adventure then you'll love this movie.,983404800,3,571,4.447619047619048
1363948,3,B00004WG2B,"Lots of fans of the magazine remember the first Heavy Metal movie with as a ground breaker as one of the earliest adult animated featurs. Sadly, this movie has come way too late to even attempt to capitalize on the original.
Here is whats noticible

1. Fans of the first film may notice that a few ideas have stupidly been copied into the second film and therefore it feels like just a rehash of another story. No originality whatsoever.

2. Julie Strain. After watching the movie and the shamless Julie Strain featurette on the disc you will soon be asking yourself, ""why is this film centered around her""? Who Cares? Oh, wait her husband is Kevin Eastman the owner of Heavy Metal Magazine....Perhaps if he had concentrated on making a good film than trying to promote his easily ignorable wife....

.

Whats good about it?

1. For the most part, the story isn't bad but very simple and rather dull.'

2. The 5.1 sound and special effects are quite cool if you have a home theater system.

3. The heavy metal soundtrack is good but after a while, what a headache. There isn't a lot of variety in terms of the music.

4. The voice acting is ok but the dialoge? It feels like someone wrote this over the weekend.

5. The animation is pretty good and worth watching.

Customers who know nothing about Heavy Metal and are just animation curious, may find this film a little exploitive. Fans of Heavy Metal may think its just fair at best. If you wondering why this film opened only in Korea and then went straight to dvd, then watch it and find out.",978912000,2,1546,4.469750889679715

1363950,2,B00004WG2B,"Fans of the ""Melting Pot"" books by Eastman, Talbot and Bisley will quickly be disappointed.  The Heavy Metal magazine guys took a great series, borrowed the characters and rewrote the story.  Except for references to names and places, there is little resemblance to the original story.  If the objective was to tell a completely different story, Heavy Metal didn't need ""Melting Pot"" at all.

""Heavy Metal 2000"" fails to deliver what ""Heavy Metal"" did.  Apparently marketing didn't feel that audiences would be able to relate to non-human characters, so they made all of the main characters human.  In fact, there isnt' even a ""Julie"" in the original story.  I find it amusing that the writers didn't even put forth the creative effort to at least think of a fictitious name for actress Julie Strain (except for an awkward reference to ""FAKK2"").  Clearly this movie was produced solely to advance the career of this actress.  After all, I believe her husband owns Heavy Metal magazine.  This is an abomination to the legitimate work put into the ""Melting Pot"".  Eastman, et. al. should be ashamed for allowing this to happen to their work.

If you are a ""Melting Pot"" fan, please don't purchase this video.  It ISN'T ""Melting Pot Animated"".  If you are a teenage ""Heavy Metal"" fan and just want a little T&A thrown in, MAYBE this is for you.  You're better off buying the original ""Heavy Metal"" video as this is much, much better both in character development, as well as deeper story-telling.

However, I will say that the CGI animation was very good.  The character animation was rather flat (like your Saturday-morning cartoons -- think ""Titan A.E"").  Lots and lots of marketing went into this film, and they'll probably make more money on after-market merchandising.  The film, however, fails miserably to live up to the hype.  Many fans who waited for YEARS for this animated feature will be disappointed.",975196800,3,1910,4.909375
1363951,1,B00004WG2B,"Ok so why did Kevin Eastman destroy the Heavy Metal Magazine and culture.  He had so much to work with but instead decided to go the opposite of the originators.  Classic stories such as The Ape and Den are no more and instead we are left with a low quality B movie comic strip.  The new movie Heavy Metal F.A.K.K 2 is a complete joke.  Instead of making a high quality A move he went back a step and created a low quality B movie that fits more into the category of higher end porn.  I have nothing wrong with pornography.  Whatever works for people is fine with me.  But Heavy Metal was never meant to be porn.  It was meant to have erotic images and stories but decent stories, not stories that revolve around some second rate actresses buxom.  Ever since Eastman bought Heavy Metal in '95 he has brought into a constant downward spiral.  Pretty soon the magazine will be so bad i will be ashamed just to buy for colorful toilet paper.  What it really needs right now are the classic artists and writers that made it great to begin with to speak out and admit that it is no where as good as it was.  Now it should be just labled as porn instead of fantasy.  I miss the old days of Heavy Metal.  We need a real Heavy Metal magazine again.  One without Eastman in charge.  One with decent stories.  One with the class and high quality writing that the originals (70's and 80's) had.  The magazine still has a lot of potential if we can get a decent lead editor in charge of it.",974937600,2,1478,4.2178571428571425
1363952,4,B00004WG2B,"This DVD is definately worth purchasing but not for the movie (explained at the end).
Heavy Metal 2000 is a linear plot about a woman seeking revenge on a lunatic, posessed by an alien power, who destroyed her home planet.
Standard science fiction plot with no twists.
The single story line is a departure from the vingette style of the original heavy metal movie.  This has the advantage of allowing a more coherent plot but has the disadvantage of not letting the artists explore as many different scenes and visual styles as they did in the original.  I think that the illustration style of the sequel is better but not as original as the first movie.  My personal pet peeve is the introduction of a poorly done CGI (computer generated image) at the end.  Gimmicky and not effective.
The sound effects are well done if you have a digital surround sound arrangement.  However, the highlight of the movie is the great hard core soundtrack.  Changing the DVD to the isolated sound track and just playing it for the music is well worth it.
But the best reason to buy the DVD is the featurette on Julie Strain.  I was not previously a fan of Julie Strain (didn't know her) but this woman is amazing.  Her personality is captivating and her blunt, honest interview is a treat to watch.  I can understand why she has a loyal following.",974851200,,1331,4.582278481012659

The update to Heavy Metal has a quality feel to it, the sound quality is good compared to the original, the animation quality is better than the original, and the intergrated 3D animation was well done.

Now i can see why this film was never released theatrically.  The 2D Animation reminds me of saturday morning cartoons..  The 3D animation for the spaceships doesn't blend well with the 2D stuff. What's with all the fade to black after every other scene ? Felt like i was watching something on tv with the commercials missing. Music snippets didn't last too long.. all around crap... I love the sndtrk... I still buy the magazine... And yeah I own the DVD and wouldn't give it up.

1363956,4,B00004WG2B,"The first installment of Heavy Metal was far superior to this movie, but Heavy Metal 2000 is a very respectable effort.  True, the storyline is similar (there's even a part that is a direct copy of the Taarna battle suit dressing sequence) to past plotlines in movies of this genre of films, but the story and action is enough to keep and hold your interest.
The video graphics in this movie are incredible, a seamless blend of cgi and traditional animation.  The sound quality is excellent. I am not a heavy metal music fan of any sort, but the music in this movie is great.
If you're the type that likes women whose bodies defy gravity, this movie has it, the women are incredible.  There is nudity spread thoroughout, but the sex is not graphic in nature.  This film is extremely a parental discretion advised, I strongly recommend it for the 18+ crowd. The violence on the other hand is very graphic, even more so than the first Heavy Metal movie.
I've read the other reviews so I'll not repeat the plotline for this movie.  I recommend this movie to those who enjoy a ""different"" kind of movie.  This is an adult animated comic book well worth viewing if you enjoy the Heavy Metal magazine offerings.
I have the DVD version and highly recommend this movie (or any movie for that matter) in this format for the extras as well as the superb video and audio quality.",971740800,18,1368,4.518218623481781
