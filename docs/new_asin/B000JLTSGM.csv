So, I had to watch it a second time to ""get it."" Not every-one's cup of tea, unless you are into very subtle messages delivered in a bizarre fashion. Overall, highly recommended!",1294012800,,315,4.851851851851852
8152028,5,B000JLTSGM,"This film has ""indie"" written all over it. But it doesn't make it any less of a great work of art.

The late Victor Argo's performance was wonderful. He brilliantly conveyed the emotional turmoil of a man who not only had to face the reality of everything he knew and loved changing and dying around him, but the responsibility and enormity of his visions. He has no idea why this is happening to him, and does not want the responsibility of these visions. It's driving him crazy and ruining his business and his social standing in the criminal world he once commanded respect in. Yet the inexorable pull of his destiny takes him into a different world, and transforms him forever.

There is a strong undercurrent of raw emotional honesty in the film. Argo projects the real feelings that his character experiences brilliantly. It's nearly impossible to avoid experiencing an empathy with his struggles.

It was also done completely in digital; at a time when this was not the norm. The director handled this uncharted territory very well.

Films like this are rare. And frankly, director Art Jones, and Victor Argo deserve more recognition for this film than they received for it.",1260835200,2,1181,4.8316831683168315
