237345,1,6300214893,"Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong exhaust their audience goodwill with this glorified home movie shot in fun-filled Amsterdam. Barely released in 1983, ""Still Smokin"" represents the absolute nadir of the team's film career. The so-called ""plot"" fits on the back of a match box, with no laughs or production values in sight. Allegedly directed by Chong, who lets the camera run for endless stretches of boredom. Someone should have smoked the negative.",1289952000,3,446,5.208333333333333

Scenes that made me laugh immensely were when Chong comes in Without his glasses into the Sweat Lodge and starts talking about a Star wars parody based on a gay couple(in front of a bunch of dudes in there), then the part were he's telling Cheech another idea, and there are Nude Buxom women behind them! Cheech looking on and Chong not knowing! Also the Telethon to save all the dopers of the world!  The movie might not be in the same mold so to speak of the 1st one, but I was not disappointed, I found it very funny!",1259107200,2,711,4.345864661654136
237347,1,6300214893,"Movie rates 1 star; DVD transfer rates 3 stars.

I was a big fan of C&C, and their first two movies were some of the funniest of the era.  Unfortunately, it appears the ""empty suits"" running the studios thought they could do humor better that Cheech and Chong.

This movie really proves that a central plot is vital for any film.  Our boys find themselves in Amsterdam and basically are pushed through a series of disjointed sub-plots, actually sight gags, that are non-original and decidedly unfunny.  Cheech and Chong are the funny elements in their movies; here, they are nothing but witnesses to silliness.  The unconnected nature of the gags leave you wondering what the heck is going on.

Sad to say, the C&C heyday is over.  Why take them out of So. California?  Better than any comedians filming So. California, C&C knew their turf; a lot of their humor came as spoofs of the 1970's SoCal culture.  If you love the boys, skip this movie.

Note added May 2010:  I have just learned that Tommy Chong was compelled to desert America in order to escape a drug charge.  The charges were subsequently dropped.  However, this news does not change my opinion of this turkey movie.  It lacks C&C's trademark originality.",1200873600,2,1219,4.710900473933649

237349,2,6300214893,"This is not a particularly good movie, even for die hard Cheech and Chong fans.  I really like their first 4 films, and this one starts out pretty well.  It has that slow, leisurely feel that the other Tommy Chong directed films do, and some of the scenes are hilarious, but it's a cheat at the end, where they just fill out the film with a 20 minute concert.  While much of the concert footage is good, it feels tacked on.  Cheech and Chong just wanted to pad their film out to a feature length running time with it.  There are some surreal moments in the film, which makes it interesting, but overall it's really disappointing because of how they just seem to quit at the end of the film.  It's really lazy, haphazard, and just plain unprofessional.",1178409600,,751,4.405797101449275

237390,2,6300214893,"By the time I came to this movie, I had already gotten there first three. Up in Smoke was fantastic, Next Movie was great, Nice Dreams was good, this was was pretty poor. They get pretty desparate at some points here, and they constantly repeat chracters we've seen already.

The Low points are when they attempt to impersonate two homosexuals (badly), the astronaut which is Cheech miming for 3 minutes of in space, and then pretentds to jerk off at the end. Also, when they got to ""Harry Palms"" masterbating Champion, that was about as low and unfunny as you could get, just awful. All the points in the stand-up go on about a minute too long, including the fake nightclub. The people laughing at Cheech doing a redneck, had to have been payed actors.

There are some good points... not that many though. Maybe the wrestling scene, and some of the scene with Chong recording with a videocamera in the hotel room. They don't seem to do much in this. I wanted something different, which is what I got, but I didn't think it would be this horrible. These guys can do better.",1105833600,6,1073,4.525773195876289
237391,4,6300214893,"Nostalgia for my childhood recently caused me to buy and watch the Cheech and Chong movies (with the exception of The Coriscan Brothers).  Aside from realizing I shouldn't have been watching those movies in my pre-teen days, I realized how well done they are.  Most amazing to me was that they  held up one after the other, feeling not repetitive, though each of them is rather episodic. Most impressive was Chong's direction; he makes a number of interesting choices that elevate him beyond the status of writer/star who has enough power to direct; clearly, he took this role quite seriously.  The movies, of course, are not serious.  I rarely laugh out loud in movies these days, but I did at least a half dozen times in each of these.  The characters are not only given funny situations in which to work and funny lines to deliver, but each of them is presented with a kind of earnestness that makes them likeable, and the films all he more watchable.",1093219200,,954,4.648809523809524
237392,3,6300214893,"I was a fan of Cheech and Chong's records long before they did their first movie. The records were chock full of sketch comedy routines featuring a bunch of characters they created in their nightclub act.

 A common thread in most of the records were two characters called ""Pedro and the Man"", who became the basis of most of their movies.

 I bought this DVD just to get a chance to see of some of their old nightclub act. They do a few of their biggest characters, including Blind Melon Chitlins, an old blues singer and two dogs named Ralph and Herbie.",1091059200,3,555,4.411764705882353
237393,5,6300214893,"(...)This film is not as cohesive between scene to scene as their other films, but there are much more laughs yielded per scene without expectations.  Some of the brilliant scenes that reviewers have neglected to mention: the wrestling scene where Cheech and Chong fight an imaginary wrestler shows their brilliant ability for physical comedy, Tommy Chong's great impersonation of an old blues man (couldn't understand what he was saying for awhile), their impersonation of two gay performers bickering before their show, and many more.  Throughout all the scenes, they travel through many facets of comedy and even drama.

I would have to say that this movie wasn't their best but at the same time I have to say that this what Cheech and Chong are about. Their movies seldom tie together or offer great content except insanity.  From an artist standpoint, it is a unique and different form of comedy that one has to appreciate and that is what makes Cheech and Chong different from others.  This movie follows this pair to Amsterdam where they are mistakenly confused with actors and are offered a suite in a luxury hotel.  As by accident, their mishaps and silliness continue but they are probably not at their best of earlier releases.  As far as funny, well there are parts that are, but most of it is a bit rediculous.

The film focuses on the two and they're ventures before and at a festival in Amsterdam.  However, it is mainly a set-up for a movie where they show off they're talent that made them a success on stage before the movies.  Fascinating, to be sure, however the downtrip of this is that a number of the bits off and on stage in the movie just aren't that funny.  The two show they have genuine and remarkable talent, but the mark isn't totally hit like in the earlier 4 movies.  Best sequences though- Blind Melon Chitlin, the boobs in the sauna (why not), and the Detroit/Jamaican drug seller.

First the comedy tapes:  sister Mary Elephant, Basketball Jones, etc.  Then the OTHER movies:  Up In Smoke...Nice Dreams...Things are Tough All Over...Next Movie.  They've probably single-handledly stopped me from even trying dope (well, them and my mom's voice saying ""STOP!"").  But I cannot in good faith call this a shining moment for the doped-up duo.  I laughed once (the zit joke:  ""It looks like another nose, man..."").  The rest was quite painful (I have to agree with Maltin).  If you are a long-time fan then watch any other C&C flick and don't bother with this.  I guess there could be some unintential humor.  There's one scene in the hotel room near the part with all the animals having sex (did I just type that?  Er, yep...) where there is nothing happening at all.  I thought I had accidently paused my VCR.  Moments like this are Mystery Science Theater 3000 fodder for sure.  Also, the crossdressing scene in the dressing room is so incredibly UNFUNNY I figure our heros must have been quite fried at the time.  Otherwise they'd realize it may be time to either start over or just retire.  Anyway, I know both stars have moved on to much better things.  I'm glad...their other work - especially UP IN SMOKE - is a delight.  I even liked them in Yellowbeard (not universally considered a great flick but I know the dialogue by heart).
