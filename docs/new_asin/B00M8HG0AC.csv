8670739,1,B00M8HG0AC,"This DVD is an amateurish slide show of a small collection of images without even a soundtrack. A very poor way to view the work of Bob Carlos Clarke. Even the extras are silent slides, his biography is but a few slides with text on screen. No audio at all. There is no video, no interviews, no insights into the man's work. I could have done better with scans from a book knocked out of quicktime on my Mac. His books might be rare and expensive at the moment but you are better off putting you r money into his work in print.",1197504000,10,527,4.12621359223301
