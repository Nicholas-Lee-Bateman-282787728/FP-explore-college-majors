1820349,5,B00007LP8N,"Can you Spare a Dime?

Contrary to Mr Krab's popular belief, money and career isn't really everything. Sure, Squidward quit in anger because Mr Krabs thought he'd stolen the first dime he ever made (it's worth noting he's been in business for a long time). He'll survive without it! He'll have Bikini Bottom eating out of the palm of his tentacle!

""Spare change? ... Spare change?""

OK, bad example. But anyway, naturally innocent Sponge Bob lets Squid move in with him and treats him like a king. Also naturally, Squid takes advantage, though he doesn't ""want to be a burden"". How long can Sponge take it? A few weeks? Several months? Or so long that the old narrator gets tired and they have to hire a new one? The way I see it, there are 3 possibilities. 1: It's as good as Squidward the Unfriendly Ghost. 2: It's as good as Squidward the Unfriendly Ghost. Or 3: It's as good as Squidward the Unfriendly Ghost! (If you've never seen Squid crying his eyes out before, this is the only episode besides Dying for Pie that you can do so.) - 11 outta 10.",1132012800,,1053,4.44559585492228
1820350,3,B00007LP8N,"All of the episodes on here are from Season 3. There are some pretty funny episodes on here but if I were you, I'd wait until the Season 3 set comes out on DVD instead. Why? Well, because you get more episodes for about 25$ dollars more. Once all the seasons come out on DVD, all of these 8-episode DVDs will be no longer worth buying. Season 3 is scheduled to come out in October, so we have about 10 months still to wait. Anyway, here are the episodes on this DVD:

1. ""Krusty Krab Training Video""

2. ""Wet Painters""

3. ""Can You Spare A Dime?""

4. ""New Student Starfish""

5. ""Missing Identity""

6. ""Mid-Life Crustacean""

7. ""Kraby Land""

8. ""The Camping Episode""

That's all the episodes, hope my review has helped you.",1105747200,11,722,4.368421052631579
1820351,4,B00007LP8N,"The only reason why I bought this DVD-Is for my personal favortie SpongeBob cartoon, ""Can You Spare a Dime?"" In this cartoon, Squidward has lost his job working for the Krusty Krab, after he got into a feud with his boss, Mr. Krabs. Squidward becomes homeless, and ends up living with SpongeBob. SpongeBob Tries to help Squidward out in more ways than one. When SpongeBob felled down the stairs, he tells Gary, the cat-purring snail that Squidward is NOT a free-loader. Moments later, Squidward bosses SpongeBob after Spongebob gave him some lemonade. Squidward throws the lemonade, and asks SpongeBob for some soup. SpongeBob got Squidward some Alphabet soup that reads, ""Get A Job"", and then Squidward wants SpongeBob to tell him a story, SpongeBob gives him the want-ads. Finally SpongeBob Gave Squidward the remote, Squidward wanted to watch ""Oprah"", but ends up watching a sock-puppet show instead as he saws 2 fishes talking about JOBS! Squidward tells SpongeBob that this wasn't his show! Then Squidward argues with SpongeBob, and then SpongeBob shows Squidward out to the curb, drags Squidward Out of the pineapple, and then pressures Mr. Krabs to give Squidward a second chance. Evidentally, Squidward is back working as a counter worker and everything goes happily ever after. oh yeah, there are a couple of more cartoons worth seeing. ""Mid-Life Crustacean"", ""New Student Starfish"", and the ""Krusty Krab Training Video"". SpongeBob still remains Saturday Morning's favorite cartoon",1101254400,4,1490,5.264705882352941
1820352,3,B00007LP8N,"I started buying these ""compilation"" dvds of Spongebob back when the first one came out (Nautical Nonsense/Sponge Buddies)because at the time it was the only option for having him on DVD.  Of course a few discs later they decide to release the First Season set.  I can imagine some of you reading this have already collected all of these ""compilation"" discs of which this one I believe is the 11th but I have to tell you this one may be the most unecessary volume yet because not only does it contain just 8 episodes (like the previous SpongeGuard on Duty collection), but they're all from Season 3.  Meaning this disc will be obsolete with the release of Season 3 on DVD. Then again, by the time Season 3 is released all of these compilations will be obsolete.  Bottom line:  If you're interested in the season sets, there is no reason to buy these compilations.  With 11 of them so far, just about all of seasons 1-3 are out now (there's about 15 or so episodes that haven't been released yet).  However if you're not buying the seasons sets for whatever reason, it's not like you're going to be disappointed with the entertainment on this one.  If you only have a few of these ""compilation"" DVDs or none I highly recommend not buying anymore of them and instead investing in the Season sets if you like the show because they're complete.  Also I'm pretty sure the cost will be more effective when bought in sets.  You also cut down on the number of discs, they're organized better, and they're chronilogical.  The choice is pretty simple.
