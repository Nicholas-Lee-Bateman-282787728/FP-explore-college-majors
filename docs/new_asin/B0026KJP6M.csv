3854276,3,B0026KJP6M,"Our family have been big fans of MST3K since we first caught the show on the SciFi Channel in the late 90's. We bought quite a few of the one-movie DVD's and all 14 (so far) of the 4-movie sets. The Brain That Wouldn't Die continues to be a family favorite. We followed the ""boys"" to the Film Crew and own several of that series, though I have to say that while the off-screen commentaries in the Film Crew series can be as funny as the best of the MST3K shows, the skits between the movie segments generally fall flat. Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett just aren't as whimsical as humans as they were as robots. Unfortunately, the trio's efforts seem to be devolving in their third outing, The Rifftrax concept. If you haven't tried one, Rifftrax are portable audio commentaries to movies of all kinds (not just typical MST fodder) - that you can purchase with the related movie, as we did with Missile to the Moon, or download from the Rifftrax website and play on your iPod while watching a movie on your computer or TV. Sounds cool. Alas, the commentary on Missile to the Moon lacked the old MST3K snark. Granted the original show's episodes were always a bit hit and miss. In the subsequent 4-movie MST3K DVD sets, generally only one or two (at best) of the movies bear repeated viewings. I guess one can only take the Flaunting-of-Disbelief concept so far...",1258502400,6,1360,4.532520325203252
3854277,3,B0026KJP6M,"The RiffTrax soundtrack seemed to come across much quieter than the movie's original sound making it difficult to follow what Mike, Kevin and Bill said.  I was constantly having to repeat gags for my aunt who just couldn't hear what the Riffers were saying most of the time.",1257724800,,274,4.708333333333333
3854278,4,B0026KJP6M,"If you really miss the songs from the MST3K crew, then there's good news!!  Kevin Murphy does the title song before the movie and it's Hilarious!!  Then there's the movie, a typical outerspace tidbit from the 50's.  The silly plot is about two hoods who get rocketed to the moon along with scientists (the lone female on the spaceship wears Pearls and earrings with her outerspace jumpsuit!). They land on a planet with female-only aliens who just happen to be pretty women in skimpy outfits and high heels.  The head honcho is called ""The Lido,"" for some unknown reason and her crown looks more like a chandelier on her head.  The best actors are the tacky giant puppet spider and rock creatures who move faster than the stupid humans who are trying to escape them.  Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett do a reasonably good job.  The movie and commentary are tame so it's family-friendly.",1252108800,6,896,4.705128205128205

8352941,4,B0026KJP6M,"It was all about putting behinds in seats. Movie theaters needed pictures, any kind of pictures, to put on double bills for all those teenagers with free time and spending money; why else would anyone bother to remake 1953's low budget cheesefest CAT-WOMEN OF THE MOON as the even lower budget MISSILE TO THE MOON five years later?

As a matter of fact, CAT-WOMEN starred film noir queen Marie Windsor, and is a surprisingly watchable realization of a 13-year-old boy's erotic fantasy, which is more than can be said of the remake. Leslie Parrish has a supporting role in the 1958 film (she's the sympathetic moon maiden Zima), but she's the bright spot in a doughy cast of 1950s nonentities, including a bevy of well-fed ""beauty queens."" The riffers have fun with this picture -- maybe a little more fun than the audience, as the guys seem to be genuinely cracking each other up on the soundtrack.

The video resolution, in any aspect ratio, is atrocious. Then again, this is a movie about a scientist who builds and launches a moon rocket in his backyard, a pair of escaped convicts shanghaied into astronaut training, and a heroine who wears sensible white wedges on the moon. I should really just relax.",1448755200,,1207,4.742857142857143
8352942,4,B0026KJP6M,"I had seen ""Missile to the Moon"" years ago in its original un-riffed version, and despite being a dedicated devotee of MST3K and RiffTrax was somewhat dreading the experience of enduring this classic stinker again. The film is a typical black and white pre-Apollo vision of lunar exploration from the glory days of cheesy sci-fi. This time there is a brilliant scientist who has built a spaceship to go to the moon but the government wants to control the program. All this in from pre-NSA time! Was director Richard E. Cunha a visionary or what? Unfortunately two escaped prisoners on the run break into the rocket just as the good doctor decides to fly the moon mission himself that night before the government can step in. In total five people leave for the moon, but will all of them return? No spoilers here.

After arriving on the moon the explorers find rock monsters, which were by far my favorite part of the film (Gumby came to my mind for some reason,) a bunch of unlikeable backstabbing women headed by ""The Lido"" (after which the Boz Scaggs jokes became nearly constant to an annoying degree,) and a giant spider which was the funniest cinematic creature I have ever seen other than ""The Giant Claw.""

There is dancing of almost unendurable length, space suit thefts, diamond mining, love, loss, and general malfeasance aplenty. The film was no better than I remembered, but the presence of the RiffTrax crew really did make it nearly bearable. This isn't one of Kevin, Mike, and Bill's best movies, but it's inoffensive and amusing. Many of the riffs are good, but the underlying materiel is just so stupefyingly boring that I couldn't give it the five stars that I award the majority of MST3K and RiffTrax efforts.",1418515200,2,1728,4.756666666666667

8352946,5,B0026KJP6M,Being a long time Mystery Science Theater 3000 fan RiffTrax was just a natural love.  This film has more cheese on it than a pizza topping. From rubber suited Rock monsters of the movement speed of curdled milk to unitard wearing bathing competitors the moon is a bit odd.  The idea of using two teenage car thieves as shrewd and smart  ship's crew I had the best round of chuckles again as always with Rifftrax.  Such a stinker needs a good razzing.,1343347200,,450,4.451219512195122
8352947,3,B0026KJP6M,"To my knowledge this movie has been done before, by Elvira!  So having the folks at RiffTrax try to choke it down isn't a surprise.  The plot goes like this - two guys escaping from prison sneak onto a rocket in somebody's backyard.  A scientist who believes he can make it to the Moon without help or control from the government.  As the government plans to take over his project the next day, he kidnaps the two escaped jail birds to help him launch his rocket and go to the Moon.  He also ends up with his helper, and his helper's girlfriend, as they all end up going to the Moon.  Funny how the government told him they would be back in the morning but never left anybody to guard the rocket?  Well, anyway, on the Moon they find rock creatures but no Hercules, a city of women, and the black creatures.  Well, one creature which looks like a spider.  A spider if you mean one of those puppets from the Muppet Show.  Or maybe the huge spider from Ator The Invincible - you may know Ator as MST3K made fun of the Cave Dwellers which was the second film in the series. Sorry, off track again.
This movie was before sexism was frowned upon, so there is a lot of that.  It was like somebody was trying to make a Amazon Women On The Moon copy-cat but took themselves too seriously.
Sound bad enough?  Sad to say it is so bad that even Mike, Kevin, and Bill have a hard time trying to make it funny.  The movie is just so bad that calling it a B-Movie would be an insult to those B-Movies.  Outside of a few jokes dealing with Muppets, I can't remember much of the movie and I watched it about four times over the weekend after getting the DVD.  To me it was just amazing to realize that somebody made this movie - that somebody thought it was worth filming!  Also I seem to handle bad sci-fi better than other types of bad movies - maybe I enjoy pain?
You may wish to skip this set unless you are a fan of the movie itself.",1295222400,3,1922,4.154054054054054
