2456433,5,B000CCBCCQ,I really enjoyed this box set.  Now I have seasons 1 & 2.  Can't wait to be able to purchase all the other Diff'rent Strokes Seasons  on DVD.,1141862400,3,141,3.9642857142857144
2456434,4,B000CCBCCQ,"I'm so happy that this finally achieved release! A few months ago, I pretty much figured that there was going to be no Season Two release, for it had already been a year since the first season had been released! I had gone ahead and bought some of the old Columbia House VHS tapes with episodes from seasons two and on; but not long after, I learned this was going to be released!

I agree with another reviewer that the second season started off a bit slow. While I enjoyed the episodes about ""Arnold's Girlfriend"" and found the portrayal of the girlfriend's racist father to be relevant, I did not so much enjoy the return of the ""Hello Larry"" cast in ""Feudin' and Fussin'."" McLean Stevenson was a very talented man, but it seems generally agreed that this stage of his career was a weak one ... and in this character, his acting seems particularly forced and overdone. Or perhaps part of that is that the script for the show was a little unnatural and drawn out.

Now, to the GOOD STUFF!...My favorite episode from this season is ""Slumber Party."" Just the pillow fight scene alone makes it worthwhile somehow; but aside from that, the presence of both ""Willis""'s friends and Kimberly's ""Facts of Life"" buddies adds a certain dynamic element that is very effective....what with all of the fighting going on. Furthermore, it's a pleasure to see the late, very talented Frank De Vol in the role of the restaurant violinist who just can't get his song done because of the constant calls Mr. Drummond receives! ""Return of the Gooch"" is another episode with a lot of laughs. Just seeing Gary Coleman do his karate moves was great fun, and the actor playing the instructor also added a nice element. ""Big Business"" is also very enticing. In it, Arnold and Willis decide to go into business based on the brownies of their new housekeeper, Adelaide, but don't realize the dues that have to be paid!

DIFF'RENT STROKES was certainly a unique show. In many ways it was unrealistic, but it also had a certain idealism and positivity that makes it charming to this day. Of course, Gary Coleman, Todd Bridges, and Conrad Bain were all very talented actors who carried their roles strongly. Unfortunately, the writing sometimes had very noticeable gaps and sudden conclusions that made it hard for the actors to make it seem natural! But as with all sitcoms, there is a certain suspension of disbelief that the viewer has to have, so all in all, those shortcomings can be forgiven....especially given the positive message this show was aiming to send when others wouldn't take on that task. And most of the time, they did it with a lot of laughs! I'm speaking specifically of interracial relations. The writers and producers did a good job of handling the situations well, and presenting both sides of the issues. And Gary Coleman delivered so many laugh-inducing performances along the way!

I'm very grateful to have two seasons of this show on DVD now. I can only hope that we'll see more!",1141344000,4,2980,4.703065134099617
2456435,1,B000CCBCCQ,"...Not HELLO LARRY!

What a crock! They pop up like every other episode!

The only plusses: the slumber party with the Eastland girls and hearing Mr. Drummond say the word ""gonads.""",1138752000,4,181,4.806451612903226
2456436,5,B000CCBCCQ,"This is certainly a ""must have"" for any ""Diff'rent Strokes"" fan!!  The good news is that all episodes are not edited; they appear as they did on NBC in 1979 & 1980.  Even though there are no bonus features included in the DVD set, ""Diff'rent Strokes-The Complete Second Season"" still gets 5 stars for having all episodes complete and un-edited.",1138752000,4,344,4.716666666666667
2456437,5,B000CCBCCQ,"as a child of the 1980's, few shows inspire fonder memories for me than Diff'rent Strokes.  The second season is finally coming, which was long overdue for many of us who bought season 1 as soon as it came out.

The second season of Diff'rent Strokes improves on the first season.  Arnold (Gary Coleman), Willis (Todd Bridges) and Kimberly (the late Dana Plato) begin to grow up and tackle more serious subjects, while at the same time, far from becoming the ""very special episode"" haven it became in its later seasons.  As Arnold, Coleman provided countless laughs and smiles on many peoples faces.  While you can list everything you like about the show, there is no denying that without Gary Coleman, Diff'rent Strokes is not Diff'rent Strokes.

I urge every fan of this show, as well as fans of other Sony properties from the era such as The Facts Of Life, One Day At A Time and Silver Spoons, to purchase this set.  Sales for season one were apparently lackluster enough that Sony shelved plans for a lot of era shows on DVD,  the more Strokes sells, the better shot other shows from the era also have coming out.

So come January 31st, put your old white socks on with the red stripes and Jordache jeans, and pop open a can of Tab and relive the golden age of Diff'rent Strokes with the release of season 2 on DVD.",1136419200,17,1319,4.485355648535565
2456438,4,B000CCBCCQ,"The 1979-80 season of Diff'rent Strokes,the second,is not much different than the first. Charlotte Rae departed from the series after the first season to star in the DS spinoff,The Facts Of Life. Philip Drummond(Conrad Bain) and his daughter Kimberly(the late Dana Plato) are still father and sister to brothers Arnold(Gary Coleman) and Willis Jackson(Todd Bridges). DS continued for five more seasons on NBC then was moved for its final season in 1985-86 to ABC. Like CBS's The Jeffersons,this sitcom is not really ""black and white"",if you know what I mean.",1135641600,3,558,5.211111111111111

You completely forget all that when you pop this in the DVD player. Gary still remains the highest paid child actor in TV history and in my opinion,the highest talented.

2456510,5,B000CCBCCQ,"Should the title of ""Diff'rent Strokes"" had been changed to the above title for its sophomore season? Probably not. The second season of ""DS"" sees some important changes, which I'll discuss later in the review. Willis, Arnold & Kimberly haven't quite hit puberty, & that's a good thing, for this sitcom hasn't quite hit totally mature & serious subject matter this season - at least not 100%. There's the two-part season opener where Arnold enters the hospital for a kidney operation. He meets a cute neighbor Alice, who also has to have a similar operation. When Alice's father learns she & Arnold might share the same room, he changes his opinion. This was & is a highly controversial & serious episode that tackled prejudice & racism head-on. There's also the season finale where Willis joins a street gang despite Mr. Drummond's objections. There's still plenty of other great, fun episodes in between. There are also a couple of cast changes this season, as Charlotte Rae leaves ""DS"" mid-season to star in her own sitcom ""The Facts of Life"". Shavar Ross & Steven Mond make their first appearances as Dudley Johnson (later Ramsey) & Robbie Jason - Arnold's best friends. Future ""DS"" co-star Mary Ann Mobley makes an appearance as Arnold's teacher in the same episode. Oh, & the theme of responsibility is tackled during this season as well, as Willis gets his first taste of employment, working at an auto-body shop (with nearly disastrous results). This is the first season we are introduced to housekeeper #2 - Adelaide Brubaker (played by Nedra Volz). With plenty of laughs & scenarios to go around, there's enough here to satisfy everyone of any age. ""Diff'rent Strokes - The Complete Second Season"" is a must-have title that belongs in your collection ASAP!

2456522,3,B000CCBCCQ,"I bought Dukes Of Hazzard Season 1 new stacked box set at Wal mart, it was horrible so I made them take it back! I exchanged for Diffrent Strokes Season one.  I remember liking the show as a kid.  I still like it. This is a good family heart warming show.  It shows that it doesn't matter what race you are, you can love each other, and that is a great show that can say that.  But it still had it's issues that I didn't enjoy... For the most part, Seasons 1 was worth 4 stars and season 2 was worth 3 stars because Mrs. Garrett left half way through the season.  She was part of the heart of the family.  Sony is cheap when it comes to packaging DVD's.  Season 2 had major issues with it's packaging, but the seller resolved that issue with me.  I gave the seller a five star rating because they practiced good customer service.  Season 2 still gets 3 stars because of the issues I had with it, which I named.

I found the old original Boxed Set of Dukes of Hazzard Season 1 at Barnes and Noble on sale for $13.99 so I will be purchasing Seasons 2-4 through Amazon.  Thanks again Amazon for excellent customer service and the third party sellers as well thanks!",1367366400,,1162,4.1891891891891895

2456530,4,B000CCBCCQ,"DIFFERENT STROKES was a popular sitcom that ran for 8-years from the Fall of 1978 thru the Spring of 1986 pertaining to 2 African American boys from Harlem who get adopted by a wealthy white Park Avenue businessman Phillip Drummond(Conrad Bain)and his daughter Kimberly for whom the boys dead mother previously worked for.

During this 1979-80 Season of DIFFERENT STROKES was not only the season when this show started to walk instead of crawl like it did in its 1st Season, but this was also the season when their former housekeeper Mrs. Edna Garrett(Charlotte Rae)departed the show in the Spring of 1979 to co-star on its spinoff series THE FACTS OF LIFE which debuted on NBC in the Fall of 1979 since Mrs. G accepted a job as the house-mother for a dormitory at an all-girls only private school.

Therefore, Mrs. Garrett got replaced by Phillip's 2nd housekeeper Adelaide Brubaker(Nedra Volz)in this season and remained their maid until Adelaide was replaced by Pearl Gallagher(Mary Jo Catlett)in the Fall of 1982 when DIFFERENT STROKES kicked off its 5th Season on NBC.

This 1979-1980 Season of DIFFERENT STROKES also takes me back to memory lane to when this show was on NBC every Friday night at 8PM followed by THE ROCKFORD FILES at 9PM from September of 1978 thru mid November of 1979 and to when DIFFERENT STROKES was shown at 8PM preceeding THE FACTS OF LIFE at 8:30PM every Wednesday night when NBC had decided to move this show to Wednesdays in mid November of 1979.

DIFFERENT STROKES also made stars out of child actors Gary Coleman(Arnold Jackson), Todd Bridges(Willis Jackson), and Dana Plato(Kimberly Drummond)whom all became known for the ""very special episodes"" in which serious issues like racism, drug abuse, and child sexual abuse were dramatically explored.

Unfortunately the lives of stars Coleman, Bridges, and Plato were later bombarded by legal problems and drug abuse as the stardom and success they achieved while doing DIFFERENT STROKES went down the toilet after the series was cancelled in the Spring of 1986 after its whole 8-year run.

Additionally; Coleman became famous for his popularized catchphrase ""Whatcha talkin' 'bout?"" just like Higgins catchphrase on MAGNUM, P.I. was ""Oh My God""!",1344902400,,2227,5.05449591280654

2456544,3,B000CCBCCQ,"The Diff'rent Strokes DVDs (Season 1 and Season 2) were advertised as new, but when they reached me, all corners of the covers looked worse than ANY of the few used DVDs which I have ordered from you over the years.

In addition, I found the picture quality wanting.  In many scenes the white people have such highly colored complexions that their faces can only be described as ""hot pink.""

As far as contents go, most of the episodes are as cute as I remember them although I find Charlotte Rae's antics and voice sometimes a little difficult to take.  I know I am alone with this criticism because everybody else LOVES Mrs. Garrett.

Looking at the practically perfect family life of the Drummond family, it is difficult to believe that all of the children of the show had such troubles after the series closed.  For all the joy they gave to their audiences over the years, one would have wished that Dana, Gary and Todd would have lived ""happily ever after.""",1316476800,,962,4.563953488372093
