8479403,5,B005MJDW90,"I loved it!!,Such Awesome Balance of dominating violins.  I think Thielemann really captured the feeling of Franz Liszt Genius, the idea to make the whole song base around one theme, and to have it on DVD, all 75 minutes, as it sounds like a miniature song expanded and whole like a perfect circle. it doesn't sound separated, or drawn out, very collected, and very Organized recording!! Superb recording!!!",1509062400,,407,4.985294117647059
8479404,5,B005MJDW90,So this is a definitive Faust Symphony and the bonus is Wagner's Faust Overture. Take that Brahms snobs. Wonderful perfomances.,1481241600,,127,5.4

Wagner had initially intended to write a symphony on the theme of Faust but got no further than the completed opening movement and sketches for the second Gretchen movement. He then converted the completed first movement into an overture which was first performed in 1844 by the orchestra that eventually became the Dresden Staatskapelle as on this disc. After this, Wagner later discussed in considerable detail his previous plans to write a symphony on Faustian themes with Liszt who was later to become his father-in-law. Subsequently Liszt went ahead with a Faust Symphony mirroring Wagner's concept while Wagner himself re-worked his 1844 Faust overture with the final version of 1855 being the one heard on this disc.

The 1855 Wagner overture is an interesting and powerful composition on its own terms but without reaching the compositional levels of the overtures normally collated on discs of his later overtures (such as Tannhauser, Mastersingers, Flying Dutchman etc.).

The Liszt composition is extraordinary considering that it was composed in 1857 - only 30 years after Beethoven's death. With this work Liszt is clearly thinking in a totally different way and making considerable inroads into the Romantic era with its strong relationship with the literary world of the time. The orchestral palette reflects this too.

The symphony has four movements, the first three of which are orchestral and are character studies of Faust, Gretchen and then Mephistopheles. These make for interesting and convincing listening and is where Liszt initially stopped in 1854. Almost immediately Liszt felt the need for an extension to the work finally adding a short choral ending for solo tenor and male choir with a setting of the Chorus mysticus from part 2 of Faust in 1857. This completed composition is what we hear on this disc. Purchasers will find that there is a very informative booklet included with this disc that goes into much greater detail on all of these points and which makes for a very interesting and informative read.

The performance recorded here has clearly been rehearsed to the point where it seems very unlikely that we will experience a significant improvement for a considerable time. The concert was designed to mark the 200th anniversary of Liszt's birth and is accorded special care in all respects. The 3rd movement scherzo in particular shows the skills and tonal resources of the orchestra off to excellent effect.

All of this is presented in both excellent DTS 5.1 surround sound and stereo with great fidelity by C major, a company that I am beginning to respect as one of the most reliable recording companies operating today. The camera work is detailed without being invasive and the imaging is crisp and of impressive tonal range.

So anyone interested in investigating this rare, but very worthwhile coupling of two linked works should find this release very rewarding indeed. In my opinion it deserves to be seriously considered on the bases of imaginative programming supported by fine performances and with a quality recording to match.

Well, I think this is a fine review, much as I disagree with your assesment of Thielemann's vapid performance,

8479406,5,B005MJDW90,"For more than a quarter of a century, Leonard Bernstein's great CD recording with the Boston Symphony Orchestra had been my staple for Liszt's Faust Symphony. I was quite disappointed with the DVD recording in 1976 of the symphony by the same conductor with the same Orchestra... the sound was not as detailed nor had it the same wide dynamic range as the studio CD recording but what was worse  was the picture quality, anaemic and seemingly bleached of colour.
Now along comes this 2011 blu ray version of this Liszt's symphonic masterwork, with Thielemann conducting the Staatskapelle Dresden and my goodness the technical comparison with the Bernstein DVD is as night and day. Here the colour is vibrant and the contrast razor sharp and the audio simply superb, examplary dynamic range and thumping low frequencies enhancing the sonic experience. The choral part at the end is very well recorded too, with the tenor's voice contrasting dramatically with the lower register of the all male choir. Stunning, kudos to the sound engineers.
The Wagner Faust overture served as an aperitif to whet one's appetite to the main course, Liszt, of course. Thielemann after his really excellent Beethoven cycle,is wowing many music lovers as a great conductor and interpreter, this reviewer included. He doesn't disappoint here, and with the highly rated Dresdeners in top form, this disc is a keeper.
The first movement, depicting Faust, is well judged, varying in mood and nuance from introverted soul, to nostalgic dreamer and finally the swaggering life-affirming hero, the various themes and swirling motifs building up a powerful portrait of a complex man. The Gretchen movement is innocent and tender, Thielemann lingering on the sweet and lyrical notes in the first part and then with passion in the interplay between the Gretchen and Faustian themes. Loved it. The Mephistopheles third is weird, exciting and
altogether fantastic, with shrieking violins and baying woodwinds reminding the listener of Liszt's good friend Berlioz. With the
wonderful audio, this is exciting stuff. And finally the short but stirring choral utterance with the tenor and male chorus singing the
words from Goethe's Faust, ending the symphony with a glorious cry of triumph. A first choice Faust, period. Just get it.",1336694400,7,2297,5.191374663072776
