2382184,5,B000A9QKSM,"I've purchased both available seasons and am waiting impatiently for the third.  This is one of the funniest shows in television history.  It was way ahead of it's time, dealing with many social issues that are still relevant today.  But everything about the show was tasteful and, as I may have mentioned, HILARIOUS.",1139097600,2,317,4.943396226415095
2382185,3,B000A9QKSM,"The Bob Newhart show is one of my all time favorite sitcoms.  I could watch the episodes over and over again. Unfortunately the quality of the DVD's are pitiful. I give the show FIVE STARS, but the actual DVD only 1 star.  The DVD is plain with a very small label on it.  The picture and sound are about the same quality as the video tapes I made myself back in the 80's when I taped the reruns.  I feel as though many of these studios producing DVD's of TV reruns don't believe they need to produce anything of quality.  Just making the DVD should be good enough for the public.  When we love a show we run out and buy the DVD no matter how bad just because we so desperately want to see shows that are not currently being played on TV. I don't know what the answer is because I am guilty of this myself.",1138233600,14,805,4.063291139240507
2382186,4,B000A9QKSM,"A masterpiece of understated adult humor, epitomized by its low-key star, Bob Newhart, who could get big laughs reading from the phone book with his trademark stammers and pauses.

Supporting cast was remarkable, each playing to his or her strengths, gliding smoothly along the tracks laid down by the expert writing staff. Standouts? Everybody was a standout. Peter Bonerz as Jerry, the libidinous orphaned dentist. Bill Daily as the addled Howard Borden, airline navigator, bumbling divorced dad, and meal moocher. Marcia Wallace as Carol, confident, razor-tongued receptionist extraordinaire. Jack Riley as Mr. Carlin, the funniest self-centered jerk of the modern sitcom era. And Suzanne Pleshette as Emily, Bob's gorgeous, sensible wife.

The trick to the show's humor was that it seemed to rise naturally from these characters who, though colorful, also resembled real people. Nobody had to push too hard for a laugh.

Almost three decades later I still haven't seen another TV comedy series that possessed this one's unique tone of humor, an almost indescribable mix of the usual satire and sarcasm and poking fun at our modern life and lifestyles, balanced perfectly against warm-hearted affirmation of the bonds of friendship and affection that make life bearable. And funny.

2382187,2,B000A9QKSM,"As others have mentioned, the shows are great, even today.

However, the technical quality of these DVDs leaves a lot to be desired. The sound is poor - almost muddy - and is a very low volume. You really have to crank up your volume to hear the dialog. The video quality is about equal to that of a VHS tape on ""EP"" - not very good. The DVDs themselves have no labels on them - just plain silver disks with a tiny label on the innermost band of the disk. Disk three is actually a double sided disk - one side is episodes 17-20, the other side is episodes 21-24. Why couldn't they give you 4 disks instead of three. It just seems so cheap.

Hopefully the next season's release will be of a more professional caliber.",1136160000,15,716,4.181159420289855
2382188,5,B000A9QKSM,"There will never be another show like the original Bob Newhart show. Perfect cast, perfect writing, un-matched to this day.

2382189,4,B000A9QKSM,"Finally some extras; 5 episodes have commentary tracks featuring Bob, David Davis and Marcia Wallace, and Jack Riley on one.  The commentaries are actually pretty interesting, going into the actors, writers and directors.  Marcia mentions a great gag reel; maybe we'll get that in the next package. But sadly Suzanne Pleshette, Peter Bonerz and Bill Daily didn't participate; wonder if they weren't asked or turned it down. The ""making of it"" featurette (end of disc 3) runs 14 minutes and is Bob and David Davis recalling how the show got its start.",1133308800,6,550,4.967391304347826
2382190,4,B000A9QKSM,"This show is really funny, even though the pace is pretty slow (that's part of the appeal of that show : a witty, well acted show that does not rely much on physical comedy).

Reading the other reviews about the discs problems, I waited before ordering this set. I got it now (end of october 2005) and everything was fine : the discs I got are the right discs and they play well with a standalone player and with a computer.

The packaging is the same as the season 1 set : 2 slim boxes, one containing discs 1 and 2 and the other one containing disc 3.

Each disc is double sided and single layer and each side contains 4 shows.

The picture quality is on par with the season 1 set : that is far from great but with few problems. There are english and spanish mono audio tracks. Not too great there too but the material is pretty old and there's not much more they could have done with that.

On average : the set is just average (picture and audio quality are not great and the packaging could be better - a 3rd slim case for a 3 DVD set would not be such a bad idea !!) but the shows are really funny.",1130025600,9,1104,4.045871559633028
2382191,4,B000A9QKSM,"That's a sort of play on series, yeah know. Anyway, this set is strong and even better than Season One because with Season Two you get... commentaries! While they do seem to lag a bit (they sit and watch the show a bit too often) and there isn't quite as much info revealed as I hoped, at least the attempt was made.

It's strange to me how little the characters have evolved which may seem like a slap but truly it isn't, these ""people"" are just the characters they became. Bob is just Bob. He was Bob in the first Ep. of Season One and he is Bob here. There isn't that ""usual"" need to get Three Seasons under your belt before the characters find themselves (SEE: Seinfeld) which is great for people who don't have a lot of patience:)

I didn't experience the snafoo that others have of getting duplicate discs and everything about mine plays perfectly which is just another plus. I truly wish all companies *cough* Universal *cough* went through the trouble of ensuring trouble free viewing.

I must end this review with the thought that Suzanne Pleshette is a real cornerstone for this show and while so many seem to remember the ""neighbor"" or even many of Bob's troubled patients, I for one, will remember Suzanne's grounded influence that kept up with Bob Hartley and made him seem more balanced... not to mention she was/is a knockout;)",1128729600,13,1342,4.560165975103734

2382193,5,B000A9QKSM,"If you're reading this, it's probably because you already love one of the top sitcoms of the 1970s, The Bob Newhart Show, so I won't wax poetic about the greatness of the program.  Instead, I'll let you know that this was the 1973-1974 season, and it consists of the following episodes:

THE LAST TV SHOW  Bob's group has a televised session. A classic!
MOTEL  A pretty girl is after Bob.
BACKLASH  Bob throws his back out just before a planned Mexican vacation.
SOMEBODY DOWN HERE LIKES ME  A reverend takes Bob's advice...and it backfires.
EMILY IN FOR CAROL  Emily fills in for Carol, and Bob's not happy about it.
HAVE YOU MET MISS DIETZ?  Jerry and Howard both date the same woman.
OLD MAN RIVERS  Carol dates her much older doctor.
MR. EMILY HARTLEY  Bob feels inferior when he finds Emily's IQ is higher than his.
MUTINY ON THE HARTLEY  Bob raises his rates, and his patients revolt.
I'M OK, YOU'RE OK, SO WHAT'S WRONG?  Emily wants to see a marriage counselor.
FIT, FAT, AND 41  Bob goes on a diet.
BLUES FOR MR. BORDEN  Howard is depressed by news of his son's new ""uncle.""
MY WIFE BELONGS TO DADDY  Bob feels he can't measure up to Emily's dad.
T.S. ELLIOTT  Mr. (Elliott) Carlin dates Carol.
I'M DREAMING OF A SLIGHT CHRISTMAS  It's Christmas Eve, and Bob is trapped in his office when the power goes out.
OH, BROTHER  Jerry's brother shows up and takes over Jerry's life.
THE MODERNIZATION OF EMILY  Emily feels old and decides to update her image.  Yes, this is the classic ""T-shirt with iron-on decal of lips and a cigarette"" episode; aka: Chicken on a Stick.
THE JOBLESS CORPS  Howard becomes Bob's patient after he loses his job.
CLINK SHRINK  Bob's new patient is a parolee.
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS  Bob's new business manager has him living on a scanty allowance.
A LOVE STORY  Howard falls for Bob's engaged sister.
BY THE WAY...YOU'RE FIRED  Jerry decides to fire Carol.
CONFESSIONS OF AN ORTHODONTIST  Jerry has a startling confession for Bob.
A MATTER OF PRINCIPAL  Emily clashes with the school principal when she refuses to skip a student ahead two grades.

This was a great season for Bob.  If you enjoy The Bob Newhart Show, buy this DVD set; you'll be glad you did.",1123718400,94,2191,4.574742268041237
2382232,5,B000A9QKSM,"Season one was a great start. Season two (1973-1974) seems like they found what works best and even improved. Season three adds many popular people and maintains the tradition of good writing and acting.

Aside from the great acting one thing that makes this program work is that they pick on problems that one could actually face and show how absurd one can get before coming back to earth. There is everything from job loss to weight gain.

On this set of DVDs there are some commentaries; the commentaries are not as well thought put as they could have been, however they do add a dimension to the episodes. I hope they still keep going with the series.

We did learn that somewhere out there is a pilot of Peter Bonerz whom plays Dr. Jerry Robinson plays a more advances psychologist instead of a dentist. This would make a great extra.

2382235,4,B000A9QKSM,"The Bob Newhart was centered around the life of Dr Bob Hartley, a Chicago psychologist. Bob Newhart played him perfectly.

Bob works in an office with other doctors like dentist, Dr Jerry Robinson, (Peter Bonerz) and the receptionist Carol Kester (Marcia Wallace) and his weekly group meetings with Bill Riley, Florida Freibus, Renee Lippin and John Fielder. At home, they have a divorced air pilot neighbor (Bob Daily).

The second season provided plenty of guest appearances like Teri Garr, Michael Conrad, Henry Winkler, Ron Rifkin, Rhoda Gemingani, Martha Scott, John Randolph, Ann Rutherford, Raul Julia, Sharon Gless, Marietta Hartley, Howard Hesseman and Katherine Helmand.

2382254,2,B000A9QKSM,"The first season is a hilarious, warm, endearing, and timeless comedy. The chemistry is great and the stories are well done. This 2nd season feels like nothing more than an experimental money grab. Hey, let's try a bunch of things that do not work and coast through on the good will of what came before. The inclusion of Bob's sister Ellen is one of the most gratuitous additions in the history of television. Most of the time, this season has no resemblance to the show we have come to know and love. The tone is different and the characters are only the same at the threadbare basics. If one didn't know better, they could assume they was watching an entirely different show. There are a few diamonds here but you will have to dig past the muck and the slime to get to them. Two episode with his patients The Last Tv Show and the one where Bob raises his rates are wonderful. So is the christmas episode which exudes the warmth of the first season. Most of the rest are a lost cause. A big slump in the series.",1479427200,,1012,4.331578947368421

2382341,4,B000A9QKSM,"The second season follows Dick (Bob Newhart) and Joanna Loudon (Mary Frann) further into their adventures at their recently acquired colonial Vermont inn.

Jennifer Holmes, who played wealthy maid Leslie Vanderkellen, is no longer at the inn. She is replaced by her self-centered, often ditzy cousin Stephanie (Julia Duffy.)

Cafe owner Kirk Devane (Steven Kampmann) is his usual woman-chasing, non-committing self...until he meets Cindy. Can he possibly be serious about any one person?

George Utley (Tom Poston), the inn's handyman, has his share of disasters -- leading the town in a Thanksgiving parade that's rained out (""Don't Rain On My Parade"") and seeing what he believes to be a UFO (in season 1). But then he's offered a job as volunteer fireman, something he's dreamed about his entire life. Can George handle the job?

And of course, there's the usual array of eccentric and wacky townspeople and guests at the inn -- usually coming by just as Dick is busiest with his latest writing project.

Viewers young and old will enjoy this classic sitcom!",1435708800,,1061,5.074712643678161
2382352,4,B000A9QKSM,"I've been waiting a long time to say this - welcome back to Vermont and the Stratford Inn.  It's been six years since season 1 of Newhart was released, and I'd given up hope we'd ever see season two.  But thanks to the good folks at Shout Factory, we finally got it.

This was Bob Newhart's sitcom from the 80's.  In it, he played Dick Loudon, a do it yourself book writer who, along with his wife Joanna (Mary Frann) moved to Vermont to open a bed and breakfast.  However, life in a small town can get rather crazy.  Carrying over from season one are George (Tom Poston), the handy man at the inn, and Kirk (Steven Kampmann), owner of the Minute Man cafe next door.  He is a compulsive liar who considers Dick his best friend, a sentiment that isn't shared.

There was a cast change this year.  Gone is Leslie as the maid and in her place is her cousin Stephanie (Julia Duffy).  Stephanie arrives after having left her new husband behind and being cut off by her family.  She takes on the job of maid, something she is ill suited for.  She's used to having maids, not being one.  And yes, while by no means recurring, we do get to see more appearances by Larry (William Sanderson), his brother Darryl (Tony Papenfuss), and his other brother Darryl (John Voldstad).

So what happens this season?  Dick gets a chance to ghost write a tell all biography for a well known actress - there's just one catch, she only works with those she's slept with.  Stephanie has to face her ex-husband when he comes looking for an explanation.  Her old life comes walking back into the inn when her high school boyfriend and her high school rival show up - on their honeymoon.  Kirk is worried that a new restaurant will put him out of business and leans on Dick for support.  In another episode, Dick's hard work to meet a deadline is frustrated by a permanent border, a miniature golf course, and George demanding a pension plan.  The entire town gets invited to the inn for Thanksgiving.  And Joanna mistakes the interest of a college professor.

The show was not super big on story arcs (this was the 80's after all), however, there is one that starts party way through the season.  Kirk meets the woman he thinks might be the love of his life.  However, he balks when he learns that Cindy (Rebecca York) is a clown.  The entire arc with Cindy is not to be missed and are some of the best stories with Kirk from his two seasons on the show.

This season also introduces Michael Harris when Peter Scolari appears in two episodes as the producer for the local TV station with dreams of ratings gold and a ticket to a bigger market.  He would go on to become a regular on the show for the remaining six seasons.  Both of the episodes revolving around the TV station are brilliantly funny and not to be missed.

Overall, however, this season is still a step down from the greatness that would start with the next season.  Don't get me wrong, there are laughs, and adding Stephanie this season certainly helps.  However, she and Michael and Larry and the Darryls are the main characters people remember from the show.  When the rest of that list comes on board full time (or half time in the case of the brothers), the show just gets so much stronger.

Still, as I said, there are some good laughs, especially in the episodes I high lighted above.  The writers do a good job of coming up with some fun situations and witty dialogue.

The cast nails it and really delivers.  Bob Newhart's sarcasm and snark is perfect here, and the rest of the cast inhabits their characters perfectly.

Unfortunately, the set could be better.  We get all 22 episodes on three discs in full frame and stereo sound, which is in keeping with how they were originally broadcast.  There is nothing in the way of extras, but I'm just happy to have the set.  I'll take it without the extras.  My disappointment with the set is the picture quality.  There is quite a bit of grain and dust on it in just about every episode.  Surely, it seems like they could have found some way to clean it up more.  The episodes are still very watchable, however, so don't let that stop you.  Just be prepared for less than perfection.

Frankly, I'll take season two however I can get it.  Newhart is a great show, and it's nice to see some forward progress made on releasing this gem on DVD for the fans.",1434412800,,4346,4.422446406052964

released to the public.
And now seasons 3-4 have also been released, which is good
to see.
It is a pity that many people have had some trouble with their
DVD's, I can not complain about the video quality of the ones I
received.
I was a huge fan of the show back in the '80's, and once again,
like the laid back, Yankee, small town humor.
It is a time and place, many people would like to go back to, if
they could.
But, the only way we can, is to revisit those days through this series.
For the Kirk fans, this is his last season on the show, and we see Larry
and the Darryl's take over the Minuteman.
Enjoy their.....errrrrr cooking.",1422835200,,694,4.110294117647059

Unfortunately the writers keep the Kirk character in the entire season even using him in the final scene of the season.  He is not funny, just obnoxious and drags down every scene he is in.

Stephanie is not in ""full Stephanie mode"" yet and Michael (Peter Scolari) was introduced and makes only a couple of brief appearances.  There are a couple of good episodes, but it's not ""up to snuff"" in my opinion.  I'm anxious to see what Season 3 brings; I have a feeling it will be much better.",1414368000,,530,4.489583333333333

Just love sitting by the fireplace with some hot cocoa and marshmallows and watching and certainly enjoying this DVD. I couldn't wait for them to be made for the public and it was sure worth the wait. Naturally, these all came sealed in a box and the box was sealed nice and secure.

Once they got rid of the ""neighbor"" character and brought in Julia Duffy and Peter Scolari, it clicked.  I was never that crazy about  ""Larry and the two Darryls"" as the general audience seemed to be -- I thought they were a distraction for the most part -- unless they other characters actually interacted with them for more than just a couple of ""lines.""

Overall, this series had great actors, writers, directors and stories.  The guest ""guest"" stars were used well by the producers.

I waited years for the various seasons of the this show to be released so I could buy them for my dad, who is 88 years old. Shockingly, he no longer hears well. CCs do not work on a LOT of dvd players, so we can only watch series with SDH subtitles. Who do they imagine watches 40-year-old TV series, for gods sakes??? Teenagers??? Half the cast members are dead and a huge majority of the original viewers must be hearing-impaired. It's just thoughtless and greedy to release these old shows and, at the same time, make them completely inaccessible to the original fans.
It's not only mean (in both the monetary and moral sense), it's a crap business decision. They could sell hundreds more of these if they recognized and catered to the core audience.

2382578,5,B000A9QKSM,"These cherished sitcoms from a couple or so decades ago are sorely missed. This is when humor was still authentic, four letter words weren't part of standard vocabulary, and people like Bob Newhart knew how to endear themselves to their audiences because of their character.

Still waiting for more.",1400889600,,407,5.181818181818182

2382580,2,B000A9QKSM,"Unbelievable! I would normally rate Season 2 of Newhart with 4 stars.  But this set is horrible.  Everything that has been stated about this release is true.  Poor video quality transfer is true; but is not even the worst of this Shout Factory production.  They have edited episodes on the set.  As in episodes released for syndication.  Thus on Disc 3: ""Kirk Ties One On"", 3-4 minutes are deleted from the original broadcast.  You can check it on Youtube.  The first segment of the episode is exactly the same.  The second segment when Larry, Daryl and Daryl enter, is hacked to pieces.  Even the part when Dick Loudon is tying Kirk's tie, that is cut.  Absolutely a Grade D product.  Shout Factory even employs prevarication to excuse and confuse what you are viewing.  At the beginning of the episode, they state ""this episode is made from the best available copy"" or words to that effect.  In other words: ""this is the best we had, so we transferred it to dvd""
One has to wonder why they use syndicated episodes for some and complete episodes for others.  DVD promised clean, crisp releases of the shows we have enjoyed over the years; and the movies as well.  What has been delivered is poor quality transfers on a cheap format for maximum profits--(at least in some cases).  This is a primary example of defrauding the customer for a quick buck.
Unless you are willing to accept edited episodes and blurry pictures, do not buy this set!
I can only imagine what Season 3 shall be like.  Season 1 was from foxtvdvd.com.  Anything from Shout Factory cannot be trusted.

This was mostly due to the character of Kirk.  Maybe some people thought he was funny, we just thought he was annoying.  Still, there were enough other features in the show that we could just ignore Kirk.  That was especially true of the second season.

No wonder companies don't want to spend the money restoring these archived gems to put on DVD!!!  People knock the show because the technology back then cannot possibly compare to today.  People grousing about this nonsense is going to keep great archived shows archived.  Shows like Empty Nest, The Nanny and The Proffessor, The John Larroquette Show, Sonny Spoon and I bet you can think of a few more you would like to see from the not so distant past.

It's fascinating to see the tinkering with the show as it finds its way.  Characters are dropped and added as it becomes clear that Newhart is at his best when he's reacting to the craziness around him.

Aside from the absence of digital gadgets (we like that too) the humor is still timely. Every character is unique, and the writing first-rate.  We kept checking Amazon for Season 2, and were thrilled to find it. We're enjoying Newhart again - this time without commercials.

2382638,4,B000A9QKSM,"I am very glad that Newhart is finally being released, but it's too bad that more care wasn't taken to transfer these from better sources. At the beginning of the dvd's it says these were mastered from the best available sources, but there MUST be better sources somewhere! They are somewhat grainy, but I'll take it. It was a long wait for this show to see a dvd release, so if this is the best we can get, it'll have to do!",1394668800,3,425,4.195121951219512
2382639,3,B000A9QKSM,"As other reviewers have said, the audio and video quality of this season is definitely lacking.  That is a disappointment for certain, but it's nothing I couldn't live with.  No, the REAL deal-breaker for me was when I realized that at least two of the episodes in the set (""Kirk Ties One On"" and ""Leave it to the Beavers"") appear to be syndicated versions.  I could tell when I was watching them that they seemed to have some abrupt scene changes, and the running time (just over 22 minutes) was definitely too short since these episodes are supposed to clock in just over 24 minutes.  So, I went online and found the original full-length CBS versions of those two episodes (with the correct two-minute longer running time) on Youtube.

I'm not going to hurl any mud at Shout! Factory for this, however.  After all, they could only provide us with what the publisher provided to them.  At first I didn't quite get the message that appears when you first play each disc that reads ""The following episodes were mastered from the best available video sources.""  Now I understand that basically means ""This is the best we can give you, since the publisher provided us with junk.""  At least they were willing to resume releasing ""Newhart"" on DVD, since it had become painfully obvious that 20th Century Fox had no intention of releasing any more seasons.  I only wish that the quality had been better, and that EACH episode had been the original CBS version.  The packaging is a bit misleading, since it says on the back cover the set contains ""All 22 original episodes.""  I take ""original"" to mean just that, the ORIGINAL full-length versions.

The final verdict, for me anyway, is to not buy any more season sets of ""Newhart"" going forward.  I will just watch the rest of them that get released from rental sources.  That way I can see the shows again, but at a tiny fraction of the cost.  Since I'm only interested in owning original versions, why pay for these sets if there is going to be some edited episodes slipped in?  If I had known this going in, I would not have bought season two.  Hopefully this knowledge is helpful to anyone who feels as I do but has NOT bought the set yet.",1394496000,7,2186,4.561538461538461

I like the graininess it had from the use of film back in the day as opposed to the anti-septic looking video.
I can see some of the quality complaints in the dvd that some here have complained about, but it beats having nothing at all, so no complaints from me.
It's about time this series is coming to DVD. I purchased the first one years ago and thought for sure it would be the only one. I'm looking forward to the third season next month.",1394496000,4,617,4.282051282051282

2382655,5,B000A9QKSM,"This was one of my favorite shows in the 1980s and after what is on television today, seeing these again makes me long for those days.  Newhart was hysterical without having to use an off-color word or having to resort to a sexual escapade to gain interest. It was just an incredibly clever and wonderfully-written show, performed by an excellent group of actors and of course, starring the wonderful Bob Newhart.  If only life was as idyllic as portrayed in this show!  A definite keeper and a DVD I will watch over and over again!",1393804800,,532,4.578947368421052
2382656,4,B000A9QKSM,Well worth the wait. I'll probably be dead before the third season comes out. The disclaimer at the beginning says the dvd's were remastered using the best possible tape source. I guess that was a vhs copy hoarded by a shut in somewhere in Queens. Not the best. The program however is still one of the best ever produced; not like the filth CBS puts out now. It's also fun to try to explain to the kids why woman wore shoulder pads that resemble a forgotten coat hanger and enough makeup to seal out Katrina. The hair do's probably kept Aqua Net in business in the eighties. A timeless classic show.,1393632000,3,599,4.405405405405405

I was sorry to see the character of Leslie played by Jennifer Holmes leave the ensemble but she was never given the lines or character depth that she deserved.  Julia Duffy comes on great guns and it is clear the producers want her to truly be a main character.  Larry, Daryl, and Daryl are really funny but too much is made of them and they become, for me, a distraction from the show plots as they become a ""show"" in and of themselves.  When Michael enters the scene later Julia becomes even more hilarious as the two begin to play off each others hedonism and shallowness of character.  GREAT show!",1393459200,3,687,4.464

This wasn't the best season Newhart had, there were a lot of transitions in season two.  For one the Kirk character was very much the lost character and it seemed that the writers just didn't know what to do with him until the end of the season when they had him get married.  You see the real emergence of the Larry, Darrell and my other brother Darrell through the season.  And then there is Stephanie who was always one of my least favorite characters.  But on top of it all you have the genius of Bob Newhart, the chemestry between Bob and Mary Frann was great, and of course Tom Poston as George was amazing.

Forget about the other reviewers who nit-pick about the video quality, It's fine. There's a disclaimer right off the bat that tells you they did the best they could with what they had to work with. How can you fault them for that? Besides, unless you're a youngster who only knows HD, 3D, Blu-Ray etc. etc. you won't be bothered by it at all.

We have dozens of television shows on DVD, and this is by far the worst transfer that I have seen. Grainy, fuzzy, blurry. My eyes were actually hurting watching it (after a marathon 4 episodes).  Yes, I understand that it is standard definition, but other SDs do not look this bad.

I actually put it in my computer to see if somehow I got a bootleg (even though I ordered directly from Amazon). It reads as legit, but boy it looks bad. Shout Factory should be ashamed for putting out this great show with a poor transfer.

Great show, however, so I will suffer with it.

UPDATE: I e-mailed Shout! Factory and they responded: ""The second season of Newhart was made using the best elements available.  Unfortunately, those were video sources, not the original film elements.""

That would explain the poorer quality, I suppose.",1392854400,6,854,4.6466666666666665

2382679,5,B000A9QKSM,"NEWHART season two. Really!  Its still a mystery, but well worth the wait. Shout Factory gets winner of the century for this triumph. Not only is this disc at last here but everything about it is right. There is a play all function and where some of us like to have a looped sound sequence at the main menu to keep our players from turning off, some of us detest it (after nine hours, the suicide provoking theme to Two and a Half Men makes us want to jail Chuck Lorre) what they have here is a clip of one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written for television and we can listen to Henry Mancini a lot longer than a warmed over Monty Python bit that never leaves the I chord. But know that this loop is here.  Each disc contains about 7 to 8 episodes and though they were digitized from old masters, the quality is fairly good. The makeup and sweaters are going to make some of us feel old, but the writing and performances are as fresh as ever and we wish more than anything that todays sit coms were a fraction of what this was. But most of all there is the triumph that at last, this disc is here. We hope that the subsequent 6 seasons do not take as long as this one to come out.(The series ran from 1982-1990)

Bob Newhart has had a spectacular career. Point of fact, hes had four or five spectacular careers. In the 50s he was one of the top Comedians in the country, holding his own beside Mort Saul, Shelley Berman, Jonathan Winters Phyllis Diller and Lenny Bruce. In the 1960s came the first Bob Newhart Show on CBS. He continued his motion picture career throughout, always in memorable character roles, even as recently as last season. In 1973 MTM launched the second Bob Newhart Show in which Bob and Emily lived in Chicago and his sitcom not only held in the top five but helped to define television history. Bob closed up his psychiatric practice while, as he put it, We were at the top. Four years later he was back as Dick Loudon with his wife, Joanna and this time the formula set them in a Vermont Inn. Everything here is pure brilliance and the last fifteen seconds of this series is, without question, one of the most brilliant finales in television history. Newhart traded between number one and three with Cosby and Golden Girls throughout the 80s and helped define American Television. From that series came some American slang and coinage that remains viable today.

Hi.  Im Larry; this is my brother Daryl. This is my other brother Daryl.

I won't go into his subsequent series, Bob in which he played a comic book artist; were going to stay in Vermont.

Newhart is an outstanding sitcom and Bob Newhart had the formula down. He is the sane man, connected to reality and the real world and is surrounded by insane characters. He fully utilizes his trademark telephone bits that made him a star of the stand-up stage in the 50.s. The first season of Newhart is excellent- and the weakest of the entire series. The second season- for which we waited more than ten years (more on that later) The producers began to tighten things up with the hiring of a new maid, Stephanie (Julia Duffy), the spoiled socialite who ended her marriage to an octogenarian and settled on cleaning toilets for these people instead of returning to the mansion that is home in Newport, Rhode Island and being Daddys little billionaire girl. Stephanie is the cousin of Leslie Vanderkelen who was the maid at the Stratford Inn in season one, far too sane and far too much like Joanna to balance the series, Leslie has gone on to Oxford for the next part of her education. Some of the set issues from season one are resolved. The balcony above the front door actually LEADS to a hallway, though the hallway at the top of the stairs still sends people into an open area that must hang out over the driveway. The uncomfortable colonial furniture in season one is replaced with upholstered, tasteful furniture arranged into reasonable conversation areas for a lobby and perfect for playing various scenes.

The townspeople, particularly the Wannamakers become more regular and we get a wonderful deeper glimpse into the inner workings of this fictional town- though the opening credits show footage of Middlebury, Vermont and the town is in closer approximation to Dartmouth University than Bennington, so we know were in Southeast Vermont. We join the village at their pot luck dinners where Joanna takes a stand for the suffrage movement and brings the women out of the kitchen to eat with the men. Joanna again becomes involved in the local community theatre only to discover that they do the same play every year: My Fair Lady Without The Music. (It flies right by! said Mr. Wannamaker.) Even though Mary Frann, as Joanna, brings intelligence and, for the 80s womens rights, her desire to do good and to do it well brings about as much insanity as Larry, Daryl and Daryl. Stephanie, after a fit for a broken date, runs out in a snow storm and we have a three bears episode where she meets Larry Daryl and Daryl. Tom Poston- one of the most gifted character actors in history, continues to bring depth and love to the character off George Utley. Steven Kampmann as Kirk from the Minuteman caf is here- at least for a while- and is the same, funny, shallow, vane and selfish, but it is clear why he was not picked up and replaced with Peter Scolari, given the need to follow the solid formula of insanity to fit with the very impressive presence of Julia Duffy. We get to meet Scolari and we see Dick become the host of his own television talk show (a classic episode) and in fact as the season wears on Kirk does indeed grow weary. We are reminded of how, beneath her vanity and attitude during the decade that made blonde jokes acceptable (thankfully for only a decade) Julia Duffys portrayal of Stephanie has class and kindness. This is a brilliant sitcom; it is easily in the top ten off best of all time and everything about this much awaited disc set is perfect.

And so one final note. We waited for this disc for over a decade. We wore out three copies of season one while trying to track down who would admit to owning the rights to MTMs catalog (even Mary Tyler Moore claimed not to know) and as more years passed and more messages went up on the internet asking Why? Where? and What the-  we still don't know. This is one of modern days biggest mysteries and the suits who know the answers aren't talking. Either the wait between season one and two is the most brilliant marketing technique in history or the longest contract battles in history.",1392163200,7,6563,4.521482729570345
2382680,5,B000A9QKSM,"One of my favorite sitcoms of all time.  Every episode is a gem.  The first season was not the best and the re-tooling done in season 2 really did improve the show.  The regular addition of Larry, Darryl and Darryl was brilliant.  And the quirky townspeople ... love this show.  And don't even get me started about the final episode.  I do hope that remaining seasons will come out quickly now.  It was way, way too long a wait for season 2.

2382686,4,B000A9QKSM,"Newhart is just about my favorite comedy of all time. I was very happy when the announcement was made that Season Two was finally going to be released.

The DVD arrived today. The only reason I rated this a four is because of the poor quality of the film - fuzzy, jittery. It's a disappointment after waiting so long.

There's nothing wrong with Newhart - it's the quality of the film. I'll put up with it because I love this show so much.",1392076800,7,439,4.27710843373494
2382687,3,B000A9QKSM,"I just got Newhart Season 2 in the mail today. I have been a fan of this show since it first ran in the 80's, and I even recorded most of the episodes when they were first run on CBS. I am very happy that these are being issued on DVD after so many years.

My first reaction, though, is that the transfer to DVD is sub-par. This was evident when people were walking across the screen - the moving objects lost clarity. It may be due to how the series was originally filmed; the second season marked a shift from videotape (really evident in season 1) to film, but I have plenty of other series on DVD and I haven't ever noticed this effect before.

I also noticed a few glitches from time to time, dirt on the film, etc., but nothing I couldn't live with.

From time to time, I felt like the transfer was done by someone pointing a digital camera at a film projected on a wall or even filming a TV screen. There were a few noticeable jitters in the scenes. This could have been from the original filming though, I'll have to pull out my old VHS tapes to compare. The scenes seemed dark and duller than I remember. The contrast seemed off and even the colors seemed a bit wrong.

Given all that, I hope that the episodes are the full versions, not the syndicated versions (which were cut in time so more commercials could be added). Unfortunately my VHS tapes for this season are from the syndicated versions. At least the opening credits are the full version, not the shorter syndicated version.

I think the season was filmed before a live audience, without a laugh track. Although natural, it was at times disconcerting because some jokes just got a couple of laughs. I guess I'm too accustomed to either full fake laugh tracks or no laugh track as is common today.

Please note that I'm basing my comments on the first two episodes, I'm hoping they get better as I work my way through the season. The series is awesome, I just wish it looked better.

Edit: by the fourth episode, there was a change in the picture quality. It was clearer and brighter.",1392076800,39,2054,4.361256544502618

Kirk (Steven Kampmann) was a favorite of mine for his unstoppable pathalogical lying and narcissism. Funny character, but alas, he only made it through two seasons before being replaced by the obnoxious Michael. Michael never could fill Kirk's shoes.

The interviews I was able to procure back in 2007 with the remaining cast of this show were stellar, but because of Fox's inability to pay attention (or CARE), too many of the pieces we produced to perfection had to be put ""on hold"" (or edited to shreds) due to Fox executives not doing their due diligence ahead of time in regards to which actors were ""legally"" allowed to be seen on the Season One extras. More union and contract ""actor"" issues which could have saved me and my editors a whole lot of time and grief had we had been given the correct information from Day One - and believe me, WE ASKED every step along the way.

2382722,5,B000A9QKSM,"I have taken it upon myself to watch all the seasons of The Bob Newhart Show - a revisitation for me to a wonderful comedy I enjoyed long ago when it was first run. Back then, I was a young girl who enjoyed the show, too. But today, watching it as an adult, I see it from a different perspective yet still, despite these being different times then when the show was first made, I still find it refreshingly funny, well-acted, and realistic in all aspects.

The characters are all genuine, unique and funny in their own ways. They blend well in their story-line lives and I find each one to be absolutely great. Bob in his seriously funny ways - loving, adaptive & supportive Emily, Jerry in his almost believable dental humor and Howard's nearly childlike humorous ways - all amazingly work hand-in-hand to make a family-like group of loving, humorous individuals. Toss in Carol and her office humor and search for dates, Ellen (Howard's sister) is a frequent addition in this season and keeps Howard in good order playing his girlfriend ... not to mention Bob's clients like Mr. Carlin, Michelle, etc., who with their endless problems and good-natured humor make this show a hit today as much as it was back originally.

I highly recommend this series for anyone who is nostalgic for some good, honest humor as only comedies from the 70s could be, but also for those who wish to watch a ""laugh-out-loud"" sitcom that has clean, honest, genuinely funny characters.

2382726,5,B000A9QKSM,5 stars for the show and 1 star for it not being on DVD! I'm guessing the remainder of the Newhart series has not been released because of weak sales for season 1. Newhart season 1 was the least funny of the series. Season two Stephanie replaces her cousin and the series really takes off. Season 2 and beyond to its outrageous final episode are hilarious.,1352851200,,356,4.409090909090909

2382729,5,B000A9QKSM,"Dear 20th Century Fox Studios,

I believe I speak for thousands - perhaps millions - of people who would really like to purchase later seasons of 'Newhart' on DVD.  I will also echo many of the comments about Season 2 (and later) of the show as being even better than the first. The first season has its moments but the Michael & Stephanie characters really added even more humor to an already funny show.  I also think the writing got better with time, and the studios switch from using video to film was a definite improvement to the picture.

I don't think you will have a problem finding a substantial market for these discs.  Thank you.",1339718400,4,641,4.491379310344827

It would be understandable if it was a bad show...low ratings...not  many seasons...but the opposite is true. How could such an excellent show be on hold for such a long time? Look at what people have written here - these comments are from years ago, it's April, 2012, and still not even a whisper of the release of subsequent seasons! Does anyone have any idea of what we can do to put pressure on the powers that be to release this show? Really - I know there are other things in life about which to worry.  But when an escape is necessary and when a few laughs are needed at the end of a long day, this show can help. Ya' know, Amazon, YOU can be the heroes and work towards the release of this show! You can make your efforts public, start petitions, and we'd rally around you! Think of how proud your members would be, and you'd even gain new ones (the two or three folks who are not already Amazon members!). Think about it.",1335312000,4,1065,4.293532338308458

After the first episode they voiced their displeasure and said it was boring. Really, how can these shows compete with todays media and video games?

Unfortunately the media has always dictated to us what they want us to want. Wake up and get organized!!!!  Amazon should spearhead the movement!!!

I recall fondly the Saturday evening lineup of Mary Tyler Moore, followed by Bob Newhart and capped with Carol Burnett. That was an iconic lineup, possibly never matched since. Newhart does not disappoint, even 30+ years later. His wry sense of humor still plays well and the 70's cultural references are nostalgically fun as well.

This show, and this season, serve as an excellent showcase of the comedic talents of Bob Newhart.  You will laugh until your stomach hurts.  You will have to pause the show just to catch your breath.  The characters continue to develop into the wonderful people you can't help but love, despite all their shortcomings.  If you love making fun of movie stars, If you love firefighters, If you love clowns, If you love town theatre, If you love boxing, If you love beauty pageants, If you love public television, If you love birthday parties, BUY NEWHART SEASON 2!  If you love TV WEDDINGS, this season has the best one ever made!  If I could give this season 6 stars, I would.  This is must own tv.
Notable Episodes-A woman chases Dick around a NYC hotel room, Joanna brings Vermont into the 20th century (kind of), Joanna becomes her mother, We visit the mansion of Larry and brothers Darryl, Kirk meets his match, Dick punches out Joanna's professor, George becomes the towns #1 firefighter, Dick goes on TV, Rocketburger comes to town, Kirk faints, Dick is rejected by the beavers, Stephanie meets Michael, and George gets the surprise party of a lifetime.

Hoping the ""Newhart as a New England Inn Keeper show"" becomes available on DVD soon.",1170806400,,358,4.868852459016393
2382764,5,B000A9QKSM,"As funny as the first season was, the second season (1973-1974) of ""The Bob Newhart Show"" is even more hilarious.  This show thrived on a great ensemble cast and great writing, and after the first season all the minor hiccups had been worked out.  It is difficult to believe that this show not only never won any Emmy Awards, but was never even nominated for any.

Bob's patients play a bigger role this season, and in no episode is that more apparent than the first show of the season called ""Last TV Show"", in which his group talks him into holding one of their sessions on Television.  They are also very funny in ""Mutiny on the Hartley"" when they try to continue without Bob after he raises his rates.  Bob's sister Ellen (Pat Finley) makes her first appearance near the end of the season in ""A Love Story"" where she is engaged to be married until Howard enters her life.

There are numerous great episodes this season beyond those I have already mentioned, such as ""Mister Emily Hartley"" where an IQ test shows that Emily's is significantly higher than Bob's, ""T. S. Elliot"" where Mr. Carlin takes Carol out on a Date (Shirley O'Hara's first appearance as Debbie occurs in this episode), and ""By The Way...You're Fired"" where Carol's new romance interferes with her job duties.  As with the first season there are 24 episodes, but in this season they are smoother and more consistently funny.

There are many well known guest stars in this season.  Teri Garr plays Miss Brennan, a receptionist.  Mariette Hartley plays Marilyn Dietz who is fought over by Howard and Jerry after Emily sets them both up with her.  Katherine Helmond plays Dr. Webster, a marriage counselor that Bob and Emily go to when their marriage seems to be stuck in a rut.  Ron Glass has a minor role as an Elevator Repairman.  Raul Julia plays Jerry's brother who starts stealing Jerry's patients after Jerry put him through dental school.  Sharon Gless plays Rosalie Shaeffer, one of Howard's girlfriends.  Howard Hesseman plays Craig Plager, one of Bob's patients.  Henry Winkler plays Miles Lascoe, a man on parole for armed robbery who is one of Bob's patients.

Unlike the first season set, there are some extras included with this season.  There are five audio commentaries.  All of them include Bob Newhart, one by himself, one with Jack Riley who played Elliot Carlin, and the last three with Marcia Wallace who played Carol and David Davis who helped create the show.  The commentaries are not the best, as there are many extended pauses and some of the stories they tell they repeat on other commentaries, however, I still enjoyed listening to them because there were some interesting stories and information about the show.  There is also a short featurette on the show, with some interviews.  Again I would not say it was the best I have seen, but it has its moments.  Nobody should buy the set because of the extras, but they do add a little something to the total package.",1151625600,21,2963,4.710679611650486

Bob Newhart is priceless with his deadpan reactions, and everyone around him provides the perfect foil for his brand of humor. Fox has done a nice job with this DVD set too, giving us the best picture and sound quality we will probably ever see from these 1970s film elements. The menus use a cartoon motif that I think is silly, but that's my only real complaint. There are a few nice extras in the form of commentary tracks from Bob Newhart and others, but not much. This show is a real classic, and very much worth buying for a mere 20 bucks or so. I have seasons 1-3 and can't wait for 4.",1150156800,,735,4.219858156028369

The first season introduces all of the characters and their relationships, and by season two that was all set, so they just worked on being funny.  Bob's patients were pretty well established by this time, and they generated a lot more laughs than they did the first season.  By the time the first season ended, we didn't need them to explain to us who Mr. Carlin was.  They just brought him in, and let him crack us up.

There were also a lot of stars showing up in cameo appearances.  Terri Garr was outstanding as the dumb blonde secretary in two episodes, Henry Winkler was very funny as an ex-con patient of Bob's, Michael Conrad and Howard Hesseman were great as patients.

Unlike the first season, this disc does include a short extra, which is an interview with Bob and one of the writers from the show.

The collection brought back a lot of great memories, and provided quite a few laughs.  I'm looking forward to season three.",1145577600,4,1164,4.5

Much like the first season set I have not had any problems with skipping or freezing of any of the discs as I have with other TV series sets I have purchased.

There are no extras in this set, the main menu is easy to read so my 4 out of 5 stars is aimed just at the show itself and how it will always be a timeless comedy classic.",1142726400,3,617,3.7751937984496124

  This season (1973-74) you will see the Hartley's patio with wind, snow and while its raining.

  Brought to you by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment and MTM Enterprises,Inc., the 2nd season disc set is much improved over the first season set.
  Their are audio commentaries made in 2005 you may select to hear in 5 different episodes with Bob Newhart, Marcia Wallace, David Davis (creator of tv series), Jack Riley.
  The color print is fabulous, restored as close to as originally aired. However, you might have to turn your color down 8 notches so that the red and orange will look more natural. Red and orange should not look neon. You might have to turn up your brightness just for the DVD play too. I assume you still have an old tv set.

Video is sub-par too.  Too bad, this is one  of my favorites.",1526083200,,157,4.344827586206897

8076551,5,B000A9QKSM,"This is a very funny show. Also, the show is dubbed into Spanish with Spanish subtitles.",1524700800,,88,4.5625
8076552,5,B000A9QKSM,Great show! Funny and adult at the same time.  Wish they streamed all of the seasons.,1521417600,,85,4.3125
8076553,4,B000A9QKSM,"Classic. One of the best sitcoms of all time, along with Andy Griffith Show, Dick Van Dyke Show and Seinfeld.",1514592000,,109,4.5
8076554,4,B000A9QKSM,"Love the show but the video quality is less than stellar. It is however far superior to the downright awful video quality found in the ""Complete 1980s"" box set which consumers should avoid at all costs. I already had season 1 and instead of buying each season separately I bought the entire series at what I figured was a great discount for around $65. The first episode was all it took to realize the video was far degraded from the season 1 I had and when I compared discs sure enough the disc for the box set had been substantially compressed. I figured the same might apply to season 2 so I ordered hoping the individual season copy would be far superior and indeed it is, it's still not excellent but a far cry from the garbage quality of the box set. The manufacturer is the same for both and they basically went cheap by going with single layer discs instead of dual-layer discs and compressed the heck out of the originals to fit the discs. Total data on the 3 discs from the individual Season 2 is 20 GB, total data on the 3 discs for Season 2 the box set is 13 GB. The result is a glaringly obvious reduction in quality and I recommend anyone interested in buying the entire series to buy each season separately instead of the box set as the box set is pure garbage. Pay the extra money, it's worth it.",1513123200,,1312,4.294354838709677
8076555,5,B000A9QKSM,"Great DVD, love the dry, almost comforting humor of this warm show.  DVD is great quality, episode guide clearly printed on inside sleeve, which is something I always look for.  Episodes are complete and well-printed, I have not experienced any technical problems with this set.",1512000000,,278,5.155555555555556
8076556,3,B000A9QKSM,"A little inconvenient and wasteful that it uses 3 discs:  only 4 episodes each side,.2 plastic folding covers in a box.  I had the entire first season on the front and back of one disc.",1509235200,,185,4.257142857142857
