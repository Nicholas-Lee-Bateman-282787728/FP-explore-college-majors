3745384,4,B001PA0FHC,"""EXCELLENT CHILL""
Translated from the magazine 'Cinema-Russia'

""The talented screenwriter and director Chris Solimine is the most interesting filmmaker to emerge from what we like to call the ""Konchalovsky School"" of Cinema in Russia. Though an American, with Moscow Chill Solimine has made a film that is not loaded with Western banality, but filled with Russian color and flavor.
Like Andron Konchalovsky, Mr. Solimine takes the time in his visual approach to include interesting details, draw his characters well, and take us on a journey with his American protagonist.
There are several twists to the plot about a Computer hacker (Norman Reedus) brought to Moscow, which keep the viewer guessing. You certainly will not regret going to see Moscow Chill. It is a work that is sometimes tough, sometimes brutal, but always touching and sincere. In this cold winter it is like a warm, refreshing sip of good cinema.""",1240444800,5,918,5.1610738255033555
3745385,5,B001PA0FHC,"Moscow Chill holds your interest throughout the movie with its action- packed story line. Actors deliver a good performance, a sharp portrayal of the Russian underworld or dark side of life.",1238716800,,190,5.161290322580645
3745386,4,B001PA0FHC,"Moscow Chill ranks high in my personal list of favorite independent films. It has a wonderful blend of action, comedy, drama, and a touch of romance. The characters were well developed, likable and very well acted. Another thing I took notice in this film and in all films is the music. I believe music plays one of the most significant rolls in a film and I really enjoyed the selection for Moscow Chill.",1238284800,7,405,4.561643835616438
3745387,5,B001PA0FHC,"As far as low-budget films go, ""Moscow Chill"", is a stunner.''Hollywood should sit up and take notice - for a cool mil, the producers have turned out a delightful movie.''But, a lot of the credit goes to the charismatic young lead star, Norman Reedus (Boondock Saints fame).''Actually, there are three stars in this production - shot mostly on location in Russia - Reedus, the cinematographer, and a Circus Bear.
The scenes are breathtaking; each frame, artfully painted with a lush palette - at times rich - but gritty, down 'n dirty, when needed to be.''There was a lot of thoughtful attention to visual detail which impressed me thoroughly, as well, in spite of the fact I am a tough critic!''And, the set-ups were outstanding; no pedestrian shots here. In fact, I was constantly amazed at their variety, as scenes flowed from one to the next.''Solimine has a keen eye, is quite talented, and shows a lot of potential ripe with possibilities.''
Also, Norman Reedus gives a stand-out performance...tough, yet vulnerable...his characterization resonates in every fibre of his being. He's a captivating screen presence, waiting to bust out. This kid is going places!''
The idea for ""Moscow Chill"" is charming and believable, too.''An altruistic computer whiz uncovers the tale of Prometheus - a Titan known for his wily intelligence, who stole fire from Zeus - and gave it to mortals for their use.''On the heels of this history lesson, the young lad decides to become a modern-day version of the Ancient Greek - along the lines of Robin Hood - with the ultimate aim of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor.''In a side-splitting scene, we first encounter the naive lad manipulating keys on a computer in the back of a taxi, which - in turn - causes scads of bills to fly out this way 'n that...from local ATM machines around the city...much to the delight of startled passers-by.''Unfortunately, the Reedus character gets caught. However, his unique skills do not escape the attention of a master criminal overseas, who hatches a plot to rescue the fresh felon, with the express intention of corralling his hacking skills.''In a nutshell, it's an embezzlement scam on a grand scale.''
But, there is a lot of mayhem along the way; and, it's spiked with a nasty shoot up or two here and there, a dash of of-the-wall humor, and an ironic twist or two, when least expected.''Nothing earth-shattering, or original. But, ""Moscow Chill"" does have a heart, even if it beats to a different drummer.'",1237593600,15,2499,4.91016548463357

3745408,5,B001PA0FHC,"I was very impressed by this movie.  I recognized Norman Reedus from Boondock Saints, so figured that there had to be something to this.  Kseniya Buravskaya, as Xusha Buravsky in this film, is stunning; I thought I recognized her from other movies, but looked her up on IMDB and found that I didn't recognize her body of work.  Maybe I'll go looking for it, as she was quite accomplished.  I wasn't disappointed at all by this film.  There are better movies out there, no question.  But this was solid, had a good story, good acting, good directing, good all around.  It's worth a watch, and definitely better than the 5.3 average rating that it had when I saw it.",1462406400,,664,4.529411764705882

3745425,5,B001PA0FHC,"This is a really good, diamond-in-the-rough film. It doesn't have the spit & polish of a Hollywood movie, and that definitely adds to it's charm if you go in knowing this ahead of time. They did a great job highlighting Russia herself; locale certainly sets the tone considerably. The editting was a bit jerky but not to distraction. The plot is thrown at you rather haphazardly but it's not complicated so you aren't left confused. It's not a deep, intense thriller where you have to hang on every detail but there's enough going on to keep you interested.

Norman Reedus did a fantastic and convincing job as the roll-with-the-punches American and I was impressed by the rest of the almost all Russian cast as well, especially Slava Schoot (Dolphin). Definitely worth a watch.",1456012800,4,778,4.849624060150376

Except for Norman, I don't think anyone could actually act. I will admit that the stilted dialog and the way it was filmed...all over the place...I did lose interest. I'm not sure if I will try again as I have with other movies.",1398729600,,394,4.197368421052632

3745472,4,B001PA0FHC,Loved it as an action movie lots of Norman reedus love scenes very sad in some parts loved the ending,1389571200,,101,4.1
3745473,4,B001PA0FHC,"The first 30 minutes or so are very engrossing, but the plot of MOSCOW CHILL often comes near derailment in the next two-thirds. All the same, it ties up very nicely in the end. Some violence, of course, but it wastes no time on prolonged shoot-'em-ups and punch-'em-outs. Great soundtrack and use of scenery. Norman Reedus is quite convincing as genius Robin Hood computer hacker Ray Perso--his whole demeanor is kind of Zuckerbergish, which is fitting. Kseniya Buravskaya gives a particularly splendid performance as Maya, with whom Ray finds true love. Much of the supporting cast--particularly the actor who plays Maya's father--are also worthy-of-mention and do a great deal to carry this unusual film.

MOSCOW CHILL may not have the kick that thriller fans want. It also lacks the layers of intrigue that many others expect. However, it has a flavor that's just all its own. This film has real heart with steady, believable humor, which make its lesser qualities forgivable. Though it has neither the scope nor the plot development of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Killer-Elite/dp/B006TLFIAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Killer Elite</a>, the conflict of how Perso wants out but finds it hard to simply walk out of the game reminded me a bit of that film.",1387411200,3,1304,5.487562189054726
3745474,5,B001PA0FHC,One of my favorite Norman Reedus films!  The way the criminal-minded characters work the Russian underworld while forming a family bond is interesting.  And Russia is a beautiful/brutal character all on her own.,1378166400,2,211,5.363636363636363

One of my favorite movies.",1365552000,4,115,4.523809523809524
3745476,1,B001PA0FHC,"The positive reviews appear to be too kind. I don't know, I couldn't watch past 8 minutes. The picture was grainy, the storyline was fragmented and forced, and there was no lure. If you watch this movie, start it with low-budget in mind.",1340150400,2,237,4.534883720930233
3745477,2,B001PA0FHC,Rented on published reviews. Should have known better. Was really looking forward to scenes of Moscow BUT not enough Moscow and script??? If it had been editted some maybe. Started and stopped several times. Acting 90& ok. Not enough action for men only. Not enough computer hacking to appeal to geeks. Not enough romance to appeal to women. ???? Don't bother with this one. Not recommended.,1337126400,2,391,4.9393939393939394
3745478,5,B001PA0FHC,"The only actor I'm familiar with in this movie is Norman Reedus. He plays an offbeat American computer genius/hacker who is jailed for his antics but escapes/is rescued with the help of a Russian mob and taken to Moscow for reasons unknown to him at first. My loyalty to each character kept changing, so it has its suspense.  I felt the Russian music was a little too loud and played a bit little too much for a film - Aside from the drama, adventure and action there is of course a love story which wasn't overdone. Overall, for what looked like an independent or low-budget film, you'll find pretty good cinematography as well as acting. I've never been to Russia;t you get many glimpses at different areas which seem as varied in extremes as in many places here in the U.S, from inner city monochromatic look to the beautiful surrounding countryside that appears untouched by the city's cold architecture amok with post=CW undergroun, even though it IS.",1317686400,,956,4.724550898203593
3745479,4,B001PA0FHC,"My husband sometimes picks some really loosers to watch, so when I saw that he had rented Moscow Chill, and I didn't recognize any of the names of the actors, I rolled my eyes.  Once the movie started, I was a bit skeptical, but before I knew it, I was caught up in the story.  The acting is good and since I didn't know any of them from previous movies, I didn't have any expectations and was never sure who was good, bad, or going to get killed!  Also, the music was great!  The movie scenes in Moscow and Russia were beautiful.  All and all, I recommend the movie - it has a good plot, likeable characters, and is very enjoyable.",1243814400,20,632,4.190082644628099

8332807,1,B001PA0FHC,"I watched up to the point where the jail psychologist asks Norman Reedus's superhacker whether the glass between them with some water in it is half-full or half-empty.

The plot could have used some straightening out -like why does the ""hero"" not want the money? After all, the guys American, so why doesn't he want the money? All in all the movie is better than expected, plus I never give a movie 3 stars, that's like saying you don't know the answer or can't make up your mind.
