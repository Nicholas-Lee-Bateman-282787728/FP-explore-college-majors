2390443,3,B000AQKV1M,"Avalanches are some bad business - and they're bad for business, particularly if you are building a luxurious hotel at the base of a high mountain threatening to slide off its shelf and come crashing down on top of you.  It's a subject that lends itself well to cinematic treatment, and I think this particular effort, Nature Unleashed: Avalanche, really isn't that bad of a film, especially given the project's budget.  The acting isn't all that bad for the most part, and the storyline and subplots are average yet solid.  It's not a film I would go out of my way to see, but there are certainly worse ways to spend an hour and a half.  And I'm happy to say that this whole disaster goes down without the words ""global warming"" being mentioned at all.

You can't blame nature completely for this disaster because it is helped along significantly by stupid people being stupid.  On the other hand, the catastrophe was inevitable given the geological conditions of the snow peaks in the area.  One woman knows just how real the danger is (and just how hard it is to survive an avalanche), but no one wants to listen to her - not the mayor of the town at the mountain base and certainly not the men putting the finishing touches on a brand new luxurious resort running up fast against a deadline for completion.  Even after a series of powerful and damaging avalanches take place, the scientist's warning of a super-avalanche fall on deaf ears for the most part.

Of course, you have to have at least one clich&eacute;d love story in play, but at least that is complemented by another subplot involving the builder of the hotel and his daughter.  One positive aspect of the film is its relative success at maintaining a strong degree of tension up until the very end.  There are a series of increasingly dangerous avalanches building up to the proverbial Big One, and massive mounds of soft snow aren't the safest places to conduct rescue missions, either.  I can't say the whole story isn't wholly predictable because it is, but the end result is still a decent movie.",1255392000,,2068,4.635616438356164

2390445,2,B000AQKV1M,"When I saw this DVD in the video store, I knew that I would rent it, as I have a thing for mountains, despite the feeling it would not be a very good movie. Well, my expectations were met. The movie, although mildly enjoyable at times for its mountain views, is pretty much a stinker. It is definitely not a keeper.

The plot is simple. Scientific data indicates that a particular mountain in the Urals in Eastern Europe is going to undergo a massive avalanche that will bring down about half the snow on the mountain onto a ski resort. Of course, the person who brings this information to the village's mayor is met with derision.  No one wants to believe her. Like John the Baptist, she is a voice crying alone in the wilderness.

Meanwhile, two mountain bad boys, brothers who run snowmobile tours in the mountains, have their own troubles. The younger one has had a bad break-up with the resort owner's daughter. The other one has his hands full keeping his wilder, younger brother in check. The resort owner's daughter has her own issues, as does her father and his business partner. When the inevitable happens and disaster strikes, let the games begin.

Over all, the special effects are repetitive, which is to be expected, given the fact that this is an obviously low budget film. The plot is loosey-goosey, with a number of silly sub-plots to nowhere, as the script is just plain bad. The directing is laughable and ham-handed. The acting is, for the most part, dreadful, with the exception of the resort owner, who gives evidence of some acting ability. No one in this film should give up their day job just yet.

The bottom line is that viewers should take a pass on this film, unless, like me, you are a sucker for mountains or disaster films. Even then, viewers should proceed at their own risk.",1143331200,6,1809,4.588235294117647
2390446,3,B000AQKV1M,"But it gets the job done.

A bunch of characters including two brothers, the younger brother's lover, her father the developer, and an avalanche watcher start to realize a nearby peak is about to come crashing down.  Trying to find a way to keep everyone safe while maintaining profit, all while overcoming their own inner drama and differences, keeps them busy for roughly an hour and a half.  We get to tag along too.

It basically has mediocre dialog, mediocre directing and editing, some pretty good photography, and bad acting, but it's the story that keeps this little experience interesting.  In general, it's a somewhat tense countdown while the weight of the mountain starts burdening the souls of all involved.  Can't say it was that bad.

Obviously a big difficulty was keeping it going with limited materials, being that a few shots/ideas are re-used several times.  It also has a pretty useless side-story about the developer's evil business partner that frankly only worked to use up space, then climaxed in a pretty campy shot that I won't give away.  But the fact that it even had side-plots and backstory and character development is kind of commendable for the type of movie it was.  So there we go.  Entertainment fun-fest and all that.

2390447,3,B000AQKV1M,"Another NATURE UNLEASHED disaster movie, and it's not bad, considering its low budget and direct to DVD lineage.  Ever since JAWS, disaster movies have the same formula:  an impending disaster, officials not wanting to lose their tourist business and subsequent doom prevails.  The effects are passable, and the dramatic narrative predictable, but even with that, fans of disaster films will probably enjoy the outcome.",1137888000,,419,5.515625
2390448,1,B000AQKV1M,"I was going to offset the previously bad review but I realized I just couldn't do that.  I barely made it through the bad acting, bad special effects and horrible script.  I will almost always see a movie again after a year or so but this one goes on my S list.",1134172800,,261,4.0
2390449,1,B000AQKV1M,"The real disaster is that this movie was ever released. The premise was not credible, the characters two-dimensional, the plot predictable, the dialog childish, and the avalanche scenes repetitive.

Waste of time.",1129766400,3,213,5.65625
8079073,5,B000AQKV1M,great movie with lots of action. I bought it because I am a Adam Croasdell fan. He and Andrew did a great job.,1427328000,,110,3.8260869565217392
8079074,1,B000AQKV1M,"Seriously,  this movie cost $2.5 million dollars to make?! How? There aren't any recognizable actors in it and they certainly didn't spend the money on special effects.  A trip to Bulgaria (where they filmed the movie incidentally)  had to be the only real expense. However,  I am giving it a solid 1 star: half a star goes to a cool music track when the credits are rolling, and half a star for allowing me a good 20-30 minute nap. Ok you got me, I did sleep through part of the movie so how can I justify reviewing it or only giving it 1 star? I guess it's possible that during my nap I did miss out on some cinematic magic, but I'm gonna say probably not.

OK, so if you need a quick synopsis of the ""storyline"" (LOL, like there really was one!), here it is: some jackazz falls off his snowmobile and it causes a mini-avalanche.  Then an avalanche expert - as if this were really a thing -  hires a couple of dumbazzes to take her up on the mountain to check things out.  Most of her expertise apparently involves eating snow and pressing her ear against it. Brilliant! Did she get a PhD in that? Did defending her doctoral thesis also consist of eating snow in front of a panel of experts? Probably! Anywho..turns out, there's a super avalanche headed towards a brand new swanky hotel.  Naturally the rat bastard resort owner and his Russian mafia pal don't want the place evacuated because it will ruin the grand opening.  He finally wises up when his daughter gets snowed in and he asks for the help of the avalanche ""expert"" and some other equally inept and forgettable types to rescue her. Queue music for happy ending, and roll credits.

Recommended ONLY if you are into awful movies and need a good nap.",1419292800,,1713,4.423566878980892

8079077,5,B000AQKV1M,This is a typical SciFi disaster film. For those who like to watch mother nature wreak some havoc this is one of many to watch.  At least in this one more people listen to the warnings.,1383264000,,185,4.138888888888889
8079078,3,B000AQKV1M,"I've seen a number of these productions. Some are without an adequate number of redeeming features to warrant even one viewing. Despite stilted dialogue, routine plotting, and a general awkwardness in performance, I found this one to be of sufficient interest to make a pleasant second feature in an evening's program of DVD movies. This may be because I so rarely see any skiing, and, certainly,  haven't seen a snow-filled picture in years,  I did not mind the readily apparent blemishes. At any rate, seen with Midnight at about dead center in the viewing, I found it acceptable readying for sleep fare. If you do not like the idea that you might be wasting your time, I would recommend giving it a viewing. Whether or not it is worth the price of buying it as a single (it is in some cheap multi-film collections) is an individual matter; I don't think I would advise the purchase under those circumstances.",1373414400,,911,4.723270440251572
8079079,3,B000AQKV1M,If you like Andrew Lee Potts watch this. He is young and speaks in a American accent in it. Yes I would recommend it.,1371168000,,117,3.9166666666666665
8079080,2,B000AQKV1M,"Boring. Predictable. Acting is below average at best. The giant avalanche actually looked computer generated to me, as did the less threatening breaking of the snow. Typical storyline in that one person warns of a super avalanche pending, but others don't believe it for various reasons.",1319587200,,287,5.260869565217392
8079081,4,B000AQKV1M,"This movie would've failed without Andrew Lee Potts.
Low budget, not so great acting (besides Andrew), not even a very great storyline.
That said, the two brother's relationship was portrayed quite well. Once, the two started arguing and pushing each other, then they started laughing. Very realistic, since the argument was pretty pathetic.

So unless you are crazy about Andrew or really love diasaster films, don't buy this. Rent it from the library and save your money.",1299715200,2,473,5.142857142857143

There were also some dead spots where the movie just did not move or were boring but for the most part you could watch it.
