6797716,1,B00PCN9S2G,This is the worst exercise dvd I have ever seen.  There is no way to navigate your way around the disks and so you have to start all over again when you want to just do the exerises and not have to listen to some guy talking about what he is going to do and how he is going to do it.  That's fine for the first time but it really gets tedious any time after that.,1419206400,10,363,3.7012987012987013
8687410,1,B00PCN9S2G,Totally not what I was expecting.  Way too slow and underwhelming for waht I want.  Had no chance to preview and now want my money back.,1477267200,,136,4.1923076923076925
8687411,5,B00PCN9S2G,Great,1459036800,,5,5.0
8687412,2,B00PCN9S2G,Boring and pretty lame. This is a workout for someone who can barely move,1454716800,,73,4.285714285714286
8687413,1,B00PCN9S2G,The software wiuld not allow me to rate this a zero. This video is a complete let down.  There are no continuous exercises just instruction.  You advertise it with a woman and there are no women in the video.  Zero I wish I had not bought this video.  Misleading advertisement! !!!!,1454630400,,282,4.470588235294118

8687415,5,B00PCN9S2G,My mom is 70 and really liked this workout. She has a bad back and has a hard time. Although she couldn't do the full workout she was able to do some of it. Something is better than nothing. She really recommends this video.,1437868800,,224,4.113636363636363
8687416,5,B00PCN9S2G,"Very nice workout - There is a section for beginners, intermediate and advanced.  I truly enjoy doing these workouts.",1427760000,,117,5.157894736842105
8687417,2,B00PCN9S2G,"Jon Spurlings DVD  has a woman exercising on the front.  But it is Jon with another guy showing you the exercises.  He demonstrates each exercise with a 2 minute brake between the next. Also on the 2nd DVD he uses and exercise ball ,and on the 3rd he use a exercise band. This should be shown on the front of the DVD that way you would know they are included some where in the routine. I thought since their is a woman on the front it would be a woman demonstrating.",1424217600,6,466,4.0989010989010985
8687418,3,B00PCN9S2G,"Good exercises, but the constant 2 minute breaks are not necessary.",1421712000,2,67,5.181818181818182
8687419,4,B00PCN9S2G,"Firstly, I've got this excellent DVD set as a b-day gift. I'm 50+ and I usually exercise at home. As I've never used a workout video before, it was amazing for me to find out how easy is exercising while watching workout video tips and instructions. These videos really helped me to increase my energy level. So I decided to buy this DVD set as a gift also for my friend! The only reason for giving it 4 stars is because I don't like 2 min waiting time between exercises (time consuming).",1420329600,3,488,4.315217391304348
