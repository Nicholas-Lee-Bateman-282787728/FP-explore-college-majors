8125127,5,B000FOU9GG,"This is the most charismatic film I have ever seen.  It is a miracle of film making achievement.
It is sort of like the film ""8 mile"" featuring Eminem, except this time the protagonist and background characters are decent people.",1382313600,2,229,4.725
8125128,1,B000FOU9GG,"I got a very bad copy, it skipped through my favorite parts. This is the second copy I bought. I want a original movie, that's what I thought I ordered.",1339545600,,152,4.1
8125129,5,B000FOU9GG,"Dilema:  I cannot decide whether Disco Dancer is one of the worst movies ever made or one of the best. Not that it matters. It's entertaining both ways. I live I Los Angeles and I'm not Indian, so culturally, something is always lost on me. I admire the Indian fan base because, from what I've read, and from the  Indians with whom  I've met and discussed Hindu cinema, they are so sincere and passionate about how wonderful these movies are. I'm always charmed and reluctant to be a dismissive smart-ass . But Disco Dancer is really silly, though always delightful.  The preposterous story points compile on each other point after point until I found myself turning my head and looking around the room wondering: where's Fellini?
In a film entitled Disco Dancer, it seems that no one can really dance. The dancers look more like the contestants midway through a season of Dancing With the Stars. They give it their all but aren't quite yet there.  It reminds me of many pictures made in the States during the 70's and 80's. B-movies. Low budget. Something surreal about the story lines.  That said, Disco Dancer is really funny. The dance numbers are sometimes so delightfully bad, I find myself embarrassed when showing others.  But you gotta see this one. I've never been one for disco but a couple tunes had me tapping the toes.  Be sure to watch the final sequence all the way through. At the very start of the International disco competition, they announced the King & Queen of Africa Disco and apparently, casting found the only two Africans in India who can't dance and look terrified to be on camera. But as if that weren't enough, the next couple is the King and queen of Paris Disco. Cut to an impossibly skinny guy who stumbles and a young woman in jeans and a red shirt who dances like she just had an enormous pancake breakfast. And they're the king and queen?  Also, look for the female lead dancing a number Jimmy Jimmy Adja Adja.  A slight continuity problem with her shoes. Now you see them, now you don't.
Don't miss Disco Dancer. Grab some Indian food, have some friends over and make a night of it.",1310342400,2,2119,4.582010582010582

The movie has a decent story but good music by Bappi Lahiri",1299628800,,143,4.107142857142857

8125132,1,B000FOU9GG,"I'm a ballroom dancer and do a little disco dancing (called the Hustle), so I was drawn to this movie by its title.  Apparently the other reviewers are not dancers.  This is the worst dancing film I've ever seen.  This was worse than watching my parents dance.  The sound quality is bad.  The lip synching and dubbing are hilarious, but in a bad way.  I watched the whole movie like I was watching a train wreck...I didn't want to look, but the visions on the screen were too terrible to turn away.  One of the dance moves he does is to roll back and forth on the floor for 30 seconds.  The dance scenes never seem to end.  The plot was okay, but having to sit through bad dancing by someone with no style or rythym was horrendous.",1190678400,,731,4.239130434782608
8125133,5,B000FOU9GG,"This film is incredible! Great music, fabulous dance sequences, sometimes silly plot wrinkles that, taken together, make one of the most singularly entertaining motion picture experiences ever. Nothing deep, but you will never forget some of the key scenes, and the songs are brilliant! Sri Lankan rapper M.I.A. has recently covered one of the tunes (""Jimmy"") showing the wide appeal of this classic film. Watch it with your friends. Oh, did I mention the fight sequences? Wow!",1190246400,4,477,5.207792207792208
8125134,5,B000FOU9GG,"OK,FIRST OF ALL HAVING SUCH A LEGEND LIKE MITHUN IS A PLUS POINT BUT THE BONUS IS THAT ITS A GREAT FILM. NO WONDER THE FILM WAS A SUPER HIT.

  MTIHUN CHAKRABORTY IS FANTASTIC IN HERE. HIS DANCES ARE JUST SUPERB!

  ALL THE INDIANS OUT THERE BUY THIS MASTERPEICE OF A FILM.",1172966400,2,273,4.153846153846154
