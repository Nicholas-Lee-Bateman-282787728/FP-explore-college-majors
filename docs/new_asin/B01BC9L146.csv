It's not ""approved"" so expected repackaging and narration but expected it would move beyond the early years. That was the main reason I bought this one.  I thought great, it will include more recent albums and tours.  Nope!  Not only, but also -- this is the EXACT SAME DVD's as ""The Calm Before the Storm Under Review 1969-1971"" here in this package entitled ""Floating in a Tin Can: The Missing Years 1968-1972""  (Do not even ask me how those are ""missing years"" as that seems to be all anyone focuses on.  The ""missing years"" are beyond Serious Moonlight.)  The second DVD in this package entitled ""A Decadent Desolation: David Bowie 1976-1979' is the EXACT SAME video as one being sold as ""Bowie in Berlin: Ein Dokumentarilm 1976-1979.""  Yup, they used German on the cover.  HA!  Anyway the DVD's are narrated with lots of still pictures and interviews with people that do have some insight into the scene but certainly not main players.  Those people would never agree to do an interview for something as non-sanctioned as this.  So I foolish bought some duplicates.  Silly me.  It's irritating they are doing this. It doesn't feel fair.  Beyond that, if you find it used and cheap, maybe --but it's really not worth it.  Nothing you don't know if your a fan.  Certainly be careful not to buy duplicate videos.  I have a feeling this is going to keep happening for a time as people try to ""make a buck"" off Bowie.  Save your money and buy a good biography or concert video that IS sanctioned.",1466294400,10,1618,4.614035087719298

I wouldn't say it's false advertising but it's pretty close to it. My own damn fault, I guess. Teaches me to not buy something without reading the content description...

If you don't have the stuff from 68 thru 79 then I guess this would be an OK thing to buy, hence my rating.",1462665600,16,576,4.324074074074074

By

David Bowie: The Final Changes DVD set is a fine double dose of the Diamond Dogs Duke tracing the early years and then the immense achievement of a period settled in Europe. Read on.

A Decadent Desolation: David Bowie 1976-1979 is an 85 minute DVD that assesses the period surrounding the most critically acclaimed years of the deceased rock deity. 1969 kick started the Bowie buoyancy as he transformed himself from just another folk pop artist in to a Space Oddity sensation. From that elevation it was onwards through other phases heading towards the monumental Ziggy Stardust and then soul boy come Thin White Duke era.  The creativity was evident as David Bowie morphed from 60s wannabe to 70s wonder!
A lead part as an alien in the Man who fell to Earth movie had the man born David Robert Jones shift gears. This androgynous idol was also drawn towards the aural adventure apparent in Germany-and, many different facets of the krautrock scene that awkwardly collated a diverse array of artists e.g. Kraftwerk, Neu, Harmonia, Cluster, Faust and Tangerine Dream.
In disarray through excessive narcotics and in a rut Bowie packed his bags and Iggy Pop joined him for what was to prove to be a successful stint in Berlin. These pop pioneers sought to clean up their acts while taking their respective careers in new directions. It certainly worked for Iggy who with the assistance of David made some of his most memorable music.
The year 1977 when there was the punk explosion saw Bowie fighting back with his finest of industry. David release Low (January 1) and Heroes (October 14)-and, there was Iggy involvement. Meanwhile, Iggy Pop with an immense Bowie input released The Idiot (March 18) and Lust for Life (August 29). These friends also toured the globe as a and Iggy Pop led five-piece that also included: Ricky Gardiner as well as Tony and Hunt Sales
Therefore, as well as playing central roles in the brace of Pop albums the Bowie enterprise was phenomenal during a annum. Within 12 months David was at the core of a quartet of the most influential modern musical masterpieces; plus, there was the addition of a memorable world excursion playing live (check out the CD: Iggy Pop with David Bowie Mantra Studios Broadcast 1977)! If work was to free Bowie and Iggy from the downside of dependency and the failings of fame then their escape route was a punishing schedule-and, ultimately the creation of sonorous substance of sublime standards.
This was just one chunk of a glorious period that also brought the public the underrated Lodger in 1979. As the Sister Midnight tune recorded with Iggy kicked off the golden years in Berlin-ironically it was later re-recorded backwards with new lyrics in the form of Red Money (the final track on Davids 1979 Lodger)-and it was this recording that closed this residence in the German city.
The magpie mechanics of the Brixton boy was to score fresh praise-and, personnel such as Tony Visconti, Brian Eno and Robert Fripp played roles in another new and exciting Bowie chapter. Other peripheral characters may not have been directly associated with the end product but their style certainly iced the goods and producer Connie Plank is one such person who cannot be excluded from the story.
An era of electro experimentation blended with an already pertinent ability to create a  premier pop/rebel rock mix enabled alternative album aplomb to flourish across the years 1976-1979. As a result the remarkable records: Low, Heroes and Lodger surfaced and in turn stamped their phenomenal fare upon the musical world.
Associates, analysts, affecters and admirers unveil the details surrounding these renowned studio triumphs-and, once again the brilliance of Bowie comes to the fore.
As 2016 opened the life of Bowie ended-and, the Starman is sorely missed!

The David Bowie: Floating in a Tin Can The Missing Years 1968-1972 DVD mostly discusses the pre-Ziggy Stardust era of an artist attempting to create a niche in the pop market. The Bowie leanings towards Anthony Newley had ran out of steam as did the Donovan/Dylan folksy templates. The soon to be Starman had tried to break in to the mainstream and made strides at gaining attention via: The pop market in his Davy Jones and Bowie guises, he had also performed mime, acted in adverts and made a
television appearance calling for the support of long hair!
This documentary has many interesting facts to reveal and its depiction of the young Bowie is memorable. His friendship with Marc Bolan and the pivotal link up with producer Tony Visconti are integral to the plot.
Bowie needed just one identity as a new decade was about to break (even though he was set to develop many different personas later in his career). The monster hit Space Oddity was the vehicle to move Bowie in to the public consciousness and from that point this young talent was to make huge leaps in terms of both his studio and stage work. This album showed that there was a budding talent underneath the radar and from this juncture Bowie leapt forward in many directions.
A run of ground-breaking records ensued and in particular albums such as The Man who sold the World plus Hunky Dory displayed both diversity and dexterity that had not been evident in this performer only a handful of years previously.
Collaborators and a collection of rock journalists unite to outline how Bowie even at a less salubrious stage of his career had a belief and determination that would eventually carry him from relative obscurity to global fame. A young Bowie tried a number of caricatures before 1969 and his illustrious hit single witnessed a major increase in his fortunes. From that juncture a series of Changes in his music and make-up created the ultimate rock chameleon that could never be pigeon-holed.",1460246400,7,5859,4.900201612903226
