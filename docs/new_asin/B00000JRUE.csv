Tricep Tendon Armbars & Armlocks

By Wally Jay

 This is the fourth of a five volume instructional series of videos by Wally Jay on Small Circle Jujitsu.  This volume begins with Wally Jay demonstrating an exercise of ""snaking"" his thumb and wrist of both hands around each forarm which he says is necessary to develop sensitivity to be able to make transitions from one Jujitsu technique to another.

 For nearly the next 20 minutes, Wally Jay demonstrates variations of applying pressure on the tricep tendon golgi receptor nerve as a pressure point which is about one inch above the elbow as a means of increasing pain in the use of jujitsu techniques such as armbars, escape and release from chokes and holds.

 Two of Wally Jay's students demonstrate a drill of a series of techniques that I think is designed for the purpose of teaching students how to flow smoothly from one jujitsu technique into an entry for another jujitsu technique as a grappling situation changes in a struggle with the opponent or simply to switch techniques if one fails to work.  Thus, adapting to situation of the moment is the idea in this focus upon transitioning drills.

 Some ground work is demonstrated.  Then, the topic goes back to armbars, arm locks, shoulder locks and a few throws.

 There are many good techniques and concepts which are useful for jujitsu students of any level from beginner to blackbelt in this volume and the other volumes of this series of Wally Jay's Small Circle Jujitsu.  Wally Jay's instruction is easy to follow and very effective as self defense.

 What is missing from Wally Jay's book and series of videos on Small Circle Jujitsu is self defense against opponents armed with weapons and self defense against multiple opponents.

 These videos complement Wally Jay's book of Small Circle Jujitsu very well.  If you are serious about jujitsu as self defense, you will not be sorry after buying his book and the entire series of 5 volumes of videos on Small Circle Jujitsu.  I have had them for a few years and I never get tired or bored of reading his book nor of watching his videos again and again.  There is a lot of good information in them worth buying.

 The videos are available in VHS tape or DVD formats.  As I already indicated above, there is book by Wally Jay with the same title which can be used with the videos very well.

 You can find the book and all the video volumes in DVD or VHS on Amazon.com by entering ""Small Circle Jujitsu"" in quotes in the search box or go to [...] and find them there.

 I hope that this review has been helpful to you.",1103587200,,2618,4.616052060737527
