8606634,3,B00ELE8D2I,"W-e-l-l, I expected way too much from this. I thought a Victorian period piece set in a women's prison sounded like an off-the-beaten path type of movie that was sure to have some interesting twists and turns. The elements were there for a good story, but it landed really flat. The main character was just too morose. The sets were really dark, and well, everything was dark. By the time the big reveal happened in the last minutes, I didn't care. It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but I don't think I will be watching it again for the next 5 years.",1432252800,,558,4.375

8606637,4,B00ELE8D2I,"One is weak in heart, lonely, a prisoner in her own home and way of life. She's a prime example of how one could have every materialistic possession, money, and title, and yet still be miserable and alone. Desperate.

She's the perfect prey and easily duped by a young prisoner, another woman, whose prison is an actual cell and perhaps, her own depravity.

I guess the prisoner's character is strong...stronger than the lady's anyway. But she too is weak to things, matters of the flesh, the heart, and overly desirous of what the lady has. Yes, material items can weaken us.

That being said, I'd like to talk about the good things in this movie: It's entertaining, suspenseful, has terrific costumes and settings (Victorian England), and shows us how very rough life in a women's prison was back in these times: their cells, their bathing process, their hair being shorn, their items being stored in drawers and riffled through by whomever wishes to, the dark rooms used for discipline.

There's a supposed spiritual theme too, as the prisoner claims that spirits speak through her. As a matter of fact, a spirit named Peter Quick is, of course!, the actual murderer...not her. *winks*

The acting was superb, as I found myself duped as well. Didn't see the results coming. Not at all.

The cons: The movie was very dark, and I don't mean in nature (which it is) but the lighting. I get London is a rather dark and foggy place at times, but everyday? The prison I expected to be dark, but the rest of it, it seemed they dimmed everything.

My last quibble...as the closing credits rolled by I found myself scratching my head and asking, ""So, was Peter Quick fake? Who was that face then? Is she a spiritualist? What the hell?""

I hate being left with questions.

BUT, for those who love a suspenseful period drama, this is a great flick to get your hands on. Note: there is some very mild lesbianism--nothing but kisses.",1406678400,5,1923,4.665680473372781
8606638,1,B00ELE8D2I,"There was a lot missing with this movie, I thought that the movie left you hanging.  The characters were pathetic  and not interesting.  The last half hour of the movie was on fast forward.  The only thing that they did well was the costumes and sets.",1405728000,,251,4.391304347826087
