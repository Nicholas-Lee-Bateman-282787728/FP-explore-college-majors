4484875,4,B004VWKD82,"This was an interesting documentary that followed the families, medical staff and people affected with contaminated blood from transfusions. What makes this film so alarming is how an outbreak of HIV, AIDS and hepatitis could spread in the medical industry. Despite the high risk of contamination when producing blood derived treatments many donor and drug companies neglected to screen stock. (Which in this particular documentary affected thousands of hemophilia patients). Even worse is the lack of concern/ delayed warning from government, medical agencies and staff to the public that stock was discovered to be contaminated. Common sense will tell you to first test your blood donors and continuously test your stock in order to first prevent to the outbreak and spread of blood transferable diseases. Second, if contamination is discovered, common sense would tell you to immediately inform the public, recall stock and advise against further use (instead of stating that youll wait for further testing, that until then its still ok to use stock; or recall it and continue to use this same contaminated stock in other countries).
This film just goes to show once again that corporations are out for your money and profit! This is an interesting watch and I would recommend to others.",1386028800,,1290,5.236714975845411

4484880,4,B004VWKD82,A very good documentary for people considering using any blood product...whether a transfusion or blood by-products.  You may never know what you were accidentally exposed to until it's too late...even years later.,1376956800,,214,5.6875
4484881,5,B004VWKD82,"Back in Feburary 1984 I was in a near fatal auto accident. It was the height of AIDS without a blood test available to screen contaminated blood. Due to the injuries/complications which required arterial blood gas tests every 2hrs, and even surgeries, I lost a lot of blood. It was sheer torture to go from weeks being bedridden to a tilt-table to ""stand"" upright (a feat I couldn't do on my own, just would pass out), as there wasn't enough red blood cells to oxygenate the blood. After a surgery to nail the femur, the doctors had to make a choice: give blood or have complications and die. They knew the blood could've been my death sentence, if the complications didn't kill me first. But I could tell it was urgent, having lost even more blood ripping IVs out fainting again. So deathly tired (never in my life was so tired), I agreed. Didn't want to die there in an orthopedic cage (""Fourth of July"" military hospital system anyone?).

I got 2 bags of whole blood. Dodged the HIV/AIDs lethal bullet. Missed getting hepatitis, too.

Thousands of Hemophiliacs didn't. They contracted the other blood borne illnesses too, like Hepatitis. Their treatment to give them a life had either a death sentence or a life of debilitating complication warning on it. They were ""shot"" indefinitely, too.

Over 10,000 of them died.

It wasn't ""good medicine"", because what killed them was profits. If you go to a contagious vector and draw human serum/blood; then pay folks who were druggies and worse for their next fix even (why tell the truth if they can get free money for the next rock?); the result is all hemophiliacs who used ""Factor"" were in danger, every one (and all those using blood products).

Medicine isn't about profits. It's about humans being humane to others. It's about restoring life to others in need. Profits are counter to why medicine has been more the noble art of heroes, than Wall Street dividends.

We have come a long way from then, but we can't have dying teenagers making life or death decisions due to greenbacks. It's more than unethical, that's criminal.",1376870400,4,2080,4.732044198895028
4484882,4,B004VWKD82,Had to get this as an assignment for a class I took college. Very informative and very interesting but don't watch it late at night when you are tired and its the end of the week. I would recommend watching this for information about how our gov. works the medical society.,1322956800,2,273,4.372549019607843
4484883,5,B004VWKD82,"This was overall an excellent documentary that I would highly recommend to everyone.  But be warned, there were a few overly dramatic segments.

There was absolutely NO excuse for what the drug companies did to the hemophiliac population knowing what they did in fact know at the time.  And for that, I will never defend them for their role this tragedy.

However, I do think the film left out some critical historical information.  While the history of HIV in the hemophilia community is a compelling story that needs to be told, to me, a documentary should be more objective than this film comes off (Don't get me wrong, I am on her side of the fence from my own subjective standpoint).  After watching this, you will walk away hating the medical industry and feeling hopeless about healthcare -- you know, as if in today's day and age you don't already -- and you shouldn't.

Although Bad Blood is excellent and highly watchable, this film is not the complete history and it doesnt give the whole story.  It also leaves out some of the more notorious events and people who played a role in the ""decisionmaking.""  I know, it is hard to fit everything into an acceptable time frame for a film, but other viewers should be aware of that as well.

For the above reasons, as a supplement to this film, I would recommend picking up the IOM's ""HIV and the Blood Supply,"" and the book ""Blood Saga"" by Susan Resnik to get a better balanced picture.",1314057600,9,1442,4.575875486381323
4484884,5,B004VWKD82,"I always thought I had a low opinion of my fellow human beings. But ""Bad blood"" showed me people are a thousand times worse than I expect them to be.

I caught this show on PBS and missed a few minutes at the beginning, so I thought this was a show about hemophilia. No. It was about how drug companies, government agencies and doctors murdered 10,000 hemophilia patients. Ten thousand Americans got AIDS from tainted blood and died. When the evidence that the blood supply in the country was tainted with HIV and hepatitis surfaced, the people who are supposed to protect patients decided to do nothing and wait for data. What data? Logic says if the drug companies are not screening blood sellers for diseases, and the production of hemophilia drugs requires mixing blood from a huge number of people, contamination is highly likely. Then when eventually the drug companies ""quietly"" recalled the tainted drugs, they were allowed to ship the recalled product to foreign countries. What is the thinking behind this? It's ok to kill foreigners? I am in total shock.

This documentary is a wake-up call to everyone who blindly thinks the government or your doctor would protect you. Think again. People are evil.",1308528000,14,1211,4.845410628019324

8444208,5,B004VWKD82,I was an infusion nurse before I retired and administered 100's of doses of factor years after the problems in this documentary occurred. I am appalled that the manufacturers of factor knew that their products were contaminated. I know that the tracking of each dose and lot numbers are very ridged now.

8444209,5,B004VWKD82,"i hate spoilers so i won't give details about what it's about, but in general - it was super informative about hemophiliacs and what they endure and how AIDS and hep affected them before blood was regulated. Very informative about the pharmaceutical industry and what they will do, if not regulated. Scary. I now have tremendous empathy for a small group of people I knew very little about and how they fought for major changes that ended up protecting us all in the long run. Very hard to believe that this all took place in the 80's, which does not seem very long ago. Great documentary - coming from a documentary fiend.",1520121600,,623,4.571428571428571

8444213,5,B004VWKD82,"This documentary was absolutely heartbreaking to watch. This event in history is the reason I never met my grandfather. He was a severe hemophiliac who contracted the Aids virus from tainted product and he died while my mother was pregnant with me. It is incredibly sad that over 10,000 hemophiliacs had to die and the remaining patients and families had to fight so hard to get anything done and in the end the big drug companies handed out a ""compassionate pay"" as to try to avoid admitting fault for what they had done.

I am so grateful that these people fought so hard so that my little hemophiliac would have a better life and hopefully never have to endure what they did.",1458086400,2,678,4.557377049180328
