8646199,5,B00IXQV6DS,"This DVD is a compilation of films that explore the nature of consciousness.  It is imaginative and deals with ideas that are on the fringes of conventional wisdom.  If you are the type of person who knows that there is more to life than what we are ordinarily presented by the corporate media, religious and political leaders, government and other authorities who have no awareness, you will appreciate the unconventional nature of this film.  The title piece explores themes of shadow government and the mind control that keeps us all enslaved.  It is loaded with references to the Hindu concept of Maya or illusion/delusion and the covert government experiments such as MK Ultra where LSD was used as a CIA weapon and mass delusion of the population was and is the zeitgeist of our times. It features all kinds of subliminal messages that support the theme of Power Elites experimenting on ordinary people with cognitive control mechanisms. And it culminates in a sequence that draws on the most arcane and bizarre aspects of Hindu mythology where in UFOs destroy the delusional reality that most of our sad humanity is afflicted by. The other films featured on the DVD are more abstract and visionary and deal with the nature of consciousness and perception.  All heads, stoners and free thinkers must own this DVD!  I guarantee you will have your mind blown. This DVD is weird and different.  It should be embraced by the anti-establishment and those who have the capacity for free thinking and imagination.",1408060800,,1512,4.929133858267717
