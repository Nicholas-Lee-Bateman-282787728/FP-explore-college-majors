6588904,5,B00MMPB64K,"My girls (ages 4 and 7) love Sofia the First and we have every episode on our DVR, including all of the episodes from this DVD. The show is great for its cute characters, wonderful songs and fun adventures. It always has a positive message and teaches kids valuable lessons in every episode. My girls have been obsessed with the movie and all the shows, and really look forward to each new episode that airs.

This DVD contains five great episodes. Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:

1. Holiday in Enchancia - King Roland can't get home in time for the Wassailia holidays.  Princess Aurora makes an appearance.
2. Baileywick's Day Off - Baileywick's brother Nigel is in town to celebrate Baileywick's Birthday.
3. The Little Witch - A lonely young witch named Lucinda is hexing the village children.
4. The Baker King - King Roland makes a wish for a simple life as a village baker.
5. Four's A Crowd - Sofia is jealous of Jade and Ruby's friendship with Amber.",1414627200,49,1049,4.5396825396825395

6588914,5,B00MMPB64K,"Sofia the First: Holiday in Enchancia is a 2014 Disney DVD compilation featuring five episodes of the popular Disney Junior animated series starring the littlest Disney Princess and an appearance by Princess Aurora(from Sleeping Beauty). In Holiday in Enchancia, Sofia and her Family celebrated Wassailia Day, a traditional European holiday. But when King Roland and Baileywick is lost during a winter storm, Sofia, Queen Miranda, and Amber and James must find them safely, and with the help of Princess Aurora and Sofia's animal friends, The Royal Family spends Wassailia Day with new friends. This DVD also features other episodes, like Baileywick gets a day off on his birthday and his brother, Nigel, visits. And Sofia helps a young witch named Lucinda be a good witch and stop playing pranks on the village children. The DVD special features only has sneak peeks of other Disney DVD favourites like a teaser trailer for Cinderella and a full trailer for DisneyNature's Monkey Kingdom. Sofia the First: Holiday in Enchancia is perfect for Holiday viewing.",1453420800,,1059,5.1988304093567255

6588917,1,B00MMPB64K,"I really hate to have to leave this rating, but here goes.  My girls love Sophia, but this one is headed to file thirteen.  I bought it while shopping for CHRISTMAS shows for the kids.  I would not have purchased it if I had realized that there is not a single reference to Christmas in the ""Holiday"" episode.  There is a tree with gifts, a celebration in winter time and lots of other holiday themes (even a miracle), but not a single reference to Christmas.  Instead, the characters refer to the celebration of Wasaillia Day.  My family and I are Christians, and Christmas is a religious holiday.  It is the celebration of the birth of our Lord Jesus.  Even the story of Saint Nicholas, the giving of gifts and the star on top of the tree have their roots in Christian religion.  Christmas is a time to celebrate the hope we have because Christ came to lift mankind by his gift.  This was a real let down and it left me thinking about all the things that are wrong in the world, and all the ugly things my children will have to face because our nation has abandoned God's great gift.  Wish Disney would choose some other religion to bully and mock.  Sad.",1450051200,4,1156,4.375586854460094

6588976,1,B00MMPB64K,"The most important idea - if Sofia is learning how to be unselfish and loyal and humble and all of these qualities that the show teaches, what's the point?  Secular humanism behavior should be true to its philosophy, brought to us by Nitsche. (spelling?)  Might makes right!  Trample on the opposition.  Taking away Christmas removes the point of selfless values - which this episode goes to unprecedented lengths to do; come on, it's a cartoon!  If we're going to have survival of the fittest motivations (Wassalia replacing Christmas) then lets trumpet survival of the fittest behavior as well.  Sofia the first has been a favorite at our house.  But the extreme lengths to maintain a secular humanist philosophy are revealed very clearly in this episode.  I realize that a European-styled princess might not celebrate the Baby in the manger (although, historically - a lot of the royalty at least said they were Christians) - but if you're going to have a fake made-up holiday ""Wassalia"" and never mention the word Christmas - but yet have a decorated tree, a special party, gifts, family and snow - you're just confusing children and we will no longer spend money on Sofia the First, nor recommend it.  Just Disney being Disney I guess.",1420761600,5,1240,4.866666666666666
