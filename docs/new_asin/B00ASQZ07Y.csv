I also like that inside the DVD case is a tool & supply guide to use if you want to make these projects. The only problem I had was for the first 2 leather project is how do you put them on?? What kind of knot do you use?? Is it a bow, or sliding knot or overhand?? Which is the best??",1392854400,,424,3.8295454545454546
8557399,5,B00ASQZ07Y,"Simple Necklaces for Beginning Jewelers by Connie Shaw is a perfect way to learn how to make necklaces and use the tools of the trade. The step-by-step directions Connie gives are clear and the pace is perfect for a beginner like me.
I bought all the Simple Jewelry Series. First I watched the Design Concepts, then the Simple Bracelets, next Simple Earrings, and finished with the Simple Necklaces. The series has gotten me off to a great start and  I'm now confident I can make some beautiful things!",1361318400,2,502,4.704545454545454
