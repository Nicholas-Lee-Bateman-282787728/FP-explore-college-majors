2475350,4,B000DZ95N0,"Just wanted to point out a couple things quick namely the first review by Dylangump which states he doesn't like the tachikoma voices?? They are the same voices as season 1, and why now of all times do you decide to complain about them halfway through season 2?? As for the anti Amercian pleeeeaaassse! What other countries aren't entitled to there opinion? Plus if you knew anything about the military you would know that the US Army wears there American Flag on the shoulder backwards because it is meant to symbolize how the flag looks when charging into combat! Anyway this is a great show, and fans of the series, or the ghost in the shell movies will enjoy!",1142294400,6,663,4.579831932773109
2475351,2,B000DZ95N0,"While I've been a big fan of Ghost In The Shell, these stories are the worst yet. (I've watched the first three episodes on Cartoon Network as the DVD is not out yet).

In ""Make Up"", the story is flawed in that Paz would have never been allowed to roam ""free"" while an exact copy cat of himself is on the lose killing people.

In ""Poker Face"" the ""Emperial"" America is such and Anti-American statement especially when the Amercian UN Forces have the American flag sewed on their uniforms backwards! This may have been an error but I doubt it.

In PAT. the tachikoma's voices are so annoying and so much information is thrown at you that it's hard to follow. Most if is a rehash on previous episodes. With their childest voices, they shouldn't be used as a main plot of the story.",1142121600,4,779,4.395833333333333
2475352,4,B000DZ95N0,"2nd Gig's opening has been relentless and bold, leaving us to wonder, ""so will any of these episodes truly 'Stand-alone' as they did last season?""  Well, the answer is ""not really"" but the motion is so good that it won't matter.

However, in these four episodes, we have our greatest change-of-pace away from the Individualist Eleven storyline, so enjoy what you get here.

My review is working off of fansubs, with the purpose of informing-- so some translations may differ from our ending results in the USA.

Episode 13: ""Face""/""Make-up""

After the shocking end of Episode 12 where folks were literally losing their heads, we are slammed back into the aftermath where we attempt to figure out ""What's up with that Kuze fellow?""  The trail leads us to a specialist cyborg facemaker who's been recently put out of business by none other than our own Section 9 muscle-- Paz.  Questions abound as we are given a window into this supporting cast member's life outside of work, and what consequences such a life renders.

Episode 14: ""Beware the Left Eye"" / ""Poker Face""

You know the scene-- a battered war veteran sits playing cards with the rookies and he tells them about that one time he was ""truly afraid"" and saw what the make-up of his commander really was.  In this episode Saito describes to the rookies his first encounter with the Major-- and the best part is that they weren't at all on the same side.  It's tons of fun to see a younger Batou and Ishikawa trade quips, and always fun to see a ""background"" character like Saito in the lead.

Episode 15: ""Afternoon of the Machines"" / ""PAT.""

TACHIKOMA!!!  That's right, it's the gang sitting around and playing philosophy again.  This episode sets up some of the more important parts of this season's Tachikoma arc.  While most of the crew is getting a tune-up and discussing the finer points of cybernetic life, Batou's personal Tachikoma goes with part of the Section 9 team to make some outside investigations... and the result brings the Tachikomas face-to-face with someone unexplicably familiar.

Episode 16: ""The Fact of Being There"" / ""Another Chance""

And all attention back to the main plot. This episode is spent slowly unveiling Kuze backstory.  The sad part?  Kuze's just not as ""cool"" as last season's Laughing Man.  The complex web be placed will pay off with a bang-up rest of the series...

Certain to be packaged with more delightful interviews and extras, let's hope that maybe Bandai/Manga Entertainment slip us OST 3 for the Special Edition.

Anyways, enjoy this disc-- there's only a couple more ""side-story"" episodes left, and then the final plunge; with a story arc that's more intense (and oddly inspired by the original manga) than most of what we've seen thus far.",1138924800,17,2750,4.829059829059829

8102777,4,B000DZ95N0,"After the Individual Eleven committed ritual suicide on a skyscraper roof last volume, Section 9 is left with the only one of the members that did not submit to the killing directive. He's the same guy that tried to kill the Prime Minister and his name is Kuze. He has a custom made cyborg body that makes him almost invulnerable to weapons or injury. He also has a very distinctive face, one so distinct that there's only one person in the country that could make it, but he's been killed by....Paz??!!  This is just the beginning of Volume 4's focus on the supporting cast, allowing background characters to receive the main focus. Episode 14 is about Saito's first encounter with the Major many years ago when they were on opposite sides of a war. Episode 15 concerns the Tachikoma's creator as he decides to flee to another country, taking his technological expertise with him. It's up to Section 9 to capture him before that happens, but along the way, the Tachikomas begin to question their own individuality and their own feelings(?) about their dad. The last episode brings Kuze's past to light as we get a glimpse of the man behind the mask...literally.

Volume 4, while a great anime, was a bit of a letdown in a way to me. While I liked the focus on some of the minor characters, their stories seemed a little tacked on to me. To me it felt like the creators said something like ""Let's write an episode about Saito"" without really fitting or adding to the larger story. The writing didn't seem as strong either. How many times have we heard the ""Let me tell you about the time...."" cliche during Saito's episode? They should have just played the episode with a ""10 years ago"" subtitle at the bottom instead of making it a flashback. I enjoyed the Tachikoma episode the most because sometimes those robots seem the most human of the entire cast, if that makes any sense. While it was subpar for this series, this volume still blows away most anime out there.",1149120000,4,1968,4.588068181818182
8102778,5,B000DZ95N0,"As a Journalist in the U.S., I am pleasantly surprised at how close 2nd gig is following real world situations, especially in the area of illegal immigration the U.S. I feel 2nd gig is providing us with a glimpse of the future and what ""might"" happen if President Bush gets his ""immigrant worker status"" approved. As far as Anti-Americanism is concerned, more people need to watch the first season and this current season (2nd gig) to understand how nations around the world perceive us. This is a wonderful mature series that needs to be placed along side some of the best movies and television shows that have received critical acclaim.",1147910400,6,638,4.8090909090909095
8102779,5,B000DZ95N0,"After watching this DVD I must say I am still very impressed with there work. however another reviewer said something that I believe needs to be corrected. the first and most obviouse error is the American Flag Patches. If you look at any american service man, or woman, you will find there flag is the same way. this is actually the correct way for it to look.

While I agree that ""make up"" has its flaws in that place, it just wouldnt have been the same exciting ending if it was otherwise.

The tachikomas and a philosophical element to a, for the most part, otherwise psychological anime.

This DVD is deep, and gives you some more back stories to the lesser known characters and I highley recomend it to any fan.",1144195200,3,717,4.458015267175573
8102780,5,B000DZ95N0,"I have been following the Laughing Man fansubs, so I've covered all this material before. I'm acquiring the DVDs as they come out to have legit copies.

The desc says 2 collectibles toys, it's actually 3. There is Batou on the plate like Motoko from Vol 3. In fact, the base plates fit together, which makes me belive that vol 5 will have another piece that will fit together to complete a composite set. The other two toys are the Chinese assassin with the gun-arm and the old robot unit from the organ-farming business (with the fake southern accent). These are easier to put together, I had problems with the Tachikoma from the last set, it broke when I tried to put the legs on. Haven't gotten around to the super-glue session yet.

The product itself: Stand Alone Complex - 2nd Gig continues some of the best animation and smartest television ever produced. Buy it, share it with those persons worthy/capable of appreciating it.",1143158400,11,933,4.682926829268292
