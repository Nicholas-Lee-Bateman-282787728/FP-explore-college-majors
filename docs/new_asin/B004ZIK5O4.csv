***Spoiler Alert***

Rehan's father is a Realtor and he is due to sell a Mansion called Glen Manor in 10 days. The caretaker of the Mansion died two days earlier so he asks for Rehan to go to this Mansion and investigate whether the rival Realtors have a hand in the mishaps. Rehan meets a stranger along the way who rambles about the haunting at the Mansion. He of course, does not believe this. He thinks that it's a ploy from the rival Realtors.

During his first night, he sees a girl playing a sad tune on the piano but she vanishes as soon as he opens the door. He soon learns about the girl from a letter that she left behind in 1936. Her name is Meera and her parents left her with her nanny Margaret, a servant and their driver because they urgently needed to go to Delhi.

We learn about her Piano Teacher, Iyer and the fact that he lusts over Meera. During her lesson, Iyer tries to rape Meera but she manages to hit him with a candle stand on his head. He dies. The police find explicit drawings of Meera at Iyer's house so they rule it off as self-defense.

Iyer returns as an evil spirit and he kills Margaret, the servant and the driver, by severing their heads. His spirit, continuously rapes Meera and soon after, she commits suicide. Rehan feels sad about what happened to Meera so he gets a psychic to help her. The psychic rushes out of the house - she warns Rehan to do the same. The evil spirit is far too strong. Rehan tests this by continually saying Iyer's name - he was told that once you say the spirit's name, you give it power.

The stranger that Rehan met before arriving at the Mansion, casts a spell and sends Rehan back in time to help Meera. Iyer hates Rehan because Rehan is now in his way. Things unfold and Rehan manages to get Meera out of the Mansion. Iyer finds a way to haunt them.

Overall, this is one of the scariest movies I've watched! It keeps you at the edge of your seat, gripping suspense, nail-biting scenes, causes goosebumps - it is worth your money! One of my favourite movies of all time!!! I was ""s*** scared"" after watching this movie...

8449826,1,B004ZIK5O4,Do not buy this movie!  The 3D is terrible (but you get 4 pairs of the old 3D cardboard glasses!) and the movie is even worse.  Totally silly and not at all scary-just stupid.  I got it just to try out my new 3D TV and BluRay 3D player and it didn't even do that very well (it only worked with the cheap cardboard glasses!).,1317945600,4,324,3.953846153846154
