7904313,3,B000006A58,"While not totally satisfying, Love Walked In is still quite watchable. The film skirts on the boundaries of film noir but never really goes there. Still there is an interesting unpredictability that carries through to the very end. Denis Leary is certainly not a great actor, but he often chooses interesting roles and he has a certain edginess and inner violence ready to explode that keeps the audience off balance wondering what he will do and/or say next. He uses that characteristic to very good effect in this film. Definitely worth a try.",1344729600,,545,4.870967741935484
