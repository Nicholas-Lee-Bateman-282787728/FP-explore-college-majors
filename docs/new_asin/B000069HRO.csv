7965649,1,B000069HRO,"As the other reviewer says, this is solely for the very beginners. Even so, not all first beginners are interested. Not only there are no combinations, most of the basic movements and positions are done by rather amateurish ballerinas. Even for the professional ones, which are scarce anyway, don't expect anything anywhere near the Kirov, De L'opera de Paris or Royal Ballet... The overall production is so and so. It takes quite an effort to finish this 50 min long DVD. I'm afraid few including the beginners will return to it, if at all.",1110240000,14,541,4.76595744680851
7965650,3,B000069HRO,"If you have kids that fancy taking ballet classes, then this dvd is perfect. However, if you are over the age of 13 and want a dance video for yourself, you might want to pick out something else. Perhaps something that doesn't have references to ""dancing like a fairy princess"" like this one does.",1097712000,27,297,4.518518518518518
7965651,5,B000069HRO,"I don't think the child who wrote the review has any concept of ballet whatsoever. If she did, she would know there is a crossed fourth, open fourth, a fifth and open fifth positions of the arms. And for her information, it is not an elementary DVD, so they have good reason to leave battements tendu out as a solo movement exercise as it is too simplistic for the target audience of the DVD.",1092096000,10,392,4.3108108108108105
7965652,5,B000069HRO,"Both DVD's are educational, motivational, and exciting. I was looking for an exercise program that not only challenged me in my senior years when muscle strength and flexibility are ebbing, but also would put me touch with my body. In the beginning, the workout is tough but, with practice, its is getting easier. For me, NYC Ballet Workouts are ""the grand poo-paa"". Thank you NYC Ballet.",1090713600,6,388,4.893939393939394
