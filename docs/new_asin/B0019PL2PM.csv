3443070,1,B0019PL2PM,I would have purchased this collection if Problem Child was NOT in it! This movie is SO bad I don't want any part of it. The child character is so awful you just want him to be run over by a bus. John Ritter is wasted here.,1251763200,,223,3.765957446808511

3443082,5,B0019PL2PM,"I only bought this comedy pack because I LOVE the movie Major Payne and Problem Child an it was cheaper to get this instead of buying them separately. I had never seen Kindergarten or Kicking and Screaming, but turns outs they were good movies too. This combo pack is definitely must have if you are looking for a good laugh.",1470960000,,325,4.433333333333334
3443083,5,B0019PL2PM,This is a set of four family movies.  I ordered this so that the smaller kids would have something to watch while at my house.  We have watched these over and over.  The only issue is that the kids each want to watch a different one so it cause an argument.  These have good quality and sound.  I personally love the Major Payne.  All of these movies are great and it is a great combination of moves.  I have so enjoyed these.,1465516800,,426,4.121951219512195

3443087,5,B0019PL2PM,"I bought this for Major Payne and Kicking and Screaming. I am not a movie critic.  It is a great deal because you get 4 movies for the price of one. I am not sure that young children should watch these but they are ""family""  movies.",1457654400,,232,4.021739130434782

3443105,5,B0019PL2PM,"I originally just wanted Major Payne, but when I saw I could get these 4 movies for about $3 each in one package, it was a no-brainer.  Kicking and screaming is proly my least favorite movie out of these 4, but they are all very good.",1393977600,,234,4.086956521739131
3443106,1,B0019PL2PM,Loved the movies.  The kids in my classroom were excited that we had some new movies.  It was so nice to buy four movies for that price.,1393891200,,136,4.0
3443107,5,B0019PL2PM,"Gave this pack of dvds to a ten year old and he loves it, what a deal for classic 90's movies, although kicking and screaming wasn't but whatever still good pack",1388016000,,161,4.225806451612903
3443108,1,B0019PL2PM,"This is not worth purchasing.  I bought it specifically for the Widescreen version of Kindergarten Cop.  However, after an A/B comparison, all that was done was pan-and-scan.  It's not Widescreen.",1373500800,2,196,5.466666666666667
3443109,5,B0019PL2PM,"I chose this because it had two of my favorites for a great price. Very pleased with my purchase. Quick delivery, definitely recommended.",1373155200,,137,5.0
3443110,5,B0019PL2PM,"love the package. good to see these shows again.
no problem with the disks at all, good work.................
thank you",1372550400,,119,5.0
3443111,5,B0019PL2PM,I recieved this  and watched all four movies in one day. I like that they put all four in one case and it saves space in my cd cabinet as well. It showed well and i love it. Great idea.,1371081600,,185,3.625
3443112,5,B0019PL2PM,"Major Payne and Problem Child are favorites!!  I laugh so much.  Both of them are somewhat dark humor however, you need to like that kind of comedy to appreciate the films.",1370390400,,172,4.516129032258065
3443113,4,B0019PL2PM,"My kids love Major Paine and Kindergarten Cop, they are both great kids movies and fun adults as well. They are the movies we got this pack for, it was cheaper to get the pack than those two movies separately. Kicking and Screaming was okay, not one I would probably watch again. Problem Child is about a very bratty child and I will not let my kids watch it again.  So even though two of the movies are not good the other two make up for it because they are ones you will watch again and again.",1370390400,,495,4.103092783505154
3443114,5,B0019PL2PM,Highly recommend this batch of movies.  Some of the funniest movies out there that keep it clean enough for the entire family to watch.,1367798400,,135,4.625
3443115,4,B0019PL2PM,For four old movies was kind of expensive at $10-15. I was hoping to pay $5 tops. Gave it four stars for content. Movies were viewed by a 5 and 13 year old who like them.,1365292800,,170,3.75
3443116,4,B0019PL2PM,"only chose this one for major payne, but the rest of the movies are good too. not a big fan of will Ferrell, but he does alright in kicking and screaming. kindergarten cop is a hoot, my children liked it, it is so tame from newer movies and a big change to watch on movie night",1364256000,,277,3.9642857142857144
3443117,5,B0019PL2PM,was looking for just one of the movies but found it with 3 others and for the price i couldn't beat it.,1359417600,,103,3.727272727272727
3443118,4,B0019PL2PM,"I love 3/4 of the movies here and I watch them constantly. I don't understand why kicking and screaming was included here, I really wish it had of been Problem child 2, but this was a great buy nonetheless.",1323388800,,206,4.3076923076923075
3443119,5,B0019PL2PM,"Finally, after years of only having crappy square-screen transfers or Kindergarten Cop and Problem Child, we can watch them the way that they were intended to be seen. Hopefully, one day they'll do another set with Problem Child 2 in it. Kicking and Screaming and Major Payne are just something that you'll have to deal with to get correct versions of the other two films.",1273363200,4,372,4.7384615384615385
3443120,4,B0019PL2PM,"What is great about this collection is that it offers the only anamorphic widescreen versions of Kindergarten Cop and Problem Child (The individual releases are full-frame only).
As a pretty big Ahnold fan, I always found Kindergarten Cop to be one of his underrated flicks. Its certainly much better than some of his other attempts to do comedy (Jingle All the Way, Junior, etc.)
Major Payne may be a by-the-numbers predictable comedy, but Damon Wayans' character makes the movie.
Problem Child is an old childhood favorite, and while it may not hold up as a comedy classic, there are a lot of laughs to be had.
My only complaint is the inclusion of Kicking and Screaming. Not a horrible movie, but not one of Farrell's most memorable either. Plus, as a newer movie (2002), it doesn't really place well with the others (all from the early 90's). I wish they had included Problem Child 2 along with the original instead.",1258243200,3,920,4.75625
