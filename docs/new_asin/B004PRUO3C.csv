8690958,5,B004PRUO3C,It's great to have an exercise video to do with my children!  It's not very strenuous (*you're* not going to get a workout doing this one) but it's a great way to get your kids' bodies moving - and the game-based exercises are fun. Appropriate for preschoolers.,1440201600,,261,4.553191489361702
8690959,2,B004PRUO3C,The pauses for explanation between the different moves were too long.  The kids lost interest because of that.  And the time spent doing each move went over long too.  My six and three year olds got bored quickly.  I had high hopes of this DVD being a way to be active indoors and beat the winter blues and I'm not sure we'll use the DVD again :(,1391731200,,346,4.119402985074627
