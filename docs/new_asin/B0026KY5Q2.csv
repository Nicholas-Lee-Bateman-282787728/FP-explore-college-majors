3854271,5,B0026KY5Q2,"""The Ice Follies of 1939"" is not a bad film by any means although Crawford hated it. She thought it was ""preposterous and the idea of she and Jimmy Stewart as skating stars was rediculous"". She also stated, ""I couldn't skate and the parts that I looked like I was skating I did on my ankles"".

 The film is a simple one in that Crawford plays an actress whose career is gearing up to its zenith point as her husband's career as an ice skater is coming to a halt. It's up to a producer to bring the two together.

 The last scene was shot in color, a rarity for a 1930's movie.

 Joan also did one of her better-known films in 1939, ""The Women"", which was far more successful than this.",1339459200,4,685,4.151515151515151
3854272,3,B0026KY5Q2,"Sadly apoor release of this nice MGM movie from the Warner Brothers Archive.

For not a restored film, the picture quality is pretty good. the scene in black and white and the final in color looks very good.

Starring Joan Crawford, Lew Ayres, James Stewart and in a supporting role: Lionel Stander (who became famous as Butler Max in 1979/80 in ""Hart To Hart"").

Poor: no english subtitles

Fazit: nice movie, but its not a musical (except some skating scenes) like the popular Broadway Melody etc.",1322438400,,499,4.767441860465116

3854275,4,B0026KY5Q2,"""The Ice Follies of 1939"" is really unlike any other Joan Crawford film because it's almost cartoonish and silly in a way, but it's not a comedy and although some sources have described it as a musical, it really isn't. I enjoyed this movie very much though because it's just another chapter in Miss Crawford's very long and historic film profession and showcases another element of her that was otherwise unseen. The film is a total of 83 minutes and is in black and white & color (final scene only).

After several prosaic films, Joan made ""Ice Follies"" which incidentally isn't even a quarter as good as any of the 4 or 5 films she made right before it. Nevertheless it's still a charming picture because Joan plays such a diverse role.

In this film, Joan plays Mary McKay an aspiring thespian who leaves her boyfriend to become a big actress. And in this picture we get to see Joan dressed and styled in lots of stunning gowns, dresses and outfits. She even appears as a platinum blonde, 2 decades before Marilyn Monroe.

My favorite scene is the very end when Mary (now going by the name Sandra Lee) attends the performance. Incidentally, it's in color, too, like Joan's **other** film from '39, ""The Woman"". Joan looked exquisite and just as beautiful and youthful as she did in her movies 10 years prior with that long dress and her fashionable wavy black hair.

Nearly every single feature film that Joan has appeared in has been released on DVD and/or VHS. Below is a list of her movies that have still not been released yet:

* Warner Bros. plans to release these films over the next couple of years under their Archive Collection branding on DVD.

Besides being included in a laser disc boxed set more than 10 years ago, this film has never been released until now. This new DVD is part of the Warner Archives series. You will find it for much less on their site, though.

In this film we also get to see the talents of Mr. Jimmy Stewart who plays Joan's boyfriend. Of course, like many of her MGM films, there's a subplot involving a subtle love triangle. But since the movie is such a piece of oversized fluff it's not overly serious nor is it the standard Joan Crawford formula.

One thing I really admire about Joan is that no matter how unimportant a film was, she always acted as if it were an overly produced drama. When Mary utters her lines to her boyfriend that she's leaving, it is beyond believable because Joan puts so much passion, energy and emotion into every syllable. And I don't need to tell you that after 100 films, this is hardly the exception for Miss Crawford, in the least.",1243296000,8,3736,4.664133738601824
8352929,4,B0026KY5Q2,"The Ice Follies of 1939 is a rather typical romantic comedy for it's time. I bought this because I really like Jimmy Stewart ( I highly recommend visiting the Jimmy Stewart Museum in Indiana, PA). But the biggest delight is the Technicolor sequence at the end of the film which features not only a very young and handsome Jimmy and Joan Crawford (first time in color!) but the historical and mesmerizing figure skating of Shipstad and Johnson, of Ice Follies fame. I can only imagine what eye - candy this sequence must've been on the big screen in 1939. The DVD is well worth it just for that reason.",1527206400,,601,4.522935779816514

8352933,4,B0026KY5Q2,"Certainly one of the oddest films in Joan Crawford's canon, ICE FOLLIES OF 1939 nevertheless offers her fans the rare chance to see her in glorious, blushing Technicolor, on ice skates, and in a platinum blonde wig!  ""Everyone was out of their collective minds"", the star later remarked.  But it's one helluva fun movie.

Trying to gain financial backing to produce his own ice-spectaculars, Larry Hall (James Stewart) finds himself playing second-fiddle to his new wife, Mary McKay (Crawford), when newly-christened as Sandra Lee, she makes a huge splash in Hollywood.  Split up for extended periods, chasing their own dreams, Larry and Mary are almost certainly headed for divorce... until film producers decide to bring their talents together for the screen.

Co-starring Lew Ayres, ICE FOLLIES OF 1939 was primarily a showcase for Crawford, and an attempt by MGM to cash in on the hugely-popular Sonja Henie films from rival studio Twentieth Century-Fox.  The ""Cinderella"" ice-show performed as the movie's finale was lensed in sumptuous Technicolor - an absolute event for Crawford's fans, who'd never before seen her in colour on the screen.  Despite the lush ice surrounds and Technicolor trappings this is still ""B"" territory - even for MGM standards - and this had to have irritated Crawford to the point where she campaigned and successfully landed one of the lead roles in the studio's next glittering prestige film ""The Women"", shortly after filming had wrapped on ICE FOLLIES.

If you enjoy Crawford you'll adore her on skates in ICE FOLLIES OF 1939.  The Warner Archive disc is bare-bones except for the standard trailer.",1440115200,2,1635,5.139622641509434

8352935,1,B0026KY5Q2,"Seriously this movie is about as interesting as watching paint dry. I felt new Joan fan's, and Ms. Crawford herself, are absolutely done an injustice to see this move receive 4.5 stars here when it is easily one of Joan Crawfords worst films if not the worst film of her career. The script is dull, story uninteresting, Joan's talent is waisted in what amounts to a supporting role. The one star is for seeing Joan in technicolor for a few moments at the end.",1436918400,,459,4.476190476190476

8352938,4,B0026KY5Q2,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some very quick thoughts on this movie...

The Ice Follies Of 1939 (1939) stars Joan Crawford and Jimmy Stewart.  This movie is far different than what Crawford usually did during her time at MGM, but it is quite entertaining and on the light side.  There is ice skating galore.  This movie comes off as an ice skating clinic at times, a musical at times, but the bottom line is that it's a very unique and different kind of movie.  Crawford gives her all in this black-and-white and color movie (the last scene was shot in color).  I think there's very good chemistry between Crawford and Stewart.

If you want to see an example of Crawford's versatility, then see this movie.  Recommended.",1389225600,4,754,4.651515151515151
