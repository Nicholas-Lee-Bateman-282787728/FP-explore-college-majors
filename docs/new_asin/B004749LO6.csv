4276052,1,B004749LO6,"THIS IS NOT A CONCERT FOOTAGE AT ALL, IT FEELS LIKE A DOCUMENTARY WITH PERFORMANCES (FROM DIFFERENT VENUES AND DATES) MIXED UP WITH ""CONFESSIONS"" AND STUPID COMMENTARIES FILMED BACKSTAGE. WHY DIDNT SHE RELEASE THE ENTIRE CONCERT WITH EXTRAS? I WAITED ANXIOUSLY FOR THIS BUT HATED THIS BLURAY EVEN THOUGH I TOTALLY LOVE BEYONCE.",1296259200,12,327,5.188679245283019
4276053,3,B004749LO6,"I thought The Beyonce experience was a much more REAL concert video.  This is good, but will make you feel like you are watching a produced video, lots of flashing back and forth between different venues, was giving me a headache.",1295913600,7,230,4.609756097560975
4276054,5,B004749LO6,Beyonce took risks and did really well. It is a great show and it is impossible not to feel energized after it. I definetely recommend it!,1294876800,,138,4.346153846153846
4276055,3,B004749LO6,"I continued to check Amazon to see if anyone would clarify if the DVD/Blu ray was indeed what we saw on the Thanksgiving special that aired on ABC. So let me be the first to say it does differ slightly from what was aired. The television special was edited and terribly if I must say.

This Blu ray sounds awesome, but I kept thinking what was the purpose of releasing it on Blu if we have to deal with in and out moments of grainy concert footage
and the writing on the top of the screen letting us know what city she is in?

We all know Beyonce has talent, she can perform well blah blah blah...she reminds me of janet in her prime. She works hard and I respect her for it.
Great Blu for your collection if you're a B fan.",1291939200,4,724,4.055944055944056
4276056,5,B004749LO6,"If I'm not mistaken, this is Beyonce's fourth concert DVD.  The first was essentially her solo debut, and was excellent, though lacking the refinement which was still to come.  The second was a strong contender for being my favorite, presenting us with a full concert recorded in LA, replete with spectacle, yet frequently able to move me emotionally in many directions.  The third was a definite change in approach, deliberately intimate, and thus revealing the person of Beyonce with a vulnerability we hadn't seen before.

Now this fourth DVD combines some elements from the previous three, while deleting some elements and adding new elements, and is therefore something quite different overall.  First of all, this tour has a modern feel, with a crisp looking stage and lighting, aerial acrobatics, a mini stage in the middle of the audience, etc.  The DVD itself is actually assembled from more than 100 performances worldwide.  This approach has the drawback of creating fragmentation, with many of the songs apparently being incomplete, so the effect is more like watching a mosaic rather than a single coherent and flowing concert.  Added to this, interspersed between the songs, we get mini interviews with Beyonce and other documentary-like clips, which contribute further to the sense of fragmentation.  Last but not least, we don't get to see as much of her superb band or dancers as I'd like, since the spotlight is more tightly focused on Beyonce than before.

While these are certainly drawbacks, the distinct upside of this approach is that, like a documentary, this DVD gives us a real sense of what it's like to actually be Beyonce, particularly while she's on tour, with all the pros and cons that entails.  In this sense, this DVD is even more revelatory than the previous one, displaying a Beyonce who's now secure enough to openly tell us that she experiences moments of insecurity.  She appreciates her gifts and success, while also wanting us to know that a lot of hard work and internal struggle goes into creating the externally charmed life that she leads.  She looks like a goddess on stage, but she also lets us frequently see that she looks a lot more like you and me without her makeup and styling.  She expresses sincere gratitude for her team and audience, but she also tells us that she has moments on tour when she feels very alone.  In short, she wants us to remember that, while she's a superstar, she's also human ...

For me, the bottom line is that I remain a huge fan of Beyonce, grateful that this DVD offers us yet another window into her artistry and life, not to mention a concert mosaic well worth watching.  If you're also a fan of Beyonce, this DVD is a must.  If you're not yet a fan, this DVD (or either of the previous ones) may convert you.  And remember that Beyonce's natural niche is stage performance, with all the theatrical elements that entails, so don't think you've genuinely experienced Beyonce if you've only listened to her songs or watched her videos - neither of those formats does justice to her.

My next step will be to try to watch Beyonce live in concert, and of course I eagerly look forward to her next DVD as well.",1291766400,23,3189,4.763636363636364

4276088,5,B004749LO6,"This is a wonderful concert and a must have for any Beyonce fan. Beyonce really put a lot of work into these shows her energy is contagious and just ever going like a machine she's like the female Michael of this Generation. Her vocals are strong,the choreography is on point and well done also love all the outfits and video content and behind the scenes footage. The Light and a Mic Bonus feature is a wonderful add it's nice to see how a tour comes together and how to prepare for it. Only disappointment is The Blu-ray book is only one Page with a photo inside,on the back and on the front but the DVD booklet is big with lots of high quality Photos i think the Blu-ray book should be the same as the DVD booklet but other than that this a amazing concert artist and package",1418774400,,778,4.263513513513513

4276092,2,B004749LO6,Toronto!  We were polite tomyo!  you were not. Taking yourself for a Queen??? Really ??? Not mine for sure nor musically or in showmanship ! but rather as a strip club cheap dancer within a group ofstrippers ... I am so glad my 15 and 16 year old did not see you pushing your ass into people's faces! Toronto was silent in front of your  gross unattractive vulgar tribal behaviors which no one I know cares to be part of! ! Beyonce... Really????  Thanks for making women's advancement.... I felt uncomfortable from the start and there is nothing wrong with ME!  I paid and spent my resources believing in your respect for Music.... Instead I got smelly stripping females... And I am not into women!,1374364800,,698,4.552
4276093,4,B004749LO6,"The best part about seeing Beyonc in concert is her legs. She is sexy from head to toe; the urban prototype of a beautiful woman; and you might be surprised how cute her face is with little or no make-up, but it's those legs that steal the show. And she knows it. So she wears skimpy outfits and exposes them to the world. Tina Turner, step aside. You're too old. That spotlight right there is for Sasha Fierce.

The gay guys and most of the girls in the audience cheer her on for a different reason. They're real fans, like of her music. So when she struts her stuff; a pretty loud-mouthed Diva oozing with charisma; they scream louder. Sometimes they even pass-out;  la Michael Jackson. But, while his Halo dedication, featuring a childhood clip of Beyonc about to go to his concert, is touching, her music simply can't compare.

I like her first solo album; Dangerously In Love; so this set starts off pretty good to me. But most of the newer songs leave a lot to be desired. I generally need catchy vocals in order to sing along. So it's up to the visuals to entertain. And that they do, with quick edits and flashy stylizations. Say whatever you want about Beyonc's singing; I say she yells too much; you have to admit, she does put on quite a show.

4276104,4,B004749LO6,"I saw the I Am...World Tour. I was fortunate to get exceptional floor seats and Beyonce, the background singers, dancers and musicians are phenomenal. However, when I bought the DVD/Blue-ray, I was not expecting to watch documentaries throughout the entire concert. After watching several documentaries after a while, it was like, okay enough already - stop cutting parts of the performance to show documentaries! At the concert, from my memory, a great portion of the narratives that are in the DVD/Blue-ray were shown during the concert, but mostly while Beyonce and her dancers changed costumes, and I think a few may have been shown as a background during Beyonce's performance. Therefore, it was fine to view live, because the performance did not feel as if the documentaries were smothering the performance. I wanted to see at home what I saw at the concert. Bottom line - the documentary would have been better served as additional footage on the DVD/Blue-ray.

Still, Beyonce is my favorite entertainer and I have not had a favorite entertainer/group since the 80s and 90s Michael Jackson, Prince and U2. She puts on a great show. Beyonce voice is strong and beautiful, she sounds incredible and it's amazing that you can understand each word that she utters - no matter how fast she's singing. She also is an incredible dancer, stunning, seems to be sincere and spiritually grounded. I would have given this 5 stars but the docudrama during the concert was a bit overkill. Still, anyone who is a fan of Beyonce or is undecided about Beyonce would enjoy this concert. By the way, I think the Beyonce Experience concert DVD/Blue-ray (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beyonc-Experience-Live/dp/B000WGZGNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beyonc Experience - Live!</a>) is better than the I Am...World Tour concert DVD/Blue-ray.
