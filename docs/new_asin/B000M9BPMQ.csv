8167412,5,B000M9BPMQ,I found this workout to be motivating and upbeat. It helped strengthen my core which in turn strengthened the rest of my body. Valerie is very professional in her instruction. She provides the ease to pick up the movements quickly and still maintain a high level energized workout. Her ability to combine pilates with kickboxing in the dvd is very rewarding. I would recommend this instructional video to all. Valerie is Awesome!!,1390262400,,430,4.986111111111111
8167413,2,B000M9BPMQ,"I purchased this based on the other 4 star reviews.
Are we talking about the same DVD?
First it is not 55 minutes, it is around 45. A pet peeve of mine concerning running times. I want to work out for at least and hour and so many of these have 15 minutes or so of talking.
Then the kickboxing! A lot of jumping up and down and kicking side to side, no routines here. The pilates is very basic and beginner, nothing to get excited about at all. The next section of kickboxing is a little better, but if you are used to Bill Blanks forget this one entirely. I gave it two stars for some good cardio.",1216857600,3,598,4.033613445378151
8167414,5,B000M9BPMQ,"Okay...here is the story...I found out about this on YouTube...I was lookin for ab routines and I found videos from pilates your way...next thing I know I'm lookin on their site and since I have always wanted to try pilates figured ""hey, why not?"". I'm not coordinated enough for TaeBo...but Valerie is good at breaking it down so you can learn the movements first. She is very motivating. The only thing I don't like about this DVD (and this is just a pet peeve of mine) is the surface that she is working out in is a hard plastic surface so you can hear every single step she takes. I love the pilates and I love the kickboxing! I'm telling everyone about this one! I hope she comes out with more!",1200960000,2,699,4.343511450381679
8167415,4,B000M9BPMQ,I was under the impression that this video combined Pilates with kickboxing movements (don't ask me how but..) but it did not.  What this video contains is a 20 minute kickboxing session then a 20 minute pilates session and then adds another 20 kickboxing session at the end.  THe pilates portion was pretty good and I did feel the burn after for such a short session.  Overall okay.,1183939200,5,383,4.602941176470588
8167416,5,B000M9BPMQ,"When my girlfriend told me that we should give pilates a try I laughed.  I 'm a bit of a jock and I told her there was no way I would ever do pilates.  Even more, I did not want to be rushing to a studio 3 nights a week trying to be on time for some class where I would have to do it in front of a bunch of people.  Then she ordered the ""Piladio"" video and we did the workout at home.  Having the ability to learn pilates at home, made it a much more enjoyable experience, because we could work out on our schedule.  The combination of Pilates and Kickboxing has made Pilates very enjoyable. It keeps it interesting and has helped us lose weight.  I highly recommend this video.",1176249600,2,678,4.022388059701493
8167417,5,B000M9BPMQ,"I have been a pilates fan for years but have never been able to find a workout that combined my interest in cardio with pilates until this video.  Valerie Minning is upbeat, friendly, professional, and an overall awesome instructor.  With other home workout dvds I have owned I have gotten bored within a few days with the workout and the instructor, but that has not been the case with this video.  Everyday I look forward to strengthening my core and continuing to challenge my body and mind with Valerie's help and support.  I would recommend this workout video to anyone who wants that body they wished they could have but never thought possible.",1176249600,3,650,4.725663716814159
