1691911,5,B000063UQU,"This is very enjoyable. I thought to myself as soon as I put it on, ""This is gonna be boring."" As soon as I witnessed the dialog, I thought, ""This is gonna be VERY enjoyable!"" His charm, smarts, and just his character all around is amazingly likable. I wasn't even wondering how much action was going to be on this DVD when I saw this awesome character.
  Don't worry action freaks, there's some of that too. Fast action. I'm talkin' about action that's so quick it takes a little replay in slow-motion. Whew, this guy really is a master with a sword. You can definitely tell when he's slicing. (The perfectly realistic choreography helps a lot as well.)
  I remember seeing ""Seven Samurai"", knowing it was one of the greatest ""films"" ever made by the master of film, but I wanted more of that stealth samurai action we all crave to see. For me I only saw it once in that movie. Remember that samurai towards the beginning that had a duel in the field? That guy was my favorite. That was the only scene, that one slice, that gave me the ""stealthness"". I'm sure there's other chambara films out there that I would love, but this one is the best so far. It's also so cool because it gives the awesome character at the same time. I don't want to see some boring actor swing a sword fast!
  If you like film, great movies, and realistic action, go for it...",1052524800,5,1353,4.370517928286852
1691912,5,B000063UQU,"The over 20 films Zatoichi films comprise arguably the most beautiful film series ever made.  Every frame is a work of art.
If you like moral ambiguity look elsewhere.  The plots are simple but classic fables (i.e.: ""fabulous"").  Zatoichi, the humble blind masseur, is a 15th century Columbo amiably bumbling along, and is played with great skill by Shintaro Katsu in all films.  But when a band of villains threatens some damsel, watch out, as Zatoichi pulls the sword from inside his walking cane.  Blind but sensing all movement around him, he becomes a whirling dervish of lethal steel.  No villain ever survives, though actual blood is rarely seen.",1051488000,5,653,4.944954128440367
1691913,5,B000063UQU,"I spent many an idle Friday evening while I attended graduate school watching Japanese chambara films at the Francis Parker school in Chicago, where they showed two such epics for a multi-national audience.  While the films were rarely subtitled, it made little difference.  The dialogue can be deduced from watching the movie and it's not why you watch Zatoichi.  The joys of this series are the incredible fight scenes, as the Blind Swordsman takes on all foes using his cane sword.  These movies are the westerns of Japan.  Don't come looking for a meaningful plot or deep messages.  Just sit back and watch the fastest swordsman around deliver flashing vengeance!  Highly recommended!",1034899200,,688,5.089285714285714
1691914,5,B000063UQU,"You don't even need to see any other Japanese films to immediately come to love the Zatoichi series. It really is a blessing to audiences, and to anyone looking for fresh and new material (well, some of it honestly is a retelling but, with Shintaro Katsu's unerring dedication and original acting stlye it makes you an instant fan). Sometimes you want to know, ""is he really blind or, is he just acting?"" The series of Zatoichi ""Master Ichi the blind swordsman, and traveling masseur"", is not only a must for any compulsive viewer but also a great series with plenty of thrills and acting followed by great story lines. In this the first installment (it's debateable by Ichi freaks), the tone is set not just for a follow up movie but for also a saving throw for the japanese cinema of it's day. As far as movies go and reacurring characters, this has got to be the (best) and longest series ever. And soon all (26?) of them are to be put into dvd format. (Ahh, what more could we ask for?) Here is where we are introduced to Shintaro (and a whole group of actors that with the trained eye you will see in other roles in the entire series) who nails the role with a very humorous and fresh approach. At first he almost plays the role of a wandering mystic who finds the unfortunate and downtrodden admist the vile gangsters of his day, but then you realize Zatoichi is himself a gangster but one who lives by different values and ethics. This draws you to Zatoichi's life and adventures he happens to come across or stumble into or that just fall into his lap. He is very human (with obvious limitations) which as a viewer can even make you feel for him and his role in a very contemporary story. The Ichi series is a great find for any fan of foriegn cinema. With anticipation we await the ongoing re-releasing of a truly unique anti-hero.",1033257600,11,1840,4.446745562130178
1691915,5,B000063UQU,"Well I have to admit that I am a Zatoichi freak. I have all these movies on VHS, but they are so good I will have to get them all on DVD as well. I can honestly say, for me that is, that I have never been dissapointed in any Zatoichi movie I have purchased. I can watch them time and time again and never get tired of seeing them. This type of movie making is a lost art today as well as the kind of character Zatoichi portrays. The action is great as well as the stories and the acting in these films. Thanks to great places like Amazon.com these movies can now be had by people who live in rural places that would otherwise be unavailable. I highly reccomend these movies, that is the whole series to anyone who likes good honest entertainment. Try one of these out, you may be surprised how much you enjoy it.",1032912000,,812,4.113207547169812
1691916,5,B000063UQU,"Before clint eastwood rode the American west as the man with no name, righting injustice with a lightning quick draw, a blind swordsman name Zato Ichi wandered the historical landscape of japan, embodying basic values of fairness and, like Eastwood's character, vanishing off the stage at the movie's end (sometimes even with a setting sun). This DVD begins the Zato Ichi saga and sets the stage for all the rest to come (26 in all).  The premise is delightfully outlandish.  The character reminds me of the blind Marvel comic book hero ""Daredevil,"" whose heightend sense of hearing allowed opponents to be located by the sound of their movement.  Ichi never draws his sword first, but he is always the last man standing, as he takes on one opponent, two, three, four, etc.  But for all his seeming superhero like qualities Zato Ichi is drawn in all too human ways and viewers will find themselves touched by a sensitive portrayal of a man who is isolated from the world and from any sustained relationships.  His entire life is lived ""in the dark.""  I do not know for sure, but I am guessing that the successful spagetti westerns that made eastwood's career were inspired by this earlier series.  The plot of this first film will seem familiar, but the japanese setting lends the story an interesting slant that holds one's attention.  And the acting of Shintaro Katsu raises the caliber of the movie to a level of delight.  These films celebrate basic human values of honesty, trust and compassion.  They also lift up more culturally slanted values of the Japanese culture like duty, ""saving face,"" and honor.  I enjoyed this film and will look forward to more to come.  Having seen this before on television, I was especially pleased with the appearance of this B & W print and the well done subtitles.  It has a great look.  It tells a good story.  And I can't think of a better way to pass an hour and a half on a rainy Saturday afternoon when I'm sitting at home with my dog.",1024876800,7,1981,4.636103151862464
1691917,3,B000063UQU,"I'm not an ""Ichi-freak"", as the liner notes call the fans.  I came to this out of curiosity, especially considering that the low price combined with HVE meant a good transfer at the very least.
Technically, this is quite good.  The director makes some very interesting choices visually, and the acting is very strong.  Also, HVE's subtitle crew has spoiled me; they're probably the best in the business these days.
But, really, this isn't much more than an appetizer for the very similar ""Yojimbo"", and interesting as a prelude to the nihilistic and violent cinema that would come later; Zatoichi himself is simply a weary gunslinger, but the contempt the movie views both of the gangs with is telling.  Zatoichi is an interesting anti-hero, but we get more talk about how incredible and skillful he is with his sword than we actually SEE on the screen, at least in this episode.
So, if you're curious or a student of film, dig in.  If you're just looking for a samurai flick, go for the great one and buy ""Yojimbo.""",1024012800,2,1016,4.685393258426966
1691918,4,B000063UQU,"Criterion in association with Janus Films has exquisitely remastered the first two of 26 sequels in the life and adventures of Japan's most popular and enduring cinematic hero, Zatoichi, the blind swordsman.  A common man with an extraordinary skill and an even greater moral imperative.
""THE TALE OF ZATOICHI"" introduces the legendary character and its star, Shintaro Katsu. This film from 1962 also introduced a new era of samurai film.  Zatoichi, a lowly blind masseur who practices in a small province gets caught in a turf war between rival yakuza gangs.  Yakuza honcho Sukejuro, aware of Zatoichi's reputation with his deadly cane sword, tries to hire him -- unsuccessfully -- as a mercenary.  Unfortunately, Shigezo, the other gang leader, has already hired a fierce warrior with an equally intimidating skill to challenge Zatoichi. Thus, the legend begins.  The finely honed story is greatly enhanced by the stunningly choreographed action.  The black and white widescreen picture looks great and the English subtitles are easy to read.  Bonus material includes a gallery of original theatrical stills.",1022716800,76,1110,5.344827586206897
1691919,4,B000063UQU,"This is the first in a series of 20-plus films about the blind swordsman, traveling masseur, and low level gangster Zatoichi. This is a truly incredible series that makes its hero more credible than some of the new-school martial arts heroes of today. Shintaru Katsu has created a very sympathetic hero. The action scenes remind me of Kurosawa'a work ( the fight choreography changes in the later entries ). My only gripe is that the outdoor night scenes look a little murky which is why I gave this picture 4 stars. Otherwise, it's a minor quibble and, for a 40 year old film, looks great!",1022544000,6,590,4.628571428571429
1691920,5,B000063UQU,"The first Zatoichi film I ever saw was ""Zatoichi vs. Yojimbo"" and it left me feeling biased to the older, B/W films as well as stuck on ""Seven Samurai"". Like a number of other ""samurai"" pics, this isn't just slash and rip non-stop mayhem- there's a story going on here. I would compare this first in the series to the story in ""Yojimbo"" where two sides are being played against each other, and in Zatoichi's case there's another swordsman whose skill and respect is thrown into the equation. Shintaro Katsu exudes a quirky air of dangerous skill mixed with worldly determination, and plays blind convincingly. I bought this without having seen it already and I must say it was a pleasant surprise! There IS plenty of action, the pace doesn't necessarily lag on account of side-story, and Janus Films provides yet another beautifully restored widescreen print with clear and easy-to-read subtitles. This is a good buy for the price and I plan to get as many of the series as I can...",1022025600,12,982,4.715116279069767

1692112,4,B000063UQU,"The blind swordsman Zatoichi (Katsu Shintaro) becomes involved in a war between gangsters and forms a bond of friendship and respect with the man who is supposed to kill him (Amachi Shigeru).

This is the first in a long-running series of samurai films starring Katsu, who displays great skill both as an actor and a martial artist.  His relationship with Amachi, an idealized form of Bushido honor, leads to a surprisingly moving finale.  Like many samurai films, this one laments the passage of a nobler time by presenting characters whose staunch principles reflect unfavorably on men of lesser morality who also follow the way of the sword.

When I lived in Japan, I was surprised that the American TV character Columbo was so popular there, especially among older Japanese.  Now that I have seen this film, that mystery is largely dispelled--both seem unassuming , mild, and a little slovenly, which causes others to underestimate them.  Yet, due to their superior skills, they always come out on top.",1337644800,,1006,4.994011976047904
1692113,5,B000063UQU,"This is the first of many films plus TV series which tell the tales of Zato Ichi, a blind masseur and swordsman. Instead of being a member of the samurai caste, Zato Ichi is a very low-ranked outcaste. He is a ""zato"" which is a designation for a low-ranked itinerant blind masseur, a sub-category of the ""hinin"" (non-human) caste.  His given name is Ichi, thus ""Zato Ichi."" This series of films features one of the few outcaste characters in Japanese films.

WARNING: Possible spoiler: This first tale begins with Ichi, the traveling blind masseur. Ichi looks very helpless as he stumbles his way over a bridge and comes into a town. He joins into a dice game at the local gambling establishment. At first, he acts dumb and deliberately loses. The second game, he reveals his knowledge and wins the game. The local thugs are very angry, they attack him and call for their boss to take care of this ""insolent blind bastard."" The boss appears and he instantly recognizes Ichi as a very skilled swordsman. He orders one of his men to give Ichi a bath and a massage. So we see Ichi receiving a massage rather than giving one out. The boss wants to hire Ichi to help him in a gang war with a rival yakuza gang. Ichi refuses the offer.

While fishing for food, Ichi meets Hirate Miki, a consumptive ronin. The two, both being on the margins of Japanese society, readily become friends. Hirate talks about how low he has come in life as a former samurai separated from his old clan, having become a ronin who considers himself a failure. He tries to cover up the fact that he's quite sick. Ichi talks about how he had decided to take up the sword a few years earlier because as a low-caste hinin blind masseur, he was being mistreated and disrespected by others. The two learn to respect each other because of their sword skills and their outsider status in society.

There are other sub plots, one involving a young woman who falls in love with Ichi. Ichi is attracted to the sweet woman, but is afraid that his life as a wandering blind masseur and gambler wouldn't be suited for a lovely young woman, so he refutes her love.

However, the main plot involves the relationship between Ichi and Hirate Miki. Hirate knows that he is dying and only wants to die quickly as a warrior rather than die miserably and slowly. He gets the idea that he would like to fight with Ichi. Ichi knows that Hirate wants to die and is reluctant to fight this duel, especially if it involves a completely meaningless quarrel between two yakuza gangs, each one as thuggish as the other. This relationship is poignant and we know that Hirate is fated to fight and die -- and get his wish. Ichi wanders off to his next destination as he must.",1325203200,,2714,4.496957403651115

Truly an amazing story. This film and ""Z meets one arm swordsmen"" are my favorites. Check them out, they are an amazing part of cinematic history; you will not be disappointed.",1211414400,,485,4.094736842105263
1692115,4,B000063UQU,"The Zatoichi saga, covering the years 1962-1989, are truly remarkable in the history of cinema. There are no bad episodes. Some are average, above averge, good, very good, and great. But each episode is a wonderful excursion into the character played by the late Shintaro Katsu. I liked them as a young boy, viewing them with my best friend in theatres in Los Angeles, and I like them now. If not more. This is truly one of the greatest series not only in Japanese cinema, but cinema anywhere.

This first film of Zatoichi, starring the late Shintaro Katsu must not be judged by the standards of today's technological advancements. If anything, the stories are much better than the glutted CGI enhanced movies that claim to be films. THESE ARE FILMS. Truly outstanding films. If you are new to the series, give them a chance. I am sure you will find some that will appeal to you.

This first episode of Zatoichi is more drama-based than the ensuing films we be. But it is the nature of the character Ichi, in this episode, that will set the tone for the other episodes: Honor, integrity, believer in the Bushido code, and defender of the oppressed. And as the beginning episode shows, there is a humorous and humble manner in which Ichi carries himself. Never the braggart, always willing to assist--and lethal with his cane-sword.

In this episode, when Ichi is hired by a gang leader to fight a sick samurai: One in which Ichi has come to like. Ichi would rather drink and break food with this samurai; but events lead to another path. A path that would lead to confrontation. And the destiny of Zatoichi will take him on a long journey, frought with peril and villianous characters. I highly recommend this first episode of Zatoichi, and hope you will give the others a look. They truly are remarkable.",1157328000,12,1805,4.669811320754717
1692116,5,B000063UQU,"The reason I had to get this movie, and will likely collect more of the sequels, is Shintaro Katsu.  I saw some of his latter work and wanted to see his earlier movies.  So I got the first Zatoichi flick.  And I am happy I did.

There is a story here.  The basic plot of two rivel yakuza gangs fighting over the same turf.  Common enough story.  But that's just it - the movie stays on the story.  Little or no sword fighting happens till the end of the film.  Most of the scenes, most of the energy, focus on the characters and their interaction.  The details that made a fair movie great overflow from the screen.  Zatoichi is not a Hero or a Samurai, just a blind masseur trying to make a buck and stay out of trouble.

I would suggest it to any fan of Samurai films or even a beginner who wants to see an uncommon Samurai flick.

He is a wandering former Yakuza who had become a champion of the common man through his sense of justice and his deadly cane sword.  His hightened senses allowed him to prevail with sword and dice alike.  Classic Japanese Chambara - one against many - good against evil.

1692120,4,B000063UQU,"This first DVD (movie) is the Japanese version of the classic American western.  Zatoichi is a blind samurai who is a reluctant member of the yakuza.  As such, he is hired by a local yakuza leader to fight in an upcoming war against another boss.  The movie is interesting and Zatoichi is an interesting character.
That said, there are a few problems.  Some of the subplots don't work very well and seem to have been added to fill the movie.  From the DVD, I was a bit disappointed with the subtitles.  I won't say they are actually domesticated, but they aren't the best.  So minor things end up being untranslated.  Also, the translators decided that certain terms should just be given the character's name. For example, Zatoichi asks where a certain guy is and the Japanese lady says her ""oniisan"" (brother) has just stepped away.  The translator decided that rather than say ""My brother has just stepped away"", to just use the brother's name.  It may seem a minor point, but the female character is saying that the male character is her brother.  That doesn't come across in the subtitles when the character's name is used.  Also, the translator decided that when Zatoichi addressed the other samurai with the ""-san"" honorific, this meant ""Master"".  Well, that's not what he said and not what he meant.  Other characters addressed the same samurai with the ""-san"" honorific and that was ignored.  This may be minor, but I like for the subtitles to be accurate yet readable.
Bottom line: a nice, classic Japanese movie.  Well worth spending time watching.",1085702400,13,1558,4.8007518796992485
1692121,5,B000063UQU,"""Zatoichi, the Blind Swordsman"" is as delicate a film as a feather to a sword. It follows the blind massuer of the title who has taken up the ways of the sword as he visits a gang leader on invitation and gets caught up in the imminent turmoil brewing with rival gang, Sasagawa. The film's plot is nothing new or original as far as the genre is concerned; it's one part ""Yojimbo,"" one part ""Sanjuro."" However, the vivid focus on characterization leads this film into the realm of the unique. Unlike such films like ""Yojimbo,"" where Toshiro Mifune served as the rough cutting tool to slice up carboard bad guys, Zatoichi brings the focus down to the characters, driving the story with quiet emotion and sub plot rather than rousing music and bloodshed. The film is already onto something interesting with it's quiet, almost enigmatic, blind hero, but then it pits him against an alcholic samurai who is looking for a good final duel to go out on. And what a duel it is, filling the width of the widescreen atop a ragged bridge in the middle of turf war. The only thing that would have made it more dramatic would have been rain, but with the emotions this film grants its characters and the relationships it builds between them, who needs rain? The film steadily progresses into a poetic, moralistic tale of lonliness, destiny, and responsibility for the choices we make in our lives. The story is simple, but it's point is as piercing as the blind massuer's sword. To that degree it's got Kurosawa beat.",1070755200,18,1503,4.632958801498128

Film = three (3) stars; restoration/preservation = four (4) stars; cinematography = three (3) stars; set design = barely three (3) stars; choreography = two (2) stars.  Think you've seen every flavor of Japanese movie sword swinger?  How about a self-taught amateur who is also blind?  And very deadly!  Director Kenji Misumi deploys Tokugawa Period yakuza-gang warfare as a backdrop for a fascinating personality analysis of a masseur turned wandering master of swordplay whose sightless handicap is more of an advantage than a disability.  (Perhaps with the help of a little magic?)  Misumi's photo-play provides more talk than action and seems to have been adapted from a stage play (or the script writers learned their craft in the live theater?).  Interestingly, ancient yakuza gangs closely resemble those depicted in contemporary films (instead of not being able to shoot straight, they are unable to slash straight and rely on hired swords (usually unemployed samurai)!  Acting is consistently good despite terrible choreography.  Characters often only have to waive their wooden swords at stunt actors to get them to fall over (the dialog tries to cover this obvious short coming by repeating lines that say sword play is too fast to be seen!).  Sound-stage ""exteriors"" look and sound phony.  Cinematography (2.35 : 1, black & white) is mostly well done especially the interior dolly shots.  Not so much for panning which serves mainly to induce horizontal vertigo in the viewer (wide-screen formats and rapid pans don't play well together!).  Subtitles are close enough for Kansei-ben deliveries.  Restoration/preservation is good.  Adult make-believe fun.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1505520000,,1866,5.362068965517241
