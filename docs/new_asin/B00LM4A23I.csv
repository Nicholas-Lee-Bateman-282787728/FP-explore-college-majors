6491140,1,B00LM4A23I,My 4 year old has taken interest in everything Hot Wheels. I decided to buy this movie since he watches some on Netflix. I normally make a point to watch everything he watches unless I know it's something I trust. This movie I didn't fully watch it because it's so awful I can't even stand it. He wants to watch it constantly too. If you can avoid it do so the plot is awful and just can't stand the annoying hot wheels kids in this movie.,1457049600,,439,4.116279069767442

6491151,5,B00LM4A23I,My 5 year old loves this movie. A little inappropriate at certain parts but he knows what's ok to repeat or not. A funny movie for those silly young boys.,1442016000,,154,4.166666666666667

6491154,2,B00LM4A23I,"We watched Team Hot Wheels: The Skills to Thrill on Netflix and the kids (5 & 3) really enjoyed it, as did I. It had funny humor that an adult can appreciate but enough action and silly for the kids. This movie- The Origin of Awesome- was NOT a good movie. The story had no progression and there were plenty of off color jokes. The action was repetitive and lost the kids attention quickly. Another reviewer mentioned a giant pooping pigeon and I thought, it can't be that bad. But it is. It's not like the bird is flying and poops- it shows the poop shooting out of its anus- not really sure how to delicately put it. Glad we only rented it instead of buying.",1441152000,2,660,4.246031746031746

6491161,1,B00LM4A23I,"THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE CALLED ""THE ORIGIN OF AWFUL""!
PLEASE, DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE MOVIE!  THIS IS A PATHETIC, CRUDE, AND STRANGE MOVIE.  THERE IS NO VALUE TO IT WHATSOEVER. HE CHARACTERS ARE TWISTED BRATS WHO USE LOW BROW POTTY TALK.  IT IS ""NOT RATED""  AND PARENTS MIGHT ASSUME IT WAS WRITTEN FOR YOUNG CHILDREN.  I TWO KIDS WHO LOVE HOT WHEELS - THIS WAS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY EVER.  I RARELY WRITE REVIEWS, BUT THIS DESERVES ONE!  IF I COULD GIVE THIS A RATING LESS THAN ONE STAR, IT WOULD BE ""NEGATIVE 10 STARS""  THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER GREAT CLEVER AND FUNNY KIDS MOVIES OUT THERE. THIS ONE IS NOT ONE OF THEM - AND I HAVE SEEN SOME BAD MOVIES...BUT THIS ONE IS THE WORST!!  IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN WHO LOVE HOT WHEELS, YOU ARE BETTER OFF LOOKING ON YOU TUBE FOR SOME CAR CLIPS.  WHEN WE WATCHED THE ""BEHIND THE SCENES"" OF THIS MOVIE, I WAS MOST SHOCKED AT HOW PROUD THE WRITERS OF IT WERE - THEY ACTUALLY THOUGHT THERE WAS A CLEVER PLOT - I CAN'T BELIEVE THE MAKERS OF THIS MOVIE SHOWED THEIR FACES ON CAMERA!  NO, NOT CLEVER AT ALL!  THE SAD PART IS THE WRITERS HAD AN AUDIENCE OF KIDS AND PARENTS WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A FUN FAMILY MOVIE.  I AM ANGRY I ADDED TO THEIR PROFITS BY BUYNG THIS GARBAGE.  THE ONLY THING YOUR KIDS WILL GET FROM IS MOVIE IS LISTENING TO CHARACTERS TALK LIKE BRATS, TREATING EACH OTHER POORLY AND USING INAPPROPRIATE LANGUAGE.
DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY!",1431820800,3,1422,4.1611721611721615
6491162,2,B00LM4A23I,My son likes it (he is 5) but I definitely wish I hadn't actually paid money for it.  Just don't like the attitudes and tones of voice of the characters.  Nothing specific.,1429747200,,172,4.34375
6491163,4,B00LM4A23I,"My 5 year old son loves this movie.  He has watched it so many times that it was totally worth buying it off Amazon Digital movies.  I would say if you have a kids who loves potty humor, toy cars and silliness, this is the movie for them",1429747200,2,237,3.9166666666666665

6491174,5,B00LM4A23I,"According to my four year old son (almost five) he would rate this movie more than infinity stars!  LOL  He fell in love with this movie when he watched the trailer on Netflix, so of course he added the DVD to his Christmas list.  We've had it just over a month now, and already he's watched it more than a dozen times.  Even his seven year old sister has watched it with him several times over the past weeks.  The storyline is very simplistic and kid appropriate--not very appealing for adults, at least not to me, what with the giant pooping pigeon!  LOL  Nonetheless, for a four year old who is a Hot Wheels fanatic, this movie is just about perfect.  It's action packed and fast paced; and the graphics are incredible!  It may not be the most intelligent story around, but it's vastly entertaining, and keeps my kids enthralled.  Love it!",1422921600,6,843,4.4868421052631575

6491177,1,B00LM4A23I,This show has too much violence and inappropriate language for my 4 year old.  Which is sad since we thought it would be a good movie.  We shut it off after 5 minutes. Don't waste your money,1420502400,3,190,4.108108108108108
6491178,1,B00LM4A23I,"I completely regret the purchase of this movie.  My six-year-old son has recently taken interest in Hot Wheels cars, and so I thought this movie would be fun.  Boy, was I wrong!  I have a high tolerance for kid movies.  I do not mind the insanely unbelievable plot: It's a kids movie, made to promote a product line.  I did not expect greatness.  I do not mind occasional ""potty humor.""  In fact, sometimes farts really are funny.  I don't mind random humor that appeals to kids, like The Lego Movie.  That being said, THIS movie is ridiculously disgusting, loud, and obnoxious!!!  A giant pigeon!?!  Pooping giant disgusting poops on townspeople!?!  REALLY???  I am not making this up!  And I don't appreciate Larry (the mechanic and mentor who created ""Team Hot Wheels"") advising the boys on the team: ""No taking the chickies to make-out point!""  Seriously.  I really did not make this stuff up.  Also, this movie features infusing animal DNA with cars to make mutant cars, a psycho robot bent on destroying the town, and a giant robotic Abraham Lincoln building log cabins out of ELDERLY PEOPLE!  I really wish I was making this stuff up.  I really wish this was a clever and sarcastic joke review.  But it is not.  This is a really stupid movie.  I am going to have to conveniently lose this DVD, or something.  My fault for not watching this with my children the first time.",1420156800,28,1379,4.630705394190872

It's approprate for my three year that can't watch some of the other hotwheels shows; and it's very entertaining in general.

6491193,5,B00LM4A23I,"I had never heard of Team Hot Wheels before this but glad I came across them.  My kids and I really liked this DVD.  Its about a group of friends, who are racers, who have to work as a team. I love the concept of teamwork and problem solving.  The animation really impressed me as well, especially for a straight to DVD title.  We watched this multiple times so far and my kids have yet to get sick of it.  They have asked for more of Team Hot Wheels!

What is neat though is my kids have been playing with their Hot Wheels track sets more lately and building crazy ramps for their cars.  I like that the DVD is encouraging them to play with their toys and inspiring creativity.  There is nothing inappropriate for young kids and I'd recommend it for any parent looking for a fun new DVD for their kids!",1413417600,3,803,4.2026143790849675
