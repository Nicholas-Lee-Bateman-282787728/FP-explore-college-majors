It  is interesting to note that the director of this film also was the director of Deep throat, in as much as both films really broke the mold of what a porn movies were  supposed to be. Deep throat is considered by some to be the greatest money making film of all time, period. Not just in the porn realm.

How accurate they are I really don't know. I could do more research on the subject, but honestly just don't care that much about the matter.

I think you will be surprised at just how good the camera work is considering the Genre from which it spawned from. So don't be a square.

3158811,5,B0016L5B1A,"After his success with the adult movie 'Deep Throat"" back in the early 1970's, Director Gerard Daminao decided to make an adult movie that would be more artistic.  The filming of the scenes in this movie are great.  The movie also has a nice soundtrack to it.

It is about a middle aged spinster who, depressed with her life, commits suicide.  There is a graphic scen in which Miss JOnes played by adult acress Georgina Spelvin gets into a bathtub full of water and takes a razor blade as they show her graphically slashing her wrists.  She then lays back in the bathtub and you see the water turning red from the blood gushing from her slashed wrists.

Miss Jones finds herself in a room with this man, the Evil we can persume.  He is dresed in a business suit and takes like a professional businessman.  He has this large file in front of him that he has just finsihed reviewing.  It is the file of Miss Jones life.

He tells MIss Jones that the file is excellent and tells her that by all rights, she should have gone to the other place, but she took her own life, and the higher office cannot forgive that.  He tells Miss jOnes that there is a problem now, because due to the increased influx of souls being sent to hell these days, they are at the moment unable to accomodate her and provide her with a place.

MIss jones asks him if then they could allow her to use the time to experience the sultry and wicked things in life like sex.  Teh mand/devil thinks about it for a moment and decides that this just might prove interesting, a spinster, a virgin, exploring and experincing every sort of sex act that she can and desires.  He agrees, and arrangements are made.  She is first sent to a mentor played bvy adult actor Harry Reems (of Deep Throat)to provide training and to take her verginity.

Miss JOnes manages to go on to exceed everyones expectations.  She is having a good time doing so, but the day comes when it is time.  Time to go to her punishment.  She reluctantly takes the devil by the hand and then finds herself in a padded cell with this insane male cell mate in there with her.  miss jones body is consumed with erotic desire as she pleads to the man in the cell to please give her what she wants.  The man, however, is looking around the cell looking for a fly that comes out at night and pesters him while miss JOnes is left crying and pleading adn being consumed by a desire that she will never be able to satisfy for eternity.

The actress, Georgina Spelvin (her assumed name), had worked as an actress when she was younger.  She had appeared in plays and musicals in Txas where she came from.

MIddle aged, she was was no longer working as and actress.  She had gotten a job as a cook on the set of ""Teh Devil in Miss JOnes.""  She would cook for the actos and director and camera ment on the set.

Gerard Damiano, knowing of her acting experience, had her coach some of the sult film actors.

On the day that the movie was to be shot, the girl who was originally cast to play the part of MIss Jones had gotten ill and called in sick.

Gerard Damiano was now in a bind.  They were all set to film and not star actress.  Adult films do not have big budgets, so something like this can be disasterous.

Gerard Daminiano then asked Georgina Spelvin if she wanted to play the part.  Needing the money, being that she would be paid a lot more than she was getting as a cook, she took the job.

She took the name ""Georgina Spelvin.""  This was a female version of the name ""George Spelvin,"" which actors use when they are in a movie or play in which they don't want their real name to be used.

Gerard Daminao made cahnges to teh script and made Miss Jones a middle aged ""spinster instead of a young woman in her early twenties.

It all ended up working out.

8263029,3,B0016L5B1A,"I remember when my wife & I went to see this movie just over forty years ago at the adults only theater in the Big Apple.
I can honestly say that it has definitely sprinkled some pepper throughout our love making at certain times,, Hey !, why not ?!.
The quality of the (remastered copy) DVD version is fair, but all-in-all, it's passable.
The story is about a young ladies self destruction which leads her to what I interpreted as Purgatory.
As her lifestyle is being annualized, it's discovered that except for the sin of taking her own life, she really hasn't done
anything terrible for her to spend eternity in Hell. Being that she understood where she was going to end up, she asks if she
can stay their and do things that she never did while she was alive, one of course was to loose her virginity.
This story does contain bi-sexual acts and there are sex scenes with a snake, fruits and threesomes.
Georgina Spelvin portrays Justina Jones,(Miss Jones), Harry Reems portrays the Teacher and Gerard Damiano, Mrs. Spelvins husband, and who also had a scene in the movie, was the director.
Hope this review is of good use for you, Thank you . . .
