2115138,5,B0002PUDPK,"DVD has lots of programs, involving many cardio workouts that get your heart racing and the blood flowing.  Many integrated kickboxing moves and weight training exercises which is a little odd but refreshing for at home workout videos.  The abs routine had my abs burning for days following.  I cant say enough positive things about this DVD.",1099353600,2,342,4.964912280701754
2115139,5,B0002PUDPK,"I cant say that get get impressed that often and I have a huge supply of fitness videos, but this DVD is how every video should be I feel. For one you can't be the value.  Tons of workouts that you can use whenever you want for whatever reasons.  I love the fact that I can workout for 45 minutes or if I am in a hurry or short on time exercise for 10-15 minutes.  The instructor Meghan is aweinspiring. Not only does she have an incredible body herself, but she also has an extensive knowledge of fitness which easy translates to the audience.  Id say you cant beat the value and I loved it so much I bought ""Ultimate Body Beginning Workouts"" for my mom and ""Yoga for Everybody"".  Do yourself a favor and check them out.",1099008000,,721,4.195652173913044
2115140,5,B0002PUDPK,"Im a certified fitness instructor and personal trainer.  I train clients at the gym or at home and I am always looking for fitness products that I can recommend that my clients use at home.

This DVD is great for many reasons, most notably the amount of variety.  Often times the excuse I hear is I just don't have enough time, which is utter nonesense.  While every trainer preaches about making fitness a part of your lifestlye, yours truly included, its important to have variety, especially on days when your super busy or your body needs a lighter or recovery workouts from pervious days.  This DVD has that and more.  The weight training and cardio sessions are immacultely done and the ab exercises will have your stomach burning.

Id say this is a well addition to any home library and supplements just about any workout.  Highly Recommend!",1098921600,5,848,4.72108843537415
2115141,5,B0002PUDPK,"This DVD offers up tons of workouts for about every every occasion. The workouts get the heart pumping quick and fast, which I love and may waist had begun to shrink in just a few short weeks.  Id say I've already lost about 10 lbs.  I originally saw this DVD in the Los Angeles Times, and picked it, up.  Ive been very pleased and highly recommend.",1098835200,3,349,4.257575757575758
2115142,5,B0002PUDPK,"I workout religiously, but because of my schedule I am not always able to get to the gym on top of traveling so much these days.  I picked this DVD up cause the model looked good, plus Id heard good things about some of the other products by this company and decided what the heck lets give it a try.  I loved the kick-boxing series and all the squats and stuff..which have been working great for my glutes.  Ab work is challenging and my stomach feels and looks tighter than it has in months.  The instructor makes you want to work hard to look as good as she does, but more importantly Id say she knows what she is talking about and she makes the routines fun.",1098835200,6,662,4.188976377952756
2115143,5,B0002PUDPK,"Picked up tis DVD after recommedation from the Los Angeles Times.  I was curious to whether or not the DVD offered as much variety as stated by the LA Times and boy was I not disappointed.  My workouts change according to whether or not I have the to get the kids off and ready for school, travel, you name it.  There were dozens of workouts to chose from and custmize according to time.  I use to do Tao Bo a few years ago, so I love the kicking boxing element contained on the DVDs and all the cardio stuff.  My butt and abs are tighter than every, and youd never get a complain out of me otherwise.  A fantastic choice and defintely an added plus to any at home fitness routine.  I highly recommend.",1098835200,2,702,4.1940298507462686
2115144,1,B0002PUDPK,"I'm always looking for new workouts because someone is always coming out with fresh choreography or a new and innovative way to exercise.  This dvd does not have one of those workouts.  I would say the only good thing about this DVD is the workout options (1 star).
The workouts are lacking in creativity...the cardio kickboxing workout was basically a few combinations of punches, kicks and shuffling, and lots of hopping and jumping jacks.  The cardio bootcamp, while physically intense, felt like a long series of running and jumping movements.
The camera angles were poorly chosen.  There were several instances when the instructor would cue some sort of leg work and the camera would be focused on her upper body instead. Sometimes the camera would jump with the instructor, which was hard to watch.
The instructor's form was not satisfactory.  Her slow side kicks looked correct while her fast side kicks did not.  She cued participants to raise their heads when bent forward in a lower body stretch--a big fitness no no, a good instructor would focus on maintaining the head in neutral alignment with the spine.  Some of the movement combinations felt awkward.  The instructor's vocal quality and cueing were not too pleasing to the ear, and she does not mirror her audience (an issue that could easily have been fixed by flipping the image during editing).  Some of the movement combinations felt awkward.
As an avid home exerciser, an AFAA certifed group fitness instructor, and the owner of over 60 fitness dvds, I do not recommend this dvd.  For good workouts, check out the following instuctors/series (in no particular order):  Tamilee Webb, Minna Lessig, QuickFix, Christi Taylor, Cathe, Body Bar, and Kathy Smith.",1098662400,10,1728,5.028070175438597
2115145,5,B0002PUDPK,"After having my second baby, I wanted a workout video that would allow me to get in a quick challenging workout at home and shed those baby pounds.  This DVD is incredible, offering tons of options, which is what Im most thrilled about.  I am able to get in my standard 90 minute morning workout by incorporating the strength training and ab routines along with the cardio.  The instructor is very lively without being cheesy or too perky.  Nonetheless Ive recommended the dvd to all my girlfriends.  I've shed 10 pouunds in just a few weeks.",1096934400,3,542,4.604166666666667
2115146,5,B0002PUDPK,"I was very intrigued as to the number of workouts available on the DVD, and how challenging the workouts are and was amazed to have my expectations meet in full and beyond.  I don't think I've ever really purchased a fitness DVD that had so much variety.  My schedule constantly changes, so its hard to always get in a 60 minute workout.  This DVD offers programs that accomodate my flexible schedule and allow you to squeeze a workout in whether for 10, 15, 30, or 60 minutes.  I highly recommend this and the instructor who keep the workouts fun and challengining.",1096243200,7,566,4.574257425742574
2115147,5,B0002PUDPK,"I bought this and the Ultimate Body Beginning workouts for Weight Loss at the same time. Like the beginning one. this DVD has so much on it, more than I would ever want from a fitness DVD. It has so many workouts to choose from and I can select the workout for how I feel any given day and how much time I have. I must say I am addicted to these DVDs. I do this DVD or the Beginning DVD nearly every day. The instructor's personality is 'up' but not too much and she is funny and relaxed. This is a must have DVD for anyone wanting to get into shape. I use this DVD more than the beginning one",1092873600,7,593,3.909090909090909
2115148,5,B0002PUDPK,I love this DVD. This is already one I will go back to all the time. The instructor's voice is a little annoying like she is trying to hard but if you get past that this is an excellent DVD. I love the cardio sections more than anything they really give you a good sweat. Worth the money!,1140048000,9,288,3.9827586206896552
2115149,4,B0002PUDPK,"Challenging workouts, multiple options and various time intervals , and you can't go wrong.  The instruction is precise, steady, and careful, with strict attention to form and intensity.",1139011200,3,186,5.642857142857143
2115150,5,B0002PUDPK,"The content was superb making for a great effective simple workout, and the instruction was much more elaborate than anticipated, but that enhanced the workouts rather than take anything away.  Meghan makes the workouts fun and challenging.

The navigation is a bit tricky, but I never really get too much into that stuff anyway.  If you want to sweat and loose weight then this would work.",1132012800,4,390,4.878787878787879
2115151,5,B0002PUDPK,"I'm not an aerobics class fan or gym rat. I enjoy running and walking for my cardio and for 2 yrs I trained in karate and kickboxing 4 times a week.  This is one of the few non-Pilates workouts I've ever purchased and the ONLY ONE that I actually use!  It is just awesome!  There are no silly dance steps or crazy choreography. The workouts are straight-forward, effective heart-pumping, fat burning, butt and ab toning sessions.  The kickboxing is similar to a cardio box class that you'd get at a fitness club.  If you have them, put on your boxing gloves for a little added difficulty and to get you feeling strong.

If you don't like bootcamp of kickbox workouts, this DVD is worth the price for the ""Strength Training"" session alone.  The 12 min upper body weight workout had my toned like nothing has, and the lower body (squats, lunges and plyometric)and short ab sessions (10 min) are also fantastic.  Some days I'll just do the upper body and the lower body strength sessions, or if I can get out for a run I'll do the abs after.

Winter is coming.  Don't spend it on the couch.  GET THIS PROGRAM NOW!!!!!",1129593600,20,1114,4.465346534653466
2115152,5,B0002PUDPK,"My schedule has recently changed and I can't get in my usual runs and bike rides.  I'm not a fan of cardio classes so I didn't have any great expectations for this DVD but I LOVE IT!  My favorite cardios on it are the longer kickboxings.  They're like a cardio boxing class and you don't need to have any gloves or bags or anything.  It really gets your heart rate up and with the arm work and squats and stuff it does give you a great full-body workout.

This is my second bodywisdom media disc.  I like to combine some of the routines on their DVDs that I have to a make up my own workouts for whatever I feel like doing.  I have the Pilates Weight Loss one and like to do a 25 minute Intermediate Pilates and then the Upper Body Strength training from Ultimate Body.  I do the bootcamp and kickboxing cardios sometimes but I'm more hooked on the strength training section, especially the upper body and the all the abs.

I've had this DVD for 4 months and use it about 3 times a week.  I've never had a DVD that offers me so much variety and flexibility.  It's so cool!  If all I want to do is work on my legs, I can do that.  If I just want abs, I can do that.  If I want a 45 minute complete cardio class it has that too.  If I feel really tough I do a bootcamp and then after a short break I'll do a additional 10 minute ab workout.",1127606400,11,1338,3.9962264150943394
2115153,1,B0002PUDPK,"At the time I bought this video all of the reviews were 5 stars.  I am pleased to see that Amazon is finally posting the negative feedback and only wish they had when I read the reviews so I could have saved $20.  I am an avid home workout person for about 15 years now and this is the worst DVD I have ever purchased.  The instructor is horrible cueing, her execution is bad and the voice - like nails on a chalkboard.  The worst production ever.  Like another negative review, I thought I was going to throw up watching the screen bounce around in an attempt to film her jumping up and down.  There are so many wonderful DVD's out there - buy some of Janis Saffell's, Karen Voight, Denise Austin or Ellen Barrett's.  You will be glad you did.",1127520000,13,744,4.23404255319149
2115154,5,B0002PUDPK,"This DVD will make you sweat! I like the variety and intensity of the cardio workouts. There are 4 options for cardio: 2 options for Cardio Kickboxing and 2 options for Cardio Bootcamp (sports drills and calisthenics). The cardio has basic and athletic choreography that is more high impact but easily modifiable to be less intense. It's really challenging. The strength training has 5 options: Upper Body, Lower Body, Total Body Strength and Total Body Abs. There are few negatives in this DVD: 1. Meghan's high pitched voice (which only happens on certain instances and not really annoying to me) AND Meghan doesn't mirror cue - i.e. if she says ""right"" it means HER right etc. (not a big deal to me since her movements are basic anyway so it's easy to follow).

Despite the few negatives, I am very pleased with this DVD and see myself doing this on a regular basis. Definitely a great buy!",1119830400,15,893,4.687898089171974
2115155,5,B0002PUDPK,This is a great DVD and it does make you sweat. I am an intermediate/low advanced  exerciser. You can combine segments for a 1 hr even a 1-1/2 hr workout and I am sure you will definitely sweat! Most of the cardio workouts are high impact so it's impossible not to be challenged unless you are a very advanced exerciser. The moves are basic and athletic so anyone can easily follow her. This DVD is worth it!,1118966400,7,408,4.298701298701299
2115156,5,B0002PUDPK,"I love this interactive DVD because of the simplicity and effectiveness of the workouts. As already mentioned you have the choice to do two 20 minute kickboxing segments and two 25 minute cardio bootcamp segments. You can mix and match this however you please. The workouts will really make you sweat despite the simple and athletic moves, most of which are pretty high impact! The only negative thing about the DVD is that the instructor has a rather high pitched voice but only on certain instances. You can just easily turn down the volume and play your own music - the steps/moves are very basic anyway. On the whole, this DVD is very effective and worth it. I'm happy with my purchase.",1115942400,5,690,4.663934426229508
2115157,4,B0002PUDPK,"Overall, I like this DVD a lot, but I do have some complaints and cautions.  First, the positives:

1.  The title lives up to its name--it's probably the most difficult cross-circuit DVD I've done, definitely not for beginners.  (There are no modified versions of the more strenuous bits.)

2.  It's a real bargain.  Unlike many exercise DVDs, this one has a lot of routine.  Two 20-minute kickboxing routines, with their own warm-up, cool-down and abs section, and two 25-minute cardio boot camp routines, with their own warm-up, cool-down and abs section.  You can mix and match as you please.  I like that each abs routine is tailored for the cardio routine it accompanies.

3.  Timely cuing by Meghan.

4.  Good variety of moves within each routine.  The cardio boot camp routines use a mix of jumping, hopping, squats and running in place.  I didn't find any of the routines excessively hard on the knees.

The negatives:

1.  Backward directionals.  I've done a number of exercise videos over the years and have never encountered an instructor who directs you to move left, while she appears (to the watcher) to be moving right.  After a while, you get used to it, but it can be confusing at first.

2.  Bad camera work and editing.  Occasionally the camera focuses on Meghan's upper body when it should be showing you what her legs are doing.

3.  Irritating voice.  Meghan's voice is high-pitched, and the sound quality only accentuates its thinness.  On the plus side, she doesn't have any annoying mannerisms, like saying the same phrase over and over, and she doesn't ""cheer-lead"" too much.

4.  Occasionally the pace of the routine gets so fast it becomes difficult to maintain good form.  In the second boot camp routine, one of the background exercisers uses a step for some of the moves.  Because of the fast pace, she half-stumbles a couple of times, and it looks to me like the chance of injury using the step (which I've never tried) would be high, unless you're an experienced ""stepper.""

5.  Limited instructions for the kickboxing moves.  If you've never done any kickboxing, you may have trouble getting the proper form down, especially for the side kick.  Other videos (Kathy Smith and Total Workout) offer better instruction for kickboxing.

6.  Production values, including music, are less than stellar.",1115596800,39,2328,4.874358974358974
2115158,5,B0002PUDPK,"I picked this DVD up after catching the review in Weight Watchers Magazine.  I've only used it a few weeks, but I have to applaud Meghan on a superb DVD with lots of kick-ass routines that have me feeling toned already. I love the abs routine.",1114387200,6,243,4.282608695652174
2115159,5,B0002PUDPK,"I am so proud to say that I know this girl!!  She encouraged me while working out at her gym, to try her dvd.  I bought it and it was AWESOME!!!  If you like hard fast paced, heart pumping cardio, this is the tape for you!!!  YOu have so much variety, so much to choose from.  The ab work if great because it is simple basic moves done in a way that burn and that lets you know you are doing something right.  Even in the Cardio Boot Camp, you are working the abs  as you move!  For me, this dvd, offers a complete satisfying workout.  Again, it is easy simple movements that are easy to follow, it is amazing that she was able to arrange it so that something so easy can really get you going.  I like the fact that after doing a workout session, I feel like I worked out, her bubbly fun attitiude and cute voice really keeps you smiling the whole work out.  She is as sweet and fun in person just like on tape.  I encourage all who are looking for weight loss to get her dvd!!!",1111104000,12,978,4.010362694300518
2115160,3,B0002PUDPK,"This workout had alot of potential, until hearing the instructor's whiny, high pitched voice.

The workout itself was okay, I just couoldn't listen to the instructor!",1109548800,6,271,5.136363636363637
2115161,5,B0002PUDPK,"No kidding aside, I picked up a copy of the DVD after catching the review in Redbook. They hit the nail on the head.  This DVD helped jump start my new fitness routine.  I loved the interactive capabilities, and being able to create your own programs.  Losing fat is all about mixing diet with sensible exercise and this DVD does just that.  I dropped 7 pounds of FAT in 6 weeks.",1109030400,7,379,4.295774647887324
2115162,5,B0002PUDPK,"Impressive for the amount of workouts available but even more so for the how you can adjust or create workouts to fit your time restraints.  Of the workouts I've used thus far all are very challenging and get my heart racing.

2115163,5,B0002PUDPK,"I am very anal about workout videos as I basically use them more to supplement my workout than to replace fitness training at the gym. I was really impressed with the capabilities especially the level on user control, which I have not seen on any other videos.  I loved the fact that you just jump right into the workouts after a brief explanation from the instructor, and overall its like having your own personal trainer at my immediate disposal.  The ab workouts are not for the weak at heart either. Overall I love it.",1106179200,4,522,4.542553191489362

2115165,4,B0002PUDPK,I have enjoyed all of the segments of this video.  The bootcamp and kickboxing parts are a great cardio workout and really get your heart rate up.  The weights segment is a quick (30 min) but effective workout.  There is also an option to do a 25 minute abs segment as well.  I'm pretty picky when it comes to workout videos but this one is great!,1103760000,,347,4.212121212121212

I have so much fun doing this tape that I look forward to doing it again the next day.  I'm seeing a difference after just 1 week!!  Having this tape is like having a real personal trainer at your finger tips.  I'm thrilled that me search is over!  I found the perfect workout tape.  Take it from me, you won't be sorry!!!!!!!!",1103673600,10,494,4.147368421052631
2115167,4,B0002PUDPK,"Nice video.  The instruction was pretty simple and could be a bit tighter, but I was more concerned with workout intensity and whether or not it got my heart racing.  The video not only did that but offered several different optional workouts to chose from  which targeted various bodyparts which in my case was hips and thighs and/or offered several different timed workouts thatwere great for days when I do not have a great deal of time to exercise and none the less want to think too much about devising a program shorter than my normal routine.

The instructor looked great and offered up some helpful fitness and diet tips on the video.  Id say I was pretty happy with the video and recommend for those looking for something different but produces results.",1102464000,3,762,4.6992481203007515
2115168,5,B0002PUDPK,"The full-body workout routines got me sweating and I'd consider myself to be in good shape.  This is a good program that includes a a variety of routines (kickboxing, bootcamp, strength, abs) with warm ups, cardio, mat work and a cool down, along with helpful tips on how to train (For example, the instructor reminds you to drink plenty of water and to stretch on your own.)

I noticed some reviewers mentioned an issue regarding the instructor's left and right, but this happens in other fitness DVDs I have used.  Some instructor's left being your right and vice versa.  Others do their left being your left.  And I guess people have different preferences, so that part is up to you.  Since she works out both sides, and I have seen DVDs done both ways, to me it was not an issue.

So basically if you are looking for a great workout and a great deal, get this DVD.",1101859200,5,868,4.455696202531645

It's a good bargain for the price, but the instructor does not realize that her right is our left and often she is out of sync with the other two exercisers in the video.  Also, the form of the guy in the back is, well, sloppy.  If these things won't bother you, I recommend the video.  If you are new to exercise, you might want to try a more reputed instructor, such as Kathy Smith",1101772800,2,484,4.117021276595745
2115170,5,B0002PUDPK,"I've never been the biggest fan of at home videos.  I often find them to be overly blown and not much in terms of substance and quickly outgrow them.  This DVD is the exception, the workouts and rountines are not complicated yet challenging and I could pick and choose what programs I wanted to do on any given day.  The instructor seemed to have a grasp of fitness knowledge with translates during the workout routines.  Pretty much Id say you can't find a better value eslewhere.",1100822400,4,481,4.558139534883721
2115171,1,B0002PUDPK,"I actually watched all the workouts on this DVD and had to ask myself why I paid my hard earned money for it.

Right away I noticed the instructor's voice.  It gets annoyingly higher in pitch when she counts down or approaches the end of a sentence (Four! ThReE!! TWO!!!).  Then there were the viewing angles, there was so much bouncing I wanted to throw up.  And sometimes the instructor would be doing a lower body focused movement, but the view only showed her hips and higher.  So useless!  It's already been mentioned, but it needs to be mentioned again, the instructor doesn't mirror the audience which gives the video a very unprofessional look.

During the workouts I felt totally unmotivated.  Tae Bo might have simple moves, but at least Billy Blanks motivates participants through the workout.  The cardio workouts (Boot Camp and Kickbox) were so boring I felt like I could do a better job making up my own workout to music with a good beat.

Most of the cardio moves are hi-impact with basic and athletic moves like jogging, jumping jacks, hops, shuffles, fast feet, kickboxing etc. Some people comment about cueing problems but I didn't notice any at all or maybe because the moves are very basic, I  didn't have problem doing the workout. There is no complex choreography in this workout at all. I also like the set because it's nice and simple.

Boy was I sorry I spent the twenty dollars plus shipping and handling on this one.  It is terrible.  The set is horrible, the instructor has a mousy voice that is barely audible and the man who works out behind her looks like he is tired and just wants to lay down and take a nap! The instructor looks awkward when throwing punches, all the moves are so boring, and the music is even worse. Save your money, if you want a really great aerobic workout with kickboxing moves go for the Tae-Bo tapes, or Kathy Smith's kickboxing video, they have motivating instructors, great music, and visually appealing workout sets.",1099699200,6,741,4.507462686567164

I felt like I was working out backwards half the time because the instructor signaled right/left movements according to her right/left and not the viewers.  The music was good on some of the workouts and awful on the others.  I didn't like it and think there are way better workout dvds to follow.",1099612800,3,416,4.671232876712328
2115177,5,B0002PUDPK,"I recently picked this up after reading a review in the LA Times. The times boasted that the DVDs offered lots of variety much more than other videos on the market and Id have to agree.  Lots of kickboxing, weight training and ab work which I just love to work with my Pilates training.  I'd also recommend Pilates Complete for Weight Loss.",1099526400,3,340,4.467741935483871
8030554,2,B0002PUDPK,It was a repeat of a video that I already have.,1417132800,2,47,3.3636363636363638
8030555,5,B0002PUDPK,"I have always really liked this DVD.  I love choosing between the cardio, strength, or kickboxing.  I also enjoy that she has the abs secions separate so that I can add them after another DVD if I desire and don't have to fast forward through the whole workout just for abs.  I have used it for years, off and on.  I like her as a trainer.  She has the right balance of being ""annoyingly happy"" and motivating at the same time.  I wish she would do more videos!",1398124800,,461,4.181818181818182
8030556,2,B0002PUDPK,This was filmed in a very dark studio with people who don't know the routines. Very basic moves with little direction. The instructor seems to be getting cues from behind the camera and then remembers to change the routine. She seems a little surprised to find herself leading a workout video and will suddenly scream out. I only keep it around for abs when my workout doesn't include my core.,1235347200,2,393,4.628571428571429
8030557,5,B0002PUDPK,"This is the aerobics DVD I always go back to.  It offers a several realistic workouts, ones that I can get through and feel as though I've worked hard.  She doesn't coy her audience, but rather treats it with respect, as though they are a group that is used to working out.  She manages to be encouraging at the same time!  This is well worth the money.  I hope BodyWisdommedia comes out with more DVDs like this one.",1200528000,,417,4.294871794871795
8030558,5,B0002PUDPK,"The instructor is down to earth, encouraging, optimistic, and I love the workouts. They are challenging at first for a beginner, it IS bootcamp, I highly reccomend this DVD, as it has 9 half hour workouts to choose from, and 3 differnt kind of abs workouts, Get this DVD if you want variety! I live on doing something different everday! Megan also has an uplifting smile that is very warm, which in itself is very encouraging to work out to everyday.",1198281600,2,450,4.567901234567901
8030559,5,B0002PUDPK,"This is my go-to-workout.  I started out using the Self and Shape DVDs, plus bellydance.  As I've gotten stronger, though, I've started doing this video more.  And when I'm short on time (who isn't?!), this gets me moving and breaking a sweat - FAST!!
Meghan White's Ultimate Body Workout is my 'kick-my-butt-in-gear-and-get-it-moving' choice.  This has it all - four different types of cardio, all sorts of strength routines - upper, lower and three different ABS routines.
Be warned though - it is not for beginners.  I worked up to doing this over a period of three months. I figure in another four to six weeks I'll be ready to do one of the 'full' 45 minute workouts.  It is high impact and if you have knee or back problems, this might not be for you - Meghan likes lots of jumping jacks, running in place and ski jumps.  Check with your doctor.",1184284800,2,851,4.559210526315789
8030560,3,B0002PUDPK,"I agree with the reviewers about that squeaky awful voice.  I tried this video and could barely get a few minutes into it before it drove me up the wall.  If you can get past the voice, then this looks like a nice workout with good variety, but I just couldn't take it.  I almost gave this DVD one star but figured that was unfair based only on the voice.  I like a calmer (but still encouraging) instructor like Cathe Friedrich, Ellen Barrett, or Jari Love.",1179273600,3,458,4.290697674418604
8030561,5,B0002PUDPK,"There are a lot of workout videos that I don't like because they don't hold my attention for long.  I really like this DVD because there are 4 different workout programs that you can do.  The variety is perfect for decreaseing boredom.  Some reviewers have mentioned Meagan's annoying voice, but I don't think it's that bad.",1163116800,5,324,4.75
8030562,4,B0002PUDPK,"I love this workout!  The instructor, Meghan White, just makes me want to laugh because she is so exuberant and into the workout.  When she gets really excited, her voice goes all high and squeaky.  It could be seen as annoying, but I'm just amused and enjoy the workout even more.  I've only done the two 25-minute bootcamp workouts, the 45-minute bootcamp workout, and the upper body strength training.  I could do workouts from this DVD every day.  You'll be sweating a lot, you really feel like you're working, and it's a lot of fun.  I love having the option of a shorter cardio (25 min) or a longer one (45 min) complete with abs workout.",1159056000,6,644,4.5
8030563,4,B0002PUDPK,"I enjoy this DVD because it lets me pick the workout routine I want.  I use this DVD to supplement my existing cardio workout with the quick strength training sections.  The upper and lower body strength training sections are easy to follow, but challenging enough to give me a good workout.

I have not tried the Boot Camp portions of the DVD, but enjoyed the Kickboxing workout.

I wouldn't use this as my primary workout, but for the price and variety, it is worth the low price.",1152057600,6,482,4.505747126436781
