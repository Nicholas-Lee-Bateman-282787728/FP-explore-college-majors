One cheap, disgusting scene after another...No one can watch this film without suffering at least some indigestion....""When one uses an obscenity, they stop Saying something and Become something..They take attention off their Thoughts and put it on their Words....I saw a lot of potential talent acting in a theatricl gutter..",1219017600,,678,5.172727272727273

VERY dark, and I don't think that part of the movie was meant to be funny.  It just made me uncomfortable.  This is not a good comedy.  Be forwarned.",1191801600,,319,4.526315789473684

2792435,2,B000O7861O,"Wow, from what it looks like, so far I am in the minority, but this film was bad. Very bad. Sorry Fred Savage, this is no wonder, and it makes me think you should have packed it away years ago.  I do sincerely like Fred savage, he is a decent actor, but wow, horrible film.  Just dumb.  Yeah, break-ups are hard, but gez man, have some confidence and self esteem.  And the Ending...What the heck, she gave him a chance again....come on, seriously, is her self esteem that low that she thinks she can get no one else.  Wow.  Disfunction at it's finest.  Eject the brain on this one, I just can't be dumb enough to like it.  Thank goodness I rented this one...everyone else should avoid it.

2792436,5,B000O7861O,"I heard about this film, and now that I've finally seen it, ""The Last Run"" is better than I even imagined. I saw ""Knocked Up"" with my girlfriend the day it opened and thought that was the funniest film I'd seen in a while. But ""The Last Run"" was even funnier! Fred Savage is in rare top-notch form, Steven Pasquale is ten times better than Paul Rudd, and Amy Adams has never looked better. ""The Last Run"" is smart and edgy, the writing is incredibly sharp, the directing is captivating and well honed (I particularly like how the evolution of Savage's sexual beast, rousing from flickers of addiction into full-scale personification, is teased out over the course of the first two thirds until ultimately reaching a well earned boiling point). This is a film that should have been released on 3000 screens and grossed $100 million. I'm going to watch it again and again because there are so many lines that are sure to become classics. I hope that this film gives Fred Savage a whole new career because his talents as a comedic actor have been overlooked. Whatever films you see this summer, make sure ""The Last Run"" is on your list.",1182988800,5,1133,4.586206896551724
2792437,5,B000O7861O,"I saw a screening of this a little while back at a film festival mainly because I'm a huge Wonder Years fan. This movie is absolutely hilarious.

The basic premise is Fred Savage finds out his girlfriend of several years is cheating on him so his best friend tells him to go have sex with as many women as he can to get over her. This movie is very funny, but not stupid humor, there are some really smart moments in it. Plus there are tons of really hot women in it, which is always a good thing.

Every guy in the audience will find themselves nodding as Steve (Savage) goes through many of the same situations that you have also whether it be being dumped, shutdown by a girl at a bar, or just hate your job and your boss. I rarely write movie reviews on here because so many people do but this movie might get missed and I think its an instant classic in the making.",1180656000,5,870,4.1420118343195265
8183799,4,B000O7861O,Fred Savage  shows how well he does comedy in this movie,1441497600,,56,4.090909090909091
8183800,5,B000O7861O,"A friend from the Chicago cult cinema scene, as it were, held a viewing party for this, and I had to go out and get my own copy immediately.  Like The Room, this was released in the early 2000s to absolutely zero acclaim--from critics or otherwise--only to start getting recognition from connoisseurs years down the road (though as compared to The Room, which is likely the biggest cult hit since Rocky Horror, The Last Run remains decidedly underground).  Starring Fred Savage, the film was ostensibly supposed to be some kind of macho-yet-feel-good-flick for the yah brah set, but something went wrong along the way.  Horribly wrong.

In short, the film bills itself as the story of one office workers last run of debauchery and hook-ups to exact revenge on his ex, but in fact leads the viewer through a rampage of compulsive encounters with sex workers from all corners of the industry.  In short, it feels less like a last run and more like Leaving Las Vegas for sex addicts, as Fred Savage loses his job due to his inability to do anything at work other than surf the web for yet more high-priced escorts, sometimes paying thousands of dollars for a single fling.

As surreal as it is highly recommended.

Mr Savage carries his Wonder Years label still and is not a hot enough guy for this role.",1354147200,,125,3.8461538461538463
8183803,2,B000O7861O,"I like Fred Savage.  I grew up with the Wonder Years and could relate to Fred's character and his many aggravating family and school issues, but then again, it's the kind of show that is probably relatable to *most* teenage boys.  Simply put- Fred Savage was a terrific actor for that show, not to mention a perfect choice for lead role.

In the Last Run, he unfortunately proves that he isn't good enough for a main role in a movie.

The storyline is obviously the worst part.  It's about a foulmouthed Fred Savage having constant desires to attend adult nightclubs so he can try to impress the ladies with his mannerisms, and supposedly this qualifies as humor but I sure as heck didn't find anything about his character remotely funny.

I'm just surprised that such a lousy plot was considered good enough to actually make a movie out of it.  I definitely sensed a low budget vibe while watching the film, in both the acting and storyline.

I guess Fred wanted to prove to the world that he's finally become an adult with the ability to attract women in a way that I definitely consider inappropriate what with all the swear words being tossed around (though actually his friends are more to blame than he is in this regard).  Basically Fred Savage's character is that of a sleazeball.  He wants to be in a relationship sure, but he's more concerned with scoring and showing disrespect towards women above everything else.

He's not right for such a storyline but then again, nobody else would be a quality choice for such a low budget film either.

The Last Run is just a terrible film that should be avoided at all costs.",1303948800,,1626,4.588235294117647
8183804,5,B000O7861O,"This reminded me of growing up in Las Vegas. The Last Run is a really good movie for any guy who loves a good story with lots of T & A. The montage of Fred getting ripped up and trying to F anything that walks is classic. ""I quit my job but have been working out. Check out my arm its like a F'n pipe bomb!"" This movie flys by and it rocks. See Fred at his finest in this little indie. If it had the budget for better music it would have been a Cult Classic so I just suggest owning it. My scale is dd Don't Doit, WW Worth Watching, MM Mustc Movie and CC Cult Classic. This is a definite MM but as I stated with better music it would be vaulted to CC status. All real big city men need to watch this flick. The wonder years to a David Duchovny sex maniac.",1303344000,3,755,3.8152866242038215
8183805,1,B000O7861O,"This film is as bad as films get.  What happened to that sweet kid who used to be on TV?  In any case, it looks like this film was pretty much the end of Fred Savage's film career.  Amazing that Amy Adams would be found in a film this bad.",1299628800,,239,3.74

Enid: This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again.

If the Mitchell Brothers were looking for a sure-fire tax loss they might have cranked out a movie like ""The Last Run"" (2004).  They would have taken perverse amusement from plugging a has-been child-star into a grind-house level comedy.  Fred Savage was always more narrator than actor and the movie's voiceover commentary probably seemed like a good fit.

Unfortunately the script is moronic even by Mitchell Brothers standards and there are no likely ""Ivory Snow"" mothers in the cast; the women in this movie look like aging escort service girls lured out of a local AA meeting or bowling alley.  You know these marginal actresses are high mileage because the script calls for the male characters to incessantly discuss how young and beautiful they are.

It does have a pre-""Enchanted"" (and then unknown) Amy Adams in the cast.  You mostly know this because she gets top billing on the 2007 promotional poster and DVD package (a marketing thing); although she is only in about 10% of the footage, and even then as secondary player in the scenes.  During her brief appearances she is responsible for the films only funny moments; not because of what she says but because of the way she says it.  She has enough natural comedic talent to make something out of nothing even in a crash-and-burn turkey like ""The Last Run"".  Unless you absolutely have to see everything Adams has appeared in, there is no reason to seek out this DVD.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1281398400,5,1587,4.6859205776173285
8183807,2,B000O7861O,"I bought this title as I liked the concept and thought it had the potential to be made into a good movie. However I was dissapointed.

8183808,4,B000O7861O,"Fred Savage, the child actor from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wonder-Years/dp/B00005JMN7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wonder Years</a>&nbsp;is now all grown up.  Like so many child actors, he needs a way to shed his goodie-two-shoes image that he acquired as a kid actor.  Enter THE LAST RUN.

Fred plays a young man who is on top of the world early in the film.  He is head-over-heels in love with the girl of his dreams (Amy Adams).  Just one problem:  his girlfriend is a ""high roller"" and a player, and she's already phasing him out of her life as soon as the opening credits are over.  Uh oh!  {As a sidenote, I don't know if Amy Adams could fill the bill as every man's fantasy, but she SURE does equal what I'd call a dreamgirl!}

The inevitable break-up sends the poor guy into a tailspin.  Actually, that's an understatement.  Losing her TOTALLY wrecks his life.  (On a biographical note, I can certainly relate to this!).  The combination of getting dumped by the woman he wanted to someday marry + some very bad advice from his best friend leads to a perfect storm of bad decisions.

His friend tells him to rebound by going on a string of meaningless one-night-stands.  He follows these instructions, but they end up costing him just about everything - both financially as well as emotionally.

He starts spending thousands on high-priced escort girls & strippers.  It ends up costing him his job as he simply can't function anymore.  He gets to the point where he is addicted to having sex, and he actually  ends up using sex as a sort of weapon against women.  No, that's not to say he becomes a rapist.  Rather, it's the domination (i.e.:  being in control of the situation) that becomes the end-all for him.

While the basic plot outline of this film sounds like material for a Romantic comedy, this is not a film that  I would categorize as an RC movie.  To be sure, there are a few funny parts (including a hilarious allusion to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator/dp/B000OPOAM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator</a>), but the overall timbre of the movie is surprisingly dark.

If you're looking for a drama with a few humorous lines and a pretty good amount of gratuitous nudity, then this is a film worth checking out.  If you're gunning for a straight RC, I'd advise that you look elsewhere.  This is NOT what I'd call a ""date movie!""",1242691200,,2470,5.092269326683292
