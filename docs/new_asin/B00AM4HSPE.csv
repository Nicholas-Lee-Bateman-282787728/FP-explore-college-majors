5450319,5,B00AM4HSPE,"Watched this with my 8 year old daughter.  I know that I may never meet Glenn in person, but this special is a perfect example of why I consider him part of my family.

I enjoyed being welcomed in to his home, and his family was wonderful.  They shared their home, their stories, their Hot Chocolate ( The recipe at least ), and then treated us to beautiful Christmas music and a play produced by their 8 year old child.

I wish I could give this 6 stars.  It is one of the few christmas specials that focuses more on Jesus and love than presents and parties.",1355529600,16,559,4.186915887850467
5450320,5,B00AM4HSPE,"When we sat down to watch the show, I was a little skeptical about what I was going to see. Then I was completely blown away by the awesome power of music, wonderful stories, family togetherness, and especially the true story of Christmas. This was a powerful show that lifts spirits and gives hope. We loved it much that we ordered DVDs for us and our families.",1355443200,17,362,4.417910447761194
5450321,5,B00AM4HSPE,"This was an excellent Christmas special. Everything from Glenn's personal stories, the interaction with his family, the music, and the live production of the Christmas Story (Birth of Christ, not the BB gun) was exactly what Christmas should represent. I watched it on The BlazeTV, but I will own this DVD soon. I also recommend Glenn Beck's Christmas Tour DVD.",1355443200,16,361,5.033333333333333
5450322,5,B00AM4HSPE,A wonderful presentation with music and a chance to see family and friends in Glenn's home setting. Make's us feel like we are there in his living room enjoying the inspiration and celebration of Christmas. This makes a memorable Christmas event. Well done.,1355356800,17,257,5.0
5450323,5,B00AM4HSPE,This was one of the best Christmas specials I have seen in a long long time.  Thank you Glen Beck for sharing these precious moments with us. I can't wait to share it with my family.,1355356800,25,182,4.055555555555555
5450324,5,B00AM4HSPE,"What a wonderful night of television! So personal! It reminded me of shows back in the fifties, when you felt like you were a part of their family. The true meaning of Christmas, finally!",1355356800,28,187,4.529411764705882
5450325,5,B00AM4HSPE,I love the return to family values.  I watched this with my wife and felt like I did when I was a child.  I really miss programming that returns you to a better time.,1355356800,24,166,3.8529411764705883
5450326,3,B00AM4HSPE,"I loved the music and the stories and the nativity put on by Glenn's son but alot of the background stories weren't that interesting. I did like the interviews with employees about their best Christmas memories.  I guess I just expected a ""Family Christmas Program"" to be different.",1358294400,,282,4.875
5450327,5,B00AM4HSPE,"An inspiring, entertaining reminder of the true meaning of Christmas. Glenn has a way of touching hearts through his sincerity and commitment to truth.",1358294400,,151,5.333333333333333
5450328,5,B00AM4HSPE,Anyone that wouldn't enjoy this just plain old doesn't have any Christmas spirit.  It's just a down home personal experience.  He brings you into his home and shares with you like people who know him can appreciate.  Then the children put on an addorable play that would touch anyones heart.  He gets a lot of bad press but people need to judge for themselves what a softhearted loving family man he is and it sure comes through in this special.  The music is beautiful throughout!,1358208000,,481,4.6117647058823525
5450329,5,B00AM4HSPE,The best Christmas feelings for family and friends.  Brought back what Christmas is all about!  I would definitely recommend this DVD.,1358208000,,134,5.333333333333333
5450330,5,B00AM4HSPE,This is a classic to be watched at least each Christmas. Music awesome & can be ordered separately. Production of nativity by two 8 year olds most memorable I've seen.,1358121600,,167,4.6
5450331,4,B00AM4HSPE,I don't like Glenn Beck but I caught his Christmas special at one of my family member's house over Christmas. It was pretty good! I would recommend it!,1357862400,,151,4.428571428571429
5450332,5,B00AM4HSPE,I recieved this on the day it was supposed to be delivered. It is an excellent DVD with some added extra's I was not expecting but was a really nice surprise! Im very happy with this DVD and the way Amazon handled the order! I highly recommend it to my friends and family!,1357776000,,272,4.150943396226415
5450333,5,B00AM4HSPE,"If you long for an old fashioned Christmas program, I think you will enjoy Glenn Beck's Family Christmas.  There is no glitz, just a sweet  Christmas program with wonderful music and a precious children's Christmas play.",1357689600,,220,5.083333333333333
5450334,5,B00AM4HSPE,A beautiful Christmas keepsake. Sent two copies to friends. The music was exceptional. Christmas with Christ in it. How refreshing!,1357257600,4,131,5.6
5450335,5,B00AM4HSPE,"I was almost sure I would buy this video, but after reading the bad reviews, there was NO question.  I HAD to buy it.  The so-called reviews by the Neanderthals were all I needed.  Some people just CAN'T stand it that some people have different ideas and VALUES than they have. They feel threatened and scared that others have BETTER VALUES, and even though they say they are open minded and tolerant.....  REALLY...????",1356825600,8,420,4.712328767123288
5450336,5,B00AM4HSPE,"I think folks who clearly have not listened to what Glenn has had to say over the past few years commenting on this item is a bit pathetic. He speaks truth. He uses the very words of the people he is talking about to make his case. Is he perfect? Nope. Does he say things I disagree with? Yes. Has he made predictions and pointed out possibilities that turned out to be spot on?  Yep, and i guess that is what makes those who wish to cling to their normalcy bias so angry. So, just understand that there are folks out there who just love to spread the hate & obviously have a bit too much time on their hands so they troll conservative writers to express their hatred. Sad.",1356480000,3,673,4.176923076923077
5450337,1,B00AM4HSPE,"Being shown non-stop on Dish Network. If you must have it; get a friend w/ Dish to burn you a copy. EASTER EGG: See if you can catch Glenn's trophy wife blinking out ""SOS"" in morse code! Fun for all! MORMONS ONLY!",1356307200,2,213,4.095238095238095
5450338,1,B00AM4HSPE,"I wouldn't have this guys stuff in my house, not on a bet! He's a whacko and has a following of whackos (whackoes?)",1356307200,3,115,4.043478260869565
5450339,1,B00AM4HSPE,"Wow! What a LOON! I suppose if you are a fan of his, you'll like this. But it's a supreme waste of time and your money~",1356307200,4,119,3.6153846153846154
5450340,1,B00AM4HSPE,"There's a reason why it's ""produce on demand"" because Beck knows its only for his die-hard ""followers"" who believe in his cult (and yes, he is a cult figure). Do not waste your money on this, you'll just be supporting him in his crusade to help destroy real American values with his madness.",1356307200,6,291,4.509433962264151
5450341,1,B00AM4HSPE,"This DVD program is an example of how the haters of America will do anything to get
you to forget the damage they have done in destroying the potential for civil
discourse in addressing our beloved country's challenges.  Here, Glenn Beck makes
an attempt to soften his image by using his family as a buffer to his own reality.
This guy is a fake, a phony and a fraud.  His type of paranoia is riddled with
contempt for anyone who disagrees with him.  A man who is bound to think
negatively by his sheer nature is not to be trusted.",1356307200,6,531,4.29
5450342,1,B00AM4HSPE,"That gentle blend of racism, misogyny, and ignorance we all remember from the 50's. Thank you Glen Beck for giving old people a reason to fear black people again. This DVD is filled with old school Christmas Cheer and enough queer basing to satisfy the whole family.

I give this DVD 5 out of 5 burning lawn crosses.",1356220800,10,316,4.448275862068965
5450343,5,B00AM4HSPE,"It was a great blend of holiday traditions, music (beautiful renditions!) humor and sentiment.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  This man, his family and his employees (as they shared family memories) seem to grasp the true meaning of love and compassion.  Would love to know the total of his charitable donations each year. From the floods in the midwest to Sandy and everything in between, he walks the talk.",1356134400,11,408,4.8
5450344,1,B00AM4HSPE,"I can't think of a worse way to spend Christmas than with the man who bears a great deal of responsibility for the horrible times we've had to endure.  His paranoia, misinformation, and outright lies, all done to fill his own pockets, make him a modern-day Scrooge.  Anyone buying this is supporting a man who is determined to destroy our country.  This DVD turns my stomach.",1356048000,16,375,4.651515151515151
5450345,1,B00AM4HSPE,"Glen Bank is personally responsible for this big heaping pile of crap... this reminds me the video Pleasantville, but that was made to be a form of entertainment not torture.... what's next? Rush Limbaugh's happy Hannukah?.. yuck!!!",1356048000,23,232,5.297297297297297
8553522,5,B00AM4HSPE,This is a great production. It is thoughtful and inspiring and will melt the heart. I good addition to a family Christmas tradition.,1420243200,,132,4.782608695652174
8553523,5,B00AM4HSPE,"I received this on Christmas Eve and watched it that night. The music is wonderful and the Christmas play put on by Glenn's son and his friend was great. It even shows some of the ""making of"" the play which was fun to watch. Glenn shows how a couple Christmas trees were decorated as well as his ""Death by Chocolate"" hot chocolate recipe. The whole show was very enjoyable to watch.",1391904000,,382,4.394366197183099
8553524,5,B00AM4HSPE,"I just watched this special (it's November 11, 2013) ... a little early for Christmas.  It was wonderful.  First, I am NOT a Mormon.  I am a nondenominational, born again, Christian.  It was one of the best Christmas specials I have ever seen in my life, and at age 64, I've seen quite a few of them.

Glenn's story about the gift of the picture of Jesus was ""spiritual"" to say the least !!  The music was beautiful ... I especially loved The First Noel with Michelle Moyer ... and my favorite was Joy to the World by David Osmond.  I would buy the dvd just for his rendition of Joy to the World !!

I didn't see this special last year, but I am so glad I got to see it now.",1384128000,,674,4.015037593984962
8553525,5,B00AM4HSPE,I thought this was a great show for the family to watch. My kids loved his hot chocolate recipe. The story about how he got the picture of the black sheep was moving.,1382572800,,166,4.0606060606060606
8553526,1,B00AM4HSPE,One word describes this  item.....boring.  Should have watched it on TV when I had a chance because I found this a waste of money. Something he tells us not to do.,1365724800,,163,4.225806451612903
8553527,5,B00AM4HSPE,"This was such a moving Christmas Special.  The stories and music were beautiful, and the childrens play at the end was priceless.  A true family Christmas experience.  It will be part of our family tradition for each year to come.",1360972800,,230,4.7
8553528,5,B00AM4HSPE,"Even though we watched the original broadcast & have it recorded on our Dish receiver, we feel so blest to also have the DVD. We thank Glenn, his family, & staff for such an excellent & inspiring family celebration in a true loving family celebration for the birth of our Lord & Saviour, Jesus Christ.  It was as if we were actually guests within their home & the church.  The music IS superb & have all of the songs uploaded on iTunes which I still play occasionally.  They are tremendously talented artists.  The  Nativity scene  tells the Christmas Story which touches ones heart unlike any I've witnessed.  The beautiful & precious children were so moving as from their sweet hearts come the true spirit of Christmas.  Thank you, Director Raphe, for a job very well done!!  Before the program was even shown I was suggesting friends, family, & even strangers to watch.  We were delighted when it came out on DVD & immediately purchased one, but wished I had several.  Right now ours is out on loan.  Yes, I know it is no longer December 25th, but Christmas & Easter are with us daily.  :-)  The rating should be a 5Star +++++",1359936000,,1129,4.524752475247524
8553529,5,B00AM4HSPE,"I plan to show this DVD to people in my church - I love Glenn's telling the story of his providentially obtaining the picture of Jesus and the black sheep.  Plus the skit by Raphe and his friend was reverent, humorous and very well done!",1358812800,,237,4.266666666666667
8553530,5,B00AM4HSPE,It was just as I hoped it would be& more. Glenn has a nice home and family! You will enjoy it!,1358726400,,94,3.5238095238095237
8553531,5,B00AM4HSPE,"Wonderful, warmhearted destined to be watched every Christmas by our family.  Music epic. Children adorable playing out the Christmas story for all in the little church.",1358640000,,169,5.5
