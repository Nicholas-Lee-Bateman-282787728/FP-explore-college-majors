In the U.S., two VHS tapes were released in April 1996: ""Escape from Edenoi"" and ""Super Gold"". Another VHS tape (""Ferbus' First Christmas"") with a bonus episode (""Ferbus Maximus"") was scheduled as well, but cancelled. In the United Kingdom, Maximum Entertainment released one DVD which includes both parts of ""Escape from Edenoi"" and ""License To Thrill"".
The DVDs have not be mentioned yet as Shout! Factory is working on releasing the series sometime in 2014.",1379030400,2,854,4.625
8590224,5,B00D7AM6PC,"The final episodes of this cool Power Rangers-esque series Saban come to DVD hopefully.  At the time of this posting there is word that despite being almost done with the releasing of the show,  the final volume may be cancelled due to poor sales of the prior volumes. I hope not because it would be sad for fans of the show, new and old.

It may not have the 20 year legacy Power Rangers does but it's a great show on its own merit. It would still be on if they didn't run out of stock footage to use for the base. So fans should support it by buying these affordable sets and enjoying them!

Maybe if it does get cancelled it can find a new life on MOD. Either way I will put my money down for it and see the Troopers kick Grimlords butt!",1378512000,5,740,4.0479452054794525
8590225,5,B00D7AM6PC,"I wish Saban would have at least made a movie or movies of V R Troopers so that the show wouldn't have ended in what I call movie & tv heil , also known as a cliffhanger ; and by the way , Shout Factory better change their f.....g minds about canceling V R Troopers season 2 vol 2 because that's even worse than movie & tv heil  / a cliffhanger , that's movie & tv pergatory .",1378339200,7,376,3.8205128205128207
8590226,5,B00D7AM6PC,"Hey All

We Need Everyone Fans Support, like its said, Shout Factory has has stated ""Due to poor sales of the previous volumes the VR Troopers Season 2, Volume 2 release announced for September has been cancelled."" We forwarded this message to our contacts at Shout! Factory, who replied today with confirmation of the bad news: ""Yes, the release has been cancelled. The Amazon page will be removed soon."" In order to get this released I ask every fan to get these other volumes so they can get the last of this show out on DVD.

Thanks",1378166400,14,536,4.515463917525773
