3871708,5,B00284BVC2,"I COULD NOT WAIT TO SEE THIS VIDEO AFTER ALL THE GOOD REVIEWS AND I HAVE TO SAY IT IS WONDERFUL, GREAT CAMERA WORK AND NZ IS SO BEAUTIFUL, MAKES ME WANT TO GO FLYFISHING RIGHT NOW AND TIE ON THAT MOUSE FLY I'VE NEVER USED.",1253664000,,222,3.847826086956522
3871709,5,B00284BVC2,"This is one of those rare films that regardless if you participate in the activity it is promoting or not, you will find something that appeals to you.

You do not have to be an angler to appreciate this film-It is an entertaining, awe inspiring and educational film.

The camera work is top notch and the scenery is mind blowing.

If you enjoy the outdoors at all, to any degree, you must buy this DVD. If you are into photography, biology, botany or, last, but most certainly not least,fishing, you must buy this DVD.

I own many outdoor related, hunting and fishing videos and DVD's and this is the best film of it's kind I have ever seen. Actually, it is in a class by itself. I have never seen a fly fishing film that comes close to the quality of this film.

Two Thumbs up!!!!!",1244160000,10,783,4.335616438356165
3871710,5,B00284BVC2,"Absolutely stunning photography.  It was a real treat to visit some of these special fly fishing locations deep in the south island of New Zealand.  The combination of helicopter views and underwater scenes made it a visual delight.  While I'm not a fisherman I was still able to appreciate the film for its story, scenary and biology lesson.  Definitely a great one to add to a DVD collection.",1243555200,5,394,4.75
3871711,5,B00284BVC2,"This film is in its own league.  I own a lot of Fly Fishing DVDs and they pale in comparison to this great documentary.  Not only do you get to watch one of the top 100 fly casters of the world, Carl McNeil, work his magic, but the cinematography in HD above and below the water is spectacular....really unbelievable.  Add the scientific lesson you get on the feeding behaviors of New Zealand trout and you have a 3 way combo that is a force to be reckoned with.

In the Eastern Sierras, there is legend of the big browns of the Owens River getting fooled on mouse imitations.  Now I can't wait to try it.

I have a new ritual: Watching this film before a fly fishing trip to fire me up.",1243209600,,687,4.166666666666667
3871712,5,B00284BVC2,"Watching this movie was a real treat. Fantastic scenery, Gin clear water and Big Fish. The camera work is fantastic. Somehow in the midst of the amazing fishing and beautiful surroundings they've slipped in a Trout Biology lesson. I was entertained but also informed. Carl's unraveled a puzzle. If you play it backward I swear you can hear ""Come to New Zealand the Trout are so big they eat mice""",1243209600,,396,4.671428571428572
3871713,5,B00284BVC2,"I have seen quite a bit of the current and past offerings in the flyfishing movie genre, this for me has been THE best! stunning scenery from a world heritage area, casting like I cant, and great editing. many hours of footage must have been shot to create this, no overbearing soundtrack or excessively fast scene changes, just quality by the bucket. the factual interviews are woven in well and with relevance. more please!",1243123200,,425,4.756756756756757
3871714,4,B00284BVC2,"This was a very well done documentary. Yes, it had it's fair share of excessive casting & (huge) trout footage, but not the typical ""trout bum"" style of film that's being made these days. I really enjoyed the scientific approach and explanation of the impact of the mice population explosion. The mice evidently not only attract big brown trout, but some very large eels too! The beautiful scenery shot from above (helicopter) & below (underwater camera) make this a worthwhile purchase on their own. I would love nothing more than to fish some of these lakes & streams - the water clarity was amazing. Video is about 45 minutes in length, just about right.",1243036800,4,657,4.771929824561403
3871715,3,B00284BVC2,"My husband and I have been fly-fishing in New Zealand (which was amazing).  I think this movie was lacking a little in action and probably could have used more commentary from the locals (which they usually provide some more humor as well).  Since there are few DVDs out there on fly-fishing, its worth getting if you have all the others.  I think we liked ""trout bum dairies:newzealand"" better.",1354492800,3,395,4.779411764705882
3871716,5,B00284BVC2,"Purchased this as a Christmas gift and it arrived quickly, in great condition, and as advertised.  I has a positive experience with this seller.",1325721600,,144,5.0
3871717,3,B00284BVC2,"The scenery is great.  The photography is great.  The actual fishing time is fairly short.  There isn't really anything in the way of show and tell, how-to, or gear time.  I love to hear people talk about how and why they're doing what they're doing and discuss the gear they're using; none of that here.

If you want pretty pictures and fly-by's ... this is for you.  If you're looking for something like ""Successful Fly Fishing Strategies"" by Lafontaine and Sharron, you'll be disappointed.",1323734400,5,492,4.7976190476190474
3871718,3,B00284BVC2,"From the reviews I read, it was made out to be an amazing, once-in-a-lifetime event.  Don't get me wrong, there is some great cinematography and some amazing browns being caught, but it seemed a bit like the Blair Witch project: a lot promised, but not a lot delivered.  That being said, I still think it is worth watching; maybe just borrow a friend's copy.",1315267200,,358,4.578125
3871719,5,B00284BVC2,"It's hard to even call this a ""fly fishing video"" because the rest in the category aren't even close to this one.  ""Once in a Blue Moon"" has the story, the cinematography and stunning landscapes of one of the most beautiful places on earth (New Zealand) that puts it in competition with feature films-not the usual ""handy cam"" fishing videos.  This has been my go to gift for all my fishing buddies. Absolutely amazing.",1314489600,3,419,4.648648648648648
3871720,5,B00284BVC2,"Traumhafte Naturaufnahmen- einfach wunderschoen-Ich wuerde diese DVD sofort wieder bestellen!!! Die Bestellung dauerte wie angegeben und kam rechtzeitig an (Porto zwar etwas mehr, zahlt sich aber aus, wenn es eilig ist).",1312675200,,220,6.129032258064516
3871721,5,B00284BVC2,I played this at our flyfishing monthly club meeting. Everyone was thrilled and on the edge of their seats. I highly recommend it!,1308009600,,130,4.695652173913044
3871722,3,B00284BVC2,"It's a good film as far as fly-fishing videos go.  Where most are rather dry and look like they were filling the vacuum of pre-utube quality self made films.  I gave it three stars because the filming looks professional and the subject is fascinating, though I couldn't give it more because it leaves you wanting too much more.  It feels like a snickers bar when you expect to get a meal for the price of $30.  It lacks enough science to be educational and enough fly scenes to be what I consider a good piece for the fishing.  All in all, pretty to watch but to short to warrant the price.  Maybe Drift or Rise would have been a better purchase...",1307750400,2,648,4.31404958677686
3871723,5,B00284BVC2,"I needed a gift for my father who is an avid fisherman, but wanted something that was more than just two dudes on a boat all day. This film is fantastic. The cinematography is stellar and the story and action are fun to watch. Just wish it was 2 hrs and not 45 min!",1304812800,2,265,3.925925925925926
3871724,5,B00284BVC2,"I love this movie.  The filming and locations are beautiful and breathtaking.  My wife watched it with me the first time.  She has very little interest in fly fishing, but throughout the movie kept saying ""oh wow that is beautiful.""

My only complaint is that I was enjoying the movie so much when it ended after 45 minutes I was left wanting more.",1262131200,,348,4.476190476190476
8355626,5,B00284BVC2,"The hatches, the cinematography, the fishing - this is one of the best fly fishing films out there!",1490227200,,99,4.555555555555555
8355627,5,B00284BVC2,Best fly fishing video of all time.,1440028800,,35,4.142857142857143
8355628,1,B00284BVC2,"Dont be steered by all the 5 star reviews.. This film is TERRIBLE. Horrible editing, waaaay to many drone shots, and the worst part about this ""film"" is the lack of actual FISHING! Don't waste your money, I've actually never reviewed a thing in my life but I felt compelled to warn avid FlyFisherman like myself to avoid buying this at all cost.",1420761600,,345,4.492063492063492
8355629,5,B00284BVC2,"I have watched countless videos while working the fly shop.  Most are a couple people and a handycam with a shallow story line and sometimes not alot of knowledge.  This is the best flyfishing video bar none as far a cinematography.  No this is not a how to video, but if you enjoy doing something different, fishing with deer hair mice for big fish-- this is the best!",1420070400,,369,4.397058823529412
8355630,2,B00284BVC2,"This is by far the the worst fly-fishing video I have ever watched. I'm not sure why it has 4.5-stars, but it's pretty clear these reviewers have not seen videos like ""Eastern Rises"". The music is reminiscent of a bad porno-movie and the commentating sub-par. I gave it 2-stars as there where few underwater scenes that where worthy of a good film. Don't waste your time or your money.",1414886400,,385,4.594202898550725
