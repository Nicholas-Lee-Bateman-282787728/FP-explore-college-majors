1357326,5,B00004UGAU,"In my book, this movie ranks right up there with ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""E.T"" and ""The Breakfast Club"". It is a majorly great 80s film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. The basic  plot is that Big Bird moves away from Sesame Street to live with a foster  family in Oceanview, Illinois (one of the film's many jokes for the  adults). He doesn't like it there, so he goes on a cross-country adventure  back home, pursued by 2 evil circus owners (played by SCTV's Dave Thomas  and Joe Flaherty) and a welfare agent (voiced by Sally Kellerman). There  are also cameos by Chevy Chase (spoofing his role as Saturday Night Live's  ""Weekend Update"" anchor), Sandra Bernhard (as a grouchy  waitress), Waylon Jennings (playing a singing trucker), and the late John  Candy as a cop. The songs are great, and there are many pop-culture  references, including references to ""North By Northwest"", Donny  & Marie, and Michael Jackson. Sesame Street fans and parents, if you  don't have this movie, then get it! I'm 16 years old, and I still enjoy  this movie! It's great fun!",929059200,5,1074,4.679144385026738
1357327,5,B00004UGAU,"Follow that Bird is a movie that I remember watching as a kid.  The songs  are creative, the storyline is fun, and everything else about it just  rules!  I agree with joebuckstwister that everyone who watches this movie  will love it!!!  END",906076800,,241,4.619047619047619
1357328,5,B00004UGAU,"This is a great movie, involving everyone's favorite 8 foot tall bird. The storyline deals with Big Bird being sent off by a foster parent company to be with his ""own kind"". Of course, he does not like it there, and runs away. That's when the fun starts. Great songs and great scenes liven up this excellent piece of family entertainment.

1357355,5,B00004UGAU,"First, I'll say this arrived way sooner than expected! I remember this movie from when I was a kid and I loved it then but thought that it might not stand the test of time. My son loves sesame Street and especially elmo and I've grown tired of watching the same dvds over and over so I thought it was worth a try even thought it might be dated. I was very happily surprised, this movie is still great! Some of it is obviously dated but for the most part it's still a great movie to watch with the family, he loved it and I loved sharing it with him. I would definitely recommend this, especially to the 2 and 3 generation sesame Street families.",1477353600,,645,4.168

1357396,3,B00004UGAU,No real complaints on my end except my 17 month old hates it and cries if we put it on. I think it is a little advanced for him also because more of a story. We only let him watch about an hour of TV every three weeks (we have to drive 6 hours every three weeks for his medical treatment so we let him watch it to break up the drive) so he may just not be used to TV but he does love the Elmo videos so I am thinking it is just he doesn't like big bird.,1437782400,,453,3.54

This movie is actually so enjoyable with great cameos from Sandra Bernhard, Joe Flaherty, John Candy, Waylon Jennings, Chevy Chase, and Dave Thomas. I find a lot of the toddler-centric films are really obnoxious these days, but this one has great jokes and songs. I loved this movie so much as a child and I'm so happy I can share it with my kids now.

I can't wait to watch it with my grandson (and 28-yr-old son) and sing along to the cute catchy songs - takes me back.

Years later I decide to buy it and it hasn't lost it's charm with a lovable cast of Big Bird, Bert,Ernie,Cookie Monster,Oscar,Telly,Grover,and my all time fav. Count von Count who pratically steals the show. With all-star muppeteers like Jim Henson (last muppet movie he made ):,Frank Oz, Jerry Nelson ,and Richard Hunt (last muppet movie he was in):this is the best seasme movie eve. One complaint i do have is the new dvd cover which unlike the 2002 VHS re-issue has Elmo on it on the back AND the front when he wasn't even in the fricking movie. (thank god he would have ruined everything That was probably a marketing trick so the new school would want to fork over $4.99 for Elmo scences,but other then that this is truly a great way to spend 89 minutes for old scool muppet fans.

1357470,5,B00004UGAU,"I'm not ashamed to admit that I am almost 36, and just ordered this movie.......for myself!  I distinctly remember my parents taking my sister and I to see this at the theater in the Summer of 1985!  I enjoyed it then as a child of 8.....and I enjoy it now.  Not only for its nostalgia value, but the clever puns sprinkled throughout the film.  I love the cameos, especially Chevy Chase reprising his 'Saturday Night Live' news anchor shtick.

It's great to see the original Sesame Street cast in this, as this was the cast of characters I grew up watching as a child.....Gordon, Susan, Linda, Maria, Luis, Olivia....they're all here.  The songs featured in the film were very well written and executed as well.  My favorite being ""One Little Star"" which tugs on the heartstrings just a little bit!  :)

I love that this film was remastered and presented in widescreen for the first time.  To be able to see it the way it was originally presented in the theater is something I'm very happy about.

My only gripe.....albeit a very small one, is the fact that for some reason Warner Bros. decided to include Elmo on the cover.  Extremely misleading as you only see the puppet for a grand total of maybe 3 or 4 seconds, and he doesn't utter a word.  In fact, this was around the time Elmo was first introduced to the world, and was controlled and voiced by a different puppeteer before Kevin Clash eventually took over and made Elmo what he is today.  Kids will look at this cover thinking Elmo plays some sort of substantial part in the film.  Again, a small gripe.

I consider this film to be timeless.  Although kids who watch Sesame Street today may wonder where their favorite characters are, there is no arguing that the storyline will resonate with them, now and for years to come.  Highly recommended family entertainment not only for the nostalgic, but for the young.......and the young at heart!",1366761600,,1902,4.6101190476190474

1357493,5,B00004UGAU,"Before buying this movie, we would get it from the library as often as possible. It is filled with some catchy tunes and the Sesame Street of my youth (aka before Elmo). You actually see Elmo in a couple of shots, but he is not the star. Anyway, back to Big Bird. The general plot is that a bird council decides Big Bird should live with birds, so he flies (by plane) to Illinois to live with the Dodos. He never quite fits in and misses Sesame Street, so he runs away from the Dodos.
Another reason he runs away is the Dodos don't think he should have friends who are not birds (which is addressed when Big Bird gets a postcard from Snuffy). The majority of the movie addresses his trek home while many of the other Sesame Street residents try to find him.
I have heard several adoption groups find it offensive. I can truly appreciate their opinions. But, for Big Bird, I think Sesame Street is like an adoptive family where he is loved by all- even though no one else on Sesame Street looks like him.",1346716800,,1003,4.28421052631579

Big Bird was my favorite when I was a kid, if only because yellow was always my favorite color (therefore, Bert was obviously my second favorite!). I didn't remember much except that poor Big Bird was painted blue. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this movie was just as amusing for an adult with no children to watch!

This movie may even be more relevant today than it was in 1985. The well-meaning but misinformed social worker takes Big Bird from his real ""family"" to place him with his ""own kind."" They found out by the end of the movie what a poor idea that was. Although of course the entire gang on Sesame Street knew from the beginning that you do not have to be related by blood or look alike to have a real connection with someone.

There was real, genuine humor in this movie! Big Bird becomes Big Dodo. The fair is run by the Sleaze Brothers. Oscar's choice of restaurant is the Don't Drop Inn cafe. I laughed often. And the music was very good as well. Definitely worth 4 stars!",1339977600,,1050,4.324873096446701

I think it's safe to say that she's watched this pretty much every day for the last 2 months. It's classic sesame street with the original cast of characters - many in their younger form ;) My daughter also enjoys singing the songs on her own. At less than 10 bucks this is a bargain.

Astute observers will also note Elmo's cameo appearance.

One of my earliest memories is sitting in the theatre weeping over Big Bird's Lonely Bluebird. I'd been watching a lot of old cartoons thanks to DVD and the internet, so I was wary that time had also been a cruel mistress to this movie as well.

I was pleasantly surprised that this is still an adorable movie. I watched it (27) with my brothers (21 and 15) and our mom (48) and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. But then I am a big kid and will still watch Sesame Street on occasion. The songs are fun, and if you remember the early (er... mid, I'm not that old) days of Sesame Street, it's fun to see all your favorite muppets and people again.

There are cameos by Chevy Chase and Kermit the Frog as well as a reference to 'North by Northwest' Some things you may not have appreciated when you were a kid.

So I don't know about how little kids appreciate it nowadays, but I can certainly recommend it to anyone who is not afraid to be a big kid and enjoys a bit of nostalgia now and again.",1281744000,,1100,4.130841121495327
1357515,5,B00004UGAU,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

""Sesame Street Presents - Follow That Bird"" exemplifies what is best about the Sesame Street brand.  A very heartfelt story that wisely puts the appealing Big Bird front and center in a versatile movie, I loved it as a child and recommend it wholeheartedly as a movie with true cross-generational appeal.

Big Bird is happily living on Sesame Street as the movie opens, enjoying his life and his trustworthy diverse friends.  All that changes when a bird named Miss Finch of the satirical Feathered Friends Society fussily convinces Big Bird he'd be happier living exclusively with birds.  The remainder of the movie follows a very unhappy Big Bird as he tries aimlessly to walk back to Sesame Street from a place called Oceanview, Illinois.  He is trailed by both Miss Finch(voiced by Sally Kellerman of the movie ""MASH"",) and the true friends who want to see him safely on Sesame Street again.

This is a wonderful movie with underappreciated songs and a sizable amount of star cameos from the likes of Waylon Jennings and John Candy.  Deep themes of personal connections to people, loyalty, and love ground the movie powerfully.  I give it a very high recommendation.",1280102400,,1187,4.924623115577889

It was mentioned that Elmo isn't in it and personally it's nice not having a muppet that is always the favorite and the center of attention being the main character.

It's a timeless great, the songs are amazing and the character's and actors in perfect form, as usual.  Buy this movie...you won't regret it!!!",1255478400,,401,4.32
1357524,5,B00004UGAU,"This movie was so great! Some of my favorite parts in this movie include Big Bird screaming ""HELP! HELP!"" when he is caught by the Sleaze Brothers.

The movie opens with Oscar the Grouch (Caroll Spinney, who also played Big Bird, of course) introducing to us his ""Grouch Anthem,"" which at mid-song features other Grouches moaning while Oscar delivered his spoken monologue, before they all sing the song's chorus (""Don't let the sunshine spoil the rain ...""). It then goes to Big Bird pumping up an inflatable ""W"" which then flies high away and into the sky, where it turns into the ""W"" in the Warner Bros. shield logo.

The movie resumes with the Feathered Friends organization, who eye Big Bird for adoption by a dodo family living in Oceanview, IL, whose own son (voiced by Eddie Deezen) and daughter (voiced by Cathy Silvers, the daughter of the late Phil Silvers) are named after the two most famous Osmond siblings. Miss Finch (Sally Kellerman) is one of the key people of the FF. We then cut to Sesame Street where Big Bird currently is, where we see the movie's title graphic. Big Bird, after he bids adieu on SS, initially takes to loving his new family, but soon grew tired of them when their traditional family life didn't match that of his own on SS. He left them because only his bird friends could visit them, not his best friend Snuffleupagus. This is where the real journey now starts.

As Big Bird makes his way back to SS, he has to deal with not only Miss Finch, but now he also must face the Sleaze Brothers (Joe Flaherty as Sid, and Dave Thomas as Sam), two circus owners who hope to use him for a major attraction of theirs (The Blue Bird of Happiness, which we witness later on). Big, as Miss Finch refers to him, initially gets help from a turkey truck driver (portrayed by late country musician Waylon Jennings), to which we cue the song ""Ain't No Road Too Long.""

At the end of the scene where we see Big Bird rescued by way of jumping off of the Sleaze Brothers' truck and onto the front hood of a Volkswagen Beetle, courtesy of Gordon and Olivia. The Sleazes are then apprehended by the state trooper (John Candy) who is assisted by a black boy who we'd seen earlier in the film, for which he accused one of the Sleazes of stealing his apple.

Big Bird returns to SS, and the movie ends after Maria tells Miss Finch all about Sesame Street and its gang.

1357531,5,B00004UGAU,"This is one of the finest Muppet productions of the mid 1980's. The films songs, ""Upside Down World"", ""Easy Goin' Day"", ""Ain't No Road Too Long"" and Big Birds lament ""I'm a Blue Bird"", are songs which have stayed alive for many children the world over.

Sesame Street's Follow that Bird, as I recall, was the first film to tell a story about the streets characters and we were invited to see more of their world ... the street itself was rebuilt and expanded and had a rich realistic feel and artistically the look was very credible and contrasted the Muppet characters more imaginatively.

Everything about the production was inspiring, the story was clear and tight, characters were very well performed, the puppetry as you might expect was first rate and parents enjoyed seeing the comic talents from John Candy and Chevy Chase who cameo ... Kermit even makes an appearance as his role as Muppet Reporter and if you look carefully you can see Elmo sometimes in the background, but you have to remember, this was all before he became a big star.

Follow that Bird is really Big Birds story and for a generation who remember Sesames early years it is about time the big yellow chap got some cheers again for being such an inspiring figure. The production naturally has the Henson stamp on it but this is a film which once again supports the goals and aspirations of The Children's Television Workshop and if you haven't seen this film yet or you are thinking of showing it to your children for the first time, then do purchase a copy as this film does not play down to kids at all ... as with all the early Henson productions and related projects the Henson troop found themselves involved in, they always conveyed what they felt they would want their children to understand about the world and what they created was first rate entertainment which had something real in the offering.

Big Bird was sent to go live with another bird family by a Bird Adoption Agency and he did not like it there.  So he decided to walk home, which the bird family thought he ran away.  The people from Sesame Street went to look for him, before the Bird Adoption Agency that made him go live with the other family could find him.  There was a lot of funny things that happened and fun songs that kids and grown up would like.

I recommend this movie to kids and grown ups.",1216080000,,549,3.9454545454545453
1357534,4,B00004UGAU,"This is an interesting movie in that it really shows realities of the human condition. The movie starts with a bird agency deciding that Big Bird can not be happy because he is not living with other birds. So, they decide he has to leave Sesame Street to live with a bird family. (The DODOs.) They expose a harsh reality here. More often than not, these agencies make decisions and pass judgments WITHOUT knowing what they are talking about or establishing the facts. (Especially agencies that are suppose to help people with disabilities.)

If we want to go a bit further, the great Shakespeare said in ""King Lear:"" 'striving to better, oft we mar what's well.' Moving on, Ms. Finch (of the agency) goes to Sesame Street and convinces Big Bird he will be happier with the Dodos who live in Illinois. Back in SS New York, Big Bird's friends are of course upset, but they agree it is Big Bird's decision to make. BB's friend Mr. Snuffalupugus is especially sad, but BB convinces him he can visit.

Without going on too long, the Dodos make the naive Big Bird look really intelligent. While BB can tolerate their unintelligence, he can not tolerate it when they won't let Mr. Snuffalupugus visit because he is not a bird. Big Bird runs away, and his friends back at SS see the story on tv and decide they have to look for him. His friends (despite their flaws) go off to look for him. (Even Oscar the Grouch!)

But things are not going to be simple. Ms. Finch is still looking for BB to bring him back to the Dodos, and a corrupt entertainment duet is after Big Bird to use him for financial gain.

While this movie may APPEAR to be for children, it raises many aspects of the human condition, (Agencies who don't know what they are doing, corruption, flawed friends trying their best, etc.) Between the suspense, comic relief, and good songs, this movie is seldom boring. In some ironic moments, some of BB's friends get close to him, but miss him. (Ernie and Bert find him, but lose him just as quickly. We're not sure whether to laugh or cry!)

I am delighted to say it's even funnier now that I'm older and can understand some of the clever, witty humor that passed over my head during much younger years.  I laughed out loud, and even sang along to the songs.

This movie is funny for the whole family - it really is.  It has all your favorite characters you loved growing up, and more!  It has the classic, simple humor and enjoyment you just can't seem to find in television and movies today.

1357548,4,B00004UGAU,"Well that's what Ms. Finch will have you believe anyway. I waited 21 years to watch this, and now I don't know why? I can only say that I was afraid, and not feeling good about myself as a person that I could watch this, and still be cool. I see that I was wrong not to realize that Sesame Street will always be a part of my life, and that I took a piece of my life away from me, and threw it away, so I can have friends, and yet they wouldn't have cared. I'm sure that some of the girls I was sweet on in high school would've watched this anyway as they had little babies already. I regret having sold myself cheap this way as this was actually better than I first thought. It has a pretty good cast besides the usual Sesame Street actors with cameos of Chevy Chase doing his tribute to public television by reciting the theme song from Mr. Roger's Neighborhood, John Candy as a patrol man, and a host of others including Waylon Jennings who sings a good song in this. I got hooked up in trying to be cool with watching the sexual movies, and trying to laugh at the scenes where the women were moaning in ecstasy. This was considered normal in my high school, and I felt I had to steel myself against wholesome family movies as this. Mind you this is the beginning of politically correct movies as society tries to convince people that it doesn't matter as long as there's love, but in a way Ms. Finch has a point that Big Bird may have been better off living with birds, but if the birds don't portray love, and give love then Big Bird is better off being with people who will. In alot of ways this can apply to those who try to avoid this movie, or lie about watching it to impress people; you are missing out, and selling yourselves cheap.

The story begins at the Feathered Friends Agency, when Miss Finch decides to send Big Bird to the Dodo family's house in Oceanview, Illinois. Big Bird did have a nice time, but when the Dodos tell him that Mr. Snuffleupagus (A.K.A. Snuffy) is not allowed to visit because he is not a bird, Big Bird heads back to Sesame Street. Everyone hears about it on the news, and is now on the trail of that big yellow tail!

My little brother (who personally normally doesn't like Sesame Street) enjoys this movie, too. We both find the Dodos hilarious and love all of their jokes.

There aren't many special features on the DVD to comment on, but at least I'm thankful this classic movie is now on DVD.

The movie is geared towards children, but I can honestly say that adults will love it, too! There's a lot of funny moments in this video that my younger sisters and I still love! (And we're all older)!

For instance, the Dodo family that Big Bird goes to stay with say some hilarious things, such as, ""You've got to come home before you can leave"", and the two men who try to find Big Bird for their fun fare are really funny, too! They kind of remind me of the two villians in 101 dalmations because one comes up with all the ideas and the other one sort of follows along.

Kids who love Big Bird will love this movie! Big Bird, Snuffy, the count, Oscar, Bert and Ernie, Cookie, and many other memorable characters, including Bob, Maria, Linda, and Gordon come together in this delightful movie!

1357559,4,B00004UGAU,"A Blast from the Past: Follow That Bird!

I came across this video at a thrift shop and snapped it up for nostalgia's sake. It was Sesame Street's first full-length movie, ""Follow That Bird"".

I remember going to see the live drama production for my sister's birthday when we must have been somewhere between 4 and 8. We were so dazzled by it that I still remember it pretty well all these years later, after seeing it just once.

Often I find that movies I remember fondly from my childhood just don't stand up to rewatching years later, but this one is a noteable exception. I found that the story was well-told and interesting even this many years later. Of course, it helped that I was watching it with my own two- and three-year olds, who were glued to it and wanted to watch it again as soon as it ended.

One thing to note is that my 3 1/2 year-old gets very emotionally involved and gets a bit upset and scared if she watches this movie without an adult. So if you are watching it with young children, you will want to watch it with them and be sensitive to how they are responding. It is a rather emotionally intense movie for a young child, although I would still recommend it for all ages.

The girls and I really enjoyed this video. The basic premise is that the interfering Feathered Friends Society of birds decides to place Big Bird in a home with a bird family, since he ""belongs with his own kind"" and ""can't possibly be happy"" in a different kind of home.

Spoilers:

Big Bird misses Sesame Street, and when his new bird family won't allow Big Bird's best friend Snuffy to come and visit him because Snuffalupagus is not a bird, Big Bird decides to go home to Sesame Street.

He takes off walking across several states toward home, with Miss Finch from the FFS chasing after him to try to make him return to the bird family, The Dodos. Along the way he also ends up being chased by a pair of cheating carnival masters, who want to display him in a sideshow to make money.

Meanwhile, Big Bird's friends from Sesame Street head out in three or four different directions, determined to find him before Miss Finch does. Bert and Ernie in an airplane, Oscar the Grouch and Maria in the grouchmobile, and other amusing combinations of characters make for a fun and humorous ride.

End of spoiler

Admittedly, the movie is geared toward the under-ten crowd and a lot of the songs and jokes are a bit corny, but I enjoyed it immensely. For any adult who enjoyed Sesame Street as a kid, this is a movie you will enjoy reminiscing with. I laughed at the jokes, enjoyed the music and got a bit teary-eyed at the sad parts even as a ""grown-up"".

The message that sometimes interfering social agencies try to fix what's not broken and would be better off staying out of many situations is not lost, either.",1105747200,7,2812,4.417794970986461

  Its good humor, good songs ok quite corny at times but also quite sweet.  It shows the whole gang out to help their friend find his way home.  With a few embedded lessons like bad things can happen if you accept rides from strangers.  Without terrifying them.  Showing that family is not just who you look like  but who you love.  Especially good lesson for adopted children.  that friends are valuable family too.

I first watched this movie as a little kid.  I rented it on tape from the library.  Every time we'd go back I'd get it. I watched it so many times.  The characters were always lovable (familiar faces like Bert and Ernie, the Count, the Grouch, and all the people from Sesame Street) and I loved singing along to the songs.
But now at least 10 years later I still find the movie as charming and fun as ever.  I hadn't been to the library in years and as soon as I walked in I went off searching for ""that movie with Big Bird in it.""
Follow that Bird has a great story.  It follows all the Sesame Street characters as Big Bird gets sent to live with these crazy Dodo birds and then goes on to run away.  His Sesame Street pals and others set off in search of him.  And it all combines to be one great goose, or in this case, Big Bird Chase!",1056240000,,998,4.005050505050505

The Muppet humor is just as sharp as ever so adults will have no problem enjoying this fim as much as children do.  Fans of the show might be as happy as I was with the inclusion of Olivia in the cast.  She has  such a beautiful singing voice and luckily gets to use it in this film.  However, the most delightful treat for fans is to see Jim Henson once again performing Kermit and Ernie.  He's such a master puppeteer and has such good chemistry with the other characters (especially Bert).  Watch the subtle facial expressions he gives Kermit and the honest plafulness of Ernie.  A treat in deed.  We miss you Jim.
As for the DVD itself, the picture is bright but somewhat soft like it's been transferred from video instead of film.  Clearly no restoration work has been done on picture or audio.  Also, I'm a purist and it's just not right to release a film in Pan and Scan without an OAR option as this release has done.  There are several places where a widescreen transfer is obviously missing and it just bugs me to no end.  The disc is bare bones with only a 'Jump to a song' option and the original trailer.

Follow that Bird was one of my favorite childhood films and when I found out it was entering the digital realm, I couldn't wait to own my own copy of it on a shiny never-wears-out disc.  The day it came out, I bought it...even though the back of the case said that it was ""standard"" (full frame) and only had Dolby 2.0 sound.  That's the equivalent of seeing it on video.  I was very disappointed.  Sure, it's a kids' movie...but it's a classic.  And yes, ""those cotton-pickin' black bars"" that come with widescreen movies annoy some unenlighted viewers.  But really.  At least give us standard on one side and widescreen on another.  As an interesting (if baffling) sidenote, to add insult to injury, the only extra on this disc besides scene selection is the theatrical trailer...AND it's in widescreen.  What's up with that, Warner Brothers???
As for the sound, Dolby 2.0 is what is on most videocassettes and most TV shows.  If you have surround sound on your home theater system, 5.1 or DTS is the only way to go.  DVD is capable of so many things, and I used to think the WB was wonderful with their DVDs...but they have really disappointed me with this one (and Willy Wonka for that matter).  Come ON!  Widescreen TVs will be in everyone's living rooms within the next few years...why not start preparing for it now?  I mean, even ER on TV is in widescreen!

And the case is Big Bird (Carroll Spinney), who the chairbird thinks he is a stray bird living on Sesame Street.
A memember named Miss Finch (Sally Kellerman) decides that Big Bird should leave with his ""own kind"". Which is birds. She visits him on Sesame Street and talks him into moving out of Sesame Street and move to Oceanview, Illinois. And leave with a family called the dodos.
A couple of Big Bird friends listen in the conversation that Big Bird and Miss Finch are having. And giving word to other people leaving on Sesame Street. Like a man named Bob (Bob McGrath), Gordon (Roscoe Orman). There is aslo an fix-it couple named Luis and Maria (Emilio Delgado & Sonia Manzano). Big Bird hires his friend named Snuffy to watch his nest while his is gone.
And word spends to a monster named Gover, Count who loves to count. Once in Oceanview Big Bird meets the dodos and says, ""I'm Big Bird."" And Daddy Dodo says, ""No your not your Big Dodo."" Big Dodo. I thought his name is Big Bird, not Big Dodo. They live in a somewhat bird house. Big Bird sends Maria a letter because before he left he promised to write.

The story line for this movie is pretty simple: Big Bird feeling as though he has nobody (meaning other birds) to really talk to on Sesame Street decides to move out and live with a bird family called the ""Dodos"".  However, once settled in with the Dodos, Big Bird decides that they are even too ""brainless"" for him.  In the middle of the night, Big Bird sneaks out of the Dodos home and begins a kind of ""lost"" roadtrip.  While Big Bird is out on the road, the rest of the Sesame Street gang, having received a rather sad home sick letter from Big Bird, set out on their own to try to find and bring back home their beloved friend.  Eventually, the rest of the gang do find Big Bird being held captive by a couple of greedy exhibitionists.  Of course, in the end they manage to free our giant feathered friend, the bad guys are caught, and everybody lives happily ever after.
Even though not as good as the Muppet series of films (the first 3 Muppet films anyway), ""Follow That Bird"" truly is a magical film for all ages, and can be enjoyed by anyone who has an imagination and wants to relive some of their childhood memories.
