7958249,5,B0000632JF,This was a gift ....Jazz lover absolutely loved this!!,1473897600,,54,5.111111111111111
7958250,3,B0000632JF,I gave this a 3 star rating but I'm sure it deserves 5 stars.  I haven't listened to it because it is a gift for my great grandson.  He has been playing drums for several years and is very talented.  He is very innovative and I think he will like this DVD lot.  I'm sure it will give him great listening and watching enjoyment.,1418428800,,327,4.0625
7958251,5,B0000632JF,"Just truly eye-opening what the human body can do. As a spectator/listener, I am continually blown away by these feats of both
athleticism, entertainment and pure musicianship. Regardless of the artist, there is always a new wonder to behold.",1385164800,,242,5.230769230769231
7958252,3,B0000632JF,"I've been buying a number of videos of classic jazz lately, none of them purporting to be focusing on drummers, and many of them have better footage of the drummers ""featured"" on this video--I'm thinking in particular of Gene Krupa and Ray Bauduc.  And when the drummers are actually featured here, i.e., a solo, sometimes there are strange, inexplicable edits.  Why does the video cut away from Joe Morello when he's just getting into his solo?  Why cut away from Kenny Clarke's solo?  Why the Philly Joe Jones footage that looks like it was shot with a home camcorder?

This isn't a terrible video, it's just that a lot of the time it doesn't do justice to the drummers it's supposedly featuring.",1357344000,2,698,4.688524590163935
7958253,5,B0000632JF,"Whether you are a hard-core jazz fan or someone with a passing knowledge of this music form, this is a DVD you must watch. It is simply incredible and offers a nice 'recap' of the best jazz drummers in music history. I enjoyed all the drummers who appear on this DVD but my favorites are Buddy Rich, Lionel  Hampton, and Philly Joe Jones.

While some of the video transitions from one segment to another are not quite as smooth as we are accustomed to in this day of video technology, that is okay, because the musical performances are amazing.

If I had a young child I wanted to expose to jazz, this would be the DVD I would show him/her.",1206403200,7,640,4.316666666666666
7958254,5,B0000632JF,"I really enjoyed watching this DVD.  It gives you an appreciation of the roots of jazz drummers and how their talents and innovative approaches to drumming set the stage for the great drummers of today.  Although some of the film footage of the early jazz drummers is lacking by today's standards, the amazing skills of the early jazz drummers is still captured. I would recommend to anyone who is a drummer or is intrest in early roots of jazz or drumming.",1204416000,,457,4.62962962962963
7958255,5,B0000632JF,"First, a bit of a warning... This is NOT a drum instructional DVD... There's no instruction, nor are all the shots EXCLUSIVELY overheads of drum kits.  In a CLASSIC ""soundie"" clip of THE COUNT BASIE ORCHESTRA you don't even see Sonny Payne up close until that classic ending (and I'm somewhat surprized it didn't get censored if you realize the apparent symbolism of his gestures...! ! !) - - With that said, this DVD is a rare chance to see many of the greats in their hey day and some really funny moments as well (such as the drum battles and the shot of Milt Buckner playing piano with Lionel Hampton and bobbing up and down so violently he looks like he's about to go through the roof.)  Also featured is rare footage of Philly Joe... a wild shot of Poppa Joe doing the conga trick with the drums...  a VERY young Buddy Rich... and a delightfully fun clip with Cab Calloway.  Kenny Clarke's there too... in fact, the most fun and educational part of the video is getting to see the volution of the different drumming styles.

All in all, I think its deceptive to call this a drum video... Its a brilliant compilation of clips (some complete, some edited) that should be delightful to all swinging Jazz lovers !",1129420800,9,1215,4.479638009049774
7958256,5,B0000632JF,"This dvd along with Classic Solos Vol 1 and 2 from Hudson Music provide a great  view of the most important drummers in history. Watching the clips really gave me a great understanding of how drumming has evolved over the years and is very helpful to see, no matter what style you play in. A must for your collection.",1071187200,12,317,4.372881355932203
