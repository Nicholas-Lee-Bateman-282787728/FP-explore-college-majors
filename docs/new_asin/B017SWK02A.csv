7533261,3,B017SWK02A,"Loved season 1.  But by season 2, it's obvious that he's such a jerk and there's no way the ending would redeem him -- because his character has been shown to be a greedy self-centered cad (hence, his last-second selflessness rang totally false).  Loved Maura Tierney.",1473638400,4,268,4.804347826086956

7533274,5,B017SWK02A,"The way in which this show is presented to viewers is just genius, from each person's different perspective. Let's face it, no one sees or goes through an experience in the same way. Each season just keeps getting better and better with new twists and turns added. Unfortunately, life is very complicated, each of these characters are very different and have specific reasons for why they do what they do. Watching The Affair, you feel like you are on a ride through each one of them. Definitely one of the best shows I have seen in a long time. Highly recommended!",1480377600,,565,4.603960396039604
7533275,2,B017SWK02A,I'm sure this appeals to some people but it makes me sick. My husband destroyed our family this way and it's very realistic. Your hit like a bolt out of nowhere. The acting is just okay. The woman keeps coming back at him and eventually he can't stay away from her. You hate to blame the woman but in my case and many others of people i know it happened the same way. I couldn't finish watching it. It made me sick to watch the wife and kids fall apart and the man can just walk away for a younger woman.,1480377600,4,504,4.0

Am totally hooked on this series and can't wait for season 3.  The 3 main characters are excellent and the plot continues to thicken.  Am glad to see Ruth Wilson again.  She was great in Luther.",1478476800,5,236,4.295454545454546

8740546,1,B017SWK02A,"Never opened. Bought all three seasons at one time.  See our review of season One.  Season one was so sexually graphic within the first 1/2 hour, would not recommend.  The series was not rated.  Couldn't return because we were a few days past the return deadline.",1509840000,,263,4.6521739130434785

8740549,5,B017SWK02A,"Excellent series, Addicting",1495065600,,27,8.333333333333334
8740550,4,B017SWK02A,"While season 1 centered on the excitement of a long time married man (Noah) having his 1st affair with a much younger woman (Alison) who is also married, season 2 is focused on how an extra-marital affair can have the effect of a wrecking ball on a family (Noah's in this case).  Even when both partners want to be amicable, it is still a dicey situation.

The story is told in a Faulkneresque type of fashion with a scrambled time-line and many sequences told from different points of view.  What you need to key-in on is what the different perspectives have in common as it is never obvious as to which perspective has the most veracity.  Beyond the scandal is a criminal investigation and many flash-forwards indicate small morsels of information which serve as clues as to what the outcome will be.

With a title like THE AFFAIR + the fact that it is an uncensored series on SHOWTIME, one would think that it would score very high on the skin-o-meter.  In season one we get a few quick glimpses of Ruth Wilson's nipples.  In the 2nd season?  Nada.  This was an unusual decision, at least in my mind.  There is brief nudity in a few episodes of a few secondary characters, but that is it.  So....if you're looking for salacious this might not be the best place to go.

That said, the storyline is compelling of a struggling author trying to make his way in the world who is coupled with a former nurse who has a deep sense of guilt over something that happened a long time ago.  This is not top notch TV, but it is entertaining.",1494720000,,1531,4.425
8740551,4,B017SWK02A,"Like all of these seasons, this series is a strong reminder of the potential fallout of married people having an affair-children, jobs,etc. all affected negatively. Is it really worth it?",1492646400,2,187,5.266666666666667
8740552,5,B017SWK02A,Very happy,1491609600,,10,4.5
