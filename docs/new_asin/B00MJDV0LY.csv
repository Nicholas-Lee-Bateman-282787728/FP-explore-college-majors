6583496,5,B00MJDV0LY,"How we feel about movies is extremely subjective.  Even when it comes to movie blockbusters it's easy to see differing views.  When you compare the landscape on big budget movies and independent style movies it's like moving into a brave new world with each movie.  For me sometimes it feels like I'm a single voice without anyone to feel connected to.  In many ways that is why this movie is so special.  First off, this is a Zach Braff project which he wrote with his brother Adam.  Production for the movie was based on a Kickstarter campaign which was met with a great reaction, making its production goal in only three days.  Seeing the project come together over the past year has been a lot of fun seeing who was joining the cast and what the ideas were surrounding the story.  It's funny because ""Garden State"" was a project, while I enjoyed, I did not love.  That particular movie had a similar production level and amazing cast but for whatever reason it didn't have that ""it"" factor.  Simply put, this was not the same experience.  Maybe it's because of where I am in my own life but I absolutely loved this movie.

The story is a crossroad of events that take place.  For Zach Braff's character, Aiden Bloom, he is the father of two who makes his living based off of small acting bits.  So, in reality much of the money making is left to his wife who is played by Kate Hudson.  His two children are played by Joey King and Pierce Gagnon and are both attending school at a Jewish center.  The spark that begins the change in the movie comes when Bloom's father, played by Mandy Patinkin comes forth announcing that he terminally ill.  This causes Bloom to look at his life and do some things, like reconnect with his brother who is played by Josh Gad.  Let me say that I think the movie is more about the characters themselves than the story that plays out.  All of the characters in this film are faulted human beings who have issues that they must deal with.  Each character is played wonderfully by their respective actor and actress.  Also, if you are a fan of either ""Garden State"" or ""Scrubs"" you'll see a whole slew of familiar faces here and there played by alumni of each project.

Another point of interest, one of the things that I enjoyed so much about ""Garden State"" which makes a repeat here is that the soundtrack is amazing.  Every song choice fit so well with the movie and it made me feel that extra something for each scene.  It certainly doesn't hurt that I'm a general fan of alternative music so many of these songs were some that I already owned or listen to.

In the end, I suppose it's a tricky thing for me to put down a review for a movie that I've already established that I love.  I already know based on review sites that this movie did not hit with everyone who saw it but for the people who enjoyed it as much as I do I just hope that I can spread the love in some way.  Again, independent movies aren't gonna hit with everyone but I sincerely hope you give this movie a watch if you're the least bit interested because you may come out of with a new joy.",1407628800,12,3098,4.351916376306621

6583498,5,B00MJDV0LY,"The Boise library system has TONS of DVD's available for checkout, including many films I'd never seen or even heard of before. This one looked interesting, so I decided to take a chance.

I LOVE semi-surreal comedies. Several of my favorite movies were directed by Wes Anderson. Another favorite is ""I Heart Huckabees,"" made by David O. Russell (some of his other movies are great as well). I also highly recommend ""Stranger Than Fiction"" and ""The Darwin Awards.""

""Wish I Was Here"" fits in perfectly with those films. It's weird. There are quirky characters. The film is both funny and tragic. The acting is good. I like that there are Jewish characters. I'm not Jewish, and don't know much about Judaism, but I like the rabbis in this film. They're great.

Except for ""Almost Famous,"" I haven't appreciated Kate Hudson, but she does well in this film. She's the responsible member of the family. Zach Braff's character, and that character's brother are both loony. The kids are quite funny.

This film is rated R for loads of profanity, including kids swearing, one brief whacking off scene (no anatomy shown except for the guy's backside) and one bizarre, brief, and funny sex scene.",1500249600,,1187,4.861386138613861

6583500,4,B00MJDV0LY,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"".  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

Related quite a bit to Zach Braff's protagonist character.  Just wish my Mom had my back and understood me like Zach's character's Mom.  I'd say, as a film, its about on par with Garden State, so if you liked Garden, you'll probably like this.  If you found Garden ""pretentious"" or whatever, you'll probably feel the same about this.  Can't say I loved Garden like some people, but it was fine for what it was (quirky indie dramedy), as is this.  Couldn't pick a fave between the two, but since this one's more recent, I'll review this one, haha.  But yeah, stuff like this is right up my alley these days.  So if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494374400,2,1672,4.545150501672241

6583507,5,B00MJDV0LY,"A very funny and insightful movie relating the trials and troubles of a family man relying on his wife to be the bread winner, whilst he tries to obtain acting roles. His family is probably dysfunctional but he doesn't seem to see the ramifications of his lack of work. In the midst of all this his father is extremely ill, his brother is lounging in a caravan by the sea and not interested in much at all, especially in reconciling his differences with his father. The main character is a dreamer and believes he can succeed in his endeavours but life keeps throwing curve balls at him testing his resolve.

6583545,5,B00MJDV0LY,This is a phenomenal movie. I went through the loss of both of my parents in less than a year. First it was my mom (she was the last one anyone expected to go so soon) followed by my father. My brother and I basically stopped talking talking after my mom passed. I took care of my parents alone and I buried them alone. This movie really hit home not only in terms of the length someone would go to try to keep family together but the growth and wisdom that comes along with this process. I had a moment of regret of not being with my dad when he passed but I realized that he did not want me to see him suffer. He must have felt that I've seen him through enough and I'd sacrificed enough and he wanted me to be with friends doing something that I loved. This movie reminded me that I did all that I could have done for both of my parents and I have no regrets. I balled like a baby like out loud and that is very rare for me. Zach Braff is amazing. Thank you.,1452038400,,961,3.933333333333333

6583562,5,B00MJDV0LY,"Today I heard Zach Braff in an interview with Sam Jones, saying that the reactions to his attempts to do a new kind of indie film... and the reactions to the film itself, this one... had pretty much made him not want to dive deep inside himself for any more personal films for a long time.

Reconsider, Zach.

I rewatched Garden State for the first time in years, right before downloading and watching Wish I Was Here this evening, and I must say even more than GS, this film is a mature and intimate gem. Whatever negative reactions the film got could only have been from people who just don't get how to watch a portrait like this and appreciate your having allowed us in.

The film is thoughtful, gentle, quietly funny, and heartrending. It doesn't look for villains and allows for a dozen kinds of heroism. It's got a rare kind of spiritualism that's about both the human spirit and the infinitein whatever form we find it, at big moments and small. Braff wastes no time in judgements and writes the reality we all live through, with no varnish and no supersizing for the screen. Thank goodness.

If it's true that the filmgoing audience has become too cynical for such portraits, then we may never see another Places in the Heart, or Steel Magnolias, Before Sunrise, or even My Dinner With Andre.... In Wish I Was Here, it feels like Zach Braff has a grasp of the quiet moments in all of those films and still manages some of the self-aware humor of a young Woody Allen.

I laughed out loud *and* I cried. I forgot that I wasn't inside the scenes at times. I watch enough film to know that achieving any one of those is becoming rarer and rarerkudos for your hat trick, Mr. Braff.

I hope anyone reading this review will put aside the chatter and allow this un-jaded little gem to get under their skin for a little while.",1436313600,4,1826,4.452095808383233
6583563,4,B00MJDV0LY,"Zach Braff of `Scrubs' fame stars as Aiden Bloom a failed actor who relies on his wife and father for financial succour and support. Then his father can no longer afford to pay for the children's private Jewish schooling and he has to `home teach' them as the public school is a non option.

He starts to discover more about himself through his attempts to teach and in so doing gets more connected with himself and the World. Now that is the basic synopsis but what this really works at is being one of those life style, soap opera type comedies. This is not laugh a minute but it really does have its moments and they work really well. The actors all do a fine job especially the kids who seemed so natural that it looked effortless.

Kate Hudson as his wife is as charming as she is beautiful and they manage to get that chemistry of a love that has been put to the test and is still fighting to stay alive. I really enjoyed this film, there is a fair bit of swearing here in case that offends, but mostly done for the comic effect or as a well placed expression of disbelief. Not a single bad performance and  brilliantly directed by Zach who also co-wrote this and has proven he is as good behind the camera as he is in front of it - easily recommended.",1436054400,2,1258,4.2552301255230125

6583579,5,B00MJDV0LY,"Directed and starting Zach Braff, Wish I Was Here (2014) is a dramatic comedy about a certain dysfunctional family who deals with money issues, career choices, and approaching death in a family.  Zach Braff plays Aiden, a California want-to-be actor married to an office worker Sarah (Kate Hudson) with two kids who they send to a religious Jewish school.  Aiden is struggling to make a career for himself in the show business.  His wife Sarah, is the only one who supports the family with her steady job.  That creates friction in their marriage. By the way, this must be Hudson's best role I have seen so far.  Not only does she look beautiful in the film, her acting is very touching.  Along the way, the viewer is introduced to Aiden's ailing father and quirky brother...

Everything in this film seems ""perfect""...most importantly the storyline is simple yet compelling...I think everyone in the world can find something in this film that they can relate to.  The message of the film is universal...""cherish every moment with your loved ones...it is never too late for forgiveness, amends, reconciliation,...and never give up...even if you fail every time""...because no one said that life is easy.",1431648000,5,1202,4.975

It is a really well thought out movie with great players like Zach Braff, Kate Hudson and Mindy Patinkin. The movie is clever and thoughtful at the same time. Well worth my time. Just like ""Garden State,"" I will be thinking about the characters and plot line for a while. The story line around his father and brother was a little contrived but I think they managed through it well. Definitely worth the watch.",1431043200,,522,4.391752577319588

Unfortunate need for R rating because the opening sequence kicks off with a string of F bombs plus an occasional sprinkling later. Otherwise there isn't much else that warrants an R rating.  Defintely a mid-life crisis situation and typical family drama coupled with some Jewish religion in the background.

6583587,4,B00MJDV0LY,"i enjoyed it... the most interesting character for me was the evolution of the Grand Father, he started off with being a very critical father, that his two sons have ""failed"" in life, to the point of alienating his youngest son... even to point of his grandchildren to some extent? And yet when it came down to his last moments, he craved touch, feeling, compassion, and wanting to connect with them, for the last time, as though as much as he was critical of them to start, at the end, he craved their compassion. Otherwise, Kate character was the rock while Zach character was searching for something, although he wasn't quite sure what it was... and his kids take it all in, while displaying the same curiousity and fears and wonder that all young children do... i think this film is metaphor for all our lives, fragile, struggles, searching for meaning, being placed in hebrew school and whether or not that satisfies us, couples relationships in the face of struggles of parenting while being whole as a person....",1428364800,,1019,4.730337078651686

6583592,4,B00MJDV0LY,"While I'd be lying if I said I wasn't somewhat disappointed by Zach Braff's latest film, there's still a lot to enjoy in Wish I Was Here despite it never reaching the level of Garden State.

Braff does a good job in front of and behind the camera creating the same great atmosphere from his previous film along with some excellent cinematography and one of the best soundtracks I've heard in recent memory. The film is very much a Dramedy and does a good job of keeping the tone balanced delivering a fair dose of laughs along with dramatic tearjerking moments as well. All of the cast gives great performances and Joey King and Mandy Patinkin are two of the best child actors I've seen in a film in recent memory.

Unfortunately, the majority of the films problems lie within the script. While it's evident what type of film Braff wanted to make here, he stuffed more material into the movie than there needed to be. The film runs close to 2 hours and there is about 15 minutes of footage that could have been left on the cutting room floor. There are two subplots in the film involving Josh Gad's and Kate Hudson's characters. While the subplot involving Josh Gad's certainly could have been minimized a bit, it serves a purpose to the main plot. The subplot involving Kate Hudson's on the other hand, serves little to no purpose and could have easily been cut from the film. There are also several moments throughout the film set in Braff's characters imagination in which he imagines himself as heroic warrior within a Sci-Fi world. These moments are very brief and distracting and never amount to anything. During these scenes, the film begins to drag and feel dull. The strongest moments in the film are the interactions between Zach Braff's character and his family. The film would have been more enjoyable if the film had focused on these moments for the majority of the running time. Also while I did enjoy the plot of the film, it doesn't tread any new ground that we haven't seen in other films before.

While I certainly wish that Wish I Was Here was better, I enjoyed a lot more of it than I didn't. If you are a fan of Garden State this is certainly worth checking out, but don't expect it to reach the same caliber that film did.

6583593,5,B00MJDV0LY,Best movie I've seen in a long time. I love Zach Braff! Can't go wrong with Kate Hudson and Mandy Patinkin either!,1426982400,,114,4.2272727272727275
6583594,4,B00MJDV0LY,"Aiden Bloom (Zach Braff) is an out of work actor. His wife (Kate Hudson) supports the family with a job she pretends to like. Meanwhile Aiden's dad is dying from cancer. Finances are forcing their two kids to leave the private Orthodox school. Aiden also has an engineer brother who is an underachiever. He doesn't talk to dad.

There are of course other issues. The film is a dramedy that deals with life, death, mending fences, and ideas about God. It is one of those heart warming films that I got deja vu watching. (I checked Amazon twice to see if I had already seen this film and written a review on it.) It is heavily theme driven. Would make for a decent family film once they deleted two scenes and bleeped out all the swearing.

6583595,3,B00MJDV0LY,"Wish I Was Here is a Kickstarter funded film that could have been better, and I think has rated a bit higher as some of the reviewers on this site by their own admissions helped fund it. Zach Braff pretty much just brings JD from Scrubs back to the screen with his character Aidan Bloom, who is pretty much the same character less the medical degree and successful hospital career. Instead in this one Braff plays an unsuccessful ageing wannabe actor character who hasn't had an acting gig for a while, with his last being a dandruff commercial a long while ago. He's got a young family and wife who financially supports his pretty much failed dream, she pays the bills and feeds the kids. Interestingly we also see Jim Parson as a rival also in his forties struggling to get a break actor, who we also need to try and forget while watching is on one of the most lucrative and successful sitcoms of the past couple of decades. Scrubs fans will also enjoy a cameo by Donald Faison at a car dealership. Homeland, Dead Like Me and well a heap of other TV shows he's been on fans will also enjoy seeing Mandy Patinkin who plays the disappointed in his sons father of Aidan and his brother Noah (Josh Gad), probably most recognisable from an episode of Modern Family where he played Kenneth, but kids might know his voice as Olaf in Frozen. There's a fair bit of swearing in this one, a self pleasure dropped pants scene, sexual harassment and other things that probably mean those kids won't be watching this for a fair few years yet though.

This is a film dealing with terminal illness and a sort of reflection on am I doing what I should be with my life and responsibilities by not just Zach Braff's character but the other main ones as well. This film should be a real tear jerker at times but unfortunately falls flat and fails to even make the eyes water due to the unlikeability of Braff and Patinkin's characters. Aidan due to him being a bit of deadbeat and happy to let his wife work a miserable job just so he can keep after his dream, he doesn't even think about getting a non acting part time or casual job. Gabe, because well he's just a nasty individual who likens his young granddaughter to a prostitute when she comes to visit him in the hospital amongst other things. You really don't mind that he's dying, knowing he won't be a big loss to the world. The better and more likeable characters are played by Kate Hudson and Joey King who play his wife and young daughter. King delivers the only real emotional scenes in the film where you the viewer are actually moved. You can't fault that young actresses performance at all.

Wish I Was Here is watchable once, but not something you're going to likely ever want to give a second viewing to, with nothing really memorable that you'll think about again once you've watched a couple more films. A shame really if like me you're a huge fan of Zach Braff.",1426982400,,2914,4.444859813084112

6583626,4,B00MJDV0LY,"Director, star and co-writer Zach Braff took a lot of criticism for this film, which in some ways is a cloying follow-up to his much admired ""Garden State"" from 10 years earlier.  Some of the criticism was for the movie itself.  And it certainly doesn't break new ground here.  But the other criticism was for his, some would say, selfishly clamoring for funding via crowdfunding using Kickstarter.  Well, that did break new ground.  Enough financial ground to get the movie made.  It certainly is a labor of love, with Zach's brother Adam the other writer.

Zach plays Aidan Bloom, a 30-something would be actor who hasn't worked since a dandruff commercial.  The family is supported financially by wife Sarah (Kate Hudson) who has a desk job at a public utility.  The two children, Grace (excellent Joey King) and Tucker (Pierce Gagnon) are going to a private Jewish school, financed by Aidan's father Gabe (Mandy Patinkin).  Aidan also has a brother, Noah (Josh Gad) who lives a hermit-like existence in a trailer overlooking the Pacific Ocean.  Noah's primary goal in life is to make award winning costumes for Comic-Con and get into the knickers of his next door neighbor.

Gabe's financial support must be curtailed after he develops a fast growing cancer.  While the film certainly has its moments that include some excellent dialog, most of that dialog is one-way and not conversational.  For example, Hudson doesn't get much to do beyond her character clearly being too good for her husband.  But she gets a nice scene, softly lecturing the dying Gabe about his lack of respect for his sons.  Another scene features the 14 year old Grace urging her uncle Noah to return from Comic-Con to be at his father's side.

There are enough scenes of remorse, regret, recollection, resolve and restitution to move a tear to all but the most hardened souls.  My take is that if you are cynical film watcher, this movie isn't for you.  On the other hand, if your life isn't perfect and have unresolved family issues, you might find something of yourself in these characters.  There is plenty of humor and catharsis to make this a watchable movie.  And keep an eye out for Joey King.  She's something special.",1421971200,,2205,4.824

6583691,5,B00MJDV0LY,"What I liked the most about this movie was how much like real life it was like. No fanfare, no special effects, just real characters struggling with issues and questions that we can all relate to one way or another. Like for example struggling financially, struggling to try to decide if we should pursue our dreams and hopes or settle for a dreaded job most of us have because others depend on us, and our relationships with family members. Question how good our parenting has been, what is there after death, and if there isn't anything why and what are we doing here on earth, and what makes us happy. And most importantly what makes a hero a hero? Someone in a comic book or all of us everyday in our own ways and the expectations others have of us? We have an idealized view of what a ""great/good"" person should be like and we don't realize that we all are in our own little ways while struggling through this lifetime we have here on earth. I felt this movie touched on all these topics subtlety just by showing us a regular family. Things that we might look over while living ours. And it seems that sometimes people might not want movies that make them think introspective, but just something that is disconnected and entertains. Honestly, I think it was a better movie than Garden State.",1417564800,,1296,4.495762711864407

6583696,5,B00MJDV0LY,"Zach Braff does not release enough movies. There's such a delay between.

Someone made a comment about this being like other Braff movies. That's what I hoped. It is similar in terms of looking at relationships and events within a household and extended family.

I like the middle-class details. You teach your kid how to swim in a neighbor's pool because you don't belong to a country club or one of those highly competitive kids swim clubs. Your appliances are not new-fangled and the garage is messy. The oldest member of the family is a grouchy grandpa who gave up on charm decades ago. The most devout family member is a sincere pre-teen. And when someone in the household is stressed and needs a massage, you present them with money from the dollar jar in the kitchen.

People don't talk much about the transition in life that occurs when parents die, but it's real and sometimes difficult.  So here we have a movie that deals with all the dysfunctions that a family can generate, and everyone emerges better and stronger, with happy endings for the brothers.  Kate Hudson excels in her role (and I was even struck by the fact that she's getting prettier as she ages).  Favorite quote:  Mandy Patinkin (the dying father) to Kate (his daughter in law): ""Someday you will be a great matriarch"".  Kate: ""I already am."" - pause - ""Well, trying to be.""

6583742,4,B00MJDV0LY,"Zach Braff said this was a comedy.  It certainly has a lot of funny stuff, but thematically it is certainly a drama.  It was the same with his previous stint in the directors chair, Garden State.  Like Garden State, I really liked this, even though this one didn't have Natalie Portman bouncing around.  It has some excellent performance from Braff, Kate Hudson, Joey King, Josh Gad, and Mandy Patinkin.  Other cast members include Jim Parsons, Ashley Greene, Donald Faison, Alexander Chaplin, and Allan Rich.

  Braff plays Aidan Bloom, an out-of-work actor whose wife (Hudson) provides for the family.  His father (Patinkin) pays for the kids (Joey King and a little boy I had no use for) to attend a private Hebrew school.  When his father has a cancer relapse the money is needed for treatment.  Rather than send the kids to public school, Hudson suggests that Braff homeschool them.

  Theres a whole lot more to it than that.  Theres a lot of introspection as multiple people have to face their own fears, desires, and regrets.  Just like with Garden State, Zach lacks a bit of subtlety, and he does embrace a few cliches.  Regardless, he does it with grace and aplomb.  The critics were divided, but I liked it a lot.  I wish I had seen it in the theater.  Also, the soundtrack was excellent.  Braff has good taste in music.",1415836800,,1331,4.675324675324675

Aiden begins to reexamine his relationships with his wife, kids and father when Gabe tells him he has cancer. For a while now I have been saying that Hollywood is out of ideas. All that is being released are re-makes or sequels because I guess the studios figure the more stuff blows up the better the movie. This movie is a perfect example of why they are wrong. This movie only has great acting and a emotional and real story that you can't turn away from. This movie was part of the Kickstarter funding project. That should tell the studios something when people will pay over $3 million just to get the movie made because of the people and idea. All my preaching aside the movie is very good and I really enjoyed it. The acting is perfect and the movie just feels real which really helps it to achieve the emotion it is going for.

6583796,4,B00MJDV0LY,"I like many others reviewing, loved Garden State, and was excited about this film. I had to wait to see the Digital release because the limited theatrical release never made it to a theater near me. After seeing Wish I Was Here, I came away somewhat moved. The film is very ambitious, and almost to a fault. It is about life. The relationships you create, the relationships you destroy, the memories you make, the people you meet, finding your purpose, pursuing (and ultimately setting aside) your dreams and dealing with the inevitable end of life. Braff attempts to explore all of this in just under 2 hours. It is a deep, personal movie and seems to be a very polarizing one. Many people either love it or they absolutely hate it.

I for one think it is fantastic. The overall storyline is applicable to everyone and the movie flows well. There was maybe one scene that felt out of place, but overall every scene has a part to play and is important in the overall message of the movie. There is a few cameos that will make you smile-of which the trailer will spoil, but I won't reveal. Overall the acting was top notch, especially by Patinkin, Hudson, Gad and little Joey King. There is one scene in particular with Hudson and Patinkin that is probably one of the best acted scenes I have seen since the interrogation scene between Daines & Lewis on Season 2 of Homeland.

One minor quibble with the movie is the soundtrack...do not get me wrong I purchased this soundtrack the day it was released and it is fantastic! However in the movie the soundtrack was almost a distraction. A scene would play out like normal and once it got near the end of the scene, when the actors had a few lines remaining the soundtrack would begin in and kind of take away from the movie. That is how I felt anyhow....the only part where I thought the soundtrack added to the movie was when ""Heavenly Father"" by Bon Iver was playing.

Overall I would encourage anyone to see this movie...I actually watched it with my father and older brother and it was an amazing experience.",1414022400,,2059,4.529569892473118

6583810,3,B00MJDV0LY,"I love movies. Not the big hyped-up Blockbuster movies that everyone rushes to watch on premier night with their best friend, grandmother, and dog. Not the type where you sit mindlessly, staring at the screen while shoving handfuls of overly-salted, heavily-buttered popcorn into your mouth.
I like the movies that you have to search for: the ones that only come out in select theaters overcrowded with hipsters wearing skinny jeans and thick-rimmed glasses that most likely have fake lenses. Thats not to say some of these movies don't make it big, but they definitely aren't the ones that earn millions in the box office and have robots and aliens blowing up futuristic cities. So, when a friend sent me the link on Facebook to the trailer for the film Wish I Was Here, I knew it was something I had to watch because I hadnt even heard about it though mainstream television.
Wish I was Here is a comedy/drama that came out this past July on the 25th. It was directed by Zach Braff: the funny, dorky guy from the TV series Scrubs. However, in the indie movie world, he is more famous for his role as both the director and lead actor in Garden State. Garden State, which came out in theaters in 2004, is one of my favorite movies.
Needless to say, knowing Wish I Was Here had the same director and lead actor as Garden State made me ecstatic about seeing it, so ecstatic that I must have watched the trailer at least thirty times before going to watch it. I even downloaded the soundtrack on iTunes to pump myself up on the car ride there.
I had to drive forty-five minutes from home to the closest viewing, which was at a run-down mall theater. This is the point where I wish I could say the commute was worth it, but that would be lying.
It pains me to criticize a movie which had every element I love. There was romance, jokes for those with a bone-dry sense of humor, and quirky touches like Zach Braffs character running around in what looked like a space suit from some video game.
But while the movie was visually appealing, there was something about the story line that failed to capture my interest. In fact, I cant even tell you what the plot was really about, even though I sat through the entire 106 minutes.
Thats right. I was so positive that this movie was going to make my Top 10 list that I didn't want to miss a single moment. Therefore, I ignored my bodys incessant signals to use the ladies room and kept sipping on my Would you like to make that a large? fountain drink.
While the movie fell a short of my standards, the soundtrack was incredible. Its like every one of my favorite artists came together to produce the perfect music compilation. The thought of listening to Bon Iver, The Weepies, and The Shins through the loud theater speakers is almost reason enough to see the movie again.
If you liked the movie Garden State, youll probably enjoy this movie simply because you already have an affinity for delving into the mind of Zack Braff. And if you're a fan of indie singer/songwriter music, you will undoubtedly love the soundtrack.",1409616000,12,3063,4.52072072072072
6583811,5,B00MJDV0LY,"Loved this movie, it was extremely personal. I was one of the backers from Kickstarter and couldn't be happier that I was able to support (even in the smallest way) this film being made. The acting on all accounts was great. A very heavy movie that still makes you laugh and appreciate your family.",1408924800,,298,4.537037037037037
6583812,4,B00MJDV0LY,"Theres few actors that I can comfortably watch suffer. Not necessarily in the way you may be thinking, like being harmed, but more in a mid-life crisis type sense. Maybe in a drama that concerns a family member dying or a couple thats having trouble raising their kids, something thats familiar. To me, it always seems a bit too cliche and something Ive seen time and time again. Its boring.

But every now and then theres a movie that may deal with issues Ive seen before but since it stars one of those people, I don't mind as much. They elevate the film to a level that grabs my attention that it wouldnt have had before. One of those key people is Zach Braff.

His name may not ring a bell right away but you may know him from his directorial debut Garden State (which he also wrote and starred in) that caused quite a stir at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival, and has now become a cult hit. Its a delightful little movie that is certainly better than Wish I Was Here, his latest venture, but they share an undeniable aura of sweetness and authenticity. You can tell that hes coming from a genuine place and drawing directly from his own experiences.

And thats the main reason why I give his new movie, flaws and all, a pass. It follows a father struggling with chasing his dream and trying to keep his spirits up as bad news continues to pile on, teaching his kids about moving forward in life. Its a movie for regular people. And though it doesnt succeed in every theme it tries to get across, and may try too hard to be funny, it still moved me and is undoubtedly more emotionally rich than most films out now.",1408406400,2,1617,4.347682119205298
6583813,5,B00MJDV0LY,"Zach Braff had a tiny little masterpiece on his hands with 2004s Garden State. It was the kind of rare movie that got better with each viewing. Wish I Was Here, his Kickstarter-funded follow-up, arrives about a decade later.

It has been the subject of a lot of misplaced criticism, because it tends to drive through similar narrative traffic as Braffs previous film. But, if you liked Garden State as much as I did, this is hardly a problem.

The film follows Aidan (Braff), a struggling actor who has been encouraged his whole life to follow his dreams. He hasn't had a real acting job in some time now. His wife (Kate Hudson) works a crummy office job, and never quite has the courage to push him in the direction of a more real and permanent job. After being told his father Saul (Mandy Patinkin)s cancer is back, and he likely does not have long to live, Aidan begins to ponder the meaning of life, and tries to figure out what is most important in that big mystery called life.

The questions Wish I Was Here raises about life are really relevant to just about anybody. And this is what keeps the film from feeling self-indulgent and vain. These are issues we all deal with. What should we prioritize most in our lives? What is more important than being happy? What will we regret about our lives when were about to die? All solid questions, and yet, nothing remarkably original either.

""Wish I Was Here"" is basically just a film about a mans midlife crisis, in the same way ""Garden State"" was about a similar mans quarter-life crisis. Both deal with characters who are forced to come to grips with their own mortality when facing the impending death of a loved one. But, both of these characters are fairly easy to like.

Like Garden State, its the supporting actors who really steal the show here. Mandy Patinkin is great as the father who has been a jerk for so long, but simply needs some tenderness when he comes face-to-face with death. Kate Hudson is also better here than shes been since Almost Famous. She acquired a stigma for playing dumb blonde roles, and its nice to see that she can play a real and relatable woman, and do it quite well.

The third act of Wish I Was Here, of course, packs quite the emotional wallop. Its really quite a funny film, but you're likely to cry as well as laugh. Many cliches about death and dying are on display in Wish I Was Here, but I can forgive those, because the themes stay very real and very true-to-life. Was anyone expecting this to be truly original?

""Wish I Was Here"" is basically ""Garden State,"" 10 years later, and I think thats all right. Both are humor-filled movies that bring on the waterworks when you least expect it. Both are gorgeously filmed and both have some really great music. Both are profound, deep and kind of life-affirming. Both are tiny classics in their own right.

6583814,5,B00MJDV0LY,"Some films defy easy categorization.  Wish I Was Here, directed by Zach Braff from a screenplay by Zach Braff and brother Adam J. Braff, is one of those films.  On the surface it's a comedy, but under the surface it deals with a lot of serious issues that almost everyone has to deal with in their lives:  family, identity, careers, fears, dreams and dealing with the choices we - and those we love - make in life.

Aidan Bloom (Zach Braff) is an aspiring actor, at 35 years old still struggling to get established.  He's married with two kids, but despite his lack of success life isn't that bad as his wife Sarah (Kate Hudson) supports the family with her job and his father Gabe (Mandy Patinkin) is paying for the kids' schooling at a private orthodox Jewish school. Or it wasn't that bad until Gabe's cancer suddenly takes a turn for the terminal worse and he can no longer pay for the kids' tuition, forcing Aidan to suddenly have to deal with, well, his entire life and who he is, as a son, as a husband, as a father, and as a person.

We quickly begin to see that Aidan, however genial and well-meaning he is on the surface, has been less than stellar in any of those aspects of his life. The woefully neglected back yard and pool we see behind his house serves as a visual metaphor for his life. When Gabe chides Aidan for letting Sarah support the family while he pursues his fruitless acting career, Aidan defensively protests that Sarah is ""living her dream"" in her job.  Whereupon the film cuts to Sarah, working as a harried number cruncher for the LA Water Department where she has to share an office with a boorish and grossly sexually inappropriate co-worker, a job she cannot quit because she is the sole bread-winner in the family.

Aidan's first response is to try to apply for charity to the school's director, a no-nonsense Rabbi Twersky (Allan Rich) who isn't about to put up with Aidan's childish attempt to avoid responsibility and bluntly shuts him down:

Rabbi Twersky:  ""Get a job.""
Aidan:  ""But what about my dream? I mean, doesn't God believe in my pursuit of happiness?""
Rabbi Twersky: ""No. That's the Declaration of Independence. Thomas Jefferson believed in your happiness. God wants you to provide for your family.""

Aidan's willful obliviousness is further nailed later when even Sarah pushes him to get some kind of job to pay for the kids' tuition and he weakly protests ""What about following my dream?"" To which a thoroughly weary Sarah asks ""When did this relationship become solely about supporting _your_ dream?""

What works best in Wish I Was Here is that there are no magical Hollywood solutions to any of the family's problems. Aidan's attempts to deal with the various situations facing him are, in the beginning at least, as inept as they are rooted in self-centered denial. But he does try, and in the end sometimes it's the attempt that matters. Sometimes, in spite of ourselves, we stumble towards a kind of wisdom that, even if it doesn't completely solve our problems, makes them bearable, and we can discover possibilities that we didn't know were there.

6583815,4,B00MJDV0LY,"""Wish I Was Here"" (2014 release; 115 min.) brings the story of Aidan Bloom (played by Zach Braff), a 30-something unemployed actor-wannabe with a beautiful wife (played by Kate Hudson) and two young children. As the movie opens, we see the family gathering for breakfast, and Aidan driving his kids to the Jewish private school they attend (and which it turns out is paid for by Aidan's dad). It's not long before we learn that Aidan's dad no longer can pay the tuition because of the recurrence of a malignant cancer that requires all of his financial resources. In a parallel story, we also meet Aidan's brother Noah, who is estranged from his dad. To tell you much more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is Zach Braff's second turn at starring-producing-directing a movie, after ""Garden State"" a decade ago. As was the case then, ""Wish I Was There"" is a very personal and subjective movie. Braff faces (and addresses) life's big topics, mostly about how to make the most of a life that flies by seemingly so quickly. In that sense, the movie is very melancholic (but never sentimental), in particular the second hour of the movie becomes very introspective. I happened to love it, and for me the movie became stronger and stronger as it played out. Second, there are some amazing acting performances in this movie. Let's start with Kate Hudson, who not only looks radiant (has she ever looked better?), but who also happens to bring her best role in, literally, YEARS. Kudos also to Joey King as the 12 yr. old daughter Grace, and Josh Gad as Noah. Third, much was made about the music featured in ""Garden State"" (""The Shins will change your life!""), and here also, there is a delicious soundtrack with, yes, a new song from the Shins (a good sounding ""So Now What""), but the songs that really strike/reflect the mood of the movie come from Bon Iver, the Weepies, and the Head and the Heart. Last but certainly not least, in the movie's end titles, Braff specifically thanks the ""46,250 backers on Kickstarter"" and then lists several hundreds of them (not sure on what basis those were listed). Indeed, more than half the movie's reported $5 million budget came from funds raised on Kickstarter.

I had been looking forward to seeing this movie so I went right away when it opened some weeks ago here in Cincinnati. The early evening screening I saw this at was not particularly well attended, somewhat to my surprise. Maybe the nice summer weather had something to do with it. Regardless, if you are in the mood for a deeply personal movie that isn't shy about looking at some of life's bigger issues, you cannot go wrong with ""Wish I Was Here"". Bottom line: make amends, hug your kids, TODAY, and tell'em you love them. Check out ""Wish I Was Here"" in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray, you won't regret it.

This film is fine if you literally have nothing else to do for 2 hours.  He again uses music and every single director's trick in the book but it just falls flat and feels like forced emotion.  It isn't worth the money.",1523664000,,333,4.171875

8672761,3,B00MJDV0LY,"I wanted to like this movie. I saw an interview with Zach Braff where he talked about how much of himself and his life he put into the movie, and it was savaged by the critics, not so much for content but because he used Kickstarter to raise some of the money for the film. Don't they realize that the only way you can tell the story YOU want to tell is by financing it yourself, and if you don't have all the money you need and your fans are willing to support you, I say more power to you.

That said, even though Zach Braff is a little too old to be considered a millennial, I am really sick of stories of the man-child who expects everyone else to cater to him so that he can follow his dream. If you're going to do that, DON'T get married and DON'T have children until you have followed your dream and either found success or accepted failure. In the movie, he is a failure as an actor, he is a failure as a homeschooling parent, and he is a failure as a brother. The only role he is even moderately successful in is as a son, and even then, his father thinks of him as a failure because he isn't providing for his family.

There are a lot of good performances in this movie. Kate Hudson's performance is deep and moving, as is Mandy Patinkin's. Zach Braff - well, no matter what film or TV show he's in, he's Zach Braff. I liked him in Scrubs. He was okay in Garden State. He was okay in this movie. I did not particularly admire his character, but I'm sure it was as true to life as he could make it. I have to admire him for showing what it's like to be an actor, although we all know that he was not the failure that the character in this movie was.

Three stars from me means ""watchable movie, nothing special, wouldn't watch again.""",1511049600,3,1743,4.105571847507331
