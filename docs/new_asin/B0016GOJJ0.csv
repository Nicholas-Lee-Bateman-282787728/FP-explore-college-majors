8344283,5,B0016GOJJ0,"This is the first book I have read about mental health issues that I could really relate to (I have read quite a few). I felt validated that depression really is an illness and that it does affect the way I think, work, live and act each day. It was so easy to read with the author's great sense of humour lightening the weighty topic. I would highly recommend it to someone with depression or someone who knows someone with depression.",1507593600,,436,4.395061728395062
8344284,5,B0016GOJJ0,A great read about a difficult subject. To open up like this is brave and welcome. Highly recommend reading this as it gives great insight with great wit. We all need to laugh and smile regardless of our circumstances and this book will certainly make you laugh and smile. Pauls style of writing makes it a very easy read taking from day to day thing what next.,1506816000,,361,4.402985074626866
8344285,5,B0016GOJJ0,"Paul Green writes from the heart about his depression, but does it with so much wit and humor, it's uplifting and delightful. Each day he offers insights about mental illness and wonderful descriptions of all the fascinating places he's lived. Paul's book shows us how writing can help us heal, or at least cope with mental illness. He also reminds us that people suffering from depression and other mental disorders are often too ashamed to ask for help, and if they do, there may not be affordable care available to them. An entertaining and important book!",1506556800,,559,4.833333333333333
8344286,5,B0016GOJJ0,This should be in every doctor's waiting room. It had me chuckling all the way through. It is not quite Anne Frank's diary but it is an enjoyable way to pass some time.,1506556800,,168,4.121212121212121
8344287,4,B0016GOJJ0,"Performances are praiseworthy. Dancing queen and extremely beautiful Madhuri has carried this movie on her shoulders alone though she has got able support from others. This is the only movie in which the dancing and action talent of Javed Jafferey has got ample footage. He is awesome and so is the ever-in his-controls, Jackie Shroff. Laxmikant Berde has generated good laughters. 100 Days (or Sau Din) is a very good suspense-thriller with the mystery remaining unresolved till the very climax. Good narrative, good performances, good music, good comedy. A perfect entertainment spanning more than two and half hours, full of suspense, thrill and chill. Strongly recommended for all in general and mystery fans in particular.",1302393600,,727,5.3304347826086955
