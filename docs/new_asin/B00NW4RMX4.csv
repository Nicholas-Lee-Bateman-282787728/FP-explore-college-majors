8680585,5,B00NW4RMX4,"The basic plot is simple: a detective who is unable to show any compassion to people who committed crimes and even treats suspected criminals badly, emotionally and physically, because of how his father treated his mother, discovers that his wife, who he loves dearly committed a crime. Yet, despite the simplicity of the plot, the details of the plot, the actors and their acting, the often humorous events that occur in the police station along with one that is pathetic, adds suspense, turn the film into a delight to watch, and causes us to be interested with the developments. The film is based on a successful play by Sidney Kingsley.
Kirk Douglas is this detective. We see him acting in a gross fashion in his treatment of several people. He has an especial hatred, even disgust against a particular abortionist. Both the abortionist and his lawyer tell Douglas' boss that Douglas is mistreating the abortionist because of Douglas' wife.
Will this revelation change Douglas' attitude to criminals? Will it affect his relationship with his wife? Will it prompt him to change his attitude to several other criminals who appeared before him that day?",1494115200,,1154,4.984455958549223
