2794824,5,B000OH1DAK,"This was a very well acted film, The lead character was too young to realize the horrors he would encounter in those mines, both physical and mental. Way to brutal for even those times, the issues were handled somewhat well, or rather glossed over.",1235606400,5,248,4.659090909090909
2794825,4,B000OH1DAK,"Acla is a young son in a large poverty-stricken family of sulfur miners in depression-era Italy.  While there is a lot of sexual innuendo and some full frontal male nudity, this is not a sex story.  Rather, it is about doing what you have to do to survive horrible poverty.  Whether you are an old man or a young boy.",1233187200,26,317,4.25
2794826,5,B000OH1DAK,I've been looking for a copy of this movie for a long time.  I'm glad I found it here in Amazon.,1220832000,2,96,3.5714285714285716
2794827,4,B000OH1DAK,"This film was inspired by true events. It's an unflinching exploration of social mores and disturbing sexual practices. It exposes the endless cycle of religious hypocracy and poverty that allowed it to sacrifice generations of children.
Those who toiled in the sulfur mines had no access to their wives and family for 24/6. Both men and boys shared a communal sleeping chamber where the weak were subject to the spector of sexual abuse on and off the job.
The only thing that kept this film from getting 5-stars from me was the dialogue. At times, the dialogue was stiff and it seemed as if the actors were reciting their lines. I would highly recommend this movie for viewing for those who want to understand why conditions that the film presented could exist.",1194739200,46,762,4.78030303030303
2794828,5,B000OH1DAK,"ACL&Agrave;'S DESCENT INTO FLORISTELLA

(Italian, 1992) Director: Aurelio Grimaldi. Cast: Francesco Cusimano, Tony Sperandeo, Luigi Maria Burruano, Lucia Sardo. Color. Running time: 86 minutes. Italian with English subtitles. Letterbox format. Unrated.

Set in Sicily in the 1930s, this haunting motion picture chronicles a major turning point in the life of Acl&agrave;, a feisty 12-year-old sold by his destitute parents to work in the underground sulfur mines of Floristella. Repeatedly beaten by his brutal ""owner"" and tormented by the ever-present specter of rape and sexual abuse, Acl&agrave; attempts to escape, with dire consequences for both himself and his family. Hailed by film festival critics throughout Europe and Canada, ACL&Agrave; is an uncompromising indictment of an Italy at once beautiful and spiritually desolate. Nudity, strong language, provocative subject matter.",1159660800,7,889,5.9921259842519685
2794829,5,B000OH1DAK,"This is an interesting story that I stumbled on some years ago. It only has become available on DVD fairly recently. It tells the story of a young boy from an impoverished, large Italian family whose  only income is from working in the sulfur mines. He is sold into slavery to one of the other mine workers and is forced to spend his days and nights in the mine with only one day in seven to spend with his family on the outside. It tells of his interaction with the other miners and his wish to leave and go see the ocean. He thinks that is the only way he can get out of the mine and away from his hopeless situation. It does not have a happy, uplifting ending but is an example of how those who find themselves in dire straights lean to cope and find some happiness were they are and with what they have. It is also the story shattered hope. It is Italian with English sub-titles. It will be in my permanent collection. As disturbing as it is, it is well worth the time and effort to watch.",1435795200,3,993,4.1450777202072535

2794831,2,B000OH1DAK,The quality of this DVD was dreadful it looked like it had been copied over and over which is a pity because the film portrays a very serious subject of child slavery in the sulfur mines good film terrible copy.,1424044800,,211,4.3

2794833,1,B000OH1DAK,"According to the packaging, this was ""digitally remastered"" and I now wonder if that's a term with no meaning. The video is on an angle, the subtitles are burned in, blocky and unreadable.

As to the movie, I was very much hoping to replace the high quality AVI I downloaded with a purchased product. However, I'll keep the AVI I downloaded to watch, and I'll keep this horrendous DVD as a lesson, a reminder to never purchase from this seller or distributor again.

Good movie, but awful DVD. Shame on anyone selling this, and much shame on those responsible for the dishonest packaging.",1394668800,6,588,4.699029126213592

2794835,5,B000OH1DAK,"An excellent movie. Although there were some scenes I didn't particularly like (the physical abuse for example), the movie was based on actual events in this man's childhood, and for some reasons movies based on actual facts tends to appear more real to me, which I like in movies.",1382227200,2,281,4.755102040816326

2794837,3,B000OH1DAK,This portrait  of the poverty in Italy during war was really  touching adn show how humans can be animals under such enviroment.,1376784000,,128,4.7727272727272725
2794838,3,B000OH1DAK,"Very disappointing.  The background information is correct about the shocking sale of a boy's labor
for several years in a sulfur mine, during the 1930s.  The nudity in this DVD is a historic fact for
labor in such a mine due to the high temperatures and humidity - just a waist string and a flap in the
front to protect the crouch.  In the Mediterranean regions, pedophile behaviors have quite a tragic
history for boys sold into indentured servitude in a mine where they are at the behest of other men.
The conclusion is quite succinct to emphasize, Acla, like so many other boys sold into indenture, had
no future.

The DVD arrived with a cracked, damage cover.  In addition due to the damage of the cover, the DVD
was rendered defective.",1372896000,,741,4.583333333333333

2794841,4,B000OH1DAK,"I was greatly influenced by the povertry  and cruel working conditions by the men and children in the sulfur mines. Some of the scenes were blurred in the mine but, altogether, this a powerful film.",1337731200,,198,4.6571428571428575
2794842,4,B000OH1DAK,"This movie was surprisingly well done for it's age and unskilled actors. Don't get me wrong the acting was far from perfect but the message and image of suffering the movie was meant to portray is well conveyed. It leaves you feeling sorry for the people forced into legal slavery, just kids really. This kind of thing still happens in the world today in different places in the world and it's just heartbreaking to think about. This is a great movie to get people thinking about how we as hungry consumers actually aquire our products, from crude material, to what we see when we purchase it.",1331424000,,593,4.60377358490566

2794848,4,B000OH1DAK,"This movie gives a little bit of something to dislike about these people! It isn't about man/boy love or even gay love -- there's damn little love in it at all! We witness one violent act after the other -- rapes, beatings -- you name it -- selfish, horny, frustrated boys and men and woman.
It seems like I wouldn't really care for it for in the end it did the job -- it made one re-consider the way humans can treat each other most especially it reminds us of how some places in the world place a value on our children that we could never imagine.",1238025600,11,549,4.140186915887851

Not much to be crying for if money were saved by deploying a free screening in Itslian, because apart some nudity nothing backs customer's expectations.

An extraorbitary Amazon price for DVD not being delivered is a jock sustained with English subtitles, perhaps.

Save your money.",1437609600,,438,5.411764705882353
