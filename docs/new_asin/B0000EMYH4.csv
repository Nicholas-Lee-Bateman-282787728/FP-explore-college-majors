8002241,5,B0000EMYH4,"My granddaughter learned ""Wheels"" during Tot-Time.  When I first saw the Chapter I was worried that Wheels on the Bus was not included.  All three dvd's are built around the Wheels song.  My granddaughter loves the DVD.  Three DVDs and lot's of fun for a great price!",1367798400,,267,4.617021276595745

The service is great, we received the item on time.",1285372800,,215,3.909090909090909
8002244,5,B0000EMYH4,"However, owners of other DVDs in this series should be aware that there is only one unique story on this dvd (Row, Row Row your boat). We have all of these DVDs - both the UK and US versions. I do not think Jane Kaczmarek is nearly as good a narrator as Dawn French, but the voices of the characters in the stories are the same, and these are wonderful first DVDs for kids.

Each story is about 8-10 minutes long and based on a nursery rhyme. There are two songs in each story, one the original nursery rhyme and one a new song that fits with the story. The intro/closing song is always THe Wheels on the bus.

These are great videos but if you already have the other UK and US discs, you could give this one a miss.",1163116800,,716,4.070921985815603
