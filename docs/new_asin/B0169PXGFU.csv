7464961,4,B0169PXGFU,"Being that this was a story that in the original Teen Titans show was multiple episodes, saying that there is a time issue again is obvious.  Especially since we are introducing several new characters.  Attention to the two main issues, Damian learning how play nice with others (the whole reason he was banished to the Teen Titan in the first place) and Raven's very real issues with her father, Trigon, (the entire plot for the movie).  Everyone else was sort of sidelined, though Starfire did a quick run down of everyone's issues for Damian.
And I have no problem with Starfire.  She is older, probably in her twenties like Nightwing, and in charge, so having her being motherly was just fine.  I don't know what ditsy lines some other reviewers were referring to.  She has one or two moments where she reminds the audience that English is not her first language and Earth is not her birthland.  Compared to how often that happened in the TV show it nicely reflected how long she has lived on Earth.
I also loved how they did the Teen Titans.  They actually had them getting out of their uniforms and hanging out in their civ clothes.  It was also funny to see how everyone but Damian could get into uniform with a snap of their fingers while he had to run back to the car to get his stuff.  Makes Blue Beetles comment to Damian about him bringing his sword seem a little selfish.  Of course he had to bring his gear with him.  And Starfire doing the Sailor Moon routine for her uniform change got a snort.  I also liked how when they were out of uniform they went by their regular names.  I had no idea that Starfire's actual name was Kori.",1526774400,,1645,4.44

7464980,5,B0169PXGFU,"of all the teen titans villains, dc picked one of the best that both groups would be hard put to defeat. This made a great tale. The characters were well done. The stark no outline style fits the darkness of the story. Its not derivative. Rotoscoping the clouds worked better than cgi. Its not overdone with demonic possession graphics so it doesnt detract from the story &  not too gory. Tell dc animation studios we need more teen titans stories,even original stories not in comics but good tales & not teen titans go!",1521936000,,520,4.591397849462366
7464981,3,B0169PXGFU,"Movie starts out pretty entertaining I was involved in the plot up until the carnival scene with that idiotic montage that just felt to go on forever, not helping is the generic rock/punk? song that plays. Once that crappy, unnecessarily drawn out scene is over it's followed up with more generic music as two characters play a ""Dance Dance Revolurtion"" type game.

I get it, ""Teen"" Titans, but seriously? After that, I just lost interest in the film, it was just generic fight scene after the next. Total filler. I was really intrigued with Trigon being the main focus, as I've already seen & read that story arc a million times over it seems like at this point.

I liked the voice acting and the animation was consistently good! Thank God for that. I was really worried that Blue Beetle would be a generic ""Taco Bell"" type character, but he only used one Spanish word as opposed to ""We need him to say one Spanish word per line, so people don't forget he's the ethnic one!""

I'd recommend waiting to stream this for free through a stream service or try to catch it on TV, but don't buy unless you are an absolutely die-hard Titans (mostly Raven) fan.

Someone please fire or get Sim Liu off directing these potential classic films.",1520640000,,1233,4.5656108597285066

7464988,5,B0169PXGFU,"I don't like super hero stuff. Or at least I didnt. Up until recently when I was introduced to the Tick (old one).
I'm older and know this film is directed towards young adults/ teens.
I laughed a few times. It not meant for older (25+) people, but it doesn't discount that its audience is going to be older, either.
I think its something a family could enjoy.
I would have loved it as a kid.

Overall I really liked the film and wished more stuff made me feel the way this one does.
Not even in just super hero genre in general.
Its a decent and fun film that doesn't push the (Diversity/ anti-white) agenda so hard. I like all the colorful characters.

7464991,2,B0169PXGFU,"While the idea /sounds/ good, the implementation doesn't work -- for me.
For someone actually in the target audience (kids, perhaps early teenagers), it may work considerably better.
It would probably play better for someone who actually /liked/ watching the Justice League -- I just don't seem to enjoy their movies.
But, really, the Titans live in a building shaped like a giant T with what looks like a good 50 stories and there are -- what? 5? -- of them. What's the rest of the building used for?",1515024000,,501,4.640449438202247

7464993,4,B0169PXGFU,"Justice League vs Teen Titans is another movie in the revamped DC DTV series where, for better or worse, have decided to keep most of their released movies under the same continuity. This movie is both a sequel to Justice League: Throne of Atlantis and Batman vs Robin. And while being nothing out of this world, It's also better than both of them, at the very least for giving Damian Wayne some very much needed character development so he's not as much of an irritating little brat.

The story is thus: Batman sends Robin to train with the Teen Titans to make him learn to work in a team. Coincidentally, at the same time the extradimensional demon called Trigon, father of empath (and fellow Titan) Raven, is starting to carry out his invasion of our realm, taking control of the Justice League members to do so. It's now up to the Titans to unite and stop the invasion to save the world.

Here are the good things: animation is nice, characterization is pretty good and the story is well told. The structure of the story is far better than in the previous Justice League film, as they don't take as much time to set up things. Raven and Damian are the real stars of the film, so it's good that the latter gets less annoying as the film goes. There are some good moments of levity, as the team is shown socializing out of battle, which goes a long way in humanizing them. The movie does a good job of making all characters feel different, so you never feel like two team members are interchangeable. It's also nice to see another DC movie that doesn't devolve into constant Batman adoration.

As for the negatives, well, the most obvious one is that the title and cover art of this movie are severely misleading. While the Teen Titans do fight the Justice League (or, at the very least, some members of it) a couple of times it's not a constant battle as the title suggests. Even in Batman v Superman, while the heroes only did get one fight, they were strictly antagonists for the majority of the film. Not here, as both teams are only enemies for a short portion and even then members of the League are gradually coming back to be on the Titans side. This is actually a Teen Titans movie where the Justice League are guests. Also, while the cover shows Cyborg fighting alongside the Titans, he only actually ""joins"" the team at the very end. Oh, and they keep insisting on wasting time in the Superman/Wonder Woman romance subplot. Look, it's fine if they want to ship those two even though no one in the fan community wants, but do they have to constantly waste precious running time reminding us of it? I'd very much rather they didn't.

I also find it dissapointing that the teams only fight because the Justice League members are being mind controlled instead of having a difference of opinion. Though I admit that this makes the stakes higher, since the League is willing to kill because of it. As a side mention, ever since the revamp, DC animated films include some sort of post/mid credits stinger. This is no different, but the real problem comes from a previous one. At the end of Throne of Atlantis, the stinger had Lex Luthor seemingly recruiting Black Manta as a member of the Legion of Doom. Rather than use that as a basis for a movie, the Legion is only shown fighting the League as the film's introduction. It's a short, dissapointing fight that reduces the villains to a side note and entirely negates the point of the previous stinger. Hell, Black Manta doesn't even show up (and neither does Aquaman, despite the fact that he joined the League at the end of Throne).

One more thing: my version of the film came with a small plastic figurine of Robin. It's pretty nice, well painted and designed to look just like Damian does in the movie. Obviously, it has no articulation of any kind, but it does a fine ornament on any desk.

So, veredict. It's a nice film. It's fun, it has its ups and downs, but it's better than most (certainly not all) DC DTV films since the revamp. I say go for it. If you can, get the version with the figurine, too.",1514505600,,4067,4.481781376518219

7465112,4,B0169PXGFU,"As this current chapter in the Bruce Timm lore continues, we now add a long awaited group of heroes into the fray.

After Batman: Bad Blood, Batman sends Robin over to the headquarters of The Teen Titans for the sake of learning teamwork and more importantly, surrounding him with heroes that are his age. The question is will this stubborn fighter learn how to work with a team or will he just stick with the status-quo.

I felt it was time to bring The Teen Titans into this film library and the fact that this pivotal film unites the two New 52 story arcs together was pretty well executed. I thought the story wasn't the strongest this library has given us but, the fun factor is there. As a person who loved Young Justice that atmosphere is brought into this film. The chemistry between the characters was well done, the story is great especially, dealing with the origins of Raven and diving into the magical elements of the DCAU which they have not done much of. Stuart Allen and Sean Maher  returning as Robin and Nightwing is such a great touch and Stuart Allen has proven himself to be such a driving force in these films. I my opinion he is the second coming of Kevin Conroy. Every time he voices Robin there is always something new and exciting to see. Even if the film is not the best he always shines.

This film not only creates a brand new story arc in the New 52 timeline but, it keeps the story strong and it shows us that The Teen Titans are relevant. I am hoping with the next story we get more surprises and more action from these young heroes.",1486598400,7,1565,4.367697594501718

Y'all can do so much better than this. The art was actually really good, but everything else was just so thrown together... The title doesn't fit the movie, the movie is boring and I really don't think it deserves as good of reviews as people are giving it.

Personally wish they didn't title the movie as such because without spoiling the plot, the actual titled fight is only about 2 minutes long.  The rest of the movie however is fantastic.  If you loved the 2000s Teen Titans show you will love to see the whole original cast together with the added Blue Beetle and the Damian Wayne Robin.  This movie focuses on my favorite titan Raven and her father Trigon.  While I loved the movie this gets 3 stars because I'm looking for some character development from Damian, who even after the events of Batman: Bad Blood he still treats Nightwing like crap and is a pretentious, overpowered, little brat.

DC just can't seem to find a grip in the regular movie line-up, but the animated movies always hit home. This generation's justice league has been well developed in both Justice League: War and Justice League: Throne of Atlantis. I have been waiting nearly a decade for a good resurgence of the Teen Titans. Cartoon Network butchered the team putting them in a cartoon series that took away all of their personality and image. I especially enjoyed DC taking a fresh approach on Robin from the Son of Batman storyline instead of the previous Teen Titans lineup. This is definitely a 'must see' for DC fans and comic fans alike, but please watch the movies in order so you understand the background of everything!!!",1474243200,2,795,4.605633802816901

7465301,2,B0169PXGFU,"When I watch a movie, I actually want to see a movie. I want to see a well-thought-out, well-written, fleshed out, immersive, gripping story, and developed, fleshed out, realistic characters that I can grow to love. I don't want to watch just ... stuff happening on a screen. This is a major problem with the movie, as I know that there's a really good one somewhere in here. I want to see not just a good story and characters, but I want to see a showcase of (for the most part) decent actors and damn good animation for something direct-to-DVD (though they really need to ease up on the sexualization of Starfire. Seriously, she needs to wear something at least a little more modest). But with the movie having less than eighty minutes to do its thing, there is simply not enough time. The movie should have been at least twenty minutes longer, with an optimum length of maybe two hours.
There's simply too much plot to sift through. First we have the defeat of the Legion of Doom. Then we have Damien being inducted into the Teen Titans. Then we have the introduction of Trigon. The carnival scene. Raven explaining her history, and just what Trigon is and what he wants. BS happens and Raven is taken to free Trigon from his hellish prison. The League and the Titans free her, and the Titans go into Hell and re-imprison Trigon. All is right with the world. That's a lot of plot to get through in less than eighty minutes.
There is so little time that the movie never gives us a scene or two to rest. The movie moves along at such a fast clip that we get little to no time to get to know our characters. Rather, the movie slaps an adjective on each one. Damien is angsty. Raven is tortured...and angsty. Starfire is the needlessly sexualized leader. Beast Boy is hip, cool, slick, etc. Blue Beetle is ... spanish. If i missed any of the Titans, let me know, because this is a pretty easy movie to forget.
Heck, in the case of plenty of devil characters or demon-possessed characters, whenever they speak, I get a vibe of ""Good God, I'm hearing the voice of evil incarnate,"" and I feel a legitimate threat. This was absent in Trigon's case. Remember, in this movie's universe, the Devil's real name is Trigon rather than Satan. But this isn't the Devil that plays on people's vices, manipulating them into doing his dirty work. This is the Devil that just destroys stuff, like the Devil in ""End of Days"".

7465330,4,B0169PXGFU,"Movie Review (8/10) ""Great""
Justice League vs. Teen Titans (2016)
Directed by Sam Liu
There is a dark force that is trying to take over the world by controlling the Justice League through demonic possessions. This dark force from another dimension is trying to come into the dimension of humanity to subjugate the world by using Raven, a member of the Teen Titans, as a conduit to this world. It is up to the Teen Titans to combat not only Trigon, but also the possessed Justice League members to save all of humanity and their team member.

I would say this is more of a Teen Titans movie rather than a Justice League movie, as it focuses more on the Teen Titans and who they are more than who the members of the Justice League are. However, you can tell DC had a bit of a creative conundrum when making this movie. With Cyborg part of the Justice League and no longer a ""teen"" (BTW there is a scene where the Beast Boy invites Cyborg to the Teen Titans and to dump the older heroes for them, but Cyborg responds ""well if you have been part of the big leagues you know..."" It felt like a slap to all of the fans who wanted Cyborg to remain a Teen Titan.), how can you make a Teen Titans movie that will appeal to the current Justice League fans, but at the same time appeal to the fans of the beloved ""Teen Titans"" animated show. Not to mention the fact that this animated DC universe also made Dick Grayson the older Nightwing rather than Robin. The movie also takes hints from the Marv Wolfman/ George Perez Teen Titans run and retells the story of Raven that was told in that particular comic run. They make Starfire a caretaker of the younger Teen Titans and keep Raven and Beast Boy teenagers, and fill the empty spot that was held by Cyborg with a teenager Blue Beetle. For the most part it works, but at the same time I was wondering if Starfire was the real leader of the team, when it seemed like they shoehorning Damian as the Robin to lead the Teen Titans. Also, this is probably a marketing tool for the upcoming Teen Titans Rebirth line as it will consist of Damian Wayne, Wally West II as Kid Flash, Beast Boy, Starfire, and Raven.

Damian Wayne is a badass in this movie. He takes on Blue Beetle by himself and beats him in hand to hand combat, and only when the Beetle takes over completely Robin loses. He also takes on the possessed Superman by himself and manages to exorcise the demon out of Superman while falling thousands of feet from the air. There is a bit of a reunion where Cyborg joins the Teen Titans like the Teen Titans and Teen Titans Go show, although it would also have been cool if Nightwing also joined the team. Beast Boy also has a great action moment where he turns into a demonic wolfman where he just shreds demons into pieces. Probably my favorite scene in the movie was when the Teen Titans go to a carnival and they get to know one another. Robin and Raven might have a romantic thing going on, as they are drawn to each other's loneliness, and Robin and Beast Boy have a ""DDR"" battle to a Korean song. I'm Korean, so I can confirm for you that the lyrics were actually in Korean. :)

I like how DC is continuing the storylines established since ""Justice League: War"" (2014) and ""Son of Batman"" (2014) into this movie, and technically this the sixth movie in this particular universe if you count ""War,"" ""Son of Batman,"" ""Batman Vs. Robin,"" ""Throne of Atlantis,"" and ""Bad Blood."" This movie has some cool action, and explores some of the new characters and I would recommend watching it if you like this new animated universe. There is also a cool hint regarding the upcoming Teen Titans movie towards the end of the movie during the credits so you should stick around and watch for the mid-credit scene. ;)",1472428800,,3752,4.387931034482759

7465357,4,B0169PXGFU,"I guess an actual full-on battle between the JL and TT would not have been fair - adults vs. teenagers - but having Cyborg and Nightwing as go-betweens would have kept the action interesting. I even liked the appearance of Ra's Al-Ghul. While his appearance was explained, I would not have put it past him for this to have really happened. With the level of violence and suggestiveness, this is not necessarily for children viewing.",1471824000,,432,4.773333333333333
7465358,3,B0169PXGFU,"First off - this is NOT a movie for little kids. It is rated PG-13 for a reason. Just because it's animated doesn't mean it's going to be appropriate for your kindergartner.

That said, this wasn't bad. Quite enjoyable in places, actually. The action was good, as was the acting by and large. Not sure I like Christopher Gorem (?) as Batman - he's a little too stoic, believe it or not.  As a very condensed version of the Trigon story, it does its job, and the overlay of Damien becoming a bit more human was a nice contrast.

The designs on the Titans characters are good. I think this is the first time we see Jaime Reyes' Blue Beetle in one of these movies, and they do a really good job with him. Raven and Beast Boy should really be about Starfire's age, but I understand why they made them younger.

However, there were a lot of little things about this movie that bugged me. First off, Nightwing was barely in it. He had no action scenes, and was really reduced to being a sounding board for Damien and Starfire.

Second: what was with the anime-style transformation sequence at the carnival? Talk about padding (and an excuse to linger on Starfire's figure). It really feels out of place.

Thirdly: There is actually a scene where Wonder Woman takes on Starfire - Amazon Smackdown! But...we don't see any of it. Wondy tackles Starfire and they sail into Titans Tower, and then, after a cut, Starfire sails out a window. And that's it.

And lastly: The title is a misnomer. There is one scene where the demonically-processed Justice League fight the Titans, but it's far from the point of the story.

Overall not a bad film, but it could have been much better. Hopefully, if the hint they give during the credits comes to pass, they'll do a much better job with these characters. next time.",1471824000,,1798,4.510769230769231

7465386,3,B0169PXGFU,"JUSTICE LEAGUE VS. TEEN TITANS

Another good showing for the DC animated universe but not exactly what we were expecting. I was excited for this release as the Titans were finally getting a shot at one of these animated films. Like I said in the end it wasn't what I expected but t wasn't bad either, in fact I know some who straight loved it.

The story follows the events of the three previous Batman titles Son of Batman, Batman VS. Robin, and Bad Blood. Basically it was the continuation of Bruces son Damian Waynes story as Robin. This one was about him being forced kinda into the Teen Titans. Once there even while stand offish to the team he becomes interested in Raven. Later it is her father who becomes responsible for the title of this film, the Titans must face the League because one side is under an evil influence.

This was a fun film over all and had a good story but it felt a little underwhelming based on its title. The versus part of the film does not last as long as it should have, kinda like another DC flick, this one being live action. That really is the only thing negative about this flick. The animation looks good and the voice acting is great like all of the other animated flicks. The Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack comes with bonus featurettes, two bonus cartoons from the DCU animated shows and a look at the newly released Batman: The Killing Joke, their first R rated animated film.",1470268800,,1411,4.44015444015444

What has always made good comics great is interpersonal relationships combined with a compelling villain, and a complex plot.  While the Young Justice series was par excellence, this is a worthy effort and well worth the viewers time.  Speaking of Young Justice, could they tie up some of those loose ends with one of these straight to video releases?

I must complain somewhat about the cover art since Cyborg is no longer a member of the Titans.  He should not be the foremost character depicted.  I can only imagine this is PC crap rearing its grotesque head.  If anything, it should be Starfire as she is their mentor or Raven since the story centers on her.",1469404800,,770,4.576642335766423

Some people may like the PG-13 feel complete with adult language such as ""damnnit,"" ""what the hell"" etc. Even the ""doing it with Satan"" part; but I for one have not completely enjoyed the more mature turn that both DC and Marvel have taken with the latest batches of their animated universes.

First I'm No prune and I love me some death and sex scenes in my movies.  Some would say I fall short from being a Christian and they would be right on...But this is right on shameful and disgusting.

7465563,4,B0169PXGFU,"I like all of these DC animated movies. This movie is a great continuation of Damien's story that's been getting played out through the previous DC animated movies. Here we get to meet a different kind of Teen Titans led by an adult Starfire. I really liked this bunch of Teen Titans and even though I usually feel like strangling Damien I was able to get through the movie without hating him too much. Which just goes to show you the character growth that Damien has gone through. So in recap, I like this film.",1467158400,2,512,4.4

Admittedly there are some differences but they make this a good show, especially loved Damian Wayne/Robin and his growing relationship with  Raven while the Starfire Original Robin/Dick Grayson their relationship is well in play.

This movie takes place in the same era as Justice League War and Throne of Atlantis, you can tell by Wonder Woman's crappy new costume.

7465672,5,B0169PXGFU,"Good one to watch for all ages (though dark themes may be a bit intense for the littlest ones) enjoying the comic book reads as well as the animation DC has via Warners, though this is not at all lIke TEEN TITANS GO. There was a scene where the Titans get the call to action by Starfire,where she begins to do a Sailor Moon thing w/the costuming of her at length then the others a bit or not at all, very strange.  Those are pretty much time killing devices for less filling, used a lot in the Asian markets. I gained a little more respect for Robin/Damien, never thinking I would. The story follows a newer group of Teen Titans led and headed by an older Starfire, as tasked by the Justice League. Damien is added to the group last as an attempt to give him team building experience he lacks as Batman's son and sidekick.  Thru a mix of discovery of Raven's past and her providing life saving dark magic the game is on as the intrigue unfolds like a collapsing house of cards. The storyline given this young crew is no less harrowing than any given to adult heroes of other DC animated movies, and as result no punches pulled.  Themes are for older minds but given the access to video games it'd be difficult to gauge exactly. I look forward to more from this group of heroes.

Anyone catch in the end-credit roll, a suprise character as she flies towards the Titan's Tower, w/a seeming sense if urgency?  That begs for the next entry and soon.  Please.",1465689600,3,1454,4.366666666666666

The comedy is a little more kid-oriented compared to the other films, it's clear they wanted to grab a bigger audience here, but it was still pretty good.

Raven's voice was the super generic ""goth kid"" voice, much preferred her ""Teen Titans"" voice. Starfire's voice was way too ""motherly"" - which contrasted with them still trying to give her ditsy lines from time to time.

Blue Beetle & Beast Boy flirting = yas. Beast Boy was cool, more of the Young Justice design.
Why wasn't Blue Beetle on the cover??? Again, trying to grab Teen Titans audiences w/o thinking about the current canon.

Overall was a pretty good animated film for this universe, and made me miss the old school ""Teen Titans"" cartoon.",1465084800,6,781,4.686131386861314

if you enjoy any of the other DC animated movies or just wanted see a good action cartoon i highly recommend it as the plot well done an worth your time. it can be little weird if you only watch the tv version of teen titans  as it follow comics an the titans have different ages then the tv show",1464307200,,534,3.935185185185185

Watching the bonus documentary helps undstand the role the titans have in the DC universe. The Titan lineup lends itself heavily to the upcoming DC Rebirth events where Damien does join the Titans in the upcoming comics. With a tease for Terra at the end, its all a nice setup for more Teen Titan DVDs that will counteract the current Teen Titans Go cartoon. For those complaining about no story, i have to disagree. Very please to get a background story on Raven and her demonic father. Kudos to the writers for respecting Damien's back story in creating a conflict and resolve. This Team of Titans does not fit an older mold. this team rolls within the current ""rebirth"" line of comics and I'm excited to see more.",1463875200,,813,4.575342465753424

7465835,5,B0169PXGFU,"This was a great movie. First DC animated in a while that I really liked. Damian has been a super annoying character since son of batman, but maybe it was all building to his character for this story. This was the first time that I cared about how he was going to mature and what was to come for him. I just kind of tolerated him in the other stories.

Overall, this was like a well animated version of the teen titans cartoon from the early 2000s which I loved. I had just watched an episode prior to watching this movie, and while I missed the original voice actors and disliked Damian, they grew on me by the end of the film. There was definately a lot of fan service for those that were fans of the teen titans cartoon, even managing to get cyborg into the mix, who up to this point was only associated with the justice league. They also made his character seem much older and more mature in the other installments. The scriptwriters kind of bring cyborg back a step in this movie, and reminds you that he is a pretty young guy. Starfire is also obviously older, and kind of the adult of the team and the leader. Raven, beast boy, blue beetle and Damian are the same age as there characters in the old cartoon. It's as if a new generation is moving in to replace the now older Nightwing and Starfire. Speaking of blue beetle, I thought he would be kind of an intrusion, but he grew on me as well.

As for the JL vs TT clash, it wasn't much if any. Don't expect one really. It seems it was more of a way to sell the movie. Which it worked but I would have just as likely bought a ""teen titans"" movie without the justice league star power. But it was a good way to show how certain justice league members got involved with the titans. A ""Justice league and the teen titans"" title would be a little more appropriate in my opinion.

This movie was a great set up for future teen titans movies, even had a little teaser at the end. I'm very excited to see what happens with Damian's character. I also would like to see more of Nightwings and  Starfire's relationship.",1462924800,3,2066,4.2360406091370555
7465836,1,B0169PXGFU,Wow! The character of Damien Wayne (aka the new Robin) is such a jerk - psychotic. It's hard to care whether or not he has any kind of development. Is that what he's like in the comics? Ugh!,1462838400,,190,4.026315789473684
7465837,5,B0169PXGFU,"Excellent, Excellent and did I mention Excellent! Wow welcome back Teen Titans, my goodness what a good story and even a better movie. I really want this to be the beginning of a series of movies based on the Titans and their transition to Adults. The characters were everything they were suppose to be, based on the original series and Batman's Son Damien, What a fantastic addition to the already brilliant cast. Of course in the actual comic book series the Teen Titan's were all the same ages, give or take a year or so, but hey, I fine with this. Raven was outstanding, I want to see a whole lot more of her. Starfire was as sexy and powerful as ever, but of course I expected the result between her and Wonder woman, for obvious reason. The other characters were equally as interesting group of young heroes, all pretty true to their Comic book characters. But if you ask me what was the game changer, I would have to say that Damien (Son of Batman), and Raven (Daughter of Bad, ugly looking Trigon), made this movie great.",1462838400,4,1029,4.4787234042553195
7465838,2,B0169PXGFU,"I saw this movie at a friends house.... Weak story (kinda like being there before feeling).... I am surprised how Lacking my favorite Heros are!

WB is known for their Animated DC Cartoons, I'm not clear what direction they are taking DC Heros.....

I do like the JL and the Titans but there was no fluid chemistry. I am not a fan of Damion Robin...They seem to be rushing the story a lot these days.",1462838400,,567,4.299065420560748

7465846,5,B0169PXGFU,"I am picky about my superhero movies. though the animated ones tend to do alright. I mean yeah I could poke holes into this all day, but anyone could do that with anything really. It has good pacing, good design (the problem I have most often with superhero films is that the characters don't seem to look right), good chemistry and even good humor. Yes you have mainly serious people in this one, but even they can pop a joke now and again. Though there is one point that confuses me, it's not important in the least and does nothing for the story.

My spoiler for you is, There is very little of the justice league fighting the teen titans. Cyborg is apparently a justice leaguer when I have only known him as a titan, and this movie has two leads, both of which don't show up for the first few minutes. They are also the most humorous people in the whole thing, even though one tells a bunch of sarcastic jokes.

Just get it.",1462579200,,928,4.297142857142857
7465847,5,B0169PXGFU,"I really loved this animated movie.  It amazes me how the animated studio at WB hits the nail on the head nearly every time but the live action seems to miss it(by the way i actually like BVS).

I really like that the last few films have followed a story arc between batman and Robin and the other Justice league movies.  Hope they keep this running as the style and drawings look amazing (please don't do another Superman Vs the Elite looking movie). Plus we get to see the characters develop on screen.

Hoping to see a Nightwing animated movie or another Flash movie as we main focus has been on the Bat!(not that that has been a bad thing).",1462492800,2,644,4.341666666666667

7465851,4,B0169PXGFU,"First I need to rant. If you bought this and were disgusted with the ""Satanism"" or the Justice League members being possessed by demons, get over it! It's a bunch of fictional demons being commanded by a fictional demon lord possessing a bunch of fictional characters. I, myself, am a practicing Christian and I have no problem with the subject matter of the film. People just need to get a life! Also, if you bought this and were surprised by the subject matter and were disgusted by it, then that makes you a retard or lazy for not researching info on what you were looking to purchase. Don't complain if you didn't know beforehand that Raven is the daughter of a demon and constantly has to fight her father and his minions. Do your research about the characters if you're that easily offended! Lastly, if you're a disgruntled parent who bought this for your children (below the age of 15) and you are outraged because of how dark it is and the subject matter allow me to give you a little bit of an education: DC IS NOT FOR CHILDREN! If you want to get your child(ren) some superhero animated films that are lighter in tone get them Marvel's crappy animated films seeing as how they appeal to children more. Do your research on what you think you'd like to purchase and stop being so easily offended by everything! You CAN move on with your life!

Now, I thought the movie was great! I kinda wish the Titans and the League would have had a longer fight but it all gave way to an even bigger end that was thoroughly satisfying! I thought the movie had some great character development especially for Damien (who I'm normally not a fan of, but I might be now). I really like the line up here. So glad they had Jamie Reyes as Blue Beetle in it! Loved him from Young Justice. The voice acting is great, and the animation is superb. DC still has animation on lockdown. I think this film is a definite improvement over Throne of Atlantis (which I still enjoyed). I feel as though this movie has broken new ground for DC animation, not just for style, but for what animated projects DC should pursue now; and that post credits scene! OMG! Please DC! Please! If you like Teen Titans and DC's animated films and aren't offended by fictional religious stuff then you'll enjoy this.

Movie keeps it focus on dealing with Raven dad.  the characters designs are first rate and Blue Beetle and Damion  Robin  makes interesting additions to the titan roll call.,1462147200,2,452,4.397590361445783
7465861,5,B0169PXGFU,"Throughly enjoyed this movie. It's a bit different from the Teen Titans we know and love, but it doesn't fall too far. It took a little bit to get used to Raven's new boyish sounding voice, but it's not unpleasant. It was actually kind of nice having a movie centered around her backstory since the tv show only had snippets and really didn't delve into the details. I also enjoyed the titan's interactions and I'd have to say they did a good job with the comedy, Beast boy was silly and funny as always. One thing I don't understand is why Cyborg is on the cover when he isn't a Teen Titan in this movie, Blue Beetle should be there, but I'm guessing it's just to draw in fans of the old cartoon.

7465864,4,B0169PXGFU,"I'm a little let down. I'm not up to date in the comics, but really enjoyed the Son of Batman films and was excited to see more with that Robin. Not knowing the timeline of the stories, I felt like his character took a massive step back only to serve the purpose of having him sent off to the teen titans. The story is okay overall, but the gems are found in Robin interacting with the others and starting to embrace what the rest of us call humanity.

Otherwise, the story and set up is your typical 'bad guy controls good guys so the other more inexperienced good guys have to beat them up.' If this was a series of episodes on TV, i probably wouldn't be as critical, but as a major (albeit direct to DVD/BLU) release it seems like a lesser effort.",1461974400,2,750,4.208333333333333
7465865,1,B0169PXGFU,"I looked forward to this mash-up with great enthusiasm. I expected two great franchises to mesh beautifully and to enjoy a spectacular story with lots of action. I thought making Damian as Robin the pivotal character would be really effective. I was wrong.

This movie is NOT for kids. It is dark, dark and dark. The central story is all about Raven being a daughter of Satan and is full of evil, dark imagery. Raven calls and prays to demons throughout the story. The whole story is about superheroes being possessed by demons to bring about the end of the world.

I am so sick and tired of DC superheroes with a long and positive history being subjected to character rape like this. Character rape is when writers take well-known characters and write them into saying and doing things that are totally inconsistent with their well-known and well-established nature, their values, and their history. After suffering through the miserable  cartoon movie ""Justice League Gods and Monsters"" - in which Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman are presented as monstrosities from hell who act the part - here we are with Raven of the Teen Titans being a daughter os Satan. The whole DC line looks to me to be following a ""how low can you go"" policy with running the respected DC characters into the character rape roles as minions of evil.

I wonder what Bob Kane, Joe Shuster, or Jerry Siegal would think of these travesties of their original characters? I can't imagine them approving of or even respecting these sophisticated trash jobs being done on their original heroes - who used to stand against everything that THESE dark versions of the originals stand FOR. This is truly regretful and embarrassingly bad material. Justice League and Teen Titans meet the Exorcist? WHAAAT?

Justice League: The Throne of Atlantis was right on track. Come on guys. This is really pathetic stuff. Quit trying to become the Anton LeVey of cartoon movie entertainment and get back to what we all used to look forward to: some good quality POSITIVE superhero cartoons.",1461974400,8,2047,4.8538681948424065
7465866,4,B0169PXGFU,"Warner Home Video and DC Comics unleash the fury in their latest direct-to-DVD offering Justice League vs. Teen Titans. The all-new DC Universe Original Movie is brought to us by Director Sam Liu (Batman: Year One, All-Star Superman) from a script by Bryan Q. Miller (The Flash, Arrow) and Alan Burnett (Batman: The Animated Series, Batman Beyond). It is based on an original idea instead of a comic book arc like most of the past animated films.

Frustrated and disillusioned about his work alongside the Justice League, Robin is forced into a new position with a younger super team, the Teen Titans. Readily welcomed aboard, he is immediately intrigued by the mysterious Raven and the unnatural force that looms over them - her father Trigon - a deceptive being powerful enough to destroy Metropolis by pitting the mighty Justice League against the Teen Titans. Loyalties are on the line and lives hang in the balance in Justice League vs. Teen Titans.

Justice League vs. Teen Titans reminded me of what would happen if an old Satanic Panic flick like Rosemarys Baby, The Exorcist, or The Masque of the Red Death was blended together with a super hero movie. You have the mother who is deceived into giving herself over to a cult and spawning the daughter of Satan (or Trigon as they call him in the DC Universe). The offspring of the Unholy One fights her destiny and chooses to use her powers for good. The only difference between this and a classic horror film starring Vincent Price or Linda Blair is the inclusion of Robin the Boy Wonder, Starfire, Cyborg, Beast Boy, Blue Beetle, Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman.

Writers Bryan Q. Miller and Alan Burnett are no strangers to the DC world of super heroes. Burnett has helped create some of the most adored animated television shows and movies from the past three decades, while Miller has brought to life several different comic book characters through live-action series starting with Smallville. Director Sam Liu knows how to pull it all together and give it a breakneck speed while not skimping on the story.

I applaud the filmmakers for trying to reach out to a teen crowd with their use of rock and dance pop numbers as the Titans try to blow off some adolescent steam at a carnival. They also do a decent job of creating some convincing chemistry between Robin and Raven, who feel like they're the outcasts of the supergroup. At the same time, older comic fans might feel as if they're watching an episode of DeGrassi: The Next Generation or The O.C.

Justice League vs. Teen Titans is rated PG-13 for fantasy action violence and some suggestive images. Several demons get their heads chopped off and regrow them. Our heroes also go to Hell and battle some very disturbing creatures that get hacked up. Its definitely not for younger audiences.

Just be warned, parents. These are not the happy-go-lucky super heroes you know from Teen Titans GO! The group of youthful crimefighters we see here tend to use some profanity and are dark, angry, and grim. Their leader, Starfire, enjoys wearing extremely short skirts and shirts fashioned with what I call a boob window. I think she might use it as a distraction for her enemies while she battles with them. Theres plenty of fun for older teens and adults to be had, but intense and disturbing scenes and other adult content keep this from being something the whole family can watch.

The bonus material for the Blu-ray of Justice League vs. Teen Titans includes everything weve come to expect from these releases. Three featurettes entitled Growing Up Titan, Heroes and Villains: Raven, and Heroes and Villains: Trigon are included. Two bonus cartoons from the DC Comics Vault give us more Teen Titans action. We also get a sneak peek at DC Universes next animated movie, Batman: The Killing Joke.

With a great voice cast including Rosario Dawson as Wonder Woman, Jerry OConnell as Superman, Jason OMara as Batman, and Jon Bernthal as Trigon, Justice League vs. Teen Titans is another action-packed thrill ride from DC Comics and Warner Home Video. Although the frantic pacing and short run-times of these animated movies sometimes feel a bit light on story buildup, they accomplish what they set out to. Theyre a comic book put in motion before our very eyes.",1461888000,,4277,4.82537517053206

7465871,2,B0169PXGFU,"This was an incredible disappointment. I don't honestly recommend it if you were a fan of the original series. While I understand the universe is different the final fight is just Let Superman do everything. Batman and Nightwing do nothing the whole movie, and there's hardly enough charcter relationship building do actually end the movie with everyone as friends. I really did not like this movie,",1461628800,,399,5.0606060606060606
7465872,4,B0169PXGFU,"If there's one thing I can say about this movie, it's that it's a lot better than the cartoon that's on right now on Cartoon Network.  I got to say, though, that it seems like it's unnecessary to call this movie ""Justice League vs Teen Titans.""  Yeah, the Justice League is in it, but this movie is mostly about the Teen Titans and Robin learning to be part of the team, despite his ""lone wolf"" mentality.  Plus, the Justice League are possessed throughout most of the movie, so it's not like the two are actually fighting each other.  It just seems unneeded for the most part.

With that nitpick out of the way, if you liked the original Teen Titans cartoons from the early to mid 2000s, you'll find some enjoyment from this.  Unlike the current Teen Titans Go that's all in your face with it's ""random"" humor, this movie keeps the humor and action in balance, and it's a more mature take on the superhero group, which I question why it, along with a few other DC animated movies, are in the Kids and Family section, with the small amount of language, blood and all, but that's a whole other can of worms.  Even though Cyborg doesn't get that much screen time, I'm glad that they kept Beast Boy as the comic relief of the group, and the action can be pretty fun to watch, especially at the beginning of the movie.  I also feel that the animation is good, but out of the DC animations I've seen, it's not that much of a shock.  Really, I think this is the best we can get for a current day Teen Titans, maybe until the sequal that the movie is hinting at.  I don't want to spoil the whole story, but I recommend checking it out.  Unlike Amazon's category system, though, I don't recommend it for kids unless if they are in the teen range (which doesn't affect my score in anyway.  I just found it weird how it's in that category.)",1461628800,,1830,4.318713450292398

7465878,3,B0169PXGFU,"Being a Fan of both Justice League and Teen Titans, I was really looking forward to this release, but was let down. This is not true comic cannon as Starfire and Nightwing are adults, but Beast Boy is just a young teen. The story can't decide if it is going to about Robin or Raven, and sadly it suffers really bad because of this. Maybe someone at DC didn't think a story focused on Raven could sell the title, but they are very wrong. The animation is really just ok, and poor in other areas. Also if you expecting to see a strong enemy in Trigon, you will sorely be disappointed. When Trigon does start his rampage, it is over before it begins. I want to see a Teen Titans movie, but it will never get made with such poor writing as this story suffered from.

7465880,5,B0169PXGFU,"Once again, DC really does well with animated features.  It is amazing that they struggle so much with their movies, but excel with these animated features. Marvel does the opposite...putting out average animated features, but much more well received films.

JLA vs Teen Titans is no exception.  The characters that DC has been re-developing in the last few years are really good together.

7465884,3,B0169PXGFU,"As a DC animated title, it ranks up there in entertainment value, and though I've never been big on the ""Teen Titans"" in any of their first-boot, re-boot & re-re-boot incarnations, I found this to be an enjoyable story nonetheless. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite live up to the expectations I'd had for it, and not just due to the fact that this entry was even more poorly and misleadingly titled than ""BATMAN V SUPERMAN"" (judging from the many uncomplimentary remarks about the ""World's Finest"" in their first major motion picture outing), but also because it seemed to lack the care-&-concern inducement of a perceived ""real threat"" that they had to face down -- yes, I know ""Trigon"" is supposed to be a baddazzz and all, but I'm unconvinced he's such a major threat to the world when all he seems capable of is walking around a small Middle Eastern city like a Godzilla wannabe whose only minions are in the form of a half-dozen hellspawn (please don't sue me, Todd) and by mind-controlling a select handful of Justice Leaguers to do... ""what,"" exactly?

Right around the same time as I was awaiting the arrival of my ""JLvTT"" DVD, I'd gotten introduced to, and immersed in, the ""YOUNG JUSTICE"" animated television series, and even though I've never liked any of the DC ""kid sidekick"" characters, I found the stories & plotlines of ""YJ"" to be very intelligently written and produced (marvellously, despite the fact they were basically created for the purpose of promoting a toy line), and it is quite obvious that a lot of thought, planning, and care was put into making it something that would grab you and hold onto you and leave you drooling from the lip for more, more, more! In contrast, it seems as though the writers/producers of ""JLvTT"" were sort of riding down the straight & level stretch of highway on cruise control, and only tried to ""force"" an interest into what might later be in store for us in a possible future ""Titan"" project by presenting us with an end credit sequence announcing the advent of ""[NAME WITHHELD TO PREVENT SPOILER]"" (whose brief fleeting appearance will mean absolutely nothing to anyone not already familiar with the character and her story arc, and whom even for those of us in the know will likely be greeted with a confused facial expression while blurting out under our breath, ""HUH?... REALLY? Umm... WHY?"").

Again, it's not bad, by any means... it's just one of those rare instances where the DC direct to digital media animated features are really not playing their ""A-game."" If they were to bring more of the same sort of spirit of the ""Young Justice"" series over to the next ""Teen Titans"" direct home release project that they should ever decide to plan, then it would almost certainly be another in a long string of DC animated ""Home Runs"" (unintended accidental pun, but I'll take it all the same).",1461456000,7,2850,4.7555555555555555
7465885,5,B0169PXGFU,"Just finished watching, along with Jeff H., ""Justice League vs Teen Titans"" released by Warner Brothers.
Jeff H. keeps wondering why Warner Brothers doesn't try to released these animated movies based on DC comics and graphic novels on the Silver Screen in a national/international released.  It all depends on the economics, I do keep reminding him.  A Big Screen release would, in all likelihood, drastically cut into the profit margin.  A straight to DVD release guarantees a bigger profit margin for Warner Brothers and keeps future productions in the pipeline.
What to do with an out-of-control Robin who frequently ignores Batman's - his father's - commands and takes action on his own to resolve a situation - in this case a villain who suddenly gets a boost of supernatural power?
Hey so Robin ignores Batman's orders to lead civilians to safety by going off to confront the newly powerful villain and in the process not only takes him down, but manages to destroy the multi-million dollar Batplane in the process.  It's amusing to see how impressed everyone else in the Justice League is impressed by Damien's actions; but are rendered silent by a smoldering glance from Batman.
Batman decides Robin - Damien - needs to learn the importance of teamwork and relationship building.  So he delegates Nightwing - Dick Grayson - to drive him out to the Titan Tower where he will become a member of the Teen Titans who are under the guidance of Starfire.
Once there, Damien promptly goes into battle with every Teen Titan in an effort to show that he's Number One and is promptly almost killed; but healed by Teen Titan member Raven.
Raven is hiding from her father - the uber-demon of Hell - Trigon.  Having once trapped him in a dimension that he destroyed, Raven is seeking her own place.  Trigon has other plans.  He wants Raven to free him so that he can destroy the Earth and other dimensions.  His demons take over all of the Justice League - except the ever paranoid Batman who injects himself with nerve toxin to force the demon out of his body - and coerce Raven to start the process to released him into the world.
""Justice League vs Teen Titans"" explores how a person gains their sense of identity and self worth - while of course in a life-and-death struggle with a multi-dimensional villain.

 The film is visually appealing like most DC animated films.

The story had a lot of plot holes and even more unexplained concepts (why does beast boy tranform? Why does the conquerer of worlds casually stroll through Earth? Where is his army? Etc).

I enjoyed seeing the characters interact and as much as I like Damien I feel like he's being shoved into too many stories where he doesn't really belong. I find myself thinking ""didn't Damien learn a life lesson like this in the last 3 movies?""

As the latest offering from the DC Universe Animated Original movie lineup, this film offers little to entice DC fans.  Ever since James Tucker has stepped in as head producer for these films, the overall quality has severely dropped.  The Batman trilogy (Son, vs. Robin, Bad Blood) and the current Justice League trilogy (War, Throne of Atlantis, vs. Teen Titans) just doesn't quite measure up to some of the better offerings such as Wonder Woman, Green Lantern: First Flight, The Dark Knight Returns, and Batman: Under the Red Hood.  Animation is overall pretty average.  Voice cast is ok, the Titans mainly do their job and that is it.  Damian is still maddening as a character and I really wish he is either killed or replaced.  Jon Bernthal is wasted as Trigon, and is barely in the film to count as the main villain.  The Justice League play minor roles and the so called battle between the JL and TT occurs once and it sucks.

7465954,4,B0169PXGFU,"As the third of the Justice League animated movies post-Flashpoint, they decided to mix it up by introducing the Teen Titans of this New 52 DC Animated Universe. While picking up on the hot trend of ""heroes vs. heroes"", this movie did the other clich of having one of the sides being possessed/mind controlled.

The League is battling the Legion of Doom made up of supervillains attacking their new Hall of Justice HQ. This takes the post-credits scene from the end of Throne Of Atlantis with Lex Luthor and Ocean Master, and quickly sweeps it under the rug making Luthor out to be just a stereotypical criminal genius with a team of superthugs, and Ocean Master is even on their roster. During the attack, Weather Wizard gets all powered up and starts flooring the League(who here are minus Shazam, Aquaman, and Green Lantern for no explained reason), but Robin nukes Wizard with the Batplane, and despite the positive results he gets once again lectured by Batman. As punishment, Robin is taken by Nightwing to join the Teen Titans, which here its not totally explained if Nightwing was ever a part of, but is lead by Starfire, along with Raven, Beast Boy, and Blue Beetle III. Robin doesn't get along with his new teammates, and nearly gets killed by Beetle's armor. Raven uses her power to heal him, but looks inside his mind to see his past, including showing a scene from Batman Vs. Robin where Bruce Wayne dreamed of a future Damian destroying Gotham after taking up his mantle, which is weird because Raven shouldn't be able to see Batman's dreams from inside Damian's head. Starfire decides to take the kids to an amusement park for some fun, and we're suddenly involved in a prolonged DDR commercial between Damian and Beast Boy. Superman is meanwhile possessed by a demon, and the League tries to find ties to this supernatural force. It turns out to be Raven's father, the demon lord Trigon, and he sends some of his minions to capture her, but the Titans do their ""magical girl"" henshin to change and fight off Raven's stepbrothers. Raven then teleports the Titans to the mystical realm of Azarath(which is a dead ringer for Paradise Island from previous DC animated movies!)that now lays in waste after Raven reveals her past of Trigon torching the place when she was a child. The team returns to Titans Tower, where the League confronts them to take Raven into custody recognizing her as the source of Superman's possession, only for the remaining Leaguers to get possessed too. Batman manages to paralyze himself before being consumed, and Beetle frees Cyborg when Raven agrees to go with the now enthralled Wonder Woman and Flash. The Titans along with Cyborg head to the Middle East where Superman has unearthed a giant portal to bring Trigon to Earth. Robin uses Kryptonite to free Superman, who in turn frees Flash and Wonder Woman. The Titans then go to Trigon's realm to reseal him inside a magic crystal that Raven originally contained him in, but the ""ghost"" of Ra's al Ghul shows up out of nowhere to destroy it. Ra's explains to his grandson Damian that Trigon was his benefactor in creating the Lazarus Pits which kept him alive for centuries, although its more than likely to be just one of Trigon's little helpers possessing the undead body of Ra's to mess with Robin. Raven does muster enough strength to pull Trigon back into a shard of the original crystal which she now adorns on her forehead, and the Titans go back home with Robin a part of the team, and the possibility of Cyborg joining them part time.

JL VS. TT manages to be the first credible movie in the New 52 continuity as its a mostly original story which retells the original Trigon saga from the 80s in a modern setting, although its not much of a ""vs."" story. Then again, most superhero ""vs."" stories don't involve much of the two heroes or teams actually fighting each other. There should have been a separate film with the JLA battling the Legion of Doom in this post-Flashpoint timeline, so its hard to say where they'll take this version of the League after this, aside from possibly one of the Darkseid War. This movie had a post-credits scene too of Terra heading for Titans Tower hinting at The Judas Project, although that would depend on if Deathstroke survived at the end of Son Of Batman. It would have been nice to have somekind of prologue showing how this version of the Teen Titans originally got together, especially since this is only time that Damian Wayne has actually been in the Titans, plus if there were other members prior to the ones we were introduced to like Kid Flash or Tim Drake. Worth getting if you're a fan of the original Teen Titans TV series, or just caught up in the whole ""heroes vs. heroes"" sub-genre.",1460764800,,4739,4.687875150060024
7465955,3,B0169PXGFU,"C- Movie Rating

You start with tons of action and amazing visuals that draw you in; then throughout the story you find that raven is the daughter of the devil; at this point there are satanic stars popping up all over your screen. I quickly felt like I was watching the wrong movie..there was very little about the justice league fighting the teen titans, and more them being possessed by demons to help resurrect the devil. The title is extremely misleading, this movie should be called the rise of trigon(the devil). The actual fight between the justice league and titans never really happens; as mentioned above, they were possessed by demons. Not exactly what I thought I was buying. There is a very real attempt to humanize the demon witch raven, she is the main character. Also, The music in some parts is trendy emo punk band music that really doesn't fit, Instead of the epic string scores you'd come to expect from a title with this name. Overall it was ok. Not a rating above ok. And I can honestly say I wouldn't buy it again if it broke. Not the best. But then again I actually believe in God..so anything humanizing a demon witch and building hype by giving a false title, is going to strike a bad mood...especially when I expected ""the justice league vs teen titans""..instead I got Raven vs Trigon.",1460764800,,1313,4.587234042553192
7465956,4,B0169PXGFU,"*SPOILERS ***

While I found the movie enjoyable I did have a few beefs with the film, One...Where was Nightwing??? I mean wouldn't it make sense he'd help out or something?? I kind of feel that was a plot hole in some ways. Two, What's with Beast Boy turning into like Demon/interdimensional creatures?? I can't help but feel that was just a case of ""Surprise! Plot convenience!!"", I mean I didn't hate that or anything I just wish it had been explained. I also can't help but think the Justice League kind of held the ""Idiot ball"" when Raven told them they were more or less in position for a trap, but I suppose this was necessary to the story. Finally, Trigon....Y U Take so much time to wreck Earth??? I mean this dude basically wrecks Azareth with like ONE single attack and then he just...decides to stroll through Earth?? I also was kind of disappointed he just came through by himself I mean you'd think a demonic force hell bent on conquering would bring along...I don't know, HIS ARMY!! Beefs aside, I liked the characters I enjoyed there interactions. I really like how Damian gets blasted in the face by Blue Beetle I thought that was a great way for him to be humbled and begin interacting with the characters (From the trailer I thought the Justice League was just going to be possessed and they'd all be like ""Well, guess we gotta be friends""). Overall the movie was interesting, the action is decent, and the characters are developed enough to be enjoyable.

It had some good action in it, and I always love to see when superhero, sci-fi, and magic themes are present in a DC story. It definitely had some awkward bits, but overall I enjoyed it and would recommend it. In my opinion, even with the Justice League and Teen Titans fighting demons from hell, it was still far more upbeat and enjoyable then the depressing and dark live action Batman vs Superman movie.

These new movies are still worth the purchase from me because I like to see these guys on screen, being so intrigued with the books.  So many hands and ideas take place now, that it feels VERY corporate and heartless.  Again, I still bought it, but I was so excited for this, especially hearing seeing Sam Lui directed.

7465984,3,B0169PXGFU,"Meh. Disappointed in the story but on the other hand you got cool characters and design.
My problem was not a whole lot got explained and poor Nightwing gets cut again! Don't put the poor guy in concept art and tease us with the Starfire/Nightwing romance if you'll do nothing with it! Poor guy needs his own movie!
Anyway that and suddenly Beast Boy can morph into demons? (Can he do that in comics? idk, seemed weird they threw it in for no reason) Also would love to hear more about each of the Titans. We got Raven's story, hints at Starfire's, but Beast Boy? Blue Beetle? I already knew cause Teen Titans and Young Justice, but I wanted more! Plus not to mention all the other people who aren't hardcore fans. Also Ras Al Guhl? Kinda murky was he a demon that could shapeshift or was it actually Ras? guess we'll never know
Points however for Batman taking himself out of the picture, nice to see Wonder Woman's combat moves and yborg fight with the Titans Daien as usual is sucking someone's dick at WB cause he took down Superman in seconds! C'mon guys he's not Superman he's Robin! One that actually gets more annoying the more you see! Has he learned anything? He decapitated Ras as if he hasn't been taught by Batman not to kill! He's way OP and way to self absorbed.
Anyway rant over, here's hope that Killing Joke gets it right!",1460505600,,1340,4.42914979757085

When it came to War, it felt like the entire movie was just one big action scene with very little in terms of story and Throne of Atlantis felt like it was lacking in action until the end. With Justice League vs. Teen Titans, you'll see action spread throughout the film as they develop the Trigon storyline and build the characters of Raven, Damian, and (though, not as much as the previous two) Starfire. Overall, I'd say this sets the tone for future Teen Titans films and even sets up the next one in the mid-credits scene. Hope this was helpful.",1460419200,,684,4.436507936507937

But this one was really wonderful. And the title itself and description are actually fairly misleading as to what the actual plot is. Anyway if you enjoyed Justice League War or Throne of Atlantis, you will enjoy this movie. That's basically all you need to know :) Just it's more in step with the tone of the Justice League animated movies rather than Batman Son of Robin and broad in scope.

7465988,4,B0169PXGFU,"*No spoiler*

The last few DC animated films have been kind of a hit or miss (i.e. Throne of Atlantis and JL War). Thankfully, this film sorta redeems those disappointments and keeps the momentum going with the recently released Batman V Superman film (which is a masterpiece by the way). I wouldn't say this movie is amazing or spectacular, but it is entertaining and it's a must have for any fan of JL and Teen Titans. The film is actually quite enjoyable and has a nice balance of action and comedy - courtesy of TT. Knowing they're young teens, silly immature humor and comments are expected and I feel it works well here to balance the ultra serious JL. They injected just enough humor to keep things flowing properly.

The film starts off action oriented with JL in a fight scene with famous DC villians as the eventual plot slowly unfolds. We even get to see the JL heroes do simple ordinary human things such as laundry (Clark Kent). I actually enjoyed these subtle moments were they were just being normal. The film's premise and plot surrounds Raven and a lot of it addresses her origins which I was unfamiliar with. I found her character and origins to be insightful. Be warned, the majority of the film centers around TT more so than JL and I'm glad because TT never really had their own official animated film, so I'm glad to see them get the spotlight for a change. In my opinion, this TT film is much needed since the Young Justice show never got a much deserved 3rd season.

Overall, the film has a nice flow of action, drama and comedy, and I didn't find it boring since the interactions between the TTs keep things interesting. There's even punk rock and pop music in one of the scenes in the film where the TTs are doing a group activity. There's even Sailor Moon-esque TT transformations. What else could a fan ask for? This is what i mean by an even balance and it really gives this film some character. My only complaint is some of the voice actors. I personally love hearing Kevin Conroy as Batman and the actor who voices him here sorta resembles Kevin, but nothing compares to the original. Rosario Dawson as Wonder Woman is ok, but gawd do I hate the new WW costume which was also in the JL War film. If anything, give her the outfit from the BvS movie. I definitely recommend fans pick this up as it is executed in a way where it's down right entertaining and it's just an explosion of everyone's favorite teen heroes.

Also, there's a teaser or Easter egg during the credits so don't miss that. I have no idea who that is, so if someone can let me know, it would be greatly appreciated.",1460419200,17,2614,4.450939457202505
7465989,4,B0169PXGFU,"Justice League vs. Teen Titans is an animated feature in which two teams go head-to-head against each other in an elaborate battle. Frustrated and disillusioned about his work alongside the Justice League, Batmans son Damian Wayne, aka Robin, is forced into a new position with a younger super team, the Teen Titans. Welcomed aboard, he is immediately fascinated by the mysterious Raven and the unnatural force that looms over them  her satanic, world-conquering father Trigon, a deceptive, imposing being powerful enough to destroy Metropolis. Trigon escapes from his inter-dimensional prison and infiltrates the minds and bodies of the Justice League to do his bidding, precipitating a massive battle with the Teen Titans. The super hero showdown finds Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Cyborg battling Beast Boy, Starfire, Blue Beetle and Nightwing.

 The Teen Titans adventure dominates, even though the Justice League appears in the films title. Primarily, the story introduces Robin to the team and concentrates on the dynamic between Robin and the other Teen Titans. Unfortunately, the cool characters of Starfire and Nightwing don't get a lot of screen time, even though there are hints of their history together. This movie continues the filmmakers efforts in introduce characters and their history into DC Universes current continuity.

The deluxe 2-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack contains 3 behind-the-scenes featurettes, 2 bonus cartoons, a sneak peak at DCs next animated movie, Batman: The Killing Joke, and a Robin figurine. There is also a 2-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack edition that comes without the Robin figurine. Both editions contain a digital HD copy.",1460419200,13,1671,5.465116279069767

The plot is stuffed with unnecessary details leaving little room for the final act. Here's a tip, when making a movie with a limited run time, it may not be a good idea to spend ~10min on a dance battle or magical-girl style transformations that have nothing to do with the plot! The voice acting is also widely inconsistent with the major flaw being Raven's voice which sounds flat and monotone in all the scenes. Overall this movie has some major cringe moments and I feel bad for anyone that actually paid to see this poorly pieced excuse of a film.
I honestly cannot believe that the DC animation studios have sunk so far as to release this! Just a few years ago gems like Batman: Year One were being produced! What happened DC? GET IT TOGETHER!",1459814400,7,878,4.392638036809816

There is no introduction of characters. It assumes you have been following the Batman vs Robin series. The current Robin is named Damian and is the illegitimate son of Batman. The original Robin had moved on to be known as Nightwing for some reason I confuse with a duck. Wonder Woman dates Superman and not Batman and to be honest, I must have missed the episode which bumped Lois out of the picture, or else they never bothered.

7466007,2,B0169PXGFU,"Yes, this movie has nice character design's Yes, the movie has pretty good animation, and Yes it has a good plot but, it really suffers from poor direction and character focus. I'll be honest, I was pretty bored while watching this movie and I couldn't help but, feel that this was two separate movies jumbled together. DC's animated movies seem to be going slowly downhill since Justice League war and I can't help but feel as if they're relying a bit to HEAVILY on batman to bring in money. I agree that this is something a 13-15 year old would enjoy but, that's a pretty small age gap.
It's okay for a time waster or something to have on it the background but that's about it.

Once again Damien is thrust into the spotlight and once again he is learning the exact same lesson for the third time in a row. I'm not a Raven fan but even I can see that this movie would have been a lot better if Raven and Damien's positions were reversed with Raven as the Focus and the events from her point of view with Damien taking a backseat and being the mysterious and mostly silent character. Sure Damien still could have had the same character arch, it just should have been more subtle and not at the forefront of the story. They also should have given some of his screen time to the other 3 characters and actually develop them better. Y'know give everyone some type of problem or hang up that they have to either work through or acknowledge in order to function as a team?

Yes DC we know you really like Damien but all of his so called ""LESSONS"" and ""GROWTH"" seem to ring hollow when he has no behavioral changes and especially when his actions have no real believable consequences.

I hate to sound like a broken record but, The Young Justice Pilot/Movie did this setup better, in a shorter amount of time(JL vs TT did have some pretty good idea's though).",1459641600,31,1854,4.399416909620991

7466020,5,B0169PXGFU,"Honestly, I loved this movie. I grew up watching the original animated Teen Titans and Justice League and have always fantasized about those characters coming together.

Overall, the movie is good, though the pacing is a little off if you consider that the Justice League takes up half the title, but barely any of the movie.

SPOILER ALERT:
So I know a lot of fans of the original animated Teen Titans series were Robin/Starfire fans, and they get some love in this movie (Robin being Richard Grayson as Nightwing in this continuity). You'll also see hints of this relationship in the previous animated films with Damian Wayne, such as Batman vs. Robin and Batman: Bad Blood.

Anyway, while DC pleases some of its Star/Robin fans, it also slightly appeases the Robin/Raven fans that emerged during season 4 of the animated series (albeit with a different Robin -Damian). If you're a Robin/Raven fan, you'll definitely enjoy this movie.

Beast Boy is the comic relief in this movie and there's really only one good moment between him and Raven. To those BB/Rae fans, a moment is better than nothing.

Also, if you're fans of Superman/WW, you'll probably enjoy this movie.

What's nice about the DC universe is the concept of the multiverse. The ""imaginary"" stories and Elseworlds have the possibility of coming together, as seen with the Arrowverse, and the recent Supergirl/Flash crossover. If you watch the special features in Justice League: Gods and Monsters, you'll definitely see that the multiverse is expanding and it's not just limited to the live action or comics or animated features exclusively. It's not so much that they keep rebooting franchises, they're including more and more material to satisfy the needs of all kinds of different fans. In Justice League vs. Teen Titans, Ra's al Ghul gets tied into the Trigon storyline... Which gives me hope that since Ra's was in Arrow, maybe TNT will finally take the leap with the Teen Titans show.

While one may argue this has nothing to do with the 2003-06 cartoon based on Teen Titans so old fans should keep quiet, the fact that DC is copying several elements from that specific incarnation including Raven, Starfire and Trigon's character designs, proves this movie is nothing but a quick cash grab which plays on your nostalgia. Another clear evidence of a cash grab is how they have brought in famous small-screen actors instead of using actual people with voice acting professions. This fools a lot of dumb viewers, the types that go:

Bringing in small-screen actors for voice acting in no way determines the potential of a story. But lets come to the real deal, if you want to attract Titan fans, what do you have to offer? More than being about the Titans, this movie is going to be the 4th in a row of movies based on Damian Wayne, son of Batman. What baffles me is that after producing 3 movies based on this rather arrogant, self-centered and spoiled kid only a 12 year old brat can relate to, DC has yet to understand why people hate Damian Wayne so much and why the movies didn't do as good as others they made.

Fact is: this movie timeline loves to give Damian random feats which is a straight up slap in the face of those who respect the heroes and villains Damian's unrealistically defeated or surpassed in these movies. This includes Deathstroke AKA the strongest mercenary in DC Universe who even Batman has had trouble defeating. Nightwing AKA the best Robin according to Batman himself, is also taken out like a weakling by this new kid and even Batman himself shows clear trouble in confronting him. For the record, these are made up feats for the movies exclusively as Damian is not capable of doing any of this. If you're having a hard time understanding why this is a problem, then imagine this scenario:

'A new hotheaded superhero suddenly shows up in DC and beats a couple of your favorite superheroes to a pulp like it was nothing. The more this new superhero will stick around, the more horrified you'll become realizing he isn't going anywhere and his arrogant attitude will never change. Soon, DC starts producing movies on this new guy, where he badmouths and bests any superhero you know and love. Now you understand where I'm coming from.'

Which leads me to say, DC is forcing a character onto fans. A character who isn't even supposed to be OP. And all fans do is take it without daring to criticize the company. As a mature reader and follower of DC comics and animated movies, I have yet to find a reason on why I should like Damian Wayne. He has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and I am not like those simpletons who believe being Batman's son automatically makes you a great character. To be honest, Batman himself is a hypocrite for going easy on Damian for murdering people while lashing out on Jason for breaking less serious rules in the past.

The sneak peak previews tells us how this is the first incarnation of the Teen Titans and the line up includes Raven who is a child for some reason which doesn't make any sense because she was the one who predicted the second incarnation of the Titans and told the first Robin that he will have to lead them. Starfire is made the oldest and acts as the mother figure. I don't mind this change but if Dick Grayson was never a Titan then how did Starfire become an accepted member of society? He had a very heavy hand in guiding her in the right direction. Beast Boy is a kid as well. Blue Beetle is older than Beast Boy for some reason despite everyone knowing he became a superhero long after the Titans being established for years and finally Damien himself... this is the worst offend because [A] they said in the interviews that Damian has never been a Titan in his entire life when he actually HAS been a member in the comic. So basically the official writers are not researching from their own source material and [B] if this is the first Robin to lead the Teen Titans then how was this group established in the first place? Who has been leading the Titans all this time? Starfire? The girl who can barely understand this new planet she is a part of?

So why this uninspired new line-up you ask? Just another element in this huge cash grab as all stated characters are fan-favorites but when has adding fan-favorites without giving proper reason for them to be there has ever worked out before? Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3 and Marc Webb's Amazing Spider-Man 2 tried that and we all know how they went. From what I've read, there is also a slight hint of Raven and Damien shipping, which is ridiculous because [1] there would be no contrast, all they can do is brood together and [2] least of all, Damien shouldn't be following into his father's footsteps of dating and bedding girls. This will truly destroy any potential he has, along with both his and Raven's characters. They've been doing this with other characters in New 52 and all it has received is hate and disrespect for the very characters people once loved.

""Why not watch the movie when it comes out?""

Sure, I'll do that and if it's good I'll come back and change my review. However, I wouldn't expect much if I were you. Based on DC's past record, sneak peek and interview, I can say this movie won't be half as good as you are expecting it to be. I only hope it doesn't kill the Teen Titans popularity. Many old TT fans hoped to see more of their favorite characters but this is far from what they have in mind.",1453680000,42,5728,4.514946962391514

As a believer in Jesus Christ I'm appalled by this movie. Parents be careful what you allow your kids to watch. Especially parents that are Christian's. The black arts are very real and nothing to engage in or take lightly.  This just shows me where our society is. I will pray for the writers and producers of D.C. comics.",1532390400,,496,4.7011494252873565

Just a heads-up, you'd be best served to watch this *BEFORE* ""Teen Titans: The Judas Contract"" as this movie's ending leads into key characters from ""Judas Contract.""",1528761600,,406,4.898550724637682
