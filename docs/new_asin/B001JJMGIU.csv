3658078,1,B001JJMGIU,"As stated in the othe review, this movie is really awful! I was excited about the movie due to the wonderful actors playing in it, but I was EXTREMELY dissapointed in their performances and the TERRIBLE storyline! If you really want to see this movie rent it, please DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. You'll regret spending the money(like me) if you do! On another note, the title is very misleading, this has NOTHING to do with a school of spys! Sorry if your dissapointed, but I wished someone had written this review before I purchased Spy School!!!!!!!",1232928000,4,545,4.628865979381444

3658080,1,B001JJMGIU,Wow. Plot was thinner than a politicians promise. Some of the lines appear to have been written at the last minute and possibly by an intern. Not exactly Emmy material but it was modestly entertaining for small kids. Parents may want to bring a book. Or headphones....,1484438400,4,268,4.723404255319149
3658081,5,B001JJMGIU,"My son and his friends watched this in my classroom after school. Both the boys and girls thought this was a good movie. They put it on their list of 'all time great movies.'

3658098,1,B001JJMGIU,When I first saw this movie I thought this film was going to be a good action packed movie and fun. Well I was wrong. I even thought it was soon going to be the movie version of the book by the same name by Stuart Gibbs which is way better. Then again I was wrong. There is no relation between the book and this film. It's just awful because of the unbelievable plot.,1479513600,,367,3.972972972972973

The story of a brilliant boy who doesn't fit in at school, his relationship with his mother, his missing father and the stories that he tells everyone about why the father isn't part of the family, a misfit girl who is his friend and various characters that he encounters at school regarding a secret visit to a school dance of the daughter of the President of the United States.  Movie has some very funny parts, funny lines, but is often rather clichd regarding those students  that are not part of the ""popular crowd"" and the school teachers and administrators.",1431388800,,621,4.6880733944954125

PLOT
*Thomas walks into the library with Jackie and they talk
*Then he goes into the science room and makes purple paint, which he then vandalizes the room with
*He goes home and talks with Jackie again*
*He goes to school
*He talks to a teacher....and so on, the movie goes on quite like this.
Turn away from entertaining yourself or children with this movie.
Sounds like a regular day of a kid: go to the library (paint making isn't that normal, okay), goes home, talks to friend, goes to school, blah-blah.
The movie should be called 'school'. It depicts nothing but a twelve year old boy's school life with Jackie, his friend. Not even very great acting. Don't watch it, OK. I will not be watching any more movies that say "" A Mark Blutman Film"" on the cover.

About 3 quarters of the way through the movie Thomas put a stupid phone in the weird bad guys pocket, and i was desperately waiting for the phone to come into play. It didnt. THis movie is a disgrace to america and will probably spark some sort of middle eastern conflict due to its horribleness. Never buy this movie unless you want to feel really bad about yourself. The plot was awful, they wrote is so poorly, and there are so many unanswered questions. The secret service needs to get its priorities straight and protect the presidents daghuter and not a stupid kid that people doubt. My last concern is to why DL Hugely was even considering taking the role of the secret servie agent. I know hes a no talent actor but he could to a little better.

P.S. If you want a actual movie, watch one with an ape in it, like ED or dunsten checks in",1275436800,,998,4.252631578947368
3658296,5,B001JJMGIU,"Alright, so it's not a 5 star movie....typical 2.5 star kids movie-- but better than the 1 star reviews here.  The title is misleading-- they should have stuck with the original ""Doubting Thomas"" working title, so perhaps the misleading title is the reason for the poor reviews.

For my family the movie was awesome as it was filmed at my kids' school, and neat to see their every day setting in a movie.",1266278400,,404,4.52054794520548
3658297,4,B001JJMGIU,"I first saw previews for this movie through a trailer on a different movie I had bought.  It looked exciting; a kid who goes to a spy school.  However, the movie is not like the trailer.  The school is not a spy school and I don't know why the movie is titled so.  I did enjoy the flick but would caution others to not expect it to be like the trailer or name of the movie.",1261612800,18,373,3.8684210526315788
3658298,1,B001JJMGIU,"When I bought this movie, I was expecting something similar to Agent Cody Banks, but instead it was Big Fat Liar and the very beginning of Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dream. The acting was bad, the casting was bad, the plot, the directing and the music was bad. Anna Sophia Robb is an excellent actress, and did a wonderful job, however, she was the only experienced and decent actress in the whole movie.

I am a big fan of almost all spy books and movies, but this movie had almost no spying in it at all (don't be fooled by the title ""Spy School"").

I was very disappointed with this movie, and would not recommend wasting your money on it.",1245801600,,646,4.2439024390243905

8312981,1,B001JJMGIU,the kids in this movie acted to grown for example in the begging the boy talks about making out with another girl and then the girl who has a crush on him kisses him not on the cheek but on the lips. That's how kids get pregnant trying to grow up to quickly very inappropriate beginning and very bad actors and role models for kids did not watch for more than 2 minute.,1502582400,2,369,4.068493150684931
