7996048,3,B0000A4GCW,"Just started using this tool, and it seems like it will be great for a beginner.",1494892800,,80,4.0625
7996049,5,B0000A4GCW,Great book for the younger players. Great tips and lots of good points!,1447113600,,71,4.538461538461538
7996050,5,B0000A4GCW,"This dvd was very informative and well done. A lot of the things being taught were demonstrated using both professional ball players and children.  It got innto detail on how to cover each base, what you should be thinking about and preparing for at all times and the right and wrong way to do things.  Catching, throwing, use and care of gloves, covering a base, stealing a base, tagging out, where to throw, how to protect eyes from the sun while catching, how the catcher should act and inform the team, all included.  I expected this to be rather borinng but I found it the most interesting of all three dvds (pitching, hitting, fielding).",1361232000,,643,4.62280701754386

7996052,4,B0000A4GCW,"If you are a little league player or if your child is a little league player this book is a must. After giving this book to my grandson, his performance improved as well as the other players on his team that he loaned the video. His coach had a team meeting at a local pizza restaurant and they showed the video on their big screen. Play Ball: Basic Fielding should be on every little league player and little league coach must see list.",1321056000,,437,4.27710843373494
7996053,2,B0000A4GCW,"got this hoping to get my young sons interested in learning the game... but, it's really boring for them. it's all accurate and the techniques that it teaches are important - but my kids tuned out as soon as it started.

there is one with a cartoon mit, ball and bat that has little songs (you'll hate them but your kids will love them) and short scenes that can hold the kids' attention. that one played non-stop in my car this summer. I'd suggest it for kids under 7. it's called Littlest Leaguers Learn to Play Baseball -<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Littlest-Leaguers-Learn-to-Play-Baseball/dp/B00008YLUF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Littlest Leaguers: Learn to Play Baseball</a>",1287273600,,729,5.813084112149533
7996054,5,B0000A4GCW,"My boys, ages 6 and 8, watch this DVD over and over again. We've watched the pitching and hitting DVDs of the series, and they're good, but found this one most thorough and helpful. Covers how to play each position. It does not overwhelm the viewer with too much instruction but gives enough that kids might feel they have an edge over other players. Well worth the money spent.",1230336000,2,378,4.492753623188406
