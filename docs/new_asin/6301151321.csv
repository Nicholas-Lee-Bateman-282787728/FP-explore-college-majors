Andrew Dice CLay is wonderful as the ""Vin Man"" who is really a loving man who just wants to meet the right woman. Hollywood overlooked Andrew Dice Clay's perfect performance & still has not put him in another excellent role that fit him so well & at this point his looks aren't what they were in this 1987 romantic comedy. Victoria Jackson & Lea Thompson are just right in their roles as love-seeking women in the latter 1980's of safe sex- not just to avoid STDS such as the Aids disease but to also avoid getting emotionally involved with the wrong guy- and to avoid getting hurt yet again. This is an excellent comedy on dvd although it has NO extra features so maybe in the future there will be a Special edition as this is already it's 2nd time on dvd.",1058400000,14,920,4.41764705882353
312000,3,6301151321,"In the 1970s women almost eliminated the double-standard on immoral sex.  Before then, people who wouldn't blink at promiscuous men scorned promiscuous women.  With the 1980s came AIDS, and now unwanted pregnancy  was no longer the biggest worry for the fast-lane crowd.  CASUAL SEX tells  the story of two single ladies in the fast lane with an eye on the exit  ramp.  It bounces between corny and funny, with most of the latter due to a  stand-out performance by comedian Andrew Dice Clay.  In addition to Clay,  CASUAL SEX proves worthwhile for the short-lived relationship Lea Thompson  has with whom she thinks is the man of her dreams.  Romance does not turn  out the way we fantasize it to be.",936316800,16,700,4.733333333333333

312064,3,6301151321,"Released in 1988, ""Casual Sex?"" focuses on two young women, Stacy (Lea Thompson) and Melissa (Victoria Jackson), who go to a health resort to find a ""safe"" man in the new era of AIDS. Stacy has a promiscuous past while Melissa is a novice when it comes to sex. The former hooks up with a musician (Stephen Shellen) and the latter a nice guy massage therapist (Jerry Levine). Andrew Dice Clay is also on hand.

This is a fairly amusing 80's romcom with, thankfully, very little raunch despite the title. Although Thompson is her usual winsome petite self she's physically too thin for my tastes; Jackson is better with her irksome nasally voice, but her character is too bimbo-ish. Still, both are likable enough. Amazingly, it's Dice Clay who stands out as Vinny, a particularly annoying guest at the resort, who has an interesting character arc.

The topic of the film -- romance & sex in the 80s -- is told from the woman's point of view and therefore appeals more to women. So the fairer sex will appreciate ""Casual Sex?"" more than I did, but the movie's still worth catching for men because the three male characters ring true and Dice Clay's performance and his character's story arc make the movie worthwhile.

The film runs 97 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles.

With high hopes, Stacy and Melissa embark on their quest to track down The Perfect Man. But unfortunately, the men they encounter seem to wilt at the thought of anything more than...Casual Sex.

The result is a hilariously perceptive comedy that offers a lighter look at what happens in the dark. This comedy flick takes me back to memory lane to when I was 15 years old in my Freshmen year in high school during its theatrical release in the Spring of 1988, so now that one hit oneder song HOT, HOT, HOT by Buster Poindexter makes me think of this movie.",1392163200,,863,4.785234899328859

While Lea Thompson, Victoria Jackson & crew are excellent, Andrew Dice Clay steals this movie hands down! I have not been a fan of his. In fact I have never seen any of his shows, but he was marvelous in this movie.

312139,4,6301151321,"80s teen-movie queen Lea Thompson and Saturday Night Live star Victoria Jackson star in this quaintly nostalgic film which addresses the efficacy of casual sex.  The film is based on a play by the same name, and it came at an interesting juncture in history;  the mid-80s saw the sexual revolution winding down & people were becoming more & more aware of the really nasty STDs being spread around - including the ""brand new"" one known as AIDS.  This caused many people to do a lot of re-thinking about their nocturnal habits, and this is the focus of the present film.

Lea Thompson plays a promiscuous woman who finds herself examing her dangerous practices.  She and her much-less sexually experienced friend (Jackson) take off to spend time at a health spa (another staple of the mid-80s!) to ensure that any men they happen to sleep with will be safe.

While there, they come across an ego maniac from Jersey (played by the venerable Andrew Dice Clay) who believes he knows what women want.  Interestingly, all three characters go through some poignant transformations during the film.

The special features contain an alternate ending.  I'm glad they didn't use it as it was very deus ex machina.  That said, it's still worth viewing as Thompson is a knockout while wearing a wedding dress!

Some may argue that the regular ending is a bit contrived, but I would disagree.  For me, it factored into the whole premise of the plot, which was that the mid-80s was a time in which people needed to look past sex & start thinking more about relationships.  For me, the movie is actually trenchant in its portrayal of how life doesn't always turn out the way we think it will.  People change, and occasionally they even improve upon what they were previously.

As Lea Thompson's #1 fan, I find it my duty to extol all of her movies.  That said, this is a great 80s flick whether you're a big fan of her's or not.  The fact that we get a few shots of both girls' posteriors is an added bonus, although the film shied away from having a whole lot of skin in it (despite several opportunities!).  If you're looking for a Romantic Comedy that can also double as a satire, you can do a lot worse than this one!",1225411200,2,2204,4.564885496183206
312140,3,6301151321,I missed this one when it first come out...so glade to have ran across it. Very enjoyable to watch.,1214697600,,99,4.2631578947368425
312141,4,6301151321,"This largely unappreciated 80's comedy gem deals with the subject of dating and sex during the early days of the AIDS epidemic.  The humour is derived from the experiences of two very different single girls and what happens to their lives after an eventful summer vacation.

Free-spirited Stacy (Lea Thompson) and her timid best friend Melissa (Victoria Jackson) each know the unique joys of casual sex--""This is kind of embarrassing to admit, but I remember when it was actually fun to say, ""WOW, that really felt great! What's your name again?"".

But when Stacy starts reading stories about the growing fear of AIDS, she ponders the loose way in which she has governed her sex-life.  She and Melissa pack up and head to an exclusive health resort where they start exploring the idea of settling down with the perfect Mr. Right.

Based on the book by Wendy Goldman and Judy Toll, CASUAL SEX? is one of those classic 80's comedies where everyone seems to remember the movie poster, but not the film itself.  That's a real shame, because the film still offers valuable opinions and ideas about dating and sex in a world where those activities hold very real dangers.  That said, the movie is still hilariously funny, with Thompson and Jackson both incredibly-talented actresses who totally engage the audience with their thoughtful performances.

Co-starring Andrew 'Dice' Clay, Stephen Shellen, Mary Gross and Jerry Levine, CASUAL SEX? is a must for 80's movie lovers and those wanting to see a very intelligent romantic comedy about sexual mores in the decade where innocence was truly lost forever.

The DVD is stacked with a few worthwhile extras, like deleted scenes and an alternate ending.  (Single-sided, dual-layer disc).",1213574400,3,1729,5.035087719298246
312142,1,6301151321,"I can't believe a star of Lea Thompson's caliber or such a controversial comic like Andrew Dice Clay would agree to star in this film. It tries to make a dark humorous statement about AIDS in the 80s and fails. Dice-Clay's character is likeable, but your stereotypical Jersey guy, and I can't believe he agreed to recite such idiotic lines.
While the beginning of the film is ok, it quickly disintegrates into mindless dribble. I get this impression this film was targeted at the adolescent male audience, with lots of sex and some nudity thrown in for good measure. Predictable and formulaic, this tacky little film is not worth your money. What a shame that the talented cast of this film had to utter such stupid, inane dialogue. How amazing that such a ridiculous, badly written script was made into a movie.",1141430400,6,812,4.725352112676056
312143,5,6301151321,"Stacy Hunter and Melissa Halpern are best friends that share a common problem: sex. Stacy is a fun, flirtacious, woman who is regretting her reckless sexual past. Melissa is a nice, down-to-earth Kindergarten teacher who has only slept with two men in her life, and wants ""a nice guy"".
Suggesting a vacation, the girls jet off to Oasis Health Spa, to look for healthy young men. There they meet Vinny,(Andrew Dice Clay) who automaticly sets his sights on Stacy. However, Stacy has her sights set on Nick (Stephen Shellen), a musician who works at the spa. Melissa also has her eye on someone, a therapist, Matthew (Peter Dvorsky).  Melissa is not aware, however, that Jamie (Jerry Levine), a nutritionist, has a very big crush on her.
Mary Gross (Ilene), Valeri Breiman (Megan), David Sargent (Frankie), and others wind up this ensemble cast for one of the funnies comedies ever to be released. I am not a big fan of the ""Dice Man"", but this is probably the best acting he's ever done, and possibly the best film he's ever made. You won't be disppointed.",1127779200,4,1054,4.728260869565218

312145,3,6301151321,"The movie, which stars Victoria Jackson (Melissa) and Lea Thompson (Stacey), involves the two twenty-something year old bachlorettes going on vacation at a health resort in hopes of meeting Mr. Right.  Each woman has a different story, with Melissa being slightly repressed and only having slept with 2 guys in her life, and Stacey being a formerly promiscuous girl who is trying to change her lifestyle.

Because of its title, the picture on the box cover, the obscure description on the back of the box, and the inclusion of the infamous Andrew Dice Clay, you might expect this movie to be filled with formulaic sexual hi-jinks and crude humor.  Furthermore, because of the time period in which the movie was released, you might also expect it to be somewhat dated.

This movie turns out to be quite a nice suprise, dealing with some issues that are contemporary (such as AIDS) and some that are timeless (such as rushing into committments) in a fairly tactful way.  Aside from some brief nudity, the movie, I think is appropriate and informative for teenagers who are about to venture out into the dating world.

Thompson's character is especially interesting in that she is afraid of the AIDS-risk that comes with casual sex and, accordingly, wants a long term relationship.  But, due to her apprehensions, she rushes headfirst into a committment with a guy who turns out to be a very handsome, but unrealistic slacker.  She takes a step toward maturity and shows strength in breaking the committment before it goes too far.  Jackson's character is less interesting.

In sum, I would not recommend this movie as a romantic comedy, and its definitely not a Spring Break flick.  The acting isn't that great either.  However, if you have a teenage daughter, I think the film is a highly approriate and didactic story about the complexities involved with being single.",1091836800,13,1868,4.914012738853503
