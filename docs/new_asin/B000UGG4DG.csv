8213218,4,B000UGG4DG,"""Hungry for You"" is your standard erotic fantasy/thriller starring the incredibly sexy Rochelle Swanson.  I'll admit, I took a chance in purchasing this title specifically because Ms. Swanson stars in it.  I  was as interested in the plot/storyline as I was in the obvious erotic elements.  While from a general cinematic point-of-view, the premise has been done to death (watch the SciFi channel, and I'm sure you'll run into a movie with a similar plotline), from an erotic thriller perspective the story was above average.

The story is set in the near future, and people seek adventure via virtual reality (""VR"").  Sexual VR is against the law except in Nevada, and anyone broadcasting or engaging in it outside of Nevada is sentenced to five years of sensory deprivation.  In this case, various men are viewing VR scenarios (skydiving, gunfights, car racing, etc.), when all of a sudden a woman (Rochelle Swanson) suddenly appears in the simulation; sexually engages the viewer; then proceeds to have virtual intercourse with them.  The viewer knows it's against the law and should not be part of the program.  But come on, it's Rochelle Swanson; no man is going to turn her down.  When the man reaches his sexual apex, an electrical impulse shoots through the VR googles into his eyes, killing him.  A former cop and FCC investigator is brought in to solve the mystery: how are these men dying?  Who's behind their deaths?  Who's broadcasting sexual VR scenarios?  Why these particular men?  It is a mystery involving government duplicity, corporate coverups, blackmail and revenge.  Despite the common flaws associated with low-budget softcore cinema, (poor acting, obvious plot developments, shallow characters, etc.) ""Hungry for You"" was surprisingly entertaining.

There are a few points I wanted to bring up:

1) The disk menu and cover art is in spanish, but the sound is in English.  You may have to turn off the spanish subtitles, but that's minor.  And the menu is not so difficult that you can't tell ""play"" from ""scene selection"" from ""return.""  Knowing spanish is not required.  In my opinion, the disk quality is excellent.

2) Unlike many other softcore films I've seen, especially MRG-produced films shown on CineMax, there is not as much sexual content as I was accustomed to.  There were only five scenes (all involving Ms. Swanson), and two of them were halted to further the storyline. That's not to say that the ones shown weren't good.  There just wasn't as many scenes.  Plus, the scenes aren't as ""animated"" as CineMax sex scenes demonstrate. They were in slow erotic mode consistent with movies produced by Mystique Films (I measure quality of sexual content to the films produced by MGR or Mainline Releasing, the films commonly shown on CineMax). But don't think the scenes are in any way inferior; they were terrific, and Ms. Swanson was spectacular.  I guess I got used to the simulated sexual activity to be as realistic as it's demonstrated on CineMax.  It's a little more muted, but still great.  I think that's the result of some effort actually being placed on the storyline.

3) Despite my being captivated by the storyline, the acting was weak, even by softcore standards.  The main character, the investigator, did this Mike Hammer-like narration and persona which was the hammiest and worst dialogue I've ever heard.  Clearly the person who wrote the script fancies him/herself as some classic mystery writer, when they're just making the character sound like an idiot.  The other characters were somewhat over the top, but fine.  I know I shouldn't expect so much from erotic thrillers, but even they should have their standards and make a reasonable effort.

4) The special effects were lousy, but an aficionado of erotic thrillers will allow that; I will too.

5) The ending was a major letdown, which was unfortunate, given that I was captivated by the mystery.  The producers and writers seem to put a fair amount of effort in making the story interesting, only to solve the mystery with a proposterous, idiotic and cliched ending.  I was very disappointed.

Overall, I was as captivated by the storyline as I was in the erotic content, something I never expected to happen.  If you're not a lover of softcore cinema, then don't bother buying this.  This genre is not about quality acting, well-developed characters, crisp dialogue or superior production value.  It's meant to show very attractive people engage the base desires of the viewer via non-graphic sexual activity.  ""Hungry for You"" falls within that catergory.  But I was not simply looking for the next sexual scene; I really wanted the mystery solved.  On that basis, I give the movie four stars.",1203984000,2,4708,4.987163029525032
