It has come to scenic places that are unprepared to deal with mining on such a large scale. The resource is worth billions of dollars to the oil industry. Often people don't realize how much there is to lose until it's too late. This documentary has quite a bit of footage of people in the middle of figuring things out. People who want to cash in and people stuck in bad situations. This is part of the oil drilling story that is seldom told. Easy to watch and very informative.",1440028800,,582,4.339449541284404
