8072245,5,B000A1OFXC,"I was in Iraq when these events took place. I was with the 4th Infantry stationed in Tikrit in 2003. I was in an Aviation unit refueling helicopters. I saw this program on the Military channel many times. I'm now glad to say not only do I have this documentary, but I can also say my actions in some small way, led to his capture.",1318723200,2,330,4.092307692307692
8072246,5,B000A1OFXC,"This fascinating film would be of interest to anyone in the military, anyone in law enforcement, any history buff, or anyone intent on learning more about Saddam Hussein and his fall from power.  It's a relatively short film, one that could easily be shown in a class or watched over and over to get the full impact.  One tidbit that I especially enjoyed was learning that Saddam Hussein's favorite Hollywood movie was The Godfather.  His family truly was one big crime family, and there are still some of his family at large.",1313539200,,526,4.695652173913044
