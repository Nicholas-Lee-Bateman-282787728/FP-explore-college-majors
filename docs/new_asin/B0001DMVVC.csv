1991809,1,B0001DMVVC,"I was very disappointed with this purchase.  In fact, I viewed three of them and the quality is so poor the rest will remain on the shelf unviewed. I have relied on internet sales for two years now, and this is the worst.",1167782400,11,221,4.1395348837209305
1991810,4,B0001DMVVC,"I've bought the Classic Movies, the Comedy set, and the musical set, and they are worth the cost.  Stage Door Canteen from the musical set, the sound is a little off, but all in all, worth the cost.",1165536000,,198,4.2105263157894735
1991811,5,B0001DMVVC,"i own many of these sets and like most of them. this set is very good. i don't know if i got lucky or what, but all the transfers look very good,not great,but very good. there are some fun movies on this collection,and as the title says they are family friendly.",1145923200,43,262,4.1568627450980395
1991812,5,B0001DMVVC,"Ive purchased a few from this series of boxed sets--it's a great way to pick up decent B-movies that may be of interest and some older A films that have fallen off the radar. These films have not been fussed over or remastered, so quality is variable and that's OK. Generally, for the cost, you'll get more-then-adequately rewarded. It's all similar to old late-night TV fare back in the pre-cable days.

I was a little disturbed by one of the reviews below complaining that one of the discs had ""worn out."" DVDs don't wear out. They can get mightily scratched up and that can cause trouble; that's an issue here since these are all double-sided discs and must be handled carefully. Also, significant dirt on the surfaces can unbalance them and cause some deterioration of image and sound quality. Allegedly, the materials within the disc may decay but there's talk of that happening after many decades or even longer. Still, in the immediate sense, DVDs don't wear out. Of course, players too can develop problems. Please don't let that comment dissuade you from considering this good bargain.",1136505600,154,1094,4.850267379679145

1991814,5,B0001DMVVC,"I bought this collection last Christmas (about 9 months ago), and have finally watched all the films.  I watched them when I found a couple hours here-and-there of down time.  Seeing as I have never seen 95% of these, it was a real treat.  Only one movie was so bad, that I couldn't finish it (Long John Silver).  The rest varied from good to excellent.  Just picked up the 50 pack of westerns, and am looking to watching all of them too. You'll probably see my review to that about 9 months from now (chuckle).",1097107200,89,511,4.336842105263158

Hey! This is before they had dolby, hi-fi and all that! I assume most of the negative reviews come from younger folks who were raised on HD TV! I haven't had any problem listening or watching any of these movies! Sure there are a few places where there might have been a film splice, or the sound may be less than 2015 standards, but it's nothing that's really going to bother anyone except for the spoiled younger generation!

There are quite a few black and white movies in this pack, which unfortunately are blurred.  Very tough to watch.  The color selections are fine but there are fewer of those than the blurry ones.  It does not have to do with the year it was filmed, it appears, as older color movies in this set are clearer than newer black and white choices.

1991911,2,B0001DMVVC,"The Dentist, has sexual innuendos and some inappropriate viewing for children.  The patient ends up wrapped around Fields with both legs around his middle and arms around him in an embrace as if having sex.  There are several other scenes of women bent over and him commenting on their behinds.  Wasn't a funny movie at all.  Nor a family movie, as the set is labeled.  If you comment me saying that I read into the Dentist what's not there, and that I have a dirty mind, well, you can think that, but I screen movies before my family watches them, and I'm hoping others do, too, and would appreciate the information.  I have not viewed the other Fields movies, but I remember from my childhood 40 years ago, that I wasn't allowed to watch his movies for this reason, so I probably won't waste my time on the other Fields movies.

Also, one movie that is listed in my booklet (The Admiral was a Lady) is not included, instead, the movie Father's Little Dividend is in its place.  This movie you can hardly see as it is such poor quality.  When I opened it, the box was broken inside.  The discs are in loose sleeves and have labels in small print, very inconvenient to search for a movie.

There is some pixel distortion at times.  I know this because I had to stop, rewind and start again to get rid of it.  So, it seems this Mill Creek Entertainment is cheap and uses bad quality materials.  Sad.  I only paid 12.99 so I will probably get my money's worth as my daughter loves Shirley Temple, and there are some true classics in here, but be informed before you buy this set!",1293840000,10,1577,4.371134020618556
1991912,3,B0001DMVVC,"There is no doubt that there are many very good films in this lot, which provides sunday-afternoon style entertainment for my family when we have tired of Harry Potter or Star Wars after seemingly endless viewings.  We can meander through the list of films and pick something that strikes us, such as the Scarlet Letter (of 1936) or the Africa Screams by Abbot and Costello.  For want of a better term, these viewings introduce my kids to some of the culture I used to watch on TV in the 60s.  Of course, half the time they say that the films are too stupid to continue to watch (e.g. the East Side Boys), but I am glad to have the chance to expose them to Charlie Chaplin (The Kid, a genuine classic), WC Fields, Shirley Temple, or Buster Keaton.  We even talk about how acting was different, as in pre-method acting, so it is stimulating.  While the price is right, the quality of the dvds leaves something to be desired - on our HDTV, they often look crude and grainy.

Recommended.  It is a good deal and while many of the versions are obscure, there are real gems here to explore.",1287532800,5,1085,4.395

Well, as far as the quality of the video goes, I'd have to say it is pretty good. Since the movies are from so long ago, the quality isn't going to be high def. or anything....haha  Another thing that's pretty cool is the fact that they got all those movies on 12 DVDs (2 movies per side).  Only thing I see wrong with this pack is, the list of the movies on the package says that ""THE JUNGLE BOOK"" is in there(It's not).  There is another movie(not listed on box)in it's place called ""THE GENERAL"".  If you're are into old movies or know somebody old....You'll enjoy this pack of movies.

I get the feeling I am there in the time without all the high gloss of today's grand ""events"".

This set offers at least a half dozen good movies that sold for at least five or more dollars and you may still see some of them sold independently. In addition you have some good Three Stooges thrown in as well. This is one of the few fifty movie sets I recommend. To top it off it is nicely boxed. The outer cover has a velcro closure to keep in the discs with there cardboard sleeves. Each disc has about four movies or shorts and the sleeves give the titles and a about a paragraph description. The quality of the discs is fair to good. Certainly as good as buying the individual titles in plastic covers for $5.99-6.99. I am really pleased with this set.,1182729600,38,786,4.246666666666667
