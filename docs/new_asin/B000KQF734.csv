This story is a great history lesson for everyone.",1182470400,7,205,4.394736842105263
2697025,1,B000KQF734,"If you enjoy pathos in its simple and variant hues you should enjoy this movie; other wise, not much of historical reality into it nor dynamics in emotions or visual scenes.",1171238400,,173,4.612903225806452
8158679,5,B000KQF734,Very powerful movie.,1481068800,,20,6.0
8158680,5,B000KQF734,Was a history teacher and used to show this to my classes when I lectured about this topic. All I had was an old VHS copy and wanted to update it to a DVD. It was still very compelling and this fire started hundreds of many needed reforms in the industry as well as the city/country.,1470009600,,283,4.071428571428571

8158683,3,B000KQF734,"I remember when I saw this on TV years ago. But $349.00 is just ""slightly"" more then I think its worth.",1300924800,2,103,3.9523809523809526
8158684,5,B000KQF734,"This movie presents a visual image of women working long hours in unsafe conditions, and the deadly Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911.",1273968000,3,141,5.173913043478261
8158685,5,B000KQF734,THIS IS A WONDERFUL FACT BASED STORY ABOUT A TRAGEDY.  I ENJOYED IT THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT ON TV AND AM SO GLAD THAT I PURCHASED IT TO WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN.,1223769600,3,162,3.6285714285714286
8158686,1,B000KQF734,"I read two excellent books on this infamous and historically significant tragedy.  I then noticed this movie.  I was sadly disappointed (so much so that I returned 4 copies I had purchased as gifts).  The movie was not true to the facts.  Besides taking ""creative license"", the movie lacks good effects and dramatization.  For instance, when the many people jumped off the building, the movie fails to include any sound effect of them hitting the ground (that sound was one of the most widely reported aspects to the news articles written by reporters on the scene).  Overall, the movie was contrived, corny, and poorly made.",1214438400,2,625,4.904761904761905
8158687,1,B000KQF734,Not a video worthy of watching. It's more of a soap opera than a historical recreation.,1213574400,,87,4.5
8158688,5,B000KQF734,I remember when this first aired on TV and I liked it alot. It's hard to find seems extremely rare! Worth a Viewing. Bought it to see if I still like it as much as I remember its first airing on TV.,1208044800,4,198,3.738095238095238
