8210943,4,B000TUASPS,"Other than the fact that this movie was a joint Spanish-Japanese co-production, I never did quite get the title. Very possibly that has something to do with my admittedly weak grasp of Spanish. Still, that disjunction did not particularly detract from my enjoyment of this grim, violent, sleazy mid-'80s Euro-thriller.

This one's got it all, pretty much: exotic locales (Spain, Egypt, Turkey, etc. - all beautifully photographed by Naschy regular Julio Burgos (""Panic Beats""); graphic gun violence (LOTS of gooshy squibs), including a gory, slow motion sawed-off shotgun blast to the midsection of a naked woman (who then goes through a plate glass window); many, many hot women, a lot of whom get fully, frontally nude; a Nazi era back story for Naschy's grim-faced assassin; and a bleak, nihilistic finale to stand with the best of the lead's work.

Not everybody's cup of tea, of course, but if you're a Naschy fan (this dude is INtense) or just like '80s Euro-thrillers that are on the unforgiving side, then you owe it to yourself to check this one out.",1346803200,,1059,4.943820224719101
