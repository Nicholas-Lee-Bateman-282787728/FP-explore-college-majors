7386069,5,B014DEGUIE,"Some Kind of Beautiful Stars Pierce Brosnan as a college professor named Richard Haig who tries to initially seduce Olivia (Salma Hayek) while still dating her grad student sister Kate (Jessica Alba).  Admittedly, Richard did not know at first that Olivia and Kate were related when he first laid eyes on Olivia inside a fancy looking Dublin hotel (or was it a bar/restaurant as well). Anyhow, this is the least of his worries as Olivia meets up with both Kate and Richard while discussing her love life with author Alan Sloane (Robert Mailhouse). Richards father Gordon (Malcolm McDowell) foreshadows the scandal that is about to happen by the way that Richard and Gordon say goodbye to each other. Olivia politely avoids telling Kate about Richard hitting on her at their first actual meeting. However, this is the least of Richards worries as he finds out that Kate is pregnant and is about to have his baby.  Kate got a job with a venture firm in Los Angeles and successfully persuades Richard to follow her to California (which seems easy enough because Richard considers Kate beautiful, ambitious, and bright).  Things start out idyllic when Kate gives birth to their baby Jake (Duncan Joiner). However, Richards life gets turned upside down when Kate decides to leave him for another man named Brian (Ben MacKenzie).  Around this time, Olivia catches her writer amour with her gynecologist (she finds out later that her writer man only went with her to the gynecologist sessions to see the gynecologist). Olivia creatively channels some of that heartache towards becoming a writer herself.",1440633600,2,1596,5.011320754716981

7386166,2,B014DEGUIE,"It was ok. I liked the actors but the storyline was lame and while the intention was a humorous film, I found it to be dull. A little kid repeating swear words might be quite funny to a 16 year old but less funny to a more adult audience. Yet the subject and content seems to be geared to an adult audience.  So if you've been told or think you enjoy juvenile humor,  this might be a good movie. I give this a 2 1/2 starts rating for the actors,  they tried hard.",1449964800,3,463,3.956989247311828

7386181,4,B014DEGUIE,"When he's given the right script (and Matthew Newman is the clever scribe whose done the good deed on this one) - Pierce Brosnan can be a joy to watch and shows acting-chops and depth that few critics give him enough credit for.

""Lessons In Love"" (called ""Some Kind Of Beautiful"" in the USA) will probably divide watcher camps - those who loved it - and those who feel it clichd and derivative etc. It's both of course (and more) - but with a cleverly chosen cast all showing actual chemistry together (the stunning Salma Hayek and Jessica Alba in particular) - genuinely zippy moments with a fair share of pure star quality and charm from Pierce and Salma - when ""Lessons In Love"" is good - it's a lovely watch and a hugely enjoyable one too.

A teacher in Cambridge who specialises in the Romantic Poets - Brosnan's character Richard is an ageing lothario more comfortable bedding his students for short spurts than actually forming a real relationship with them. When his current gorgeous young squeeze of six months blurts out that she's pregnant (Jessica Alba as Kate) - Richard probably regrets the chemistry between him and her older and more suitable sister Olivia (Salma Hayek's character) that he met at a hotel bar by chance. But Richard wants to do the right thing for once - so soon he's committing to the younger-woman relationship with Kate - flying to California to teach and be a Dad - and a year later - is peering down at a beautiful son he thought he'd never have.

Four or five years go by - and although his American students aren't interested in his 'romantic poets' lectures (more worried about their Wi-Fi connection) - at least his relationship with his bubbly young son is flourishing (a fantastically touching turn by young Duncan Joiner as Jake). But that bigger and seriously gorgeous sister chemistry between Richard and Olivia just keeps on interfering and cropping up despite the fact that Olivia says she 'despises' Richard. And maybe younger mummy Kate (Alba) has grown affectionate towards someone else too who isn't British and old like Richard - which will set many relationship cats amongst the wine-drinking pigeons...

The jokes are good - the dialogue is often sharp, brutally honest and life observant (Malcolm McDowell in a wickedly good turn as the curmudgeonly English father who has lived his commitment-free life to a fleshy heathenish excess) and the 'romance will win out in the end' theme runs throughout the story without being overly sappy. You even get the lovely Marlee Martin at an AA meeting. The BLU RAY picture is gorgeous throughout (picturesque British and American locations) - but it's a damn shame that there are little more than chapters and subtitles  a 'Making Of' would have been a nice cherry on the cake here (looks like the whole cast really enjoyed themselves).

Give ""Lessons In Love"" a punt  a very warm watch indeed. While you're at it check out Pierce's superb finding-love-late-in-life duet with the lovely Swedish actress Trine Dyrholm in the wonderfully touching ""Love Is All You Need""  another romantic story for persons of a certain age...",1449100800,2,3121,4.842401500938086

The plot turned on the immigration status of the Pierce Brosnan character and they got all of that completely wrong.  Which isn't uncommon in films, but with all of the debates about immigration today, and with so much ignorance about the realities of U.S. immigration law, I feel like filmmakers have some kind responsibility to the truth, even in a silly romantic comedy like this one.",1448064000,2,485,4.694117647058824

Jessica Alba looked great and Selma Hayek looked fantastic, ... as usual. For me, the two ladies earned this movie an extra star or two. Pierce Brosnan may do the same for the ladies but, honestly, to me, he's starting to look a little ""long in the tooth"". Sorry, Pierce Brosnan just isn't Sean Connery.",1446940800,3,445,4.717948717948718

7386206,3,B014DEGUIE,"You can leave me, but I am not leaving that boy. Richard (Brosnan) is a college professor who teaches the classics and has a young and beautiful wife. When he finds out she is leaving him his life is shattered. He throws everything into his son and trying to get a new job. Things get complicated when he starts to notice Olivia (Hayek) in a different way and a problem with his Visa comes up. Now Richard must try to get a job, stay in the country, and find love with someone he never expected to. Judging by the synopsis you may think this sounds like a cookie cutter movie, and your right. The movie is pretty predictable and not original but it is funny and very watchable. Pierce Brosnan is a great choice for this and he really saves the movie from being something overly generic. There really isn't a whole lot to say about this since there has been a million movies with this same idea but even so this is still a good movie and defiantly worth a watch. I did like it but I am also a big Pierce Brosnan fan. Overall, nothing original but entertaining and funny. Worth seeing at least once. I give this a B.",1446768000,7,1114,4.259433962264151

7386290,2,B014DEGUIE,"This movie has a great cast and a great lead in story line - student falls for professor, gets pregnant, then professor falls for student's sister - and had the potential to be a much better than average romantic comedy. I was really enjoying the movie through most of the first half, but for some very strange, bizarre, and unknown reason, the movie turned into a script and story-line disaster and quickly made me cringe, boo, and hope for a quick end to a plot gone array. How does it help the movie to paint Pierce Bronson's character as such a pathetic loser that you would never believe that any woman (let alone a sexy Latina bombshell like Salma Hayek) would want anything to do with him. Let's not even begin to venture into why the writer would expect us to believe that Jessica Alba's character has the right to get upset to find out that her estranged husband had sex with her older half-sister when the man she secretly cheated on her husband with was sitting right across the table! It looks like a script that was written with humor, smart-sexiness, and potential was handed off to a nincompoop ignoramus halfway through. What an eventual waste of talented, sexy, funny, good-looking actors. What looked like the beginnings of an entertaining romantic comedy ended up becoming just plane stupid and irritating. Too bad too, because the characters were played (at the beginning anyway) as quite lovable. Jessica Alba was her usual beautiful self, but Salma was downright super-sexy and an all-out delicious seductress. Most of her scenes burned up the screen. As always, Salma's onscreen presence oozes with Latin Fire, although she looks so much like my own wife, I might actually be a bit bias in my appreciation of her beauty. If you like Salma enough to suffer through a progressively deteriorating script, don't miss her in this - but if that's your interest, no need to watch after the scene where their steamy affair gets exposed. After that point (and even a bit before, to be honest) it's all down the drain. Pierce Bronson is the quintessential suave British Professor and you do enjoy his character until, of course, he becomes Super-Looser. The little boy who plays Bronson and Alba's son is too cute and most of his scenes are adorable, but even his character suffers when the script overplays it. I think you can get my drift. If you are fans of Pierce Bronson, Jessica Alba and especially Salma Hayek you may like the first part of this movie. It does give fans some good screen play, but be prepared to eventually get disgusted with the plot and script. One last bit of advice. Unless you really need to see some sexy scenes with Salma Hayek right away, don't pay $6.99 to rent it now, wait until it gets added to Prime as a free selection.",1442793600,15,2770,4.666666666666667

7386292,1,B014DEGUIE,Crude. Offensive. Disgusting.  I thought it was a romantic comedy.  There was nothing cute about it. It has crude cussing throughout and vulgar sex scenes with different women.  A waste of money.,1442534400,2,195,5.03125

I have seen a lot of lazy movies. I have seen a lot of bad movies. This movie is in a league of its own.
The plot is horrible; things simply do not make any sense. Acting is atrocious; all of the main actors should find new careers.
It seems like the movie was written and shot in a month.
Please save your time and money and don't watch this horrendous sham of a movie.",1442102400,,480,3.9587628865979383
7386308,3,B014DEGUIE,"This movie was okay but could have been much more.  It has an interesting premise and a great cast, but unfortunately the writing does not give the actors very much to work with.  The pacing is slow at times and some of the attempts at humor fall a bit short.  I didn't think it was as bad as some others did, but I was hoping for more given the cast.  I read that it was shot in a mere 25 days, which unfortunately shows at times, but it may still work as a rental if you are a fan of any of the main actors.",1441929600,,509,3.8190476190476192
