7883136,5,6305022704,Having been a child of the eighties in the UK. This film was an inspiration in the coming out process for me. For years I struggled with being accepted.  This film showed me that it was ok to feel the way I did. Very moving story about 2 guys from London who have to cope with the non acceptance of being gay in the 80s.  I shed a tear when I watch this film and think back on how difficult it was to be true to yourself then.  I hold this film close to my heart and hope that an audience of today will understand what we had to go through to find anyone who felt the same.  A classic and one of importance in my coming out.,1110067200,,624,3.8515625
