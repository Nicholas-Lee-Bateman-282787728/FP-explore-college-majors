8246209,1,B0012JG19C,Not much else to say.  I didn't even bother to watch until the end.  And I like vampire movies most of the time.,1376179200,,112,3.8260869565217392
8246210,1,B0012JG19C,"Just received this movie (if you can call it that).  If people are thinking that this is an vampire hunter movie, they might as well look elsewhere.  A lot of this movie is shot in 8mm and just thrown together.

Really, I'm not even sure what the plot of this movie is purported to be.  (I only watched about a half hour of it and then took it out and put it on the shelf for my movies to give away.)

This is obviously one of the worst movies I have ever purchased and I would give it a ""O"" out of 5, but I see you have to give it at least a 1.",1202342400,,545,3.7043478260869565
