7889883,3,6305484465,"Perhaps I was a bit peeved about having customs duty slapped on this item (Chameleon 3 was ordered, also on videocassette, and arrived in the same parcel), which never happened with my DVD purchases.  A good transfer to digital format would improve it for today's viewers, and the story, slightly derivative of ""Terminator"" (Arnie upgrades himself from robotic killing machine to a more humanised version in T2), is similarly well laid out.
There seems to be an awful lot of time spent on the boy, fleeing with damning evidence about the Corporation's corrupt scientist who played God and fostered its genetically enhanced female police agent (Bobbie Phillips). What the guy does not count on however is that her dormant maternal instincts are awakened and she becomes the kid's AWOL protector instead of handing him in.  Phillips is at her prettiest and the main reason to watch this as I'm sure most would agree.
In trying to think of what IS different about its 'look' I realised that it was a quite ambitious co-production shot in Australia (the marathon Xena series was done in New Zealand), bankrolled partly presumably by TV-Exec Americans.",1363219200,,1147,5.0
7889884,5,6305484465,"This made-for-TV movie was a great movie, it gave my wife an interest in the matrix long before it was released, and albeit it never made a DVD release to date, it still has a great 1990's portrayal of the chameleon effects where she blends into the background, and the character development of Cam was very well done, showing a move from a cold and calculating soldier to a caring warrior woman defending her cub, in oh so many words. I recommend this to anyone who likes sexy strong women, and science fiction, the story can just grip you and keep you in it long after the movie is over.",1296518400,,589,4.363636363636363
7889885,2,6305484465,bobbie phillips is a cute young actress.. so hot a really doll babe,1146787200,2,67,4.230769230769231
7889886,5,6305484465,"I first fell in love when I saw this beautiful woman step off a plane in the television drama ""Murder One"".  I had to see more after the series ended.  ""Chameleon"" was a completely different turn for this fine actress and she was INCREDIBLE!  This movie has action, terrific special effects, and SUPERB acting.  I highy recommend this film.",1018051200,4,340,4.711864406779661
7889887,3,6305484465,it borrows heavy from the anime ghost in the shell.all in all not bad.bobbi phillips is soooo fine for a white women,1016064000,,116,4.318181818181818
7889888,1,6305484465,"Any male whose red blood is flowing hot with hopes of seeing more than the bare back of the voluptuous Ms. Phillips, is going to be sorely disappointed with this waste of film.  The ""R"" rating is, at best, a tease (and I don't mean STRIP tease).  The blocking the director used to prevent any ""R"" quality nudity was so contrived as to be laughable.  The special effects were stolen from ""Predator"" but not improved upon and the plot wouldn't hold the interest of a 5th grader.",1010275200,4,476,4.448275862068965
7889889,5,6305484465,"This isn't a sci-fi movie that has big names attached to it. In fact there isn't a single name I knew when I decided to watch it the other night on cable.  All I can say is what an EXCELLENT choice I made. This was a great movie, with a great-unknown cast that impressed me big-time. Bobbie Phillips was hot, hot, hot as the genetically altered human with the funky name of Kam, short for Chameleon who finds that she is becoming more human after meeting up with a small boy whose parents she has just help kill.  Going on the run with the boy, (he is the key to bringing down world governments on an ecomomic level because he has a special electronic chip his father gave him before he was murdered) Kam's maternal instincts are aroused and she fiercely protects the child in an almost Riplieque (See Aliens)way but without too much gratuitious violence.  There are no surprises as such in this movie but it moves along at a good pace, and there are quality bad guys and quality mystical good guys to give it a bit of extra spice.  All the same ""CHAMELEON"" is surprisingly stylish for a movie without the pull of any real big names. There are some good action scenes; a modicum of suspense and Kam certainly knows her martial arts! The special effects are pretty good, nothing too spectacular but hey, this isn't a film with a 30 million dollar budget after all. This is a film well worth watching if you want some quality acting, a simple story line and some nice scenery. I think it will do well on DVD, especially if they are some deleted scenes that could be added to it as a bonus.",998870400,12,1587,4.3694915254237285
7889890,5,6305484465,"I rented this movie not expecting much. Boy was I wrong! Sure, the plot is nothing new but the actress Bobbie Phillips was so wonderful I couldn't take my eyes off the screen!  She is not only beautiful but one of the most believable and wonderful actresses I've ever seen!",998265600,3,273,4.46
