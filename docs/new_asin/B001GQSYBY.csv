The US government employs these specially trained people to infiltrate the minds of the bad guys, but a conspiracy develops and no one is safe. While being interrogated, our lead character flashes back about how he gets in trouble, handles the dream infiltration project and tries to help the good guys.

The DVD is bare bones and runs at 68 minutes long. The cover art never happens in the film but it looks fun. Taking out the credit sequence and multiple reused footage shots, it is less than an hour long. The film quality is miserable and the sound was remixed with various recording devices, so the dubbing looked horrendous and the interlaced static was grinding at best. The acting was average for what was asked, but more times than not the over-performing was distracting and painful. Every subplot is left hanging, including the love story, but they gave it a valiant try.

Plenty of chance for a big-budget remake here, would be R for nudity and violence.",1239408000,4,1108,4.765625
