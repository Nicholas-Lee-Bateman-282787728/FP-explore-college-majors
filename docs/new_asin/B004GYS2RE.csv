The woman are ok looking the brown haired Paula looks better than the blonde one but all they do is dance around and kiss, it's STUPID save your money I love Franco's movie's and that crazy psychedelic eurotrash but avoid this.",1454025600,,434,4.240963855421687
8429089,2,B004GYS2RE,Someone was on some serious acid when they decided to A.  Come up with the idea.  B.  Convince someone else (probably also on acid) to put up the money for it & finally C.  Convince the actresses to do this cause it will blow your mind.  It actually made my head hurt to watch it.  Plenty of chunky nudity & a lesbian scene or 2.  I cant remember.  That's how weird it was.,1356048000,4,373,4.013698630136986
8429090,4,B004GYS2RE,"Here we have Director Jesus Franco's last film to date 'PAULA.PAULA'-2010 and it is a bold culmination of his last shot-on-video excursions of the past decade. The DVD box describes the film as an Audiovisual experience and it truly is but what we have here is all of the specific arts that Franco loves : art in the way he has visual setups resembling the works of Salvador Dali, M.C. Escher, the psychedelics of Peter Max and the erotic photography of Helmut Newton; literature by focusing the main point of the film based on author Robert Lewis Stevenson's 'DR. JEKYLL & MR. HYDE'; and music by Austrian Jazz pianist Friedrich Guida who Franco used to score his film 'NECRONOMICON' aka 'SUCCUBUS'-1967 which is performed by musicians that Franco selected. All of these elements plus his love of the female body make a brilliant stew for an unusual cinematic 65 minutes.  There is no plot but imagine Dr. Jekyll as a woman going through mental deterioration externalizing Mrs. Hyde and having an erotically murderous encounter and you have the gist of Franco's vision, some viewers may look at it as a music video for Guida, others as a redundant excuse for soft core porn but it is much more than that and the film needs to be viewed by blanking out everything we expect from contemporary cinema.  The lead actress is the incredible Carmen Montes who also graced Franco's 'SNAKE WOMAN'-2005 and her nemesis is played by Paula Davis.  There is a cameo from Franco's muse Lina Romay as a detective and this may be her last appearance to date before her untimely death this past year. Intervision releases it in a 1.85 transfer in Spanish with English Subtitles.  It has interviews with the master listed separately so you can click on what you prefer to view.  One is Franco's take on contemporary filmmaking which clocks in at over 25 minutes and the other is an intro and comments on 'PAULA, PAULA' seeing that Franco conducted this interview 30 minutes after he completed the film so he looks rather tired and even he thinks this is his most bizarre film ever.  For his age, he has an incredible mind. Be warned, if you are not familiar with Franco's newer style , you may feel you have wasted your money.  For me, it looks like I will be going back to this many times in the future not only for its music score but for its pace and vision as it emerges as the directors catharsis in his autumn years.  Franco states he was happy with the freedom he had in creating it and will be making more films soon.  Lets hope that the  tragic death of Lina Romay will make him continue to surprise and titillate his audiences and fans for years to come.",1344988800,6,2647,4.577167019027484
8429091,5,B004GYS2RE,"I must say that this is one of Franco's more interesting films. It has no plot to speak of or a storyline for that matter. It is a dream within a dream. My understanding of the film is that it is all from the perspective of the main character, Paula (with the brown hair), as she descends into utter madness because of her obsessions. It reminds me of Mulholland Drive only much more abstract. The regular film goer probably will not get much out of Paula Paula, but its not a film for everybody. It's very much an acquired taste. I have already watched it twice within the few days I've owned it. I will most certainly be giving it many more viewings.",1327104000,9,652,4.308943089430894
8429092,1,B004GYS2RE,"I've watched over 15 Jess Franco films.  He's hit or miss with me. This one doesn't even qualify as a miss.  Jess has his trademark gratuitous nudity in this one; but for the most part there is no plot or story line here despite the product description.  There is some minor dialog in the beginning and a murder at the end; but about 90% of the film is non-sensical gyrating dancing, a little girl-girl action and lots of second-rate kaleidoscope visual effects supported by a free-form jazz piano musical score (zzzzz).  If you are interested because of the nudity - this isn't worth it and the visual quality is poor - mainly dim lighting.  If you are interested in this because of the story described in the product description and your a Jess Franco fan - you'll be disappointed.  If you're a Friedrich Gulda music fan, maybe you'll find something redeeming; but I doubt it.  Perhaps some film school experts can find some nuggets of value here, but there is virtually nothing for anyone else.  Consider yourself warned.",1297900800,19,1024,4.713483146067416
