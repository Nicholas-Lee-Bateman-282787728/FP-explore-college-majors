1953625,5,B0000VJFX2,I ordered this video because it said it came with a toy scoop. It didn't! It's just a video. This is the first time I've not gotten what I ordered! I still gave a good review because the video is great!,1191024000,,202,3.951219512195122

8003778,1,B0000VJFX2,The reason why I purchased this was for the scoop figure which was not in the product I recieved. i also made the mistake of reading the reviews which said this was a DVD.....it is a VHS. So if you want a VHS with NO scoop this is your product.,1383264000,,244,3.9

8003781,4,B0000VJFX2,"My 3yr old Grandson enjoyed this episode. It was a little different for him because he's more used to an energetic fare like The Imagination Movers or Spiderman. That said, the slower pace did us both good and now its time for some Elmo. Gotta go :-)<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bob-the-Builder-Scoop-s-Favorite-Adventures/dp/B00029NLCI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bob the Builder - Scoop's Favorite Adventures</a>",1326240000,,454,7.125
