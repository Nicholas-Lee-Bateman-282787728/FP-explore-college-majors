2688101,4,B000KCHZI8,"If you like GORE then this movie is for you. If Hostel and Saw made you squirm, this one will make u puke.  In the first 8 minutes there are 6 murders ranging from a blood gushing emasculation (which will make any man watching iit wince in pain. To pouring some sort of liquid acid down the throat so the the entire body melts and pours out.

And thats just the beginning of the fun.  Joe Zaso is Michael an American who has moved to Germany with an annoying friend David played by Andre Reissig (whom I was ready to see him die with the 1st 2 minutes).

Michael is pining away over Nina a love that may or may not be what he really wants.

Nina, played by Raine Brown apparently is up for Bitch of the Year Award,

at least thats what she seemed to be trying to prove. (Wheres an axe when you need one?)

The three friends go off in the woods for an overnight camp out.  This gives Michael and Nina plenty of time to wander around and have heart to hearts which really try way too hard to give us incite to them.

Meanwhile in the woods is a family who is a combination of the Hills Have Eyes clan and Wrong Turn inbred killers some of whom are even dressed like the killers in Hostel. Every few minutes while we are following the angst of Michael and Nina out of nowhere the scene switches to the next gore filled killing just to keep you awake.

The movie have SERIOUS SERIOUS GORE GALORE.  I don't think that I have ever in all the many many horror films I have watched in my lifetime seen so much realistic over the top gore and violence. It's MESSY for sure.

The reveal of the movie to me was kinda silly but it doesn't detract from what this movie is about and thats the gore...

Joe Zaso is the best of the 3 main actors and not to mention the fact that he is gorgeous and has a skinny dipping scene. He is the most realistic and convincing of the characters.

Raine Browns acting is over the top, just seemed that her character way more of a bitch than she should have been. She over acts for the most part.

Andre Reissig was ok but annoying as David.

All in all this is a good little movie, a great one for a group of friends to get together have a few beers and see who can watch it without turning away from the screen or puking.

The DVD Extras are pretty good too just DONT watch them before the movie it will spoil the whole thing.",1168214400,30,2349,4.093886462882096
2688102,4,B000KCHZI8,"If you are looking for gore then, this film is for you, i'm a big horror fan, and i have never seen so much blood and gore in a movie as this. The story is really weak, and the ending is worse, i gave this 4 stars just because of the gore and i bought this movie just for that as well, but if i have to give stars for the story line then i would give it 2 stars. This really could have been a good movie, if there was some good acting and a well crafted story line. But what really is amazing is the gore effects on the movie. If you are into gore and just plain hack and slash entertainment, then buy this movie as it's worth the money you pay for to see the chunks of blood and gore fly across the screen.",1187395200,7,707,3.7837837837837838
2688103,1,B000KCHZI8,The plot was loose at best and the acting is down right horrible. The gore was great but the movie was extremely disappointing. I would not suggest purchasing this movie maybe you can rent it off netflix or something.,1184889600,3,217,4.589743589743589
2688104,2,B000KCHZI8,"This movie could have been much better with little effort. First, there was too much gore. That usually does not add much to this genre. Second the fast forward [...] should have beeen eliminated alltogether. What was the purpose? The fast forward messed up what could and should have been some decent fight scenes. There was  too much action in too dark a scenery. We had no idea what was goin on. Why was so much edited out. One minute David is with Nina and Michael, the next, he is being chased by killers. There was no continueum from one scene to the next. This plagued the entire movie. A critical scene that should have been insrumental to the movie was when the killers took and beat up Michael. Apparently anybody could beat up big, muscular Michael at will. There were also too many victims in the movie, which dilutes the importance of someone like David being killed. The fight scenes should have been normal speed. Why did we not get to see Nina and Michael escape the killers, just like we did not get to see the killers beat and take Michael, when he was snared in the foot.
Why, whenever Nina and Michael were surrounde by the killers, was Michael hiding behind Nina? This made him look pathetic. If he is not going to be useful in the fight scenes ,then at least give us a good reason why, like a good beating when he was taken from the snare, or a good beating in the cabin, before he and Nina escaped. And that ""broken record"" part of the soundtrack(BARF)was terrible. As a matter of fact, much of the soundtrack was terrible.
This is one of a thousand movies inspired by Burt Reynolds' ""Deliverance"".
And this is one of the thousand that should have been better. Normal fight scenes, a little more light in the extremely dark scenes, a better soundtrack, including crucial deleted scenes and 1/2 of the protagonist haveing some guts and a good left hook. I rate this movie a solid -2- because I really don't think anybody will be breaking down any barricades to see this one, but it is worth watching from behind one though.",1184630400,8,2045,4.497311827956989
2688105,4,B000KCHZI8,"Yes, GORE is the name of the game here, but indie auteur Timo Rose also does a nice job of keeping things moving in this stuck-in-the-woods hack'n'slash, punctuated with unexpected flashes of style and humour. Not the best horror film ever made, but it was great that Rose directed his movie with a seemingly even tone and a direction in mind, even if the direction he was heading has been well-travelled in the past -- and the destination, while boasting a lot of panache, is still way far short of taking the genre to the next level. Still, I found it pretty enjoyable as a somewhat jaded horror freak.",1182988800,3,604,4.5504587155963305
2688106,4,B000KCHZI8,"The story was typical for a horror movie.
Friends get together in the woods to have a good time.
- The muscle-bound girly man, who is harboring feelings for
- the rabid, american princess, who positively hates his friend
- the obnoxious pervert.
What they don't know is that the woods are inhabited by inbred cannibals.
Inbred cannibals who have been viciously slaughtering helpless campers for years.
The story might be trite, but the gore is anything but.
Loads of visceral scenes ranging from; a furious castration, to a slow-paced mutilation.
[...]
Aside from the eye-popping gore, the inbred cannibals look amazing. (By anyone's standard)
They're a family, though you won't get to see them all until the end, which is quite a shame, considering how well they look.
Regardless of the run-of-the-mill story,
The scenes drenched in blood, are what ultimately piggyback the whole movie along.
They're unnecessary, and usually involve other campers that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot itself.
But the truth is, without those scenes you would quickly lose interest in the  mundane characters & their uneventful dialogue.
In an attempt to give the story some depth, two totally unwarranted characters are soon added to the fray.
But ultimately this fails because,
one of them is entirely unbelievable,
and the other has no back-story what-so-ever,and just seems to show up out of the middle of nowhere.
But even worse than the story itself, is the ending.
It felt rushed, like the production ran out of time & money.
It almost seemed like the director didn't care anymore, and just wanted to get it over with.
I don't want to ruin it for you, but it doesn't make any sense.
I'm not sure how running around the woods in the rain, turns you from an american princess to ""Clint-freakin'-Eastwood""
Or why her & her girly-man don't get attacked while they're in the cannibal's cabin.
But let me stop before I say too much and ruin a bad ending for you.
In short,
only catch this flick, if you're solely interested in being grossed out,
and could honestly care less about plot.
Because in truth, the story becomes completely irrelevant,
once the blood starts pouring.

MORAL OF THE STORY:
The family that eats human flesh together; stays together.",1181174400,3,2252,4.892670157068062
2688107,2,B000KCHZI8,"What do you get when you take an idea for a movie, put all your talents and budget into the photography and special effects and decide on no character development or storyline? Well you might answer a big budget movie out of Hollywood but in this case you get Barricade. This quirky film with all its problems is still a somewhat watchable horror movie. It is almost two separate movies: intense and bloody Saw inspired scenes, and really bad scenes from any `teens at camp' movie from 25 years ago. Sure it has terrible music and despite Joe Zaso's size and looking like he could lift a car, he comes off as the wimpiest male lead in horror movie history. He even uses Raine Brown as a shield in the cabin scene! There is no plot and the dialogue and back story are incredibly inept. When Brown and Zaso are having one of their many discussions, you really hope the cannibals will tear them apart for being so boring. The characters are amazingly one dimensional and the one gratuitous partial nude scene harks back to the silly sex scenes from an 80's slasher film. Typically Teutonic and devoid of emotion, you never connect with anybody and the brutal torture scenes loose their impact very quickly. Although the violence is well crafted with color drenched photography, it is lacking intensity and becomes monotonous. The final scenes in the woods are downright ridiculous and end up being very funny due to bad acting, editing and loss of directorial focus. The Freak with the partial gas mask can't seem to figure out how to kill Zaso or Brown and just stands there while the camera begins a nauseating ineffectual spin. This could have been a great movie. The gore could have been used with so much more intensity and even with the terrible actors this film could have been saved if more time was put into a better story, more interesting characters and a soundtrack that actually helped the film instead of ruining it. Although Barricade relies heavily on inspiration from The Devil's Rejects, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes, it delivers none of the horror and memorable moments from those films.",1179705600,3,2135,4.726541554959786
2688108,5,B000KCHZI8,"3 friends on a camping trip encounter horror and death.  Sound familiar?  Although the basic story line has been done thousands of times, Barricade is a step above the rest.  The gore is gruesome and realistic.  The terror they feel transmits itself to the viewer, leaving one tense and on the edge of your seat.  The final sceen is awesome, unlike a lot of horror movies that just kind of leave you hanging.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a lot of graphic blood.",1176163200,5,483,4.494252873563219

8155554,2,B000KCHZI8,"I give two and a half stars to this gory, torturous horror film that seems to try too hard to be ""something more,"" and ends up as something less.

Following a familiar plot of German hillbilly cannibals who conveniently show up looking to devour a cast that has not even  ventured very far into the wilderness, Barricade (don't ask me the meaning of the title) features some very gruesome gore and a satisfying fight at the finale, but not much else to recommend it unless you're a confirmed fan of its makers.

The acting, because it tries too hard, is all wrong for the film's setting. The direction, by trying to be fancy and ""creative"" for no good reason, goes nowhere. And the pacing is atrocious, with long chat sessions inadequately mixed with gore scenes.

Even worse is when director Rose's camera goes running, jumping and flying all over the place for no apparent reason. I appreciate filmmakers trying to do new things when they know what they're doing, but I did not see much evidence of that with this film's nutty cinematography.

The music here is also atrocious. At one point, some guy is moaning about love in a voice that makes it sound as if HE'S being tortured to death! Maybe it's trying to be arty or ironic, it's hard to tell. But it did not work with this viewer, that's for sure.

Still, there is enough interest in the main characters to support them, and there is an appropriately to-the-point finale. The film mostly avoids boring chase scenes. And while there may be some unfortunate CGI, most of the gore appears blessedly real and appropriately stomach-turning.

All in all, this is worth a watch for horror, gore and Timo Rose fans. All others definitely need not bother at all.",1480636800,,1711,4.645695364238411
8155555,1,B000KCHZI8,"""Barricade' is a vile, disgusting movie from Germany that plays more like a third reich training manual than anything else. A kind of teutonic ""Wrong Turn"" with a pack of cannibals and freaks loose in the Black Forest, hacking and butchering everyone in their sights.  Quite frankly I lost track of a story because every few minutes someone was getting disemboweled but to the movies credit, it was meant to be gross and it never strays from that premise.  It's gross and I feel proud I made it through the entire sickening thing without heaving. The body count is pretty high even for one of these movies and I kind of felt bad for the guy who was taking a leak in the bushes and lost his favorite body part to a machete.

The movie does have one kill scene I have never seen before.  The camera p.o.v. was from inside one victims stomach as a pair of bloody hands were dipping in removing organs.

The movie argueably may not be the bloodiest, goriest movie ever, but it is surely one of the more disgusting ones. One of the cannibals dresses like he stepped out of the ""Hostel"" movies but ""Hostel"" is a Sunday school sermon compared to ""Barricade.""

One last note:  when things go from bad to worse and even worser(?-that's not even a word-shame on me) the ""hero"" who is about 6'5"" hides behind his 5 foot tall girlfriend.

You have been warned...avoid ""Barricade""--even the title makes no sense.",1247443200,,1399,4.5458167330677295

Whereas the former usually has some kind of comment to make about society in general, the latter inevitably turns inward and holds a looking glass up to human nature itself when it is reduced to its more primordial level.  No such luck in this this little outing set in the Black Forest of Germany.  If you like over the top gore (which I do), then you will love this film.  The special effects are eye-popping in some parts--it must be owned there is one awesome scene shot from the point of view of being inside the cadaver and looking up the spine as the body is being pulled apart.  But good gore cannot alone a good horror movie make, and alas, the way the gore is woven into the story . . . .well, it isn`t.  It is like watching a little kid do something gross and then smirk for his attention.  Where as it was once said that the gory special effects were the story in some of Fulci's finer films, it cannot be so in Barricade, because behind Fulci's effects were some half-way competent actors to give substance to the carnage as it unfolded before and around them.  In Barricade, the insubstantial characters do nothing but make one non-sequitor decision after another:  who takes plastic lawn chairs and tables on a camping trip??--and since when is a car battery dead when you can still turn the car over, if not start it---even I know that much about cars!  The violence in Barricade, rather than logically sequencing some act of stupidity on one of the characters' parts, is almost Monty Pythonesque for its extremeness and for coming from nowhere out of the blue.  As for the main leads, if you are going to cast a scream queen such as Raine Brown, and then not have her scream or get undressed, there's not much left she is good for---and don't say acting!  The video game style first person shooter will either appeal to the view or leave them languishing for the good old days of Blair Witch Project movies that still pioneered this approach.  And if extreme close ups of people's faces while they are scared out of their wits or are getting mutilated aren't enough for you, there are always the sporadic and random pig squeals to signal a scene transition.",1240704000,,2394,4.809756097560975
8155557,1,B000KCHZI8,"Barricade (Timo Rose, 2007)

Timo Rose, whose Mutation series has been clogging up DVD players for the past decade, gets his first major release in Barricade, and, well, if you were hoping his movies had gotten any better, well, put that hope aside. Barricade is derivative, amateurish, and silly, just as you'd expect it to be if you're familiar with Rose's movies.

Plot: young-and-beautifuls vs. killer cannibals in the woods. The main young-and-beautifuls are played by Raine Brown (Dante Tomaselli's Horror) and Joe Zaso (Nikos the Impaler); the leader of the cannibals is played by Manoush (Amelie). Not an awful cast, to be sure, but Rose manages to bring out the worst in each of his actors. I was going to say ""...but it's not all Rose's fault"" and then go on to excoriate the crew of the movie, but as I scroll down through the IMDB page, it looks as if it is all Rose's fault. The cinematography? Rose, in collaboration with Mathias Jakubski. The editing? Rose? The special effects? Rose, in collaboration with Olaf Ittenbach. Writer and producer? You guessed it. Rose has almost complete creative control over the movie. Yeah, so does Woody Allen. I don't like his movies, either. *",1238371200,,1194,4.848039215686274
8155558,5,B000KCHZI8,"I bought BARRICADE, an indie horror film written and directed by Timo Rose, featuring Joe Zaso and Raine Brown.  It was co-written by Ted Geoghegan (writer of Sweat Shop) who is one of the most talented writers in indie horror today.

I have watched it twice in the past week.

The story is one, set in the Black Forest mountains of Germany, of an incestuous and cannibalistic family that kill pretty much all who come to the Black Forest to camp and enjoy some of the most beautiful forest in the world.

The film rocks. It's the most violent and gory film of it's genre that I've seen. There is NOTHING about the film I did not like.

Raine and Joe are fantastic. I absolutely love Raine Brown and believe her to be in the top 5 most talented actresses in indie horror today.  The family is scary as hell. The gore f/x are nasty and quite extreme.

The cinematography, directing, and editing are all tight as hell. Mr. Rose is involved in every aspect of the film.  He co-writes, directs, edits, co-cinematography,  and plays Marc, one of the family.  He is a force to be reckoned with in the indie horror world and I'm truly looking forward to his upcoming spin on the werewolf genre, THE BEAST.

Barricade makes the remake of  THE HILLS HAVE EYES look like it was made by Walt Disney.  Given a choice of THE HILLS HAVE EYES, WRONG TURN, or BARRICADE, choose BARRICADE.  You won't be disappointed in the least.",1225497600,2,1413,4.46875
8155559,2,B000KCHZI8,"Obviously a low-budget production, Barricade has little going for it, except for the gore, which is exceptional.

There's no story to speak of. A family of inbred mutant cannibals live out in the woods (which looks suspiciously like a park), where they attack, torture, dismember, and eat people they come across. Our protagonists are attacked, the most annoying one is killed, they fight back, kill the mutants, the end. Yep, that's it. Lighting and photography are sub-standard. The editing varies from adequate to terrible. The acting barely reaches amateur level.

However, it has gore and plenty of it. If you're into the ""torture porn"" sub-genre of horror (Hostel, etc), then this is for you. People are killed in various sadistic ways, stabbed, cut, dismembered, intestines are pulled out of stomachs and then consumed, there's even nipple mutilation in the unrated version. The mutant killers are also exteremly busy in this film and knock off an alarming number of victims during a very short period of time. The quality of the gore fx is very high and it's likely that most of the money went into this.
