7953141,2,B00005S6KI,"It is almost a sin to use the same title (Untold Story) when referring to this disappointing sequel.  The original was bone-chilling...priceless...broke new ground in gore and horror.  This one is almost a comedy.  The characters are unconvincing...some of the cast should quit their acting career tomorrow (if they haven't already)...and the soundtrack is childish and completely out of synch with the screenplay.  The goriest scene is when the wife is butchered in the bathtub by what appears to be an oversized electric meat carver.  What makes it even more silly, is that it is an electric (cord and all) carver, being used to slice and dice underwater (????).  The best part of this film is that its title hits home on two very important regards...it should go untold and ""unseen"".",1109116800,3,786,4.961832061068702
7953142,3,B00005S6KI,"The first ""Untold Story"" is probably my favorite category 3 movie that I have seen.  Despite its depravity, it has a sense of fun to it.  This is just a so-so slasher flick.  It did not keep my attention.
I bought it because it was cheap and because I liked the first one.  Do not make the same mistake I did.",1084665600,5,309,4.016393442622951
