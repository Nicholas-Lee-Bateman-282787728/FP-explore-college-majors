3169488,5,B0017ANAZO,"The star power alone is reason enough to view this film, a remake of the 1939 original. Do yourself a favor and don't view this film or completely base your choice on whether or not to view it or buy it on reviews comparing it to the original. I viewed The Women, written and directed by Diane English, without any expectations. In this 21st century version, a group of four women, each a well-defined individual (although perhaps a bit stereotypical) reacts to and faces the topic of betrayal.

Meg Ryan, Mary, is a Connecticut housewife and philanthropist, raising a child with the help of a live-in nanny and a housekeeper (Cloris Leachman). Mary learns her high-profile husband is having an affair with the gorgeous ""spritzer girl,"" played by the VERY hot Eva Mendes. She works at the Saks' perfume counter. Mary's friend, Sylvia (played by Annette Bening) is a between-relationships/childless/magazine editor. She actually learns of the infidelity first and shares the news with their other two friends. Jada Pinkett Smith is Alex, an author/lesbian and Debra Messing plays the fertile-mertyl of the group, Edie, who is pregnant . . . again. Along with Mary's mother, played by Candice Bergen, the friends do their best to try and get Mary through this difficult time. It's by no means a smooth ride and the friendship between Sylvia and Mary is particularly tested. I thought the substance of friendship dynamics rang very true.

Definitely a chick-flick, but an intelligent one especially suited for middle-aged women. I don't think a single man makes an appearance in the film. Watch it with your girlfriends, sisters, mothers, aunts and / or daughters.

3169489,2,B0017ANAZO,"Director/screenwriter Diane English's 2008 update of George Cukor's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1939-MGM-classic-comedy/dp/B0008ENICU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1939 MGM classic comedy</a>&nbsp;unfortunately shows more mothballs than its predecessor. Based on Clare Booth Luce's shrewdly observant 1936 play on the relationships that evolve among a strictly female group of pampered Manhattan socialites, the story would seem ripe for a contemporary remake. Instead, because of English's thematic overreach, the production comes across as an extended therapy session with a paucity of wit. What's more, the diverse lifestyles of women today have been reduced to sitcom-level stereotypes in this movie, and the original play's central conceit of eliminating men from the storyline seems even more contrived given the openly pansexual evolution that has occurred among men as well as women since the 1930's. To add insult to injury, the recent big screen adaptation of HBO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-and-the-City/dp/B001DDBCUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex and the City</a>&nbsp;did this sort of sorority-style dishing much better and with far sharper fangs.

The skeleton of the original play remains as the story centers on wealthy Mary Haines, who gave up her promising clothing design career to become the devoted wife of a Wall Street financial wizard. Like ""Sex and the City"", she is surrounded by three best friends - Sylvie Fowler, a successful, cutthroat magazine editor in the mold of Miranda Priestly in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-Wears-Prada/dp/B000J103PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil Wears Prada</a>&nbsp;(yet another film this echoes); perennially pregnant Edie Cohen representing the stay-at-home wife; and Alex Fisher, a lesbian author who seems to represent every repressed group generally excluded from such an exclusive clique. Through a mouthy manicurist, they find out Mary's husband is having an affair with man-eater Crystal Allen, a perfume girl at Saks more than willing to break up a marriage as she struggles to become an actress. The rest of the plot doesn't matter much since it becomes a series of scenes focused on sisterly bonding and bickering, none of it very illuminating and without the satirical zing that buoyed the 1939 movie.

Looking strangely youthful at 47, Meg Ryan seems to play Mary in a manner that tries to resuscitate the goodwill she engendered in the 1990's with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-Harry-Met-Sally/dp/B000XJD33O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When Harry Met Sally...</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepless-in-Seattle/dp/B0000AOV4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepless in Seattle</a>. It's not that she isn't age-appropriate here, but her familiar sprightliness seems at odds with the character's passive nature. Annette Bening fares somewhat better in the scene-stealing Rosalind Russell role of Sylvie because she has proven to be adept at conveying hardness while masking vulnerability, but her character goes through such a trite transformation that it undermines the actress' performance severely. Poor Eva Mendes has to play Crystal as a shallow, transparent shopgirl versus the smart, hard-edged cookie Joan Crawford got to play. Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith are scooted way to the sidelines as Edie and Alex, respectively. Much better are Candice Bergen as Mary's savvy, supportive mother and Cloris Leachman as the non-nonsense housekeeper.

Probably reflecting the lackluster box office response to the film's release, the 2008 DVD doesn't have a robust set of extras. There are two deleted scenes - one with Crystal and her friends having a girls' night-in as a contrast to Mary's elaborate garden party, and the other an extension of Bette Midler's cameo as a multi-married Hollywood agent counseling Mary during a late night at a yoga camp. Two featurettes round out the extras - ""The Women: The Legacy"" about the history behind the film from the original 1936 play, and ""The Women Behind the Women"" which has cast and crew speak endlessly about female self-empowerment and self-image. The irony is that this version of ""The Women"" directed and scripted by a woman takes such a patronizing look at women.",1229904000,4,4457,6.315270935960591
3169490,1,B0017ANAZO,"I actually rented this movie with an open mind, I've watched the orignal many times and thought that it was ahead of it's time.  I was right, this remake is pretty awful! Even though it steals so many of the witty lines from the original, which was released in 1939, this movie is so boring and badly acted that I barely could keep myself focused on watching it.  Do yourself a big favor, and rent the original and place this one in the ""Forget"" pile!!!!",1229817600,9,454,4.329411764705882
3169491,4,B0017ANAZO,"I didn't think I'd like this movie, but I did. The Women, starring Meg Ryan, Annette Bening, Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett was a very nice surprise, in large part due to a stellar performance by Annette Bening and a couple of great cameos by Candace Bergen, Carrie Fisher, and Debi Mazar. Eva Mendez was perfect for her role, as was Debra Messing, and if I hadn't gotten distracted by Meg Ryan's overblown hair and lips, I'd give it a solid five stars. :-) As it is, I give it four stars and a solid thumbs up.

A woman's three best friends find out that her husband is being unfaithful - do they tell her? Sure they do, but not before seeing for themselves that the poor schmuck never stood a chance against a hot tamale like Eva, the perfume girl at Saks. Guided by her mother's advice, Meg decides to let her husband have his little fling, knowing he'll get tired of his spicy and demanding chica pretty quickly. He does, and she thinks she's won, until she finds out the affair is still going on. This is a great story about the power of girlfriends, the power of women, and the power of forgiveness.

Wronged wife Meg Ryan copes with the breakup of her marriage with advice from her friends and her mother, and in the process is transformed from a messy haired mess, submerged in nameless Mom-dom, into what she always wanted to be all along. a chic, gorgeous fashion designer who wows the world with her first collection. (This is the only part of the script that bothered me. It was a bit much, just like Meg's hair and lips.) Anyway, this transformation doesn't happen overnight, and along the way, Annette Bening's character absolutely shines as the best friend, who, in a moment of career panic, agrees to publish the messy details of her best friend's divorce. The schmuck is a muckety-muck on Wall Street, you see, and well... sex sells.

The breakup between the best friends is even worse than the breakup of Meg's marriage. It's no coincidence that the name of this movie is ""The Women"", because that's what the movie is all about - relationships between women (the breakup of Meg's marriage is basically a side plot). Annette begs for forgiveness, but Meg cuts her off, just like she has her husband. Annette continues to be a friend behind Meg's back by helping her adolescent daughter cope with her parent's impending divorce. They eventually (of course) get back to being best friends in a great scene where they fight, hug, fight some more, and then do some more hugging. Just like real women. :-)

Meanwhile, the poor schmuck of a husband is always in the wings (though we never meet him). Once he knew he was busted, he broke things off with Eva, and seems truly contrite. He's pining for his wife back, begging for a second chance to get to know the ""new"" Meg.

Ultimately, just like she gave her friend Annette Bening a second chance at friendship, Meg gives her husband a second chance in their marriage. They're two different people now and we, as viewers, are supposed to believe that this couple is going to live happily ever after, despite his infidelity. Meg is no longer the mousy little mom who was willing to put up with an affair, and her husband has learned that the grass isn't always greener on the other side of the fence.

I'd say that the lesson of this movie was that we have to love ourselves before other people can love us. That if we love people, we forgive them, even if they've hurt us badly. Definitely a great chick flick movie (I enjoyed it much more than I did the last Sex In The City), and (shhh....don't tell anybody) but my husband actually enjoyed it, too.",1229817600,5,3612,4.523736600306279
3169492,2,B0017ANAZO,"I had high expectations. The cast is brilliant - the director as well. Yet these characters just seemed undeveloped - there wasn't enough going on to tie them closely enough. It was mainly a set of acquaintances thrown together. And maybe just 1 man would've helped keep this movie interesting. I think Diane English had a gazillion-dollar opportunity - but it seemed to fall flat.  Predictable - boring - and too much posing. Ok Meg, we get ""the hair.""

I wished to see more struggle - then maybe I could've bought the ending. Too bad.",1229126400,3,536,4.631578947368421

3169496,1,B0017ANAZO,"The Women (2008) by Diane English is sadly such a waste of talent. With Annette Benning, Candice Bergen, Bette Midler, Cloris Leachman whom I like and enjoy in everything I've seen them, and Meg Ryan, Jada Pinkett Smith, Debra Messing, and Eva Mendes who may not be my favorite actors but are nice to look at, how could the movie be boring, predictable, embarrassing, sloppy, and simply bad? It was made by Diane English who is known as the writer of the very successful TV show Murphy Brown, and it is her first movie for which she wrote a script. The movie has been a labor of love for English who had tried for many years to make it happen and I respect that. I even found the scenes with the supporting players, Bergen, Leechaman, Carry Fisher and Bette Middler in short but memorable cameos, funny, smart, and enjoyable but in general the movie is a second hand ""Sex and the City"" which was released few months ago. I did not find Sex and the City very good when I saw it but next to The Women, it was simply brilliant. At least, Sex and the City spared us the long and tasteless scene in the hospital's delivery room where one of the characters' was having a baby and her friends were there supporting her. Poor Debra Messing, what did she do to deserve that nightmare she was put through and we, the viewers together with her? The movies like ""The Women"" give the whole genre, chick flicks, a bad name. It is nothing wrong with the genre, but why is it so difficult to make a really good comedy about female friendships and hardships, about dealing with marriage, motherhood, and proving yourself professionally? These are all very compelling and important subjects any modern woman can relate to. Why making movies with the lines, dialogs, and situations so clichd, predictable, not funny and insulting that they will be forgotten as soon as the movie is over?

After I saw the new movie, I checked out from my local library the original The Women and I truly enjoyed it. The story was told much better 70 years ago, and kept my interest all the way. The old movie had a real star power.

1.5/5",1222300800,9,2102,4.485639686684073
3169497,4,B0017ANAZO,"""The Women"" is the film ""Sex and the City"" wishes it was. There are some distinct similarities: both are about a group of female friends living in New York; both feature quirky main characters; both tackle relationship and fidelity issues; both look at life through a very witty filter (mostly to a fault). But ""The Women"" is the superior film, and that's only partly because of its much more tolerable sense of humor; the characters in this film are examined maturely, allowing us to see them as more than shallow, artificial caricatures. I actually felt something for these women. I cared about them and wondered what would happen to them. While not faithful to either George Cukor's 1939 film or the original play by Clare Boothe Luce, this new film is a delight from beginning to end, and it plays true to its title by not featuring a single male character.

The plot mainly focuses on fashion designer Mary Haines (Meg Ryan), who, in addition to being fired by her own father, discovers that her well-known husband, Stephen, is having an affair with Crystal Allen (Eva Mendes), a perfume saleswoman from Saks Fifth Avenue. Standing by Mary is her best friend, magazine editor Sylvia Fowler (Annette Benning), who had already heard about the affair through a gossipy manicurist (Debi Mazar). Sylvia, as it turns out, is having problems of her own; her magazine isn't selling as well as it used to, meaning she's inches away from being fired. Desperate to keep her career alive, she sells Mary's high-profile story to a tabloid writer (a cameo by Carrie Fisher), which, as you might expect, threatens to destroy their friendship. She's no longer sure she can trust anyone, and this includes her other two friends, writer Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett Smith), and the ever-pregnant Edie Cohen (Debra Messing).

Would this story be better or worse if male characters were included? Chances are it would be worse, simply because male/female relationship stories are a dime a dozen. What makes ""The Women"" unique is that it forces the main character to analyze her situation from an entirely feminine perspective. A man--be it her husband, a friend, a brother, or even a stranger--is not there to influence her one way or another. Think about all the recent romantic comedies in which the male leads inevitably profess their undying love for the female co-stars: every scene like that is always so contrived, so out of touch with anything realistic or even plausible. No such scene exists in ""The Women."" Through the support of her friends, the wisdom of her mother (Candice Bergen), the loyalty of her housekeeper (Cloris Leachman), and an awful lot of soul searching, Mary has to determine on her own whether or not she wants to take her husband back. The question is: Does he want to be taken back? Is he still in love with her, or has he moved on?

An interesting subplot focuses on the relationship between Mary and her eleven-year-old daughter, Molly (India Ennenga), who often feels unheard and misunderstood. She doesn't appreciate her mother's meaningless assertions that everything will be all right. Clearly, it won't be. She misses the love her parents shared, a love that always put an extra bounce in her mother's step. And like many young girls growing up in Western society, she believes she fat (even though she's anything but). Mary, consumed with her own problems, fails to notice the warning signs her daughter is giving off. So imagine her surprise when she learns that Molly is turning to Sylvia for advice--Sylvia, a childless woman who threw her best friend to the wolves. The confrontation between her and Mary is an interesting scene, not only because it's heartfelt and humorous at the same time, but also because of the way it's constructed; they defend themselves at the start, but by the end, one knows exactly where the other is coming from. If only all disagreements could end that way.

On a women's retreat, Mary meets an agent named Leah Miller (another cameo by Better Midler). As they share a joint in their cabin, Leah reveals her secret to living life: Be selfish. Don't care about what others want. The sooner you ask, ""What do I want?"" the sooner you'll be content. I can't say whether or not Mary takes this idea to heart, given how she really feels about her husband. What I can say is that the women of ""Sex and the City"" followed it to a tee. Rarely have I seen characters so shallow, so annoying, so lacking in redeeming qualities.

Thank goodness ""The Women"" goes in a much different direction. The pleasure of watching this movie comes from knowing that writer/director Diane English added depth to the characters. Granted, some were given more attention than others; Jada Pinkett Smith and Debra Messing weren't given much screen time, which is disappointing considering the narrative potential of their characters. This is especially true of Messing's character, the eccentric Edie, who announces early on that she'll keep getting pregnant until she has a boy (she already has three daughters). Wouldn't it be fun if she were the best friend instead of Sylvia? Or what about Smith's character, Alex, made openly gay for this modernized version? Both characters come dangerously close to being extraneous. Maybe it would have been better if the story focused on two friends instead of four. Be that as it may, ""The Women"" is a charming, well-acted, well-plotted film--about the most fun you'll have in a male-free environment.",1221264000,38,5470,4.8964401294498385

3169516,3,B0017ANAZO,"I recently watched the 1939 version with Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell and Joan Fontaine. I was slightly dragged into it by an aunt and about five minutes into the movie, decided I really loved it. For 1939 it was forward thinking and quite funny. While some reviewers may not have liked Jada Pinkett-Smith (in particular her lesbian character), I personally enjoyed her character, and yes I am.... and yes, I've met many who are a lot like this character.
 I think the point of all these characters is a reminder that not all women are cookie cutter stereotypes of any class of women, we are all unique.
As for this 2008 version of a sleepy classic; had I not seen the original I most likely still would have given it three stars. There were definitely awkward moments that felt forced by the actresses. The butter, cocoa and milk scene automatically lost them a star. That was just disgusting.  I also missed several things from the original that I would have liked to have seen then either expand upon or tackle for this century. For example, the divorce dude ranch from the original with the Countess. I loved that role from the 1939 version and I love Bette Midler for this role, it makes sense, but she had a smaller part than Mary Bowland did in the original. That character was great.
I also liked that Crystal Allen was seeing someone else in the original after she had stolen Mary Haine's husband away and eventually found he had no money at all since it belonged to the Countess. Joan Crawford's character got exactly what she deserved in 1939, but Eva Mendes' version really didn't seem to.  And while she is very lovely to look at, well Crawford's Allen character was far nastier, vile and despicable and much better acted.
So overall, three stars mostly for love of the original and the ladies who star in it.  As someone said earlier, it really is a good lazy day or rainy day kind of movie and WILL provide you with a few hearty laughs.",1503619200,,1969,4.569405099150142

Other than the male baby at the end, this film was comprised entirely of women actors.  What a feat!  No film in recent history has ever done that.  (I'm not sure if that was done in the 1930's version of this film.)  In fact, I hadn't even noticed the all female characters until I read that in a summary of the movie.

The 1930s film was interesting so I figured with this cast it should be good, but its not. Seems like an ""I hate men"" a lot through-out as well as ,""my friends are more important than my husband"".
Plus the acting was pretty slow which I assume is due to director.
Its a shame because this and real potential .
Oh and the woman who is suppose to be the hero of the story, gets her money to file her ambition from mommy. So rich married woman who has worked for daddy most of her life, decides to become a fashion designer and mommy pays for it...Basically a woman can't do it truly on her own.
This movie would be good if you were drunk or a teenager who has no idea of real life, or at least the mentality of either. I can't imagine any real woman over the age of 30 enjoying this sad crap of a film.",1482278400,4,888,3.9608938547486034

3169566,2,B0017ANAZO,"Notably, the entire cast is women with not a male to be seen even in passing.  During the initial third of the movie it is rather hard to follow characters and identify relationships.  The plot is finally drawn together by Meg Ryan's marital problems and her best friend's misfortunes as well. The underlying thesis of staying in an adulterous marriage as discussed by Meg and several other characters seems flawed and unrealistic, especially for Meg who confesses to ""cheating once"". . . . moving her top hat figure more than the rolled number of spaces during a childhood Monopoly game!

Meg Ryan plays the role perfectly plus never for one moment does she act like a victim. She is a strong, smart person who does not allow anyone, friend or family to be a negative influence on her chosen path. Not surprisingly, Meg's character prevails and in the end she has everything she needs or wants including her group of friends which accounts for most of the rest of the cast.

Another reason I enjoyed the movie was because watching an ensemble of stellar stars perform on the same stage is fascinating. Relax, watch this movie and enjoy seeing ""The Women"" give it their best shot.",1445472000,,697,4.488188976377953

3169736,3,B0017ANAZO,"The Women was a stellar film in the 1930s with a solid cast featuring Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, and Joan Fontaine among a gaggle of other beauties and stars of their time. The script was comedic genius and the acting aces. Unfortunately the remake was a huge letdown with poor pacing and too many moments when the actors appeared uncomfortable in their own skin. Eva Mendes filled Joan Crawford's shoes and while her sexual allure is indisputable she did not have the sophistication and elegance that Joan Crawford brought to the role and her scenes were cut short in comparison. Meg Ryan seemed an odd casting choice especially since this was post-botax and Debra Messing seemed to be trying too hard. The Dennie Moore scene from the 1930s film is well created by Debi Mazar. I should have known the film would be a loser the moment Meg Ryan's character chooses not to accept the Jungle Red nail polish. In this day and age it seemed as if the feminist progressive views from 1939 were being doused with water and that is not a good way to start a movie. Enjoy the fun cameos and the cute opening scene with Annette Bening but don't throw away your copy of the 1930s classic.",1423872000,9,1180,4.570754716981132

I can honestly say the acting of this movie was on the low quality side.  it did not elicit any emotion from me. Usually any movie I watch elicits some kind of emotions, but I didn't feel anything and I wanted to turn off the movie in the first 10 minutes, but decided to give it a try anyway and ended up wasting my time and my money.  Also I didn't get the message, was it forgive your husband for cheating because it isn't his fault that you are a boring middle aged woman without an interesting career. Really? I didn't get it.

3169792,5,B0017ANAZO,"Ths is SUCH a good, funny movie with wonderfully funny actresses, from Meg Ryan to India Ennenga, who plays her daughter. It's a sad, unfair situation too many women have had to deal with. Rich or poor, wives being left for another woman, it's difficult and devastating. This group of ladies display the good intentions and human weaknesses in trying to support Ryan's character. Cloris Leachman is always hilariously stone-faced, teaching Tilly Scott Pedersen the pitfalls of getting emotionally involved w/your employer's issues. Eva Mendes is perfect as the all too confident other woman who finds her 'game on' position can be upended before she can do anything. This was truly a sad situation story played out with funny reality-based elements only women can provide. It's just a wonderfully entertaining film for us ladies. Get out the popcorn and enjoy.",1415059200,,860,5.15
3169793,4,B0017ANAZO,"It's nice to see a film that tells a woman's story that doesn't drop into caricatures and extremes. It almost happens, and I thought it was going to happen a couple of times, but the director did a fine job of ""keeping' it real"" and not making the whole thing laughable.

Each of the actresses was well-chosen for her part:
* I'm not a fan of Meg Ryan, but she did well here. (I really wanted to see her get a couple of barrettes for her hair, so she would get it out of her face.)
* Jada P-Smith did an excellent job. She wasn't insecure in the role, and so played a great second-level character that fit so well into the story. I really liked her in the delivery room.
* Annette Bening brought just the right level of haughtiness to her well-played character without overplaying her.
*Debra Messing was very not-Grace and handled the chaos of motherhood with grace. I'm not a fan of delivery-room screaming and yelling, but it added to the story.
* Eva Mendez played the hussie role very well and with a level of calculation that gave her depth - somewhat skewed in her sense of morals, but not to the extreme.

*SPOILER ALERT*
The only contradiction in the story - maybe even hypocrisy - was that the pregnant character of Debra Messing's had several girls (4? 5? 3?) but she was going to continue to pop them out until she had a boy. After the whole film told the story of the women's strength, their independence, their bond as friends being different than men's friendships - only having a boy-child was the ultimate achievement. Disappointing.",1414368000,,1550,4.49290780141844

Every retelling of a story should be better than the first, but this one was lacked a certain magic. And speaking of magic, they could have done a better job casting the women. On they're own Meg Ryan, Annette Bening and Debra Messing are fantastic. Together they lacked chemistry, and a lot of the acting felt forced.

3169840,1,B0017ANAZO,"Need it be said, I hated this movie. I hated everything about it. If you've read through all the other bad reviews to find this one, than you already know about the mediocre performances, the bad performances, the truly painful performances, and Meg Ryan's self-mutilations--uh, I mean--her latest cosmetic surgery. You also know about the horrible script and boring, nonsensical dialogue. And you probably know that this is a remake of a famous classic from 1939. What hasn't been discussed is WHY this movie went so terribly wrong.
The answer in my opinion rests squarely with Diane English, the butcher of this script. The original film, based on a play of the same name, was about a group of New York's ultra-rich, spoiled, self-obsessed, bitchy socialites getting embroiled in a no-holds-barred cat-fight over a man. It's a fun, sophisticated (for it's time) and hilarious film that still somehow  manages to be sympathetic to its characters. Cue Diane English, who had the brilliant (not!) idea of taking this script and turning into a warm and fuzzy tale of female empowerment-ala-Sex and the City. Presto! The bitchy socialites become successful modern career women (well, some of them anyway) who stick together and support each other when one of their clique is wronged by her husband and the ""other"" woman. And it might have worked, but English either lacked the skill or the confidence to depart from the original script and instead tried to marry it to her modern vision. The result is this infamous train wreck of a film in which everybody looks bad, and sound worse. Nobody is convincing in their roles, or even seems to understand their roles, and whatever 'message' English was trying to send gets buried in the confusion.",1398816000,4,1739,4.975945017182131

3169869,2,B0017ANAZO,Meg Ryan and Annett and Bening had ZERO chemistry.  It was hard to get into the film because of this.  I think Meg Ryan was miscast and the scenes where they are trying to connect fell flat.  Julianne Moore would have been much better.  When it was the four of them together it was fun...the ending was the best part of the movie.  Disappointing that Jada Pinkett Smith's talent was wasted too.,1385424000,,394,4.416666666666667

I saw the 1939 and 2008 movies almost back-to-back and was entertained by both.  I highly urge folks to get this and watch it.  It is the only movie I have ever seen that stars only women--they all deserved academy awards for this!",1379203200,,512,4.440860215053763
3169875,5,B0017ANAZO,"This is not a chick flick, it is a feminist movie (which makes it even better). There were so many facets relating to sexism & women's expected roles that were handled with a few succinct lines of dialogue (these few were the first to be remembered).
""This is my face, deal with it.""

""Since when are you counting calories?""
- ""Since I'm fat."" said by the stick thin 11 year old character

""Why don't they show normal women in magazines?""

""I'm a person, not an accessory.""

""Well, what does she have to be angry about?""
- ""She's hungry."" about a super model who is later seen eating a napkin.

""There are no 60 year old women, I'm the last one.""

""It's time to stop talking down to our readers."" about the direction a women's magazine should take.

Filled with these enlightening bon mots, this movie attempts to scale the anti feminist mountain of propaganda. Woman are not cardboard cut outs with black & white answers, we are complex & messy & capable of growing as this fabulous movie so aptly represents.",1377907200,,1010,4.54696132596685

However, I enjoyed it because it dealt with issues that I actually might think about: divorce, losing a dream job, ups and downs with my women friends. What a relief to see a movie that wasn't obsessed with getting the dream guy and living happily ever after. If you are into those issues, you'll like this movie. It's funny, it slaps on the happy ending, but it's also covers topics that are real and isn't focused only on The Man (although a husband having an affair is certainly a central theme). The cast is amazing and I loved the interactions between the women. Enjoy!

I should add, that despite all those topics, it is certainly a comedy.",1369872000,,800,4.333333333333333

3169911,2,B0017ANAZO,"Meg Ryan plays a wealthy New Yorker whose world is upended when her husband has an affair with a girl who works at a perfume counter (played by Eva Mendes).  How Meg's character and her character's friends learn of her husband's infidelity, and how they help their friend face this problem is fairly entertaining.  Unfortunately for the movie goer, however, Ryan is soon able to realize that she only needs to change the focus of her life from pleasing others to pleasing herself--whereupon she instantly achieves meteoric professional and personal success!  The moral would seem to be that all good things come effortlessly to those who are both rich and lucky!

I should also observe that an interesting aspect of this movie is that no man is ever seen onscreen--nor is his voice even heard over the phone!  This device, although somewhat novel, probably limits the dramatic possibilities--as well as limiting the development of the principal male character: the husband of Meg Ryan's character!",1364601600,,997,5.054878048780488

3169916,4,B0017ANAZO,"I was stuck in a hotel in bad weather and this came on the television.  I thought it was fun.  I had no idea it is a remake of a movie from the 1930s.  I don't even have television at home, so watching in a hotel room in England was just passing the time.  This movie kept my interest.  I thought the cast was delightful and the underlying story of friendship was a good one.
I am always fascinated by movie/TV characters who seem to not have one iota of financial distress, but lots of personal unhappiness
It was not until the next day that I realized that there was not one man to be seen in the entire movie!! All of the crowd scenes were women only; even Mary's dog  was a female, and all of the children girls. Except that baby at the end... one can only guess!
This is not deep or a masterpiece, but a good comedy, though there is nothing funny about infidelity.
I liked it and recommend it",1359504000,5,897,4.126436781609195
3169917,3,B0017ANAZO,"This is a ""chick flik"" in every sense of the word.

Ladies, don't expect your boyfriend to sit through this. He won't.

Actually, I'm glad I didn't review this on a prior occasion. I would have panned it, which would have been unfair. After seeing it a second time, I realize that it's a better movie than I remember. Diane English has tried to make Clare Booth Luce's mid-1930's Broadway Play relevant to the 21st Century and that is just an impossible task.

Ms. Luce wrote the play during a period when her husband was positioned in New York City. She was writing about the spoiled, self-centered, catty, gossipy society dames she had come to know and, of whom, she obviuously disapproved. This type of woman no longer exists unless you count people like Paris Hilton and Tinsley Mortimer and, who cares about them anyway? In the 1930's, this type of women were celebrities with reputations to uphold.

Here's what's missing:

Sidney's (Elizabeth Arden's)
The Train to Reno. (We fly now).
Miriam Aarons. (absorbed into Crystal Allen who has become a Soap Opera  Actress).
The Dude Ranch (Replaced by a Health Spa).
Lucy (absorbed into Cloris Leachman's maid).
Buck Winston.
Peggy (the naive newlywed).
The Starlight Room.
The re-union with Steven.

These women all work. They all like one another. The cat fight has now been reduced to an argument on a street corner.

Sylvia Fowler is now a nice woman played by Annette Bening who is too old for the part.

Meg Ryan is gorgeous, but, you knew that.

Eva Mendes is spectacular looking! What man wouldn't run after her?

Candace Bergen recycles Murphy Brown.

Cloris Leachman is good as always but she has nothing funny to say.

Debra Messing is funny and plays not too bright but she's not as stupid or as mean as Phyllis Povah was in the original movie.

Bette Midler, who would have been fabulous as the Countess has now become a predatory talent agent.

Where is the sniping, gossip, mud-slinging, back biting and hair-pulling?

This story is now PC and heartwarming. If that's what you want, here it is.

Her mother asks her what brought about these changes.  Mary replies, ""Hitting bottom.  Having nothing else to lose.  I highly recommend it.""

3169965,1,B0017ANAZO,"**REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**

Mary Haine (Meg Ryan) finds out her husband is cheating on her and her thoughtful, caring friends offer their support.  At least, that's what the descriptions says.  Actually, it's just one long guilt trip.

First guilt tripper is her mother, who says if Mary divorces, it'll hurt her daughter.  To drive home that message, we see a sad-faced daughter moping around and blaming her mother for everything.  What's being ignored is Mary's right to protect her mental health as well as the father's role in hurting his daughter.  If he cared about his daughter's feelings, he wouldn't have put his marriage in jeopardy the way he did.

The person who lays it on real thick, though, is her supposed friend Edie (Debra Messing).  After Edie confesses to her own affair, she angrily tells Mary that her husband forgave her because he's a good man.  The clear message is that if Mary doesn't also forgive, then she's a bad person.  So much for moral support!

When her friends find out the husband is cheating, they withhold the truth from Mary, claiming to protect her.  But withholding the truth doesn't protect Mary.  It protects her husband who gets to avoid the negative consequences of his actions while continuing to have his cake and eat it, too.  Their silence also meant Mary found about the affair from a complete stranger instead of her own friends.

Another supposed friend is Sylvie (Annette Benning) who throws Mary under the bus to protect her own career.  Even her housekeeper only tries to preserve Mary's marriage, not for Mary's sake, but to save her own career.  Normally, I'd feel sorry for someone in Mary's shoes, but I couldn't because Mary is so spineless.

First, Mary blames her husband's mistress for the affair, believing the mistress came on so strong, the poor guy didn't stand a chance.  She then makes a fool of herself, demanding the mistress let her husband go, as if he's being held hostage.  She forgets her husband entered the affair freely and the only didn't leave because he's spineless, too.

In the end, Mary concludes that the reason her husband cheated was because she wasn't a whole person.  Now that she's supposedly whole, they can be together again.  However, her husband didn't cheat because of what Mary lacked.  He cheated because of what he lacked - good character.

These messages disturbed me because too often, the betrayed spouse gets unfairly blamed for adultery.  I also didn't like how glibly adultery is presented.  Although there's one scene where Mary cries over being cheated on, for the most part, she's not too affected by it.  Shortly after discovering her husband's adultery, she's even laughing and having a good time with her mom.

Besides the unfair guilt trips and glib portrayal of adultery, this movie also suffers from bad acting (especially the miscast Jada Pinkett-Smith).  Overall, this movie went from bad to worse.",1285804800,10,2918,4.9059304703476485

As in both versions, one does not notice that there are no men in the film - and they are not missed! Meg Ryan was excellent as she was able to tone the overblown gestures and expressions used by Norma Shearer who never seemed to be able to distance herself from her old silent film days. (I always felt she got such juicy roles as this because she was married to MGM head Irving Thalberg. The 1939 film was over-budgeted, over-produced, and over-acted making for a campy movie to match Shearing's over-the-top style. Check out her version of ""Marie Antoinette"" [1938] - it so syrupy it'll give you diabetes!) Annette Bening's portrayal of Sylvia was superb as was Debra Messing. Eva Mendes totally captured the new millennium gold digger. Jada Pinkett Smith had the most difficult role as her character would have been the most scandalous and banned from the earlier film. These women were strong, intelligent, and independent in their own ways. Watching Meg Ryan come into her own was uplifting while Candace Bergen's revelations of a ""life unfulfulled"" was indicative of women of her era. All of the negative reviews here have no merit. This is well-written screenplay with an outstanding cast of women. Females watchers should learn to be open and supportive of a film with a female director and all female cast. Men can either take something positive from the film or not say anything negative at all since they obviously aren't able to understand the complex parts which make up a real woman of this time and this place.

3169971,4,B0017ANAZO,"I discovered this film one day while I was flipping channels.  When it started I thought it seemed like it would be a short-half hour situation comedy.  But as it developed into a two-hour film I found myself very interested, especially when, about a quarter way into the story I realized that there was not one single man in the cast.

This is the story of women's friendships and the two main characters are played by Meg Ryan and Annette Bening.  Annette Bening is cast as a sophisticated career woman and in the first scene she goes for a manicure at Saks Fifth Avenue and hears the manicurist gossiping about Meg Ryan's husband who is having an affair with a girl who works at the perfume counter.  Annette tries to keep this information from her friend but eventually it comes out.  Meg Ryan looks beautiful in this role of a suburban housewife whose world seems to fall apart.  Candace Bergan is cast has her mother and her role is interesting too.

Soon, I got involved in the story.  The characters were a bit overdone but I definitely related to them.  And I loved the happy ending too.

Later, I discovered that this was a remake of a 1939 film which was supposed to be a real winner.  I never saw that film (but maybe I will someday) so I had nothing to compare this version to.  This might not be the greatest film in the world but not every film is destined for Academy Awards.  Some are just simply to enjoy.",1268524800,3,1423,4.402298850574713

3169976,3,B0017ANAZO,"Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) is a successful housewife. Her busy schedule keeps her name on the lips of society and her daughter adores her, but it seems her husband is discontent. Steven Haines is having an affair with a perfume girl (Eva Mendes). Suddenly the gossip is out, and although her friends (Annette Benning, Debra Messing, Jada Pinkett Smith) try to help her deal with the pain of the situation, Mary decides to divorce her husband.

The movie starts strong. The dialogue is witty, the characters are energetic and interesting, and the plot moves along nicely. It is updated to modern times flawlessly, and these girls resemble the famous friends from Sex in the City.

Toward the end, however, the movie veers off into an alley of sentiment and turns into a full-on chic-flick. We see a woman become independent and powerful and achieve the dreams she never realized, made for audiences to shout ""You go, girl!"" in the background. Best friends have a fight and then cry together over their great relationship. It all culminates in a delivery room where women bond over the ability to have babies. Disgusting.

Still, this re-make is superior to that starring June Allyson and Joan Collins which is much less exciting in spite of how cheesy this one becomes.

It is always nice to see a great screen writer from the past appear in the credits of a film, even if it isn't a wonderful remake. However, it retains a lot of the great elements of the past. There are no men in his film, a gimmick ignored in the Allyson remake but a memorable part of the original.

3169990,3,B0017ANAZO,"Diane English picked up and rearranged the missing pieces of the romantic comedy genre, based on the multidimensional affective feminine universe. But smartly she focuses her whole attention around seven well defined characters; the first three are of course Meg Ryan as the devoted wife always trying to shine as human being. But living into a happy bubble (living in a beautiful home at Connecticut, married with a successful executive and supported by her best friend (Annette Bening) - the second main character - she will have to have to face the world when she hits the bottom at the moment she realizes her husband cheats her with the alluring Eva Mendes. The third main character is her mother (the lovable and still beautiful Candice Bergen) who will support her according her particular style, and finally we have Ryan's daughter a girl who's living the hard transition of the adolescence (with its doubts and fears)  . But the other three secondary roles turn around Eva Mendes the seductive lover of Stephen Haines, (who looks fine in this role); the pregnant friend (who expects this birth with hope and illusion) and the lesbian character (who lives with a super model).

New York is the big stage, the fashion world and its well known dissonances rounds an entire and passable film with a happy ending when the different destinies of these women intersect themselves.

Curiously there's no single shot with a masculine character all the way through. We just listen far references (as the telephone call with Ryan's husband).

A very well written script makes of this movie a pleasant and enriching experience for making us think.

It's not only the lack of any actor with a Y chromosome that makes The Women feel like it should be airing on the Lifetime network: between the ham-handed direction, weak writing, and superfluity of characters in a short film, The Women is a featherlight comedy that might be the type of film to watch on an airplane but that's about the best recommendation I can muster.

3169995,3,B0017ANAZO,"""The Women"" was a dollar rental from that trusty RedBox that our grocery stores around here have.  What a relief!  The story is centered around Meg Ryan's character- who finds out that her loving and doting husband is cheating on her.  Meg Ryan and her beautiful hair and angelic face- cheating on HER?  Meg has a band of girlfriends including gruff and streetwise Jada Pinkett-Smith, goofy Debra Messing and smart and sophisticated Annette Benning.  So, where does that leave the other famous actress on the cover?  Eva Mendes is the mistress.  Of course.  With those curves and that mouth... Fine, I can see why.

But!  Meg Ryan's girls flock around her and push her to do the dirty work that she is usually too feeble to do.  She screams and swears and gets her nails done!  Meg Ryan has always been a little aloof in her movies, but I'd be okay to admit that this movie is one of her finer performances.  I think between her and Annette Benning, I'm hard pressed who made this film the measely 3 stars that it is.  Without them, the whole thing would have been a disaster.

The story is overdone and we've seen all angles of this thing, but... I was willing to watch someone do it one more time.  ""The Women"" didn't show me anything new.  Nothing surprised me.  Meg Ryan did a stellar performance of being the doting and happy wife, to the angry and depressed, yet ANGRY adulteree (is that a word?).  I enjoyed watching her transformation.

The director did not use Debra Messing's natural ability to entertain, make jokes (yes), but also to offer insight.  I usually enjoy Messing's work, but this one just left me thinking she is entirely too quirky and had no serious moments in the entire movie.  Jada Pinkett-Smith, I'll admit, I haven't seen her in many movies, but this one was overacted and I couldn't wait for her to get off the screen.  Obviously she isn't a street person in real life, but I am not supposed to know that, as the viewer.  Not a good performance at all.  The few times that Eva Mendes was on screen, she seemed surly and pouting, and at times bitchy- but rarely did I see her account for her actions- especially when Meg Ryan actually confronts her.  Eva is hardly in the movie at all, which for this particular film, is a blessing.  She would have only botched it up more.

This gets a three stars.  If Meg Ryan and Annette Benning hadn't done such a great job, it would have gotten a two stars for the script writing and the others overacting.  It was bearable, but not something I will probably ever watch again.",1254960000,2,2545,4.493449781659389
3169996,4,B0017ANAZO,"Sure, women can have it all these days.  But the question posed by Diane English in her 2008 update on THE WOMEN is: do they really want it all?

If anyone was going to create a modern-day spin on Clare Boothe Luce's catty 1930's Broadway play, THE WOMEN (made famous in the 1939 MGM movie starring Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford), it was ""Murphy Brown"" scribe Diane English.  While time has rolled on, the problems concerning women certainly haven't.

When down-to-earth Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) discovers that her husband has taken on a seductive perfume counter clerk named Crystal Allen (Eva Mendes) as his mistress, she paints her nails jungle-red and reinvents herself as a boutique fashion designer - but not without some support from her faithful gal-pals including magazine editor Sylvie (Annette Bening), ""serial mother"" Edie (Debra Messing) and outspoken lesbian author Alex (Jada Pinkett Smith).

As in the original, no man ever appears on screen, and Ms English has wisely retained many of the best lines from the source material (there's also a clever black-and-white twist on the original's Technicolor fashion show sequence!) .  While a lot of what English newly creates for the remake might seem fresh and cutting edge - ie: Mary's eleven-year-old daughter (India Ennenga) who starts smoking to suppress her appetite - I think she's tried too hard to cram in as many modern elements as possible, making the film seem overstuffed with information.  The crux of the story remains Mary's reinvention, and Meg Ryan portrays that nicely.  And I appreciate the fact that, unlike the original in which we see Norma Shearer (as Mary) tearfully running back into her husband's arms; the question of whether Mary will in fact return to her marriage is left up to the audience.

Fantastic performances all-round, particularly from Messing, Bening and Pinkett Smith as the main trio; Cloris Leachman is the Haines housekeeper and has some great scenes, and no Diane English film would be complete without ""Murphy Brown"" herself, Candice Bergen, who plays Mary's mother.  Bette Midler has an all-too-brief bit as a burnt-out, multiple-divorced Hollywood agent.  There are also appearances from Joanna Gleason, Carrie Fisher and Ana Gasteyer.",1252281600,2,2244,5.15426997245179

The actors, though generally outstanding in other vehicles, just weren't good in this endeavor. The acting was noticeably bad. The only standouts for me were Cloris Leachman and Debra Messing at the end. She was hilarious to me. In fact, her character seemed to have the only real honest reactions in the whole movie. I did enjoy the beautiful scenery and fabulous fashions.  I also actually liked the soundtrack which I'm going to check out further. Bottom line?

3169998,1,B0017ANAZO,"When Hollywood remakes a classic, it does so with a vengeance, in this case 1939s ""The Women"", a tale of New York socialite Mary Haines (Norma Shearer in 1939, Meg Ryan in 2008) whose husband is stolen by an opportunistic hussy. In the original, a careless gossip reveals a scandalous affair, a girl from the wrong side of the tracks poaching the man of a beloved, gentle woman and faithful wife. Like the current remake, no one suffers financial distress in either film. Where such movies served to distract a country burdened by the long years of the Depression, the 2008 version is nothing but a paean to Sex and the City and its ilk.

The crisp, acerbic dialog that fed the drama of a heartless housebreaker determined to secure her future in 1939 has been watered down to support vague cameo appearances, but the context is lost in a twisted mess of improbable solutions and sloppy writing. When Mary Haines gathers with ladies in similar situations getting ""quickie"" divorces in Reno 1939, the modern group goes to a health farm, where Ryan smokes a joint with Bette Midler and ruminates on where she's gone wrong. While the first film offered fresh faces destined for long term stardom, Eve Arden, Paulette Goddard, Rosalind Russell and Joan Crawford, the new one is a rogue's gallery of cosmetically altered actresses, some more gruesome than others.

Meg Ryan- sporting a mouth that is part Meg, part Calista Flockhart and part Michelle Pheiffer- sullies Shearer's former role with braggadocio about her performance in the bedroom (something about nails and boards) and a hapless Annette Benning apologizes for exposing her friend to the rabid tabloid gossip. Bette Midler makes a bold, if shocking cameo, as though she stumbled onto the wrong set. And what could be more absurd than casting Crawford's iconic role with the sultry Eva Mendes (the extent of her role is a few lines delivered in sexy lingerie or in a bath tub)? Sadly, the coming to self of a married woman still in love with an unfaithful husband becomes Ryan's tongue-in-cheek parody of a new identity, complete with Annie Lennox anthem in the background.

For all the wasted efforts of such greats as Candice Bergin and Cloris Leachman, there are a few stellar moments: 5 stars to Annette Benning for a performance that transcends the vapid material, a short, but punchy role by Debi Mazar, the gossipy nail lady who spreads the rumors and a terrific one-liner by natural comedic actress Ana Gasteyer. In contrast, Jada Pinkett-Smith is a brash lesbian, Debra Messing's considerable talent is wasted, and Carrie Fisher? Well, she's just... Carrie Fisher.

An iconic comedy of manners and the danger of gossip is turned into a frivolous chick flick in an effort that does no justice to the sophistication of the original in this uncomfortable ensemble piece. It says something about the state of filmmaking for actresses over forty when all the public is offered is this warmed up hash with neither plot nor substance, a sad commentary when talented actresses are forced to alter their faces to remain relevant in a youth-obsessed society. Shame on Hollywood- and the screenwriter, producers and director- for presenting these actresses with such substandard fare. Luan Gaines/2009.",1248566400,30,3258,4.972477064220183
3169999,1,B0017ANAZO,"I seriously don't get movies like these.

It's a storyline that's *completely* pointless.  The constant talking going on between the women playing the lead characters doesn't MEAN anything.  The focal point of the storyline is something so ordinary and bland that it doesn't mean anything.

It doesn't matter if it's men or women- when the lead characters constantly talk about subjects that mean absolutely nothing to anyone except themselves, the film can't be saved, and there's honestly nothing even remotely interesting about ordinary every day city problems involving people in relationships and other minor things.

Imagine this- you go to the mall, hear a couple of men or women having conversations about their family and friends, and then follow them around the mall as they continue talking about their minor problems.  That's basically what happens throughout The Women.  The only difference is that, instead of a mall, it's all over a city.

Who in the world thought this was a good idea for a storyline?  And good enough to make a MOVIE out of it?  Don't make me laugh!

And although Debra Messing came very close to having that same comedic timing that the '39 cast showed - the 2008 version just doesn't stand up next to the 1939 - nor will it stand the test of time.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Count the stars - Meg Ryan (Mary), Annette Bening (Mary's best friend Sylvia), Debra Messing (Mary's permanently pregnant friend Edie), Jada Pinkett-Smith (Mary's gay writer pal Alex), Candice Bergen (Mary's Mom), Bette Midler, Carrie Fisher, Cloris Leachman, Debi Mazar, and (ta-dah) Eva Mendes as ""the spritzer girl"" Crystal.
2. All star cast proves that too many chicks spoil the broth.
3. Main characters Mary and Sylvia dominate a ho-hum girlfriend drama that could have been so much more with the addition of humor and some good old fashioned beyotchiness.
4. All the other actresses are criminally underutilized
5. Back to the story (what little there is) - birds of a feather flock together when a cuckoo moves in on Mary's nest.
6. That's one heckuva sexy cuckoo
7. ... and one heckuva messy nest

The problem here is believability.  Quite simply, it's not.

Recommended for a bonding afternoon with the girls over ice cream and chocolate cake, and better yet, ditch the movie after the Saks underwear scene and get your nails done instead.

They all add something to this movie to make it more than just a woman done wrong story.  It's about a woman that finds out that underneath all the endless parties, gardening and other busy things.

3170029,1,B0017ANAZO,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the original 1930s version of this movie so when I found out that there would be a modernized version, I was very excited to see it.

In case you haven't seen the original, it's about a woman who's living the fabulous life but finds out her ""loving"" husband is cheating on her with a perfume girl at ""Blacks.""  Her friends find out about it before she does (from a mancurist of all people) and they debate whether or not to tell her.  Mary (the one with the no-good, frog-faced, rougish, rat fink dog of a husband) finds out herself from the same mancurist and her Mom's advices her on what to do.  Mom suggests that she does nothing b/c if the husband really loved the girl, Mary would have felt it long ago and if she gets her friends involved then she'll just have another thing that she'll have to deal with.

Mary finally confronts the other woman (Crystal) that's creeping around with her husband in a dressing room.  After Crystal obviously has no remorse about what she's doing, Mary confronts Steven (the rat) and says she wants a divorce.

She gets the divorce in Reno but realizes too late that neither of them really want the divorce.  Steven feels that it is his duty to marry Crystal to protect what was left of her reputation.  (Yeah, I know, but men were a bit more chivalrous back then, which is pretty cool b/c nowadays some men leave ya with nothing more than a a kick in the teeth).

Over a year passes and Mary still loves Steven and by now Steven can't stand Crystal.  Mary finds out that Crystal is cheating on Steven and devises a way to expose Crystal and get Steven back.  She does, the end.

Fast forward to 2008 and what happens?!  A total disappointment!!  Okay, that wasn't completely accurate.  On its own I give it 1 1/4 out of 5 stars b/c the movie provide a few chuckles but as a modern day adaptation 1 1/2 and that's only because they did stay true to the plot for the most part.  I also give it props b/c it dealt with issues that women face today like the influence of the media on women's body images.  Good show for that.  But, even though it kept your attention (for me, it was mostly out of pure curiosity), it wasn't the laugh fest that I thought it would be.  Also, they wrote out my favorite character (Miriam Aarons) so it was all over for me.

3170033,2,B0017ANAZO,"AARP proudly presents.... (just kidding)

Anyway, I like female oriented films. And I definitely love Eva Mendes. But, all the other women of this film were really too old to me to be able to embrace as an enjoyable film about women. Even Meg Ryan has lost her appeal to me and yet she is younger than me. I've always thought Jada Pinkett Smith was hot, but in this film, playing a bad-tempered lesbian kinda put me off. I've never understood the appeal of Debra Messing even when she was younger, and I've seen Annette Benning in a few films, either mature themed (The American President), or just in bad taste (American Beauty), so seeing her again (and older), just didn't capture my appeal very well. We never did see Meg Ryan's husband in this film. So, since no character development of him could be established, I guess it's easy to just make him the ""bad guy"" in this failing marriage. Meg Ryan even showed that she was too busy to help her own daughter with a school project so I had no pity for her role even if her husband did find a young hottie (like Eva Mendes) to fulfill the emptiness in his life. A neglected husband (or even a neglected wife) can easily stray towards someone who also needs some temporary affection. And, if a man's got money, there's no reason to resist temptation. I've heard it said: ""A man is only as loyal as his options.""

For the age of these women who make up the star cast, even Bette Midler, Carrie Fisher, and Candice Bergen aren't all that much older than the main cast. If they needed an older woman in here for some kind of elderly influence, they really needed to seek out a silver screen dinosaur. That's where we get Cloris Leachman. For all we know, she could have been in the original 1939 version.

This movie's appeal is right there between ""Designing Women"" and ""The Golden Girls"". Anyway, I saw it, and I wasn't too impressed, probably because I'm still too young to relate to any of these women's problems. They were all rather old, cold, and shallow. Of these women, what man could possibly be proud to say: ""This is my wife!"" ? Not me. I couldn't care about anybody in this film, and I tried. No wait, I did like Eva Mendes. No doubt about that! She gave the movie some hope, and represented the closest you're gonna get for the man to have anything to support his inevitable desire to stray.

So, if you're someone over the age of 60, this film is probably for you. However, if you are a younger male and if you want a good fun ""babefest"" film, watch ""Chasing Papi"", ""B!tch Slap!"", ""Man of the House"", ""So Close"", ""D.E.B.S."", ""D.O.A."", ""Cloud 9"", ""Alfie"" (with Jude Law), or even ""Bride and Prejudice"" (the one with Aishwarya Rai).",1235779200,,2693,4.467479674796748

3170035,3,B0017ANAZO,"George Cukor made this film in 1939 with an all female cast and it was much livelier. But first a little story:

Every year at the Castro theater (the oldest theater in California) in San Francisco's gay Castro district, the owner shows this film to a sold out crowd. You can barely understand the dialogue as every person in the audience repeats every single damn line in the movie after having watched it SO many times. Once you get into the party atmosphere, its pretty amazing. The lines are quick, sharp and bitchy and the audience never stops talking or laughing throughout. If you can catch this experience you'll save yourself from this remake.

Meg Ryan (too pretty), Annette Bening (not believable), Jada Pinkett Smith (just mean), Eva Mendes (just mean), Debra Messing (Debra Messing redux), Cloris Leachman (great performance), Bette Midler (same Bette), Carrie Fisher (very brief), Joanna Gleason (okay), and Candice Bergen (well cast) sound like a cast that could only win in any film, but this remake is a dud. Sure, there are a few good lines here and there, but it's bitchy without being funny. It borders more on the mean-spirited side, rather than on the clever and outrageous.

3170049,4,B0017ANAZO,"I am lucky enough to remember the earlier movie of The Women, and can compare this one with some degree of fairness.  The first thing one realizes is that movies today are better and the emotional freight is portrayed closer to reality than any of the movies of the contract studios ever were.  The encouragement with which the manicurist is enticed to divulge her secret is less catty than the earlier film, and the moment of understanding is more emotionally detached than the drama with which it was portrayed in the earlier film.  Detached in the sense that Ryan's character is stunned and in a traumatic funk rather than ""the betrayed woman.""  Then she is angry.  I remember the earlier film and the corny betrayal distress that was the major theme of that film.  Ryan infuses her role with angry humor and strength rather than weak femininity.

I love seeing Meg Ryan in more mature roles now that she has gotten beyond the ingenue period.  Annette Bening is a superb foil as the close and angry friend.  A great cast.

I am also much pleased to see that women are protrayed more realistically.  During the days of the contract studios, almost all roles, especially women's roles, were  stereotyped and all too often the caliber of acting was far below what we can see today.  This movie has a great cast and its own restructuring of those roles to fit into todays lifestyles and concerns.",1234137600,4,1395,4.668032786885246
3170050,4,B0017ANAZO,"I enjoyed this remake of George Cukor's classic 1939 film.  While Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford and Rosalind Russell headed an excellent cast in a sparkling film, Diane English does a good job bringing this update to the screen.  The DVD special features are informative as we hear about what a labor of love this was for English, the long fuse of financing and numerous screenplay drafts before the the project could be brought to screen.

Meg Ryan plays Mary Haines whose husband is having an affair.  Ryan was one of the top romantic comedy starts in the 80s & 90s with great classics such as her Golden Globe nominated ""When Harry Met Sally"" & ""Sleepless in Seattle.""  She tugs at our heartstrings as the woman forced to come out of her shell and gain a better sense of herself.

Annette Bening who I loved in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Open-Range/dp/B0000TANUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Open Range</a>&nbsp;and who has been nominated for an Oscar three times for ""The Grifters,"" ""American Beauty"" & ""Being Julia"" does a good job as the anti-domestic career woman Sylvie Fowler.  This was Rosalind Russell's role in the original.  Bening is always interesting to watch.  Her scenes with Mary's daughter show variety and range.

In the DVD extras, English said she questioned whether 82-year-old Cloris Leachman would be up to doing a role.  But Leachman, whose Oscar was for ""The Last Picture Show,"" glistens as the saucy housekeeper Maggie whose personal opinions keep her continually on the verge of quitting.

Eva Mendes showed me what great depth she has an actress in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/We-Own-the-Night/dp/B000ZS8GWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">We Own the Night</a>.  She may be one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood.  As Crystal Allen, the girl most willing to have an affair with a married man, she combines the elegance & barb of Joan Crawford with street sleaze.  Her scene in the dressing room trying on lingerie makes you want to scratch her eyes out.  She's a delight!

Candace Bergen, who was nominated for an Oscar in 1979 for ""Starting Over,"" reflects great presence as Mary's mother Catherine Frazier.  In her scenes, we are treated to a sizzling cameo performance.  Bette Midler who has two Oscar nominations of her own (""For the Boys"" & ""The Rose"") plays Leah Miller, drying out with Mary.  She is intense, charming and flamboyant in her limited screen time.

Debra Messing from TV's ""Will & Grace"" plays Edie Cohen, the eternally pregant friend of Mary's.  Her comic timing is great.  Jada Pinkett Smith as the gay Alex Fisher adds spice.  I enjoyed her as the maverick captain in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix-Revolutions-2-Disc-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0001BKAEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix Revolutions (2-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>.  Debi Mazar does a great job as the brassy manicurist Tanya who loves to gossip.  Carrie Fisher from ""Star Wars"" has a brief scene on an exercise bike as reporter Bailey Smith.

Overall, the film works well.  I hope it stimulates people to want to check out the great George Cukor film as well as Clare Boothe Luce's excellent stage play.  Enjoy!",1233792000,2,3287,5.557344064386318

It was hard to believe that they would even be friends; a stereotypical lesbian, earth mother, career woman and the ""happily"" married working mother. I didn't care about any of these women. This is a good movie to pick up at your local library and watch for free to pass a few hours but that's about all it's worth.",1233360000,8,400,4.418918918918919
3170053,4,B0017ANAZO,"The Women is a chick flick; there is no use denying it.  But I am surprised that so many did not enjoy it; I unabashedly did.  I thought that Meg Ryan did a credible job in this movie and I enjoyed the cast tremendously.  Love Annette Bening, Cloris Leachman and Candice Bergen.  Ms. Bergen almost ran away with the film; she was so good.  Meg's daughter in the movie (India Ennenga) did an outstanding job as the little girl who is almost forgotten and ignored when Mom becomes absorbed with her own emotions and loss of self esteem.

A little bit of Eckart Tolle finds its way into the movie in the form of some of the spirituality messages which abound in his book The Power of Now.  Meg Ryan asks herself finally, ""What Do You Want?""  Easy enough question to ask; but very hard to answer when you have forgotten what you wanted in the first place out of life and submerged your own goals and aspirations in lieu of what your family or successful spouse wanted to achieve.

At a deeper level, I think the movie discusses admirably how women can take a detour and lose their self esteem while bolstering their family, children and others.  Many times they do not take the time to take some selfish interest in their own needs, desires and goals and they sadly lose their way in life.  Another subliminal message deals with marriage and the importance of keeping the relationship alive by focusing on being happy with yourself and what you bring to the relationship.  Friendship and betrayal of trust are also front and center; and when a person becomes fearful or pushed to the wall; how loyal and trustworthy would they be?  Would you sell out your friendship or your ideals to hold a job or to advance yourself or to save your own neck?

At a psychological and spiritual level, I think the movie really works.  It examines those motivations and life events that many women just take for granted and/or ignore.  Many times women think that what happens in break-ups or marital conflict only happens to other people next door or other family members; until it hits home.  This is very much a story of how a woman picks up the pieces and gets to know herself and exactly what she wants out of life and from herself.

I liked the movie; I love Meg Ryan and Candy Bergen; it was a very entertaining film and it may hit close to home; more than you might expect.  And there is always Bette Midler thrown in for good measure.

And the trick question: There was only one male in the entire movie; who was it?  You may overlook it if you are not careful!  And if you only get one thing from the movie; if you actually start thinking about what you really want; the time spent will not be wasted; but very well worth it and even enjoyable!  There are many good laughs in this film; and everyone can learn to even hate Crystal Allen (the beautiful Eva Mendes who is the ole spritzer gal).

3170062,1,B0017ANAZO,"Women should be disgusted and insulted by the rash of ""chick flicks"" put out by Hollywood in recent years where women are concerned with little else than shopping and romance. This movie features some very good actresses, but the material is banal and completely lacking in depth.
Meg Ryan plays a rich woman who spends her time doing ""fundraising,"" and although she has only one child, somehow requires a full-time housekeeper (Cloris Leachman) and au pere girl to keep it all going.

Annette Bening, one of the greatest actresses ever, seems to be doing an exact impression of Samantha Jones from Sex and the City; someone should have reminded her that she's too old to play this sort of role. It's a fluff piece better suited to that nitwit Anne Hathaway.
The strangest thing about this movie is the complete absence of any men. All the extras are women; in street scenes, there is not a man to be seen anywhere. This gimmick would be affective if the film were not so utterly void of substance. It's as though a statement is trying to be made, but when the whole plot is about Meg's unfaithful husband and how she ""wins"" him back, it becomes all the more irrelevent. And how does she win him back? By becoming a fashion designer and presenting her rather unoriginal inspirations in a typical flashy New York gala. It happens effortlessly; and suddenly she's loveable again and worthy of her husband's attention.
Fashion is far more important than raising money for charities.

Debra Messing's part is so appalling it isn't even worth mentioning, but the worn-out child bearing scene was nauseating. Jada Pinkett-Smith is the ill-cast token lesbian who has to be freaked out by all things baby related. The acting is over-the-top, and the whole plot is silly. Hands down, the only good scenes belong to Canadace Bergen, and whoever wrote her lines should have taken over the whole script because hers are the only ones with any substance or authenticity.
Women in their late 40s and early 50s should not be in appalling films such as this. They should be portraying politicians, movers, shakers, thinkers - women who have lived, experienced, and are taken seriously outside the realm of men, money, and Gucci bags. In other words, women of substance who actually have something to offer other than shopping at Saks and getting their nails done.",1231459200,16,2347,4.8213399503722085
3170063,2,B0017ANAZO,"As movies go, it was not terrible.  It had great comedic moments, like Annette Benning's initial conversation with the gossippy manicurist.  However, why didn't they just hire Kim Cattrall to play that role?  It was essentially the same character as SATC's Samantha.  In fact, Kristin Davis would have played the Debra Messing character perfectly, and Sarah Jessica Parker even has the same wild hair Meg Ryan's character had.  Candice Bergen was already in SATC so her placement in The Women was a short reach. I also must add that Jada Pinkett Smith is too talented and beautiful to be relegated to the token black/ lesbian sidekick.  And quite frankly, Annette Benning's snippy comment to the woman with the dog at the beginning of the movie-about how she was wearing last years shoes- made me smirk.  Lady, (and yes, I know she was a fictional character) most of the world can't afford shoes and the rest of us shop at Payless.

The plot centers around Mary Haines, whose husband is having an affair with a perfume salesgirl at Saks.  Mary hears about it from a gossipy manicurist, and once the cat is out of the bag, her mother and her girlfriends are full of advice for her, some good and some not so good.  The interaction between the female characters is fast and furious and would best be appreciated by women (I can't imagine many men who would sit through this or come close to ""getting it"".)  There are lots of enjoyable performances, from the sweet heroine Mary, played by Meg Ryan, to the hilarious Bette Midler as a talent agent that Mary meets at a retreat.

3170081,3,B0017ANAZO,"There is much to admire about the 2008 remake of the 1939 comedy classic ""The Women"". How about that cast!  Having such a large assemblage of talented and attractive actors in one movie is  impressive.  The fact that Diane English, the creator of the groundbreaking comedy series ""Murphy Brown,"" is responsible for this new version of ""The Women"" is reassuring.  It is wonderful that she opened doors for as many capable women to work behind the scenes as in front of the camera for this movie.  This rarely happens today.  Another positive is the way that the women's onscreen relationships with one another have evolved from the backstabbing bitchiness of the 1939 original to a more loyal and compassionate nature in the 2008 remake.

But there are obvious weaknesses in ""The Women"".  The characters in this updated version have the potential to be more complex and substantive than their predecessors.  Yet Diane English's script only scratches the surface of these women's identities.  There is scant detail about their individual lives, histories, and goals.  The characters are presented more as ""types"" than as three-dimensional women, i.e., Meg Ryan plays the good wife;  Annette Bening portrays the ambitious career woman;  Debra Messing is the frazzled mom;  Jada Pinkett Smith, the tough lesbian;  Eva Mendes, the man-eating home wrecker, etc.

Credit the experience and resourcefulness of the superb acting ensemble  who manage to bring texture and depth to characters that the story fails to fully develop.  The genuine warmth and respect you feel between these talented actors off-camera enhance their onscreen relationships as well.

Ms. English, whose writing for the classic comedy series ""Murphy Brown"" was truly masterful and funny, seems rusty here.  Her humor sometimes feels forced and occasionally falls flat.

But Diane English deserves praise for bringing an all-female cast back to the big screen.  It's ironic that in the 21st century women supposedly have less value in movies than they did 70 years ago.  This makes no sense and must change.",1230854400,2,2071,5.190332326283988
3170082,3,B0017ANAZO,"""A Female Friendship Film"" is what I would call ""The Women"". A weak remake of the 1939 classic.  I recently rented the DVD (glad I didn't go the movies to see this).  I tried not to compare the  two movies but it was hard not to.  The remake came up short...but if I don't compare them than it is an okay film.  The remake has a totally different feel from the original.  I would describe it as lame!  There is no energy, no drama, no face slapping or cat fights among the women.  They are BORING!  In the 1939 film every woman scratched her way to the top (wearing Jungle Red nail polish).

Meg Ryan (Mary) has made a career in playing ""good girl"" roles.  She is good...no surprise there. Annette Benning is also good as Mary's best friend ""Sylvia"".  That's the problem...she is much more likable in this film.  Benning's ""Sylvia"" would have been much more interesting if she had been bitchier, flawed, with maybe some redemption thrown in at the end.  I did like the scene where Mary and Sylvia made up.  Eva Mendes (Crystal), who is the ""other woman"", should have been a BITCH!  She needed to show how conniving she is...a real GOLD DIGGER!  It would have been fun to see her act mean to ""poor Mary"".  I got a kick out of Cloris Leachman, as the housekeeper because she can do no wrong in my book.  She has made the best of her acting roles even when the parts were below her standard.

The part that I did not think worked well was ""Alex"", Mary's ""lesbian"" friend (they had to make a point of making sure you knew she was gay and how the straight friends seem to tolerate it).  Jada Pinkett Smith can't act!  Her role would not have been missed if it had been cut out.  Debi Mazar, who played the gossipy manicurist can't act that well either.  Years ago she had a more interesting look (more severe) than she does now.  Bette Midler was GREAT in her bit part and it would have been greater if it had been BIGGER and she looked better.  They made her look old and tired.  Her talk was even slower.  What a waste ...but hey, it just shows that the Divine Miss M can do older, slower talking, dumpy looking characters...she's versatile!

Diane English wrote and directed this film.  I can tell she is a nice person.  It shows in her film.  A gay man would have done a better job(at least a bitchy gay man).

The ending was dumb.  Come on... Debra Messing (Edie) screaming in agony while giving birth and everyone is running around acting silly.

3170085,5,B0017ANAZO,"Warning:  minor spoilers ahead.

I found this remake of the 1939 film The Women to be quite enjoyable.  I was worried that it was going to purge all the bitchiness of the original, but some of that remained, and it is quite witty and clever in other places and ways.

Even though it makes about as much sense to me to compare the two versions of The Women as it does to compare Massenet's Manon to Puccini's Manon Lescaut or Puccini's and Leoncavallo's versions of La Boh&egrave;me with each other, I'm going to do that anyway.  I'll say up front that I think there is room for both versions.

Contrary to what is implied in the trailer, the remake has more in common with the original than I had first thought.  It carries over several lines from the original, including two of the very best lines.  There are places where it is obvious that they are setting up to bring over one of the original wonderful lines and those sequences are lots of fun because of the anticipation that the line is coming.  The best line from the original (the one about the kennel), on the other hand, shows up with almost no warning and in a very different place, spoken by a different character.

The film doesn't follow the original scene-by-scene by any means.  There are some unusual plot twists such as having the phone call Crystal Allen gets at Saks Fifth Avenue, which is how it is known in this picture (as opposed to the thinly-disguised Black's in the original), take place at, rather than behind, the perfume counter, so that the women who are ""creeping up on her"" (this phrase is not carried over) get to witness the call.  Also the manicurist, who is called Tanya rather than Olga in this version, is brought back toward the end for an interesting plot twist.  There is a fashion show although in this version it is part of the story and not just a divertissement.  While the implication is there in the original that the writer character played by Jada Pinkett Smith has an alternative lifestyle, they leave no doubt of that in this version.

There are differences, of course.  Bette Midler plays the fairly small part of the Comtesse de Lave, who goes by a different name, although she acknowledges that sometimes people call her ""The Countess.""  While Buck (different last name, which I don't recall) is mentioned, nothing really comes of that subplot other than the implication that the Comtesse may end up making him husband number six.  Buck never gets involved with Crystal either.  The biggest change is the character of Sylvie (rather than Sylvia) Fowler, who does not gloat over Mary Haines' sufferings; she feels genuine remorse at having played a part in the publication of the story of the fight between Mary Haines and Crystal Allen.  She is loyal to Mary Haines throughout the film, even during the disruption in their friendship, and so she never makes friends with Crystal Allen.  In fact, it could easily be argued--especially on the basis of one of Mary Haines' lines--that Mary's relationship with Sylvie is more important to her than her relationship with Stephen.  Little Mary obviously thinks very highly of Sylvie as well.  Then again, this is much more a pro-woman picture than the original.  It was probably influenced to an extent by Sex and the City from what I gather (I haven't seen it), so it only makes sense that the women would take their relationships with each other very seriously.  Another difference is that there is one male character in this version although it is entirely possible that that character is at least played by a female.

Accordingly, since Sylvie and Crystal never become friends, Sylvie is not involved in the scene in Crystal's bathroom.  That scene, now only involving Crystal and Little Mary, brief as it is, tracks the original more closely than any other part of the film, or maybe it only seems that way because Eva Mend&eacute;s has obviously studied Joan Crawford and her speech patterns and reactions in that scene very closely.  There is another superfluous and not really believable--or maybe it is, in a way, given the way things are nowadays--plot twist involving Crystal, who otherwise does not reappear in the film after the scene in her bathroom, that comes out during the closing credits.

I thought it bogged down a bit about two-thirds of the way through the film, and perhaps that was because that was the place where it diverged the most from the original.  On the other hand, there were certainly places where I found the lines funny or where I was completely engaged in the film where those sections had nothing to do with the original.

I don't follow modern films that closely so I'll avoid detailed comments on the actresses.  I'll simply say that I thought the acting was good throughout and I really liked the girl who played Little Mary.  I wouldn't say she was better than the original, whose character and acting style was very much of that period.  The one actress in this film whose work I am familiar with is Debra Messing, from Will and Grace, and I must say that she has amazing breath control as is evidenced by the final scene.  The trailer made it look as though her role was much more prominent than it turns out to be, possibly to take advantage of her being possibly the best known actress of any in the film.  She is very important in the heartwarming ending, however.  Some of the important characters from the original are missing, such as those played by Paulette Goddard and Joan Fontaine.  Thre is no divorce ranch so there is no Marjorie Main either.  I wish the wonderful Carrie Fisher had had a larger role.

Anyway, aside from the little bit of time where the film bogs down in the middle, the two hours went by pretty quickly.  The Women is certainly a better film than the reputation it has garnered.  Comparing it to the original film, I probably would have only given it four stars.  However, since I think the film stands well on its own without reference to the very different original (which I also love), I'm giving it five.",1230422400,8,6036,4.665406427221172

Annette confides in their close circle--a circle consisting of gender bender Jada Pinkett-Smith and the ever-pregnant Debra Messing.  But delivery of the news by her friends is not necessary...as a manicure by the same nosy gossiper relieves them of their duty.

Everyone knew, some took sides, some acknowledged her, some didnt, and in the end, he called and told her to come home and she was ecstatic. I felt that movie said more about that time period than anything.

I felt the actresses in this movie, ""The Women"", were playing themselves. The only person that was funny and you felt for was Ms. Leachman. I couldn't feel for any of these people. And personally knowing many divorced women that don't shop at Saks, that aren't in high-power positions, I feel this movie was for a different demographic...I don't know which one.

In researching through Amazon today, I came across a book titled ""Factory Girls"" where the author describes chinese female factory workers who aren't ""passive victims"", and that instead the author found them to be ""resourceful and ambitious, full of plans to improve their lot and change their fates, willing to challenge their bosses and quit their jobs for better ones, and willing to take night classes to improve themselves"" and most importantly, they're not victims of circumstance.

I think it is safe to say that if you are a big fan of the original film, then this 2008 remake will be a huge letdown. Women have come a long way since 1939 and despite the hilarity of the the original film, the characters (desperate acting women who will stop at nothing at keeping their man, even if he is a no-good cheater) seem cartoonish today. Of course a literal re-do would be ludicrous today. However, even with modern female sensibilities thrown into the script for the remake, a talented ensemble of actresses fail to ignite a stale script. Annette Bening is fun to watch and manages to trigger a few laughs but Meg Ryan is colorless in the lead role and Debra Messing is just irritating (and I usually like her!). Eva Mendes is gorgeous in the role initially done by Joan Crawford, but she isn't given much to do. Jada Pinkett Smith seems to have been thrown in as an afterthough and wonderful actresses like Cloris Leachman and Candice Bergman bring little to the table.

3170105,2,B0017ANAZO,"This film fails on several levels. First off, the characters are unbelievable concocted affairs that attempt to be funny by speaking very quickly when delivering their largely boring dialogue. Overacted jib-and-jab banter is the norm here. Unfunny at best and un-watchable at worst, THE WOMEN is a slow, ponderous train wreck from start to finish. Some of the scenes are so poorly constructed that not even the frenetic back-and-forth dialogue that saturates the movie can bring any life to them.

Another problem is the gimmicky nature of the movie: there are no male actors in it at all. Not even extras. Gimmicks have and always will be about drawing attention to something that doesn't really deserve it. In this case, doubly so. Strewn with stereotypes, pithy anecdotes, and shabbily developed characters, it left this reviewer wondering what, if anything, the movie was supposed to be saying about the fairer sex. Certainly very little positive; even the daughter of one of them tries to burn her own tampons, desperate not to grow up to be one of the shallow, empty souls this movie presents as 'women.'

3170106,4,B0017ANAZO,"How clever to use ""The Women"" as a title for a film dealing exclusively with women! I say that both facetiously and seriously. The name ""Stephen Hanes"" is most often used in ""The Women,"" but he never appears. So, what is the message? Is there an easy answer to the problems between men and women? Not since Adam and Eve and that was a long long time ago.

""The Women"" makes the statement that forgiveness is a dish best served with a back-up plan. Meg Ryan, in a more mature role than she normally plays, is the one married to Stephen Hanes, who, everyone discovers, is having an affair. Why, for crying out loud? Meg's character is pretty, can do anything around the house, is involved in charity events, and claims to be great in bed. (For one thing that puffed up, kinky hair annoyed the heck out of me. And what's up with her lips, or out, I should say--Meg has the new, yucky, puffy lip style now.) As her mother (Candice Bergen) tells her, men admire women who achieve on their own.

So who's the man stealer? Eva Mendes in a hot, frankly--slutty role. She looks great! Does Meg keep a stiff upper lip (no pun intended) as her mother advises, or does she leave the scoundrel. Leave him she does and throws lives in chaos, particularly her daughter's, a tween.

Three generations, three reactions to a marital break-up. At a weekend retreat Meg learns from an edgy Bette Midler to live selfishly. Ask: What do I want? That begins Meg's regeneration as an independent person, particularly as a fashion designer, her life's goal until she married.

Other issues concerning women spring up in this mult-layered story:
1. Annette Benning (looking worse than I've ever seen her--what's up with that flat head?) is Meg's best friend. Their friendship is ruptured as a result of the separation and must be mended. She plays the successful single friend whose career has hit its peak. This is another issue.
2. Jada Pinkett Smith--in my honest opinion--plays the ""gay black"" friend. Her role in the movie did not feel authentic to me.
3. Why in the world would the gorgeous Debra Messing play that last scene? It was so grotesque and utterly unnecessary!
4. However, Candice Bergen's role as a matronly mother feels so right.
4. And why would a director keep Cloris Leachman so tightly zipped? Wasted talent there.

But the message is clear. Men are nice (sometimes), but they're really not to be trusted. (That statement also applies to hussies who leech married men of their time and money.)

A film with Annette Bening, Meg Ryan, Carrie Fisher, Cloris Leachman, Ana Gasteyer, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Debbie Mazar, and Debra Messing gives one an awful lot of talent to enjoy.

In little ways, there is a ""Sex and the City"" vibe (although there is no sex in this film).  Bening's magazine-editor character does have some Cynthia-Nixon-ish mannerisms, and Jada Pinkett-Smith's author-character reminded me at times of SATC's Carrie Bradshaw, that is, if Carrie had been a gorgeous black lesbian. But that is where the resemblances end.

And Eva Mendes, as the villainess of the piece (a Saks Fifth Avenue perfume counter shopgirl), has features that make her a Julia Roberts for the 21st century - all big doe eyes, and a 2000 megawatt smile.

Annette Bening is reliably vital and always welcome.  Debra Messing, just the opposite.  Meg Ryan, who looks disturbingly re-engineered, is somewhere in the middle.  Ms. Smith and Ms. Mendes are certainly adequate to their tasks, but there's just no saving this debacle.  I watched it with a growing sense of disappointment accompanied by moments of genuine horror.  Poor Meg Ryan has to say, when describing how she had reliably satisfied her husband in bed, ""I can suck the nails out of a board and that's a fact.""  (Try imagining Norma Shearer delivering THAT line.  No, perhaps you'd better not.)

3403985,5,B0017ANAZO,"The star power alone is reason enough to view this film, a remake of the 1939 original. Do yourself a favor and don't view this film or completely base your choice on whether or not to view it or buy it on reviews comparing it to the original. I viewed The Women, written and directed by Diane English, without any expectations. In this 21st century version, a group of four women, each a well-defined individual (although perhaps a bit stereotypical) reacts to and faces the topic of betrayal.

Meg Ryan, Mary, is a Connecticut housewife and philanthropist, raising a child with the help of a live-in nanny and a housekeeper (Cloris Leachman). Mary learns her high-profile husband is having an affair with the gorgeous ""spritzer girl,"" played by the VERY hot Eva Mendes. She works at the Saks' perfume counter. Mary's friend, Sylvia (played by Annette Bening) is a between-relationships/childless/magazine editor. She actually learns of the infidelity first and shares the news with their other two friends. Jada Pinkett Smith is Alex, an author/lesbian and Debra Messing plays the fertile-mertyl of the group, Edie, who is pregnant . . . again. Along with Mary's mother, played by Candice Bergen, the friends do their best to try and get Mary through this difficult time. It's by no means a smooth ride and the friendship between Sylvia and Mary is particularly tested. I thought the substance of friendship dynamics rang very true.

Definitely a chick-flick, but an intelligent one especially suited for middle-aged women. I don't think a single man makes an appearance in the film. Watch it with your girlfriends, sisters, mothers, aunts and / or daughters.

Based on Clare Booth Luce's shrewdly observant 1936 play on the relationships that evolve among a strictly female group of pampered Manhattan socialites, the story would seem ripe for a contemporary remake. Instead, because of English's thematic overreach, the production comes across as an extended therapy session with a paucity of wit. What's more, the diverse lifestyles of women today have been reduced to sitcom-level stereotypes in this movie, and the original play's central conceit of eliminating men from the storyline seems even more contrived given the openly pansexual evolution that has occurred among men as well as women since the 1930's. To add insult to injury, the recent big screen adaptation of HBO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-and-the-City/dp/B001DDBCUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex and the City</a>&nbsp;did this sort of sorority-style dishing much better and with far sharper fangs.

The skeleton of the original play remains as the story centers on wealthy Mary Haines, who gave up her promising clothing design career to become the devoted wife of a Wall Street financial wizard. Like ""Sex and the City"", she is surrounded by three best friends - Sylvie Fowler, a successful, cutthroat magazine editor in the mold of Miranda Priestly in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-Wears-Prada/dp/B000J103PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil Wears Prada</a>&nbsp;(yet another film this echoes); perennially pregnant Edie Cohen representing the stay-at-home wife; and Alex Fisher, a lesbian author who seems to represent every repressed group generally excluded from such an exclusive clique. Through a mouthy manicurist, they find out Mary's husband is having an affair with man-eater Crystal Allen, a perfume girl at Saks more than willing to break up a marriage as she struggles to become an actress. The rest of the plot doesn't matter much since it becomes a series of scenes focused on sisterly bonding and bickering, none of it very illuminating and without the satirical zing that buoyed the 1939 movie.

Looking strangely youthful at 47, Meg Ryan seems to play Mary in a manner that tries to resuscitate the goodwill she engendered in the 1990's with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-Harry-Met-Sally/dp/B000XJD33O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When Harry Met Sally...</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepless-in-Seattle/dp/B0000AOV4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepless in Seattle</a>. It's not that she isn't age-appropriate here, but her familiar sprightliness seems at odds with the character's passive nature. Annette Bening fares somewhat better in the scene-stealing Rosalind Russell role of Sylvie because she has proven to be adept at conveying hardness while masking vulnerability, but her character goes through such a trite transformation that it undermines the actress' performance severely. Poor Eva Mendes has to play Crystal as a shallow, transparent shopgirl versus the smart, hard-edged cookie Joan Crawford got to play. Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith are scooted way to the sidelines as Edie and Alex, respectively. Much better are Candice Bergen as Mary's savvy, supportive mother and Cloris Leachman as the non-nonsense housekeeper.

Probably reflecting the lackluster box office response to the film's release, the 2008 DVD doesn't have a robust set of extras. There are two deleted scenes - one with Crystal and her friends having a girls' night-in as a contrast to Mary's elaborate garden party, and the other an extension of Bette Midler's cameo as a multi-married Hollywood agent counseling Mary during a late night at a yoga camp. Two featurettes round out the extras - ""The Women: The Legacy"" about the history behind the film from the original 1936 play, and ""The Women Behind the Women"" which has cast and crew speak endlessly about female self-empowerment and self-image. The irony is that this version of ""The Women"" directed and scripted by a woman takes such a patronizing look at women.",1229904000,4,4457,6.315270935960591

Even though it steals so many of the witty lines from the original, which was released in 1939, this movie is so boring and badly acted that I barely could keep myself focused on watching it.

3403988,4,B0017ANAZO,"I didn't think I'd like this movie, but I did. The Women, starring Meg Ryan, Annette Bening, Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett was a very nice surprise, in large part due to a stellar performance by Annette Bening and a couple of great cameos by Candace Bergen, Carrie Fisher, and Debi Mazar. Eva Mendez was perfect for her role, as was Debra Messing, and if I hadn't gotten distracted by Meg Ryan's overblown hair and lips, I'd give it a solid five stars. :-) As it is, I give it four stars and a solid thumbs up.

A woman's three best friends find out that her husband is being unfaithful - do they tell her? Sure they do, but not before seeing for themselves that the poor schmuck never stood a chance against a hot tamale like Eva, the perfume girl at Saks. Guided by her mother's advice, Meg decides to let her husband have his little fling, knowing he'll get tired of his spicy and demanding chica pretty quickly. He does, and she thinks she's won, until she finds out the affair is still going on. This is a great story about the power of girlfriends, the power of women, and the power of forgiveness.

Wronged wife Meg Ryan copes with the breakup of her marriage with advice from her friends and her mother, and in the process is transformed from a messy haired mess, submerged in nameless Mom-dom, into what she always wanted to be all along. a chic, gorgeous fashion designer who wows the world with her first collection. (This is the only part of the script that bothered me. It was a bit much, just like Meg's hair and lips.) Anyway, this transformation doesn't happen overnight, and along the way, Annette Bening's character absolutely shines as the best friend, who, in a moment of career panic, agrees to publish the messy details of her best friend's divorce. The schmuck is a muckety-muck on Wall Street, you see, and well... sex sells.

The breakup between the best friends is even worse than the breakup of Meg's marriage. It's no coincidence that the name of this movie is ""The Women"", because that's what the movie is all about - relationships between women (the breakup of Meg's marriage is basically a side plot). Annette begs for forgiveness, but Meg cuts her off, just like she has her husband. Annette continues to be a friend behind Meg's back by helping her adolescent daughter cope with her parent's impending divorce. They eventually (of course) get back to being best friends in a great scene where they fight, hug, fight some more, and then do some more hugging. Just like real women. :-)

Meanwhile, the poor schmuck of a husband is always in the wings (though we never meet him). Once he knew he was busted, he broke things off with Eva, and seems truly contrite. He's pining for his wife back, begging for a second chance to get to know the ""new"" Meg.

Ultimately, just like she gave her friend Annette Bening a second chance at friendship, Meg gives her husband a second chance in their marriage. They're two different people now and we, as viewers, are supposed to believe that this couple is going to live happily ever after, despite his infidelity. Meg is no longer the mousy little mom who was willing to put up with an affair, and her husband has learned that the grass isn't always greener on the other side of the fence.

I'd say that the lesson of this movie was that we have to love ourselves before other people can love us. That if we love people, we forgive them, even if they've hurt us badly. Definitely a great chick flick movie (I enjoyed it much more than I did the last Sex In The City), and (shhh....don't tell anybody) but my husband actually enjoyed it, too.",1229817600,5,3612,4.523736600306279

3403993,1,B0017ANAZO,"The Women (2008) by Diane English is sadly such a waste of talent. With Annette Benning, Candice Bergen, Bette Midler, Cloris Leachman whom I like and enjoy in everything I've seen them, and Meg Ryan, Jada Pinkett Smith, Debra Messing, and Eva Mendes who may not be my favorite actors but are nice to look at, how could the movie be boring, predictable, embarrassing, sloppy, and simply bad? It was made by Diane English who is known as the writer of the very successful TV show Murphy Brown, and it is her first movie for which she wrote a script. The movie has been a labor of love for English who had tried for many years to make it happen and I respect that. I even found the scenes with the supporting players, Bergen, Leechaman, Carry Fisher and Bette Middler in short but memorable cameos, funny, smart, and enjoyable but in general the movie is a second hand ""Sex and the City"" which was released few months ago. I did not find Sex and the City very good when I saw it but next to The Women, it was simply brilliant. At least, Sex and the City spared us the long and tasteless scene in the hospital's delivery room where one of the characters' was having a baby and her friends were there supporting her. Poor Debra Messing, what did she do to deserve that nightmare she was put through and we, the viewers together with her? The movies like ""The Women"" give the whole genre, chick flicks, a bad name. It is nothing wrong with the genre, but why is it so difficult to make a really good comedy about female friendships and hardships, about dealing with marriage, motherhood, and proving yourself professionally? These are all very compelling and important subjects any modern woman can relate to. Why making movies with the lines, dialogs, and situations so clichd, predictable, not funny and insulting that they will be forgotten as soon as the movie is over?

After I saw the new movie, I checked out from my local library the original The Women and I truly enjoyed it. The story was told much better 70 years ago, and kept my interest all the way. The old movie had a real star power.

1.5/5",1222300800,9,2102,4.485639686684073
3403994,4,B0017ANAZO,"""The Women"" is the film ""Sex and the City"" wishes it was. There are some distinct similarities: both are about a group of female friends living in New York; both feature quirky main characters; both tackle relationship and fidelity issues; both look at life through a very witty filter (mostly to a fault). But ""The Women"" is the superior film, and that's only partly because of its much more tolerable sense of humor; the characters in this film are examined maturely, allowing us to see them as more than shallow, artificial caricatures. I actually felt something for these women. I cared about them and wondered what would happen to them. While not faithful to either George Cukor's 1939 film or the original play by Clare Boothe Luce, this new film is a delight from beginning to end, and it plays true to its title by not featuring a single male character.

The plot mainly focuses on fashion designer Mary Haines (Meg Ryan), who, in addition to being fired by her own father, discovers that her well-known husband, Stephen, is having an affair with Crystal Allen (Eva Mendes), a perfume saleswoman from Saks Fifth Avenue. Standing by Mary is her best friend, magazine editor Sylvia Fowler (Annette Benning), who had already heard about the affair through a gossipy manicurist (Debi Mazar). Sylvia, as it turns out, is having problems of her own; her magazine isn't selling as well as it used to, meaning she's inches away from being fired. Desperate to keep her career alive, she sells Mary's high-profile story to a tabloid writer (a cameo by Carrie Fisher), which, as you might expect, threatens to destroy their friendship. She's no longer sure she can trust anyone, and this includes her other two friends, writer Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett Smith), and the ever-pregnant Edie Cohen (Debra Messing).

Would this story be better or worse if male characters were included? Chances are it would be worse, simply because male/female relationship stories are a dime a dozen. What makes ""The Women"" unique is that it forces the main character to analyze her situation from an entirely feminine perspective. A man--be it her husband, a friend, a brother, or even a stranger--is not there to influence her one way or another. Think about all the recent romantic comedies in which the male leads inevitably profess their undying love for the female co-stars: every scene like that is always so contrived, so out of touch with anything realistic or even plausible. No such scene exists in ""The Women."" Through the support of her friends, the wisdom of her mother (Candice Bergen), the loyalty of her housekeeper (Cloris Leachman), and an awful lot of soul searching, Mary has to determine on her own whether or not she wants to take her husband back. The question is: Does he want to be taken back? Is he still in love with her, or has he moved on?

An interesting subplot focuses on the relationship between Mary and her eleven-year-old daughter, Molly (India Ennenga), who often feels unheard and misunderstood. She doesn't appreciate her mother's meaningless assertions that everything will be all right. Clearly, it won't be. She misses the love her parents shared, a love that always put an extra bounce in her mother's step. And like many young girls growing up in Western society, she believes she fat (even though she's anything but). Mary, consumed with her own problems, fails to notice the warning signs her daughter is giving off. So imagine her surprise when she learns that Molly is turning to Sylvia for advice--Sylvia, a childless woman who threw her best friend to the wolves. The confrontation between her and Mary is an interesting scene, not only because it's heartfelt and humorous at the same time, but also because of the way it's constructed; they defend themselves at the start, but by the end, one knows exactly where the other is coming from. If only all disagreements could end that way.

On a women's retreat, Mary meets an agent named Leah Miller (another cameo by Better Midler). As they share a joint in their cabin, Leah reveals her secret to living life: Be selfish. Don't care about what others want. The sooner you ask, ""What do I want?"" the sooner you'll be content. I can't say whether or not Mary takes this idea to heart, given how she really feels about her husband. What I can say is that the women of ""Sex and the City"" followed it to a tee. Rarely have I seen characters so shallow, so annoying, so lacking in redeeming qualities.

Thank goodness ""The Women"" goes in a much different direction. The pleasure of watching this movie comes from knowing that writer/director Diane English added depth to the characters. Granted, some were given more attention than others; Jada Pinkett Smith and Debra Messing weren't given much screen time, which is disappointing considering the narrative potential of their characters. This is especially true of Messing's character, the eccentric Edie, who announces early on that she'll keep getting pregnant until she has a boy (she already has three daughters). Wouldn't it be fun if she were the best friend instead of Sylvia? Or what about Smith's character, Alex, made openly gay for this modernized version? Both characters come dangerously close to being extraneous. Maybe it would have been better if the story focused on two friends instead of four. Be that as it may, ""The Women"" is a charming, well-acted, well-plotted film--about the most fun you'll have in a male-free environment.",1221264000,38,5470,4.8964401294498385

I was slightly dragged into it by an aunt and about five minutes into the movie, decided I really loved it. For 1939 it was forward thinking and quite funny. While some reviewers may not have liked Jada Pinkett-Smith (in particular her lesbian character), I personally enjoyed her character, and yes I am.... and yes, I've met many who are a lot like this character.
 I think the point of all these characters is a reminder that not all women are cookie cutter stereotypes of any class of women, we are all unique.
As for this 2008 version of a sleepy classic; had I not seen the original I most likely still would have given it three stars. There were definitely awkward moments that felt forced by the actresses. The butter, cocoa and milk scene automatically lost them a star. That was just disgusting.  I also missed several things from the original that I would have liked to have seen then either expand upon or tackle for this century. For example, the divorce dude ranch from the original with the Countess. I loved that role from the 1939 version and I love Bette Midler for this role, it makes sense, but she had a smaller part than Mary Bowland did in the original. That character was great.
I also liked that Crystal Allen was seeing someone else in the original after she had stolen Mary Haine's husband away and eventually found he had no money at all since it belonged to the Countess. Joan Crawford's character got exactly what she deserved in 1939, but Eva Mendes' version really didn't seem to.  And while she is very lovely to look at, well Crawford's Allen character was far nastier, vile and despicable and much better acted.
So overall, three stars mostly for love of the original and the ladies who star in it.  As someone said earlier, it really is a good lazy day or rainy day kind of movie and WILL provide you with a few hearty laughs.",1503619200,,1969,4.569405099150142

3404017,3,B0017ANAZO,"Yes, Meg Ryan was not great in this film, but she never was outstanding as an actress.  She's better for comedy than drama, and this film was more of a drama than a comedy, though it had its comedic elements.  Annette Benning was amazing as always, but the spectacular part was that this movie was truly groundbreaking in that no men were shown on camera, even in the crowd scenes.  Other than the male baby at the end, this film was comprised entirely of women actors.  What a feat!  No film in recent history has ever done that.  (I'm not sure if that was done in the 1930's version of this film.)  In fact, I hadn't even noticed the all female characters until I read that in a summary of the movie.  While the film itself was a triumph for women, unfortunately, the overall message in it was not.  The point seemed to be, find inner strength to tolerate your cheating husband, which was a huge let down.  Overall, the movie gets an A for effort, and a D for outcome.",1499644800,,970,4.30939226519337

I have the original 1939 version as well and the underlying story is the same, the overall effect has been brought forward to the 21st century. I honestly feel that you can't  fully appreciate the modern version without seeing the original version. As a standalone, it is cute-at-best film but when placed side-by-side with the original the underlying flow is fully experienced and the 'same stuff, different era' appeal shines through. Overall, I liked this, I really like this.

The 1930s film was interesting so I figured with this cast it should be good, but its not. Seems like an ""I hate men"" a lot through-out as well as ,""my friends are more important than my husband"".
Plus the acting was pretty slow which I assume is due to director.
Its a shame because this and real potential .
Oh and the woman who is suppose to be the hero of the story, gets her money to file her ambition from mommy. So rich married woman who has worked for daddy most of her life, decides to become a fashion designer and mommy pays for it...Basically a woman can't do it truly on her own.

During the initial third of the movie it is rather hard to follow characters and identify relationships.  The plot is finally drawn together by Meg Ryan's marital problems and her best friend's misfortunes as well. The underlying thesis of staying in an adulterous marriage as discussed by Meg and several other characters seems flawed and unrealistic, especially for Meg who confesses to ""cheating once"". . . . moving her top hat figure more than the rolled number of spaces during a childhood Monopoly game!

Meg Ryan plays the role perfectly plus never for one moment does she act like a victim. She is a strong, smart person who does not allow anyone, friend or family to be a negative influence on her chosen path. Not surprisingly, Meg's character prevails and in the end she has everything she needs or wants including her group of friends which accounts for most of the rest of the cast.

3404233,3,B0017ANAZO,"The Women was a stellar film in the 1930s with a solid cast featuring Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, and Joan Fontaine among a gaggle of other beauties and stars of their time. The script was comedic genius and the acting aces. Unfortunately the remake was a huge letdown with poor pacing and too many moments when the actors appeared uncomfortable in their own skin. Eva Mendes filled Joan Crawford's shoes and while her sexual allure is indisputable she did not have the sophistication and elegance that Joan Crawford brought to the role and her scenes were cut short in comparison. Meg Ryan seemed an odd casting choice especially since this was post-botax and Debra Messing seemed to be trying too hard. The Dennie Moore scene from the 1930s film is well created by Debi Mazar. I should have known the film would be a loser the moment Meg Ryan's character chooses not to accept the Jungle Red nail polish. In this day and age it seemed as if the feminist progressive views from 1939 were being doused with water and that is not a good way to start a movie. Enjoy the fun cameos and the cute opening scene with Annette Bening but don't throw away your copy of the 1930s classic.",1423872000,9,1180,4.570754716981132

I can honestly say the acting of this movie was on the low quality side.  it did not elicit any emotion from me. Usually any movie I watch elicits some kind of emotions, but I didn't feel anything and I wanted to turn off the movie in the first 10 minutes, but decided to give it a try anyway and ended up wasting my time and my money.

3404289,5,B0017ANAZO,"Ths is SUCH a good, funny movie with wonderfully funny actresses, from Meg Ryan to India Ennenga, who plays her daughter. It's a sad, unfair situation too many women have had to deal with. Rich or poor, wives being left for another woman, it's difficult and devastating. This group of ladies display the good intentions and human weaknesses in trying to support Ryan's character. Cloris Leachman is always hilariously stone-faced, teaching Tilly Scott Pedersen the pitfalls of getting emotionally involved w/your employer's issues. Eva Mendes is perfect as the all too confident other woman who finds her 'game on' position can be upended before she can do anything. This was truly a sad situation story played out with funny reality-based elements only women can provide. It's just a wonderfully entertaining film for us ladies. Get out the popcorn and enjoy.",1415059200,,860,5.15
3404290,4,B0017ANAZO,"It's nice to see a film that tells a woman's story that doesn't drop into caricatures and extremes. It almost happens, and I thought it was going to happen a couple of times, but the director did a fine job of ""keeping' it real"" and not making the whole thing laughable.

Each of the actresses was well-chosen for her part:
* I'm not a fan of Meg Ryan, but she did well here. (I really wanted to see her get a couple of barrettes for her hair, so she would get it out of her face.)
* Jada P-Smith did an excellent job. She wasn't insecure in the role, and so played a great second-level character that fit so well into the story. I really liked her in the delivery room.
* Annette Bening brought just the right level of haughtiness to her well-played character without overplaying her.
*Debra Messing was very not-Grace and handled the chaos of motherhood with grace. I'm not a fan of delivery-room screaming and yelling, but it added to the story.
* Eva Mendez played the hussie role very well and with a level of calculation that gave her depth - somewhat skewed in her sense of morals, but not to the extreme.

*SPOILER ALERT*
The only contradiction in the story - maybe even hypocrisy - was that the pregnant character of Debra Messing's had several girls (4? 5? 3?) but she was going to continue to pop them out until she had a boy. After the whole film told the story of the women's strength, their independence, their bond as friends being different than men's friendships - only having a boy-child was the ultimate achievement. Disappointing.",1414368000,,1550,4.49290780141844

Every retelling of a story should be better than the first, but this one was lacked a certain magic. And speaking of magic, they could have done a better job casting the women. On they're own Meg Ryan, Annette Bening and Debra Messing are fantastic. Together they lacked chemistry, and a lot of the acting felt forced.

3404337,1,B0017ANAZO,"Need it be said, I hated this movie. I hated everything about it. If you've read through all the other bad reviews to find this one, than you already know about the mediocre performances, the bad performances, the truly painful performances, and Meg Ryan's self-mutilations--uh, I mean--her latest cosmetic surgery. You also know about the horrible script and boring, nonsensical dialogue. And you probably know that this is a remake of a famous classic from 1939. What hasn't been discussed is WHY this movie went so terribly wrong.
The answer in my opinion rests squarely with Diane English, the butcher of this script. The original film, based on a play of the same name, was about a group of New York's ultra-rich, spoiled, self-obsessed, bitchy socialites getting embroiled in a no-holds-barred cat-fight over a man. It's a fun, sophisticated (for it's time) and hilarious film that still somehow  manages to be sympathetic to its characters. Cue Diane English, who had the brilliant (not!) idea of taking this script and turning into a warm and fuzzy tale of female empowerment-ala-Sex and the City. Presto! The bitchy socialites become successful modern career women (well, some of them anyway) who stick together and support each other when one of their clique is wronged by her husband and the ""other"" woman. And it might have worked, but English either lacked the skill or the confidence to depart from the original script and instead tried to marry it to her modern vision. The result is this infamous train wreck of a film in which everybody looks bad, and sound worse. Nobody is convincing in their roles, or even seems to understand their roles, and whatever 'message' English was trying to send gets buried in the confusion.",1398816000,4,1739,4.975945017182131

Trying to shoe-horn modern mores, attitudes and behaviors into am 80-year-old play is silly and makes a very big mess.

I saw the 1939 and 2008 movies almost back-to-back and was entertained by both.  I highly urge folks to get this and watch it.  It is the only movie I have ever seen that stars only women--they all deserved academy awards for this!",1379203200,,512,4.440860215053763
3404372,5,B0017ANAZO,"This is not a chick flick, it is a feminist movie (which makes it even better). There were so many facets relating to sexism & women's expected roles that were handled with a few succinct lines of dialogue (these few were the first to be remembered).
""This is my face, deal with it.""

""Since when are you counting calories?""
- ""Since I'm fat."" said by the stick thin 11 year old character

""Why don't they show normal women in magazines?""

""I'm a person, not an accessory.""

""Well, what does she have to be angry about?""
- ""She's hungry."" about a super model who is later seen eating a napkin.

""There are no 60 year old women, I'm the last one.""

""It's time to stop talking down to our readers."" about the direction a women's magazine should take.

Filled with these enlightening bon mots, this movie attempts to scale the anti feminist mountain of propaganda. Woman are not cardboard cut outs with black & white answers, we are complex & messy & capable of growing as this fabulous movie so aptly represents.",1377907200,,1010,4.54696132596685

However, I enjoyed it because it dealt with issues that I actually might think about: divorce, losing a dream job, ups and downs with my women friends. What a relief to see a movie that wasn't obsessed with getting the dream guy and living happily ever after. If you are into those issues, you'll like this movie. It's funny, it slaps on the happy ending, but it's also covers topics that are real and isn't focused only on The Man (although a husband having an affair is certainly a central theme). The cast is amazing and I loved the interactions between the women. Enjoy!

I should add, that despite all those topics, it is certainly a comedy.",1369872000,,800,4.333333333333333

3404408,2,B0017ANAZO,"Meg Ryan plays a wealthy New Yorker whose world is upended when her husband has an affair with a girl who works at a perfume counter (played by Eva Mendes).  How Meg's character and her character's friends learn of her husband's infidelity, and how they help their friend face this problem is fairly entertaining.  Unfortunately for the movie goer, however, Ryan is soon able to realize that she only needs to change the focus of her life from pleasing others to pleasing herself--whereupon she instantly achieves meteoric professional and personal success!  The moral would seem to be that all good things come effortlessly to those who are both rich and lucky!

I should also observe that an interesting aspect of this movie is that no man is ever seen onscreen--nor is his voice even heard over the phone!  This device, although somewhat novel, probably limits the dramatic possibilities--as well as limiting the development of the principal male character: the husband of Meg Ryan's character!",1364601600,,997,5.054878048780488

3404413,4,B0017ANAZO,"I was stuck in a hotel in bad weather and this came on the television.  I thought it was fun.  I had no idea it is a remake of a movie from the 1930s.  I don't even have television at home, so watching in a hotel room in England was just passing the time.  This movie kept my interest.  I thought the cast was delightful and the underlying story of friendship was a good one.
I am always fascinated by movie/TV characters who seem to not have one iota of financial distress, but lots of personal unhappiness
It was not until the next day that I realized that there was not one man to be seen in the entire movie!! All of the crowd scenes were women only; even Mary's dog  was a female, and all of the children girls. Except that baby at the end... one can only guess!
This is not deep or a masterpiece, but a good comedy, though there is nothing funny about infidelity.
I liked it and recommend it",1359504000,5,897,4.126436781609195
3404414,3,B0017ANAZO,"This is a ""chick flik"" in every sense of the word.

Ladies, don't expect your boyfriend to sit through this. He won't.

Actually, I'm glad I didn't review this on a prior occasion. I would have panned it, which would have been unfair. After seeing it a second time, I realize that it's a better movie than I remember. Diane English has tried to make Clare Booth Luce's mid-1930's Broadway Play relevant to the 21st Century and that is just an impossible task.

Ms. Luce wrote the play during a period when her husband was positioned in New York City. She was writing about the spoiled, self-centered, catty, gossipy society dames she had come to know and, of whom, she obviuously disapproved. This type of woman no longer exists unless you count people like Paris Hilton and Tinsley Mortimer and, who cares about them anyway? In the 1930's, this type of women were celebrities with reputations to uphold.

Here's what's missing:

Sidney's (Elizabeth Arden's)
The Train to Reno. (We fly now).
Miriam Aarons. (absorbed into Crystal Allen who has become a Soap Opera  Actress).
The Dude Ranch (Replaced by a Health Spa).
Lucy (absorbed into Cloris Leachman's maid).
Buck Winston.
Peggy (the naive newlywed).
The Starlight Room.
The re-union with Steven.

These women all work. They all like one another. The cat fight has now been reduced to an argument on a street corner.

Sylvia Fowler is now a nice woman played by Annette Bening who is too old for the part.

Meg Ryan is gorgeous, but, you knew that.

Eva Mendes is spectacular looking! What man wouldn't run after her?

Candace Bergen recycles Murphy Brown.

Cloris Leachman is good as always but she has nothing funny to say.

Debra Messing is funny and plays not too bright but she's not as stupid or as mean as Phyllis Povah was in the original movie.

Bette Midler, who would have been fabulous as the Countess has now become a predatory talent agent.

Where is the sniping, gossip, mud-slinging, back biting and hair-pulling?

This story is now PC and heartwarming. If that's what you want, here it is.

Mary's friends find out and try to find a way to tell Mary, but she already knows.  We watch Mary fall apart and then pull it all back together.

There's a part in the film where Mary has now gained her confidence back and she realizes that she wants to accomplish some things on her own merit.  She has renewed vigor about life.  Her mother asks her what brought about these changes.  Mary replies, ""Hitting bottom.  Having nothing else to lose.  I highly recommend it.""

3404462,1,B0017ANAZO,"**REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**

Mary Haine (Meg Ryan) finds out her husband is cheating on her and her thoughtful, caring friends offer their support.  At least, that's what the descriptions says.  Actually, it's just one long guilt trip.

First guilt tripper is her mother, who says if Mary divorces, it'll hurt her daughter.  To drive home that message, we see a sad-faced daughter moping around and blaming her mother for everything.  What's being ignored is Mary's right to protect her mental health as well as the father's role in hurting his daughter.  If he cared about his daughter's feelings, he wouldn't have put his marriage in jeopardy the way he did.

The person who lays it on real thick, though, is her supposed friend Edie (Debra Messing).  After Edie confesses to her own affair, she angrily tells Mary that her husband forgave her because he's a good man.  The clear message is that if Mary doesn't also forgive, then she's a bad person.  So much for moral support!

When her friends find out the husband is cheating, they withhold the truth from Mary, claiming to protect her.  But withholding the truth doesn't protect Mary.  It protects her husband who gets to avoid the negative consequences of his actions while continuing to have his cake and eat it, too.  Their silence also meant Mary found about the affair from a complete stranger instead of her own friends.

Another supposed friend is Sylvie (Annette Benning) who throws Mary under the bus to protect her own career.  Even her housekeeper only tries to preserve Mary's marriage, not for Mary's sake, but to save her own career.  Normally, I'd feel sorry for someone in Mary's shoes, but I couldn't because Mary is so spineless.

First, Mary blames her husband's mistress for the affair, believing the mistress came on so strong, the poor guy didn't stand a chance.  She then makes a fool of herself, demanding the mistress let her husband go, as if he's being held hostage.  She forgets her husband entered the affair freely and the only didn't leave because he's spineless, too.

In the end, Mary concludes that the reason her husband cheated was because she wasn't a whole person.  Now that she's supposedly whole, they can be together again.  However, her husband didn't cheat because of what Mary lacked.  He cheated because of what he lacked - good character.

These messages disturbed me because too often, the betrayed spouse gets unfairly blamed for adultery.  I also didn't like how glibly adultery is presented.  Although there's one scene where Mary cries over being cheated on, for the most part, she's not too affected by it.  Shortly after discovering her husband's adultery, she's even laughing and having a good time with her mom.

Besides the unfair guilt trips and glib portrayal of adultery, this movie also suffers from bad acting (especially the miscast Jada Pinkett-Smith).  Overall, this movie went from bad to worse.",1285804800,10,2918,4.9059304703476485

3404466,5,B0017ANAZO,"I have watched the original movie dozens of times, making it one of my favorite films. I thought this remake was excellent in its ability to adapt it to current lifestyles. As in both versions, one does not notice that there are no men in the film - and they are not missed! Meg Ryan was excellent as she was able to tone the overblown gestures and expressions used by Norma Shearer who never seemed to be able to distance herself from her old silent film days. (I always felt she got such juicy roles as this because she was married to MGM head Irving Thalberg. The 1939 film was over-budgeted, over-produced, and over-acted making for a campy movie to match Shearing's over-the-top style. Check out her version of ""Marie Antoinette"" [1938] - it so syrupy it'll give you diabetes!) Annette Bening's portrayal of Sylvia was superb as was Debra Messing. Eva Mendes totally captured the new millennium gold digger. Jada Pinkett Smith had the most difficult role as her character would have been the most scandalous and banned from the earlier film. These women were strong, intelligent, and independent in their own ways. Watching Meg Ryan come into her own was uplifting while Candace Bergen's revelations of a ""life unfulfulled"" was indicative of women of her era. All of the negative reviews here have no merit. This is well-written screenplay with an outstanding cast of women. Females watchers should learn to be open and supportive of a film with a female director and all female cast. Men can either take something positive from the film or not say anything negative at all since they obviously aren't able to understand the complex parts which make up a real woman of this time and this place.

There are very good people in this film and they all do a good job. There are lots of funny lines and the plot is good. Not a single guy in the film makes it cool too. It's different from the orginal yes, but it's still fun. I seen it 5 times already and it doesn't let up.",1272240000,,425,3.896551724137931
3404468,4,B0017ANAZO,"I discovered this film one day while I was flipping channels.  When it started I thought it seemed like it would be a short-half hour situation comedy.  But as it developed into a two-hour film I found myself very interested, especially when, about a quarter way into the story I realized that there was not one single man in the cast.

This is the story of women's friendships and the two main characters are played by Meg Ryan and Annette Bening.  Annette Bening is cast as a sophisticated career woman and in the first scene she goes for a manicure at Saks Fifth Avenue and hears the manicurist gossiping about Meg Ryan's husband who is having an affair with a girl who works at the perfume counter.  Annette tries to keep this information from her friend but eventually it comes out.  Meg Ryan looks beautiful in this role of a suburban housewife whose world seems to fall apart.  Candace Bergan is cast has her mother and her role is interesting too.

Soon, I got involved in the story.  The characters were a bit overdone but I definitely related to them.  And I loved the happy ending too.

Later, I discovered that this was a remake of a 1939 film which was supposed to be a real winner.  I never saw that film (but maybe I will someday) so I had nothing to compare this version to.  This might not be the greatest film in the world but not every film is destined for Academy Awards.  Some are just simply to enjoy.",1268524800,3,1423,4.402298850574713

The film started out okay--the dialogue was alright and the acting was fine, and I was amused by Annette Bening's character.  However, after about the first half, the film went nowhere.

It lacked the sharpness of the original and the famous line (""There's a word for women like that..."") was uttered within the first minute of the film and utterly wasted.",1268352000,5,623,4.618181818181818

We were both blown away by the great story lines and the quality of the acting.  The casting is right on, and each individual performance is excellent.  A brief scene in which Candace Bergen, a mother tells her daughter how it felt to be betrayed by an unfaithful husband was, in my opinion, worthy of an Academy Award best supporting nomination. I've always enjoyed her comedy, but this was a fine dramatic performance.  I can see that many have panned this film, and I cannot understand why.  It's a keeper.",1261526400,4,629,4.482456140350878

The only saving grace is that I came across it on cable and didn't wast time and additional money by renting it, buying it or trekking out to a theater to watch it.  Horrible movie.",1261094400,5,474,4.233333333333333
3404473,3,B0017ANAZO,"Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) is a successful housewife. Her busy schedule keeps her name on the lips of society and her daughter adores her, but it seems her husband is discontent. Steven Haines is having an affair with a perfume girl (Eva Mendes). Suddenly the gossip is out, and although her friends (Annette Benning, Debra Messing, Jada Pinkett Smith) try to help her deal with the pain of the situation, Mary decides to divorce her husband.

The movie starts strong. The dialogue is witty, the characters are energetic and interesting, and the plot moves along nicely. It is updated to modern times flawlessly, and these girls resemble the famous friends from Sex in the City.

Toward the end, however, the movie veers off into an alley of sentiment and turns into a full-on chic-flick. We see a woman become independent and powerful and achieve the dreams she never realized, made for audiences to shout ""You go, girl!"" in the background. Best friends have a fight and then cry together over their great relationship. It all culminates in a delivery room where women bond over the ability to have babies. Disgusting.

Still, this re-make is superior to that starring June Allyson and Joan Collins which is much less exciting in spite of how cheesy this one becomes.

It is always nice to see a great screen writer from the past appear in the credits of a film, even if it isn't a wonderful remake. However, it retains a lot of the great elements of the past. There are no men in his film, a gimmick ignored in the Allyson remake but a memorable part of the original.

3404487,3,B0017ANAZO,"Diane English picked up and rearranged the missing pieces of the romantic comedy genre, based on the multidimensional affective feminine universe. But smartly she focuses her whole attention around seven well defined characters; the first three are of course Meg Ryan as the devoted wife always trying to shine as human being. But living into a happy bubble (living in a beautiful home at Connecticut, married with a successful executive and supported by her best friend (Annette Bening) - the second main character - she will have to have to face the world when she hits the bottom at the moment she realizes her husband cheats her with the alluring Eva Mendes. The third main character is her mother (the lovable and still beautiful Candice Bergen) who will support her according her particular style, and finally we have Ryan's daughter a girl who's living the hard transition of the adolescence (with its doubts and fears)  . But the other three secondary roles turn around Eva Mendes the seductive lover of Stephen Haines, (who looks fine in this role); the pregnant friend (who expects this birth with hope and illusion) and the lesbian character (who lives with a super model).

New York is the big stage, the fashion world and its well known dissonances rounds an entire and passable film with a happy ending when the different destinies of these women intersect themselves.

Curiously there's no single shot with a masculine character all the way through. We just listen far references (as the telephone call with Ryan's husband).

A very well written script makes of this movie a pleasant and enriching experience for making us think.

It's not only the lack of any actor with a Y chromosome that makes The Women feel like it should be airing on the Lifetime network: between the ham-handed direction, weak writing, and superfluity of characters in a short film, The Women is a featherlight comedy that might be the type of film to watch on an airplane but that's about the best recommendation I can muster.

3404492,3,B0017ANAZO,"""The Women"" was a dollar rental from that trusty RedBox that our grocery stores around here have.  What a relief!  The story is centered around Meg Ryan's character- who finds out that her loving and doting husband is cheating on her.  Meg Ryan and her beautiful hair and angelic face- cheating on HER?  Meg has a band of girlfriends including gruff and streetwise Jada Pinkett-Smith, goofy Debra Messing and smart and sophisticated Annette Benning.  So, where does that leave the other famous actress on the cover?  Eva Mendes is the mistress.  Of course.  With those curves and that mouth... Fine, I can see why.

But!  Meg Ryan's girls flock around her and push her to do the dirty work that she is usually too feeble to do.  She screams and swears and gets her nails done!  Meg Ryan has always been a little aloof in her movies, but I'd be okay to admit that this movie is one of her finer performances.  I think between her and Annette Benning, I'm hard pressed who made this film the measely 3 stars that it is.  Without them, the whole thing would have been a disaster.

The story is overdone and we've seen all angles of this thing, but... I was willing to watch someone do it one more time.  ""The Women"" didn't show me anything new.  Nothing surprised me.  Meg Ryan did a stellar performance of being the doting and happy wife, to the angry and depressed, yet ANGRY adulteree (is that a word?).  I enjoyed watching her transformation.

The director did not use Debra Messing's natural ability to entertain, make jokes (yes), but also to offer insight.  I usually enjoy Messing's work, but this one just left me thinking she is entirely too quirky and had no serious moments in the entire movie.  Jada Pinkett-Smith, I'll admit, I haven't seen her in many movies, but this one was overacted and I couldn't wait for her to get off the screen.  Obviously she isn't a street person in real life, but I am not supposed to know that, as the viewer.  Not a good performance at all.  The few times that Eva Mendes was on screen, she seemed surly and pouting, and at times bitchy- but rarely did I see her account for her actions- especially when Meg Ryan actually confronts her.  Eva is hardly in the movie at all, which for this particular film, is a blessing.  She would have only botched it up more.

This gets a three stars.  If Meg Ryan and Annette Benning hadn't done such a great job, it would have gotten a two stars for the script writing and the others overacting.  It was bearable, but not something I will probably ever watch again.",1254960000,2,2545,4.493449781659389
3404493,4,B0017ANAZO,"Sure, women can have it all these days.  But the question posed by Diane English in her 2008 update on THE WOMEN is: do they really want it all?

If anyone was going to create a modern-day spin on Clare Boothe Luce's catty 1930's Broadway play, THE WOMEN (made famous in the 1939 MGM movie starring Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford), it was ""Murphy Brown"" scribe Diane English.  While time has rolled on, the problems concerning women certainly haven't.

When down-to-earth Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) discovers that her husband has taken on a seductive perfume counter clerk named Crystal Allen (Eva Mendes) as his mistress, she paints her nails jungle-red and reinvents herself as a boutique fashion designer - but not without some support from her faithful gal-pals including magazine editor Sylvie (Annette Bening), ""serial mother"" Edie (Debra Messing) and outspoken lesbian author Alex (Jada Pinkett Smith).

As in the original, no man ever appears on screen, and Ms English has wisely retained many of the best lines from the source material (there's also a clever black-and-white twist on the original's Technicolor fashion show sequence!) .  While a lot of what English newly creates for the remake might seem fresh and cutting edge - ie: Mary's eleven-year-old daughter (India Ennenga) who starts smoking to suppress her appetite - I think she's tried too hard to cram in as many modern elements as possible, making the film seem overstuffed with information.  The crux of the story remains Mary's reinvention, and Meg Ryan portrays that nicely.  And I appreciate the fact that, unlike the original in which we see Norma Shearer (as Mary) tearfully running back into her husband's arms; the question of whether Mary will in fact return to her marriage is left up to the audience.

Fantastic performances all-round, particularly from Messing, Bening and Pinkett Smith as the main trio; Cloris Leachman is the Haines housekeeper and has some great scenes, and no Diane English film would be complete without ""Murphy Brown"" herself, Candice Bergen, who plays Mary's mother.  Bette Midler has an all-too-brief bit as a burnt-out, multiple-divorced Hollywood agent.  There are also appearances from Joanna Gleason, Carrie Fisher and Ana Gasteyer.",1252281600,2,2244,5.15426997245179

The actors, though generally outstanding in other vehicles, just weren't good in this endeavor. The acting was noticeably bad. The only standouts for me were Cloris Leachman and Debra Messing at the end. She was hilarious to me. In fact, her character seemed to have the only real honest reactions in the whole movie. I did enjoy the beautiful scenery and fabulous fashions.  I also actually liked the soundtrack which I'm going to check out further. Bottom line?

3404495,1,B0017ANAZO,"When Hollywood remakes a classic, it does so with a vengeance, in this case 1939s ""The Women"", a tale of New York socialite Mary Haines (Norma Shearer in 1939, Meg Ryan in 2008) whose husband is stolen by an opportunistic hussy. In the original, a careless gossip reveals a scandalous affair, a girl from the wrong side of the tracks poaching the man of a beloved, gentle woman and faithful wife. Like the current remake, no one suffers financial distress in either film. Where such movies served to distract a country burdened by the long years of the Depression, the 2008 version is nothing but a paean to Sex and the City and its ilk.

The crisp, acerbic dialog that fed the drama of a heartless housebreaker determined to secure her future in 1939 has been watered down to support vague cameo appearances, but the context is lost in a twisted mess of improbable solutions and sloppy writing. When Mary Haines gathers with ladies in similar situations getting ""quickie"" divorces in Reno 1939, the modern group goes to a health farm, where Ryan smokes a joint with Bette Midler and ruminates on where she's gone wrong. While the first film offered fresh faces destined for long term stardom, Eve Arden, Paulette Goddard, Rosalind Russell and Joan Crawford, the new one is a rogue's gallery of cosmetically altered actresses, some more gruesome than others.

Meg Ryan- sporting a mouth that is part Meg, part Calista Flockhart and part Michelle Pheiffer- sullies Shearer's former role with braggadocio about her performance in the bedroom (something about nails and boards) and a hapless Annette Benning apologizes for exposing her friend to the rabid tabloid gossip. Bette Midler makes a bold, if shocking cameo, as though she stumbled onto the wrong set. And what could be more absurd than casting Crawford's iconic role with the sultry Eva Mendes (the extent of her role is a few lines delivered in sexy lingerie or in a bath tub)? Sadly, the coming to self of a married woman still in love with an unfaithful husband becomes Ryan's tongue-in-cheek parody of a new identity, complete with Annie Lennox anthem in the background.

For all the wasted efforts of such greats as Candice Bergin and Cloris Leachman, there are a few stellar moments: 5 stars to Annette Benning for a performance that transcends the vapid material, a short, but punchy role by Debi Mazar, the gossipy nail lady who spreads the rumors and a terrific one-liner by natural comedic actress Ana Gasteyer. In contrast, Jada Pinkett-Smith is a brash lesbian, Debra Messing's considerable talent is wasted, and Carrie Fisher? Well, she's just... Carrie Fisher.

An iconic comedy of manners and the danger of gossip is turned into a frivolous chick flick in an effort that does no justice to the sophistication of the original in this uncomfortable ensemble piece. It says something about the state of filmmaking for actresses over forty when all the public is offered is this warmed up hash with neither plot nor substance, a sad commentary when talented actresses are forced to alter their faces to remain relevant in a youth-obsessed society. Shame on Hollywood- and the screenwriter, producers and director- for presenting these actresses with such substandard fare. Luan Gaines/2009.",1248566400,30,3258,4.972477064220183
3404496,1,B0017ANAZO,"I seriously don't get movies like these.

It's a storyline that's *completely* pointless.  The constant talking going on between the women playing the lead characters doesn't MEAN anything.  The focal point of the storyline is something so ordinary and bland that it doesn't mean anything.

It doesn't matter if it's men or women- when the lead characters constantly talk about subjects that mean absolutely nothing to anyone except themselves, the film can't be saved, and there's honestly nothing even remotely interesting about ordinary every day city problems involving people in relationships and other minor things.

Imagine this- you go to the mall, hear a couple of men or women having conversations about their family and friends, and then follow them around the mall as they continue talking about their minor problems.  That's basically what happens throughout The Women.  The only difference is that, instead of a mall, it's all over a city.

Who in the world thought this was a good idea for a storyline?  And good enough to make a MOVIE out of it?  Don't make me laugh!

And although Debra Messing came very close to having that same comedic timing that the '39 cast showed - the 2008 version just doesn't stand up next to the 1939 - nor will it stand the test of time.

The movie is funny, even though the main character Mary is dealing with the issue of infidelity. The movie is inspiring in the fun women-movie way in which you watch another woman recapture her dreams after being crushed. Mary is a cute, fun person who has put her whole life on hold building the perfect marriage, home, and raising a daughter. All too often women do this. It takes her marriage falling apart to realize this.
The acting by Eva Mendez,and Jada Pinkett Smith was not great, and I love both of those ladies. I think this is Meg Ryan in one of her finest roles. She is so believable in the role of Mary. Debra Messing also does a great job as Edie the hippie mother. Anette Benning is the sharp, quick witted best friend. I think it's a fun movie for women to watch.",1246924800,,898,4.319526627218935

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Count the stars - Meg Ryan (Mary), Annette Bening (Mary's best friend Sylvia), Debra Messing (Mary's permanently pregnant friend Edie), Jada Pinkett-Smith (Mary's gay writer pal Alex), Candice Bergen (Mary's Mom), Bette Midler, Carrie Fisher, Cloris Leachman, Debi Mazar, and (ta-dah) Eva Mendes as ""the spritzer girl"" Crystal.
2. All star cast proves that too many chicks spoil the broth.
3. Main characters Mary and Sylvia dominate a ho-hum girlfriend drama that could have been so much more with the addition of humor and some good old fashioned beyotchiness.
4. All the other actresses are criminally underutilized
5. Back to the story (what little there is) - birds of a feather flock together when a cuckoo moves in on Mary's nest.
6. That's one heckuva sexy cuckoo
7. ... and one heckuva messy nest

The problem here is believability.  Quite simply, it's not.

Recommended for a bonding afternoon with the girls over ice cream and chocolate cake, and better yet, ditch the movie after the Saks underwear scene and get your nails done instead.

3404526,1,B0017ANAZO,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the original 1930s version of this movie so when I found out that there would be a modernized version, I was very excited to see it.

In case you haven't seen the original, it's about a woman who's living the fabulous life but finds out her ""loving"" husband is cheating on her with a perfume girl at ""Blacks.""  Her friends find out about it before she does (from a mancurist of all people) and they debate whether or not to tell her.  Mary (the one with the no-good, frog-faced, rougish, rat fink dog of a husband) finds out herself from the same mancurist and her Mom's advices her on what to do.  Mom suggests that she does nothing b/c if the husband really loved the girl, Mary would have felt it long ago and if she gets her friends involved then she'll just have another thing that she'll have to deal with.

Mary finally confronts the other woman (Crystal) that's creeping around with her husband in a dressing room.  After Crystal obviously has no remorse about what she's doing, Mary confronts Steven (the rat) and says she wants a divorce.

She gets the divorce in Reno but realizes too late that neither of them really want the divorce.  Steven feels that it is his duty to marry Crystal to protect what was left of her reputation.  (Yeah, I know, but men were a bit more chivalrous back then, which is pretty cool b/c nowadays some men leave ya with nothing more than a a kick in the teeth).

Over a year passes and Mary still loves Steven and by now Steven can't stand Crystal.  Mary finds out that Crystal is cheating on Steven and devises a way to expose Crystal and get Steven back.  She does, the end.

Fast forward to 2008 and what happens?!  A total disappointment!!  Okay, that wasn't completely accurate.  On its own I give it 1 1/4 out of 5 stars b/c the movie provide a few chuckles but as a modern day adaptation 1 1/2 and that's only because they did stay true to the plot for the most part.  I also give it props b/c it dealt with issues that women face today like the influence of the media on women's body images.  Good show for that.  But, even though it kept your attention (for me, it was mostly out of pure curiosity), it wasn't the laugh fest that I thought it would be.  Also, they wrote out my favorite character (Miriam Aarons) so it was all over for me.

3404530,2,B0017ANAZO,"AARP proudly presents.... (just kidding)

Anyway, I like female oriented films. And I definitely love Eva Mendes. But, all the other women of this film were really too old to me to be able to embrace as an enjoyable film about women. Even Meg Ryan has lost her appeal to me and yet she is younger than me. I've always thought Jada Pinkett Smith was hot, but in this film, playing a bad-tempered lesbian kinda put me off. I've never understood the appeal of Debra Messing even when she was younger, and I've seen Annette Benning in a few films, either mature themed (The American President), or just in bad taste (American Beauty), so seeing her again (and older), just didn't capture my appeal very well. We never did see Meg Ryan's husband in this film. So, since no character development of him could be established, I guess it's easy to just make him the ""bad guy"" in this failing marriage. Meg Ryan even showed that she was too busy to help her own daughter with a school project so I had no pity for her role even if her husband did find a young hottie (like Eva Mendes) to fulfill the emptiness in his life. A neglected husband (or even a neglected wife) can easily stray towards someone who also needs some temporary affection. And, if a man's got money, there's no reason to resist temptation. I've heard it said: ""A man is only as loyal as his options.""

For the age of these women who make up the star cast, even Bette Midler, Carrie Fisher, and Candice Bergen aren't all that much older than the main cast. If they needed an older woman in here for some kind of elderly influence, they really needed to seek out a silver screen dinosaur. That's where we get Cloris Leachman. For all we know, she could have been in the original 1939 version.

This movie's appeal is right there between ""Designing Women"" and ""The Golden Girls"". Anyway, I saw it, and I wasn't too impressed, probably because I'm still too young to relate to any of these women's problems. They were all rather old, cold, and shallow. Of these women, what man could possibly be proud to say: ""This is my wife!"" ? Not me. I couldn't care about anybody in this film, and I tried. No wait, I did like Eva Mendes. No doubt about that! She gave the movie some hope, and represented the closest you're gonna get for the man to have anything to support his inevitable desire to stray.

So, if you're someone over the age of 60, this film is probably for you. However, if you are a younger male and if you want a good fun ""babefest"" film, watch ""Chasing Papi"", ""B!tch Slap!"", ""Man of the House"", ""So Close"", ""D.E.B.S."", ""D.O.A."", ""Cloud 9"", ""Alfie"" (with Jude Law), or even ""Bride and Prejudice"" (the one with Aishwarya Rai).",1235779200,,2693,4.467479674796748

3404532,3,B0017ANAZO,"George Cukor made this film in 1939 with an all female cast and it was much livelier. But first a little story:

Every year at the Castro theater (the oldest theater in California) in San Francisco's gay Castro district, the owner shows this film to a sold out crowd. You can barely understand the dialogue as every person in the audience repeats every single damn line in the movie after having watched it SO many times. Once you get into the party atmosphere, its pretty amazing. The lines are quick, sharp and bitchy and the audience never stops talking or laughing throughout. If you can catch this experience you'll save yourself from this remake.

Meg Ryan (too pretty), Annette Bening (not believable), Jada Pinkett Smith (just mean), Eva Mendes (just mean), Debra Messing (Debra Messing redux), Cloris Leachman (great performance), Bette Midler (same Bette), Carrie Fisher (very brief), Joanna Gleason (okay), and Candice Bergen (well cast) sound like a cast that could only win in any film, but this remake is a dud. Sure, there are a few good lines here and there, but it's bitchy without being funny. It borders more on the mean-spirited side, rather than on the clever and outrageous.

3404546,4,B0017ANAZO,"I am lucky enough to remember the earlier movie of The Women, and can compare this one with some degree of fairness.  The first thing one realizes is that movies today are better and the emotional freight is portrayed closer to reality than any of the movies of the contract studios ever were.  The encouragement with which the manicurist is enticed to divulge her secret is less catty than the earlier film, and the moment of understanding is more emotionally detached than the drama with which it was portrayed in the earlier film.  Detached in the sense that Ryan's character is stunned and in a traumatic funk rather than ""the betrayed woman.""  Then she is angry.  I remember the earlier film and the corny betrayal distress that was the major theme of that film.  Ryan infuses her role with angry humor and strength rather than weak femininity.

I love seeing Meg Ryan in more mature roles now that she has gotten beyond the ingenue period.  Annette Bening is a superb foil as the close and angry friend.  A great cast.

I am also much pleased to see that women are protrayed more realistically.  During the days of the contract studios, almost all roles, especially women's roles, were  stereotyped and all too often the caliber of acting was far below what we can see today.  This movie has a great cast and its own restructuring of those roles to fit into todays lifestyles and concerns.",1234137600,4,1395,4.668032786885246
3404547,4,B0017ANAZO,"I enjoyed this remake of George Cukor's classic 1939 film.  While Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford and Rosalind Russell headed an excellent cast in a sparkling film, Diane English does a good job bringing this update to the screen.  The DVD special features are informative as we hear about what a labor of love this was for English, the long fuse of financing and numerous screenplay drafts before the the project could be brought to screen.

Meg Ryan plays Mary Haines whose husband is having an affair.  Ryan was one of the top romantic comedy starts in the 80s & 90s with great classics such as her Golden Globe nominated ""When Harry Met Sally"" & ""Sleepless in Seattle.""  She tugs at our heartstrings as the woman forced to come out of her shell and gain a better sense of herself.

Annette Bening who I loved in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Open-Range/dp/B0000TANUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Open Range</a>&nbsp;and who has been nominated for an Oscar three times for ""The Grifters,"" ""American Beauty"" & ""Being Julia"" does a good job as the anti-domestic career woman Sylvie Fowler.  This was Rosalind Russell's role in the original.  Bening is always interesting to watch.  Her scenes with Mary's daughter show variety and range.

In the DVD extras, English said she questioned whether 82-year-old Cloris Leachman would be up to doing a role.  But Leachman, whose Oscar was for ""The Last Picture Show,"" glistens as the saucy housekeeper Maggie whose personal opinions keep her continually on the verge of quitting.

Eva Mendes showed me what great depth she has an actress in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/We-Own-the-Night/dp/B000ZS8GWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">We Own the Night</a>.  She may be one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood.  As Crystal Allen, the girl most willing to have an affair with a married man, she combines the elegance & barb of Joan Crawford with street sleaze.  Her scene in the dressing room trying on lingerie makes you want to scratch her eyes out.  She's a delight!

Candace Bergen, who was nominated for an Oscar in 1979 for ""Starting Over,"" reflects great presence as Mary's mother Catherine Frazier.  In her scenes, we are treated to a sizzling cameo performance.  Bette Midler who has two Oscar nominations of her own (""For the Boys"" & ""The Rose"") plays Leah Miller, drying out with Mary.  She is intense, charming and flamboyant in her limited screen time.

Debra Messing from TV's ""Will & Grace"" plays Edie Cohen, the eternally pregant friend of Mary's.  Her comic timing is great.  Jada Pinkett Smith as the gay Alex Fisher adds spice.  I enjoyed her as the maverick captain in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix-Revolutions-2-Disc-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0001BKAEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix Revolutions (2-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>.  Debi Mazar does a great job as the brassy manicurist Tanya who loves to gossip.  Carrie Fisher from ""Star Wars"" has a brief scene on an exercise bike as reporter Bailey Smith.

Overall, the film works well.  I hope it stimulates people to want to check out the great George Cukor film as well as Clare Boothe Luce's excellent stage play.  Enjoy!",1233792000,2,3287,5.557344064386318

It was hard to believe that they would even be friends; a stereotypical lesbian, earth mother, career woman and the ""happily"" married working mother. I didn't care about any of these women. This is a good movie to pick up at your local library and watch for free to pass a few hours but that's about all it's worth.",1233360000,8,400,4.418918918918919
3404550,4,B0017ANAZO,"The Women is a chick flick; there is no use denying it.  But I am surprised that so many did not enjoy it; I unabashedly did.  I thought that Meg Ryan did a credible job in this movie and I enjoyed the cast tremendously.  Love Annette Bening, Cloris Leachman and Candice Bergen.  Ms. Bergen almost ran away with the film; she was so good.  Meg's daughter in the movie (India Ennenga) did an outstanding job as the little girl who is almost forgotten and ignored when Mom becomes absorbed with her own emotions and loss of self esteem.

A little bit of Eckart Tolle finds its way into the movie in the form of some of the spirituality messages which abound in his book The Power of Now.  Meg Ryan asks herself finally, ""What Do You Want?""  Easy enough question to ask; but very hard to answer when you have forgotten what you wanted in the first place out of life and submerged your own goals and aspirations in lieu of what your family or successful spouse wanted to achieve.

At a deeper level, I think the movie discusses admirably how women can take a detour and lose their self esteem while bolstering their family, children and others.  Many times they do not take the time to take some selfish interest in their own needs, desires and goals and they sadly lose their way in life.  Another subliminal message deals with marriage and the importance of keeping the relationship alive by focusing on being happy with yourself and what you bring to the relationship.  Friendship and betrayal of trust are also front and center; and when a person becomes fearful or pushed to the wall; how loyal and trustworthy would they be?  Would you sell out your friendship or your ideals to hold a job or to advance yourself or to save your own neck?

At a psychological and spiritual level, I think the movie really works.  It examines those motivations and life events that many women just take for granted and/or ignore.  Many times women think that what happens in break-ups or marital conflict only happens to other people next door or other family members; until it hits home.  This is very much a story of how a woman picks up the pieces and gets to know herself and exactly what she wants out of life and from herself.

I liked the movie; I love Meg Ryan and Candy Bergen; it was a very entertaining film and it may hit close to home; more than you might expect.  And there is always Bette Midler thrown in for good measure.

And the trick question: There was only one male in the entire movie; who was it?  You may overlook it if you are not careful!  And if you only get one thing from the movie; if you actually start thinking about what you really want; the time spent will not be wasted; but very well worth it and even enjoyable!  There are many good laughs in this film; and everyone can learn to even hate Crystal Allen (the beautiful Eva Mendes who is the ole spritzer gal).

3404559,1,B0017ANAZO,"Women should be disgusted and insulted by the rash of ""chick flicks"" put out by Hollywood in recent years where women are concerned with little else than shopping and romance. This movie features some very good actresses, but the material is banal and completely lacking in depth.
Meg Ryan plays a rich woman who spends her time doing ""fundraising,"" and although she has only one child, somehow requires a full-time housekeeper (Cloris Leachman) and au pere girl to keep it all going.

Annette Bening, one of the greatest actresses ever, seems to be doing an exact impression of Samantha Jones from Sex and the City; someone should have reminded her that she's too old to play this sort of role. It's a fluff piece better suited to that nitwit Anne Hathaway.
The strangest thing about this movie is the complete absence of any men. All the extras are women; in street scenes, there is not a man to be seen anywhere. This gimmick would be affective if the film were not so utterly void of substance. It's as though a statement is trying to be made, but when the whole plot is about Meg's unfaithful husband and how she ""wins"" him back, it becomes all the more irrelevent. And how does she win him back? By becoming a fashion designer and presenting her rather unoriginal inspirations in a typical flashy New York gala. It happens effortlessly; and suddenly she's loveable again and worthy of her husband's attention.
Fashion is far more important than raising money for charities.

Debra Messing's part is so appalling it isn't even worth mentioning, but the worn-out child bearing scene was nauseating. Jada Pinkett-Smith is the ill-cast token lesbian who has to be freaked out by all things baby related. The acting is over-the-top, and the whole plot is silly. Hands down, the only good scenes belong to Canadace Bergen, and whoever wrote her lines should have taken over the whole script because hers are the only ones with any substance or authenticity.
Women in their late 40s and early 50s should not be in appalling films such as this. They should be portraying politicians, movers, shakers, thinkers - women who have lived, experienced, and are taken seriously outside the realm of men, money, and Gucci bags.

In fact, Kristin Davis would have played the Debra Messing character perfectly, and Sarah Jessica Parker even has the same wild hair Meg Ryan's character had.  Candice Bergen was already in SATC so her placement in The Women was a short reach. I also must add that Jada Pinkett Smith is too talented and beautiful to be relegated to the token black/ lesbian sidekick.  And quite frankly, Annette Benning's snippy comment to the woman with the dog at the beginning of the movie-about how she was wearing last years shoes- made me smirk.

There are lots of enjoyable performances, from the sweet heroine Mary, played by Meg Ryan, to the hilarious Bette Midler as a talent agent that Mary meets at a retreat.

3404578,3,B0017ANAZO,"There is much to admire about the 2008 remake of the 1939 comedy classic ""The Women"". How about that cast!  Having such a large assemblage of talented and attractive actors in one movie is  impressive.  The fact that Diane English, the creator of the groundbreaking comedy series ""Murphy Brown,"" is responsible for this new version of ""The Women"" is reassuring.  It is wonderful that she opened doors for as many capable women to work behind the scenes as in front of the camera for this movie.  This rarely happens today.  Another positive is the way that the women's onscreen relationships with one another have evolved from the backstabbing bitchiness of the 1939 original to a more loyal and compassionate nature in the 2008 remake.

But there are obvious weaknesses in ""The Women"".  The characters in this updated version have the potential to be more complex and substantive than their predecessors.  Yet Diane English's script only scratches the surface of these women's identities.  There is scant detail about their individual lives, histories, and goals.  The characters are presented more as ""types"" than as three-dimensional women, i.e., Meg Ryan plays the good wife;  Annette Bening portrays the ambitious career woman;  Debra Messing is the frazzled mom;  Jada Pinkett Smith, the tough lesbian;  Eva Mendes, the man-eating home wrecker, etc.

Credit the experience and resourcefulness of the superb acting ensemble  who manage to bring texture and depth to characters that the story fails to fully develop.  The genuine warmth and respect you feel between these talented actors off-camera enhance their onscreen relationships as well.

Ms. English, whose writing for the classic comedy series ""Murphy Brown"" was truly masterful and funny, seems rusty here.  Her humor sometimes feels forced and occasionally falls flat.

But Diane English deserves praise for bringing an all-female cast back to the big screen.  It's ironic that in the 21st century women supposedly have less value in movies than they did 70 years ago.  This makes no sense and must change.",1230854400,2,2071,5.190332326283988
3404579,3,B0017ANAZO,"""A Female Friendship Film"" is what I would call ""The Women"". A weak remake of the 1939 classic.  I recently rented the DVD (glad I didn't go the movies to see this).  I tried not to compare the  two movies but it was hard not to.  The remake came up short...but if I don't compare them than it is an okay film.  The remake has a totally different feel from the original.  I would describe it as lame!  There is no energy, no drama, no face slapping or cat fights among the women.  They are BORING!  In the 1939 film every woman scratched her way to the top (wearing Jungle Red nail polish).

Meg Ryan (Mary) has made a career in playing ""good girl"" roles.  She is good...no surprise there. Annette Benning is also good as Mary's best friend ""Sylvia"".  That's the problem...she is much more likable in this film.  Benning's ""Sylvia"" would have been much more interesting if she had been bitchier, flawed, with maybe some redemption thrown in at the end.  I did like the scene where Mary and Sylvia made up.  Eva Mendes (Crystal), who is the ""other woman"", should have been a BITCH!  She needed to show how conniving she is...a real GOLD DIGGER!  It would have been fun to see her act mean to ""poor Mary"".  I got a kick out of Cloris Leachman, as the housekeeper because she can do no wrong in my book.  She has made the best of her acting roles even when the parts were below her standard.

The part that I did not think worked well was ""Alex"", Mary's ""lesbian"" friend (they had to make a point of making sure you knew she was gay and how the straight friends seem to tolerate it).  Jada Pinkett Smith can't act!  Her role would not have been missed if it had been cut out.  Debi Mazar, who played the gossipy manicurist can't act that well either.  Years ago she had a more interesting look (more severe) than she does now.  Bette Midler was GREAT in her bit part and it would have been greater if it had been BIGGER and she looked better.  They made her look old and tired.  Her talk was even slower.  What a waste ...but hey, it just shows that the Divine Miss M can do older, slower talking, dumpy looking characters...she's versatile!

Diane English wrote and directed this film.  I can tell she is a nice person.  It shows in her film.  A gay man would have done a better job(at least a bitchy gay man).

The ending was dumb.  Come on... Debra Messing (Edie) screaming in agony while giving birth and everyone is running around acting silly.

3404582,5,B0017ANAZO,"Warning:  minor spoilers ahead.

I found this remake of the 1939 film The Women to be quite enjoyable.  I was worried that it was going to purge all the bitchiness of the original, but some of that remained, and it is quite witty and clever in other places and ways.

Even though it makes about as much sense to me to compare the two versions of The Women as it does to compare Massenet's Manon to Puccini's Manon Lescaut or Puccini's and Leoncavallo's versions of La Boh&egrave;me with each other, I'm going to do that anyway.  I'll say up front that I think there is room for both versions.

Contrary to what is implied in the trailer, the remake has more in common with the original than I had first thought.  It carries over several lines from the original, including two of the very best lines.  There are places where it is obvious that they are setting up to bring over one of the original wonderful lines and those sequences are lots of fun because of the anticipation that the line is coming.  The best line from the original (the one about the kennel), on the other hand, shows up with almost no warning and in a very different place, spoken by a different character.

The film doesn't follow the original scene-by-scene by any means.  There are some unusual plot twists such as having the phone call Crystal Allen gets at Saks Fifth Avenue, which is how it is known in this picture (as opposed to the thinly-disguised Black's in the original), take place at, rather than behind, the perfume counter, so that the women who are ""creeping up on her"" (this phrase is not carried over) get to witness the call.  Also the manicurist, who is called Tanya rather than Olga in this version, is brought back toward the end for an interesting plot twist.  There is a fashion show although in this version it is part of the story and not just a divertissement.  While the implication is there in the original that the writer character played by Jada Pinkett Smith has an alternative lifestyle, they leave no doubt of that in this version.

There are differences, of course.  Bette Midler plays the fairly small part of the Comtesse de Lave, who goes by a different name, although she acknowledges that sometimes people call her ""The Countess.""  While Buck (different last name, which I don't recall) is mentioned, nothing really comes of that subplot other than the implication that the Comtesse may end up making him husband number six.  Buck never gets involved with Crystal either.  The biggest change is the character of Sylvie (rather than Sylvia) Fowler, who does not gloat over Mary Haines' sufferings; she feels genuine remorse at having played a part in the publication of the story of the fight between Mary Haines and Crystal Allen.  She is loyal to Mary Haines throughout the film, even during the disruption in their friendship, and so she never makes friends with Crystal Allen.  In fact, it could easily be argued--especially on the basis of one of Mary Haines' lines--that Mary's relationship with Sylvie is more important to her than her relationship with Stephen.  Little Mary obviously thinks very highly of Sylvie as well.  Then again, this is much more a pro-woman picture than the original.  It was probably influenced to an extent by Sex and the City from what I gather (I haven't seen it), so it only makes sense that the women would take their relationships with each other very seriously.  Another difference is that there is one male character in this version although it is entirely possible that that character is at least played by a female.

Accordingly, since Sylvie and Crystal never become friends, Sylvie is not involved in the scene in Crystal's bathroom.  That scene, now only involving Crystal and Little Mary, brief as it is, tracks the original more closely than any other part of the film, or maybe it only seems that way because Eva Mend&eacute;s has obviously studied Joan Crawford and her speech patterns and reactions in that scene very closely.  There is another superfluous and not really believable--or maybe it is, in a way, given the way things are nowadays--plot twist involving Crystal, who otherwise does not reappear in the film after the scene in her bathroom, that comes out during the closing credits.

I thought it bogged down a bit about two-thirds of the way through the film, and perhaps that was because that was the place where it diverged the most from the original.  On the other hand, there were certainly places where I found the lines funny or where I was completely engaged in the film where those sections had nothing to do with the original.

I don't follow modern films that closely so I'll avoid detailed comments on the actresses.  I'll simply say that I thought the acting was good throughout and I really liked the girl who played Little Mary.  I wouldn't say she was better than the original, whose character and acting style was very much of that period.  The one actress in this film whose work I am familiar with is Debra Messing, from Will and Grace, and I must say that she has amazing breath control as is evidenced by the final scene.  The trailer made it look as though her role was much more prominent than it turns out to be, possibly to take advantage of her being possibly the best known actress of any in the film.  She is very important in the heartwarming ending, however.  Some of the important characters from the original are missing, such as those played by Paulette Goddard and Joan Fontaine.  Thre is no divorce ranch so there is no Marjorie Main either.  I wish the wonderful Carrie Fisher had had a larger role.

Anyway, aside from the little bit of time where the film bogs down in the middle, the two hours went by pretty quickly.  The Women is certainly a better film than the reputation it has garnered.  Comparing it to the original film, I probably would have only given it four stars.  However, since I think the film stands well on its own without reference to the very different original (which I also love), I'm giving it five.",1230422400,8,6036,4.665406427221172

Annette confides in their close circle--a circle consisting of gender bender Jada Pinkett-Smith and the ever-pregnant Debra Messing.  But delivery of the news by her friends is not necessary...as a manicure by the same nosy gossiper relieves them of their duty.

First off, the characters are unbelievable concocted affairs that attempt to be funny by speaking very quickly when delivering their largely boring dialogue. Overacted jib-and-jab banter is the norm here. Unfunny at best and un-watchable at worst, THE WOMEN is a slow, ponderous train wreck from start to finish. Some of the scenes are so poorly constructed that not even the frenetic back-and-forth dialogue that saturates the movie can bring any life to them.

Another problem is the gimmicky nature of the movie: there are no male actors in it at all. Not even extras. Gimmicks have and always will be about drawing attention to something that doesn't really deserve it. In this case, doubly so. Strewn with stereotypes, pithy anecdotes, and shabbily developed characters, it left this reviewer wondering what, if anything, the movie was supposed to be saying about the fairer sex. Certainly very little positive; even the daughter of one of them tries to burn her own tampons, desperate not to grow up to be one of the shallow, empty souls this movie presents as 'women.'

Believe the many negative reviews of this movie. It really is that bad.",1230249600,7,1183,4.96969696969697
3404603,4,B0017ANAZO,"How clever to use ""The Women"" as a title for a film dealing exclusively with women! I say that both facetiously and seriously. The name ""Stephen Hanes"" is most often used in ""The Women,"" but he never appears. So, what is the message? Is there an easy answer to the problems between men and women? Not since Adam and Eve and that was a long long time ago.

""The Women"" makes the statement that forgiveness is a dish best served with a back-up plan. Meg Ryan, in a more mature role than she normally plays, is the one married to Stephen Hanes, who, everyone discovers, is having an affair. Why, for crying out loud? Meg's character is pretty, can do anything around the house, is involved in charity events, and claims to be great in bed. (For one thing that puffed up, kinky hair annoyed the heck out of me. And what's up with her lips, or out, I should say--Meg has the new, yucky, puffy lip style now.) As her mother (Candice Bergen) tells her, men admire women who achieve on their own.

So who's the man stealer? Eva Mendes in a hot, frankly--slutty role. She looks great! Does Meg keep a stiff upper lip (no pun intended) as her mother advises, or does she leave the scoundrel. Leave him she does and throws lives in chaos, particularly her daughter's, a tween.

Three generations, three reactions to a marital break-up. At a weekend retreat Meg learns from an edgy Bette Midler to live selfishly. Ask: What do I want? That begins Meg's regeneration as an independent person, particularly as a fashion designer, her life's goal until she married.

Other issues concerning women spring up in this mult-layered story:
1. Annette Benning (looking worse than I've ever seen her--what's up with that flat head?) is Meg's best friend. Their friendship is ruptured as a result of the separation and must be mended. She plays the successful single friend whose career has hit its peak. This is another issue.
2. Jada Pinkett Smith--in my honest opinion--plays the ""gay black"" friend. Her role in the movie did not feel authentic to me.
3. Why in the world would the gorgeous Debra Messing play that last scene? It was so grotesque and utterly unnecessary!
4. However, Candice Bergen's role as a matronly mother feels so right.
4. And why would a director keep Cloris Leachman so tightly zipped? Wasted talent there.

But the message is clear. Men are nice (sometimes), but they're really not to be trusted. (That statement also applies to hussies who leech married men of their time and money.) Most of all, forgiveness works out if it can be freely given, if there is a grounded person giving it.",1230249600,2,2593,4.640522875816994

3404605,1,B0017ANAZO,"I had great expectations for this movie. However, I was extremely disappointed. The dialogue was dreadful and the characters were ridiculous.

3404606,4,B0017ANAZO,"I watched this film without making comparisons to the earlier version, and there were so many wonderful comedic actresses in this film - Candice Bergen was a particular standout - that the slightness of the story line was not a problem. A film with Annette Bening, Meg Ryan, Carrie Fisher, Cloris Leachman, Ana Gasteyer, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Debbie Mazar, and Debra Messing gives one an awful lot of talent to enjoy.

In little ways, there is a ""Sex and the City"" vibe (although there is no sex in this film).  Bening's magazine-editor character does have some Cynthia-Nixon-ish mannerisms, and Jada Pinkett-Smith's author-character reminded me at times of SATC's Carrie Bradshaw, that is, if Carrie had been a gorgeous black lesbian. But that is where the resemblances end.

And Eva Mendes, as the villainess of the piece (a Saks Fifth Avenue perfume counter shopgirl), has features that make her a Julia Roberts for the 21st century - all big doe eyes, and a 2000 megawatt smile.

This film is fluff, but if you're fans of these actresses, you might like to watch this - possibly with your girlfriends.",1230163200,3,1103,4.913978494623656
3404607,1,B0017ANAZO,"The gloriously funny 1939 version of THE WOMEN, one of my favorite films, has been rewritten (in a vain attempt to make it relevant); it has been modernized, vulgarized and generally ruined in this truly awful movie.  There's no sense blaming the actresses.  Most of them are excellent and try hard; indeed, Candice Bergen, Cloris Leachman, Bette Midler, Carrie Fisher and several others do their level best to bring some life to this horrible script: to no avail, it's quite hopeless.  Annette Bening is reliably vital and always welcome.  Debra Messing, just the opposite.  Meg Ryan, who looks disturbingly re-engineered, is somewhere in the middle.  Ms. Smith and Ms. Mendes are certainly adequate to their tasks, but there's just no saving this debacle.  I watched it with a growing sense of disappointment accompanied by moments of genuine horror.  Poor Meg Ryan has to say, when describing how she had reliably satisfied her husband in bed, ""I can suck the nails out of a board and that's a fact.""  (Try imagining Norma Shearer delivering THAT line.  No, perhaps you'd better not.)  This movie is worth watching only as a bad example of remakes - a film this awful does exert a kind of fascination: can it really be so bad?  A second viewing confirmed that it can be and is.",1229990400,10,1280,4.794520547945205

Candice Bergen was awesome, and the performances were fine, but the script? Oh dear god, please kill me before ever having to watch this drivel again. Silly scenes. Why was the Jada chracter even in it? Added nothing, and I love her!
