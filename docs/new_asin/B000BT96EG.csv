2439754,5,B000BT96EG,"I'm still not over my high of having Season 1 of Lois and Clark on DVD!  Now with Season 2 being released just days before my birthday, I couldn't have asked for a better gift!  Season 2 of Lois & Clark is without a doubt worth buying!  It's basically impossible for me to pick a personal favorite out of the 4 seasons this show was on the air, but this season definitely has some of the best episodes!  Tempus Fugitive, Lucky Leon, The Phoenix, Whine Whine Whine, And The Answer Is, That Old Gang of Mine, Season's Greedings ... oh I could go on!  Finally getting to see Lois fall for Clark was what made season 2 so amazing and of course that was just the icing on the cake.  I literally cannot wait for January 17th.  I think the extras will be great, I'm really looking forward to hearing Dean's commentary on the first episode he wrote and of course I also can't wait to see my fellow FoLCs being interviewed!!  Now we just have to hope the WB doesn't drop the ball and that they plan to release seasons 3 and 4 by the end of 2006!  If you're reading this, chances are you're already a fan so buy this set, I know you won't be disappointed!!!!",1130025600,10,1148,4.205479452054795
2439755,5,B000BT96EG,"This series got better as the seasons went on. The first season was great, don't get me wrong, but I'm very excited for each upcoming release. Season 2 was filled with great moments, from the 'death' of Clark to the first date, to the proposal...I love this show. I'm bummed out because I won't be in the country when it's released, but you can bet it will be waiting for me at home for my return!!",1129766400,4,398,4.25
2439756,5,B000BT96EG,"It was under $30 when it was released and this one seems considerably more expensive.

2439757,5,B000BT96EG,"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman is my favorite show of all time. The show was on for four seasons from 1993-1997. What made this show so special was the great chemistry Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher had on screen along with a great supporting cast. I was a huge fan watching the first episode in the fall of 1993 (I was 16 years old) and never missed an episode. When the last episode aired in 1997 (I was 20 years old) I was sad because like so many other reviewers I grew up with this show and it was a huge part of my life. I remember every Sunday night I would look so forward to seeing Lois & Clark. Me and my best friend Maria would talk about the show the next day and say how we had so many similarities to these characters. I am so happy that that the fans are finally getting a DVD release of all four seasons of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. This show means so much to so many people because it was a good show that lasted longer than anyone ever imagined it would. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman Season 2 DVD set will be released January 17th, 2006.

Below are The Bonus features on the DVD set
-Lois & Clark: Secrets of Season 2
-Marketing Metropolis: The Fans of Lois & Clark

2439758,5,B000BT96EG,"Season 2 of Lois and Clark was one of the best seasons of the series.  (It didn't really jump the shark until Lois ate those frogs in season 3.)  Lois still doesn't know Clark's secret, but unfortunately Lex Luthor has disappeared as a regular nemesis. However, Lois and Clark's relationship, the real impetus of the series, heats up.  Overall, the villains aren't quite as campy as the following seasons.  This is the one that left everyone cliffhanging for the summer over what Lois was planning when she took off those glasses.  Would she say ""yes"" to his proposal?  Had she figured out his secret?  Hopefully we won't have to wait as long for Season 3 to be released to DVD.

This second season release will supposedly have features on Lois and Clark's fans, special commentary from Dean Cain on ""Season Greedings"" the episode he directed, and more behind the scenes of the season.

2439777,5,B000BT96EG,"Very enjoyable entry into the Superman saga. Dean Cain gives a good portrayal of Clark Kent/Superman. Actually the actors who have  portrayed The Man of Steel on the small screen George Reeves, Dean Cain, Tom Welling and of course John Haymes Newton & Gerard Christopher, depending on the scripts, can bring more depth in their portrayal of Clark/ Superman. The exception is Christopher Reeve who always was one of the best actors to wear the S. The 2nd season is probably the best of the series. If your a fan of Superman you will enjoy the 2nd Season very much, on the whole the series is a keeper!",1466985600,,600,4.555555555555555

2439840,5,B000BT96EG,"I now own the first three seasons of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.

Developed for television by Deborah Joy LeVine (based upon characters created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster), the series loosely follows the philosophy of then-Superman writer John Byrne: Clark Kent is the true personality and Superman a disguise. As the show's title suggests, it focuses as much on the relationship between Clark Kent and Lois Lane as the adventures of Clark's alter-ego.

Dean Cain played Clark Kent/Superman and Teri Hatcher played Lois Lane. Both did a GREAT job with their characters. Actor Lane Smith does a great job portraying Perry White, the Editor in Chief of the Daily Planet. Eddie Jones portrays Jonathan Kent and K Callan appears as Martha Kent.

If you are a fan of Superman, this season of and the entire Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman is a must have addition to your Superman collection.

I plan on purchasing Seasons 3 & 4 in the near future. Buy yours today and enjoy this wonderful TV show.

The TV series as a hit when it first aired and lasted four seasons. It should have aired for many more.

In Season Two (19941995),  Michael Landes was replaced with Justin Whalin as Jimmy Olsen. The official reason, according to Landes, was that he looked too similar to Dean Cain. Series creator Deborah Joy LeVine and the entire first-season writing team were also dismissed. The new producer, Robert Singer, planned a stronger focus on action; the show also shifted its focus onto the budding romance between Lois and Clark.

Lex Luthor returned in one episode and other villains from the comics, such as The Prankster, Metallo, the Toyman and the criminal group known as Intergang, began to appear. The show featured new love interests for the ace reporters: Dan Scardino (Jim Pirri), a government agent interested in Lois, and D. A. Mayson Drake (Farrah Forke). This season also featured the debut of fan-favorite villain Tempus (Lane Davies) and H. G. Wells appeared as a time-traveler. Wells' younger self was played by Terry Kiser, and the older Wells was played by Hamilton Camp.",1429574400,,2118,4.863888888888889

2439843,5,B000BT96EG,Still entertaining after almost 20 years.,1428883200,,41,6.0
2439844,4,B000BT96EG,"As usual, this season was decent just like Season 1. We get to see the relationship between Lois and Clark develop in different ways. And we watch Lois become understandably annoyed with Clark every time he disappears, because she still doesn't know that Clark is superman. In fact this is something that Lois holds against Clark for most of the season.... causing her to see him as being too flaky for her tastes.

 There's some love triangles going on in this season, but thankfully they don't seem to take up the whole season as the main story... instead it just happens in the background while the major stuff happens. Which makes those love triangles less irritating for those who are tired of love triangles on their superhero shows.

 However I had to take away one star, because there was a few things I didn't like about this season. Such as the fact that they choose to kill off a wonderful woman like Mayson Drake (Clark's second love interest), just for some pointless drama. And since they felt that they still needed a love triangle, they bring in some guy named Dan for Lois? What was the point of killing off Mayson Drake then if they still needed a love triangle?? ARGH! I think that Mayson Drake should had continued to live.... so that Clark could had dated her, while Lois dated Dan. That way Clark and Lois would have some method of comparing how they felt about each other compared to what they felt for Mayson or Dan. And then to resolve the love triangle/rectangle thing, I would have Mayson and Dan fall for each other. Since they seem like they would had been a good match for each other due to the fact that the two of them work for the law and have somewhat similar personalities.
 Have Mayson and Dan hook up, which then leaves Clark and Lois free to date each other.

That's how I would have done it anyway. the second reason why I had to take a star off is due to the fact that Clark proposed to Lois AGAIN in the season finale. And I just get the feeling that next season we wouldn't even see Lois and Clark talk about marriage at all. I can't help but wonder if all Season finales are going to be like this, with Clark proposing to Lois every single time, only for nothing to happen next season? I'm gonna laugh if this turns out to be a pattern for season 3 as well.",1428451200,,2300,4.387323943661972
2439845,5,B000BT96EG,Always loved the series. Only reason I didn't buy these years ago was because I figured I would spend  all my time watching TV. The chemistry of these two actors is addicting.,1428105600,,175,4.46875

I have found no aid so great as that of making the mind follow the body movements.  The motion of an awning  mind are not only very jerky and wasteful but they are exceedingly quick.  Such a mind vibrates with the speed again destructiveness of lightning, and the owner simply cannot compel it to be absolute be quiet.  But he can direct as well as to a very great extent.  By directing the mind to follow the body motions, which are infinitely slower than mental motions, he can accomplish great things to ward quieting the line.

Kudos to producer Deborah Joy Levine for making a romantic comedy of the Man of Steel and Lois!",1383177600,,503,4.25
2439909,5,B000BT96EG,"perfect condition.  The dvds are in perfect shape, unopened and had plastic sealing the set.  Very pleased with this product!",1381708800,,125,5.2
2439910,5,B000BT96EG,"If the main themes of first season of Lois and Clark were Lex Luthor vs Superman and the relationship between Lois and Clark/Superman, then the main themes of season 2 were ""Would they get together""? and ""Would Lois find out""? The show underwent two major changes in the second season. First, John Shea was no longer a series regular. He only appeared in one episode where he was brought back to life after having died at the end of season 1. As a result the show became a villain of the week format. Many times notable guest stars were cast to play bad guys. Some of the notables in season 2 were Bronson Pinchot (who those of us around in the 1980s remember from the short lived TV show Perfect Strangers) was wonderful as the Prankster, Raquel Welch, Michelle Phillips, Sherman Helmsly and Isabelle Sanford, Bruce Campbell and others. While I do think the show did lose something not having John Shea in more episodes because he was fantastic as Lex Luthor, the format they established worked well.

The second major change was recasting Jimmy Olson. While I do not think Justin Whalen was horrible, I just think Michael Landes had so nailed the part in the first season, that the recast really hurt. Especially at the beginning of the season. Had Whalen been cast from season one, I think he would have fit better. The standout episodes of the season were Seasons Greetings, Tempus Fugitive, and the two Prankster episodes (The Prankster and Return of the Prankster). The only story lines that I think got too overdone were the two separate love triangles. First between Lois, Clark and Mayson Drake, then Lois, Clark and Gardino. It just gave the story too much of a soap opera element. The writers were obviously trying to keep Lois and Clark apart for as long as possible because a show like that always loses steam when the lead characters get together, but two separate love triangles in the same season was just a little overboard. Especially since you essentially had a similar story in season 1 with Lois, Clark/Superman and Lex.

The show really did hit its stride in season 2. How much you enjoy it probably depends on where you fall on the changes in cast and how soap operaish it could get. Twenty years on the show has held up well though. The extras are fairly basic. Commentary by Dean Cain on the episode Seasons Greedings which he wrote, a 10 min feature on season 2 with interviews of the cast and writers, and a short feature on the fan base of the show. The A/V quality is about what you would expect from a mid 1990s show of that nature. The special effects were better than in season 1, but nothing compared to what you would see today, and the picture is nowhere near the HD quality of the shows you get these days. With that said however if you enjoyed the show when it was on, or even from seeing it in syndication it is definitely worth adding to your collection.",1378080000,,2893,4.540229885057471

2439938,2,B000BT96EG,"As I said in my review of season one, Dean Cain as Superman is very weak. His Superman would rather talk, and just stand there and fold his arms, than actually do something. Season two is more of the same, Robert Singer came along to produce this season. And the focus is more on the action, there's still romance in the air. Lois And Clark have their first kiss in this season, they start Dating. But wait, the assistant D.A Mason Drake loves Clark. That story line was totally wasted, it's almost like they didn't know quite how to handle it. So they just threw it in there, and after two episodes she's blown up in her car. Lois keeps getting mad at Clark for always running off, Now the biggest problem, is they throw in agent scardino. As kind of a rival to Clark for Lois's feelings, annnnd it just doesn't work. They don't give him much to work with, and the actor's not that good anyway. Now we come to the Tempus episode, H.G Wells has traveled to the future to see what it looks like. And he brings back Tempus,  Now Tempus doesn't like the future because there's ""140 channels with nothing on"", no violence. And he doesn't like it, so he's going to go into the past to kill Superman. A very well done episode, another one is ""Phoenix"". The return of Lex Luthor, who is after Lois. The only other good episode, is ""Seeing Red"", when intergang discovers Red Kryptonite. And uses it against Superman, they discover it makes him Apathetic. And Bruce Campbell plays Bill Church Jr., and he does a fantastic job. Yes Clark does propose at the end of this season, which ends with a cliffhanger to set up season 3. I won't give more than 2 stars, because there were too many moments, chracters, and episodes. That contributed nothing, even Metallo was destroyed in this season.",1347408000,,1780,4.476923076923077

I always remember Lois said that every woman who in love think that her man is superman. It's true, I only fall in love 1 man in my live and now become my husband, and I still watching this series every year !",1321315200,,492,4.135416666666667
2439940,3,B000BT96EG,"The first season was probably the very best for this season, however the second season is very good.  The story ideas in these episodes are mostly strong, the chemistry between the leads can't be beat, and the quality of the acting from both the regulars and the guest stars is excellent.  Even Dean Cain shows much more acting strength this season than the first.

Cast Changes:  The ""new"" Jimmy Olson is a bit of a shock, and takes some getting used to after a full season of the other (""first"") Jimmy.  Frankly, I liked the first season Jimmy better, but he was very different from the Jimmy of the comics.  This new Jimmy is more traditional.

""Cat"" is gone.  Some will celebrate that as an improvement, and some will miss her.  While the character was new to this series, I thought she was a good ""foil"".  I missed the character, but her absence is not central to anything.

Lex Luthor is not in many episodes this season, and I think that's a real loss.  Many of the stories are quite strong without him, but the portrayal of Lex was so deliciously terrific that the show feels a little weaker without him.

Overall, this is a very good collection, and I strongly recommend it for anyone who has the first season.",1309824000,,1219,4.486363636363636

2439943,4,B000BT96EG,"The first season is really the best and strongest of the show, though to really get everything out of the show you have to watch this one.  You have to realize that a lot of things that made the first season really great changed in season two, so that it could focus on the relationship tease between the title characters, which is done very well.  You lose a lot of the good for what is in a lot of cases something better, but you also get the first of the really bad cheesy episodes.  Not to say that all the episodes in the first season were stellar, but not to this level.  However the really good episodes here are even better than the really good ones of season one.  Season one is all about Lois and Clark meeting, and Superman having a fight with Lex Luther, with a lot of then ""modern"" references of female empowerment and so on.  I think that one of the more interesting parts of the show as a whole was that it really did demystify a lot of modern social norms and remind people what has worked in society for a long time, and tries to decorrupt a jaded modern world, though a lot of these attempts are a bit cheesy at best.  The second season is really the build to them getting together, which they eventually do, but you have to stick around for season 3 for the reveal that Clark is Superman, though it is brought up during the cliffhanger that is ultimately unsatisfying in the Season 3 opener. (If the bad episodes are starting to get to you I suggest that you download that first episode of season three, and the wedding episode from season 4 and call it a day with the show) and Season 4 is their life together, which really relieves most of the tension the show was building.  The other big changes for this season were that they got rid of the ensemble cast, or at least parts of it.  They got rid of the old Jimmy Olson, who at least to me seemed like a much more well rounded character in favor of a one dimensional hopeless romantic kid that seems to have lost the whole trying to live up to Perry story arch as now Perry just gives him bad dating advice, (Though the Denise Richards cameo is fun to watch) and admittedly a better looking guy, but not nearly as much fun.  Kat is gone completely, as the modern sexual implications that she brought I guess were just not where the show was going, as it seems to be more directed towards children this season, but there are no shortages of getting Lois to be in situations that allow her to get wet or messy in a variety of kinky costumes that show off her assets.  I mean there is a fight going on, and hey Teri, you are going to have a cat fight in the cake with the other girl, because Superman obviously can't handle another mortal female.  Not that I'm complaining, but they don't even hide what they are trying to do here.  Sometimes I felt like a schmuck for watching when really this was one of my favorite shows growing up, I guess I haven't changed as much as I like to think.  Well for good or bad the egos are starting to grow this season, the romance takes center stage, and this really is the last good season of the show, but I still recommend it.",1307232000,,3134,4.2365771812080535

Superman DELIVERS...and it's  all SMASHING GOOD CLEAN FAMILY FUN, as always. My only gripe is that the Bond Girl didn't appear in more episodes.

2439952,4,B000BT96EG,"Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman Season Two is a very good sophomore season. They were still looking for their exact stride, but were getting closer to the mark. We saw the exit of Tracy Scoggins as Cat Grant, Michael Landesas the first Jimmy Olsen, and John Shea as Lex Luthor. Personally, I liked the old Jimmy and the Cat Grant character but the networks said that Michael Landes looked to much like Dean Cain and the Cat Grant character was to adult for the time slot. What are the fans to do? But never fear, Jimmy was back with Justin Wallin who did an admiral job at being the bearer of bad news over and over and over... But enough about what they changed, what stayed the same? Dean Cain makes a great Clark Kent and an acceptable Superman (I will always look to Christopher Reeves for the ultimate Superman- You will believe a man can Fly). Teri Hatcher puts out an excellent showing as one of the best Lois Lanes EVER, not a cigarette chomping witch and not a push-over, but a confident self-assured career women. K Callen and Eddie Jones are back as the Kents. Lane Smith is back as the Elvis loving Perry White.
In this season, there are some terrific moments and some stellar episodes. Ending with one of the best cliffhanger episodes for fun television, ""And the Answer is...."". Don't miss the christmas special ""Seasons Greetings"" or the entrance of William Wallace Webster Waldecker (say that 3 times fast). Then of corse there is the 2 Prankster episodes that are alot of fun. We see the introduction of Intergang, a criminal empire that will be a thorn in Lois's and Superman's side on and off for the next 2 seasons. We also get to meet Tempest and HG Wells in season 2. While I didn't much like the creators interoperation of HG Wells, I did like the Tempest character. He makes several repeat performances in season 3 and 4. There are secrets, exposures, near misses and all of the things that made this series Great TV.
The DVD set is packed in much the same way as the first season. The annoying double overlay disks are here- and if you are like me you will be replacing them with the slimline cases so that your disks will not get scratched at the expense of the episode guide.

2439959,5,B000BT96EG,"Season two picks up in the aftermath of Lex Luthor's (guest star John Shea) death.  Even though the villain has been unmasked, the citizens of Metropolis seem upset with Superman (Dean Cain).  Even more unsettling is the idea that Lex might not be dead.

But Lex plays a minor role this season.  Intergang has moved into town in their disguise as CostMart and are attempting to take over the city.  But that's not all investigative reporters Lois Lane (Teri Hatcher) and Clark Kent have to face this year.  There's the Prankster, an evil mastermind who wants to incorporate Lois into his criminal pranks.  A whistleblower is in danger when he discovers faulty products have been used.  Gangsters come back to life and start wrecking havoc on the city leading to Clark Kent's death.  A toy maker figures out a way to bottle greed and sell it to kids and adults right before Christmas.  Superman is sued by someone whose life he has saved.  And Jimmy Olsen (Justin Whalin) becomes a trained assassin.

But since this is the romantic comedy take on the mythology, all this plays out against the backdrop of the building romance between Lois and Clark.  There are complications with love interests for each of them.  Clark struggles with maintaining his two identities and keeping them secret.  All this leads up to a cliffhanger aimed squarely at their relationship.

And, best of all, it is fun.  The Christmas episode is the only clunker in the 22 episodes presented here.  Instead, we get cases that not only present decent mysteries but also find ways to challenge Superman.  It can't be easy to create new ways to put all the characters in danger each week.  (Although I do have to wonder if anyone in Metropolis checks for traffic before crossing the street.)

And the romance is played perfectly.  Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain have perfect chemistry for the part.  They make it believable.  And their flirty dialogue is always fun if not downright funny.

This set contains all 22 episodes from the season in full frame and stereo sound.  Extras are limited to an audio commentary on ""Season's Greedings"" by star and episode writer Dean Cain.  There are also two fetaurettes, one of the fans of the show and one on season two.

When we last left Lois and Clark, Lex Luther had taken a great fall (right off the top of the tallest building in Metropolis), Lois had realized she might just have feelings for Clark ""not superman"" Kent, and Clark cut his nose off to spite his face by telling Lois that he lied about being in love with her.

Being the man of steel doesn't nessesaily make you smooth with the ladies.

To avoid spoiliers, which I hate seeing in reviews, this reviewer will only say that of the four seasons, season 2 was the most fun. Some familar faces appeared as guest stars, a rival for Lois's affections was intoduced, a foxy blonde D.A that had the hots for Clark popped in and out throughout the season, and the season finale had me shouting at the tv way back in 1995.

In my opinion, Lois and Clark really hit their stride in Season 2. It was beating Seaquest most Sunday nights and in general its ratings were decent. Dean Cain was the darling of Teen Beat, Bop, Tiger Beat and several other magazines that I regret to say I do remember the titles of. Teri Hatcher was on the cover of Entertainment Weekly and several other ""important"" publications and there was finally merchandise to go with the show; yours truely had a t-shirt, poster, collectors cards and the graphic comic book novel that featured comics that inspired episodes.

I would like to claim I collected these out of a sense of nostaglga or a foresight that one day there would be a giant online yard sale to unload that crap on, but the truth of the matter is that I was a 13 year old girl who was in love with Dean Cain.",1213142400,,1653,4.374592833876221

I could not wait to watch all 4 seasons and can't for the life of me understand why this show was cancelled. (I heard network politics and I believe it.) I was depressed to get to the end of season 4 and not have another to watch.",1212710400,,540,4.046728971962617

Most Lois and Clark fans will agree that season 2 is the best season of them all, and arguably one of the best seasons of television in the last two decades.

Originally, Lois responds with her own question that ends in a rather cliff ending remark for the season.  On the DVD, however, the final episode of Season 2 ends with Clark's question, which if you've never seen the show will leave you with less anticipation.  The editing like this is petty and really brings down the onset of Season 3.

For me, the story concentrates not in a comic book hero with no faults, but in a good intelligent and very kind person who happens to be an alien with special powers. The decision to use those powers to help rather than to hurt makes him maybe a little unrealistic for these times we are living in, but I love watching the series and believing for a short time, that we can be better and nicer, and that the world could be a better place if we were a little more like him.

Most episodes are very well written, the chemistry between Lois and Clarke es terrific, and Clarke`s parents are delightful, especially his mother, who is intelligent and funny. The characters are well rounded and the dialogues are witty and good fun.

I recommend the series wholeheartedly.

2439973,5,B000BT96EG,"Lois & Clark came along way for married duo for a long time. They're relationship, in real life a lot of people would give anything what Lois & Clark have in real life. They had a lot a ups and downs it was worth it to get them together. Out of all the t.v. shows of Superman shows I seen, no one could do what these could do. I never have to worry about Dean Cain being typecast as Superman or the Superman curse. He's doing just fine, the difference between George Reeves as Superman and Dean Cain Superman is George Reeves's Superman is a like a Saturday Morning Cartoon show. Have the time when he plays Clark Kent, Jack Larson plays Jimmy Olsen and Noelle Carter plays Lois Lane. They're like playing Ward, Beaver and June Cleaver in Leave it to Beaver. George Reeves and Jimmy Olsen were like father and son, than friends. Dean Cain is playing Superman, he was like a teenager than can't grow up and I saw another side Clark Kent I never seen before. He has feelings, problems and he was scared all the time. When he was Superman, that he was just like a regular person like everybody else, the show was revolve around Clark Kent than Superman. Dean Cain love playing Clark Kent than Superman, Superman is kind of symbol for good and hope, has to follow truth, justice and the american way. Even though I hated that slogan truth, justice and the american way, they're just words but to me Superman is guy a like to help. Clark Kent has feelings, problems, trips, nerdy, sarcastic, he can say anything he want more than Superman than does and perverted like me. That's the reason, how I admired Clark Kent in the first place. When I was watching Smallville, the relationship of Lois and Lana are kind of the like the same relationship as Lois and Clark. The same was, Lois was trying to get close to Clark, he always leave when theirs danger when they were talking about something important. A lot of times Clark always wanted to tell Lois who he was, never had a chance to. But he did and they're still together. That's the same relationship with him and Lana had in Smallville, but the difference is when Lana found she was a target and nearly got killed by Lex. When Clark went back in time and didn't tell her. That's the reason, why he never tells anybody who he is somebody could be a target or trust. When Teri Hatcher was playing Lois Lane, in a couple episodes she was Clark's Rival, to best friend and girlfriend. Lois Lane was compared to in Smallvlle, as Lana Lang and Chloe Sullivan. Chloe Sullivan was kind of like Clark's Private Investigating team buddy, just like Lois was in Lois and Clark. Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher are like the Adult Tom Welling and Kristin Kreuk of Lois and Clark.

2439974,4,B000BT96EG,"*POSSIBLE SPOILERS WITHIN*

I loved the first season of LOIS & CLARK.  I thought it was absolutely wonderful.  It was charming, witty, original, creative, fresh, and romantic, a delightful re-telling of the Superman legend.  I was excited to begin the second season, but a little cautious because of the infamous ""sophomore slump"" that many shows endure.  Season Two does have the dreaded sophomore slump, but thankfully, it's only a mild case.

A lot happened in Season Two.  ""The Prankster"" introduced one of the few villains from the Superman comics to actually appear on LOIS & CLARK: The Prankster, rather annoyingly played by Bronson Pichot.  Intergang, a major crime organization from the Superman comics, makes its first appearance in ""Church of Metropolis"".  Another Superman villain appears in ""Metallo"" (can you guess who?), as does Lois Lane's (Teri Hatcher) sister, Lucy Lane.  In ""That Old Gang Of Mine"", a scientist clones 1930s gangsters like Al Capone, John Dillinger, and Bonnie and Clyde, and Superman (Dean Cain) must stop them.  ""Season's Greedings"", written by Dean Cain, is one of the series' most ridiculous episodes, but it does feature guest appearances from Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford (who played the title characters on the TV show THE JEFFERSONS), as well as a young Denise Richards.  The season really improves when ""The Phoenix"" hits, a magnificent episode in which a bald (!) Lex Luthor (John Shea) is resurrected. Red kryptonite was introduced in ""Individual Responsibility"", although on LOIS & CLARK red kryptonite makes Superman bored and sleazy rather than evil and reckless as it did in the comics and everything else.  ""Tempus Fugitive"" is one of the most popular episodes of any 90's TV series and is regarded by many fans as the best episode of LOIS & CLARK.  In that episode, H.G. Wells (Terry Kiser - Bernie in WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S) builds a time machine and travels to 1990s Metropolis, where his evil partner Tempus (Lane Davies) steals the machine and travels back to 1966 Smallville to destroy Superman.  Lois and Clark go back in time to stop him - and the biggest secret in the world is discovered, if only for a fleeting moment.

The real thing that keeps this season going is the romance between Clark Kent, Superman, and Lois Lane.  It really heats up toward the end of the season, especially during the season finale, during which I guarantee you'll be shouting at your TV screen quite often.  The rain-soaked cliffhanger is at once shocking and disappointing, but you won't want to miss it.  To complicate Lois and Clark's relationship, the writers came up with two characters: the immensely irritating Dan Scardino (Jim Pirri), and the tragic Mason Drake (Farrah Forke).

The problem with the second season of LOIS & CLARK is that it lacks the freshness and creativity of Season One, to the point where it becomes immensely silly.  Too silly.  The villains are far too over-the-top, with the exception of John Shea's Lex Luthor, who is wonderful.  What redeems the season is that every once in a while something astonishing happens.  The most astonishing moment of all is a death scene at the end of ""Lucky Leon"".  It's an incredibly powerful scene made all the more so by Jay Gruska's beautiful music, which is subpar throughout the rest of the season.  The visual effects range from being very good to very hokey, but that doesn't really detract much from one's enjoyment of the show.

I realize, and by now you probably do too, that I am having a hard time putting my thoughts on paper (so to speak).  That's because I adored the first season of this show, and I have many thoughts on the second.  Let me just say that though the season is silly and occasionally hokey, it is almost always fun.  You may want to stop watching mid-point, but if you stick with it 'till the season's end, you won't regret it.",1159574400,2,3870,4.8551829268292686
2439975,4,B000BT96EG,I thought that second season was when everything in Lois and Clark really started to click.

2439993,4,B000BT96EG,Lois & Clark's adventures continue with a lot of good episodes and some not-so-good. Justin Whalin takes over as Jimmy Olsen....bad move!,1151712000,,137,5.2727272727272725
2439994,5,B000BT96EG,"While many critics of this series claim that after the second series it was went down hill obviously watched a different show to what I watched! This is pure all round entertainment. The love affair of Lois and Vlark is hotter than ever!! With rivals thrown in jealousy is arrif, Clark feels dejected after the stumbling of their relationship at the end of season one and decides to take action with his love life breaking free (supposedly) of his fair maiden's bonds he looks for love in the arms of Mayson the DA. An interesting character summed up in Lois' words 'pushy' she is a determined gal and she wants Clark. Fallen in love already unbeknowedst to Clark, she is all out for him even if it means fighting Lois. However it is her eventual untimely demise that leads to further friction - Clark sulks Lois feels rejected oh dear...

Stage left Dan Scardino - call me Dan - a creepy 2nd rate love struck romeo. He wants Lois and Clark feels threatened but he does nothing Lois acts and regrets follow. He loves her she loves him when's it gonna happen??? A finale that ties up these questions only to 'pop' another it will leave you in the edge of your seat and begging for release... But you have to wait until season three for any sense of closure.

A great buy an everlasting classic - Hatcher is the ultimate Lane she is in control but vulnerable, needy but independent, loving but distant. She is the modern woman and she knows it! Deborah Joy Levine said she put Lois' name first because she wore the trousers and as I don't doubt their wardrobe choices I don't doubt that for a second - girl power.

Drool over Kent/Cain and laugh out loud at the hilarity of the comic genius of Peri and Lois, the loving nature of Clark will have you near to tears. No more. Just buy it.",1151280000,2,1784,4.416413373860182
2439995,4,B000BT96EG,"I used to think that Smallville was much much better than Lois and Clark but now that Smallville is sorta depressing and predictable I think otherwise. Long before season 5 we knew that Clark can't be with Lana and now that Lana is with Lex things are even worse. Clark saved her life a hundred times and half the times she even knew it. So now she says she can't trust him and owes him nothing. Clark catches a bullet that almost hit Lana. Lana of course didn't see that and just because Lex stepped in front of her she says ""you saved me"". Was Lex even hit ?, No, so how did he save you ? So that's just an example of how bad Smallvillie is now. I find all that stuff painful to watch. We've seen too many episodes where Lana walks up the stairs to Clark's room to have some emotional talk.

  In this season of Lois and Clark, they decide to date and yes they have their problems but at least this show is light-hearted. When they argue about Clark always running off when they are having a serious conversation, you understan why Lois would be angry. Plus when they argue it's not as painful to watch or depressing like Clark or Lana having their 1000th conversation about him having too many secrets.

  There's a lot less Lex Luther this season, he comes back from the dead and shaves his head bald. He stalks Lois since he wants her back but she moved on and has feelings for Clark now. Anyway sadly Lex is only in one episode this season. The show manages fine without him though. Bronson Pinchot (Perfect Strangers) does a good job as the Prankster in 2 episodes. He has it out for Lois since a story of her's put him in jail. There's also a good episode where Lois and Clark have to follow a man from the future into the past where he plans to kill superman where he's his most helpless...a baby. What makes it good is that he reveils to Lois that Clark is actually Superman. She has to try and get over being mad at Clark never telling her so she can help save his future. Smallville always has people finding out Clark's secret just to have their memory conveinently erased. This is the first time I actually saw it happen on Lois and Clark. While Smallville does it way too many times.

  Anyway though I think this is a good season, I think the show put Lois and Clark together too soon. It was sorta better before they started dating but I'd rather see mushy and cutsie episodes about them then see Clark and Lana have on more painful break-up on Smallville anyday.  Hell I'd prefer if they just had Lana leave Smallville period so can finally focus on stories that don't focus on Clark and Lana . Who's not tired of seeing him moping around looking sad about Lana. This show may be a bit overly silly sometimes but give me that over painful and depressing any day. I mean in the season finale of the last season, Lana told Clark she doesn't know why she ever loved him after everything he did for her. It's depressing.",1147219200,2,2934,4.308529945553539
2439996,5,B000BT96EG,"""Lois & Clark"" is a fantastic TV show and one of the very few that's worth watching over and over again.

2440001,5,B000BT96EG,"I had to wait for several long weeks to recieve the most awaited DVD pack from the United States...

As same as for the First Season, Warner didn't share Lois and Clark with the rest of the world : the Daily Planet won't show up in France, which is kind of weird because French subtitles are the second ones available, just after English... There are fans over here, please don't forget us!

Anyway, discovering Lois and Clark again with the original soundtrack is a new adventure for us (in France, actors record new voices over the original ones). THANK YOU to Warner Home Video that didn't protect its DVDs from being played in Zone 2 machines!

Anyway, the second season begins quite weakly, with few creative plots and no interesting evolution between our two (three) heroes. Fortunately, the apparition of Mayson Drake and then Dan Scardino brings the two friends to ask themself questions about their relationship.

New vilains try to replace Lex Luthor, but he has to come back from death to kick them with their I'm-a-bad-guy laughs.

The end of the season is delightful : Lois and Clark in love, and maybe a secret revealed...

Conclusion : new characters, new plot, new visual effects, new adventures...

I love it!

PS: This is the first time I write a review in English, please do not judge me!

Can I ask you a question? Why are there so often vilains speaking French in American serials? (episode 14 'Top copy': ""Qui ne voudrait pas a?"", ""Tu parles Franais?"" ""Un peu"")",1141862400,7,1483,4.694980694980695

They figured out the flying fx a little better, refined the characters a bit, came up with stronger plotlines, got rid of a few characters, and replaced Jimmy.  I was fine with the first one, but Justin Whalin simply does a much better job.  I think that Dean Cain does an excellent job as Clark and as Superman, and is certainly one of the guys who is most believable as Supes.

Personal favorites include The Phoenix, Lucky Leon, Tempus Fugitive, and of course And The Answer Is...  If I could give this series more then 5 stars I would.  I highly recommend it.

2440033,5,B000BT96EG,"Warning:  Spoilers in review!

Season Two was both very similar to Season One and very different.  It was different in that the show underwent some very significant cast changes.  It was same in that the romantic chemistry between Lois and Clark continued to be very much at the fore front.  In fact, as in Season One, the major concern in the show was the progress of their romance.

Going into Season Two, ABC decided that the show needed more of a family slant.  They therefore had the show remove Tracy Scoggins, who had played the ultra sensual Catherine 'Cat' Grant in Season One, from the cast.  Her hypersexual mode of behavior and dress was seen as nonconducive to creating the proper family atmosphere.  My own feeling is that her character was never successfully integrated into the show and therefore her absence was not a great loss.  I was more troubled by the decision to replace Michael Landes as Jimmy Olsen.  The reasoning was that Landes and Dean Cain were too similar as physical types.  They didn't look exactly alike, but both were tall, lean, and dark-haired.  They could plausibly have passed for brothers.  Nonetheless, I liked Landes and the place he occupied in the first season.  Justin Whalin, who was stockier, had lighter hair, a much fuller face, and seemed to be slightly shorter, replaced him.  Under no circumstances could he have been mistaken for Dean Cain's brother.  While I didn't feel that Landes's dismissal from the show was justified, Whalin also did a fine job as Olsen, though all in all I think the two did an equally good job in the role.  The third major cast change was the departure of John Shea from the show as a full time cast member.  Watchers of the show will recall that he died at the end of the Season One finale.  He was brought back briefly in Season Two, sans hair, and made a few additional appearances in the show later.  But for all practical purposes, Shea was gone.  The threatening presence of Lex Luthor was replaced by the crime syndicate Intergang.

But the romance was the thing.  The original model for LOIS AND CLARK was always the romantic comedies of classic Hollywood.  The show owed more to the interplay between Nick and Nora Charles than to any superhero show.  The previous TV show that most accurately captures its spirit was MOONLIGHTING.  There is no question that Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain had tremendous onscreen chemistry.  They were not merely a devastatingly gorgeous couple; they were a wonderfully fun to watch.  The season saw a gradual alteration in their relationship.  Season One had ended with Clark first declaring his love for Lois, only to have her reject it, only then to have her return his advances after he had decided that their being together was perhaps not a good idea.  In Season Two, however, the heart, as Robert Frost put it, began to cloud the mind, and Clark eventually summoned up the courage to ask Lois out on a date, and Lois summoned up the courage to accept.  Their romance saw a few bumps towards the end of the season, but Season Two ended with Clark on bended knee, an engagement ring in his hand, awaiting Lois's response to his proposal.  The one truly irritating moment in the season was unquestionably the words ""To be continued . . . "" that concluded the finale.

As in Season One, the romance between Lois and Clark always too precedent over Superman's crime fighting adventures.  Nonetheless, the individual crises were a bit more compelling this year.  There were several compelling adventures.  My favorite--and the romantic highlight of the year--was the episode ""Tempus Fugitive,"" in which H. G. Wells in his time machine enables a criminal from the future to return in time to a point where he can undo Superman and prevent the future utopia that resulted from the union of Superman and Lois Lane.  The criminal, Tempus, played with great gusto by Lane Davies, reveals to Lois just who Superman really is.  Much of the episode deals with Lois's intense anger at Clark/Superman for not having been honest with her and asking him how she could ever come to trust him again.  Meanwhile they frustrate Tempus in his goal of undoing Utopia and Wells returns them to their own time to the point at which they will not remember what had just happened, telling them that it wasn't yet the right time for Lois to learn about Clark (implying that there would come such a time in the future).  The episode was so successful that both Wells and Tempus would make additional appearances on the show, Tempus several times.

So, the second season of the show came to an end, this time with the cliffhanger of what Lois was going to say to Clark.  Makes you wish that the next set in the series was being released sooner rather than later, doesn't it?",1138665600,6,4770,4.689530685920578
2440034,3,B000BT96EG,"I love this show! I love the guest stars on it too. Jimmy Olson in this season was more of a cutty, then the last one. I had a problam with the red krypanight in the season. They said that the red one is for makeing superman eazy going, but really it make him do whatever he want to do. and where wes cat? I wanna see that (...) again.",1137888000,2,335,3.8
2440055,4,B000BT96EG,"First of all, I myself fell in love with this show about three years ago watching it in reruns over one summer. I could not possibly be more excited that it is finally coming out on DVD.

That being said, it does have its flaws. I would be the first to admit that Dean Cain (though I love him and his character dearly) is not the most fantastic actor in the world. His lines and expressions occasionally seem forced, and he has this sort of stock gesture he makes with his hand that feels fake -- but despite all that, one can't help falling in love with his Clark. Once you get to know the character, you can ignore these minor details. And besides, of all of the various actors I know of who have ever played Superman, Dean Cain is the only one who (in my opinion) actually fits in both sides of the character. He makes sense as Superman, and he makes equal sense as Clark.

Also, granted, there is a note of cheesiness to the series -- but it's an intentional sort of cheesiness, really. The show pokes fun at itself and the genre from whence it springs simply by playing into the cliches and pointing out the general weirdness of the Superman universe. Yet, despite the cheesiness of the plotlines, the characters and their relationships are treated with sincerity.

Teri Hatcher's performance is impeccable, and she and Cain balance each other out perfectly. The mild feminist undertones (mainly with respect to Lois's character) and the emphasis on the fact that Clark is the real character and Superman is the alter ego (which, to me, is one of the most interesting aspects of all Superman lore -- Clark's dilemma) combine to make this the only Superman series I genuinely like (much less love...). In general, the show contains a wonderful assortment of humor and heart, and I would reccommend it to any and all that I see.

(P.S. Though I have to say, the third season is easily my favorite...)",1137801600,7,1903,4.539358600583091
2440056,5,B000BT96EG,The second season of Lois and Clark is probably the best of all four seasons. I miss this show veru much.,1137628800,5,105,4.0476190476190474
2440057,5,B000BT96EG,"Building off of great Season 1 ratings, Lois and Clark continued retelling Superman's saga through Clark Kent's historically-underappreciated perspective. 44 episodes of the 1994-1995 season balance a perfect mix of romance, intrigue, and adventure to `home deliver' the best 'news copy' around.

""Madame Ex"" is an excellent example of such quality. Lois was engaged to marry Lex Luthor (John Shea) at one point, but she learns that he simultaneously had tried to marry another woman. Arianna Carlin (Emma Sams) comes back in a fiendish plot to take out Superman and makes an evil copy of Lois. Because Carlin forgot to actually take out Lois first, the real Lois investigates her double with Clark and saves the day. In this version of the epic, Lois is a `superhero' in her own right.

This episode is also important because it marks the first appearance of Justin Whalin as Jimmy Olsen. Whalin replaced Michael Landes from the previous season because he looks more boyish and supposedly did not resemble series star Dean Cain.

Farrah Forke begins her special guest-staring role as District Attorney Mayson Drake in the episode ""Church of Metropolis"". This immaculately-coiffed and dressed law enforcement official repeatedly attempts to investigate Intergang---and get her personal hooks into Clark. Because Lois is aware of her own growing feelings toward Clark, she becomes jealous of this relationship. Drake is a recurring character throughout most of this season, inadvertently providing comic relief with her pretense to know everything about everything. Drake dies in ""Lucky Leon"".

Another (and intentional) form of comic relief was ""A Bolt From The Blue"". Superman's powers temporarily extend to William Wallace Webster Walldecker (Leslie Jordan) when they are both struck by lightning during a suicide rescue attempt. Realizing that he now has 'superpowers', the man and his wife Wandamae (played by Cindy Williams, who is of course best known for 'Laverne and Shirley') charge people for `Resplendent Man' services-infuriating Clark who always did `Superman' out of kindness. On top of this, the evil Dr. Gretchen Kelly (Denise Crosby) figures that Superman's powers can be duplicated for criminal gain and subsequently attempts to capture Lois for
'bait'. She knows that Lois is the most valuable thing to Superman and he does anything to save her-including risk himself. Dr. Kelly would make another appearance, resurrecting Lex Luthor in ""The Phoenix"".

Clark might have other-worldly powers, but he is not immune to diabolical plots as `Season Greedings"" (written by series star Dean Cain himself) demonstrated. Sherman Hemlsely and Isabel Sanford reunite from their ""The Jeffersons"" days to play a diabolical toymaker couple attempting world control by turning everybody into children. They really do a fabulous job of acting like vengeful people who don't have a molecule of the holiday spirit inside of them. I also liked the performance Cain gives as the 'childish' Clark just because it was so cute to see the one-time professional linebacker running around with a tantrum. Curiously/thankfully Clark did not use any of his superpowers during his tantrum though.

""The Eyes Have It"" is a more serious episode because it poses the question what would happen if a scientist had something strong enough to make Superman go blind-even temporarily. While people are convinced Clark Kent escaped to the mountains with Mayson Drake, he is really (as Superman) recuperating with Lois's help. Since Clark does not usually get sick or hurt, he immediately understands how serious his situation is and also realizes his 'recovery period' marks somewhat of a relationship turning point with Lois. Lois does not know who he really is, but (unlike many other Metropolis residents) honestly does not expect Superman to be flawless and invulnerable. Instead, she helps him when he needs it (and presumably had no where else to go).

Superman encountered another personal nightmare during ""Whine, Whine, Whine"". A musician (Jason Carter) decides to sue Superman for allegedly injuring him during a rescue. Calvin Dregg believes the 'man of steel' broke his arm and wants to take Superman to court for recovery of damages- financial and emotional. Clark is very physically strong, but also prides himself on not hurting innocent people with those powers; both the initial claim and ensuing copy caters become a veritable PR nightmare. Because Superman lacks 'contact information', going to court for this and the other claims also consequently threatens Clark Kent's secret. Here again, Superman heavily depends on Lois for emotional support and counsel; she exposes the initial 'injury claim' itself as only being a scam artist's hoax. Both Adam West and Frank Gorshin (who worked together on the far campier 60's 'Batman' series) put in special guest appearances during the episode.

Uncovering Superman's real identity is a repeating threat up to the end of this season. First, Diana Stride, (Raquel Welch) an assassin for Intergang who poses as the host of the tabloid TV show ""Top Copy"" wants to tell the world Clark Kent's secret  in ""Top Copy"". Contrasting with Lois and Clark, Stride is a tabloid journalist who specializes in the sensationalistic junk which the Daily Planet does not even consider publishing on back pages. Because several tabloid news shows were then-on television, the episode is also a real-life reference to the problems which tabloid series ultimately create for journalism the profession. Initially-popular tabloid TV shows subsequently diminish the credibility of all journalists because the public then expects the later to also report news in a sensationalistic manner and at all costs; ironically becoming upset when all their news sounds the same.

Lois finds out Clark's secret in ""Tempus Fugitive"". They have to travel back in time to 1966 Smallville with H.G. Wells (Terry Kiser) to prevent Tempus Fugit (Lane Davies) from killing the baby Superman. For if there is no Superman, Fugit and other criminals of the world can stay above the law.  Understandably, Lois is jarred by this news---her co-worker from 'no-whereseville' is THE Superman, but it does explain Clark's frequent disappearances (which increasingly had gotten on her nerves). Unfortunately, that knowledge gets quickly erased and Lois once again becomes exasperated with Clark's behavior in subsequent episodes. We would not receive permanent resolution of their tension until later seasons.

It's Clark's turn to become jealous when Lois gets involved with Agent Dan Scardino (Jim Pirri). Scardino is sent to probe Drake's death and subsequently arouses Clark's own resentment. Even a mild-mannered reporter from Kansas becomes caught in the battle for a woman's affections when he realizes that Lois Lane is in fact ""Ms. Right for him"". Clark also concludes that he must act on the desire to be with Lois.  He proposes to Lois during the genuinely cliff-hanging season finale ""And The Answer Is...""

Extras in this package include ""Lois and Clark: Secrets of Season 2"", ""Marketing Metropolis: The Fans of Lois and Clark"", and a commentary on the ""Seasons Greedings"" episode by Dean Cain himself. I'm appreciative that the people involved with this series have an understanding of just how much it still means to fans and are not above continuing to work with it. Kudos to Dean Cain himself for giving fans the `inside scoop' on this beloved series.",1137542400,5,7462,5.286075949367088
2440058,5,B000BT96EG,"I love this show, I remember being so incredibly excited when it came out. And this season was fantastic. The episode ""That Old Gang of Mine"" is my favorite episode ever. Clark having to fake his death... it's FANTASTIC, so funny. And, of course ""Tempus Fugitive"" when Lois learns she is known in the future as the stupidest woman in the world for not recognizing Clark as Superman... and she gets so angry at Clark. These episodes are classic. After this season, the episodes begin their decline. The first and second seasons are the best of all of the Lois and Clark episodes. I love this season, it's packed with great episodes!!",1136332800,,632,4.651785714285714
2440059,3,B000BT96EG,"i saw a book or editorial entitled a ""Superman for Each Generation"" and i agree with that sentiment.

This is an overlooked series from the 90s.  i always here Teri Hatcher spoken about (now), ""Lois from the Lois and Clark series...[she] was better known for her infmous publicity shots, wrapped in Superman's cape than for the series.""

I highly doubt that...anyone who was a teenager when Lois and Clark came out watched that series at least once...and most of us guys watched it b/c of Teri Hatcher.

But this was Superman for the teenager of the 90s.  Cheesy yes, but with updated views of woman in the workplace and Superman's fight with his alter ego Clark (or rather Clark who is Superman in this series).  But this is no more cheesy than smallville (which i also like)...as Clark is a virgin in Lois and Clark, which was a push on safe sex and such themes of the 90s, Clark is no longer a virgin in Smallville as is the carefree attitude of today's Gen Yers.

But enough rambling...know about the show

This season puts Lois and CLark together in many situations that let them get closer, intoduces a 3rd wheel in Clarks D.A. Girlfriend, and eventually has Lois figuring out Clark is Superman at season's end.

I think this season is good overall but has a few useless episodes that don't push the main story (which in this case is Lois and Clark relationship).  New Jimmy (guy from Buffy and serenity captain i think), new Lucy Lane.  Popularity really goes down hill for the show during this season.

The biggest problem with this season is that there is no unifying conflict for all the characters like with what smallville does with Meteor storms, or Luthor revenge, etc...

L&C had that in the first season (one of the best pilot seasons for any show from the 90s) with the fall of Lex Luthor, but didn't build with another main villan in the 2nd season.  Oh yeah, people will say what about InterGang...that isn't quite the same...that's like a 4th or 5th season filler.  The show does try and bring the new Kyptonian children with Zod and such in the 4th season, and i thought this should have been brought up to follow up Lex's death in season 1.  By then no fans except us hardcore fans and no fans = no ratings = no show.

If you can get for a decent price which i doubt, buy this...

I expect as the season releases progress, sales will decline or people will wish they hadn't bought them.

by the way, i like season 3 more",1133827200,6,2442,4.471783295711061

2440062,4,B000BT96EG,"This is the only TV show that I have purchased the DVD's but it seems reasonable to believe that the sound, picture and aspect ratio could have been mastered from the Master Copy which I was told was shot in widescreen aspect with Dolby sound. Perhaps I was misinformed but if true , it would have taken this wonderful show to another level of enjoyment for the fans. Season One if i remember correctly was the one I liked best. It had the best arch- villian (played by John Shea, the best actor to play a villian on the show) and it took itself seriously enough to not cave in to the urge to get Lois and Clark into a relationship. Season 2 is committed to moving right into that despite the ending of the final episode  of Season One. I thought this weakened the show's dynamic tension. It was pleasant and sometimes even wonderful, but to me it wasn't better. Still, it is fun and I will buy all the Seasons once the price comes down locally. I paid a third of the price they're now asking and was thrilled by the value. The following season's are not worth 40+ dollars to me each. But I'll be patiently waiting for a deal. Glad to see so many people love the show you probably had alot to do with this being brought to DVD, although it is obvious that they are now putting EVERYTHING out on DVD.
