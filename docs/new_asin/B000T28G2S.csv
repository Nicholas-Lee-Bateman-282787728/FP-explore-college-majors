2892167,5,B000T28G2S,"I'm a big fan of this series, having watched the Japanese version and now the English version on Adult Swim as the air each episode every Saturday. I will be acquiring the Mangas soon as well, but my question is is the DVD really gonna have the first 8 episodes? That will be a change from just having the first 4-5  eps. And I hope they do it with the other DVDs too so we don't have to wait as long for the series to come out in full.

This anime gets my two thumbs up and if you like a good story the n this is definately for you.",1193011200,3,533,3.8363636363636364
2892168,5,B000T28G2S,"Well, I'm not much for writing reviews, but when I seen this great anime was finally coming out on DVD all I have to say is if you love anime, then you must buy this. This series is one of the best stories ever told, and the artwork is also exceptional. Anyway, I swore to buy this no matter the price when it finally arrived, and it's almost here. I can't wait.",1192665600,2,362,4.041666666666667
2892169,5,B000T28G2S,"""Death Note"" the anime is finally arriving on American shores and it's about time.  The manga is hugely popular in both Asia and the USA and has even been banned in China due to it's perceived bad influence on students. There have also been two live-action films. So how does this story translate to the small screen?  Having not read the comic, I saw this show with fresh eyes and it practically ruled my life until I finished it.  This is one of the most intriguing, complex, and unique television shows of any genre and you will be missing out if you choose to pass it by.

The story focuses on a boy, Light Yagami, who comes across a notebook at school one day.  He takes it home and reads it's contents, finding instructions for using this ""Death Note"" (as it's labeled).  Any human whose name is written in it, dies.  Naturally, one would assume that this was a joke, so he tries it out on a criminal holding hostages live on television. It works, all right.  A normal child would probably burn it, or at least hide it away and never use it again, but Light is an exceptional boy, one with an (almost) unrivalled intellect and a severe hatred of crime; not to mention a megalomaniacal streak a mile across.  So he decides to use his new found power to rid the world of criminals and establish a new world order with him playing God and delivering justice as he sees fit.  Shortly after finding the Note, Light meets it's owner, a shinigami (death god) named Ryuk who is one of the most psychotic-looking anime/manga creations ever; like the Joker had a baby with a feathered demon or something.  So why would a shinigami like Ryuk want to leave a Death Note in the human world?  Why, because he was bored and that's just how Ryuk rolls.  He's a disturbingly likeable character with an addiction to apples -which symbolize original sin, of course, and serve as kind of a symbol for the series- and an antagonistic nature that has him constantly cackling in the background as the events of the series play out.  He also gives Light somebody to talk too in his solitude, lest the series get too bogged down with voice-overs.

Soon, people take notice of the deaths and the hunt for Light is on.  He is dubbed ""Kira"", a Japanese corruption of ""killer"", and a special investigation team is formed, headed by a reclusive genius detective that goes by the name ""L"".  L's intellect matches Light's and the chess-like move-and-countermove game between them is mind-boggling to watch and forms the base of the series.  As a character, L is a true original: a pale-faced boy with deep black owlish eyes, a series of of unsettlingly bizarre habits and mannerisms, and an insatiable sweet tooth.  He is the closest thing ""Death Note"" has to a true hero (discounting the side characters such as Light's father, who risk their lives by aiding in L's investigation) since the protagonist is a cold-blooded killer who soon begins hunting and killing those sent to investigate Kira.  The result of all this is a wild ride that will leave your head spinning at times and make you appreciate just how good writing can get for a television series.

Once you start this show, you will not be able to stop as the plot constantly thickens, more characters are introduced and killed off, earth-shattering developments and brilliant schemes play out before your stunned eyes, and the story just keep adding more and more layers until you feel immersed in this world of constant struggle for the future of the earth.  All this from one notebook.  It was a cool concept to start with, but the unbelievable writing is what makes this anime must-see material.  Welcome to your new obsession.",1186185600,62,3667,4.632148377125193

2892241,5,B000T28G2S,"Death note is an anime (Japanese animated television series) made by MadHouse Studio Japan. It is based in a manga (comic) created by Takeshi Obata and Tsugumi Ohba. This anime series have 37 episodes, which premiered in 2006.

It is the story of a high school student named Light Yagami, who found a book called ""death note"". This book gives the power to kill people by writing the name of the victims and knowing their faces. Doubtful at first, Light discover that this book can help to create a perfect world. Therefore, he decides to kill every criminal in the world. This event unchains a fierce battle between Light and the police force leaded by a super detective called ""L"".

The show is very well developed; it contains a solid plot with many characters that can be related to. Many characters die in ways that at first are simple, but then Light uses intricate and very elaborate ways to kill people. The series idea of the conflict if kill the criminals is good or bad give the reader a lot to think. I said that because the idea of create a perfect world and punish the crime is rooted in humans. The authors play with all the emotions and thoughts that this can cause in human minds. Despite this, their own values are shown in the final events of the series. Despite all the efforts of Light, the world returns to what was at the beginning, humans are not perfect and therefore, it cannot exist a perfect world.

The series is very intense in many moments. Many deaths are very crude and hard to digest, that is why I wouldnt recommend for people below 15 years old. There is a lot of complicate dialogue and thoughts that can make small children very confused. It is not a series that would call the attention of people who is purist and they can be offended because the main plot can be found twisted and inappropriate because it mixed a lot of religion and existentialism. Despite that, if you are someone who likes existentialism and series that display human nature and ideals, this show is great for you.

There are some cheesy scenes (like Light using his pen like a sword) but they don't detract from the fact that this is a very serious, mature drama and definitely not meant for children. One of my friends saw me watching this and was like ""aren't you too old for cartoons?"" but once I sat her down and made her watch the first episode with me, she agreed that it was great and definitely not for kids. There is nothing in this volume that is particularly violent (even the deaths are just heart attacks) but it IS a story about a mass murderer and a death god. Show it to children with great care, or not at all. Sometimes the actors do use swear words, but once again, it is not very often. I love how you can watch it in original Japanese as well. Some of the japanese voice actors are much better than the American ones. Light's english VA, however, beats out his japanese one, imo. The evil laugh is perfectly psychotic and he captures Light's sociopathy and ""innocence"" perfectly. Ryuk's voice actor never seemed to fit (I could only keep imagining the OVER 9000!!! crap each time I heard him), but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the series.",1340150400,,1265,4.410256410256411

It's the tale of a young man who finds a notebook in which writing the name of a person will cause that person's death.  (Yes, there's much more to it then that, but that's the barebones basics) He soon takes up the cause of justice, but finds himself opposed by an equally gifted adversary. (That's it, that's all the plot I'm giving you, I don't want to ruin anything.)
This series has two great strengths.  First are the great characters and the chemistry between them; the second are constant plot twists that keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat.
But these also turn out to be the weaknessess of the series as well.  There are times when it gets so caught up in plot twists that it ties itself into knots, and late in the series, new characters are introduced that aren't as well developed and the focus seems to be more on the mental chess match, and not the people playing it.
The ending unfortunately falls a bit short of the grandeur you'll be expecting given the strength of the first two thirds of the episodes, but it is still one of the most engrossing series I've watched--animated or otherwise.

2892293,5,B000T28G2S,"I first caught ""DEATH NOTE"" on television. I've heard so many impressive things in regards to the storyline and also saw the series featured on NPR. To get the critical acclaim that it has worldwide, this series must be special.

And special is what ""DEATH NOTE"" truly is. From beginning to end, this series has just grabbed my attention because of its well-written cat vs. mouse storyline.

""DEATH NOTE"" is a 37-episode TV series that was created by Studio Madhouse and featured on Japanese television in 2006-2007 and featured in the US in 2007-2008. The series has spawned a popular manga series, a novel, three live action films and has captured the attention of anime and non-anime fans worldwide.

The series focuses on the character of a very smart high school student named Light Yagami. Bored with his life, he comes across the ""Death Note"" that has special instructions that if one was to write their names on the Death Note, the person would die. They would die of a heart attack if there were no instructions on how the person is to die. Or die the way the person possesing the Death Note wrote down.

The Death Note is from a Shinigami (death god) named Ryuk who seems to be bored in his own world and thus starts to enjoy how a person like Light starts to use the Death Note.

For Light (who goes by the name Kira), starts out using the Death Note by writing the names of criminals. He starts to win supporters due to his ideology of creating a new world without these criminals. But with so many deaths occuring, the police and the International community begin to fear this serial killer. And along the way, Light is suspected by the police as a person of interest (a person who could be ""Kira"") and then Light starts to use his Death Note on those who are onto him.

Thus a mysterious detective named L is assigned to the case and the series becomes a compelling storyline of will L find a way to catch Light Yagami or will Light Yagami kill L first? Two geniuses trying to outwit the other in a thrilling storyline that is so unique, I'm confident in saying that it's one of the most original anime to come out in the last decade.

The volume 1 box set features on the first half of the series (twenty episodes, five DVDs, four episodes per disc) as Light Yagami (Kira) moves forward to create his new world, while L and the Kira Task Force try to stop him. Also, that there may be another person in the world who may possess a second Death Note as well.

AUDIO & VIDEO:

""Death Note"" was a TV series and I found the animation to be quite cool as it showcased a dark, stylish feel to it. Featuring a good dose of J-rock and style to it's overall presentation, Studio Madhouse did a wonderful job in this series and bringing out the illustrations of Takeshi Obata and the storyline of Tsugumi Ohba to television. The dark atmosphere really is well displayed in this anime series.

But the most appealing part of this series is the awesome voice acting. Being the Japanese language purist that I am, I watched the series with Japanese voice acting and it was done very well. But I have to admit that I was really impressed by the English dub voice acting.

Brad Swaile as Light Yagami, Battlestar Galactica actor (Felix Gaeta) Alesandro Juliani, Brian Drummond as Ryuk and Shannon Chan-Kent as Misa did a tremendous job. As did the other English voice actors. A job well done!

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Personally, I wasn't sure what kind of ""special features"" would be included on the DVD box set but you do get a really awesome behind-the-scenes interview with the English voice dub talent. Here are the special features featured on the Volume 1 Box Set:

* Disc 1 - Behind the Scenes with Brad Swaile ""Light"", Clean Opening and Ending
* Disc 2 - Behind the Scenes with Alessandro Juliani ""L"", Japanese Director and Character Designer Interviewer
* Disc 3 - Behind the Scenes with Brian Drummond ""Ryuk""
* Disc 4 - Behind the Scenes with Shannon Chan-Kent ""Misa""
* Disc 5 - Behind the Scenes with Chris Britton, Vincent Tong and Trevor Devall ""The Kira Task Force""

And on each disc, production art and trailers are featured on each disc. What I enjoyed about the behind-the-scenes footage is that they were lengthy and not super short. You really get a good insight on the actor's take (from the beginning of the series) of their character, the challenges they faced in doing the vocal work and much more. So, it was very cool to have these extras included on each disc.

I can't tell you how awesome this TV series is. ""Death Note"" is truly special as it really show how power can corrupt but taking that cat versus mouse type of storyline of two geniuses trying to outwit each other.

There are literally so many twists and turns in this anime series that it really captures your attention and has you on the edge of your seat.

As for the DVD box set, I think it's just great that Viz Media chose to feature 20 episodes of the series and sell the box set for a great price! I definitely like Viz Media/Shonen Jump Home Video really doing anime fans a great service by following a US TV Season Box Set style of pricing instead of selling the episodes as separate volumes. You're definitely getting your bang for the buck.

Overall, a well-acted anime series (on both the Japanese and English side of things), cool characters, well-written episodes, stylish animation and a unique, compelling anime series that I highly recommend! A+",1235952000,,5446,4.544433094994893
2892294,5,B000T28G2S,"Death Note is an amazing series.  I'm so happy to see it becomming so popular lately.  Death note has a little for almost everyone in it.  Bishie boys for the girls..  a suspenseful and truly amazing plot for those who like mysteries..  amazing art...  At first I was skeptical of the series from someone's description of it.  How exiting could a manga about such a seemingly cliche concept be?  Amazingly exciting.  An inverted mystery story that will make you question your morals.  A lot of heart wrenching, shocking moments.  You won't be on the edge of your seat, you'll be on the freeking floor.",1233273600,,601,4.6826923076923075
2892295,5,B000T28G2S,"Not being an avid Japanese anime viewer, I was - at first - hesitant when I was shown Death Note by a friend.  He told me it wasn't like normal anime (see also: screaming death explosions in ""Dragonball Z"", earth-shattering battles in ""InuYasha"", etc.) which interested me.  I began watching it and became instantly hooked.

The story isn't entirely about the freakish notebook known as the Death Note.  It's about the morality in what's right and wrong about what to do with those who have committed human atrocities and yet still are allowed to live in human society.  Killers who roam the streets and kill time and time again and somehow slip through the fingers of the justice system.

The story of the Death Note surrounds one young man named Light Yagami and his efforts to end the consistent tragedies in the human world.  And through his efforts, he decides he will become the ""God of the New World"" once the world is ""cleansed of evil"".  But is consistently hounded and investigated by a mysterious world-famous detective known only as ""L"".

2892296,5,B000T28G2S,"So I said I hate it and yet I give it 5 starts right? Why? Well I hate the whole idea of how the main character is no hero at all, but rather a villain, an anti-hero. He is evil,childish and manipulitave. So why do i watch it? Simple. I want the main character to lose. That's right I hope that while I am watching this series the antagonist gets the better of him. With that aside I will say this. This show has some of the most brilliant writing I have ever seen in any TV show. The entire premise is original yet at first glance it would seem difficult to make a good story out of it. Once you start watching the series, you will be amazed by the genius in all the writing. Nearly each episode has some twist or cliffhangar att he end that leaves you wanting to watch the second. I will not discuss the characters or even any of the plot, because quite frankly, people have discussed it enough as it is. Rather I want to enlighten potential buyers that what makes this show great is not it's premise, but rather the brilliant writing. If you are a Christian, like I am, you might be offended by what the main character does. Since I don't approve of the main character's motives or actions I hope he loses in the end. So if you are a Christian then watch it from that perspective.",1221436800,,1283,4.17741935483871
2892297,5,B000T28G2S,"Honestly, this is one of the best tv series ever simply because of the mental part of it.  There isn't so much action in the sense of people fighting.  It's all about the mental warfare.  This series will keep you guessing what is going to happen inbetween each episode and as you're watching the episode itself.  This is something that everybody and anybody should watch at least once through.

The Bad Part:  It technically ended with the resolution at the end of the first ""season"".  You can tell what part I'm talking about when you see it.  Then because the fans loved it so much and they pressured him, he went about making a second ""season"".  Think of it really being two books in the set.  The second set of episodes takes some episodes to really get along.  He had to take it slow to keep the human reactions in the show realistic as opposed to them ""magically"" figuring somthing out or slipping up.  So that's it's only real downside.

There is one other part I don't particularly care for, but I can't say because it's a spoiler.  If you enjoy the series, you'll know instantly what part I mean when you see it. ;)",1219536000,,1125,4.424390243902439
2892298,5,B000T28G2S,"Like all the people that have giving good reviews, I will say that the story is great.  Most shows and movies involving mystery focus more on the investigation, but this is different.  Light Yagami wants to rid the world of evil and becomes a murderer himself.  Meanwhile, the police begin investigating Kira, due to the unusual number of heart attacks.  This show would probably be like dramatic irony more than anything else because we, the audience, know from the beginning that Light, the protagonist of this story, is the culprit.  I recommend that everyone get this series from iTunes or Direct2Drive though because Amazon has only 16 episodes for download, while iTunes and Direct2Drive have all 37 episodes.",1217635200,,715,5.02542372881356

At first, I was hesistant to watch Death Note - just because there are so many other animes out there and watching one unnecessarily would be a complete waste of time and I didn't really know too much about it. I WAS aware of the big hype for Death Note and by chance, decided to give it a try.  I'm SO in love with the series, and I'm so thankful that I didn't skip this one. Death Note has become one of my favorite animes.

There is one thing to note: I wish there weren't so many deaths (esp a particular one), although.. I guess with the name: Death Note, it's kind of inevitable.  LOL!",1215561600,5,831,4.3076923076923075

So all of those people out there who prefer the manga to the anime. I must say there really is no difference in the two mediums. Except...the ending. The ending of the anime almost made me cry. Not because it was sad but because they ruined a piece of art. In my humble opinion before you watch the last episode of the anime, buy the final manga and read the ending.

2892328,5,B000T28G2S,"Unlike anime heavy weights such as; Bleach, Naruto, Inuyasha, and Full Metal Alchemist,  Death Note brought something new to the table. Instead of big swords, too much hair gel, and busty women, Death Note has a entirely never done before story; which makes it so appealing. It has almost a Gothic feel to it that's addicting like chocolate.... (don't mind the bad comparison....!)

Death Note revolves around Seventeen year old Light Yagami; a genius, tennis star, and heartthrob. One fateful day, Light happens to pick up a black notebook off of the ground bearing the words; Death Note. Upon further inspection, Light learns that if you write a person's name in the Death Note while thinking of their face, you can kill them. Now Light, an aspiring Police/Detective officer puts away the Death Note and doesn't even think about it. Until he happens to witness a young girl being attacked by grimy men. He quickly writes the guys name, and sure enough he dies. Light is shocked, how could something like this really be true? It is true however, as Light gets an unexpected greeting by the owner of the Death Note, Ryuk, who happens to be a Shinigami. (Think something like a Grim Reaper.) Ryuk tells Light he can kill anyone, provided he follows the rules. So here history is made, as Light decides to kill of all criminals and 'evil.' He will become the God of the new world. Light dons the name 'Kira' (derived from Killer) and starts off killing criminals.

But all is not well in Light's world. The Police have noticed all of the mysterious deaths, and have now vowed to get this Kira; including the world's best detective, known simply as; L.
Will Light carry out his goal for complete dominance over the world? Or will the world's best detective, L, stop him? Your going to have to either A) Watch the Anime or B) Read the Manga.

Characterization has never been better in a Anime or Manga then it has been in Death Note. Light Yagami is characterized as an arrogant, greedy, devilishly intelligent young man who will stop at nothing to achieve his goal. You'll love to hate Light, and find later in the series how evil and maddening his character is.

L, the world's best detective, remains enigmatic for much of the first part of the series. But once his grand entrance is staged, you'll see truly grand character development.

Animation is certainly gorgeous, with a Gothic element that's hard to resist. You'll have a hard time not to drool over Light or even L later on. (Who doesn't love the fact they both don't wear hair gel....!) There's something about the stunning visuals that'll suck you right in, and certainly draw you into the world of Death Note.

Voice Acting is top notch, which is rare for an Anime. Usually you get one or two people whom or really bad, or even sometimes a completely terrible cast all together! (Think One Piece) However, Death Note is quite different indeed. Brad Swaile lends his voice for Light Yagami, and does it perfectly. His voice will send chills up your spine, in a great way. Alessandro Julliani (whom plays Felix Gaeta on Battlestar Galactica) is perfect as L. There's no way to describe how good he is. Even supporting characters voices are top notch, which truly shows that this show was made with much effort involved. The Music is really nice two, sweeping Gothic vocals in intense moments, and often complete and utter silence at shocking moments. There are four opening and closing theme songs in the entire run of the show, which are really nice to listen too.

So go ahead, try something new. There certainly aren't any; Big Swords, Hair Gel, Busty Women, or over the top Gore, but that makes Death Note even the more satisfying. It's new and fresh, and something that's never been done before. I'm glad I watched Death Note, (and I almost didn't!) and now I'm completely obsessed.

Didn't Parents always used to say, trying something new is good for you?",1214006400,,3921,4.704081632653061
2892329,5,B000T28G2S,"The manga was so great, I didn't think an anime could ever live up to it.  But after watching the first volume, it comes close.  It follows the manga pretty close, cutting off some of the less needed details for time and just gets to the point of each chapter.  This causes it to move at a faster pace than the manga in areas, which doesn't give you much time to absorb the story as I would have liked.  The animation is great, but somewhat simplified over it's manga counterpart, which is to be expected I suppose.

The voice acting isn't exactly what I would have liked.  Some of the characters, such as Light and Ryuk sound out of place, but Light's father and L sound spot on to what I imagined while reading the manga.  This is only my opinion of course, and others may have a different view on the voice for each character.

I would recommend, if possible, for people new to the series to read the manga first.  It will provide a much more in depth and detailed story.  If you are not big on reading, then the anime is a must.  Death Note is a story that's fresh and different than any thing else out there and above all, it always keeps you interested.",1211932800,,1159,4.2465753424657535

Thus opens the brilliant saga of Deathnote, one of the most compelling and amazing animes of all time. It tells the story of Light Yagami, an intelligent university student with a strong sense of justice who accidentally picks up a notebook owned by a God of Death. Slowly, he starts killing off criminals under the guise of Kira ('Killer'), becoming more and more like those who kills in the process. The storyline is incredibly amazing and faithful to the original mangas, while the artwork is absolutely perfect. And the music and English vocals are a perfect match as well. As a result, this is one of those animes that even people who normally don't like cartoons can get into.

The first four episodes, which is where you SHOULD start, introduce the protagonist of Light Yagami, as well as his rival, the great detective known only as L. L, of course, is a fan favorite (hes certainly my favorite) and the first four episodes here tell the story of Light and L.'s mind games, each trying to lure the other out into the open without revealing their own identities. The confrontation between the two, in the episode appropriately named 'Confrontation,' was one of the most defining moments of the anime. Meanwhile, Light uses his Deathnote to kill criminals and set the Japanese police against L. Very well complex storyline, but quite enjoyable.

This is easily one of the coolest animes on air right now, and well worth watching. It is the characters who really make this show good too.... L. of course, but also Ryuk, the bored God of Death who drops his Deathnote in the human world for amusement, and Light whose quest for justice steadily taints him in the process. And Misa too, but she doesn't come into the series for a while yet. Just go out and buy this DVD and I promise you won't be disappointed.

As an added bonus, the limited edition first run DVDs of the series each come boxed with a figure - in this particular case, Ryuk, the raven-like Shinigami (Death God) with a macabre sense of humor whose Deathnote Light picks up at the beginning of the story.",1211587200,,1622,4.785714285714286

2892333,5,B000T28G2S,"Because so many others have praised this so highly and so well I will not add a great deal here.  The brilliance of the show lies not in its premise, but in what it does with that after initially established.  A brilliant high school student named Light Yogami finds the Death Note, a notebook that can literally kill a person once you have entered their name in it.  Light proceeds to make the world a better place by entering the names of as many criminals as possible (though one wonders why he focuses so ardently on those who commit violent crime, when some political leaders cause far more destruction than even the worst -- it would have been interesting to see Light enter the names of Taliban leaders or the president of the US). Worldwide authorities quickly surmise that the rash of deaths of inmates in prisons (especially in Japan) due to heart attacks (the default method of death unless further specifications are made) is the work of person or persons unknown and they recruit the world's foremost investigator, known merely as L (voiced in the English language version by BATTLESTAR GALACTICA's Allesandro Juliani aka Gaeta aka Butter Fingers).  The ensuing chess match between Light, who is megalomaniacally determined to remake the world according to his personal moral standards, and L, who is determined to stop anyone striving to make themselves the world's grand executioner, provides most of the focus for this first disc in the series.  The two are constantly represented as each other's opposite, though interestingly both are seeking justice and a better world, though by different and incompatible means.

What sets DEATH NOTE above other animated series is the brilliance of the writing and its patience in exploring ideas.  This is a show of ideas and not of action.  In fact, in many episodes virtually nothing ""happens.""  Even on a visual level there are long stretches where there is little or no actual animation, but instead a ""camera"" panning over a still painting.  But the show is never, ever boring or less than fascinating.  The most fascinating moments in the show consist of the patient, methodical working out of ideas, often in conversations between Light and Ryuk, the death god from the Shinigami realm (who looks like a cross between a very small dragon and the Joker from Batman).  If the ideas permeating the show were not so fascinating, the show would indeed be dull.  As it stands, this is one of the most original, fascinating shows on TV.

I have a couple of minor quibbles with the show.  The FBI features prominently in the series.  Of course, the FBI has no jurisdiction outside the United States and would not be employed on missions in Japan.  And as I mentioned above, I think many social and political leaders do far more harm than violent criminals.  From my own perspective Jim Dobson or Karl Rove have done far more damage to the world than any bank robber.  But perhaps they realized that ridding the world of social and political leaders would have been too controversial.  It would also have been politically divisive, since one person might find George Bush to be a source of great evil while another sees him as a beacon of light.  Criminals are another matter entirely.  My other complaint is with the price of the discs.  The series as a whole is now up to 28 episodes.  At this pace a show with about the same amount of total minutes as a full season of the American TV comedy THE OFFICE will cost four times as much (after Amazon discount).  Hopefully when the series is complete and all ""volumes"" have been released they will repackage it in a more affordable form.

But these are minor quibbles beside the brilliance of the series.  I strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys intelligent, brilliant television.  If you have never watched anime before, this would be a superb place to start.  TV, let alone anime, doesn't get much better than this.",1209859200,2,3926,4.783382789317508
2892334,5,B000T28G2S,"What can I say that other reviewers have not stated already?  Deathnote is a chilling, supsenseful tale of a Japanese youth (Light Yagami) who happens upon a notebook that has the unfortunate power of killing anyone who's name is written in it.

What I love is the fact that the anime launches immediately into the action: no pussyfooting around with angst ridden teenage hopes.  Instead, Light's personal and professional character traits are placed in a background role while his Megalomania and Messiah complex are front and center for all to wonder at.

Is this what would happen if a 'good' person came upon the notebook?  Would they strike down upon criminals in order to preserve a pure world?  these are interesting questions posed by the anime.

The story is top notch, well written and the characters are works of spectacular art, especially Light, L, and Ryuk the Shinigami.  The protagonist role is played by Light, yet he never really fits into a 'hero' role.  We all empathize with him, yet when he begins to cross the line into a darker territory, all in the name of the greater good, we see that shadowy side of human nature.  Bravo!

Also, the animation is flawless.  I mean: FLAWLESS!  This is the finest example of hand drawn, computer finished animation that I have ever seen in an OAV (Paprika and Ghost in the Shell Innocence had great animation, though they were both feature length).  The movement is fluid and without annoying glitches or frame issues.

Music is key to this series, and the score suits the mood perfectly.  The haunting celestial choir is well suited to Light's Deathnote writing fits.

I am not the kind of person to watch anime on TV, I prefer to 'flix' or buy the DVDs, so I have so far only seen through Disc 3, but I cannot wait for more!

Pros: Animation, characterization, plot, originality.
Cons: Not much, the cops can be a bit corny.

The 3 live action movies out so far are just deplorable, a bit entertaining, but don't do the story justice.  The TV series?

If you loved the manga, then you'll get a kick out of seeing the memorable moments play out so beautifully.

So i'm bored and finally decide to watch this anime.  The artist has talent to start with, and Death note is very well drawn.  Which for me is a must.  I really can't watch too many animes that aren't drawn well.  (Yu Yu Hakasho, Tenchi Muyo....)  It's very suspenseful and keeps you wanting to see the next thing that's about to happen all the time.  No action like a lot of the big animes (Naruto, Bleach, Dragonball Z) but has probably one of the best storylines out there.

2892361,5,B000T28G2S,"This is one anime that is rediculously good. Death Note has an incredible power that only anime has held tightly. The power to take an insane concept and actually make it make sense. Vandread is one I can think of right off the bat. Let me explain, The Death Note is a notebook caried by creatures caled Shinigami. The shinigami are said not to be either good or evil. The impossible or the seemingly impossible is the death note's poweres and how to make a story out of this. Light Yagami finds the Death Note one day lying on the ground.

Light is at the top of his class, the son of a great detective, and is going to be going to college soon. When he touches the Death Note he see's the previous owner, the shinigami named Ryuk . This shinigami is not so soft on the eyes but despite this Light gets used to Ryuk very quickly. Light finds that the Death Note can be used to kill people. If you write the name of the person with his/her face in mind, the person will die. If the cause of death is unspecified then the person will die of a heart attack.

Light comes to the conclusion to use this newfound power to eliminate evil people in the world. He goes after people in prison, people suspected of criminal acts that he believes are guilty, and though he does not blieve in killing the innocent he will kill whoever tries to get in his way. Somehow by a crazy hunch, the police figure that someone is doing this. They do not believe that all these criminals are dieing from heart attacks just by chance. Honestly the police would never have a chance at even getting a thoght of who was doing this. Then a new character is introduced. His name is simply L, L is an amazing detective and seems to be just as smart if not smarter than Light and he gives him some competition. This guy will definitely remind you of Monk.

I believe that Death Note was very well written. For one, the entire plot sound crazy and impossible but they make it cool and real with the adition of good characters. L gives the show exactly what it needs and so does the shinigami Ryuk. Just when you think you know,you have no idea and the carpet is pulled from under you. Light is a great main character and the battle to come from him and L will make this series exciting. The animation is incredible and fits perfectly. Great color and light and a great usage of darkness to give a gloomy feel to it. The voice actors are hot and the soundtrack adds an edge.

2892362,5,B000T28G2S,"I stumbled across this completely backwards - first via the live action movies, then the manga, and finally the Anime which was just releasing the English dubbed version of this.

It is NOT for children, however.  Perhaps older teenagers that are more mentally mature than their peers.  It has already been banned in China because of younger teenagers buying Cosplay copies of Death Notes and listing the names of disliked teachers, school-mates, and parents that they would like to drop dead with a certain savage glee.

He tests the book out eventually, and realizes that it does, indeed kill people. He then eventually meets up with the ""Shinigami"" (Death God/Grim Reaper) who owns the book, and ends up having the Shinigami follow him around constantly. (Nobody else can see Ryuk)

Eventually, the CIA and Japanese police force start to get suspicious of the heart attacks happening to already criminals and try to find out who is doing all this. They bring in L who is known as a master mind at finding out who the murderers are who committed an act of crime.

Give Death Note a chance, and watch it on Adult Swim if you want to see what it's like at first. I love this series, the animation is beautiful, and not ""goofy"" looking at all.

And, if you like Dexter, I would think you would like this series as well.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dexter-The-First-Season/dp/B000Q6GUW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dexter - The First Season</a>",1198195200,,1430,4.800813008130081
2892364,5,B000T28G2S,"This series is the best anime I've ever seen (and the best manga series I've ever read), and the DVD was quite enjoyable - but don't be fooled by Amazon, as this does NOT have 8 episodes, but only 4. The only complaint I really have about it is that I expected the ""Interview with Voice Actors"" to be more than just the director and the man who played Light. Oh well, maybe more will be on the second DVD...

I've been obsessed with this series since I saw it in May of this year (2007), and I was nearly hyperventilating when it came out in English on Adult Swim. Sure, the Japanese version is cool, but the the English dub isn't as bad as others make it out to be. It does take a bit to get used to Light's voice, and I never expected L to be given a British accent, but it's nonetheless amazing! I must add that I think Ryuk got the perfect voice - deep and demonic (and, personally, sexy) with a cackle to give the Japanese voice actor a run for his money. The dubbed version is very good; I've heard much worse dubs before, so don't just dismiss it because it's dubbed!

The Ryuk figurine that comes with this particular package is really cool looking and very detailed. However, mine somehow got a little extra black paint on the forehead, but other than that, it's looks beautiful. <3",1197072000,,1291,4.26530612244898
2892365,5,B000T28G2S,"...enjoy this amazing series with JAPANESE audio with subtitles ON.  The Japanese voice acting is FANTASTIC (even if know zero Japanese) and the English dubs are below average for anime (which is already not so good).

With that in mind, Death Note is arguably one of the best anime series ever made.  Go buy/watch it!",1196294400,6,318,4.745454545454545
2892366,5,B000T28G2S,"I am finally happy to see this anime coming to the stateside. I'm a huge fan of the manga and I am happy to see that they are staying true to the manga. The story is the best I've read and I am just very happy they didn't alter it like some other great manga turned bad anime (mostly like Gantz, the ending was just very bad). A great buy for any manga/anime fans!",1196208000,,364,3.9324324324324325
2892387,3,B000T28G2S,"Negative points
- It only contains the first 4 episodes, not 8 as mentioned
- The is NO second dvd as mentioned, and the extras aren't that good...
- The english voice over is just plain awefull, the voices for Yagumi, Ryuk and L ... just horrible in english

Positive points
- The figure is just great, the details are awesome
- The box art and included landscape to put behind the figure are great
- Original japanese voices with good english subtitles
- The dvd packaging is amazing as well",1196121600,,493,4.417582417582418

I was very pleased witht he DVD. I love how they have some nice special features like commentry with the director for episode 1, behind the scenes english voice actor interviews nd recording sessions, production art and as well as clean opening and ending. I really say the price is worth everything. I am going to be buying the rest of the volumes when they come out asap.

2892389,4,B000T28G2S,"I just got this DVD a few days ago at FYE(it came with a mini flashlight keychain that flashes the ""L"" when you light it up-I think it cooler than the figurine being offered at most places).  The DVD has 4 episodes-NOT the 8 that amazon advertises.  The DVD extras include the english actors interviews and recording sessions and theres director commentary-a bunch of boring stuff mostly.  If you've read the manga and enjoyed it you'll be happy to know that the anime has stayed true to story-unlike the live action movie.  The english voice acting is good overall-nothing to get to excited about, and the art itself isn't wow but its not cheap either-takes after the book art.",1194998400,2,678,4.6722689075630255
2892390,5,B000T28G2S,"Superb psychological thriller.
Brilliant but insane college student Light Yagami begins a deadly game of cat and mouse with a mysterious detective when the 'Death Note'-a powerful instrument of destruction from the Gods-falls into the wrong hands. Light decides to create a 'Perfect World' where he alone decides who lives and dies, and as the criminals of the world begin dropping dead a quirky but renowned detective known only as 'L' begins to close in on the killer...and a stunning battle of wits ensues. Gorgeous animation curtesy of Studio Madhouse (X/1999, Gunslinger Girl), incredibly beautiful music, edge-of-your-seat action, and some surprisingly emotive moments Death Note is instantly a modern classic.
A quick note on the english dub-from what I've seen so far (2 epsiodes) it is SUPERB-L's VA is the furthest cry from his japanese counterpart yet manages to make the role entirely his own in a sophisticated, smooth, performance with just a hint of british accent. Brian Drummond's Ryuk sounds so brilliantly creepy-just like the original-that when they cackle evilly you can barely hear any difference. Probably of most importance, while Brad Swaille sounds vocally like Mamoru Miyano's english speaking twin, he just cannot hit the right note of emotion and tenderness that was in Miyano's Light Yagami. For me, listening to that beautifully gentle yet cold voice while watching Light's descent into madness was inescapebly one of the most effective things about Death Note, and his performance especially in the final epsiode sounded so emotionally realistic and harrowing it brought me to tears. Amazing stuff, and because of this I will always favour the sub-though I may flick over to listen to L once in a while :3 Give both language tracks a try since this is a series blessed with above-par actors in both.
Easily the most amazing anime I've seen in years, it will have its hooks in you from the first episode until the perfect finale. Don't miss it this november.",1194307200,2,1989,5.104294478527607

It is still a decent price though.",1194134400,5,343,4.396825396825397

Not only is the plot interesting and new, but the tension created by the battle between L and Light could be cut with a knife. Although it drags a tad towards the ending, this is a series that should not be missed! Plus, you'll get to listen to awesome J-rock band Nightmare who do the opening and closing songs.",1194048000,,437,4.0344827586206895
2892394,5,B000T28G2S,"A must see for all anime fans. A good psychological thriller/ cat and mouse game between two masterminds. Each episode gets you more and more addicted to the show. The characters are more dimensional than any other series or movie that I have seen. Once I started watching, I could not pull myself away- it's just that addictive.

Both the animation and music are pretty average - not the best I've ever seen, but by far not the worst either. It's the story that really drives this series. I won't summarize it for you, Amazon does a pretty good job of that. And besides, anymore would just give away too much. If you need a preview, Adult Swim on Cartoon Network has started airing the series and even has full episodes on their website. It's dubbed, but atleast it will give you enough of a taste to see if you like it or not.

It's for a more mature crowd (I'd say 15+). The theme is death, but there's no especially gory scenes. There are many twists and turns that will keep you guessing till the end. The series is.. ""how you say..'juicy'"".",1193356800,6,1046,4.414507772020725
2892395,5,B000T28G2S,"Anyone not familiar with Death Note should be. By any standard, whether you're an anime fan or not, Death Note is a brilliantly written, 100-mph morality tale that not only delivers on suspense and thrills, but carries a great philosophical question with it. It gets you thinking, and on deep levels too. But the true gem of this piece is the battle of wits between it's two leads. Watching them outsmart each other is the best part, as you never know what to expect. Every tiny thing becomes important and you just don't want to stop finding out what's going to come next. The series is, in a word brilliant and should be witnessed by everyone, not just anime fans, but anyone looking for a good story. Get Death Note and start reading/watching. You won't be disappointed, I guarantee.",1193097600,3,786,4.661870503597123
2892396,5,B000T28G2S,"Death Note is truly the best adult anime, period.  I say adult, because the story line is mature and complex.  I do not think children under the age of 13 will get any of what is going on.  The action is limited, but the dialog and writing is truly a piece of work.  You won't find sex scenes or excessive violence, but if you enjoy a unique, well written story that forces you to watch episode after episode to see what happens next, then Death Note will not disappoint.

Buy it, love it.",1193097600,7,489,4.21505376344086
