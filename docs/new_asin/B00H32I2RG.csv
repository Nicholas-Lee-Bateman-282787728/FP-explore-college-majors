8629376,5,B00H32I2RG,"I found the NavaBlast workout a good way to get started. It has a good warm up to get your ready for the exercises. Once you're warmed up, there are 2 circuits to complete with four different exercises. You don't need any equipment, even though the trainer uses a stepper. Its your choice. Really a good introduction to circuit training that is great for beginners.

The Interval and Leg workout is intense. The trainers in the video are breathing hard, so you know this is real. This workout is really a full-body workout. You'll get cardio, strength and core training in this one workout. Definitely a good complement to the NavaBlast workout.",1389744000,,645,4.758928571428571
