7957721,4,B000062XEN,"Comment about the movie ""The Vicious Circle"" (El Circulo Vicioso) 2003 written and directed by Nelson Pea.

It's the first dominican movie that covers a reality of the dominicans from a very serious point of view.  After listening the commentaries by the most highly positioned dominican movie critics, Armando Almanzar and Arturo Rodriguez, I decide to buy this movie, and though it's not in DVD format, but VHS, I bought it, watched, and enjoyed fully.

This is a magnificent approach to the reality of a segment of the Dominican Republic citizens that without any resources decide to go to the United States, and try to conquer a piece of the American Dream, but in a sick way taking the easiest and quickly road to it, selling drugs, and if they need killing other human beings.

It's the best dominican movie so far.  It's the only one that treats the characters from a serious point of view.
