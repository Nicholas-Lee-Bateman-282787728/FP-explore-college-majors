7821007,5,6302101344,"Released in 1987, Three for the Road stars Charlie Sheen & Alan Ruck as an ambitious political aide and his best friend assigned to delivering a senator's rebellious daughter to a reform institution down south (Kerri Green). The 16 year-old just wants to see her mother whom she hasn't seen in eight years (Sally Kellerman). Blair Tefkin plays a southern gal who hooks up with the trio while Raymond J. Barry plays the teenagers father, a pompous senator.

Like my title blurb says, this is just a fun 80s road flick that hits all the check boxes: Great cast, characters you care about, entertaining situations and antics on the road, a fitting 80s soundtrack, a satisfying conclusion and quality women. As far as that last one goes, Kerri was 19 during filming, which qualifies for a woman, and Blairs just an all-around whoa-man, not to mention Kellerman. Lastly, the movie doesnt wear out its welcome at a mere 88 minutes. For all these reasons, Three for the Road breaks the threshold of greatness, as far as amusing road flicks go.

The film was shot in Hot Springs and Little Rock, Arkansas, and is still not available on DVD as of this writing, although it's available on VHS here (via sellers).

7821009,5,6302101344,"I seen this movie a long time ago and happen to think how i would love to see it again. I was hoping for it to be on DVD but sadly it isn't, I recently purchased a new vhs movie because it had never went to DVD. Sorry to say the quality of today and the DVD's it was not as nice and I paid just as much, I was very disappointed, Even though there are some around on VHS I wouldn't buy one as the picture actually looks like one I taped years ago from the tv onto my own blank vhs tapes. Maybe someday the powers that be will get smart and get these good  funny films on DVD's so I will wait!",1296172800,2,591,3.728
