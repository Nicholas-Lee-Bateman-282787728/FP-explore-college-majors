780228,4,6304079907,"The story itself is rather ordinary for a gay film, but the fact that it was done at all in 1973 is extraordinary.  And the film captures the time and place very well.  It is quite well-acted, with the late Robert Joel playing an former monk who decides to find love and commitment in New York City.  But finding the love he longs for turns out to be more complicated than he imagined.  This is a real blast from the past, before the days of gym-toned bodies, when guys were still wearing shag haircuts.  A must view for fans of gay cinema.",1112486400,8,540,4.254901960784314
780229,5,6304079907,"This is a film with extraordinary vision as it was way ahead of its time. 1973... the gay rights movement that started at Stonewall was only 4 years old. Gays, in general, were still mostly ""closeted"" with their own underground society. Psychologists had just a few years earlier declared homosexuality not to be a personality disorder. Homosexuality as a topic for discussion was a new frontier for most Americans.... So here comes a film depicting gay men in an in-depth way involving their feelings, their relationships, their social interactions- full frontal nudity- and prophetically, the main character, David, as a priest who leaves the church after coming to terms with his sexuality. All ""taboo"" subjects in mainstream America involved at the time with Richard Nixon and the Watergate hearings. It is amazing that this film was made in 1973 and that the producers were able to get actors with the courage to participate in the making of such a film.
The storyline, in a nutshell, shows David wanting to commit to Mark. Mark does, hesitantly, due to his commitment-phobia and having a different value system, which finally drives a wedge between them and ends the relationship. David goes through the emotional ringer and then meets Jason. Jason wants to commit after a time, but David has become jaded about relationships- and commitment-phobic- and doesn't want anything more from Jason than a relationship where they just ""want to be together. In a sense, David evolves into a ""Mark,"" and Jason comes along as the new ""David"" about to get the same treatment that David originally did.
I liken A Very Natural Thing"" to be a primitive ""All Over The Guy."" The story shows a vicious cycle about relationships that both gay and straight people can relate to and presents some universal truths about how gays feel about themselves being a minority group and their self-destructive tendencies due to limitations society puts on them. These are circumstance that are still very relevant today.
The ending of the film is very open-ended and doesn't resolve any of the issues the movie brings up as there are no answers for the questions this film raises. That is actually what gives the film relevancy today given the current debate on same-sex marriage (especially with the flick's marriage scene), which has the potential of breaking the ""glass ceiling"" on the limitations of how gay relationships can evolve and how gays can feel about themselves.
Ok! The hair styles and clothes are dated, but it's not too hard to get past. Just concentrate on the characters and the storyline/dialogue in relation to the plots you see in most current films and today's current events and this film will feel as relevant and ""run-of-the-mill"" as any film made in 2003, but very ""visionary"" and ""ground-breaking"" for 1973!",1081641600,16,2812,4.997867803837953
780230,5,6304079907,"1974 was an interesting year: President Richard M. Nixon imposed national 55 mph speed limits, he later resigned his presidency over the Watergate scandal, Turkey invaded Cyprus, Scelbi Computer Consulting was the first company ever to advertise a personal computer (the Scelbi), and Christopher Larkin produced, directed and wrote his only film, a groundbreaking & controversial film entitled ""A Very Natural Thing"".  This film is regarded by many to be first widely distributed mainstream film to depict gay men honestly.  Taking place primarily in NYC, ""A Very Natural Thing"" focuses on the life of David (Robert Joel), a gay man who is forced to leave the priesthood over his sexuality. One night at a bar with his friend Alan (Jay Pierce), he meets Mark (Curt Gareth).  A romance develops between David and Mark, but problems develop because of their different views of what a committed relationship should be.  David later meets Jason (Bo White, also known for his portrayal of Adam in the 1974 film ""Bible!"") during a gay pride march, but the emotional problems that David had with Mark could hamper a relationship between them.
At only 80 minutes, ""A Very Natural Thing"" may seem short, but the story portrayed is just as meaningful now as it was in 1974. Were it not for the mid-1970's fashions and hairstyles (which some may find dated), you might think you were watching a contemporary film.  Picture quality is not great since the film was shot on a low budget, but I have seen several contemporary independent films with much worse quality.  Aside from that, there are many memorable scenes in in the film including seeing David & Mark rolling down a hill together in Central Park and seeing David & Jason rollicking in the ocean on the shore of Cape Cod.  The most controversial scenes in the film for 1974 are the love scenes between naked men.
Certainly, the film is not flawless, but for 1974 this was a groundbreaking film that clearly demonstrated what a film about gay characters could be.  For that reason, and for being an engaging film, I give this film a rating of 5 stars.  If you decide not to purchase a copy of the film, I highly recommend renting it to see it at least once.",1042675200,24,2203,4.761154855643045
780231,4,6304079907,"Despite many technical shortcomings (fuzzy sound, poor lighting, sloppy editing, weak script --so what's left, right?) this is a pioneering piece of gay Americana. Plot may seem irritatingly superficial by today's standards (what with QAF) but we must remember there were no other films of this type --none-- when this was shot. Same gender relationships were quite unspoken subjects in the 1970's and the fact the film deals with them --at all-- is its strongest asset. See it for the slice of history that it is. And be grateful, very grateful, someone back then had the guts to do it.",1036454400,10,587,4.88
780232,2,6304079907,"I'm not going to go into the sound/quality/ issues on this movie because it is an old film.  I did enjoy certain parts of the movie. Basically the main character, leaves the priesthood, becomes a teacher and starts dating a nice looking Ad exec.  They move in together under pressure from the teacher.  The Ad man cheats on him and tries to get him to participate in orgies ect... They end up breaking up.  Then the teacher meets a guy much more similar in his wants and ideas.  However, now he basically tells the new guy, no I made the mistake of trying to be in a monogomous relationship and it was all my fault we broke up because I was unrealistic ect... so lets just live this one for the moment.  I found this a bit difficult to believe.  Most of the time when people break up they know it is because there was a problem, an obstacle ect.. in this film the character basically changes entirely what he wants and believes based on a single break up even the most self hating guy isn't going to completely change his thought process just because he things didn't work out with one guy.  Here is an idea, go out and find a guy you click with a bit better.  I didn't find it realistic and think it was more a chance for the filmaker to make a movie supporting his ideas on relationships.  Still It was very nice to see that such a film was made so long ago and as a look at the history of gay film it is very nice.",1005177600,3,1417,4.157509157509158
780233,2,6304079907,"Sadly, this groundbreaking film has not aged well, and is now more a historical artifact than a compelling drama.  The plot is fairly simple: Boy meets Boi; Boy and Boi try to copy hetero marriage; Boy dumps Boi over  infidelity; Boy gets liberated; Boy meets Boi2; Boy and Boi2 find happiness  by rejecting hetero values.  Quite daring for its time (and tremendously  affirming for Gay men trying to adjust to life  post-Stonewall), the film  now seems archaic when viewed through a modern Gay sensibility defined by  current issues such as civil unions, domestic partnerships, adoption  rights, hate crimes and safer sex.
The film's production values are also  outdated. The DVD is grainy, with poor color balance and often muffled  sound ... which is not the fault of the DVD producers, but rather reflects  the financial constraints often faced by pioneering Gay filmmakers of the  period.  Compare this movie with more recent Gay-themed releases like  ""Trick"", ""Jeffrey"" or even TV shows like ""Will  & Grace"" ... we've come a long way on both sides of the camera (as  filmmakers and as a commercially viable audience), and that's a very good  thing!  Deserving of respect as a Gay cinematic milestone, but pretty  rough-going for anyone seeking pure entertainment.",963273600,47,1269,5.067961165048544
780234,4,6304079907,"Technical stuff out of the way - this is a movie made in the 70's, with no restoration for DVD, so it, well, looks like an old movie. Grainy and some bad colors.  Plus, it was made at a time when 'gay pride' was new, so there  are some 'man on the street' interviews form a pride celebration which have  nothing to do with the movie.
The story is timeless though.  It's the  constant 'gay' struggle of sex vs love.  Our hero tried to make a  relationship with someone who isn't sure he wants love, but is our hero too  interested in a domestic life and canot see the forest for the trees?  I  think this is a subject ALL of us go through as we search for relationships  in our lives.  This movie could be made today and the storyline would be  exactly the same.  This is a definite rent for any gay man, or anyone who  wants to see that gays really don't lead a life of only sex...",949276800,73,881,4.0701754385964914

It's a love story which, despite a few muddy camera effects,  unfolds seamlessly. The  complexities of the relationship between the ex-priest and his two lovers  are clearly defined, despite dialog that sounds, well, like it came from  the 1970's. Oh well. The film does have an enchanting combination of  innocence and lust. There's a good side story with bisexual tones which  adds an air of avant-garde to the mix. An excellent date movie.

780525,4,6304079907,"""A Very Natural Thing"" is a terrific snapshot of contemporary gay life, as it existed in the mid 1970s. The film maker's style is pseudo docudrama, intertwining real footage of things like protests and street interviews, with genuinely good acting. It's a simple story line: gays meet in a bar and hook up, spend time together and fall in love. As the relationship ensues there's issues of sexual boredom, they try sex with others including the popular orgies of the time, but they remain committed to each other. The cruising scenes on locations like bath houses and Fire Island are great - there's even some full frontal nudity. It's a traditional love story, combined with societal pressures for gay rights, open sex prevalent in this pre-HIV period of gay culture. Although the film is now over 40 years old (the garb, hair styles and lots of zits the give-away), the concept remains current and  a great choice for a gay couple's Friday night dick flick.",1455580800,,959,4.8121212121212125

It feels real.

This Relationships story is as relevant today as it was 41+ years ago.  Sit back, watch at your own pace, and enjoy the fact that fundamentally little has changed in the world of confusing relationships.

You will likely identify with at least one of the main characters ... if not each and every one of them as they explain their perspectives and personal points of view.  Fashion can't change the fact that this really is something unique - forget the big hair and everything else associated with the '70s.

What this film shares regarding relationships is all still very relevant today.

When this film was first released, this was truly a ground-breaking film.  (And by the way : much better quality story line and almost everything else than 90% of the more recent releases.)

780710,5,6304079907,"""A Very Natural Thing"" is an important early gay film by a gay man documenting the gay scene of its time (early to mid 1970's). The documentary interviews are not as integral a part of the film as the director apparently thought, but that may be more apparent due to the passage of time since its release (1974). the human story told by the film comes out in the interaction of the characters as they search for what they want in life. The lesson of the film seems to be that at different portions of your life you want different things in your life. I don't know that I COMPLETELY agree with this view, but that seems to be what the story tells the viewer.

Now the problems:
1) The packaging & the info from IMDB / Amazon get the basic plot & identities wrong. In reality, the monk / schoolteacher is named David (not Jason), the advertising executive is named Mark (not David), & the photographer  is named Jason. The official info says that the teacher & the ad executive learn to respect & love each other: in the film, however, they can't live with each other, and end up breaking up because living together causes too many problems and winds up being psychically toxic for the teacher. After that (& after giving up on trying to fix the relationship with the ad exec), the teacher meets / gets together with the photographer (who is not even mentioned in the official summation). He is this time reluctant to jump into a commitment with guy he's with, while leaving that possibility for the future (& admitting that it would be a possibility).
2) The bathhouse scenes are visually pretty dim, & it is sometimes difficult to tell what's going on. That may be realistic and true to fact of the actual reality of the time, but it makes for difficult viewing. Since this is a psychically ""dark"" part of the plot, however, so it may help for it to have been filmed in dim light.

In spite of the problems listed, the plot of the actual story still holds together to give some cautionary lessons: make sure where you stand before you commit to a relationship (& as best as possible, that you are both defining the relationship the same way), then work on problems TOGETHER as they come up after you commit to be with each other so that your life situation doesn't end up becoming psychically toxic for you. From my experience, that lesson is vital for all human sexual relationships, gay or straight!",1383177600,4,2401,4.502293577981652

780712,3,6304079907,"By 1973, I had developed 3 strong friendships with gay friends I had met in college. Now in my junior year in college, Dennis, Steve and I went to see ""A Very Natural Thing"" at one of the mainstream theaters. (You would think I could remember the name of the movie theater, but, I cannot seem to remember. Was it the Alhambra, or was it as bold as The Castro? Unfortunately, I cannot remember). At that time, we were just beginning to develop long term relationships. 3 years later, at 22, I would become involved in my first tragic, long term relationship. Prior to that, if a one night stand stretched over a few days, that was indicative of how volatile long term relationships felt. In honesty, a few gay men and lesbian women had already forged long term relationships. But they were far and few between.
So ""A Very Natural Thing"" offered the possibility, of possibility. Being a child of a devout catholic home, the monastery aspect of the film resonated somewhat.
But in the ""candy store days"" of the early 70s, the search for the right partner also conflicted with raging hormones that bred a high sexual drive challenging the possibilities of monogamy.
Like some of the more tragic homosexual/lesbian stories of the 40s and 50s, while there were no suicides or untimely death, there was a lingering sadness over the quest for monogamy..........a quest that seemed increasingly difficult to fulfill.
The script was barely passable. The acting stiff and fairly uninvolving. But still, there were images of gay people that were not tragic disciples, but, gay men bravely pursuing some sense of consistency in their relationships that society was still very much against at the time.
""A Very Natural Thing"" does not age well. I saw it a few decades ago and even in the 80s when VCRs brought many long unseen movies into our homes again, it felt a little ridiculous and corny even then.
It became an inside, running joke by Dennis, Steve and myself of the prototypical long journey gay cinema would need to travel before ""Brokeback Mountain"" became an Academy Award nominated Best Picture in 2006.
At best, ""A Very Natural Thing"" is quaint and an ode to how much more growth gay cinema would experience over the next 4 decades.",1342483200,,2231,4.752577319587629
780713,5,6304079907,"I don't know what the reviewer ""Gordon Larko"" is smoking. For some reason, he feels compelled to leave the EXACT SAME horrible review and 1 STAR rating for all GAY-THEMED movies. Probably a ""personal problem"" of his. Hopefully this review will help correct this imbalance. I can't believe AMAZON is allowing this GAY BASHER to use their website as a venue to spread his hate.
By the way, This is an absolutely WONDERFUL movie!",1236038400,5,426,4.77027027027027
780714,4,6304079907,"After the shrill campiness of the movie adaptation of 1970's ""The Boys in the Band"" (which had the characters tearing each other down during the bulk of its running time), along came this more gentler study of gay life in 1973. This is probably the first mainstream film to deal honestly with gay love, friendship & relationships.
The story centers on Jason, who has just left the priesthood because he couldn't balance his devotion to God with his sexuality. Moving to New York, he becomes a school teacher, quietly living out his life, and soon meets the handsome David at a gay bar. Delving into a passionate love affair & soon living together, time wears on. Later, the differences between the two men become more glaringly apparent: David is more casual & liberated, while Jason is intensely romantic & monogamous. David's discreet infidelities and their agreement to experiment to ""spice things up"" in their relationship succeed in undermining their stability, and they break up.
Shortly after some quiet soul searching, Jason attends the local Gay Pride Festival & meets another handsome man, who has declared his homosexuality & emerged from a dissolved straight marriage. Once again, Jason delves into another passionate affair, but he is wiser this time around: He tells the man to just take things slow & simply enjoy each other's company. Jason assures him that this decision does not mean he likes him any less.
A rather dated film in its depiction of bad hair, bad clothing, and bad disco music (which, in respect, it's powerless to change), AVNT manages to address some very real issues in relationships. Such issues are people's tendencies to expect ""the perfect love"" or the disillusionment that the other person can conform to our expectations.
Some viewers might find the insertions of interviews with gays & lesbians during the Pride Fest to be an intrusive element to the story. I was slightly annoyed of the interruption, but also found the atmosphere functioning as an important time capsule of the earlier days of gay rights movements.
The slow motion climax of the two lovers frollicking nude in the beach waves was sweetly moving, a symbol of them revelling in love & freedom.
I was disappointed there were no extras; even an interview with filmmaker Christopher Larkin would've been nice.
Although the film is not exactly superior in its cinematic scope, and has some rather stilted 70's dialogue, it is honest & often moving.",1231804800,4,2453,4.985365853658537
780715,4,6304079907,This movie has actual footage and interviews filmed at the 1973 Gay Pride/Christopher Street West footage. It also has footage filmed inside the Club Baths and the disco Sanctuary.,1227312000,,180,5.241379310344827
780716,3,6304079907,"For the era in which this film was made, it is one I would consider pretty good overall, but by today's standards, It is not something I really want to watch again. It is a rather confusing story and doesn't deliver on the promises it's description would imply. Perhaps a second viewing would fill in some gaps and shed a little more light on some of this. The acting is alright, but could be better. The content is disappointing and the lighting throughout is not very good. It does have a few high spots and the actors aren't bad looking, and the ending IS surprisingly pretty good. I was not impressed real well with the casting on this one, and felt they could have found better people to fit many of the parts. It does deliver a little nudity which gives it more appeal, but also done tastefully as not to turn the film into a porn flick. It starts out with a whole lot more appeal than it ends with, and kinda loses steam as it goes along. This is an openly exposed look at some of the difficulties of the gay life, and finding love, versus shallow sexual fulfillment. It is also a historic look back at gay life in the 1970's which exposes a few differences to gay life today and how much it has changed. It does have some fun and entertaining moments here and there, especially in the ending. I would have to say I really do like this film up to a certain point, but there's just something missing that makes it a little disappointing as well. In it's time, this film was probably satisfying to it's audience, but I think maybe it's time is too long gone, and we've progressed today to much better films, which puts this one in it's own little time capsule, making it more suitable for history, than entertainment. I'll give it one thumb up and rate it with three stars, but I honestly wouldn't recommend buying it unless you just can't find anything else. If you're looking for something special about this being the ""25th Anniversary Edition"", you can stop looking. It is different from the original only in format as it is now on DVD. I found nothing else about it to differentiate it from the original release. Pretty good, but pretty disappointing overall.",1179360000,,2169,4.465994962216625
