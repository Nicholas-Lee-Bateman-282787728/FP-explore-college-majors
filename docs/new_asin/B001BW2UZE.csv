3499633,5,B001BW2UZE,I am now 68 and this is the tape I've used for the past few decades!  Sometimes I get tired of the music and chatter and just mute the sound and look at the screen.  (I know it by heart anyway.)  Some day I'm going to try to get the tape transferred to a DVD.  It's a great tape for seniors!,1302912000,,291,3.721311475409836
3499634,5,B001BW2UZE,"The product was great. I only think people over 50 would be interested in it, but it is fun and easy to do.  That was the reason I was looking for it on Amazon and as usual Amazon did not disappoint me it was available. Thank you!",1297987200,,230,3.893617021276596
3499635,5,B001BW2UZE,This is my favourite exercise video. I have used it off and on for about 20/25 years.  The pace is such that almost anyone can do it.  Just wish I could find it in DVD.,1258848000,3,168,3.7714285714285714
3499636,5,B001BW2UZE,"My mother and I used this tape when I was a child every evening after dinner.  Unfortunately, our VCR ate the tape.  I can't believe that years later I found the tape again on Amazon!

The tape is wonderful!  There are three levels that progressively get more difficult.  It's a great way to fit 30 min. of exercise into your busy schedule.",1206576000,6,340,4.419354838709677

3499638,5,B001BW2UZE,"OLDIE BUT GOODIE!! I owned this tape years ago when my children were small. I wore mine out. I was tickled to find another copy. I just wish I could get it on DVD as the program is timeless! I do well with it, I lost 70 pounds last time, using this program along with dieting. I am already losing again, this time. The moves are not difficult and most anyone can do it. By the end of the tape you can tell your whole body has had a workout!",1378166400,2,440,3.9
3499639,5,B001BW2UZE,"Was glad to find this VHS at a reasonable price.  Had to have it, now I just need to use it.  Product was received as listed great transaction.  Thanks.",1376352000,,152,4.172413793103448
3499640,5,B001BW2UZE,"I'm an historian who likes to collect things from the past and exercise videos are no different. This is decidedly not P90X or any of its like brethren, it resembles a dance/calisthenics/Pilates style exercise regime.

A series of 3 exercise routines that progress in intensity. The routines are surprisingly good and I will add it to my rotation of videos on occasion.

The best part though is to watch so many Golden Era Hollywood stars on one exercise video. Debbie Reynolds is full of humor and good cheer and the peanut gallery in the back is hysterical! A great piece of American history as well as a pretty good exercise video.",1373500800,2,634,4.702702702702703
3499641,5,B001BW2UZE,This tape is great for every section of your body that you want to improve.  The music is great and brings back memories.,1364601600,,121,4.260869565217392

find this tape, which she uses about 3 or 4 times per week.  thank you for the help and the fast service.",1346716800,,237,4.130434782608695
3499644,5,B001BW2UZE,I had this video previously and lost it.  Glad I could find a replacement.  Uniquely great for senior citizens but good enough to challenge younger generations.,1345161600,,160,5.115384615384615
3499645,5,B001BW2UZE,"I started this video because I love to work out to videos from the past. What I liked about this video was it had me hoping that if I took care of myself and did these workouts maybe I could look like Debbie when I get her age. I also liked the different music which was from the swing era. The moves are slow and controlled and allows you to focus on being your own personal best. The video also has a lot of stars in it. My favorite ones are Teri Garr and Shelly Winters. Shelly Winters is a lot of fun and makes me laugh as she jokes around about herself working out with the other fit ladies of the screen. It makes me feel good about me, just being me.  I love this one. Did I mention, it has a segment that I love to do for my butt. I can see results while getting fitter and having fun.",1332720000,2,793,3.8950617283950617
3499646,5,B001BW2UZE,I had this video VHS for YEARS and love it!! It's such a great way to exercise as Debbie uses humor along the way.  We bought a new tv.. no VHS so I gave this away to a thrift store.  The exercises are great way to start the day.  Please find a way to get this into DVD format just like alot of those old movies.  I'm sure they would sell like hot cakes..or should I say water on a hot day in Texas.  :),1312070400,,403,3.6941176470588237

8284983,1,B001BW2UZE,Had this tape when it first came out years ago. Good for people just getting back into excerise. So I went on Amazon  I had type Debbie Reynolds exercise DVD .  Didn't realize a VHS came up. Really who has a VHS now a days.  So waste of money and what  would be the point of sending back and paying for shipping. However if you don't mind a VHS the seller set it out immediately.,1405296000,,379,4.013333333333334
