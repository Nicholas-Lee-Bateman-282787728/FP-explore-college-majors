2399077,5,B000B1DSP2,"Peppermint Candy truly is an amazing film. Poignant in its depiction of the hard life of the lead character, it is a truly moving and interesting film. The acting is outstanding from all of the actors, with an especially beautiful and moving performance by the lead character, who truly experiences a wide array of emotions throughout the twenty years of his life that the film depicts.

As well, this DVD is truly a great release. The quality of the image is very clear and much nicer than some other American releases of Korean films. I would rank the image quality as being close to the wonderful presentations of the American releases of the Korean films Tae Guk Gi as well as Untold Scandal.

I highly recommend others to see this film and hope that it eventually gets much more exposure - something that it rightfully deserves.",1130457600,16,833,4.698630136986301
2399078,4,B000B1DSP2,"This is a very poignant movie about a man's loss of his innocence as the movie works backwards from end to beginning. I wouldn't exactly call it a Korean ""Memento"" because the structure is not used as a gimmick to keep the audience watching the film. However, the audience methodically gets to see where it all went wrong as the main character slowly loses his humanity over twenty years of his life.",1127088000,9,400,4.569444444444445

2399100,4,B000B1DSP2,"It was emotionally powerful and hard to watch in places.  Korean movies are often overwrought, but Im glad I sat through this one.  Some historical events from Koreas recent past (the Gwangju massacre for example) and how they shaped the life of the movies protagonist were particularly interesting to me,

Another enjoyable feature was how the movie started out showing one messed up individual and then went back in time to show how he became so deranged.  A train was utilized as a recurring theme throughout the movie and served as a makeshift time machine to carry the story backwards as it were.

Anyway, it was well-made, powerful, and sad.  Which is what a Korean movie ought to be. Give it a watch and see for yourself.",1440115200,3,728,4.692913385826771

2399102,5,B000B1DSP2,"Peppermint Candy tells personal history of a man whose troubled experiences leave him greatly disturbed. It stars Sol Kyung-Gu,Moon So- Ri,Kim Yeo-Jin,Ko Seo-Hee and Seo Jung. The movie starts with the suicide of the protagonist and uses reverse chronology to depict some of the key events of the past 20 years of his life that led to his death.

Peppermint Candy starts in the spring of 1999. A group of old friends gather to celebrate their 20 year reunion. Among the group is Yeong-ho, a cold, unhappy man, whose demeanor puts a damper on the festivities. The seriousness of Yeong-ho's depression becomes apparent, however, when he climbs a railroad bridge and looks like he might jump. At this crucial moment, memories of seven crucial episodes from Yeong-ho''s past flood his mind.

When the Peppermint Candy started with the lead protagonist killing himself,Director Lee Chang-Dong made it a point that this film is not for entertainment. It tells us a story of a man who was corrupted by society wherein he lost his innocence and sense of idealism along the way that led him to a destructive end of his life. The movie was told in reverse chronological order which started with Yeong-ho's suicide in 1999 and it ends with Yeong-ho's life as a happy and innocent young man in 1979. It was divided in seven parts it presents how his life was devastating as the 20 years go by from being a failed businessman and husband,an abusive policeman,a military soldier who accidentally kills somebody and an idealistic young lover in parallel with changes in South Korea's history and society and his vulnerability towards them. The acting,direction,cinematography and the screenplay were definitely excellent and outstanding.

Overall,I can only give nothing but praises to this film about a story of innocence lost.",1428451200,3,1813,5.036666666666667
2399103,5,B000B1DSP2,"This movie is about a story of a man who gradually lost his innocence during the democratization movement at Korea; it will let you learn how diplomacy in 1980s Korea destroyed humanity.  You may need some understanding on Korean contemporary history to fully understand what is going on, but it is not entirely necessary.  The subtitle is mostly OK, but contains some mistakes.",1412985600,3,378,4.984126984126984
2399104,1,B000B1DSP2,"What was the point of this movie again?  The movie doesn't make any sense, and the director tries to save it by giving it the typical Korean drama/movie ending..

2399105,5,B000B1DSP2,"Very difficult to get since its out of ""print"" . In my opinion the greatest Korean movie by a great director who is similar to the Hong Kong director Wong Kar Wai.",1411689600,2,163,4.125
2399106,3,B000B1DSP2,"Watched about half of this movie, but I lost interest and turned it off.  I think I just didn't really like the main character.",1403308800,2,127,4.291666666666667
2399107,4,B000B1DSP2,"PEPPERMINT CANDY is directed by Lee Chang-Dong (OASIS), another film professor turned director. I think he is one of the frontrunners of Korean cinema along with Hong Sang-soo (Woman is the future of man), Kim Ki-Duk (The Isle), Park Chan-Wook (Oldboy) and Kim Jee-Woon (A Bittersweet Life). Lee is a master of true South Korean melodrama; ""Peppermint Candy"" is his 2nd venture in the art of film-making. This film is a work of art, his talent shines through, and this film will surely be part of his legacy in Korean cinema that will not be forgotten.

A distraught man stands in the middle of the train tracks in a train's path facing certain death. Told in reverse chronological order, through the film's proceedings reveal  the sequences that brought him to this situation in the first place and the reason for his state of mind. Why is this everyday man standing in the path of death? Seemingly hopeless, this film is the tale of a broken man.

It is very difficult to give an in-depth overview of this film without spoiling the experience. If you've seen ""MEMENTO"", then you have a good idea of how this film plays out. However, this film is a very different animal than the Hollywood hit. Through the film's reverse sequences we retrace the life of this man and perhaps make sense of what drove him to self destruction. We go backwards through his life from his failed marriage and his dead-end job, his first love, he was traumatized when he served in the army; all these factors contributed to the emotional and psychological breakdown of this broken man.

Lee's direction is excellent. He accurately captures the essence of a lost and tortured soul; he has crafted a meticulous tale that looks into the psyche of a man with all the things he has done to cope with the challenges of life and the choices he made to get there, his natural ability all but fails him that led him to this situation. I am trying to avoid describing this film as a random chain of events by going through the details of the plot which I think will spoil its effect. To make it easier, I will have to break everything down by the film's themes; a kind, sensitive human being has been tainted by the hate and fear he has experienced in his life. He has made some bad decisions that resulted in several disastrous repercussions that were out of his control. This man has given up on life, he begins to despise himself, and the end result is an exhausted, somewhat delusional and suicidal shell of man. Now, instead of beginning the study of his character from his days as a `kind' and sensitive man, turn it around. What we get is an effective character study or case study if you will if you're a psychiatrist. We retrace his life up to the point where his descend into sheer depression began. We also see three decades of Korean history since this is the backdrop of this story.

Aside from Lee's direction, ""Peppermint Candy's"" key to its success is how good the actor is playing the main character; the actor has to be very capable of providing depth and essence to the character of a broken man. Kyung-Gu Sol manages to bear his soul with his stellar performance as Yong-ho. He manages to effectively immerse me in the scenes that I can't help but experience his feelings, thoughts and desire in the proceedings. Fear, rage, empathy, confusion and even contempt are the emotions guaranteed to be felt by the viewers who want to understand Yong-ho. Kyung-Gusol's performance is so powerful and adaptable that he truly expresses the director's views in life and love, also how the world and society influences how we make our choices. To be honest, I was drawn to this film because of Moon So-ri. If you read my review or seen the film ""OASIS""; you'll know and understand why I am so impressed with this actress. Moon So-ri plays Yong-ho's first love; Sunim.  She plays a very important and significant role for without the relationship between Sunim and Yong-ho the film would lose much of its effect and we will not see Yong-ho as empathetic and maybe even despicable. The dynamic chemistry between these two excellent performers is so effective that the two get to act again in Lee's third film ""OASIS"".

PEPPERMINT CANDY is in every sense of the word, backward; both in its theme and execution. You may say it is disturbing, and quite undeniably so. The screenplay's approach with the ""going backwards"" style actually made the film's premise stronger. It is a very realistic if somewhat PESSIMISTIC view of life's ups and downs. Harrowing and undeniably depressing, it is still has a very uncanny ability to express pure beauty through sheer EMOTIONAL pain. It is a VERY honest film that made me ponder life and certainly feel its pain even after the closing credits.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! [4  stars]

VIDEO/AUDIO: 1.85 ratio anamorphic widescreen. The U.S. release has decent PQ and sound. It has some grain and lacks in sharpness and contrast. The picture while acceptable is not exceptional. If you are able to play import DVDs, buy the region-3 Korean release from CJ Entertainment; it has excellent picture and DTS sound. Whatever you do, this film is a must-see.",1194480000,23,5159,4.709534368070954
8081277,2,B000B1DSP2,We watch a lot of Korean TV and movies and tend to like them which is why we keep watching them and rating them favorably. We just want something that tells a story that may be of interest and not for any social or political insight. This story is told in reverse chronological order after the main characters suicide and that seemed an interesting premise. It begins with a reunion that we found to be juvenile and not very entertaining that ends with a suicide. We already didn't care too much about the lead character because hes not all that likeable and as the reverse stories start to unfold hes even more unlikable to the point we really didn't care that he was dead nor were the reasons all that compelling that we would want to see how his life unraveled and let to his demise. Theres clearly a lot of substance to this movie based on other reviews but we just didn't like him and that pretty much sums it up as to why we gave up on it. I would concur that its for a small audience and it would seem they're the ones leaving the preponderance of reviews. From a purely entertainment perspective it wasn't drawing us into it as much as pushing us away because a third of the way in no empathy was elicited and perhaps that was the point. We had just watched The Truth Beneath and that was a dark depressing movie but it was 5-stars because it drew us in and kept our attention so Im expressing a negative viewer opinion.,1507507200,,1428,4.312267657992565

Before directing his first movie (Green Fish), he was a script writer and a full-time high school teacher teaching Korean. Like all other movies he wrote and directed, this movie Peppermint Candy was not made just for entertainment or commercial success though all of them were moderately successful. There is no action or excitement. This is a movie intended for  a small audience. This movie focuses on a young man (a factory worker) and follows his traumatic experience in military, and shows his career as a cop during the dark era of South Korea under military dictatorship. and then a co-owner of a furniture store before killing himself, ALL IN REVERSE TIME SEQUENCE.
