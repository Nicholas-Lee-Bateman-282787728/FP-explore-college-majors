8247129,1,B0012PTWII,"Well i should have listened to the other reviewer who commented on the poor filming of this concert but i really wanted to see Filippa on stage. Filippa is as always brilliant but this is the most appalling filming of a concert I have ever seen. As the other reviewer says it cuts from singer to orchestra to audience too much.

I feel sad to have to give a Filippa product such a review but it is dreadfully.",1263772800,,409,4.243589743589744
8247130,2,B0012PTWII,"The DVD was physically scratchy at the start and for a while I wasn't sure that I was going to see the concert at all.  While the singing was fine the visual production of the concert was well below the standard of any other I have watched. The camera work moving between the singer, the orchestra and the audience was disconcerting. The singer had a visual hearing/mouthpiece which she continually adjusted with her hand during the concert. Overall disappointing as I was going to give the DVD as a present but will now not do so.",1258848000,,531,4.53125

She sang and danced ballet incredibly ""Samson & Dalila: S' pressing Per Te Il Mio Cuor"". It is noted that this disc was not included the wonderful interpretation of Filippa Giordano singing to such ""Ave Maria"". Filippa is a real Diva besides being simple in their treatment, elegant and with a grace out of series.
