2614793,5,B000GLL1AQ,"All I can say is NEXT.......Honestly what can I say that has not already been said about Inuyasha......Inuyasha is the number one anime in my opinion, this is the only anime that has kept my attention for sooo long and made me wanna go and get the seasons on DVD, I like DBZ but I never bought the DVD's......Inuyasha is different, it's addicting.......Every episode keeps you hangin on and makes you anxious for the next one...We are waiting for the rest of the season to come out on DVD..WAITING PATIENTLY..",1160697600,3,509,4.666666666666667
2614794,5,B000GLL1AQ,"...and it still retains every bit of quality as when it started with. Every episode here is lots of fun to see, but really note-worthy stuff that happens here is the two-part epidsode ""Fateful Night In Togenkyo"", where our heros (minus Sango, who has gone to repair her weapon,) encounter a sage who has sold his soul to a tree demon and now shinks people down and eats them. This, by the way, was a story that in the manga occured much earlier, just before the characters met Sango for the first time. Which makes this the only major change the anime makes from it's source material, at least that I'm aware of. (I stopped reading the manga when they stospped releasing it in soft-cover single-issue format in the U.S., which would be after Inu-Yasha's party first meet Koga and Kagome gets upset with Inu-Yasha for implying that she might have had an indecent relasionship with him and she storms back to the present day.)

Anyway. There's also the afore-mentioned Tsubaki story-arch, when the group must face an old enemy of Kikyo's. Other major things that happen here is Naraku gives life to another demon, one that starts out without a face until he takes one from one of his victims, and who turns out to be the re-incarnated Onigumo, the thief who sold his soul to demons which led to the creation of Naraku. And then Inu-Yasha sets out on a quest to make his tetsaiga more powerful, but to accomplish that he just might have to take an innocent life. Later Inu-Yasha and his comrades, Koga and his wolf pack, and Sesshomaru and his lackie Jaken all battle a clan of panther demons. Inu-Yasha's group and Koga also want to rescue Kagome, who's been captured by the panthers. (Now if only they could all stop fighting each other, they just might win...) Finally, Kagome and co. make a starteling discovery when they learn about Rin, the little human girl who travels with Sesshomaru and Jaken.

One thing I really love about this season is we get two episodes where Kagome shows she has a really cute, girlish side to her. (""Shippo Gets An Angry Challenge"" and ""Only You, Sango"") Also I enjoyed ""Jaken's Plan To Steal The Tetsaiga"", where the lizard-like imp sets out on his own, with Rin tagging along, to...well, the name pretty much says it. Jaken becomes much like Wilie E. Cyote from the Road-Runner cartoons, with every scheme to steal Inu-Yasha's sword inevitably ending in disaster.

Can't wait for season 4 to come out on box-set. I just hope it's as good as this one!",1158883200,16,2484,4.6281179138322
2614795,5,B000GLL1AQ,"I recently purchased the Inuyasha Season 3 DVD Box Set with necklace.  I must admit that Inuyasha is my second favorite anime, and television show altogether.  The characters and conflicts are never boring and almost every episode will leave you wanting more.

Specifically, this season contains episodes 55 up to and including 81. This season focuses on battles with Naraku, as well as Inuyasha empowering his sword the Tetsusaiga, but it also gives us a glimpse into the past with Kikyo, Inuyasha, And Sesshomaru.  The episodes are on 5 discs and each disc contains 5 episodes except for the last 2 which each have 6 episodes of the show.  You can choose to watch the episodes in English or Japanese, with subtitles only in English.  I bought the edition with Kagome's necklace, or bottle with the Shikon shards inside.

Some highlights of this season include the first appearance of Tsubaki, the evil Dark Priestess who knew Kikyo even before she met Inuyasha.  Naraku has recruited her help to try and destroy Kagome!  Next you'll see Naraku release Musso, his newest incarnation, but Musso is much different from any other incarnation so far and his actions will cause a Three Sided Battle to the Death between Naraku, Inuyasha, and himself.  Next Inuyasha must empower his sword Tetsusaiga by slaying Taigokomeru, the evil Bat Demon, but will Inuyasha's heart let him kill the real one behind Taigokomeru?

Next we get into a history lesson of Sesshomaru's past as the panther demons that he and his father fought years ago return for revenge.  These episodes especially explain much including why Sesshomaru hates Inuyasha so much. They also show the continuing maturing of Tenseiga, Sesshomaru's strongest(yes I said strongest) sword.  The season ends with Naraku trying to absorb Sesshomaru into his body.  Will Sesshomaru be able to defeat Naraku on his own, or will Inuyasha have to come to his aid?  The outcome is unbelievable!

I recommend these great episodes of Inuyasha to any fan.  The price is far better than buying the individual DVDs and there are many more adventures than the few I mentioned above. I can't wait for Season 4!",1158105600,13,2149,4.9415041782729805
2614796,4,B000GLL1AQ,"""Season 3"" of Inuyasha marks the halfway point of the series with apt intrigue and plenty of side-stories to keep the viewer occupied along the way. Fittingly enough, the main villain and antagonist of the show (Naraku) mysteriously vanishes after what seems like a death blow - forcing viewers to assume that our heroes will need another 80 episodes in order to have another shot. Oh joy.

But not to worry - Takahashi's creativity and talent are more than enough to ensure the continued success of this one-of-a-kind Anime. The main highlights of this season include: the story of resurrected ""dark"" priestess Tsubaki - former rival to Kikyo, now new recruit under Naraku; Inuyasha's quest to further strengthen the Tetsusaiga in order to break Naraku's new barrier; and the dramatic confrontation between Naraku and the two Inu (dog) demons Inuyasha and Sesshoumaru.

I really can't complain about Inuyasha - the only problem that could be called into question is the series' length. Then again, series in Japan have been known to run for much longer (Dragonball, Detective Conan, Naruto, etc.) - so not much complaint there either. The next season promises just as much, if not more - so look forward to it!",1155081600,10,1211,4.960591133004926

2614832,5,B000GLL1AQ,"One of my favorite series. I won't bore you with the details as most of the ones purchasing will be well acquainted with Inuyasha's storyline. Instead, I want to focus strictly on the dvds. First of all, I'm really happy to have found these and to have found them with the appropriate subtitles. Netflix has two seasons and a while back had begun using the words from the Americanized version rather than the Japanese translation. That's actually what prompted me to purchase this set. I'd gotten some years ago, but I guess they were before the North American dvd release b/c the subtitles were often in Chinese or the menus tended to freeze a lot. Then again, perhaps I purchased some bootleg copies without knowing it.

Anyways, I love that these dvds have the entire season in one package. The price is very reasonable. The menu works well (though the earlier seasons have a good bit of lag while the newer ones flowed better when maneuvering with the FF or Skip option (I don't like having to watch every opening, one right after the other). Wish it had some actual extras other than the same skimpy little character bios and trailers. Still, I plan to have an Inuyasha marathon at least twice a year, so will definitely get some use out of these.",1445040000,3,1252,4.614349775784754

I purchased the whole season and am now unable to return or refund it because I watched 30 seconds of the first episode while fiddling with the settings trying to see if the switch was possible... which it is not.
On a personal side note I think the show itself is amazing. I love Inuyasha and would have a five star review if only I could listen to the much better Japanese voice actors, instead of the undertrained, poor quality American ones.

Standard definition - so 4:3 ratio with obvious static and other SD flaws, but that's cool. There isn't much you can do when upconverting an original SD work.

There are Bluray discs of the final act and the movies, but that is probably all there will ever be.

2614891,4,B000GLL1AQ,Have loved this series since I first saw it years ago on Adult Swim. Not really into a lot of anime but this one I truly appreciate. My only complaint is that the later seasons are missing from Prime. Pretty crappy on Amazon's part. Add them so I can justify the amount I spend on Prime. Pretty ridiculous that they aren't. Guess I will wait till they come off them or go somewhere else.,1412899200,,387,4.243243243243243

2614968,4,B000GLL1AQ,"This box set contains the twenty-seven episodes that make up the third season of the Inuyasha anime series.  There are also three special features: an ""Inuyasha Super Special"" that recaps what happened during the second season of Inuyasha (I assume this aired in Japan right before the third season started), the ""textless opening,"" and the ""textless closing.""

Unlike the first two season box sets, there were absolutely no trailers included on this box set.  This wasa very welcome change from having the trailers included at the beginning of each disc for the second season dvd box set.

When it comes to the episodes, season three relied more on stories that spanned multiple episodes, even though there were only a couple of episodes that were labeled as being multi-part episodes.  There were fewer stand alone episodes in this season when compared to seasons one and two.  The third season definitely focused a lot more on character stories and character progressions than the previous two seasons.

This set is a ""must have"" if you are a fan of Inuyasha.  While the special features aren't very impressive, the episodes included on this set help to shed some light on the characters and their motivations.",1219708800,3,1213,5.0

2614970,5,B000GLL1AQ,"It isn't hard to believe that this show continued to bring in fans.  It has your standard anime good vs evil.  Monsters, battles upon battles and all of that other stuff.  But Inuyasha brings up a notch with its excellent interaction between each of the characters Kagome (who gets sucked into this world through a well in her present day home) she makes trips back and for to see her family (Mom, grandfather and lil brother) and Inuyasha (with her sit boy affect everytime he annoys her which is pretty much all the time) that smashes Inuyasha's face in the ground on a regular basis, Sango and Maroku (sometimes liking each other but mostly Sango's slapping him because he can't keep his hands off of her bottom..for lack of a better term and every other female for that matter) and he's a monk on top of it.  It adds something extra to an already great story...along with Shipo, Kilala (Sango's pet that turns into a ferocious cat when in battle).  Plus Inuyasha's brother Seshomaru (sp?) who has his own issues with his little brother and the big bad evil of the whole show Naraku (he's one powerful guy no question) and uses any and all means to get what he wants.  Also add to the fact Inuyasha's past won't go away in the form his lover Kikiyo and of course she has a younger sister (not so young looking now that 50 years have passed) who is a priestess just like her.

Its just a great collection brought together for fans of old and new to enjoy at their leisure with so much action going and everyone trying to get a piece of that Sacred Jewel shard..its no wonder so many monsters are running loss all over the countryside.  Of course with the way Season 3 ended its only going to get more intense for everyone as they continue to search for more jewel shard fragments and a way to wipe out Naraku for good.

Excellent buy and so addictive its crazy.",1194048000,,1863,4.423976608187134
2614971,5,B000GLL1AQ,"The third season of Inuyasha continues to reveal the genius and deft writing skills of Romiko Tagahashi as we are drawn into Naraku's web of murder and deceit. The  climax is of course the battle between Naraku vs. Sesshomaru and Inuyasha, after Inuyasha gains access to the Red Tetsuiga. Kagura also makes a move against her master Naraku, and tries to enlist Sesshomaru to help her, who of course is no help at all.",1193356800,,417,4.635135135135135

With each new episode they have you on the edge of your seat, but at the same time you are laughing at the laid back comedy of the situations that Inuyasha and his little buddies get into.

Having all of Season 3 available at your fingertips to do an InuYasha marathon, too good for words (Having all 3 season sets, priceless.)  The Season itself doesn't fail to engross you even further into the wonderful tale started with ""The girl who overcame time, and the boy who was just overcome"" from episode 1 of the first season to the last episode of season 3 I wouldn't want to miss a moment.  An amazing work and every episode a new discovery can be made into the depths of the storyline and each character.  A must have!!",1168387200,,585,4.490566037735849
2614981,5,B000GLL1AQ,"Fans of Inuyasha will not be diasappointed. There is more character development when we see Shippo fall in love for the first time and the relationship between Miroku and Sango is developed further. Kagome gets it into her head that the two just need a nudge in the right direction. Inuyasha however is oblivious to it all as only he can be. Also watch out for Rin- she gets kidnapped and Sesh's reaction is interesting.....

Die hard fans of Inuyasha will love this next season. I know I did.",1168300800,,493,4.53932584269663
