8544301,1,B009TT3I2A,It was flapping around in the case and when I put it in the dvd player it acted like there was no movie on it. I paid alil less then 20 dollars for it then turn around and paid almost 6 dollars to ship it back and all I got was 13 dollars as a refund. bad costumer service I would have liked a new one sent back to me!!!!!,1374105600,,322,3.6142857142857143

8544305,1,B009TT3I2A,"I hope you will not make the same mistake I did!  I pre-ordered it before reading and understanding the info Amazon supplied about it being only AUDIO playable on a DVD player in the United States.  But I forgot to cancel the order, and it was sent to me. Of course I had to try it anyway, and of course it would not play on my CD or Blu-ray players.  It is only usable as a DVD on a DVD player not normally used in the United States - only in Europe and maybe elsewhere. I can probably reconnect my old DVD player and hear the audio, but who cares much about just hearing a DVD when you cannot see it.  Since I had removed the shrink wrap, I could not return it to Amazon.  So I am out $27.37 including the tax charged. Maybe someday I will take the time to hear it!!!",1359331200,2,769,3.9675324675324677
