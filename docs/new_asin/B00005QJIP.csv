7950709,5,B00005QJIP,"Red to Kill is a brutal rape/revenge flick from China made in the early 90's. A story about a boy who witnessess his father and brother get murdered by his own mother after she is caught in bed with another man. His mother was wearing a red dress when this happened, now as an adult whenever he see's the color red he is driven to brutally rape anyone in his path (hence the name Red to Kill). Did I mention he work's at a home for the mentally challenged?? That's right, what seperates this rape/revenge flick from the rest is the fact that the crime's are commited against mentally challenged women. There is no shortage of disturbing moment's here, in the first 4 minutes you have a woman and her mentally challenged son jump out of a 10 story building spraying blood all over the place while cutting in between shot's of a brutal and very graphic rape scene. There is a little gore and some very violent moment's. One scene even made me cringe. Let's just say it involved a victim of rape, a straightrazor, and her desire to be ""clean"". Only recommended if you have no soul.",1198540800,,1078,4.422110552763819
7950710,5,B00005QJIP,"Billy Tang's 'Yeuk Saat' ('Red To Kill') is a wicked little gem. This film occupies a very disturbing, but thoroughly entertaining realm. I went into this film with high expectations. Needless to say, I was not let down in the least. They just don't make films like this in North America or Europe. 'Red To Kill' pushes the limits of acceptability brilliantly, and will no doubt leave even jaded viewers surprised and entertained...

Ben Ng's portrayal of a psychopathic rapist who falls in love with a retarded girl whom he had raped is amazing. There is just something about the main antagonist is these Cat III films (I am thinking of Mr. Ng & Anthony Wong) that borders on frightening. The level of mania, and the exuberance which with these fine actors execute scene after scene with obvious psychotic glee is spellbinding. Me and my girlfriend were blown away by how unbelievably psychotic and deranged Ben Ng was in this gem. He easily rivals Anthony Wong (from 'The Untold Story' and 'Ebola Syndrome') for cinema's most wicked and insane psychopath...

If you are familiar with Cat III films, you know what to expect- over-the-top violence and wicked rape scenes unflinchingly caught by the lens. I have witnessed many of these films in the past 6 months, and this is one of the better ones...

Some may take issue with the fact that the majority of this film takes place in a home for the retarded. To me, that made the film all the more entertaining. Perhaps if I believed in hell, I would go there; but damn, I sure got some cheap laughs out of this film. The retarded actors and actresses were highly amusing. Me and my girlfriend couldn't help from laughing out loud at numerous scenes...

At the same time, there were some very touching elements to this film. The scene after Ming-Ming (Lily Chung) got raped, when her fellow institution mates were crying and giving her gifts nearly brought a tear to my eye- it was incredibly touching (for real, I am not being facetious)...

I realize I haven't covered too many plot details in this little review/comment. You will have to watch this amazing and unforgettable film yourself if you want to know what happens. If you are a fan of extreme cinema (specifically Cat III films), you will very likely love this movie. From a cinema-obsessive who seeks out edgy entertainment, 'Red To Kill' comes highly recommended...",1170374400,3,2377,4.759708737864078
7950711,4,B00005QJIP,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer who said that the graphic rape seens are brutal, unforgiving, and rewarding in every way for the sick-minded among us.  However, I also agree with the person who said this doesn't get near the ""Irreversible"" category of permanent damage to the victims.  The plot is pretty bizarre, but if you can swallow that, you may be in for a treat.",1142035200,2,380,4.573529411764706
7950712,4,B00005QJIP,"First of all, let me tell you, this is NOT a date movie.  This is the most brutal graphic rape movie I have ever seen, and also one that lingers in your mind long after it is over.  For me, that's exactly what I want when I see a movie, one that leaves a lasting impression no matter how difficult the impression might be.  I loved this movie, because it is very very well made, and the acting performances are incredible.  Yes, the rapes are unforgiving in every respect, and the misery throughout the film is almost difficult to watch at times.  This is not a gory movie, except for the last ten minutes, it is a very disturbing movie and it does have a fair amount of nudity, however it really needs to.  ""The Untold Story"" and ""Ebola Syndrome"" offset much of the carnage with humor, but ""Red to Kill"" has absolutely NOTHING to smile about.  It is totally and brutally serious from the first frame to the extremely nasty ending.  The story is pretty simple, a psycho-rapist is on the loose and he's going after a mentally retarded young dancer.  In the second graphic rape of the movie he does the deed to the young lady.  Enter a female social worker who tries to help the victim, and dreams up a plan to get even with the rapist after he gets off in court because of a stupid technicality.  Her plan succeeds to a certain extent, but not like she planned it, and the rapist comes after her full force.  The actor who plays the rapist is absolutely sensational, and I might add, the musical score is perfect.  The music adds so much to the all ready existing tension from all the horrific acts.  The actress who plays the retarded girl is also amazing, one of the best performances on film you will ever see.  To end this, this is a must-see movie for fans of this genre, and I'm just getting started myself.  Not the gore associated with the two previous Cat III movies I watched, but something even more terrible and unrelenting, and an uneasy feeling that will not leave you anytime soon after you see it.  ""Red to Kill"" is flatout a good movie, even considering the subject matter.  I highly recommend it.",1109289600,8,2113,4.402061855670103
7950713,2,B00005QJIP,"This one is a trip to say the least. It starts strange even from  the menu (my menu's play button says ""On Air""). Then we go steaming into the movie itself. A crazy housewife throws herself and her retarded son off a building. Cut to a mildly intense (and very exploitively shot) rape scene. Then we are experiencing the day to day happenings of a home for the retarded - where the head administrator is the rapist. I'm not really spoiling anything here. The movie lets this on about 20 minutes in.

The man that plays the rapist goes over the top, to say the least. At one point he stalks around his room, crazy and horny  (wearing a jock strap, no less) fondling and strangling a  mannequin.

The movie tries to hide its lust for exploitation under the guise of being a film about a serious subject. You can ultimately tell that it was filmed for the T and A. There's quite a bit during the two rape scenes. Also, the helpful teacher gets dolled up towards the end. Although her idea of being sexy is seductively drinking a clamdigger - celery included. But there is no nudity from her sadly (I think she's cute). And it is rather off putting to have the guy walking around in more revealing uderwear than the women. I mean, he's wearing a thong, for God's sake! Is this a Chinese metaphor for being ""crazy and sexually rapacious""? You be the judge.

I will say, I have seen a lot of bizarre translations on Asian imports, but this one contains one of the classics. During a scene when an angry crowd is confronting the administrator out front of the home - a man yells in his face and says ""You let me f*** and a**  and I say your good, damn!"" And he's supposed to be angry at this guy? Truly a hilarious moment. And people in the film refer to rapists as ""sex lupines"". I really don't know how to translate that one.

Ultimately a bizarre flick that doesn't deliver on much that it promises. The rape scenes are not too schocking (especially when compared to something like IRREVERSIBLE). I will say the last sequence is pretty gruesome. Fluorescent bulbs and table saws, anyone?

Ultimately, a lot of the acting comes off as B-grade. Some sickos out there - we are legion - might enjoy parts, but most would probably prefer to stay away.

I'm keeping my copy though....",1103500800,8,2274,4.431654676258993
7950714,1,B00005QJIP,"This is probably the worst film I have ever sat through.  Completely unfun and cruel.  You a sick person to want to buy this.  Watch it once maybe yes.  Buy it?  Sick and not fun.  No redeeming context either.  The film is its own punishment,  if you can get to the cheery pop song at the end.",1036022400,2,293,4.017543859649122
7950715,5,B00005QJIP,"Oustanding performance, and story line. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for the best in horror movies. Movie scenes at it best and the story line is great. Just the final action scene of the movie makes your money worth.  Only one negative aspect; the subtittles are paste into the movie and been the DVD version it could have more features like director comments, actors profiles, ect.",1022112000,4,395,4.8088235294117645
7950716,4,B00005QJIP,"RED TO KILL
[Ruo Sha]

(Hong Kong - 1994)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

Though Chinese cinema has always demonstrated a morbid fascination with violence and bloodshed - from the vintage horror films of Maxu Weibang through to Chang Cheh's splattery kung fu pictures of the 1970's - it wasn't until the early 90's that Hong Kong horror movies secured their strongest foothold within mainstream culture. Following the unexpected success of gruesome 'true crime' dramas DR. LAMB (1992) and THE UNTOLD STORY (1993) - both helmed by Danny Lee Sau-yin (Chow Yun-fat's cop nemesis in John Woo's THE KILLER) - the former colony was subsequently deluged by a wave of confrontational 'Category III' (Adults Only) movies, spearheaded by the work of controversial director Billy Tang Hin-shing. Already notorious for a scene in RUN AND KILL (1993) in which a little boy is burned alive in merciless detail, Tang proceeded to scale the heights of calculated outrage with RED TO KILL, arguably one of the most harrowing films ever made.

Orphaned by the sudden death of her parents, a mentally handicapped young woman (Lily Chung Suk-wai) is remanded to the care of a hostel for the disabled, where she falls prey to 'kindly' caretaker Ben Ng Ngai-cheung, a musclebound hulk whose charming demeanor belies his true nature: Traumatized by a childhood incident in which his mother slaughtered his father and brother with a meatcleaver, drenching him in blood, Ng's murderous psychosis is triggered by the color red, resulting in horrific explosions of rape and murder. Unable to control himself when confronted by Chung wearing a long scarlet dress, Ng assaults her and is promptly arrested, but his indictment is later dismissed on a technicality, and the three main characters (including Money Lo Man-yee as a sympathetic social worker) converge on the workshop beneath the hostel for a climactic showdown which closes proceedings on a note of screaming hysteria.

Judged alongside similar Asian atrocities, such as MEN BEHIND THE SUN (1987) or the infamous ""Guinea Pig"" series from Japan, RED TO KILL is either a fearless challenge to established cinematic limits or a reckless descent into the abyss, depending on your point of view. Photographed with stunning visual flair by Tony Mau Gin-fai and expertly edited by Choi Hung, the movie alternates scenes of naive sentimentality with eruptions of graphic horror, taking time to establish Chung's beauty and innocence before unleashing the forces of hell against her. But while Chung and Lo are dignified in adversity, Ng plays the villain as an unstoppable force of nature, literally throbbing with uncontrollable rage - his descent into complete psychosis during the hair-raising finale provokes a devastating rampage which is truly frightening to behold. Unsurprisingly, Ng has been typecast in villainous roles ever since.

But the filmmakers' bravura technique, coupled with an obstinate lack of moral restraint, makes it difficult to defend the film's worst excesses. The protracted rape scenes are designed as a visual spectacle, showcasing the humiliation of vulnerable female characters with all the subtlety of a leering freak show. Worse still, following the sexual assault on Chung which constitutes the movie's pivotal set-piece, the actress is involved in a shocking episode of self-mutilation which not only degrades the entire production, but seems deliberately contrived to test viewers' patience to breaking point. However, despite its questionable motives, the film is executed with such breathtaking cinematic gusto, it compels attention in a way that few other horror movies have managed before or since.

Director Tang continued his one-man assault on the boundaries of taste and decency with popular potboilers like BROTHER OF DARKNESS (1994) and SEXY AND DANGEROUS (1996) before going 'legit' with a number of socially conscious dramas, beginning with CHINESE MIDNIGHT EXPRESS (1997), featuring Ben Ng and HARD-BOILED's Tony Leung Chiu-wai.",1019779200,22,4023,5.376190476190477
7950717,5,B00005QJIP,"I wrote a brief review of this film at the end of another review for Henry-portriat of a serial killer. In that review I told readers to purchase this movie on e-bay, only because I had no idea amazon carried it. My apoligies to amazon, I shouldn't have doubted you. Anyway as I was saying in the other review, this is one of the most brutal films I have seen. It was also one of the best in the genre. If you are able to sit through a movie with subtitles(which takes a lot for me to do)than by all means get this movie. I will warn you, you can't watch this one with any conscience. It is about a mentally retarded girl(who really dosn't act retarded at all)who's father is killed in a car accident, and is left alone. A social worker takes the girl to an orphanage for the specially challenged. They become good friends and Ming-Ming actually starts to adapt to her new life. While all this is happening, there is a serial rapist on the loose in the building. Then one night Ming-Ming herself is brutally raped by the maniac. There are two rape scenes in the picture, one at the beginning of the movie and the one involving Ming-Ming and they are both disturbing. I doubt you can watch the later the whole way through without turning away. The camera never pans away and you see a lot more than american films ever show. Full frontal nudity and the whole nasty act. Even though this movie is pretty rough I liked it for a few reasons. The acting was really good, especially that of the sicko doing all the evil in the film. He was really believable and demented. You also don't find out who he is until half the film is over(just a shape at times and at others not showing his face). Plus I am a jaded horror fan and love movies with great shock value. This isn't really a horror movie although it does horrify. The closest i've seen to this movie in shock value is Ilsa-She Wolf of The SS. So if you are not easily offended and can stomach some strong violence and gore(the gore is mostly at the end)than pick this movie up. Also, don't look for a happy ending here as not much of this film is happy. Just remember, no wemon and no children.  P.S.-LET US NEVER FORGET 9/11/01! GOD BLESS.",1017705600,3,2191,4.292270531400966
