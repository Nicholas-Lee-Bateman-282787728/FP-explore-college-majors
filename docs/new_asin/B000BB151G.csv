2410081,4,B000BB151G,"I enjoyed this series and of course the effects are of it's period but the stories are very advanced and well thought out.  What I didn't like was that it was in black and white. I wish they had recolorized these episodes, but in spite of that the acting is engaging and the kids are good time travelers.  One thing that bothers me about people reviewing old series is when they complain about special effects. These effects were great to people in 1970! They didn't make this show using todays effects because it was made 40 years ago.  So it never bodes well to complain about effects from anything older than 15 years.  The stories are engaging and it's a good thing they still exist at all because they often got rid of shows back then to create space on cabinets.  So while I would hope that someday will restore color to these episodes , I doubt that will ever happen ,unless some fan in the future does it on his own. with technology racing forward I can see this being done easily with a computer in the future! or maybe even now! Anyways if you want a decent vintage series that is of it's era and yet has great stories this one may be for  you, if you can handle the black and white. And in my opinion very few shows look better in black and white, even shindlers list which was a great movie should have shot in color in my opinion.  oh well.",1280275200,,1353,4.26171875
2410082,1,B000BB151G,"As a fan of Science Fiction, I jumped at the chance to own this series at the low price (from the new section.. not the Amazon price!)
The quality of acting sucked!  I can't put it any other way.  The Clone/Doctor was horrible.. . you could tell he had acted on stage and still apparently thought he was on stage.  William Shatner was able to carry the accent the last word routine but not him!  He sucked the life out of the show!
it was funny watching the actors struggle with their lines, frequently restarting what they were saying.. the Liz character's actress does this frequently!
The genre was cool, but they killed the plotline quickly with the horrible acting.. Simon's character's actor also over-dramatized his role as well!  Wow they sucked!
The plot also had issues... I had problems following part of it.  The end was rather silly and seemed to violate the main plot!
I really want my watching time that I wasted watching this dog BACK!
I give it one star for its bold plotline... too bad the actors and actresses killed whatever sort of plot there was!
I give this a DO NOT BUY - NO MATTER HOW CHEAP!",1273363200,2,1116,4.472906403940887
2410083,3,B000BB151G,"As a big fan of modern science fiction (Battlestar Galactica, Stargate Atlantis and so on), I feel it only fair that I occasionally take a moment (or 11 hours as the case may be) to pay some respect to the earlier examples of science fiction television.  After all, to fully appreciate where we are in a given genre, it oft requires an understanding of where we've come from.  That and while perusing the A&E scifi catalog in eager anticipation of their November box set release of Farscape, I came upon this one DVD collection I had never heard of before and hence had to purchase immediately.

Enter Timeslip The Complete Series, a show that appeared on British airwaves back in 1970.  This science fiction serial, as the title may suggest, dealt with the concept of time travel only unlike HG Wells' earlier vision of the notion (or Back to the Future's later telling), there is no physical machine that can be operated to travel through temporal space/time.  Rather certain individuals, or so the story goes, are capable of sensing then traveling through temporal vortexes (or ""time bubbles"").  Think invisible barriers that emit a strange sound only audible to children.

Once through the barrier, the traveler has in essence entered a realm left behind due to a unique energy signature.  So even though time passes as you might expect, the uniqueness of any given moment can leave a perfect imprint in the fabric of existence that can be revisited.  This isn't limited to the past either as apparently the future has left behind its own patterns that can be visited by occupants of the present.  Confused yet? Don't be- the bottom line is that a pair of fifteen-year-old British kids can slip through the time bubble at will to visit either the past and future.

The set, as is typical of A&E's DVD collections, is nothing short of spectacular and comes as four DVDs each within its own thin pack all housed in a cardboard outer slipcase.  Runtime of the full 26-episode series comes in at a whopping ten hours, fifty minutes and the fourth disc contains a nice host of extras.  Among these is a documentary piece entitled ""Beyond the Barrier"", intro clips from the original program, cast and production biographies, and an interactive map.

The show, while not rated, is pretty safe to say open to general audiences due to the tight restrictions of broadcast television in the early 1970s both here in the States and abroad.  There's a bit of violence throughout (in one section the kids visit WWII) but absolutely no gore or offensive language.

The show technically consists of 26 episodes but the formatting is such that even the most intelligent science fiction fans among us may come out a bit confused.  For starters there are actually only 4 ongoing story threads here: The Wrong End of Time, The Time of the Ice Box, The Year of the Burn Up, and The Day of the Clone.  Each of these stories consists of 6 parts (what we would call ""episodes"") except for Year of the Burn Up, which contains 8.

Easy enough so far except that because whoever authored these discs decided to steer clear of words like ""episodes"" and ""chapters"" you'll find yourself drowning in a river of ""parts"".  Each episode is called a part, each chapter a part, and then each act is broken down into two more parts to signify the first (before the commercial break) and the second and final one.  I don't know about you but to me that's a lot of parts!  The good news is that if you have the time to devote, each disc contains essentially one story thread and there is a ""Play All"" option that let's the viewer sit back and forget about making sense of the parts routine altogether.

Audiovisual quality is exactly what you might expect when someone decides to transfer black and white film into digital medium.  It's much clearer and crisper than fans watching it on a B&W television back in 1970 could ever have imagined possible but it still reveals the limitations of the technology at the time.  Though digitally remastered, the DVDs show the dust patterns of the film stock during the transfer and the audio has an unmistakable start & stop quality about it that harkens to the days where voice work was done entirely on tapes.  The black and white aspect takes a little adjustment to get used to but doesn't detract from being able to enjoy the material nearly as much as I anticipated.  Strangely enough there is a single color episode included which actually has the opposite effect of what I expected.  Color film simply reveals too much detail of the campy outfits, horribly unrealistic sets, and acting slip ups.  This may be the only time in recorded history that I'll go as far as to say being in black and white actually improves the material.

Speaking of the material, let's talk about the show itself in terms of writing and plot development.  On the one side of the coin, it's better than I would have thought.  In case you aren't fluent on your 1970's sci fi, let's just say that it wasn't the world's finest era for the genre.  I half expected corny rubber masks, tin foil monsters, and miniatures that are to space craft what a Hot Wheels play set is to a real metropolis.  Fortunately, none of this is this case with Timeslip.  Thanks to the fact that the writing is solid and the stories play from a human element, special effects are a very small aspect to the overall prose.  I can almost liken it to watching early Alfred Hitchcock works whereas his ability to tell a solid tale more than makes up for the limitations of the technology of the period (one might go as far as to say that the abundance of visual effects at a filmmaker's disposal these days has severely compromised the art of story telling, but that's a debate for a different day).

For the most part Timeslip makes a conscious effort to combine decent science with the fiction, which is a definite plus.  If you really want to nitpick, it is possible to find a few flaws in the reasoning such as the following:  It is explained time and time again that because the time bubble is simply an energy-imprint, the kids in question can visit different eras without the risk of being hurt or dying because they aren't actually ""in"" the past or future but rather merely in a holographic reconstruction due to the energy left behind.  Absolutely brilliant in my opinion as a means of overcoming the usual time travel paradoxes (and a theory which could explain a lot about what we perceive as ghosts)...  Trouble is the kids shouldn't be able to interact with the individuals in the past or future either then.  The explanation that time can be replayed like a movie should force the time travelers to witness events just like as if they were in fact looking at a movie.  Unfortunately that's not the case here probably because how entertaining would a story with lead characters just watching the action really be?

Another little peccadillo comes in the form of the space/ time continuum as there is apparently very little regard given to the laws of traversing physical distance when crossing the barrier.  The first story handles this dilemma best by having the children step through to the exact same location, just thirty years earlier.  Rather than a rundown military outpost as it was in the year 1970, the children step through to an active base amidst a German invasion during World War II.

After the first episode, the children begin a series of warps into the future where not only are they stepping through time, but great geographic distance as well (Antarctica, Liverpool etc.)

Little scientific glitches aside (I mean after all this was written in an era that precedes the handheld calculator), the show dazzles with concepts and dilemmas that we've actually come to know such as global warming, the trouble of relying upon computers too heavily, and the risks involved in cloning human beings.  Considering that the material is just about forty years old, the insight and thought-process that went into the writing is pretty darn remarkable.

Of course on the slip side the acting is pretty rough at times.  The two teen actors (Cheryl Burfield and Spencer Banks as Liz Skinner and Simon Randall respectively) do an admirable job, especially in the earlier episodes.  As time goes on poor Cheryl must have been told to interject a lot more drama into her performances, as she tends to overact in many of the later episode scenes.  Also the show has the odd habit of retaining actor slip-ups and mispronunciations throughout.  It's nothing too distracting but certainly noticeable (and has me wondering about the editing process in those days and whether retakes were even feasible as a result).

In all, there is no real danger of abandoning today's science fiction series like Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles or even yesteryear's time shifting programs (like Quantum Leap or Sliders) to devote entirely to Timeslip but that isn't to suggest that it isn't a charming little production from a simpler era.  The stories work pretty well (especially the first one) and the science was certainly ahead of its time.  The set retails for a staggering $79.99 and some stores are asking that much for it but deals to the tune of $10 and under are out there.  For the latter, it's quite a solid deal and recommended to viewers of all ages.",1255392000,16,9327,4.718692165330043
2410084,5,B000BB151G,"I saw this on tv when I was a kid, (I live in UK) and only ever saw it in black and white owing to the fact we only had a black and white tv at the time. I was interested in seeing the colour episode on the dvd in The Ice Box story. What a shame that all the rest of the colour episodes were of such bad quality that they could not be used, only the one. But at least it is from my favourite story, The Ice Box, though the first one was very good too, when the kids end up back in wartime.

I used to like John Barcroft who played Bukov in The Ice Box. Thought he was quite good looking. Never saw him in anything else, before or since.

Not so keen on the last two stories but the first two are very good indeed, and I was fascinated back then as a child seeing all these mind boggling concepts about time travel that really made me think and fired my imagination about old abandoned airforce or ministry of defence places. Something very creepy about those places especially on a dark night or with a cold moon and that first story in the series where the kids find the hole in time in the gap in the wire fence really held my interest back then.
I've always been fascinated in anything like this since, but sadly have not seen anything quite like it since, so to me, it is unique in that respect.

Wish there were more series like this one.",1196985600,7,1343,4.022471910112359
2410085,4,B000BB151G,"I agree with everything that has been said about this show, and only wanted to point out that all but one episode are in black and white. ADDITION TO ORIGINAL REVIEW: Well, I saw the color episode and it's spoiled watching the other B/W episodes. The problem is, when you film in B/W, you know you need to show contrast. In color, you can use a more subtle palette, such as varying shades of blue in the same outfit. When you watch this in B/W, everything is a shade of gray. Very disappointed, wish they were all in B/W so I wouldn't know what I was missing.",1189814400,6,559,4.233644859813084
2410086,3,B000BB151G,"I just finished watching the 4 episodes of Timeslip and would rate this series as average. The first episode is only fair and the actors seem to not yet feel comfortable in their roles. Also, the story itself for the first episode is not very good. However, each of the next three episodes gets progressively better in terms of acting and storyline. The series is very low budget for sure and this seems most obvious in the first couple of episodes. For example, in the second episode (Ice Box) the various scientists at a research station eagerly take orders from printed computer commands (very clunky and not believable).

In summary, I would say this is overpriced given the general average quality, but as I say, the last couple of episodes are not bad.",1184371200,3,758,4.6992481203007515

They are not always alone and also connected telepathically. Similar to projects like The Time Tunnel (1966), but has more of that ancient British TV such as the first shows of Doctor Who (1963) with William Hartnell.

8084300,5,B000BB151G,"I watched this show when it was first broadcast on the tellie in England. I recently rewatched the complete series with my husband on DVD, and we both enjoyed it. OK, the acting isn't great, the sets are laughable, and you could drive a London underground train through some of the holes in the plot, but it is a lot of fun.

Liz and Simon have adventures over the course of four series: the first is set in WWII, and we meet a young Commander Trainer and Liz's dad as a young man; the second is set in the distant future - 1990 - on an ice-covered world, where we meet a grown up and not very nice Liz; the third is set at the same time in the future as the second series, but this time in world burning up after environmental messing around, where we meet a friendly, grown-up Liz and a grown-up Simon - and learn that these futures are only possibilities; and the fourth and final series set 5 years in the past in 1965. (The actress playing grown-up Liz must have had a great time playing the same character in two completely different ways.)

I remember liking this show so much that I even had the tie-in paperback novel of the show. If you like slick, modern TV shows, you will not enjoy this series. If you appreciate earnest, low-budget early sci-fi attempts - and remember this was a kids' show - you should definitely give this show a chance, especially at Amazon's excellent price.

Update 8/1/2013: Whoa! Amazon's price is not so excellent anymore! Definitely try to get a hold of this series, but look elsewhere if Amazon cannot stock it at a normal price. For shame, Amazon, at pricing this so high!",1335312000,2,1614,4.391304347826087

So check them out as the travel forwards and backwards in time thru a rift in the fabric of Time.",1310774400,4,468,4.329545454545454
8084302,5,B000BB151G,"This series is, very simply, the most intriguing science fiction show I've ever seen.  Call it a thinking man's Doctor Who - and that's saying a lot because Doctor Who is itself far more than just ray guns and monsters.  There's a definite Doctor Who feel about it - at least early Doctor Who - not so much because of the time travel element, though, as the sets, the costumes, the dialogue and, especially, the pacing of the stories. Some might dismiss this show as being anti-science; but it isn't so much against science as it is cautious about letting science dictate the terms of human existence exclusively.  The two main characters (sixteen year old Simon and fifteen year old Liz), while being allowed to be kids, are also allowed to entertain some rather sophisticated notions about life.  By far the most interesting character is Commander Traynor, whose actions precipatate most of the events; he is what you might call a quasi-villain in that, while he has his own agenda and seems prepared to sacrifice Simon and Liz to fulfill that agenda, he does demonstrate a concern for the two kids' well being.  The least interesting character is Mr. Skinner, Liz's father; he's greatly concerned with Liz and Simon's use of the time portal, but in a rather prosaic way: he thinks it's time for them to put this childish concern with time travel aside and get down to the everyday business of life.  Mrs. Skinner, a clairvoyant who seems to have a telepathic link with her daughter, is fascinating as long as she isn't doggedly accepting her husband's unimaginative view of life.  There are also adult versions of Liz and Simon when the kids travel to the future; Beth, the adult Liz, is particularly intriguing.  But it's definitely the writing that gives Timeslip its edge over virtually every other science fiction show ever created.  The only downside I can think of is how unfortunate it is that you can only find this rare gem of a show by pure chance.",1282780800,6,1961,4.7272727272727275
