8219837,3,B000QGEWI4,"Although I was familiar only with Malin Hartelius and Minowski I had no little anticipation for this DVD; alas except for Hartelius and Minowski I was disappointed. Mozart wrote very difficult music for the two pairs of tenors and two pairs of sopranos, plus a bass with the ability to plumb the depths. Minowski comes off unscathed as does Hartelius; the remainder of the singers are no better than OK--damming with faint praise? My expectations were high because of the production of L'Italiana in Algeri from Aix. There is a lesson to be learned here. What is also irritating is the attempt to ""inject"" humor into the proceedings; it is heavy handed and not remotely funny.

Hartelius is an artist who can achieve greatness in the the repertoire of Schwarzkopf. Her Countess Almaviva in the Zurich Figaro almost matches that of the great German soprano. I am anticipating the new Cosi from Zurich for her Fiordiligi. Minowski's conducting can (eventually) be obtained in an earlier production from Salzburg with Shaffer and Harlelius, a much superior Osmin and Belmonte although the latter omits Ich baue ganze. I trust that this will make its way back to the catalogue. The only ""down side"" to this performance is the inclusion of ""eastern"" music; while I find its inclusion unnecessary a click of the button removes it. An earlier taping of this opera that shouldn't be considered a stop gap is the performance from Sweden. Croft is the tenor and he is wonderful as is the Osmin. The production is amazing considering that the theatre is very small; the Constanze is a Polish soprano who is just south of truly mastering her technique for the role. The tiny orchestra of original instruments play with great precision and enthusiasm. And while the sound may not compare with more current productions it is superior to a more recent taping of Rosenkavalier from Dresden by way of Tokyo in which the sound level is so low that it is necessary to boost the volumn perilously high.",1276646400,,1982,4.846607669616519
8219838,5,B000QGEWI4,"There are four DVD of Entfuhrung with Malin Hartelius.  In two she is Blonde, recorded in 1991 and 1997.  She is Constanza here, recorded in 2004. In addition there is a Region 2 DVD from Zurich recorded in 2003  which I have not heard, other than a clip on line.  This latest 2004 DVD is probably the best one as the Zurich one was conducted by an assistant conductor.

In my opinion, Hartelius is the best Constanza yet, although some might find her high notes too piano.  Whatever is lost dramatically, because of this, is more than made up for by her artistry.  There are lots of vocal colors and dynamics in her very intimate portrayal.  As always her acting is superb.  Magali Leger is a superb Blonde, on the same level as Hartelius in her two earlier DVD.  Klink as Belmonte is also excellent, as he is in the M22 La Finta Semplice, also with Hartelius.  The remaining cast is almost as good.  Minkowski conducts well.

Sound is excellent, although there is no venue acoustic being an outdoor performance.  Some might object to the sound of tree frogs that comes and goes.  This is a part of some outdoor recordings.  In compensation I have never heard the ensembles sound so beautiful before.

Staging concept is somewhat similar to the 1997 Salzburg production in that it brings in some music and chanting from Turkey, that is not Mozart's.  These interuptions are brief and less intrusive in my opinion than the Salzburg 1997 version.  Costumes however are not modernized and are quite elegant.  All in all this is a far better modern version than the M22 2006 Salzburg production.",1197676800,20,1592,4.658273381294964
