Frankly I think this is because it was produced by a German team, and they don't get the French sense of humor.  Is that unfair?  Tough.  If you want to watch an absolutely brilliant movie, get Asterix and Cleopatra, if possible in the 2 DVD set with the extra footage and the ""How the movie was made"" documentary-style film, which is quite fascinating...... it's like a complex military operation.  I believe that the 2 DVD version is only available without subtitiles, but you don't need the subtitles to understand it.",1394668800,,667,4.765217391304348
8032088,4,B0002USZXC,"Asterix et Obelix Contre Cesar brings to the screen a European cartoon/comic all time favorite: Asterix!

Asterix and Obelix have their hands full in trying to save their village from a greedy charlatan who is out to scam the gullible country folk, as well as a power hungry Roman who has his eyes set on the mighty Roman Empire.  If the two Gauls want a fighting chance they must form an alliance with their arch nemesis... Caesar himself!

As a major fan of the comic book I was a little disappointed in that the acting and the dialogues/humor could have been a little better, but the plot, the feel, the setting and music are all pretty good.

Christian Clavier, Gerard Depardieu, and Roberto Benigni are good, but not great.

A Monica Bellucci type actress, like in the outstanding sequel, Asterix and Obelix: Mission Cleopatra would have been perfect.

In all honesty, I'll take the cartoons and the comic books (especially) anytime compared to the film, though if you're an Asterix fan you might want to give it a try.",1161129600,,1024,4.692737430167598
8032089,5,B0002USZXC,"What a FUN movie! Great Special effects and GREAT story! Benigni spontaneity is better then ever. Depardieu always a favorite. The two together are priceless. Make sure you buy a version with English subtitles to thoroughly enjoy the movie, that is if you are not fluent in French....",1111795200,4,284,4.9375
8032090,5,B0002USZXC,Loads of fun. Love Depardieu and Begnini. Bought a version with English subtitles and I LOVE IT!,1111795200,2,96,4.705882352941177
8032091,1,B0002USZXC,"I  was happy to see this in DVD format because I wanted to show it to my classes in French but when it arrived I found it did not have English or any subtitle features.  I could have bought the original VHS, but waited for the DVD for the subtitles.  Dommage.",1103328000,11,259,4.03921568627451
