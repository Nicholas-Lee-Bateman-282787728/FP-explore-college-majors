8169315,2,B000MGVCX6,"I got this soon to be forgotten dvd in hopes of inspiration.  What I received was a nearly quarter century old beta-to-dvd low quality dub.  The laughable gigantic ""swords"" that these chefs used to dice onions was amazing!  I am relatively 100% positive that the restaurants the highlighted haven't been there for quite some time.  Juniper berries? They are so retro!",1259798400,2,367,4.967213114754099
8169316,3,B000MGVCX6,"This was an interesting DVD and was nice to watch for the topic and information.  I liked the tour through Italy and the Food of course, but the narration leaves much to be desired.  She not only is anot able to pronounce the Italian words properly but her voice drones on almost to the point you don't want to watch the rest od the movie. Overall it is interesting and visualy beautiful.  Get it for the food and pictures.",1246579200,4,423,4.329113924050633

8169319,3,B000MGVCX6,"This DVD is more of a travelogue than a ""how to cook it"" presentation. The recipies are presented in a quick, generalized fashion with the moderator mispronouncing common Italian phrases. The types of dishes chosen are authentic and prepared by local chefs. The video redeems itself by visiting the colorful market places of Naples and Palermo and all the beautiful locales of southern Italy and Sicily.",1201392000,9,403,5.121212121212121
