3645518,4,B001HZ4K7Q,"My husband and I watched this over a few nights and we both had bizarre dreams each night!!  I know this show seems cheesy (and it really is at first), but it really pulls you in and creeps you out!!  Love the basic story, characters and the setting.  Strange, but the clothing is almost back in style!",1242777600,7,302,4.2631578947368425
3645519,4,B001HZ4K7Q,"7 episodes, originally filmed for children, star Gareth Thomas as Adam Brake, Astrophysicist, and his son, Matthew, (Peter Demin). They search for modern (1977 standard) clues to standing stones 4000 years old. They find Milbury, a scenic country English village, filled with ""happy day"" families who are not quite normal. The mystery needs solving.

Matthew is the boy for the job, as he has the gift of seeing into time, through mental images. If it begins to seem a bit far-fetched, the film was intended to be supernatural, sinister, spooky, and paranormal, at least for kids. That is similar to another British author, J. M. Barrie, who came up with children stories of the paranormal and time travel in the form of Peter Pan and Wendy and those evil pirates.  Matthew has his own Wendy friend in ""Children of the Stones"". Sandra (Katharine Levy), daughter of the new standing stone museum curator, Margaret (Veronica Strong), sparks Matt's attention, as Margaret does with Adam. Nothing turns into true romance--after all, it was filmed for kids.

Time travel was the basis for another British step through megalithic stones. Diana Gabaldon, author of the popular and lengthy ""Outlander"" series, used gems in place of this story's serpent-designed amulet for protection. Her books, never turned to film, YET, are a bit more believable, if paranormal behavior connected to ancient 2-ton rocks can be normalized. Her books are recommended.

One must keep in mind that this science fiction story was created in 1977 and has the gadgetry and special effects capability of the 70's. So, it looks a bit like the earliest action and suspense of Batman TV series of the late 60s. 21st century computer effects are nonexistent but the nostalgic look at British Sci-Fi of the 70's is now more adult oriented than what was originally intended.

No CC or subtitles found which would have helped with some of the stronger accented cast. They can't always be added to older films. The British had not yet learned that America would like viewing British TV.

Perhaps this is not for everyone, but I was intrigued to continue watching episode after episode without a break.

Episode titles: ""Into the Circle"", ""Circle of Fear"", ""Serpent in the Circle"", ""Narrowing Circle"", ""Charmed Circle"", ""Squaring the Circle"", & ""Full Circle"".

And 7 ""circle"" episodes are rounded out with extras:
  Gareth Thomas interview after 25-30 years with some fun antidotes.
  Director/Producer interview, Peter Graham Scott, who admits that Matthew (Demin) was a beginning actor. It shows in some overacted scenes. But the director was thrilled with the other child stars as well as the noted group of British and Scottish adult leads.

3645520,1,B001HZ4K7Q,"I wish I'd researched this film before I bought it.  While the story idea is fascinating...something weird is going on with the people in a sleepy little English village surrounded by a megalithic stone circle, it turns out to be the most over-the-top, over-acted, dated movie I've seen in many years. There's a reason film-making has advanced beyond this. It is also accompanied by the most melodramatic, annoying sound-track ever. This one should be put in the archives and left there.",1240099200,3,487,5.012345679012346
3645521,5,B001HZ4K7Q,"I received this a few days ago and started watching this today, and I'm happy to say that I am glad this classic mini-series has finally made it to North America!
Of course, I first saw this on Nickelodeon's paranormal anthology series The Third Eye (over 25 years ago). It was such an involving, powerful, and terrifying seven episodes of science meeting mysticism -- and even today it still intrigues and haunts me to this day. Given that this British production is actually just over 30 years old, the video transfer looks quite acceptable (if you can stand good ol' film grain in the film segments, and the videotaped segments look quite good). Good mono audio, too -- in fact, on this DVD, I'm hearing elements that I never heard on the Nick broadcasts (this is a good dual-layer disc). The extra materials are quite good and informative, too.
Definitely recommend this to others who know and love this classic. If this sells well enough, we'll also get ""Into The Labyrinth"" from Acorn Media.",1232150400,31,997,4.735632183908046
3645522,4,B001HZ4K7Q,"I am in my 30's now and one day in a conversation about scary movies and sci-fi I remembered the old shows that scared the heck out of me as a kid. It was on Nickelodeon (kids world my ass) on Saturday afternoon and was called The Third Eye. I was very glad to find these and view them again, there is something intriguing about British Sci-Fi. There are seven episodes, a Professor and his son move into town to investigate the mystery of the legendary standing stones, which are arranged in a way that just gives you chills. The town has the happy locals and the unhappy, or is it suspecting others of the town who know that something else is going on, I cant find a way for a basic plot in a paragraph.
  I was just glad to find this again, I will look for Into The Labyrinth and Under The Mountain. Honestly I am not sure if I would be as interested unless I was Re-Living a childhood memory.",1389398400,2,896,4.173410404624278
3645523,1,B001HZ4K7Q,"This is no more than a cheaply-made, dated, meandering pseudo-soap opera type production in which the story is utterly predictable and the acting, with one exception, is no better than high school level; amateurish and hard to watch.  The exception is, of course, Gareth Thomas who strives to do his best with very thin material and dialog that is mainly exposition.  The supernatural elements are cliched and so very poorly done in what appear to be budgetless special effects.  This might be a childen's story, it's difficult to tell as the point of view is often muddled and chaotic.  This is simply a mess and a hugh disappointment.",1388448000,,636,4.861111111111111
3645524,3,B001HZ4K7Q,"If you can get past the horrific wailing passed off as title music and the thick 1970's ambiance you might find this British series an amusing diversion.
The story line has a college professor and his teen son arriving at a small town to study the large standing stone circle which surrounds it.  They soon find out that this Avebury like town is divided into 'happy' locals and less happy newcomers.  The son joins forces with other less happy residents and try to solve the mystery that seems to come from the stones themselves.
This is only seven short episodes but the story evolves and comes to completion in those few episodes with reasonable results.  The acting is good and story is creative.",1377388800,,700,4.67479674796748
3645525,3,B001HZ4K7Q,"Very British and very slow circa 1977.  The premise is interesting--pagans, sacred stones, cyclical time and the music is oddly alluring.  It is largely made up of human voices--or at least sounds--moans, cries, unintelligible whispers.  But alas, this television mini series lacks coherency and the intricacies necessary to make the plot flow.  The cover touts it as a cult classic, but this cult classic would benefit by a remake that includes some CGi and rewriting that might make it more exciting to a 21st century audience.",1374019200,,529,5.116279069767442
3645526,5,B001HZ4K7Q,"The Children of the Stones is a British children's miniseries (seven half-hour episodes) not produced by the BBC, but by one of the forerunners of ITV. Made in the late 1970s, it features the sort of clothes and hairdos you'd expect from the time. The story itself has a bit of timelessness about it and the show makes for entertaining watching even now, 35 years later.

An astrophysicist, Adam Brake, comes to the town of Milbury to fulfill a grant studying magnetic fields at the local neolithic monuments. The town has a stone circle that dates back to at least 3000 BC. The circle is enormous--it encloses the whole town.

He's a widower and has brought his only son Matthew, who is prone to psychic visions of the past, present, and future They drive into town with some typical father-son banter. All of the sudden, there's an old women in the road. They break quickly and discover that she is the caretaker of their bed and breakfast. The local lord told her they were arriving and she had come out to greet them. At least that's her explanation. The lord comes to visit and seems a little odd. The local people also are rather quaint, always greeting one another with ""Happy day!"" Small town friendliness comes off a bit creepy and it's not just unfamiliarity with local customs.

Another recent arrival is Margaret, a widow with a daughter about Matthew's age. They've been here for a while and feel a little isolated since they are not part of the ""Happy Day"" crew. She's curator of the local museum and knows a bit of folklore about the stones, including that they are the center of 53 different lay lines (which are lines between various neolithic sites that are claimed to have psychic energy running along them). There are 53 stones still standing in the circle. And now 53 citizens of Milbury since Adam and Matthew have arrived. Cue the creepy music.

The music is one of the distinctive features of the show. The score is dominated by spooky chanting that uses groans, moans, shrieks, and a wordless soprano line to enhance the atmosphere. It seems a little heavy-handed at times but is effective. It also mirrors the pre-historic mysteriousness of what's going on.

The visuals are uneven. The production is from the 1970s--the interiors are videotaped on sound stages and the exteriors are filmed in the town of Avebury (which has a real, ancient, and enormous stone circle around it). The difference is noticeable but I found I was able to tune it out. The special effects are few and far between--some work well, others are a bit low tech.

On the other hand, the performances are uniformly good. Given the science fiction and horror elements, a few performances and reactions are stylized but it fits the story. Even though it was made as a children's show, the actors take it seriously.

Like the best of children's entertainment, the show is also entertaining for adults as well. The story is well told, intelligent, and challenging. The science is accurate enough without being difficult to follow. The mystery of the town is slowly if not completely revealed, making it intriguing watching the first time. The ending is a bit ambiguous but of the sort that makes for interesting discussions (rather than frustrating bewilderment). And when I watched it a second time, I noticed a lot more of the details foreshadowing what would happen. It's much like watching The Sixth Sense a second time. Children of the Stones isn't as good as The Sixth Sense, but it does fall in a similar genre and would be enjoyed by the same fans.",1354492800,,3550,4.73462783171521
3645527,5,B001HZ4K7Q,"Milbury, a tiny little English town, which would seem to be the best place to retire.  A wonderful town full of history, with a nice little museum, a nice little pub, lots of nice happy people, and even a nice little cirle of megalithic stone.  And everybody is so Happy.
The story is, frankly, every new age idea ever from the 70's, sans UFOs.  Anicent power, druid-inspired magic, black holes, everything has been tossed into the pot to make sci-fi drama that forces one to watch it again and again.  Of course, it also helps to have seen it as a kid.  And also to have visited Avebury where the story was filmed.  Avebury's cirle is even older than that of Stonehenge and really gives the series a dark, haunting feel.
I like the way Adam Brake, played by Gareth Thomas, tries to explain everything that is happening with reason and logic.  It really gives the story a nice, grounded, almost realtisic feel as he, and his son, use science and math to try to piece together what is going on.
174 minutes, 7 episodes in all, with great actors, a wonderful vocal score, and a solid story.

3645528,3,B001HZ4K7Q,"I watched this in one sitting (it helped to use the ""skip"" button on the DVD remote to jump over the running of the credits after each episode.  I also used the fast forward a lot to alleviate having to sit through the cliffhangers that ended one episode then were repeated for the start of the next).  Even so, it was still overlong and tended to drag in places when the story wasn't advanced quickly enough.  It felt like they were killing time.....a lot.
The film transfer is horrific for the location shots but pristine for the interiors.  This was especially jarring when the actors walk inside from one of their frequent strolls.  Some of the nighttime sequences were impossible to make out: dark on dark with layers of more dark, and some motion.  I knew something was happening from that incessant caterwauling, I just couldn't see what.
I felt a lot of the story was stubbornly obtuse, floundering with grand ideas it couldn't really articulate.  It tried so hard to be sinister and creepy (less Village of the Damned and more H.R. Pufnstuf).  That was it biggest failing, it tried too hard with actors not quite up to the task of conveying the necessary eeriness required.  Instead, most of them came across as simply daffy, not ""happy.""  The unseen choir wasn't much of a help either with establishing a sinister tone.  I had to fight the impulse to hit the mute button every time they started that grotesque wailing they called singing!
When the story slowly travailed to its unsatisfactory conclusion, all I was left with was the sense that in better hands this might have been something truly special.  A classic, this isn't.
Still, I'm glad I saw it and don't begrudge the time it took to see it through.  But it's not something I'd ever want to watch again.",1311033600,,1773,4.644230769230769
3645529,5,B001HZ4K7Q,"Very enjoyable, if somewhat dated, sci-fi mini-series from the 70s.  This show is classified as a children's program but I think adults will enjoy it as much as any child.  Gareth Thomas (Blake's 7) plays lead and does an excellent job as does the actor who plays his son.  I was drawn into the mystery from the very first episode.  The story is made up of 7 24 minute shows, each part ending in a cliff-hanger much like the Doctor Who stories made during this time.  If I had to say one bad thing it would be that they didn't really explain everything in the end to my satisfaction but one can make reasonable guesses about them.  This is a rare gem of a show that I had never heard of and just happened to stumble upon.  Recommended.",1305849600,,735,4.282608695652174
3645530,5,B001HZ4K7Q,"This mid seventies classic really hold up well. It's intriguing and well acted. This film utilizes both film stock and taped interior set work.  The story once  you get started is hard to stop watching. What's going on in the ancient village?
Why are people acting like robotic happy people. why do the stones seem to be magnetic and standing inward? are they really people turned to stone?  This also features incredible choral music that lends itself to incredible moody filmwork.
The stones seem to take on personalities when this music is playing. The guy who didn't like it probably listens to todays fake music like hip hop. That music has no soul and is without originality.  The film looks great and the print is great shape , which is a lucky thing because if you have seen other tv shows from that era many seem rather scratched up. A good example of this is 'flickers"" from bbc in 1980, a great movie but it has many lines through it on dvd.  I am glad I got this one because it remains a original effort in style and music that really appeals to me.  A true classic tv sci fi show that influenced many shows to come. It's also pretty cool to see those  seventies clothes and hair styles.  Those shaggy hair days are better left behind  , even older people went rather unstyled and long in the hair department, but the great music and tv shows live on!",1275004800,4,1363,4.4417670682730925
3645531,4,B001HZ4K7Q,"I remember reading somewhere the Children of the Stone was among the 3 or 4 series that inspired LOST.  And I enjoyed watching this series looking for the similarities:
- Milbury = the island in Lost
- The Doctor and his son = the Dharma initiative that goes to the island to study the effect of the extreme magnetism.
- The villagers = the Others
- The doctor in the village complains that nobody gets sick in the village = People heal faster in the island in Lost.
- New people arriving to the village somehow turn ""weird"" and they call it as getting infected or sick.  They same in Lost.
- In both Lost and children of the stones the conversion of new people to ""Other"" occurs inside a temple""
- The village and Lost both have something that surrounds it and does not allow people to leave.

8310066,5,B001HZ4K7Q,"One of the classic television dramas, Children of the Stones combines science, technology, mysticism and archaeology into one very potent package. People who have seen it rarely forget it. Some of the acting was a little off, mostly by the kids, but it's a very difficult piece to pull off. The special effects were a little cheesy, but we're talking the early 1970s. We're also talking about a British production, where the emphasis has always been on the writing. The writing was magnificent. I would have liked to have seen what was cut out, there are always cuts, but I imagine those parts have long-since vanished. A special edition seems unlikely.",1483488000,,653,4.891891891891892
8310067,5,B001HZ4K7Q,"I first watched this TV series as a kid, growing up in the UK in the 1970s. I liked it then & having just watched it straight again, some 40 years later, I still like it. I am glad that even though I did read the reviews here, I trusted more to my memory than to the few less kind takes I read. Bear in mind, this was filmed in the 1970s as a show for kids for the after school slot. Ok, they were bright kids, but there are no computer generated effects. How could there possibly be? There were no computers capable of that at the time! As to ""Poor Quality"", well, both indoor (studio) shots & those out on location in Avebury (very near Stonehenge) were just fine on an LCD TV supported by a Sony 4K upscaling player - bought via Amazon by the way. The quality is fine, I guess it does not play well on a 30 buck player from Walmart but really, what will? In short, I am very happy with this this disk,

I only wish I had found it years back. For a genuinely strange, resourceful show, this is a good one. If you want special effects (& no real plot?) look elsewhere. To me, well worth FIVE stars",1458345600,6,1098,4.036697247706422

8310071,5,B001HZ4K7Q,"This classic show from my childhood is special for so many reasons: I remember watching it on the weekends, discussing it with my school friends, and simply being terrified of the sinister music and the creepy nature of the story. Years later, I found it on Youtube and then realized it is also available on Amazon. It is one of the many quality children's dramas of my childhood and I am now happy that I get to share it with my daughter.

The story features astrophysicist Adam Brake and his young son, Matthew who arrive in the small town of Milbury which just so happens to be within a megalithic stone circle. To add to the high atmosphere, filming actually took place at the Avebury stone circle so it really adds a sense of authenticity. A creepy atmosphere is maintained throughout the story and even though the production details are very dated by today's standards, I found myself still enjoying it and really got back into the plot. Compared to the insipid children's productions on American TV these days, ""Children of the Stones"" is a breath of fresh air, dated though it may be.",1426982400,,1092,4.628865979381444
8310072,5,B001HZ4K7Q,"Spooky fun filmed in a real English village that has rows of standing stones right in the middle of it.  Hokey theme music, but it was apparently an after-school special-type series.",1417392000,,182,4.870967741935484
8310073,5,B001HZ4K7Q,"I first viewed ""children of the stones"" when I was 6 and it had been included as part of Nickelodeon's ""the third eye"" anthology series that showed children's shows that dealt with the supernatural or more specifically psychic phenomena. Being 1983 (I believe) this 1976 production didn't look dated to me at age 6 and the fact that it's British lent the show a degree of sophistication in my young mind.

The plot is fairly simple. A professor and his young son have travelled to a  creepy fictitious village (real life Avebury) where the professor has received a grant to study the strange stones that dot the village and surrounding area. Upon their arrival some of the villagers appear to behave in a unique manner. Many proclaim they are quite happy all the time. At the school some of the young students are able to easily complete math problems that scientist may struggle to solve. The longer the professor and his son stay in the village they notice that there is a correlation between the stones, people's behavior and a curious painting that came into their possession,

I bought this DVD on a whim to see if it ""held up"" 30 years later. As a child I didn't truly understand all the science or psychic theories going on but still enjoyed the show. Would this show hold up? The answer is a resounding yes. The show's opening them  is still eerie with its creepy human vocals layered over each other while we are shown various desolate stones scattered throughout Avebury. The production istself is dated now using the old British technique of filming in video tape in side studios and film for outside shots. And of course the fashions decidedly 1970s. However, none of that really marred my enjoyment and actually made me enjoy this a bit more. Children of the Stones covers a lot of ideas such as Druids, psychic abilities, time continuums, mind manipulation but it does it quite effectively without bogging the story or the viewer with lots of scientific Mumbo jumbo.

I recommend this!",1416009600,,1999,4.732758620689655
