7342498,5,B0122YCUHC,"I love a good cartoon even if it based on a video game, which I did not know or care about. This story reminded me of a ""Lord of the Rings"" type of story about a diverse group on a quest. We have humans, mercenaries, elves, sorceress, priest, and a few surprises. The characters were fun and very well defined. the story is terrific and it was just a good old time. I would not recommend for very young kids, the bad dragon is pretty scary but it is wonderful.",1447286400,,460,4.122222222222222

7342500,3,B0122YCUHC,"This review is from a 35 year old.  I thought the animation was very good,  and it was like a mash - up of Lord of the Rings meets Final Fantasy.  I particularly enjoyed the elf archery scenes.  The problem with this movie is that it couldn't decide if it wanted to be tailored to kids or teens.  Lots of action and battle scenes and characters die in battle, but no blood is shown.  One minute, it's like your watching an anime and the next it's like a Disney movie on Saturday morning. Would love to see an animated fantasy film geared towards adults.",1446249600,,553,4.269230769230769
7342501,4,B0122YCUHC,"Very nice story,  Didn't  like it quite as much as either of the ""How to Train Your Dragon's""  however it was very nice,  Yes I bought  this DVD after watching it",1446163200,,162,4.096774193548387
7342502,5,B0122YCUHC,"were to start this movie has everything action good story the movie starts out giving a breif history of the world altera (hope i spelled that right) then opens with a nice action sequence. several warriors ranging from fighters, magic users, archers, and clerics embark on a jounrey to destrpy a dark dragon and remove the source of its power a magic gem. This film has a lot of lord of the rings elements to it except their is a gem instead of the ring of power. My only real problem was that the battle scene (army vs army type of battle scene)was too short. Their is an army vs army battle scene in the movie but it only lasts for a short time but other then that it is a great film.will be watching it again in the future.",1444953600,,727,4.2
7342503,5,B0122YCUHC,"Just watched it from redbox, and going to buy it. Yes it had a little parts that reminded me of LotR but  it had it's own life too it, it also reminded me of lotos wars anime mainly Parn and Didlit  the elf princess he falls in love with, with fish being - parn the new good wants to make a name for himself warrior and didlit being the smart ass funny always there to show him up but in a good way elf. The final battle was a good scene not like some movies where the final battle has left us in a WTF state, this had great action to it and not knowing anything of the game or ever heard of this series, I am impressed and it will be a welcomed addition to my movie library.",1444867200,2,675,3.8489208633093526
7342504,4,B0122YCUHC,"This is a Middle Earth style story with humans, elves, dragons, orc-gremlins, etc. No Hobbits. The film has humans and elves uniting to fight beasts and the dragon. There is no ring, but a magical gem. Much of the dialogue and scenes came from the Peter Jackson production. Our main human emulated Legolas in many of his deeds.

The animation looked great. The story was great, unfortunately it has already been done. After the kids watch this one, they should be ready for a LOTR film festival. The characters okay. A decent film if you don't expect or crave originality. 3 1/2 stars",1440201600,,584,4.669902912621359
7342505,4,B0122YCUHC,"As a 23 year old, this movie was much more enjoyable than I thought it would be. What interested me about this movie was that I've played Dragon Nest in the past and I was interested to see what the movie would be like. Don't worry if you've never played Dragon Nest before, you do not need to know the story of the game in order to follow along in this movie. Everything was explained well enough throughout the movie that you will follow along just fine. To start off, I should warn you that there are deaths in this movie, but the fighting and deaths scenes are very contained. What I mean by that is when a character is cut, they do not show any blood or the wound and they do not die in any gruesome type of way. The atmosphere, character, and the cartoon style sort of resembles How To Train Your Dragon in many ways. If I had to choose something memorable, I would have to say the music really stood out the most. They did a great job of creating the atmosphere and setting the mood for most scenes.

There are a couple of things that I didn't like. It might be nitpicking since it's just a children's movie, but I feel like they could've done much better on some things. First of all, the whole story developed at a very fast pace, so fast that there was no room left for character development at all. Whatever character development did happen was only focused entirely around the main character. However, because of the fast pace, they were able to squeeze in a lot of enjoyable action scenes. Secondly, it was painfully obvious who the bad guys were. The stereotype of bad guys wear black clothing were very prominent in this movie.

In conclusion, this movie has pretty much everything you want in a children's action movie. Swords, magic, princesses, warriors, fighting, and DRAGONS!!!!",1439424000,4,1798,4.478658536585366

7342507,5,B0122YCUHC,"It was a good movie, LOTR meets Final Fantasy is a good description like many have said. I will say this that if your wondering what the rating is, its unrated, but looks PG right? well it is mostly a kids film but has a long of thong shots of the elvs (which I don't mind at all) and some very sexy korean-anime style designs. There is no cursing, or nudity but expect some panty shots while the elf chicks are running and a scene early on where the young boy goes face first into an elf girls chest.

The movie is NOT afraid to show a little panty here and there, so keep that in mind if you are a parent. That said nothing is inherently sexual other than showing a lot of skin and the elfs looking generally very sexy (as female elfs tend to do in about any medium),

Also, My iTunes and Vudu (you can pick between a few on the non itunes side) code worked. Cant say yours will but there is still a chance but for how long I don't know, don't buy this expecting the codes to work however.",1476748800,2,991,4.051020408163265

7342517,1,B0122YCUHC,"Very hard to sit and watch this one, even though the visuals are really nice.
Kids are likely to enjoy it more then us adults so take my review as more for adults.

ACTION ACTION ACTION!
It's just too over the top action. These kinds of movies and games are becoming all to prevalent these days. The cliches so abounding in this one... so very abundant, I felt like you already seen this 1000 times.
OF course everyone has the strength of 10 gorillas, can move super fast, can defy gravity, is the most amazing ultra uber magnificent grand master fantastic fighter ever, while also a master trickster. I am so sick of this trope. I am so sick of it. I cannot stand this anymore. Come back down to earth, be more realistic, and instantly you have a much better movie! If everyone is a superhero your movie is BORING! Might as well have every character in a blue suit with a big S knitted on the chest, with a flowing cape. All this does is make every action scene the most mindless of things, and much of this movie was these boring action scenes. No disrespect to super-man franchise actually, even he is much more down to earth then the characters of this film.

I can see in 25 years from now, every action movie will have so many over the top action and effects, it will be indistinguishable from just watching white fuzz static on an old television. Ironically, that is more fun then watching Dragon Nest. At least my imagination can then imagine a better movie then!

FINE STORY TELLING-
The boy is fighting goblins, surrounded by them, which normally is somehow not a problem for him, but suddenly he decides it's a problem because ""movie plot"" or something... They are about to ""get him"" then suddenly a huge chain and anchor swings down with the voice of God? saying he hates unfair odds or something like that... Huh?

First of all what the heck is this movie about, what is going on? why should I care even? then this happens? uhhhhg.... So unwatchable... The kid magically rides this fast moving chain and ends up on a floating airship *uhhhg* with again the booming voice sorta teasing him. For having saved his life, the boy sure seems angry about all this and tries to find him to fight him. Do I even need to continue? This movie is so darn stupid and I hate their characters right from the get go.

THE UNDER-QUALIFIED BOY FALLS FOR FOR THE UNTOUCHABLE, INFALLIBLE GIRL CLICHE!

How typical... The clumsy yet also capable arrogant hero boy falls in love for hot girl who is much more reserved, mature, even more capable *so the boy is like 2 supermans, but she is like 10*. She resists but by the end of the movie they fall in love or something whatever...
I HATE THIS TROPE. Why does every movie have to do this now? It's so overused in Hollywood.

I hate it.

Why do they keep making movies that do this overused junk? Why do people keep watching them? I won't watch another minute of it, I shouldn't have to pay for films like this, you should pay me a wage to sit and watch it, because it's that bad.

Mindless, cliche ridden, trope abusing, pile of garbage, yet everybody seems to love it, and that just burns me inside =D. This world is doomed!",1453593600,,3166,4.416809605488851

7342519,3,B0122YCUHC,"Surprisingly a decent movie. Us adults got this to keep an 8-year-old girl entertained while hoping it would be interesting enough to give us something to enjoy. We probably ended up enjoying it much more than she did. That might indicate the characters and events are more fitting for a tween audience as there are some events that might not hit home with younger ones.

The story is some relatively generic fantasy fare with swords and sorcery and dragons. The characters are likable enough, but development will feel rushed as the cast is relatively large and what at first appear as supporting characters partially through the film end up playing an important role in the plot, but the lead characters might grow on you. Scrappy kid wants to be a hero, scrappy kid meets girl, then they go on an adventure with a varied cast, dragons, and then more dragons. If you are looking for something that goes beyond it's trappings and says something about the human condition or is a cinematic tapestry of beauty, this isn't it. What it is is a fairly sincere story of adventure, love, and sacrifice told in a way that turns out to be good popcorn entertainment. Probably good for fans of RPGs, Anime, and Tolkienesque stuff if you're the type of fan who could only watch the movies. The Simarillion this is not.",1452902400,,1308,4.6869565217391305

It shows that people of different races, different backgrounds and culture can put aside their differences and come together  help each other to  fight a great evil.
Hope Amazon will get the other two movie sequel in their inventory soon.
Also this is a great love story as far as I'm concerned it rates among the great romantic couples throughout history.
I guess I'm a little bit a romantic at heart.

8725234,3,B0122YCUHC,"The fact that it is the movie of my favorite mmorpg gives it a special place in my heart. Unfortunately, as a movie, it overall did not meet my standards of an amazing film. All of the elements were present but in short amounts. Everything seemed rushed, so much so that I did not grow no form of attachment towards the main character nor any of the other characters including the poochums ( number 1 and number 2). This movie could've been up to 3 hours with the amount of information that was being thrown at us. So much was introduced that if one did not know the game itself, they would surely be lost. I still liked the basis of the movie, but the content in it should have been set with more fluent motion and time to let the elements and information sink into our hearts and minds.",1489276800,,788,4.26

8725236,2,B0122YCUHC,"I bought this for the 3D, which is listed as a feature on the back. I have a ton of 3D Blu-Ray titles in my library (most of those released, to date), so I know 3D pretty well.  This 3D is poorly rendered. There are inverted portions throughout the movie (the part that should be coming to the foreground is pushed back, and that which should be in the background has been pushed forward to the front). It appears to be a rush job.  When this occurs, it is difficult to watch. Another title that is even worse for this is Spy Kids Game Over, where this issue plagues the entire movie significantly.
It's too bad, really, as if a bit more care were given to this title, this could have been a 4 star review.",1479945600,2,706,4.1838235294117645
