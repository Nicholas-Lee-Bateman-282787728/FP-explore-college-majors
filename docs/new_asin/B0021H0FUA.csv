8349032,5,B0021H0FUA,"I bought ""Tears of April"" through www.amazon.de and obtained a DVD with English subtitles and no Region Code (i.e. Region Code 0). Set in the Finnish Civil War (1918) the story follows the novel of writer Leena Lander.
Translated exerpt of the German back cover: ""The times are rough and contaminated by an icy hatred. The conservative Whites have defeated the socialist Reds and confined them in camps. In one of these camps the imprisoned ""red"" woman Miina meets the young ambitious soldier Aaro from the Whites. Believing in a ""higher"" (level) of justice Aaro makes a solitariy decision in order to save the woman from execution. He convoys her from his unit to a distant drumhead court-martial. At the same time being saver and deadly enemy (of Miina) Aaro escorts the reticent and hostile Miina through the Finnish back-country. An attempt of Miina to escape makes capsize the boat they are under way. Grounding on an uninhabitated island they are suddenly faced with the struggle of (physical) survival and now depending on each other. During that period on the island they develop a strong mutual attraction. But soon after leaving the island their recently achieved confidence will be challenged. The soldier Aaro has to decide between his soldierly duty and his emotions.""
Aaro's high ideals about soldierly duty AND pure love lead him into a dilemma. The believable straight forward story is so intensively presented that its almost unbearable.",1311292800,3,1454,5.0625
