3563352,5,B001F2U6X8,love the series very sad it never got to end. but that's how it is. this is an up dated verson of the old series just to let you people out their know this is not the orginal series. but this box set have so much to offer to a hard core fan i good buy in my book.,1280966400,,263,3.4745762711864407
3563353,5,B001F2U6X8,"I am a HUGE Guyver fan I have always been. I found this at a DVD shop down in FOrt Gordon Georgia while I was in-Army-Advanced Individual Training (AIT). Excellant I was very pleased when I got it I had to watch it first chance I got, but my computer sucked for some reason and I had to wait until I got home 9 months later!!! :(  But When I got home I did watch it and it was superb. A great as I thought it was going to be as I've seen the first half as rentals from Block Buster before I left for Basic Training in 2008. Years later I still watch the entire series in one sitting. I love Guyver one of the greatest series out there it had inspired me in my writing so much.

Although I don't understand the difference in the two box sets: Guyver: The Complete Series (Viridian Collection). I don't get it they both half the same amount of DVDs in the collection and the only difference is the Viridian Collection has 50 more mins of play time. Of what I cannot say as I own this box set version. Their both from Funimation Productions. So whats the difference? Can someone enlighten me on the topic?",1279497600,,1102,4.144859813084112
3563354,3,B001F2U6X8,"The only way for me to criticize this series properly is to delve into the plot details, so you can take this as a spoiler alert if you want, however, I'll avoid getting into specifics as much as I possibly can. First, I'd like to go into what I actually liked about the series - the dubbing and animation are actually superior to the original anime, and that's about all the praise I can give.

So what didn't I like? Understand, I've watched the first twelve episodes of the original series, and as you may be aware, only the first twelve episodes were released in the U.S. Despite its flaws, I actually think the original series is vastly superior. Admittedly, the dubbing from the original Guyver was a constant annoyance, but the action sequences were much, much more enjoyable. If you've watched Dragon Ball Z or Yu Yu Hakusho, I can't help but to think that you would be disappointed by this series; I'm not saying that those series don't have their flaws, but at least they deliver in the action department. Furthermore, having to endure Mizuki's incessant crying only becomes more and more irritating as the episodes wear on.

Technical criticisms aside, I'd like to switch focus to some of the meatier flaws that Guyver has to offer - the Guyvers are weak, plain and simple. You might take notice of this, starting with Enzyme's debut appearance. After his loss to Enzyme, Guyver 1 manages to recover, but he never actually gets any stronger until the LAST EPISODE of the series, and he's the only one! In fact, the good guys spend most of the series HIDING from the villains and just trying to survive. The Guyvers also fail to do any lasting damage to Cronos, and by the end of the series, Cronos actually achieves world domination! The major villain throughout most of the anime wasn't defeated by the Guyvers - he was defeated by... his boss. The Guyvers just didn't have the power or ability to defeat someone that strong. By the time Guyver 1 acquires his newfound powers, he doesn't use them to put an end to Cronos; no, that would make too much sense. Instead, he vanquishes a mere henchman, and the series comes to a close. You know, I like underdogs as much as the next guy, but the Guyvers really aren't heroes - they're whipping boys. I wanted to like this series and have been fascinated with its concept for a while, but if you HAVE to watch it, rent it first.",1278633600,,2384,4.554778554778554

3563356,5,B001F2U6X8,As soon as I got Guyver I started watching it and I love it. This is one anime I had never watched before and now I really like it. I would recommend this anime to anyone who is a fan of anime.,1274313600,,193,3.619047619047619
3563357,5,B001F2U6X8,I have been a fan of Guyver since my dad had introduced me to it when I was 5(weird I know). This version of Guyver is uncut and uncensored so all fans will be happy; especially since funimation tends to censor many of its animes. The 4 disc case contains all 26 episodes the range from chapter 1-65 in the manga and is completely canon with a few minor alterations that do not affect the plot(simple changes to characters and events).,1274140800,,435,4.382716049382716
3563358,5,B001F2U6X8,"Background you can skip
I was, as a teen, captured by the Guyver Manga comics which, back then, were really hard to get (I lived in Holland and it was the 80's). Somehow my older brother was able to get them and shared them with me. Then, a few years after, I got Guyver on video (the first anime of this series). It really brought Guyver to life for me and I became a big fan. Naturally I also got the Guyver feature movies on video but that is a whole other story and I will not go into that here. To make a long story short: this is a remake of the original Anime of Guyver that, I believe, stems back to the mid 80's. This remake was done in 2005.
The story is brutal and intriguing as it progresses through increasing levels of attack and opponents that get stronger by the episode. It's never clear upfront whether Guyver will or will not win and the story does not get repetitive. There are a few 'quiet' episodes but overall this series deserves the large fan base and the remake.

About this 2005 remake of Guyver:Bioboosted Armor
Here are a few key anime stats that might satisfy those shopping for this item:
- 26 episodes
- total of 625 minutes of anime
- 4 DVD's in a single cover
- you can have as English or Japanese voice over
- TVMA: yes, I know Funimation tends to clean up gore, but this series was left intact. The blood flows richly, bodies get sliced in half and heads are blown off. Not for kids. Note that I bought the item on Amazon advertised as the Viridian Collection, in case Amazon switches pics or items. TVMA= TV Mature Audience

About the actual anime
For those of you that never saw the original series: this one is at a faster pace and much more gory. The English voice acting is actually very very good. Even the cheesy Chronos guys have ther share of Scottish and Aussie accents in some cases (although dubbed through sound effects.

*****START OF SPOILER ALERT******
This series, in case you do not know this, has received one key piece of criticism... it does not really end... it does not conclude. I never really got upset with that and it does not take away from the story. Some might want it to end with a true conclusion and the demise of Chronos, Guyver or both but it remains open. And with a bit of imagination you can see that it could actually have been meant as a conclusion. Perhaps some day someone will actually create the anime/manga conclusion that us westerners want... I do think it is possibly a cultural difference with the Japanese story tellers and the western audience as the ending seems to be a non-issue with the Asian audiences in general. Take this as you will: the ending is satisfactory and does not reduce the value of the series. At least it was not a quick-n-dirty Dalles style (remember Dallas?) ending where someone wakes up and it was all a dream (ie. a dirt cheap 5 minute cop out ending).
*****END OF SPOILER ALERT******

Conclusion:
- Guyver never gets old: the story is pure manga, so a real must have for people looking for great entertainment. 625 minutes for 35 dollars is a great bargain
- You will watch this again periodically
- Now that my kids are older they have taken a real liking to it and anime in general
- If liked Samurai 7 (another awesome anime) then you will love this",1262044800,20,3266,4.375617792421746
3563359,3,B001F2U6X8,"Most people who come into this most recent Guyver series, has probably been witness to the glory of the classic Guyver ovas and movies from the early 90s. Though, nothing made has really caught up with the original manga. All 3 guyver movies had mostly conclusions in them, but only the OAV movie even resembled the manga at all.

Well here comes the new series, hoping either to catch up or even conclude the guyver series. Though....does it succeed? Kindof, but not really. As of now, there are 26 manga books out for the guyver, and this series only goes up to the 10th. Anybody who has watched the original series from the 90s will figure out, this series doesn't go much farther than it honestly. While yes sure, this does very much so follow the manga, but thats ultimately its downfall as well. Think of a normal shonen like a dbz, sailor moon, or inuyasha where you can just about predict everything. If a battle can't be won, some new technique has to be used. There just really isn't a sense of emotion or a connection. Though if you watch the original series, everything just seemed to blend in. It felt more like a Berserk or Ninja scroll than dragonball. Not saying its bad this way, its just never really exciting.

Which mentioning more comparisons to dragonball, this series has a dramatic loss in gore. The oav and the ovas were some of the most gory animation you could ever watch. Arms flying off left and right, a few snipits of nudity, and some mild cussing. Though, this is toned down for more of a early teenage audience. Of course, its not pokemon or anything, but you'll deffinately notice the difference. Its almost bothersome actually.

Though, here comes the most bothersome thing about this set. Be prepared to turn on the japanese audio, even if you HATE subs. Yes, I do like english dubs for the most part. Though, this is PATHETIC! Just go search up the next episode previews for instance. The actor sounds BORED TO DEATH! Though ADV originally produced this anime, and they are notorious for bad dubs but nothing this bad. If only funimation went back and redubbed the whole series...

Keeping in line with audio though, the music. Well, its kindof dissapointing. The opening song Waiting for.. isn't too bad, although the singer sounds a bit bored. Though the ending song, is HORRIBLE! Its something you would think to have in a inuyasha. Anybody who remotely knows guyver should know, it doesn't focus on any big love storys. Sure, there is one, but it doesn't force it on you. Well, the background music is ultimately a disaster. Every anime now seems to have to have a big orchestra. Think of something like Rocky, where theres a big build up and then it hits you hard emotionally. The original series, oav movie, and guyver 2 did a great job doing that. Though...this series always tries to have real heavy ballad music, but it ultimately makes you not care about it at all.

So ultimately, I'd give this a rental or a borrow. Its certainly worth 1 or 2 viewings for the story alone, but not worth keeping in your collection. Its certainly not the worst thing out there, its just compared to anything guyver related before it, its disappointing.",1250812800,4,3183,4.636524822695035
3563360,1,B001F2U6X8,"I guess I'm the only reviewer who actually bought the dvd set. I am a huge fan of the old series and I bought this new one hoping for more of the same, it had a TVMA rating so I had my hopes up. Turns out this dvd release is an extremely tamed down version of the show, it's a Funimation release after all. Remember watching DBZ on Cartoon Network and they would cut away any time someone was about to get punched and only show the reaction shot? Yeah, a lot of the same here. I am totally disappointed. Thanks to all the piracy websites out there I can't even find a thread of people talking about whether or not this is a censored release or if it was really animated without any ultraviolence.

Anyway, if you want Guyver for what it used to be, skip this. If you're cool with the made for tv guyver, snatch it up. The dvd is still good for what it is, but it's not what it's supposed to be.",1242950400,7,894,4.0508474576271185
3563361,4,B001F2U6X8,"This latest version of Guyver is truely a MAGNIFICANT work of anime.  I enjoyed the revision of the story line.  It does answer alot of questions I had before, but now my questions have been answered and explained somethings that I missed.  The main music theme for The Guyver, Waiting For... by Yo Reiri, is HOT.  I loved this song so much that I actually bought the soundtrack and play this song at least four times daily.  But I wish the Japanesse writers would continue this version with an conclusional ending.  I think its kind of crude to remake the Guyver,each time, only to add more details about the characters lives and not come forth with an ending.  I have been a FAN of anime since 1990 and love every year of it, but recently each anime have been increasingly known to stop without a conclusion.  Its beginning to get irritating.  Although irritated, I will always LOVE anime and The Guyver.",1238457600,,906,4.577639751552795

3563431,4,B001F2U6X8,"Story - aliens existed before long ago. Yep, definitely fits with alot of stories in anime out there. Guyver definitely makes itself unique in by having not only aliens that have died, but an evil organization based around these older aliens that have been using mankind as some sort test bed/guinea pig project. Awesome fights and power ups ahead of you here. The whole ding for this whole animation is the non-completion of it. It just dumps you on a cliff hangar at the end. More or less the manga is finish and will eventually get a reboot to finish the whole series. Ps... I hope.

Animation - Fluid and fast. The voices sync up nicely with the characters and the alien/human hybrids look out of this world. This anime definitely deserves a spot in collection just for the animation's goriness.

Voice acting - Top notch and makes the whole scenes just make you wait in anticipation of what's going to be revealed.",1454025600,,919,4.631901840490798

The ending doesn't leave you hanging quite as much as the OVA series did, although it still leaves much to be fulfilled.  Very smooth animation and good music to match the feel of the show.  The one area where the 2005 series pales in comparison to the OVA series is the level of violence.  There are a few episodes where you see some twisted action, but all in all, it's not as intense or brutal.

For me, the trade off of more story in exchange for the violence is one I can appreciate.  I would have liked it if this show had some more skull crushing action, but I'd take a completed story arc over that any day of the week.",1424649600,4,793,4.1103896103896105

I was totally rocked by this series. There are tons of cool fight scenes. Lots of good villains and heroes. The voice acting is good and the animation is also pretty good. There is really good character development and some emotional scenes. This series also has lots of action to keep you interested.

I can't think of anything bad to say about Guyver. It's one you can watch several times and not get bored. It's not exactly one of the better anime titles out there, but it's still a lot of fun. I recommend giving it a try. I hope you like it as much as I do.",1350172800,4,707,4.237037037037037

3563543,3,B001F2U6X8,"First, I'll say, I haven't finished this yet.  That being said, I don't have a real drive to burn through this like other great series out there like Full Metal Alchemist, Darker than Black, Samurai Champaloo, Cowboy Bebop, etc.  The Guyver I remember was a lot darker than this.  I'm not talking about colors.  This has been dumbed down quite a bit.  That's disappointing.  I should've caught a streaming episode or two first before adding to my collection.  Moving on...

This is another series that makes me wonder about the ""NEED"" for a lot of animation to be on blu-ray.  This would have been just as ""good"" (loosely) on dvd (with or without an up-convertor).  There's just not enough detail to justify it.  Bright colors? Yes.  Sharp lines?  Yes.  Audio?  Ok.  But that makes it even worse.  Bright colors with the overall theme of Guyver is ""odd"" at best.  The characters are uninspiring and pretty bland.  The action is short and much to be desired.  I may finish this in 2012 just because I like the Guyver, but maybe not.  If you really want to see this, save a buck and get the dvd.  If you have a great connection, stream from one of the 1000s of  anime sites.  Don't waste on the blu-ray.  Not a must have on blu-ray.",1328745600,6,1230,4.4818181818181815

If you have seen any of the Orginal OVA's or even read the manga I think you will enjoy this remake. If you have not you will enjoy the Sci-fi and action.

3563545,5,B001F2U6X8,"Well folks,

There really is a red pill or blue issue going on with the older series as opposed to this bioboosted series.  You should ask yourself a few questions first;

1)  Am I turned off by the gore that has made asian film famous?
2)  Do I enjoy teenage romance?
3)  Have I recently fantasied about making out with a vampire?

If you answered yes to any of these then I would suggest the first series.  However, if the above made you laugh at my logic and snark you will enjoy the better drawn,well formed plot.  It also demonstrates much more violence than it's predecessor coupled with the class and elegance of the frequently used british or irish accent.  If you are still unsure which is the series for you, I suggest sampling them on youtube first.  See for yourself.",1304035200,6,779,4.453900709219858

Overall, it is a great revival of this classic series on BD. It is only sad that the US animes do not tell the full story as the rest was never published outside of Japan. It leaves thus some unsatisfying open threads that I would have hoped to see resolved in the story. But overall a good pick I can recommend to fans of this genre.",1298764800,,508,4.302083333333333

If this is your first serious anime series what im about to say may seem strange but this version is a bit less violent than the original! I wasn't all that happy about that but there's still more than enough blood and beat-downs to satisfy our basic needs for violence.

It's a good series and worth buying but you may want to check it out for yourself before you put it under the Christmas tree for your little ones.",1292457600,,567,4.390476190476191

He learns alot about life who he is how the world n people are n the dark side humans have for their greed n lust for power n the maddness they suffer when they are after power n control,Voices anime is perfect it runs well go together.this is a seris worth having its a classic and one worth adding to anyones collection.",1286064000,,787,3.925

There were to many questions and no answers.  On the new seriew all questions left by the OVA are answered and the art is fine by the new standards in anime and is brigther not so dark as in the OVA.

So if you have the oiriginal OVA and felt like me that the story was incomplete my suggestion is to get this series.  The art is good, the story is good, and the image is more brigth and clear, I have the DVD version not the Blu-ray version, so I beilive that there will be some improvements in the visuals.",1283817600,,647,3.9844961240310077

3563551,3,B001F2U6X8,"I am a fan of the original Guyver. I don't normally buy dvd's of anime that take 26 episodes to tell a story. This was a looong, drawn out, story that could have been told in much fewer episodes. I found myself walking away from the tv 1/2 way through the dvd's just because I was getting so bored with them introducing yet another monster, an evolved version of the same monster, and then the looong drawn out, missing time that Sho (Guyver) is ""evolving"" into a very effeminate version of the Guyver unit. (Spoiler) As the original Guyver, he had a cool, ""guy"" look but he evolves into a version that is way girly or effeminate which was a real step down in my opinion.
The animation is right up there with the original Guyver and current anime but the long, drawn out story and aweful evolution of the Guyver made me have to drop my review.
This is only for the true anime fans that enjoy the trend of making guys out to be girly looking and trying to still make them cool. The new Guyver is not the same Guyver you knew from the original. It is a step (or leap) down. He was cool the way he was. Look for previews before buying.
EDIT:
I showed this to a friend that is a huge anime fan and he said the same thing. ""Why does the Guyver look so gay by the end?""",1281484800,2,1263,4.138211382113822
