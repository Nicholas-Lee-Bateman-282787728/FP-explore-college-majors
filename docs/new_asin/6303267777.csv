Eric Kane is the most iconic character from All My Children. So it's the perfect gift for any soap opera fanatic. I'm taking a star off because the tape it's self is pretty dusty. It was wrapped in plastic, so I don't think it affected the tape itself. But it kind of hurt the presentation, since it was a gift.",1507852800,,447,4.033707865168539
7844012,5,6303267777,"All of those fans of 'Erica Kane' will NOT be disappointed with this video tape! As has been previously mentioned in the other post...it shows all the 'great' loves of Erica.

I especially loved the many scenes of Erica with Tom...their wedding & honeymoon they spent in St. Croix.

It was also so nice to see Erica with Mike Roy...the man that she truly loved and lost as he died in her arms.

If you love Erica Kane---this video is a must have!
