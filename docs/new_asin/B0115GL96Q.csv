7324847,5,B0115GL96Q,"This is all Brian's new 2015 No Pier Pressure album mostly performed live with all the people who sang on the album plus some oldies performed live. This was most of the NPP album, but the few not performed live are still on this DVD shown as they recorded those in the studio. It's worth getting,",1443916800,12,297,4.321428571428571
7324861,5,B0115GL96Q,I was a little hesitant when I bought this Blu-ray. But Brian Wilson definitely pulled it off. The band that accompanies him is top notch. They faithfully re-create the Beach  boys and Brian Wilson's solo pieces as well. Video and sound are excellent. Highly recommended,1486598400,5,270,5.0

7324903,3,B0115GL96Q,"The Blu-ray release does NOT come with bonus tracks, and the Blu-ray release does NOT come with CD.",1470700800,2,99,4.555555555555555
7324904,5,B0115GL96Q,"This is a confusing package and Amazon's Product description doesn't help. The DVD/CD version has the full concert plus the bonus tracks and interviews. The Bluray version does not have a CD. It's one disc.

Also, note that She & Him (Zooey Deschanel and M Ward) were not at the concert and they are inserted recording in the studio. (This was a promo concert for ""No Pier Pressure: And Kacy Musgraves is interviewed in the closing credit of the BD and chats about working with Brian in the Bonus Features but she does NOT perform at all on the DVD or BD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8723626,5,B0115GL96Q,this is an awesome cd.,1530835200,,22,3.6
8723632,5,B0115GL96Q,"I rarely listen to albums recorded live, but I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys music. The genius of Brian Wilson, ably accompanied by another original Beach Boy, Al Jardine, and a great bunch of musicians and vocalists. They include Paul Van Mertens, Matt Jardine, Darrien Sanjanaha and the incomparable Blondie Chaplin . You can just sit and listen to this on a continuous loop and find something new and exciting you didn't hear before.",1515542400,2,448,4.907894736842105

8723635,2,B0115GL96Q,"A concert should never be interrupted by interviews and studio recordings. This concert is, however, interrupted many times. Also, I can hear a lot of autotune and that is sad.",1498003200,,176,4.9
