421178,1,630200098X,"This is yet another failed attempt to transform a comic book into live action fare.  It fails miserably, as does almost every comic book adaptation attempt (even Batman missed the mark).  In this case, this movie  suffers from severe plot holes, annoying and often painful bad acting, and  cliches that make you cringe (why is it women heroes must fight women  villains?).  The only thing this movie has going for it is Jerry  Goldsmith's excellent music and an absolutely stunning wire-work flying  sequence, which, of course, lasts barely 90 seconds, and the film continues  back on its downward spiral.  The most unfortunate aspect of this whole  movie is that it actually had the basic elements to be something very good.  With an intelligent script and some ample money, a good movie could have  been made.  Unfortunately, it winds up being a fairly painful movie to  watch as you bang your head asking why someone wasted an opportunity to  make something good.  Buy the movie not because it's good, but to see how  not to make a movie.  The elements were there to make it good, they just  weren't executed.  What a shame.",914630400,4,1127,4.765625

Of course it doesn't compare to the TV series that is now on but I will say that Helen Slater was very good and I thought the plot was pretty good as well as the other actors and actresses.  It's a bit ""campy"" but if you like SuperGirl then it's worth having this movie in your collection.  I love Helen Slater in the current TV series as the mother of Kara/SuperGirl and Alex and wish they would show more of her in the series (i.e. she could be part of the DEO medical team).

421198,4,630200098X,"This film has all of the elements of a cheesy, low-budget 80s movie - bad effects, rainbow light-shows, and a somewhat confusing script. Comic book fans will also notice the significant deviation from Supergirl's origin story. That said, this movie is a pretty good watch. Female-centric superhero films are few and far between and although Helen Slater's girl of steel is a little giggly, she also saves the day (and keeps her clothes on). Her nemesis, played by Faye Dunaway, is two steps from vaudeville. Her over-the-top villainy carries an otherwise weak plot through to a conclusion. This film is by no means art, but it is fun, with a few laughs and a few good fight scenes. Better than Batman vs Superman.",1499558400,,713,4.804878048780488

Time to give us a remastered 4K scan Blu-ray edition.  There is a SuperGirl TV show now and it has made it to the second season.  There's more interest in seeing Helen Slater's SuperGirl as she also plays the Mom of SuperGirl in the TV show now.  So bring it out and people will buy it.

421325,3,630200098X,"Released in 1984, Supergirl stars Helen Slater as Supermans cousin, Kara-El, in a community of Krypton survivors who lose the mysterious orb that powers their city. Kara goes to earth to recover it, masquerading as a student at a girls school, where she meets Lois Lanes sister, Lucy (Maureen Teefy) and, later, Jimmy Olsen (Marc McClure). Peter O'Toole plays the leader of the Krypton city who is imprisoned in the Phantom Zone while Faye Dunaway plays a witch, Selena, who lives at an abandoned amusement park. When she obtains the orb she gains great diabolical power. Brenda Vaccaro and Peter Cook are on hand as her assistants while Hart Bochner plays the romantic interest of both Kara and Selena.

Remember how stunning the non-CGI props/sets/effects were in the opening Krypton sequence of 1978s Superman? They were so good they hold up to this day. Well, you can forget that with Supergirl. The opening sequences at Argo City are laughable by comparison. Furthermore, if you thought Gene Hackman was over-the-top as Lex Luthor, wait till you see Dunaways campy portrayal of Selena. But I don't mean any disrespect for Faye since thats how her character was written and she does an exuberant job.

In any case, if you can embrace these factors the movies surprisingly enjoyable, particularly the second act when Kara comes to earth, discovers her powers, and hooks up with the girls school. Slater had a winsome quality and, although physically beautiful, her costume wasn't made to over-emphasize it. Her beauty stems from within and the movie captures this. At the same time, the movie stresses her femininity and doesnt make her more masculine, like they did with Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (not that theres anything wrong with Linda in that film).

The film runs 124 minutes and was shot in Chicago, Manhattan and England.

I look forward to her cameo in the new CBS series this fall as she has aged really well based on her appearance on the series finale of Mad Men.

I never saw it when it first came out. Wish I hadn't wasted the rental fee. This movie made so little sense and, honestly, was just dumb. The only good thing about it was Helen Slater. Supergirl's world is going to die within days, if not hours, if she doesn't find the lost power source, and she treats it like a field trip. She's kissing boys and playing field hockey when she should be getting in touch with her cousin Superman to help her out (and seriously, he always knows when people are in danger, why doesn't he show up? I realize Christopher Reeves didn't want to play Superman anymore, but couldn't they have gotten somebody? This woman Selena is taking over the earth and he doesn't show up?). It was just painful to watch. There are just too many negatives to list, and not any positives.

421597,2,630200098X,"Helen Slater is an exceptional actress (but not the pretty waif needed for the role), and surrounded by what amounts to an all star supporting cast.  Given this, and given the amount of money that went into the creation of this film, one is given to wonder why it's such a mixed bag, and why women seem to like it but your traditional male movie fan, who likes female superheros and everything that goes with them, disliked this film.  I'll list some shortcomings.

1) Jeannot Szwarc; he's a decent enough director, and is noted for films that have a more feminine side to them (which is no doubt why he was picked to helm this project), but he doesn't know the ""hero"", much less ""superhero"", genre.

2) in the mythology that DC comics has created, Supergirl's home, Argo City, is from the same planet as Superman, Krypton, and was flung into space as the planet exploded.  This is never explained, and therefore it's never clear how how and why Slater's character is related to Chris Reeve's character from the earlier films, nor where the movie Argo City is from nor where it actually is (much less how it escaped Krypton's destruction, a much needed facet for this movie).

3) the ""Omegahedron"" is never full explained, and, worse yet, is a two bit glass prop, and, worse yet, is connected to a spinning thing that's obviously cradled between the actors' fingers as they hold it, and, worse yet, when Faye Dunaway's character picks it up she just somehow automatically knows how to tap into its power.

4) with the exception of Dunaway's character the rest of the characters in this film are very one dimensional.  Even the two villainous truck drivers twenty-five minutes into the film are stiff for would be redneck-cum-rapists.  They're also some of the dumbest characters ever, and and when they get beat up the whole affair is laughably comical due to the wire-work used to accentuate the force of Supergirl's blows.

5) Dunaway and Brenda Vaccaro's characters are supposed to be witches on the down and out, and there's an implication of a lesbian relationship, but, this being a Superman film (so to speak, even though its his female cousin who's the star) this aspect is kept so G-rated that we really don't understand why one is with the other.

6) Immediately Fay Dunaway's character goes after ""world domination"" without first getting herself out of her own financial doldrums.  One would think that getting a little spending cash would be the first thing on her mind given her financial straights.  But she doesn't so much as knock over a 7-11 with her magical trinket.

7) the film would have benefitted if it had been shot in the US on location, rather than on London backlots at Elstree, using an Anglophile American cast.

8) The original Supergirl (in the comic at the time), was your typical teenage girl.  She had an interest in school, boys, and even popularity.  Slater's character, however, is almost paladin-like in her resolve to go after the omegaherdron.  And where she's appropriately sensitive, caring and strong, she is more or less a caricature, that verse Chris Reeve's multidimensional Superman character who is a fully realized male with all the flaws of being a young man coming of age.

9) the male lead, according the girls of the time, wasn't the cross cultural heart throb of America, but played to more of New England or even New York female dem.  A young 20-something Cary Grant (if one existed) was needed for the role.

10) the overall script not only departed from the traditional superman mythos regarding his female cousin, but fails to bring to life small town USA or even college town USA where Kara El spends her time.  The humor is flat, contrived, and overall unfunny.  That's on top of giving us a very contrived and unbelievable plot (no doubt ""magic"" and ""witchcraft"" were what the marketers discovered that the female demographic for this thing believed would make a good antagonist for Supergirl).

11) finally, normally I'm very much against age discrimination, but the female leads needed to be at least five to seven years younger.

The one really good thing about this film, other than the fact that it actually is well put together, is that the score by Jerry Goldsmith truly is outstanding.  And the actors' performances, for what they are, are actually pretty good if somewhat stilted and marginally telegraphed.  The film looks professional enough, and is technically competent for the time (the effects were on par for the original Superman films as well as Star Wars, if somewhat dated by today's standards), but the story, lack of knowledge of the Supergirl character by both script and director, give us a film that's truly wanting to be more but fails.

Things that could have been done; explain Argo city, explain Kara's relationship via her parents blood relations with Brando's character from the other films, explain what the Omga-thing actually is, how it works, and how Dunaway's character could tap into its ""power"" so-to-speak.  Make Kara a teenage girl or a girl who has like interests as other girls, and give her some personality.  But, this is all Monday morning quarterbacking.  The only way to really judge a film is to watch it yourself.

It could have been a really good film, but wound up being a sappy wannabe young female fantasy instead of the good film that it could have been.  Ergo, as another reviewer put it, ""You will believe a film can suck.""  That may sound overly harsh, but when this film was made it needed to get men in the seats with their dates.  It needed to be a film for both men and women, boys and girls, and not a feminine version of a Superman film, because it even fails on this account.

And no, the two-disc special edition with both the Directors and International Cut does not help things.  A lacking story, flat leads, lack of vision brings you the film that this is.

Ergo, I don't recommend it.  Watch it if you must, but don't say I didn't warn you.

p.s. not to put too fine a point on it, but Linda Lee's roommate is reading a Hulk comic book 28 minutes into the film, published by Marvel Comics, not DC (Detective Comics).",1431216000,,6146,4.723523898781631

After accidentally losing the Omegahedron, Argo Citys power source, Kara Zor-El (Helen Slater) embarks on a journey to go recover it before Argo City perishes. Upon arriving on Earth, she discovers she has superpowers and adopts the identity of Supergirl, which she uses to help others while on her quest to recover the Omegahedron.

Elsewhere, the Omegahedron has fallen into the hands of Selena (Faye Dunaway), a flunky witch who quickly becomes powerful because of it and who sets her sights on Supergirl, ready to eliminate the Girl of Steel the first chance she can get.

Can Supergirl recover the Omegahedron before Argo City goes dark and Selena is victorious?

Its superheroine versus supervillainness in this 80s classic of Good vs Evil.

This flick is every bit a part of my childhood as the Superman movies were. At the time, of course, I was too young to understand the story, but now older, its not too bad. Sure, it has some flaws and continuity issues, but at its heart its the story about someone trying to right a grievous mistake, something that most of us can relate to.

The visuals and hints of Kryptonian mythology put forth quickly link it to the Superman moviesSupergirl identifies herself as Supermans cousin while in costume, and also as Clark Kents cousin when shes in disguise as Linda Lee; her supersuit is basically the Christopher Reeve costume from the waist upand it has a cinematic score that carries a similar heroic tone to that of its male counterpart. Likewise, Marc McClure reprises his role as Jimmy Olsen from the Superman movies and appears as Lucy Lanes boyfriend (Lucy is Lois Lanes younger sister).

They seem to want to jump right into Kara being Supergirl so don't give an explanation as to why she leaves Argo City in that bubble ship in one outfit then transforms inside the ship and flies out of the water in her supersuit, but whatever. They do a good job of showing her discovering her powers, the joy of having them, and also the satisfaction of using them for good.

As hopeful and cheery as this flick is at times, its also equally dark thanks to Selena being a witch. There is a ton of occult imagery and when you're watching this stuff as a kid, it creeps you right out. And that funhouse that Supergirls man in distress has to find his way out of? Shivers, man. But who isn't afraid of creepy funhouses, right?

The pacing was pretty decent and each obstacle Supergirl must overcome as the movie rolls along keeps getting bigger and bigger until the end when it seems all hope is lost and even the Girl of Steel is helpless.

What was especially cool is during the time of Supergirls tenure on Earth, Superman was elsewhere in the galaxy doing his thing, so when the story wraps up, Supergirl asks those who knew of her presence to forget she was there and flies off triumphant back to Argo City. This, of course, kept the two super franchises separate while still linking them. I heard Christopher Reeve was supposed to have a cameo in Supergirl but it didn't work out, with Reeve citing personal reasons (whatever those mightve been). Wouldve been amazing had the two teamed up for it. Maybe well finally get to see Supergirl and Superman together in Man of Steel 2 . . .

In the end, Supergirl is an overall enjoyable flick that is from a time before superhero movies got all dark and gritty, the hero was filled with angst and turmoil, and it enjoys itself for what it is: a movie about a girl who can fly.",1426896000,,3482,4.5909822866344605

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

Right off the bat I have to wonder about Supergirl's outfit.  I mean I know that her costume is based on Superman's, but that's the thing, she's never seen his costume before.  So how would she know what it looks like in order to make hers similar to his costume?  I guess it's just a minor complaint and I can overlook it.  Speaking of clothes, does Supergirl have clothes changing powers?  In every other scene she's changing her clothes just by flying or walking behind something.  I have to admit that she's never done that in any comic I've ever read.

When she gets to Earth, it looks like she is flying in front of stock footage from the archives of National Geographic.  It's really bad, and you can tell that it's fake right away.

Another thing I wonder about, why does Selena need this orb thing anyway?  I'm serious, she seems to have all her magic powers without even using the thing.  I admit it does seem like it LOOKS cool and powerful, but she seems to already be powerful without it.  I don't know, maybe it's an ego thing.

Moving along, after she gets out of the Phantom Zone and the floor is collapsing under her feet, why doesn't she just fly up into the air?  Did she forget she could fly?  Well eventually she does defeat Selena and she frees her friends.  And she asks them to not tell anyone she was here.  Why!?!  She doesn't have any enemies on Earth no one knows who she is, and no one can hurt them because they know her.  Also Lucy tells her that she'll tell everyone that Linda had to go.  But again I ask, Why!?!  No one knew who she was anyways!  Who is going to miss her?

And finally I have to ask, why does Selena want this Ethan guy so bad anyway?  I mean he's just one guy and he's not even that good looking.  Plus when she finally does get him under her spell, she doesn't even seem to want him there.  She smacks him around, orders him about and doesn't even really look at him.  So why did she want him in the first place?  Did she just want him because Supergirl had him?  I'm guessing that's probably why.

Zaltar (Peter O'Toole) with his twirling orange magic wand is creating and decorating Argo City, an isolated Kryptonian community. Kara, a teenage girl, is full of wonder and likes to learn from Zaltar. Zaltar shows her how he made a tree, but using his secret, a spinning hand-held ball, called the Omegahedron, gives him more power than ever before. He would like to leave Argo City and visit Saturn or Earth.  With the ball, he can make the tree more beautiful.
  Suddenly, Kara's mother, Alura (Mia Farrow) shows up. Zaltar stops the glow of the tree and quickly gives Kara the magic wand.  As Alura speaks with Zaltar, Kara draws a dragonfly with the magic wand. Zaltar secretly foots her the Omegahedron, so that Alura doesn't see it.  She uses the Omegahedron and the dragonfly comes to life. The dragonfly flies around and then busts a hole through the window going into space along with the Omegahedron. This briefly puts Argo City in danger, but Zaltar seals the window.  He is very disappointed the Omegahedron is gone.
  Kara secretly gets into Zaltar's spaceship and takes off.  She is transformed into Supergirl.
  She makes it to Earth, where eventually she will have to conquer the villainess, Selena (Faye Dunaway), to get the Omegahedron back.
  Supergirl is Superman's cousin.

421738,3,630200098X,"Not quite as bad as a lot of other reviewers have said... But it's still pretty ridiculous. It needed a much more extensive rewrite to be viable. Helen Slater is not bad in her role, and Faye Dunaway is giving her all as the villain. But there are just so many plotholes in this story that I'm surprised it didn't get sucked into the Phantom Zone itself.",1410048000,,354,4.298507462686567
421739,3,630200098X,"I didn't relize how bad this was, but thanks to Helen Slater for being easy on the eye's that alone is good enough to give it a Like!",1409616000,,133,3.7857142857142856

421741,5,630200098X,"SuperGirl sexy Helen Slater is amazing in this movie and quite frankly a reason worth owning it, she plays the hot cousin of Superman who has to go to earth to find an artefact that will save her world but it falls into the wrong hands as usual, the story has a bit of a weak set up at the beginning but is pretty good fun as the story goes on, its all set around the same timeline of Superman but he's apparently off on another planet helping them at the time, the effects are cool and good budget for the 80's and the soundtrack of course is good, there's plenty of corny action and cheesy lines etc but its all good fun, Helen Slater is a beautiful SuperGirl and looks amazing in her tight red and blue outfit, certainly worth going back too and picking up cheap if you don't have it already!! Be nice to see this on Blu-ray somebody??",1409184000,,838,4.179012345679013
421742,5,630200098X,"This version is different than the cable version because alot of scenes are longer and tells you alittle more about the movie so you understand it better. Like the scene when supergirl ends up in the phantom zone. The scene with peter o'tool ans helen slater talking in some room while in the phantom zone showed how zaltar kept busy by creating a hoarse sculpture and supergirl convinced try to escape even though there was a chance of failing. I think this was the best scene.working together against all odds. Sorry to ramble on,but finally I would like to say is I love the widescreen format and it looked like it was wider than the movie and I just loved it. I wished they made more. I think I was the only one in my family that really liked this movie.",1408838400,2,758,4.382978723404255

421781,4,630200098X,"Helen Slater is wonderful. Faye Dunaway a campy nightmare matched by Brenda Vaccaro  every step of the way. Hart Bochner, Peter Otoole, such a great cast. The movie itself is cheesy, silly fun, rife with bad dialogue and some questionable fx. All in all a good time. Just wish I could get ut on Blu Ray. Sigh.",1402272000,,309,4.421052631578948

421783,5,630200098X,Did supergirl meet my expectations. It greatly did and much much more. I am do happy with the movie and most importantly to me the package was in extra mint condition which was was outstanding for a used DVD.,1401235200,,208,4.358974358974359
421814,5,630200098X,"Helen Slater did an awesome job of acting her part. Great action. Great costume work, ok special effects. Super price for a Super movie. Go and buy  this movie.",1399766400,,160,4.517241379310345
421815,1,630200098X,This movie is weird and not nearly as good as the original superman.  It just drags on and the story doesn't even really make sense.,1397606400,,132,4.28
421816,3,630200098X,"Helen Slater makes a fine SUPERGIRL, who is innocent, courageous and easy on the eyes, but the choice to make this a hocus pocus fantasy and poke fun at the whole comic book concept instead of embracing-yet-respecting it, as SUPERMAN the Movie did, really undermines things. Faye Dunaway & Peter O'Toole are both fine actors with many acclaimed roles under their belts. Here however, they appear totally miss-cast and just overact and mug for the camera for most of the picture. Some of the action set-pieces are impressive and inspiring, but the film just seems like one long misfire. By this point it was painfully easy to see that the producers didn't give a crap about the character(s) and that they were just in it to keep milking the cash cow as long as possible and for every cent they could. Still the film makes for a fun, harmless time-waster on a rainy weekend. And as I mentioned earlier, Helen Slater sure is easy on the eyes! *SIGH* ;-)

The film is the longer European cut with about 10 extra minutes or so of footage edited back in. It looks very nice and the audio (and score) sound really strong and clean. Director Jeannot Szwarc did an OK job directing JAWS II, and a lot of women (and men) around the world simply adore his Richard Matheson-based love story SOMEWHERE IN TIME. Here however, he doesn't seem to ever get his feet firmly planted under him. He keeps trying to find a single focus, but keeps wondering from one style and to another. He does have some interesting comments to make in the commentary track, which also includes insights from Superman historian Scott Bosco as well. SUPERGIRL is an okay movie. It's not awful but it's not great, either. Certainly not on the same level as the original SUPERMAN. It's fun but not something that's a must-see or must-own, unless you're a collector of all things Superman. I got mine used, for cheap, so I feel it was worth the money. I probably would not have bought it if I'd have to pay full retail.",1395446400,6,1978,4.571830985915493
421817,1,630200098X,"A High School drama class could have done better.  Poorly edited, very sub-par special effects .. even for the time period, and cheesy acting/writing.  This is one that is not worth your time ... unless you've just finished driving a spike through your head.  I couldn't believe this was rated with more than one star.  To be honest ... this is just an insanely stupid movie ... but hey ... I sometimes like insanely stupid movies (e.g., The Holey Grail, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, etc.) ... just not this one.",1393459200,3,514,4.615384615384615

421819,5,630200098X,"This is back when they knew how to package a DVD. First you get the theatrical and the extended release of the film, but on two separate discs the way they should be. Each disc has its own original artwork not just a plain Jane disc. There is a really nice booklet (remember those when studios cared) it has original promotional newspaper items and games inside. As well as the original poster. It comes in the greatest double disc case that segments the two discs into thee own section of the case. Which is the best way to protect multiple disc DVDs. It also thickens the package making it very viewable in your collection so it stands out and you can actually read it from afar. This is just back when they cared how to put together a numbered collectors DVD. It's a must buy just for that alone. Plus it allows you to see a movie that's almost twice as long as the one you remember.",1391126400,3,886,4.311377245508982

421821,4,630200098X,"Originally quite available for under $10 last year, maybe WB Video will make it a DVD-R item in their archive collection. For it to disappear entirely would be a shame. The 124 Min. version is quite watchable. It suffers from much the same basic problems as many of the other Superman movies. Strangely cheap-looking sets, an uneven storyline, bad acting. Yet,  a triumphant ending. I hate the sub-plot with the hunky gardener. Too ""girly"".  It's never explained that Kriptonians are vulnerable to magic, which is well-known to DC Comic readers. It's fun, campy, and Helen Slater plays her character with the same conviction of a young Christopher Reeve. Desperately needs to re-remade. I nominate Jessica Alba, as a blonde, naturally!",1388188800,,735,5.116666666666666
421822,2,630200098X,"Ah, the memories! Poorly cast Helen Slater, worst acting ever by Faye Dunaway (which worked for her for Mommie Dearest), no plot, creepily bad score and weirdo appearances by Mia Farrow and Peter O'Toole!",1387843200,,204,5.029411764705882

421849,5,630200098X,"I was 15 when this gem came out and i fell immediately for helen = supergirl.
 I really don't know if this movie was good or bad and i don't care that it had flaws.
 the only thing i care is when i saw this i fell in love with HELEN SLATER.
 I went to see this 5 times in a week back in 1984 and i was frustrated there was never a sequel made with helen.
 The movie as...a movie was hilarius and was good for superman geeks but surely it had a weak plot but as i said for me that wasn't count.
 what was count is that i could see again and again helen in this film so imgine my joy when i got this dvd in to my hands.
 I watched the extended cut 3 times in one night.
 IT WAS AMAZING.
 The music is superb and i own the vinyl and cd O.S.T
 My fav scene is when supergirl falls in love with that cute man and kisses him.
 u watch that scene = u fell in love with helen. PERIOD
 The music track of that scene is called LOVE'S FIRST KISS and it's my favorite.
 All in all a hilarius part innocent movie (due to helen's acting and looks).
 A B-Movie u would love for reasons like those i stated above.
 this dvd is the best there is for this movie and of course u must see the international cut....",1383782400,,1194,3.8008130081300813

421851,3,630200098X,"I remember watching this movie several times as a kid and was the hugest Superman fan back then, so of course anything related to it I had to watch as well.  I remember loving this back then. Rewatching it today brings back fond memories though the film itself is really probably a 2.5/5 on a 5 star scale. The acting is mostly bad and the story is somewhat confusing if not ridiculous. But hey, you'll have that in these superhero movies anyway. It has its fun moments and it definitely has moments to make fun of. I mostly bought this as a birthday present for my 4-yr-old girl and she loves it. So much so that she ended up dressing as Supergirl for Halloween this year. It's definitely an age thing. That being said, to this day I still find Faye Dunaway in this to be one foxy Supergirl.",1383436800,2,792,4.315436241610739

421883,3,630200098X,"I recommend it as ""Required Superhero movie"" watching. You've got to see the bad to Appreciate the good films that come out of the Superman lore. Where the film hits the mark is the overall look (costume wise)of the Supergirl character and the special effects, and action sequences especially Supergirl Flying; looks natural. But, Slater is wooden in the acting and the supporting cast members follow suit. The plot is thin; after a mishap, an ""Omegahedron"" is blown out into space, and recovered by wanna be witch (Faye Dunaway), who wants it to become an Empress on earth. Get this film if you like me are a Completist, like me.",1376870400,2,630,4.736363636363636

The best thing about Supergirl is that she is a partner for Superman and their relationship as family...This is movie is just bad without an obvious character who should be in the film.

Seriously they even throw in Jimmie Olsen and place Lois Lane's little sister in the film...but can't deliver us the Man of Steel? He's suppose to be off doing something on another planet? The whole time Supergirl(Linda Lee) identifies herself as Clark Kent's cousin. This film makes me ill...if you can't deliver the goods of goods of a Superman & Supergirl team up film...just don't make it until you can. They should have taken this movie and made it the plot for Superman 3, where Superman is the main character and Supergirl played a sidekick...SIGH***",1376784000,3,915,4.71875
421885,2,630200098X,"Although we never really find out what that mystical ball supergirl was after (which fell into the wrong hands) does, Its pretty safe to say it doesn't give any acting powers.  Although in the actors and actresses defence, theres hardly anything in the movie to act on. The main villainess bent on world domination spending the entire movie fighting for  a young man like a teenager, really?  Perhaps now they could redo this movie only adding a plot and actors.  It did have sex appeal though.",1375747200,2,494,4.709302325581396

421996,3,630200098X,"Supergirl is basically a poor movie. It does however have a shinning star in Helen Slater as Supergirl who even though overtly green at times manages to give the character not only an appealing presence, but a natural innocence. She overcomes the clumsy script and amplifies her alien persona. If your a comic book buff (especially of DC comics) you may have a natural inclination to want to like the film, but feelings can't save the awful reality of the movie. The shame is that they had a real Supergirl surrounded by a big mess. Childish antics which make you cringe even more than Superman's ""Otis"" abound. With a premise that has Supergirl traveling to Earth to re-obtain the Omegahedron that will save her city, can all be lost?

Coming off the ridiculousness of Superman III, I can only figure that the filmmakers thought audiences wanted more buffoonery. Or, they just sank into their own selfish indulgences which were not all bad. The gaudiness remains pervasive throughout though. Hart Bochner's contrived ""romance"" is embarrassing, especially the poetry scenes. The villains to me are all clownish to the point of distraction. Had Faye Dunaway played her evil witch straight, we may have had something. Mia Farrow is bland and Peter O'Tool turns in an ""oh well the planet will blow up"" delivery. We also never got any bullets bouncing off Supergirl which made me, well, mad. On the plus side the Phantom Zone is well done and Supergirls perils within it bring a needed darkness that plays nicely. The flying scenes are quite good for the era, and playing the THX remastered dvd in a blu ray player adds beauty. The only way to watch this film IS the THX version as the print is surprisingly good compared to the grainy ""directors cut"".

The ""limited edition"" dvd which contains the THX version (and directors cut)is pricey now being that ""only' 50,000 were made. You may get lucky on ebay as I did. The extras are well worth it for ""Superman family"" DC fans. The lengthy ""making of the film"" featurette is a great watch as Slaters evolution is discussed. Multiple trailers, storyboards, and a cautious directors commentary fill out the disc. Supergirl fails in most ways, but strangely triumphs in giving us a memorable film heroine embodied by Slater that succeeds in it's own right.

But with this release, with added footage, a lot more of the movie clicks.  I think the editing down of the original U.S. theatrical release really did a disservice to the film.  While not ""Gone with the Wind"", it's still a pretty good story.

You really have to appreciate the athleticism of the young Helen Slater in this movie.  Her aerial ballet sequence was nothing short of extraordinary.  Watch the movie and think about the demands placed on the actress, especially in the flying sequences.  Also, there is more nuance to her performance in this film than we saw in the original theatrical release.  Supergirl's learning the wonders of being an ordinary earth teenage girl add a dimension to this release that was missing in the U.S. theatrical release.

Add to that a stellar cast, a sense of humor without going for campy, and overall you have a decent tale.  It certainly has some flaws, but if you're willing to suspend disbelief, and bear in mind that these are 80's era special effects, you'll have an enjoyable time.

I've always liked the relatively early scene where Supergirl is exploring her new power of flight shortly after emerging into our world. She makes a graceful curve out of the sky to trace her fingers along the surface of a pond and then ascend again. It was a well conceived scene and well executed on the screen.

The star power was not sparred for her co-stars, who at the time were (and some still are) much better known actors than Helen. Faye Dunaway plays a fake psychic who stumbles upon Kryptonian technology which gives her immense (and seemingly) magical powers. Peter O'Toole is her Kryptonian mentor who risks everything to help Kara (Supergirl) eventually escape from the Phantom Zone.

The movie has a lot of charm, and from my perspective, succeeded to a large degree because Helen looked GREAT in the Supergirl suit! LOL

This movie can be had for bargain prices. It fits in well with the original series of four Superman films, and for those reasons I highly recommend it.",1344816000,,1267,4.592920353982301

422081,5,630200098X,"I'm disturbed by all the negative reviews of this movie. It is my personal opinion that most of the negative reviews are a result of people not familiar with the story of Supergirl from the old comic book series based from the 1950's.  Those with negative comments do not seem to understand that Supergirl was not intended to be a full-blown superhero matched to Superman.  Unlike Supergirl, Superman had time for training prior to his en-devours.  I watched a few reviews on YouTube, and I was stunned at some of the reasons why critics blasted this awesome movie.  They used excuses such as the plot (nothing wrong with the plot), the villain too verbal, just to name a few.  What a bunch of non-sense!  A movie with action and romance; what else can you ask for in a superhero movie?  And unlike the love scenes between Lois Lane and Superman, what young Kara experienced is nothing short of the real world lives of young teens all across the globe.  Prior to visiting earth, she lived a life of social order, purity, solitude, and grace.  It should come to no ones surprise that her reactions on earth with other people would leave her vulnerable.  Thus, the director of Supergirl was spot on with his direction of the film.

I watched Supergirl on VHS in the mid 1980's, and fell in love with it.  Helen Slater did a marvelous job portraying a very young teenager.  Having remembered my teenage years, I recall my first love, first kiss, and my first conflict.  Supergirl was portrayed as a teenager experiencing these events for the very first time; Her first kiss as Linda Lee, blue me away and left me in tears....yes, a grown man crying even today after 17 years from first viewing Supergirl.  Her first conflict with an evil witch hungry for global domination was not an easy task to deal with.  Thus, Supergirl was not over-powering as Superman.  Her inexperience's led to a near fatality as she was sent to the Phantom Zone by the evil witch Selena.  I did find it a little odd that Selena would somehow obtain knowledge of the Phantom Zone.  Even so, it still made for a very great story line.  What fun would it have been if a young inexperienced Supergirl comes to earth and wins a solid victory with ease?

Some are confused as to why Eathon lost interest in Linda at the end of the movie.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand this; the spell was broken after Selena was banished to the PhZ.  Not to mention that Eathon was probably much older than young Kara anyways; this of course doesn't mean that he wasn't attracted to her.  Helen Slater filled the outfit quite nicely.  In fact, I'd say her dazzling and graceful appearance is more appealing than some of the smut and trash we see these days.

Cat Woman was a disaster in my book.  Cat Woman portrayed too much femininity full of power, and there was just too much sex-appeal.  And it seems that most young girls these days are looking for the anti-type to Superman; they want someone who is almost indestructible, and not susceptible to vulnerabilities, but with a sleazy touch; short skirts, tight abdomen, and large breasts.  Helen Slater dazzled me without any of that; I'd choose her over any modern day woman.  Women these days have never been taught the idea of curiosity.  It isn't always an appealing thing to reveal every inch of your body to a man (or woman); this comes later.  I was impressed with Helen Slater in a DC comic book convention interview. She was asked if she would show her abdomen as the modern Supergirl photo's show, and her response was ""NO, I WOULD NEVER SHOW MY MID-DRIFT"".  We need more female actors like Helen Slater to be a positive roll model for young women; that's something quite lacking these days.  Women these days are becoming too sleazy, and quite frankly, worse than the men in the 1960's.

Lastly, the music for Supergirl to this very day, blows me away.  I had no idea that Jerry Goldsmith and his Orchestra composed and performed music from Star Trek the Motion Picture.  I actually purchased the Supergirl CD sound track, and it's very soothing.  My only concern is that the CD doesn't contain the sound-track of the fist love scene in the amusement park.  Other than that, what a superb sound track which complements the movie quite well; Jerry Goldsmith's musical arrangements added definition and energy, and complemented each scene to near perfection.  As stated, I really loved the romance theme music; very beautiful.

I give 5 stars to Supergirl Limited Edition.

The movie does feature Peter O'Toole, who does his best with the awful dialogue,and Helen Slater is definitely a good fit for Supergirl. Unfortunately, neither can save this movie from being the utter schlock that it is.

From the very beginning this movie lacks any sort of logic. Just to get started, here is the premise: Supergirl comes to earth in order to find her colony's only power source, a walnut-sized ball which she lost after playing with it near a window - feel free to soak that in for a minute. And even though her entire family will soon die without this power-source, she wastes her time enrolling in school and hanging out with Lois Lane's little sister. In addition to this, there are all sorts of inconsistencies throughout the movie. For example, Supergirl has no idea what a ""train"" is, yet she has no problem forging a recommendation letter from her cousin Clark Kent.

While watching this movie I couldn't stop asking, Why? Why? Why? ... Why was the evil Selena (Faye Dunaway) so focused on making a hunk fall in lover with her when her goal was supposedly to take over the world? Why did Supergirl hijack the space ship to Earth when Zaltar (Peter O'Toole) was clearly more competent at searching for the power-source? Why did Supergirl stay in math class when she knew the power-source was right outside the school? These are all issues which the script failed to address.

Supergirl manages to be the worst of the 70s/80s era superman franchise.

422121,4,630200098X,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

I like ""Supergirl.""  Starring Helen Slater, Faye Dunaway, Brenda Vaccaro, Peter Cook, and Peter O'Toole, it's actually a fairly entertaining movie.  Some of its most glaring shortcomings are some of the most obvious strengths of the early Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" movies(of which this is an indirect 1984 spinoff), but this movie is also able to stand on its own.

Opening on Argo City, the movie does a decent job of establishing a distinct look for a contained, peaceful world.  Helen Slater is a good Kara Zor-El.  The chemistry between Ms. Slater and Peter O'Toole powers the early scenes and sets up a vaguely interesting plot point.  Mr. O'Toole plays Zaltar, a scientist and philosopher who is the custodian of the Omegahedron, a pulsating source of power for the planet.  Even as a kid I knew that(SPOILER) the Omegahedron gets blown to Earth and Kara leaves to bring it back.  I cannot help but compare this movie, in some respects, to the original ""Superman"" film.  It actually begged comparison initially by usinng the famous John Williams ""Superman"" theme in U.S. movie trailers.  This movie uses its own theme, a serviceable would-be epic from composer Jerry Goldsmith.  Character differentiation between Kara and Supergirl is almost nonexistent, since the movie rushes to Supergirl and the audience is robbed of a satisfactory origin story we get in most comic book adaptations. Despite this, Helen Slater's performance itself stays consistently solid throughout the picture.  The movie has a strong villainess in Faye Dunaway's witch Selena.

Some storytelling cheapness blows the high-minded theme of saving a world down a notch.  The screenplay spends too much time on a romantic rivalry between Supergirl and Selena over a blue-collar worker named Ethan, played by Hart Bochner.  I'm not necessarily saying the filmmakers needed to completely omit the idea, but more screentime for Peter Cook or Peter O'Toole would not have hurt the movie.

""Supergirl"" also marks the first time the audience sees the inside of the Phantom Zone, a hellish land of exile previously only visualized as a floating mirror in the first and second ""Superman"" movies. Essentially a vast and dangerous black desert, the Phantom Zone sequence in this movie remains a durable high point.

I cannot give this movie an extremely low rating, frankly in part because the ""Superman"" movies it spun off from set such a high standard it would be arguably impossible to expect greatness from this film.  This is still a very good movie, and deserves appreciation on its own merits.",1307664000,4,2586,5.114285714285714

422123,3,630200098X,"Supergirl(1984) was a critical and commercial flop. Siskel and Ebert thought it was disappointing and one newspaper headline claimed that it was a ""turkey that would never fly""! Supergirl was Alexander and Ilya Salkinds' attempt at keeping the dying Superman film franchise alive. In the past few years, there has been two prequels to X-Men(2000). Everything from the plot holes to the campy humor to the cardboard characters to the disjointed story has been criticized. Tri-Star Pictures cut forty minutes of footage from the U.S. version of the film and they made the movie even more incoherent!
 Supergirl is not a total failure. Helen Slater looks sexy, photogenic and fit as Supergirl and she does a good job playing Kara and her alter egos Linda Lee and Supergirl. Faye Dunaway gives a sincere, over the top performance as Selena, a power hungry witch who wants to conquer the world. Jeannot Szwarc(Jaws 2, Bug, Santa Claus) did a sincere job directing the film. Jerry Goldsmith's epic, energetic, inspiring, light-hearted Supergirl music score is an underrated classic. With the exception of the climax, the film is very fast paced. Supergirl is a rare big budget action-adventure film that has females in the lead roles. Brenda Vaccaro does her best playing Selena's half-wit stooge.  Supergirl was released on DVD in 1999 by Anchor Bay Entertainment in a special, expensive 2 disc edition that's out of print. Warner Bros. re-released the film on DVD in 2006 as a tie-in product to Superman Returns(2006). If you can turn off your ego and film snobbery for 2 1/2 hours, you may enjoy Supergirl.",1305936000,,1603,5.0
422156,3,630200098X,This movie is about as corny as any 80's movie could be but I still liked it after all these years. It's not Helen Slater's fault that the script was bad as she had no say in it and special effects at the time were blah and the plot overall was retarded but there is something in the film that still makes it worth while. Maybe it just reminds me of the good ol 80's or maybe it is the superlicious Helen Slater.

422157,1,630200098X,"I bought this DVD just to complete my ""Superman"" collection, and to see if it was as bad as I remember it. It was. The cheapness of the production shows in the bad sets and costumes. The plot makes barely any sense at all. Supergirl comes to earth to find the lost ""omegahedron"" without which her home, Argo City, is doomed to perish within a few days. Then, for no reason - and with no explanation -whatsoever, she adopts a secret identity and enrolls at private girl's school. She is alternately smart and stupid. This alien vistor knows enough to type up a fake resume for herself, yet doesn't know how to put on a bra. Helen Slater looks great as Supergirl, but her acting talent is marginal, and she comes across as sweet but rather dumb. (In recent years, Helen has played Superman's mother, Lara, on the TV show ""Smallville."" If anything, she is more beautiful as an older woman, and has matured greatly as an actress.) Although only doing it for the money, Peter O'Toole is too talented to completely phone in his performance. Faye Dunaway seems to be warming up for her role in ""Mommy, Dearest"" and has a grand time chewing the scenery, but never does she come across as a true menace. On the commentary, it is rather hilarious how director Jennt Swarzac (who has also directed many episodes of ""Smallville"")keeps heaping praise on the film, and tries to blame its failure on poor marketing.",1300406400,9,1400,4.604

422159,4,630200098X,"I am a big fan of the Original Superman (Christopher Reeve). I can't say much for Part 2 and onward, but the original Superman has always been one of my favorites. I'd never seen SuperGirl before until today and it, in my opinion, wasn't as bad as some reviews I've heard. Is it Cheesy? Definitely. Extra Cheesy. But Superman had quite a bit of corny moments as well, but I love it just the same. I think overall SuperGirl is a fun movie. Definitely a bit dated, but it was released in 1984 so that's to be expected. There's only a couple of things that bother me that I've noticed a few other people pointed out as well.

1. Where did the SuperGirl outfit come from? She enters the pod wearing a flowing gown (and no other clothing is visible, yet she suddenly out of nowhere has the costume). In Superman it's pretty obvious he made his outfit from the blanket he had in his pod.

2. The OmegaHedron just happens to fall into the hands of a power hungry witch bent on world domination? Well, I can forgive that one because sometimes weird coincidences happen and maybe it was 'drawn' to her power-hungry-ness.

3. The romance between Evan and SuperGirl was underdeveloped and shallow. He only falls in love with her at first due to the spell Selena put on him (to fall in love with the first person he sees). Just seemed a bit empty as a romance, but meh, guess a lot of movies are like that. It's just hard to 'feel' for them when the relationship isn't developed.

But you know what? Despite some obvious flaws, I still liked it and was entertained. I think for an 80's Superhero flick it delivers. It's a tad cornier and less developed than Superman, but it's not horrible. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a cheesy 80's Superhero popcorn movie.

422195,5,630200098X,"From the documentary on Super girl that I saw on Superman/Batman Apoclypse movie it said that WB credits the movie failure to their making Super Girl too much like the 1950s version of the character and not modernizing her with the times by giving her more of a rebels edge to her and not being so sweet tempered. I personally like the way the actress represented the girl of steel. I also think that Kara knew Superman was Clark Kent because most comic versions of Super girl at that time had Argo city monitoring Superman activities on earth. As for Selena and the phantom zone black magic would be best guest.

 The story deals with Kara who follows the Omega Hebran to Earth which Selena and would be witch finds and taps into it power to become a sorcorress surpreme. Having come from a Heavenly utopia like Argo city it is natural for her character to see the good in people more than the bad and have a sunny peronality. She takes up the identity of Linda Lee (Clark Kent cousin) at a boarding school of trouble makers which like in the silver age comics uses her powers to help students in need. With Superman off world the character of Jimmy Olsen from Superman films of the time make a guest appearance as does Lois Lane's sister. I'm still unclear why Jimmy can't dye his hair red to match his comic book characters. Seems women always dye for their movie parts but men never do.  As super girl tries to find what she searches for she falls in love with the same Earth man that Selena wants for her own. There a power struggle as and Selena sends Super girl into a phantom zone more nightmarish than the one seen in Superman 2 movie.  She escapes; stops Selena and return home with her prize.

some people who see this movie might find it corny or campy (whatever the current term is) but one must remember that this is how silver age super heroes and heroines were like. I would take Helen Slater's super girl to the hot tempered ill manner one from Smallville TV series any time.  Seems like movies go out of their way these days to make the heroines fowl mouth, hot tempered brats while in real life I've known very few women who act like heroines of the modern cinema.",1285804800,2,2183,4.4044665012406945
422196,4,630200098X,"I have to admit, it is a little lame.

I watched it once as a kid, and finally watched it again last night. I aleady knew it was a mediocre story with painfully corny characters and dialog. But what really struck me this time was the sheer uselessness of Supergirl.

Time after time, in every Supergirl scene, she proved her worthlessness. A rampaging truck tears through a town? Only Supergirl can stop it! But lets sit around and watch it first. We've got to let it destroy half the town before we do anything, at least!

(Hmmm... Some fire about to blow up the gas station? Think, Supergirl! Think HARD! ""Uh, let's go destroy the town's water tower. That might help."" No, Supergirl, no. You have freezing breath, remember? Ah, forget it.)

Or an invisible monster comes toward her, destroying everything in its path. Would have been kind of nice if she had stopped it before it tore up the lawn too bad, you know? Instead, she stand and stares at it. She's good at that, if anything. Standing and staring. Of course I don't mind looking at her, but still...

And then there's the times when the ""cute dude"" gets kidnapped and abused - again and again... Seems like it would be a good time for Supergirl to do something about it, right? She seems strangely inept for the job. When she finally does rescue him - from some evil bumper cars, no less - He immediately gets assaulted by a coconut. She even sees it coming! But instead of using her super speed, or even telling the guy ""heads up!"", she opts for standing by helplessly. While the nut hits him on the head, splitting his skull open and leaving him to die a slow, painful, lingering death- (Oops! My bad. Just dreamin' for a moment there. That particular actor survives this movie, unfortunately. He doesn't die until Hans Gruber shoots him in the first Die Hard, for which I am grateful. Thank you, Hans!)

I think you get my point, but I've got to mention the whole ""walk into the enemy lair and get trapped in the phantom zone"" routine, as if she couldn't have seen that coming! (Okay, to be fair maybe she couldn't. But I'm on a roll here!) But the final point was when she was getting threatened by the floor collapsing beneath her. Uh, hello? You're Supergirl? You can FLY, remember? Fly girl, fly!

Oh well. It was still nice at the end, when she finished off the bad guy with- what? A whirlwind? I didn't quite get that. But whatever. All's well that ended well. And an enjoyable popcorn flick it was.

I know others have already mentioned it, but Helen Slater is super-hot, for sure. I liked watching her, even if the script she was given was painful at times. Also, Faye Dunaway made for a great villain. And she was pretty darn hot, too. I would have liked being her ""gardener boy"" anytime.

Watch for Helen Slater also in ""The Secret of My Success"", another good 80's flick.

P.S. I couldn't help but wince when Supergirl delivered a ""Super Kick"" to the one guy... Say it with me, folks: ""Ouch!""",1282521600,4,2967,4.477777777777778

422198,3,630200098X,"I rate this version 2 1/2 to 3 stars and the DVD even more so.
Jeannot Szwarc's 138 minute Director's Cut makes this fairly flawed film a little more palatable. The one thing that shines throughout most of this convoluted movie is Helen Slater. At the time she was only 19 years old and this was her first feature film.  Helen Slater's characterization of Linda Lee and Supergirl are nearly faultless and critics, no matter how they felt about the movie, picked up on it. Some critics even going so far as to say that Helen's characterization of meek, mild Linda Lee (Supergirl's earthly identity) was more convincing than Reeve's Clark Kent. Watch Helen's reactions to a budding flower, trees, water, horses, her ability to fly, the water splashing onto her face from her first shower. Kara has never experienced any of these things in Argo City and Helen carries it off with a complete sense of wonder, even when she experiences her first crush. Roger Ebert even said that Slater was the best thing in the film. If you can keep your focus on Slater's acting and Jerry Goldsmith's light and uplifting musical score, I think you can get through this relatively unscathed.  If you're still having difficulty, fortunately for you, this DVD set is loaded with Extras. The hour long ""The Making of Supergirl"" is a must see!  It shows how they found Helen, shows them filming many sequences (the flight ballet), it has interviews with many of the stars during the production and even shows Helen's rigorous training regimen.  Extras include several U.S. and Foreign theatrical trailers, TV spots, stills and posters, talent bios, the International cut of the film with optional audio commentary by the director and project consultant and a 16 page bonus booklet. Anchor Bay no longer produces this Limited Edition set (mine is numbered 25,599 of 50,000). If you can find it though, and you love the Maid of Might, then buy it.

422202,5,630200098X,"I don't remember when I first heard about this film.  But, it was at least at age five, a year after it was released to theaters.  Apparently, most people didn't think much of it, because it was viewed historically as a commercial flop.  A part of it may have been circumstantial, though.  Supergirl production was started hot off the heals of the rap on Superman III, a film that performed abominably in the theaters.  Pending who you asked, many people were starting to get burnt out on the Superman cannon, and they must've seen a teenage, female equivalent as a joke.  If it had been produced and released in between Superman II and III, that might've had a more positive, circumstantial effect.

Here, Helen Slater stars in her first leading role as Kara, the Kryptonian cousin to Superman (official name of Kal-El) who left Krypton with her parents to live in the inner-space settlement of Argo City.  At the film's start, her mentor Zaltar (Peter O'Toole), incidentally the city's forefather, makes a mistake that forces a key power source, an omegahendron) to disappear into outer space, necessitating Kara's swift departure to rescue it, Zaltar's lifelong expulsion into Phantom Zone and possibly resulting in the whole city's eventual degradation.  The omegahendron surfaces on earth and, the little ball is snared by a narcissistic, pretentious and vindictive would-be witch named Solina (Faye Dunaway) and her jittery sister, Bianca.

When Kara surfaces on earth herself, she discovers she has unprecedented powers of flight, strength, hearing and mater manipulation.  She uses an armband transmitter to detect the general location of the ball.  Eventually, she manages to disguise herself to conceal her attire.  Then, she passes as a student at a private university in a town called Midvale.  She passes as Clark Kent's cousin, Linda Lee and forges a letter of recommendation from him.  The headmaster places her with Lucy Lane, a sophomore who happens to be sister of Lois Lane and love interest of Jimmy Olsen (Marc McClure reprising his Superman role).  As a coincidence, their math teacher, a man named Nigel is also Solina's erstwhile instructor of black magic.  He pursues her repeatedly, and she repeatedly rebuffs him.

Meanwhile, all the girls at the school (including Linda) lust after a big, muscular groundskeeper named Ethan.  But, Bianca also catches his eye, as does Solina, who says he belongs to her.  Using a cheap form of black magic, she seduces him and tries to make him fall for her.  However, her magic goes badly awry, and his heart instead falls to Linda (after she changes to her true identity and saves him from physical danger).  Back in her dorm, Linda is forced to do battle with Solina's evil magic (as Kara) and comes out of this bout unscathed.  Then, she gets a signal from her transmitter that the omegahendron is functioning, and she tears off for the abandoned amusement park where the evil sisters reside.

And, who should be waiting for her but Ethan, spouting uncharacteristic love poetry and brandishing flowers & chocolates for Linda.  The two are ambushed by the sisters, and Solina attempts to eliminate Linda, unsuccessfully.  Linda is forced to change back into Kara and carry Ethan away to a distant lakeside.  Solina eventually caves in and asks Nigel to help her eliminate Kara (whom she appropriately christens ""Supergirl"").  Nigel arrives at the park with a wand built for pure evil, which they use to lure Ethan back; Solina steals the wand, petrifies Nigel and creates a tall mountain with a castle on top in the exact middle of town.  Supergirl arrives in the castle to rescue Ethan, only to find herself imprisoned in a diamond-shaped piece of glass, which then expels her to the Phantom Zone along with Zaltar.  Meanwhile, she succeeds in subduing the whole community and seizing Lucy & Jimmy.

at first, she doesn't know where she is, but she knows she's lost her powers.  When she and Zaltar come into contact with each other, Kara tries convincing him that they shouldn't let the Phantom Zone consume them and that if they don't try and escape, Argo City is finished and so is earth.  She uses straightforward teenage irony to finally win him over, and they push off for a deadly vortex.  If they can circumvent the perimeter of the vortex, they can get to a way out.  However, with the aide of her magic mirror, Solina spies on Kara & Zaltar and tries summoning elements of the Zone to kill them.  She succeeds in finishing Zaltar, who lets himself die so Kara can push through.  This she does, regaining her earthly abilities and flying straight through Solina's mirror and into the castle.  Supergirl manages to rescue Lucy, Jimmy & Nigel from the cages they've been sealed in and engages a battle with Solina's dark magic.  With help from Ethan and Nigel, Supergirl not only overpowers the magic but manages to create a vortex and shunt Solina & Bianca through the broken mirror and into the Phantom Zone.  Afterwards, things return to normal, and Kara is able to return to Argo City with the reclaimed omegahendron.

I for one thought the movie was well worth watching.  I've actually watched it multiple times.  It didn't include Christopher Reeve, Margot Kitter, Jackie Cooper or Gene Hackman, but that has very little to do with the quality of the film.  It's an almost-completely new cast, and that does in fact add to the unacknowledged greatness of the film.  It did go kind of far when the character of Ethan mentioned the fact that Supergirl [and Superman] could ""leap tall buildings in a single bound.""  But, that was probably the only remotely inappropriate Superman reference in the finished product.

There are only two real problems I've ever had with this film, and neither one of them could make me change my rating.  First, How does Kara find out that Superman's earth identity is Clark Kent?  Also, could someone explain to me where Solina could possibly have learned about the Phantom Zone, let alone send Supergirl there or manage to manipulate its elements?",1256860800,25,6055,4.88921568627451
422203,4,630200098X,"After the abysmal Superman III, I think the Salkinds were trying to redeem themselves by not making this spin-off a farce. With some top notch supporting actors surrounding Helen Slater (much like in Superman I with Reeve), it makes the movie more enjoyable. Slater's portrayal is spot-on for a stranger in a new world, still speaking in a Shakspearean tone. Dunaway makes for an interesting villain and sidekick Brenda Vaccaro has several funny moments, and both have tremendous chemistry. Peter O'Toole makes for an interesting Brando-esque character in this but doesn't make an impact in Supergirl's struggle until the end. Mia Farrow, though given very good billing, hardly qualifies as starring in it, more like a cameo (much like Helena Bonham Carter in Harry Potter V and Christopher Lee in The Golden Compass).I would've picked someone else to play Lucy Lane (though the actress does have a resemblance to Margot Kidder). As far as story goes, this is very original, especially having Supergirl go up against someone who uses magic (not as well known weakness against her and Superman) instead of just laying Kryptonite on her. And having the villain be in way over her head when she gets the Omegahedron is another twist instead of being a rich business man. The effects are on the level of Superman 3, being very good. The flying shots hardly look like they've been filmed in front of a screen and the wires are visible only in a few shots. Jerry Goldsmith (finally I get to praise someone else) provides an excellent score and gives Supergirl a theme almost as memorable as her cousin's.",1252886400,,1598,4.900369003690037

The story is basically about Supergirl going to Earth to reclaim something lost from her home planet, which ultimately lands in the hands of an amateur witch, Selena, who wants nothing less than world domination. The story holds together well enough to keep me from pressing fast forward. Slater as Supergil captures the wide eyed girl struggling with being a human and saving her alien race. I enjoyed the villains that emerged in this film. It was interesting to see magic take on the Girl of Steel, rather than kryptonite. And the sequence where the Shadow Monster hunts down the Girl of Steel and then fight her gave me chills. This movie makes a great addition to all Superman fans and collectors. It is also kid friendly and girl friendly. You don't always get a chance to see a female superhero in live action and one done with such class and grace.",1243728000,2,1004,4.646067415730337
422250,4,630200098X,"This movie has gotten so many seriously mixed reviews. I didn't get to see it when I was a kid and it was in theaters and just never got around to seeing it before now, but now that I have, I'm glad I did. I've been a long time fan of Supergirl. I still collect her comics.

This movie is not as bad as I thought it was going to be, but it does have some issues. They took a campy approach with the villain, played by Faye Dunaway, and no matter how hard I try, I just can't see anything but Mommy Dearest, Joan Crawford in her performance.

However, this IS based on a comic book, after all and we should remember that. Comics have all sorts of outrageous storylines. Why would we expect any less from a comic book based movie? Why do we expect comic based movies to be so different than what they're based on?

Helen Slater did a great job in my opinion. She captured Supergirl's innocence and immaturity and her serious, ""never smile"" mannerism. She looks like she stepped out of some of my comics.

I wish that somebody would bring Supergirl back to the movies, but this time, using modern CGI. So much of the issues with this movie have to do with the cheesy special effects. Though the flying scenes are fairly well done and Helen Slater managed to capture Supergirl's famous postures well, the rest of the spfx are really dated.

The costumes and wig work are very good. Slater looks like Linda from my Superman Family comics of the 1970's with her brown hairstyle, and Faye Dunaway has some fantastic costumes. I love the costume for Supergirl. It was very well done. Her hair was great, too.

All in all, this movie is much better than Superman 3 or 4 and this franchise has a lot of potential. I don't know why it wasn't done over in more recent years or why they didn't follow this one up with another.

No, its not perfect. Faye Dunaway's character could have been a bad guy on the cheesy Batman show of the 1960's, but unlike that show, where Batman and Robin were very campy themselves, Slater tried to more or less play it straight and I actually didn't find it that hard to accept her right from the time she got on Earth.

The only thing to admire is it was the first female superhero film. I see why it was cut down for U.S. release as was ""Superman IV:The Quest For Peace"". When it's this bad less is more. The international version was bad enough, but the director's cut further cheapens and worsens the film and fully shows the Salkinds lack of ability to properly and successfully produce a multi-million dollar production, beginning with a dreadful script and casting, and ending with ridiculous acting due to a director without vision of his own, much needed due to the fact that the Salkind and Spengler vision was a mess. They were full of themselves and I guess smoking their own press to think their dumb, cheap ideas would work. The millions spent could have elevated this to a good, if not great film had they known what they were doing. They saw what Richard Donner's approach brought(a critical and financial super success for ""Superman:The Movie"") but their ego's got in the way and they refused his approach, no matter how successful it proved to be. So they did it their way and look what we got: what Richard Lester directed in ""II"" and then ""III"" followed by this. Lame, lame, lame. What a missed opportunity. What a shame. Hopefully there will never be another Salkind production ever again. The special features on the Anchor Bay release an overblown, overlong vintage making of documentary shows the egos of the producers, they acted as if they were making ""Gone With The Wind"". Hopefully, this current WB release has no special features, the film is bad enough. WB released this film everywhere in the world but here, and saw it flop country to country, so they sold the releasing rights to Columbia's new sister company, Tri-Star Pictures looking to release a known commodity, but were not rewarded. Hopefully the producers of the upcoming ""Wonder Woman"" film will not repeat the mistake of this god awful mess of an excuse for a film.",1235865600,3,2888,4.789579158316633

422256,5,630200098X,"Supergirl has long been one of my favorite movies.  I'd catch it on TV when it was on and even recorded one version with my VCR.  But the one problem was that I was at the mercy of the TV channels, editing the movie as they saw fit.  Therefore, I'm glad that I bought this movie, the full 124-minute version, with all the scenes together, even ones that I don't think I had ever seen before.

The movie itself is great.  It's fast paced; it's inspirational, with a naive and scared teenager having to use her intelligence to save her people; it's got great acting, especially Faye Dunaway's inspired mad performance; and so forth.

The DVD contains the full version of the movie, as well as director's commentary--with director Jeannot Szwarc and historian Scott Bosco talking about the movie as it's playing.  It's an interesting take on it (particularly on the Phantom Zone scenes) and is obviously candid, since the director does embarrass himself a couple times.  Supposedly, there's also the theatrical trailer, which I'd love to see, but I can't access it with my DVD player (I'm sure it's just a problem with my DVD player and not with DVD itself).

Amazon does have an error, though.  Amazon claims this is rated PG; however, this version is unrated, because it's ten minutes longer than the PG-rated version.",1221782400,,1317,4.7368421052631575
422257,2,630200098X,"I hadn't seen this in 24 years. As a huge teenaged fan of the Superman family mythos, I was crushed by the poor quality of this film when it was released in 1984. Seeing all the glowing ""camp value"" reviews here I decided to give it another go - for laughs. But I couldn't get through the first half of it without wandering off to check the laundry. It wasn't funny. Just mind-numbingly nonsensical and dull, dull, dull.

The problem is not the effects. They're actually above average for an early 80s film. Nor is it the cast. They're all talented actors (some of them Oscar winners) and Helen Slater is very pretty and gives it her dead-level best in her first movie role. She was a fine choice to play Supergirl. She just did it in the wrong movie!

The problem is an abysmally ham-handed, out-of-left-field, emotionally flat script that makes no logical sense whatsoever. Even fantasy worlds have rules within themselves but the world of David O'Dell and Jeannot Szwarc's Supergirl has none. Zero. Zilch.",1218153600,4,1008,4.6892655367231635
422258,4,630200098X,"""You girls are rank amateurs playing with fire!""

""Because WE own the matches.""

Better than average flick that cashes in on a winning formula.  Faye Dunaway  as the villainess, lending a little star weight.  Keep your expectations way low and you'll probably enjoy much of it, in spite of yourself.  I haven't turned it off, and I will when movies bore me too much.  This one hasn't yet, though it is undeniably ridiculous.  NOTE: THIS IS MY REVIEW AFTER HALF AN HOUR.

""Oh terrific, the old dangling in a cage thing"".

Actually, it has the flavor of a cult B-movie at times.  There's something of the Rocky Horror Picture Show in Faye Dunaway's fiendish character - like where are the whips and chains?  Supergirl is probably one of the sexiest superheroes to come along, beautiful in her SuperGirl outfit with blond hair, less so as a brunette in her girl school uniform.  Besides being superequiped with all the powers that run in the SuperFamily, she's also quite the romantic.  THIS AFTER AN HOUR AND A HALF.

Actually, this movie gets better as it goes along and fully deserves cult status for it's combination of ridiculousness, dark B movie scenarios and a quirkiness that develops into all the classic proportions as the movie goes on.  The eighties was a good decade for that kind of thing I guess.  This movie has dark netherworlds, a black magic villain and a pretty superhero with a girlish charm.  What more could you ask for?  I can understand some people giving this five stars.  For the right audience, it could be.

p.s. - the cover of the US version takes itself too seriously I think.  My Japanese zone 2 version, as usual, has the essential cover art - in this case, the original movie poster (it's a drawing of Supergirl flying up into space with a demon behind her and a schoolgirl in uniform in the background - drawing style similar to original Star Wars poster).  I don't understand why dvd makers insist on updating and modernizing artwork for classic movies, or why they can't use images from the movie that have more sense of art, mystery, or general cleverness or humour in them - or original movie posters for some. I just bought Henry Winkler's ""The One and Only"" (1978) and they didn't bother to use the original art of the film (which had been used for the videotape) but instead opted for some cheesy modern photo that was supposed to encapsulate the feeling of the movie, but which totally didn't have and feeling of the times.  People often watch these movies to capture that retro flavor.  No one's hoping they're gonna come up to standards with the latest Hollywood blockbuster - so why all the boring cover art?",1216598400,2,2652,4.651612903225806

422271,3,630200098X,"This is an okay pass at a Supergirl movie. In an effort to set this one apart from the Superman series, the filmmakers tried to make this one more about a magical enemy, rather than the more Sci Fi aspect of the Superman movies. Magic had already been introduced into the comics as a force that could harm the Super clan, but it becomes a bit tricky to portray it on the big screen without losing your audience.

The villainess and her assistant have little charisma, which already places them below Lex Luthor in the minds of the audience. This is one of the large problems that plagued Superman III. Of course it doesn't help that the main thrust of Serlena's ""evil plan"" for most of the movie seems to revolve around getting a hunky construction worker to fall in love with her.

When the spell accidentally causes him to fall for Supergirl's human guise, Linda, Serlena decides to start the catfight to end all catfights. Or that's what it seems like. There's little sense that there is a real threat for Supergirl to fight except for the attacks  against herself. Superman and Supergirl work best when the fight they are in is for more than their own lives. We just don't get a sense that that is happening here.

Other than that, the effects are not terrible, but the fight at the end with the force of shadows is a bit obscurely filmed. It comes across as a bit confusing.

In truth, the world is actually in danger because Serlena has been using the Omegahedron to increase her powers exponentially, but it doesn't come across like that.

It's better than Superman IV (big deal) and it may be roughly on par with Superman III, but that can largely rely on your personal preferences in this matter.",1210032000,4,1705,4.537459283387622

Supergirl the movie is excellent, it is different from all superman movies, its more of a fantasy movie than a Sci fi one, i mean it has a fortress, magic, two worlds and classical good vs evil theme, i guess it is only missing some swords.
the plot involves Kara a young naieve girl from Argo city, she travels between the inner space world to our outer space world in search for the Omegahedron or something that is valiauble to her city, she arrives to earth and faces Selena who steals the Omegahedron to use for her own twisted evil plans.
the plot is fast paced, it moves quickly and doesn't seem to drag, although at times seemed rushed to the extent that they left some stuff unexplained ( hence minus a star ), but i like quick and direct scripts without dragging scenes.
Acting was excellent by all, i especially enjoyed Helen Slater as supergirl, she is hot to look at too in that sexy supergirl uniform and her well formed body !
Sepcial effects were also pretty good, its more than 20 years old and still stands strong among today's high tech movies.
I gave this movie 4 stars, minus one mainly because of some minor plot holes ( eg : supergirls knows what and how to use a type writer but doesn't know what a train is ), and as i mentioned before a rushed script, other than that this movie is pretty good and enjoyable..a truly magical fantasy world with supergirl in it !",1194739200,3,1534,4.348432055749129

Cheesy? YES. In fact, as were many superheroine portrayals in the 1980's, this would be one of the dingiest portrayals of a female superhero to date. And it's more of an attempted comedy than it was a superhero/action film. However, her interaction with the Superman poster, her rooming with Lois Lane's sister, the cameo appearance by Jimmy Olsen, and our first glance at the Phantom Zone make for a good addition to one's Superman collection. In fact, as cheesy as the movie was, the things that urked me more than the comic approach and stiff dialogue were: (1)how did the Kryptonian module find it's way into the lake, (2)where did the Supergirl outfit come from, and (3)how she was a brunette as Linda Lee and a blonde as Supergirl?

422300,4,630200098X,"This movie doesn't get the credit it deserves, it does have it's few dull moments, but it is overall a really good movie. Helen Slater excels in her role as Kara, the cousin of Kal-El (Superman). It stays loyal to the basic storyline of Supergirl, but doesn't explain enough for those who don't know Supergirl's backstory. Fans of the movie wonder how Kryptonians are still alive after the planet blew up, the movie doesn't tell you of how her city was blown off with a chunk of the planet that wasn't destroyed. That isn't told in the movie, so I can see where some would be scratching their heads.

The special effects are done very well, and the entire scene of the movie when Kara first lands on Earth is well done. From the beginning when she comes out of the lake to when she is flying over the horses and cities, it is a beautiful sight to see. I think that the highlight fight scene of the movie is when Supergirl fights the invisible dragon, and also the fight scene at the carnival with Selena.

Faye Dunaway does a fair job as the villainess Selena, a witch who has world domination on her mind. She is annoying at times, but gets less annoying as the movie progresses. Marc Maclure returns Jimmy Olsen for a little bit in the movie, which is a nice touch to see from the Superman films. The best words to describe this movie is that at least it's better than Superman IV: Quest for Peace. No question about it",1190073600,3,1421,4.378787878787879
422301,5,630200098X,"Although Superman was long thought to be the only survivor of his doomed home world of Krypton many Kryptonians were able to survive its explosion and survive in 'inner-space.' Their survival was made possible due to a device known as the Omegahedron, which provides their city with energy to power their devices, and air to breathe, among other things.  Argo City has blossomed into a utopian society where its inhabitants have become complacent. Zaltar, the city's founder and resident artist, expresses his desire to leave Argo City for parts unknown; however his plans are not to be. Having 'borrowed' the Omegahedron to bring his tree sculpture to life  Zaltar attempts to hide his theft from Allura, Kara's mother, by secretly slipping the Omegahedron to Kara while discussing his plans for leaving inner space. Kara subsequently uses the Omegahedron on her own creation, an insect-like creature, that tears through one of the city's walls.

When the precious Omegahedron is sucked into space all hope seems lost, but Kara is determined to return it before the lights, and lives, of Argo City are extinguished forever. Kara follows the Omegahedron to Earth and, discovering her powers, becomes Supergirl.

Guided by a bracelet whose gem is linked to the Omegahedron, Supergirl follows the signal to Midvale, Illinois and assuming the alter ego of Linda Lee enrolls in an all girl college to provide herself with a cover story for her time on Earth. Meanwhile, the Omegahedron finds its way into the hands of a 'wicked sorceress' named Selena who harnesses its power to amplify her black magic. After experimenting on a chicken with her new found powers, Selena sets her eyes on winning the affections of Ethan, a handsome, if aloof, gardener.  Selena's ambitions then reach new heights and she declares her desire to rule the world.

Supergirl struggles to acclimate to Earth culture, as she fights mundane forces in the form of Myra and Muffy, two female bullies at her school; and magical ones in the form of the dark forces Selena repeatedly sends in an attempt to destroy her. Failing in her attempts to destroy Supergirl and claim Ethan as her consort, Selena enlists the help of her erstwhile mentor, Nigel, into helping her fully control the Omegahedron and, upon success, abruptly turns on him in true villainous fashion. Now, having mastered the powers of the Omegahedron, Selena successfully sends Supergirl to the Phantom Zone, where she is powerless, and promptly turns Midvale into a police state.  Here, Supergirl is reunited with Zaltar who has been imprisoned for losing the Omegahedron. Zaltar ultimately sacrifices himself in order to lead Supergirl out of the Phantom Zone and back to Earth where she engages Selena in an all out battle of might versus magic for possession of the ultimate power.

Considered a major failure for many years, Supergirl attempted to do what didn't occur until the release of Superman Returns in 2006, which was to revive a dying franchise. Critics panned the film for its camp, bad acting, poor use of actors, and sub par script. However, the popularity of Supergirl has grown over the years into a cult classic on par with The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Harold and Maude, and Reefer Madness to name a few.

Although there are plot holes, there are not as many as have been claimed. One such plot hole which is often brought up is the question of where Supergirl gets her costume upon emerging from the lake following the Omegahedron. This question can be easily answered if you look closely when Kara enters the sphere which transports her to Earth you can clearly see that she sits on a clear package about the size of a throw pillow containing a suit in the familiar yellow, red, and blue. Other plot-holes such as the question regarding how Selena had knowledge of the Phantom Zone aren't so easily answered.

Despite its plot holes and occasional over-acting, Supergirl is not without merit. The 'flying ballet' sequence, as it has been called, captures the beauty and joy of a nave young girl coming into her own power. The musical score brings an added dimension to the actions occurring in the film. Blink and you will miss Matt Frewer of Max Headroom fame as a trucker looking for a good time. While some have criticized Peter O'toole as lacking any emotional depth in his performance, I see him as a world-weary artist bored with his own existence and hungry for new adventures. Faye Dunaway is at her best as the evil sorceress Selena, although some would argue that Joan Crawford (Dunaway's character in Mommy Dearest) would beat Selena with a wire hanger given half the chance.  Brenda Vaccaro as Bianca seems to be for this film what Otis (Ned Beatty) was for Superman The Movie (and it's sequel) comic relief--although her attempts at humor often fall flat and many of her lines are largely un-necessary. Finally, Helen Slater in her movie debut as Supergirl stands her own against the many veteran actors in whose company she finds herself. She certainly looks the part and plays her dual role to perfection.

Overall, this is a very enjoyable, family-oriented film that doesn't require you to think too much. If you love deadly bumper cars, invisible monsters, run-away tractors, flying ballets, ghost trains, world domination, pseudo-magic, demon storms, teenagers dangling in cages, and the sky raining coconuts with pin point accuracy--then this movie is for you and for two hours you will believe... a girl can fly!",1189468800,4,5492,4.938244853737811

I hope to meet her someday, before I pass away because I love her, and I will always will! Anyhow, I will be as objective as I can. It is well know what the Salkinds tried to do: make more money by exploring all the possibilities from the Superman mithos. Therefore, Supergirl was the most obvious choice back then. Now, if we refer to the bad things: the story is not that bad, however, the naiveness and the holes in the plot are. There are too many things unreasonable within the story that if flaws of consistency. The treatment of the characters seems to pay tribute to those of Lex Luthor with a fool sidekick, Perry White=Mr. Danvers, Marc Maclure again as Jimmy Olsen, and the innocence of Kara (as Linda Lee) comparing it to Reeve's Clark Kent. NOW THE GOOD THINGS: The FX are amazing, even cooler than Superman III and Superman IV together. Kara flying ballet is just amazing, the phantom zone and the witch's 'witchery' are from the world beyond!! The Kara's character is one of the best performances, taking into account that it was her first major role. Helen really brought Kara to life, and not to mention that she looks so beautiful and hot in that costume. Even when the movie did not hit the box office it turned to be a legend! Everybody knows that Helen Slater is Supergirl, and probably she will be forever, a nostalgia comes when this movie is presented in TV. The DVD treatment is another two tumbs up. The special features where the director explains what he was trying to accomplish, Helen acting IN the costume, and her appreciations about the character at that time. The booklet and the Director's cut are just amazing, because it gives us additional footage that we would never imagined.

This is the female take on Superman. Literally.

Males are turds in this one and females are either lethal, clever or just super...

Not even Peter O'Toole can save face in this one, depicted as he is, as a heavy drinker. He does a great job of it though.

Helen Slater in the title role, and in her first major role appearance is not too bad, but in facts of acting, she is not a young Katherine Hepburn (although I doubt that Kathy would have accepted such a role to start with).

Faye Dunaway and Brenda Vaccaro do their very best to keep straight faces, while playing modern day ""would-be"" witches, trying to unleash the power of an object that Supergirl herself stole (or borrowed, as she states).

The story is weak and absolutely not to compare with the rest of the Superman movies, unless we take the last two incarnations (a mixture of Superman III and Superman IV perhaps).

But then again, what can one expect from cartoon characters?

Perhaps a touch of X-Men treatment?

Perhaps.

A bit more fleshed-out characters would have been in order. We actually know nothing of value of the characters shown. They-re just here.

Where have they come from, what are their backgrounds, where are they planning to go?

No one is really allowed any true insight in these facts.

They are just there to do what they were supposed to do all along.

So where's the thrill? Go figure...

I would have preferred to know more about Kara as a child, and perhaps also about Selina's (Faye Dunaway) past. Then perhaps, I would have included her growing up and a chance meeting with her adolescent cousin Clark Kent/Superman, either in the Fortress of Solitude or at his foster parent's farm.

But this was obviously too much to ask.

Instead we are treated to a pure campy and at times idiotic cartoon-like movie, flat as can be and as uninventive as can come.

Not even the Director's cut, which I also own, indeed Jeannot Szwarc's very vision and take on the movie could do it justice.

The DVD comes as stated in the uncut and unrated European theatrical version (that doesn't mean that it is in PAL or Region 2 format, NO. It is in the regular Region 1 U.S. format, just in case you were confused by it). It is in 2.35:1 ratio enhanced for 16:9 TVs and in a clean Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound.

There is even a villianess sub-plot with two Midvale School girls that really add to this womanly film.

This movie was panned by the critics, but I feel that any true DC fan or fan of the superman legend must own it. The plot is interesting and the villains are a big hokey, but I found Helen Slater's performance of a visitor to earth, new to her powers absolutely captivating. The flying is so real, because Slater truly acts the way we all imagine we would if we suddenly had the power to fly. Her performance is amazing, the effects are awesome, and the story is unique. It's a true spin off, but it ties into the superman legend quite masterfully.

Kara and her mentor Zaltar lose the Omega Hedron, which condemns Argo City to slowly dying from lack of oxygen and power. Motivated by guilt and a sense of Responsibility, Kara steals Zaltar's spaceship and travels to earth where the Omega Hedron has fallen into the hands of an ameteur witch named Selina. Selina uses the Omega Hedron to fuel her spells and become all-powerful. Supergirl must track down the Omega Hedron and take it from Selina before Argo City dies.",1174262400,2,1304,4.470588235294118

The ""inner space"" city of Kryptonians looked awful and seemed a weak premise for introducing her. It was also ridiculous how she needed some capsule to get her to Earth, through what appeared to be space, but she returned by flying into a lake?

Ok, given the premise that she needs to find the power source for her city in order to save it from destruction, why is she bothering with a secret identity? It is a waste of time, both for the film itself, and for her mission. The purpose of a secret identity is to be able to live a ""normal"" life while not in your superhero persona. As Supergirl never had any intention of staying on Earth longer than it took to find the Omega-hedron, the secret identity is pointless. It is also detrimental to her search (she detects it in the car driving away, but does not want to get in trouble for ditching class, so lets the car get away?)

The romance with the gardener adds nothing to the story and, other than his looks, there's nothing special about him that should be causing Supergirl and her witch rival to be fighting over him so intently.

Finally, the fact that the villain is a witch that got her power because fortune dropped the Omega-hedron in her lap, almost literally, was very weak.

Lastly, the denomic monster at the end will be keeping me from letting my kids watch this one for some time.

I'd love to see a remake in whcih the actress does as good a jab as Helen Slater does as protraying Supergirl, only with a new storyline that makes sense.",1173744000,2,1824,4.45945945945946

Helen Slater is great and looks absolutley stunning as SuperGirl, and her naive portrayl of the character will make even the hardest of this films critics still fall in love with her!
There are rumblings of a remake every couple of years with this film but to be honest before anything like that happens I would like to see this one get the same treatment as the Richard Donner Cut of Superman 2, as I believe this film was originally a lot longer and also went through many of the same production problem as the Superman films with various re-writes, edits and release delays!

Some films don't age well.  Some weren't that good to begin with.  Supergirl, sadly, falls into the latter category.  Nevertheless, the film isn't a complete waste of time.  Helen Slater does her best with the incomprehensible script.  And the flying sequences are best of all the big-screen ""Super"" films.  No CGI here, folks.  This is 1984, and that's really Slater (or her double in the long shots) up there on wires.

The film was previously available from Anchor Bay in an extended addition, with 24 extra minutes of footage edited back in.  This WB release is the ""European version,"" with 10 additional minutes added to the theatrical cut.  The extra stuff doesn't amount to much; it's mostly extended scenes with Faye Dunaway and Peter Cook.  Only hardcore Supergirl fans (if there are any?) will care about these minor changes.

The film is virtually the same transfer of the international version as used on the Anchor Bay release, along with the commentary track by Bosco and Szwarc. (Interestingly, WB uses the famed John Williams Superman theme on the menu screens, despite the theme not being used in the film.)

The film was one of the most underappreciated entries of 1984, but is really worth watching, and only in the famed ""international version"", and not in the heavily butchered theatrical version, which will hopefully never see the light of day on DVD ever.  The film focuses heavily on fantasy aspects, with most of the Sci-fi aspects that made the whole Superman franchise.

All in all, this DVD as a whole allows WB to make amends for giving up on this film before it ever got out of the gate.  Hopefully, WB can go in when we see the next round of DVD tie-ins in 09 when the next Superman movie comes out, and revisit this film and even give us the ""Director's Cut"" with a more wider release than the utterly expensive and limited edition that Anchor Bay gave us.",1167177600,41,1276,4.648888888888889

The 2 DVD set contains both the director's cut and the international version (far superior to the edited version released in the U.S. back in '84), tons of great extras, and an impressive booklet. The movie looks and sounds excellent. The director's commentary is also informative and entertaining. It's a nice package and a charming movie. Slater is perfectly cast. Dunaway is over-the-top.

Supergirl was supposed to be the complimentary series to the Superman movies, but I guess we should be greatful that this one fell flat on its face at the first try rather than burning out like Superman IV.

Boasting an all star cast, Supergirl left her inner space home (inside planet Earth?!) to find the BenWah ball (also called an Omega Headron) that she lost to restore her home city's energy.  Faye Dunaway, the villaness, comes across it and uses it to take over the earth.  She and her happy, bumbling fool of a side kick provide a few laughs, but don't have nearly the magic that Lex and Otis do in the Superman movies.  Faye Dunaway adds a camp aspect to it that makes one smile a bit, but her face was pulled so taught you could probably bounce a quarter off of it.

This, you would rightly assume, would mean I have some RIGHT crapola in my collection. And hoo boy, are there some stinkers - Catwoman, Howard The Duck, Justice League pilot (even if they're unofficial I must still have them).

And you know what? This is the worst of the lot.

Not that Supergirl doesn't look very nice in her little outfit, but even that can't save this abomonation, quite simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

Huh? Why? What for?

Just one of the utterly surreal things that happen in this movie (and poor Peter Cook just looks humilated being in it). When the best thing you can say about any movie is the guy who plays Jimmy Olsen in the Superman movies is in it.. woah, you KNOW there's something wrong.

422375,3,630200098X,"""Supergirl"" is a mixed bag for fans of the Superman series of films. Much has been said of it's failings, which are mainly in the lack of logical writing. For example: When Kara takes her ride through the dimensional tunnel to earth, she suddenly goes from wearing the white dress to a complete Supergirl costume! Where did it come from? Why did it appear? Details like this drive a true-blue comics fan nuts. The film-makers ascribe it to magic, I suppose, but there's never any reason given.

However, the one area where this film shines, is the flying scenes. In many instances surpassing similar scenes in the Superman movies, they are done not only realistically but breath-takingly exciting and inspiring. Her initial flight scene, an extended sequence, is worth the price of the DVD, and several subsequent scenes as she flies searching for signs of the lost power source, are equally great. Helen Slater brings an innocence and strength to the role, and wears the cape well.

Too bad the plot and story are so poor. Hopefully we will one day soon see another, much better Supergirl movie, if the efforts to revive the franchise succeed. It would be neat to see Slater play Kara's mother this time!

Many of the criticisms against Supergirl (how she knows of Earth, knows of Superman, speaks English, transforms her clothing) have already been featured in the previous Superman movies. If Jorel can program a Kryptonian space ship to teach baby Kalel Chinese philosophy and Einsteins theory of relativity thousands of years before Einstein (!)why can't his brother Zorel also have knowledge of Earth in Argo City? Superman often just transforms into his Superman duds in his movies (in the first Superman his clothes transform into his coustume as he's falling from a window with no explanation) so why can't Supergirl transform in the same manner especially with possible help of Kryptonian technology along the lines of the Omegahadron? It hardly seems fair to be overly critical of these types of things in Supergirl and not be critical of them in the Superman movies. As for the Phantom Zone: The evil Kryptonians of Superman II who came from the Phantom Zone would have recieved a huge amount of press and Superman was always providing info to the Daily Planet which was read by his enemies and used against him (it happens in Superman and Superman III for instance). Since Selena or one her cronies would know of the Phantom Zone from such a source there's no reason to be critical of that plot point either. These supposed errors aren't errors.

How the naive Kara knows so much about Earth? How she can appear with the Supergirl costume on Earth. These details have not bothered me, maybe because I read too much science fiction. Arthur C.Clarke, the author of 2001:A space odyssey says that ""any advanced technology will look like magic"". And Kara cames from a very advanced technological society. Argo City is centuries beyond our present technological horizon. They could have costumes made of smart fabrics, with nanotechnological fibers that enable the user to change the shape and colour of his or her costumes. So Kara can ""morph"" her costume to became a schoolgirl uniform, a Super-heroine costume, a casual Argo city dress or anything else. This is probably made by mental commands, as Zaltar sculpting wand. She can also change the colour of her hair, from blond to brunnette and back.

As to her knowing so much about Earth, that is also easily explainable. Even with our presente technology our civilization has sent probes to other planets, the advanced people em Argo can do the same, or listen to radio and TV programs emanating from Earth. I think that at the school in Argo the classes watch the TV news programs of Earth, the nearest civilized world, and so, a good student as Kara knows about Superman exploits and learned to speak english so well.

Well, now we only need to explain how Selena managed to control the Oomegahedron. Well, I will left this to you as a imagination exercise.

The end product is a really cheesy take on the Maid of Might, Kara Zor-El, the original Supergirl. In fact, it's so cheesy that watching this DVD is pure nostalgic fun. I'm a child of the cheesy 1980s anyway!
The flying effects here are not as good as those in the Superman movies but then who needs effects. Helen Slater as Supergirl/Linda Lee is the best special effect in this movie. Additional points should be given in that this movie is set in the Superman movie continuity - we get to meet Lucy Lane (Lois' sister) and Jimmy Olsen. A newsreader on a car radio informs us that Superman is off-planet at this time, thus explaning his rather glaring absence in this movie.
The story centers on Kara's childish mistake in Argo City that supposedly doomed the city unless she can make amends by coming to earth to retrieve something called the Omegahedron (or something like that!). Unfortunately this Omega-thingy is now in the hands of two ugly aunties (Faye Dunaway is one of them) who lusts after this young man (can't even remember his name). This young man is also in love with Supergirl. Then the auntie (Faye) decides to bring about the end of the world. And yes, Peter O'Toole also appears (although I still can't see the purpose of his character in the film).

The movie itself is rare!  I liked it a lot just because it was so gleefully silly.  Everybody looks like they are having a great time biting down on the comic book material.  You really can't go wrong!  Faye Dunaway is a hoot and a half!  And Helen Slater plays wide-eyed wonder to the hilt!  And Brenda Vacarro is so FUNNY as Bianca.

422459,3,630200098X,"Can anybody think of any major feature film superheroine movies out for the last 20 years? Most likely you'll only remember Supergirl. That's because we've only been given all-male superhero movies (with the exception of X-men, but that's a band of superheroes, and Batgirl - and she's just a sidekick). From Superman and Batman to Spiderman and the Daredevil - now the Hulk...there's still no real movie focused on a single superheroine around.
This is why I like Supergirl, as it stands above the rest in this area. I collect DVD's and VCD's (Video Compact Discs) of all the Superhero movies I could find, and Supergirl is a fine addition to the collection.
I remember quite well when the movie came out in 1984. It was all hype. They've boasted about having a powerhouse cast (which it has) and having the finest filmakers in the world involved in the project (minus the scriptwriter). But the movie turned out to be a letdown. Huge plot holes can be found in the story as wide as the meteor hole-pocked Sea of Tranquility (that's on the moon). I didn't realize this then because I was just a teenager then who didn't know what a good movie was supposed to be, but I thought it was my all-time favorite.
Even though I knew the story left so much to be desired, I still bought this DVD because of the pure joy of seeing Supergirl in action. You'll never find anything like this anywhere. If only the producers picked a much better screenwriter then, this would have been a top notch movie like Superman I and II. If you see Jeanot Swarc, the director, doing his work in the making-of featurette, you'll know he knew what he was doing. My impression is that he was desperately doing his best to do the best movie out of a script made in hell (pardon the language).
If you don't mind the story being in the way of your enjoyment seeing Superman's cousin in action, then this DVD is worth buying. A great addition to Superhero (or Superheroine) movie collectors like me.",1056153600,3,1969,4.564971751412429

422461,2,630200098X,"Anchor Bay released the Special Edition 2 DVD set for 'Supergirl' some time ago.  They only released 50,000 copies worldwide too.  When you think about it, 50,000 copies isn't very many for the world.  Yet, why are there still copies left to buy?  Simple answer - the movie was garbage.  I saw the international version back in 1984 which was supposed to make more sense than the butchered US theatrical version, but the movie still stunk! Don't get me wrong, I admire Anchor Bay for releasing titles on DVD that perhaps the big companies prefer not to, but Supergirl is a very bad movie.  it should have been kept at the bottom of the vaults marked ""never to be seen again in anyone's lifetime"".  Back in 1984, when we sat through the international version it ran for a whopping 124 minutes! I always prefer to let a movie run its entire length to give it a chance.  By the end of it, I wish I hadn't.  It was a silly storyline.  It ruined Fay Dunaway's career, and didn't do anything to help Helen Slater's new career (at the time the movie was tipped to make her a huge star). I fortunately won't be buying this DVD.

422462,5,630200098X,"In 1978 there came Superman, followed in 1980 by Superman II which was a direct continuance of the story. Superman and Superman II are the best when we think of the Superman movies. The attempted comedy of Superman III in 1983 was a disaster, and Superman IV The Quest For Peace in 1987 was a cheapo version, especially considering the disgustingly terrible special effects. Between Superman III and Superman IV, in 1984 there came Supergirl. Commercially it wasn't very successful and is often considered as one of the worst ever blockbusters, something which I didn't understand then, and really can't believe now. However, Supergirl has come to DVD and you're about to realize what you've been missing all this time.
To cut a long story short, Superman's cousin Kara is on a mission on Earth to find the Omegahedron. The Omegahedron is the life source of Argo City, a place where those who survived the destruction of Krypton (where Superman was born) now live. The Omegahedron was lost in an accident caused by Kara. It got sucked out of Argo City into space and landed on Earth. Since it is her fault and all those who live in Argo City will die if she doesn't get the Omegahedron back soon, Kara is determined to return it. When Kara leaves Argo City in a small ship and lands on Earth she discovers she now has the same powers as Superman- she can fly, has superstrength, x-ray vision, heat vision, superhearing and superbreath. Unfortunately a witch has found the Omegehedron and is planning on using it's power to create an evil shadow over Earth in which she will rule. Since Superman is negotiating piece with an alien race several trillion light years away, Kara as Supergirl is the only the one who can save the planet.
Supergirl starts off like Superman did with an introduction to the character and a story that begins to get you excited as we meet this new character. The opening credits themselves look fantastic and actually surpass the Superman opening credits. There is a real 3D effect to them, and the music by Jerry Goldsmith although not remembered now, is certainly on a par with John William's original Superman score. Helen Slater plays Supergirl and she is as much Supergirl as Christopher Reeve was Superman, perhaps even more so. Helen Slater has a perfect blend of innocence and strength, something which we only started to see in the late 1990s in shows such as Buffy The Vampire Slayer. Helen Slater is also beautiful, so making Supergirl beautiful. Supergirl basically becomes someone who can impress male audiences and be admired by female audiences. Faye Dunaway is the witch and although quite dull in comparison to Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor in the Superman movies, she does help the character of Supergirl to shine.
The movie itself has plenty of action, yet is also endearing. There are comedic moments and a love interest. In 1984 audiences didn't give Supergirl a real chance, but now, you can.
As for the DVD itself, it is a very impressive one from Anchor Bay. This Limited Edition version of Supergirl has 2 Discs and features 2 versions of the film. When Supergirl was released there were various complications regarding studios and distribution and so Supergirl ended up being cut several times. This also could have been responsible for how successful Supergirl was. The version shown in 1984 in US theatres is the shortest version and was released on video shortly afterwards. A while later when Supergirl was broadcast on television, some of the scenes that were cut were restored. It was also this version that was shown internationally. Disc 1 of the DVD features this international version of Supergirl. Recently in the UK, the original uncut version of Supergirl was discovered, and it is this which is the definitive director's version of Supergirl, now located on Disc 2.
Disc 2 doesn't have any other extras except for this directors cut. Note that the sound is in mono and the picture is not THX mastered, but if you're a fan of this movie, this is a real find for you. Disc 1 has the international version which is THX mastered and in Dolby Digital 5.1. The Special Features include a Commentary by director Jeannot Szwarc (which probably should have been put on the Director's Cut but what the hey!) and expert Scott Bosco. There is also a 50 minute ""Making Of"" originally made at the time, and is done the way making ofs should be made today. In addition, there is an Extensive Booklet with interviews and photos which is fascinating, as well as
TV Spots and trailers fron the US, the UK and Germany. I have to admit, the trailers are probably my favorite of the special features, apart from the making of, and the commentary....oh my god, there is just so much that is wonderful about this DVD set!

But the fact is that it is pretty good, ok Supergirl acts more like a fantasy fairy tale then Superman did just like Superman 3 Supergirl has a quite a lot of humour which I guess gives more of a comic book movie.
Anyone who is not famliar with Supergirl the movie well Supergirl is Superman's female cousin and comes to Earth to search for a cosmic power source that will save her world from destruction.
The innerspace and outerspace thing is never explained in the film but basically what is meant by that is another dimension Supergirl is basically another self from a Krypton which when it exploded some of it stayed alive.
Christopher Reeve was suppose to have appeared in Supergirl but dropped out of it before filming started.
If he had been in it, it would have had a much different story with Supergirl not only trying to save her planet but a powerless and aging Superman.
But cause of Chris dropping out the script changed completely, Supergirl the movie an excellent film that could have been better especially with Superman in it, but still if your a fan of Helen Slater or comic books your mostly like this film.

Someone had brought up how Kara knew so much of Earth when she first got there, well it seems her uncle (?) Zaltar (Peter O'Toole) was observing Earth from the city for quite a while, so it is only logical that as she hung around him, she too would learn of Earth, and of Clark Kent.
As to her ""magically"" changing, well, I guess for time consideration, and it was a trick used in the other Superman movies that worked, so why not here?
I must admit that the absence of Christopher Reeve as Superman in the movie is what bothered me, and I bet that the movie would have been made differently of Chris were available to appear. In the early comics, Superman was very much her mentor, guiding and shaping her into what she had become, but in this the absence of Superman made for a different story. [BTW: His absence is explained as him being on some mission on an alien planet.]
Looks wise, they did pick the right girl to play her, Helen Slater is an extremely attractive woman, and did make that costume look quite nice on her and handled the flying sequences quite wonderfully.

In a second viewing years later I can appreciate this film much more.  The special effects are good; the flying sequences are actually beautiful.  Slater is better than I remembered her too.
Supergirl lacks the sense of wonder that Superman and Superman II had, but it really is a very fun film and in all honesty, it is vastly superior to the last two Superman films.  Sure, this one has camp elements to it, but I really think it adds to the enjoyment.
I find it hard to really hate any film with Faye Dunaway, but even putting that bias aside Supergirl does not deserve its stinker reputation - as other reviewers here have obviously also discovered.
The DVD edition is great, but I find it a little sad watching the making of documentary in which cast and crew prematurely discuss the film's imminent blockbuster status and Helen Slater's imminent superstar status.  Perhaps they jinxed it?",1015459200,3,1064,4.613756613756614

Helen Slater was perfect for the title role - a real beauty who looks pretty darn good in that super-costume, but she wasn't given anything of interest to do, except fawn over a cute (but incredibly dim) 80's style hunk.
Poor Faye Dunaway tried her best but I kept expecting her to start screaming about wire hangers a la Mommie Dearest. I'm sorry but having Joan Crawford plotting world domination left me a little cold !
The special visual effects were (in my opinion) not that bad for the time, but there were not enough of them.... I guess they were very costly to produce, and therefore were given a limited screen presence.
But did I enjoy it....? Surprisingly enough yes I did ! As long as you watch this movie in the right context, and ensure that your tongue is planted firmly in cheek, you'll have some fun with this.

422493,1,630200098X,"There is a long (though presumbably not proud) tradition of highly trained English actors prostituting themselves in trashy American movies. Alan Rickman's role in ""Galaxy Quest"" parodies the practice even as it embodies it - a pretty neat trick. Laurence Olivier in ""The Betsy"" was once considered the standard-bearer in this field. Jeremy Irons in ""Dungeons & Dragons"" shows how far the state of the art has been advanced since then. But, to my mind, Peter O'Toole's appearance in ""Supergirl"" sets a record that will never be broken. It is truly one of the great spectacles of human self-abasement. If you have ever paid money to watch a carnival geek bite the head off a chicken (or would, given the opportunity), you owe it to yourself to see this movie.
And what better way to do so than with this limited 2-disc special edition! I suppose I shouldn't sneer; plenty of my favorite movies are unlikely to ever appear on a Top 100 list from the American Film Institute. But this really seems like one of the most demented conceptions for a consumer product that I've ever seen. ""The director's cut"", for God's sake? You mean it was actually an Eric Stroheim-caliber masterpiece before those vulgarians at the studio got their philistine hands on it?
I don't have anything against camp. Honestly. I think ""Big Trouble in Little China"" is one of the best comedies of the 80s and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise. (Well, maybe I'll just say something really sarcastic about him after he leaves.) But I have a fierce enmity against incompetent movies that, to save face, try to pretend that they're camp. It devalues the currency.
One scene in particular demonstrates the utter lack of entertainment value in this fiasco. Supergirl is confronting two evildoers - street ""toughs"" who look like they belong in a Michael Jackson video. One lecherously begins to lift up the hem of her skirt, to see what color her super-panties might be. (Admit it: if you're reading this, you've wondered yourself.) Supergirl slaps his hand away (not even with super-strength - no broken bones here) and primly chastises him to ""Stop that!"" It's as if, in the middle of ""American Pie"", Shannon Elizabeth put on a bulky sweater and recited a Catherine MacKinnon lecture on the objectification of women.",1006732800,8,2285,4.876606683804627

Dunaway and Cook are really out of place in this film. This film is so annoyingly campy it makes Superman 3 & 4 seem like horror movies in comparison. The action scenes are tepid and unimaginative. I generally dislike female incarnations of male superheroes (like Batgirl!!) as it is a sign of a lack of creativity on the part of the comic book writers. It is much better to create a new female superhero, rather than to just recycle the traits of existing superheroes into female characters. The only saving grace of this turkey is the performance by Helen Slater who puts her best into the role, particularily that of Supergirl's alter ego of Linda Lee. Unfortunately she is not really given any great dialogue playing Supergirl as the story declines into some silly romantic comedy when it should have focused on the conflict between good and evil. I'm glad that this film flopped at the box office in 1984.

422495,4,630200098X,"I was one of the many who first saw 'Supergirl' during it's theatrical release, and were stunned into disbelief by plotholes you could drive a TRUCK through, some really bargain basement FX, and acting that ranged from sleepwalking (O'Toole), to blandly sincere (Slater), to 'Mommy Dearest...The Sequel' (Dunaway). While the film wasn't QUITE as horrendous as 'Superman III' had been, it came close, and the critical and audience reaction soured the Salkinds on the entire 'Superman' franchise (they passed the torch to Golan/Globus, with Christopher Reeve taking on much of the production duties for 'Superman 4'.)
It is surprising, therefore, that the Special Edition 2-Disc DVD is amazingly good! Loaded with extras, it gives the viewer an enlightening glimpse at the behind-the-scenes work that creates a motion picture, from the casting (Slater was a charming, unpretentious girl of 19 when she won the role, and you can see her 'grow into' the part during the filming), to the tension on set (Jeannot Szwarc was not the easiest man to work with, and you can see him 'age' during the long shoot), to the marketing of the film (trying to revitalize a franchise that was already past its prime). 'Superman' expert Scott Bosco puts the film into perspective, noting its many flaws, but also acknowledging that there were good points, as well (there was a ballet-like quality to Slater's flying scenes, as well as her exuberance at having superpowers). Best of all is Szwarc's commentary...while he acknowledges that the film didn't turn out entirely as he had hoped, he was able to make it a more personal film than Richard Lester had, in his 'Superman' efforts.

The viewer is given two versions of the film to choose from; a slightly lengthened theatrical version, and a 'Director's Cut', with a lot of extra footage that never made it to the theatres.
While 'Supergirl' has never achieved more than a campy cult status, the Special Edition DVD 'set the bar high', and showed the industry what 'Special' meant.

I am an advocate for good comic book based movies and this should be up there with the likes of Superman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Blade.  Helen Slater really made Kara believeable. Actually, all of the acting is pretty top notch. With the likes of Peter O' Toole, Faye Dunway, and Brenda Vaccaro this was more than a adventure film. The score is beyond words.

422535,4,630200098X,"Supergirl seems to grow on you after a while.  It's not the powerhouse that the first two Superman films were, but it definately has it's own unique story to tell.  Helen Slater does a very nice job in the title role.  She comes across as goodnatured, if not a bit naive since she knows very little about the people of Earth.  Catch Matt Frewer (Max Headroom, Honey I Shrunk The Kids) as one of the thugs who tries to take advantage of her when she first arrives.
The interaction between Selena (a nicely wicked Faye Dunaway) and her friend Bionca (Brenda Vaccaro) make for some fun dialogue.  Just a couple of gals having fun and dabbling in black magic.  It's a nice bit of comic relief that fits quite nicely in the film.
...on the radio in one scene it is stated that Superman is off on another planet doing some diplomatic business and this is why he's not around.  Actually, Christopher Reeve was considering being in the film.  He would've been the one to show Supergirl around, and at the end, Supergirl would end up saving his life, but this would never come to pass after he decided not to be in the film.  But one of my favorite moments is when Kara (Slater) walks into Lucy Lane's dorm room and sees the poster of Superman on the wall and just slowly puts her hand on it.  I really liked that.
I highly recommend you pick up this 2 Disc Set before it's no longer available.  Only 50,000 copies were made and once they're gone...they're gone.  And although a single disc version will remain available, what you lose on the 2nd disc is the director's cut which adds on an additional 15 minutes of footage that rounds out more of the story and character development, paticularly, Jimmy Olsen (Marc McClure) and Lucy Lane (Maureen Teefy)'s relationship.
I was somewhat surprised when Supergirl came out on DVD before any of the Superman films did.  I was also disappointed that, with the exception of the first Superman movie, none of the sequels contained any additional scenes or extra features.  Kind of makes me wish Anchor Bay had the rights to these films.  Then they'd all be 2 disc Collector's editions like Supergirl.  Even Superman: The Movie isn't a 2 Disc Set.  Instead, Warner Brothers used both sides of one DVD, so it can't have any cover art like all the other films.  Supergirl actually has the most impressive packaging.  A nice two box snap case, with cover art on both DVDs as well as a nifty 16 page booklet that gives you more information.
The extras on Supergirl rival the extras on Superman: The Movie.  In fact I'd say if it wasn't for the fact that Superman contains 3 retrospective documentaries and an isolated music score, Supergirl would beat it hands down.  The featurette, hosted by Faye Dunaway is an hour long and is very enjoyable to watch.  You get all the trailers (U.S. and Foreign) and U.S. TV spots, storyboards, still & poster galleries of some very nice artwork.  This stuff should've been on the Superman DVDs.

Okay, maybe there's not much of that either, except for Helen Slater, but hey, she wears some of the hottest outfits you've ever seen in this movie! Normally she doesn't turn me on, but in this movie she pulls it off bigtime! I was a kid when this came out. A real junkie for the Superman movies and totally ready to see his hottie cousin in action. I remember seeing it at the movies and I'm not sure what I thought about it at the time, but I think I liked it. As for now, well, I rented it about a year ago, and after that couldn't help but spring for the DVD 2 pack! I must admit it was a really cool experience! Sure the story is corny and full of holes, but this is such a FUN movie! Right up there with Cloak and Dagger for 80's fun! This movie delivers, maybe not in the same way as the first two Superman films, but it still delivers! I'm not familiar with the comics. My love for comic characters is confined mainly to movies and TV, with the exception of Disney, Sailor Moon, Star Wars and Indiana Jones comics, but I'm sure most comic fans would be pleased with at least some aspects of the film.

Somehow, the Salkinds were of the opinion that making this as silly as possible would make it a hit. They threw in the requisite all-star cast, with Mark McClure (Jimmy Olsen) along to tie it into the ""Superman"" movies. And, a poster-only appearance by Christopher Reeve. But the scenes with Faye Dunaway, Brenda Vaccaro and Peter Cook are just too over-the-top to make them viable villians. (They should've called Gene Hackman for lessons on walking the fine line between parody and menace.) Slater gives Linda/Supergirl just the right heart and enough sex appeal to keep this one from being a total waste.

422540,4,630200098X,"This movie was definately made with the pre-teen girl in mind. A squeaky clean Slater as the Girl of Steel has all the honesty and innocense needed to carry off her character. Faye Dunaway plays the evil sorceress who wants to rule the world by starting off with a small Mid-Western town and the Tom Cruise look-alike landscape man.
Explained simply enough, Superman is on a peace-keeping mission trillions of light years away. Supergirl actually comes from an asteroid that survived Krypton's explosion. Peter O'Toole explains how they live in 'Innerspace'. Very confusing when you consider Supergirl flew in a magic orb off her asteroid, flew through the all too familiar 'vortex' and 'time rifts' to finally fly (in costume of course which magically appears) out of a lake on Earth. Of course when she lands dry as a bone on the shore, you wondered what you missed or what the heck is going on. But these comic book movie adaptions are not for the detail retentive who can tear this film apart.
The love interest is what little girls dream of. A landscape guy who falls in love with Linda Lee (Supergirl in disguise) after a magic spell by Dunaway goes wrong. Linda practices kissing herself in the mirror after their first kiss, girl stuff to be sure.
Well it's a good flick for me for a couple of reasons. Slater and Dunaway both look hot. Watch Dunaway flash her thighs a couple of times. And no guy can resist Slater in that VERY TIGHT Supergirl costume. She's got a great rack that make that big 'S' really stand out. Watch in the end of the film when she faces Dunaway in her evil fortress for the first time. When she sees Loverboy chained to a wall, she walks towards him and hits an invisible forcefield.

There is the 1984 'Making of Supergirl' one hour documentary, which chronicles everything from day 1.  Then there are several TV spots, domestic and foreign trailers (these are fun, especially the German one), storyboard art, talent bios, and tons of color and black & white stills from the movie.  In addition to all of this, there is a neat 16 page color booklet which reprints some of the original promotional movie tie-ins like contests and games.  I can't believe somebody actually managed to dig all of this up!

The movie itself is a nice, crisp transfer with 5.1 digital surround sound.  The audio commentary by the director and the special project consultant is among the most informative and fun I have ever listened to.

To its credit, this film performs much better as a major motion picture after viewing the 138 minute director's cut included on disc 2 and seeing the original intent of the filmmakers.  Cutting out a half-hour of footage from any movie is bound to affect the flow of the plot and characterization.  Anchor Bay Entertainment should be commended for taking a widely panned movie and giving it the VIP treatment, proving irrefutably that it is possible to produce a great DVD for an under-appreciated movie.",989020800,30,1878,5.144736842105263

Plus the 2 disc set has several extra's.  Most of which I had never seen before.  I Highly recommend buying this version of Supergirl just so you can compare the International Version to the Director's Cut.

Ever since I was little, Christopher Reeve was and I'm sure is everyone's favorite Superman, and that same feeling applied to Helen Slater as Supergirl! Like Reeve is Superman to all of us, Helen was Supergirl(the very first one also) to all of us! Even though there is the scene with Helen looking at a poster of Chris Reeve, I always wished they could have worked together, and I have to wonder if they have even meet each other personally! Though I grant that the movie should have made more sense to all of us, I for one label it as my all-time favorite movie because scenes were restored totally than on the VHS, and one of my favorites was a scene between Marc McClure and Maureen Teefy who are held captive in Dunaway's castle! I think the DVD special edition added more layer to Slater's character! What's really great was the making of the movie special they included along with the original theatrical trailers! For me, it's like seeing Szwarc's film for the first time, and it's not the first time he got this type of scrutiny! Remember, he directed Chris Reeve in Somewhere in Time! It's funny, the other night, I remember having a dream where this movie came out for a 20th anniversary release, and it looked absolutely beautiful!

422572,4,630200098X,"""Supergirl"" hit the American theater screens in November of 1984, it did fairly well that first weekend, then faded into the backwash of movies that pop up from time to time at 3:00 in the morning while your up with a sick kid.  The film is of little or no importance to film historians, usually looked upon as ""The movie that was better than Superman III"".  The film eventually found a niche among a small band of followers that saw it for what it was, a heck of a lot of fun!
Helen Slater dbuts as the Girl of Steel, Superman's cousin Kara from a doomed chunk of Krypton that's survived the planet's explosion. (All of this is only breezed over in the film, of course.) Slater does for this film what Reeve did for the other movies in the franchise, she -is- Supergirl when she's on screen, much as Reeve -was- Superman, their presence is almost tangible, you forget it's an actor in a silly costume and simply accept them as the characters.
The effects are, in a word, breathtaking, knocking the previous flying shots in the super-films to the ground hands-down.  The ""first flight"" Supergirl takes is among one of the most watchable effects sequences ever committed to film, and was done in a time before CGI...
Yes, the acting is often hammy and over-the-top (Particularly from the major ""names"" in the film), and, no it's not a knock-your-socks-off action/adventure...it's more a fairy-tale, as stated in the commentary track of the DVD. If you let yourself ease into it, it's one heck of a lot of fun.  The colors on the DVD transfer are incredible, from the swirly red and blue mists and fantastic chromes of the opening credits to the muted colors of the Phantom Zone, the movie looks better than it did in the theater.
If you've only seen this film on cable, or in the American Theater (or the dreadful quality VHS release of a few years back), give it a chance with this release, you haven't seen ""Supergirl"" at all.
The directors commentary track explains a lot about the ""Supergirl"" movie that almost was (initially slated to have been ""Superman III,"" I believe, as some of the storyboard cards presented in the supplements state) which would have featured Reeve as Superman, it makes us wonder what we may have missed...
But we've got this, and, all things considered, it ain't half bad...time to watch ""Supergirl"" again, for the first time...let the child inside out for a couple of hours...and believe a girl can fly...!",978048000,8,2436,4.658139534883721
422573,2,630200098X,"The amount of material on this DVD should rank ""Supergirl"" as a top-draw product.  When considering that the two-disc treatment puts it on a format scale with ""The Abyss"", ""T2,"" ""Gladiator,"" and ""Armageddon"" (blockbusters of varying artistic quality), it is a shock to realize that the film itself is only of the slightest entertainment value whatsoever.
The film was released in 1984 in a highly truncated 105-minute version, eliminating 10 minutes from the 124-minute international cut, and 10 additional minutes from the Director's Cut.  Both the international and Director's versions are here, as are trailers, previews, interviews and commentaries.  A deluxe treatment this, if only the film were of any value whatsoever.
Jeannot Szwarc has had a middling career at best -- highs include the derivative ""Jaws 2"" (1978) and the overlooked ""Somewhere in Time."" (1980)  It is unclear how Mr. Szwarc continues to find work, as there seems to be a vast disconnect between his aspirations and his reality.  One cannot fault Mr. Szwarc for this, however, as other filmmakers have gotten farther with less.  (Are you listening, Mr. Verhoeven?)  The aspirations behind his film here are noble, attempting to set up a modern-day ""Wizard of Oz.""  There are moments (a few) where the film succeeds, most notably in the truly balletic scene where Kara/Supergirl first discovers her ability to fly.  The aerial movement which follows is amazing in its tenderness -- it is a welcome contrast to the action which accompanied the ""Superman"" films.
Unfortunately, the script fails to execute properly.  When the most dramatic scene in the film is a tractor run amuck, we know something is wrong.  While Superman saved the world from nuclear weapons, Supergirl is left to save a small town from fascistic rule by a homegrown witch?  Why didn't she simply fly to the state capital and call down the National Guard?  The character and the myth is too large for the film which holds it.  The romance between Kara and Ethan is equally painful.  While feminizing the hunk (he faints a LOT) paints an interesting picture of the first ""him-bo"", the execution again is painful, as our complete lack of interest in the character renders him annoying (at least Lois Lane had some spunk).
Playing into the witchcraft aspect could have provided us with an interesting supernatural/spiritual contest.  (After all, Superman never had to face the devil, although the script for ""Superman IV"" must have had Faustian influence to have been made in the first place.)  However, the payoff never comes.  If Selena had truly tapped into ultimate power, again, why would she stay in East Podunkville?  If her aspirations truly were for world domination (and again, we would have liked to have understood why), why don't we ever see her actually conquering the world?
Overall, the package for this DVD is amazing, certainly ranking it among the top tier of DVDs.  The set may be worth keeping only for documenting how admittedly noble ideals (long before there was the Slayer, there was the Supergirl) can conspire to make a truly horrible film.",977184000,,3108,5.045009784735812

Christopher Reeve, at this time, did not agree to be in this movie because he believed he had moved on from playing Superman(much to the blame of what a joke Superman III was). Ironically, though, he hadn't moved on, only to star in Superman IV in 1987. The film simply starts out in Argo City, not explaining why or how Argo split off from Krypton,(during the explosion) leaving a few unknown survivors. Kara tells her relatives in Argo City something to the effect of, ""I'll get to see my cousin Superman"", but when she arrives on earth, she never does. They try to fill the hole of Superman not being there,but it doesn't exactly work. There are a few nice touches in this movie, such as featuring Lucy Lane being Linda Lee's roommate, and Jimmy Olsen's (Marc McClure)role. There are very little explanations of how villainess Selena(Faye Dunaway) got her miraculous powers. There are numerous plot holes, and the movie is extremely dull. I expected it to be exciting and entertaining. The heavy overtones of Witchcraft, magic,etc.(all played for campiness)are disappointing. Did all the real villains leave town? Supergirl also seems very alone, never having anyone to talk to, but it's amazing how well she gets along without learning anything about earth. Supergirl is okay,the effects are very good, but the problem is, it's not extremely good or bad, it's just dull and mediocre.

All too often commercial considerations force the trimming of material whose absence detracts from the film and, all too often, destroys its inner structure and logic. Such was definately the case here.
My one complaint? Considering the trouble that was gone to to put together the ""uncut"" version of the film, I was astonished to note that the soundtrack, dialogue and all, was compressed into a not-very-effective MONOPHONIC mix! This was, technically, a major disappointment for what is otherwise a technically reasonable job.

422591,4,630200098X,"I know, most critics did not like this movie.  But that did not stop me from buying this special edition, which is limited to 50,000 copies.  I truly believe Anchor Bay has outdone itself in presenting Supergirl in both the International and Director's version.  The DVD also contains great stills from promotions and from the movie.  My only complaint about this DVD is that the Director's version, which is on a separate disc, is not encoded in DD 5.1.  (Of course, the International version is.)
Obviously, I did not buy this DVD for special features.  I truly do like this movie.  For one, the special effects were well ahead of its time and still quite fun to watch.  The so- called ""flying ballet"" sequence is one of the most beautiful and convincing flying scenes I have ever seen.  You will believe Supergirl is actually flying.  The movie also offers some platonic romance between Supergirl and Ethan (Hart Bochner) which is surprisingly welcome.  The scene where Supergirl rescues Ethan and flies him to safety is reminiscent of the ""Can you read my mind"" sequence from Superman I.
When discussing the virtues of this film, it is impossible to omit Ms. Faye Dunaway.  Faye, like all great actors, has the ability of turning a potentially ridiculous and embarrassing role into an acting lesson.  Before Glenn Close's Cruella DeVille, we have Faye as Selena, the has-been witch turned supervillain by the power of the Omegahedron.  It is Faye's intense and campy performance that stands out above everything in this movie, including Helen Slater's Supergirl looks.
So, what went wrong with this film that made Supergirl a box-office bomb?  I have to blame the scriptwriter.  The first half of the movie truly does not make much sense, nor does it serve to help the viewer understand the logic of the remainder of the film.  For example, when Supergirl arrives on earth and emerges from her spaceship, she is fully clothed in her Supergirl outfit.  How?  Nobody knows.  Later, when Supergirl decides to become Linda Lee, she changes hair color and uniform in the twinkling of an eye.  I'm sorry, but magical uniform changes were not one of the original Supergirl's powers.  Whatever enabled her to do this should have been explained in the beginning of the movie.  This also would have been a  time to explain why she had such an understanding of her new powers and the culture on earth.
If you can get passed these deficiencies (chalk them up to details left out in script rewrites), then you will truly enjoy this film, especially the second half.  Otherwise, you're better off passing on it.",970617600,9,2601,4.830316742081448
422592,5,630200098X,"Strangely, SUPERGIRL has obtained the reputation of being one of the worst blockbusters of all time - the question remains though, WHY?  Criticisms that it lacks the ""maturity"" or flair of the first two SUPERMAN films just aren't really fair.  I mean, surely the director didn't want the film to just be a SUPERMAN film with  the only difference being the lead character?  Indeed, SUPERGIRL certainly has it's own identity and rarely feels like a SUPERMAN clone, so hats off to the filmmakers on that one.
Helen Slater is actually perfect for the part, and it's a shame that she seems to have disappeared these days, whilst the supporting cast are hugely impressive, particularly the always reliable Peter O'Toole, whose scene with Slater in the Phantam Zone remains the most effective of the movie.  Faye Dunaway makes a splendidly over the top villain, even if her humorous portrayal means she lacks the danger that Hackman's Lex Luthor displayed in SUPERMAN, and Peter Cook is wonderfully sarcastic as the school teacher who likes to dabble in sorcery.
The real star of the film though is Jerry Goldsmith's amazing score, which lends the film a power it just wouldn't have otherwise.  A genuine classic score, it's testament to Goldsmith's talent, that he's able to bring so much to the quality and atmosphere of a movie like this.
Special effects wise, SUPERGIRL also impresses hugely, outclassing the SUPERMAN movies at evry turn.  Not only are the flying sequences absolutely stunning (helped by Slater's graceful presence), but the big-scale street sequence is still, for my money, one of the best ""live"" special effects sequences I've ever seen.  Superb.
Congratulations to Anchor Bay too, for presenting such a great DVD of an overlooked movie.  From the THX sound to the excellent, vibrant picture, it's a top class job that many other companies would do well to learn from.  The animated menus also add a nice finishing touch, and the extras are also brilliantly researched, with a very interesting commentary, an impressive gallery of pictures, photos etc, and best of all, the original making of documentary (over 50 minutes long) which is one of the best makings of I've seen on a blockbuster movie.

I really  wanted to like this movie and I guess I did on certain levels, but compared  to the first Superman movie this is disastrous.  I liked Helen Slater as  the girl of steel, and Faye Dunaway and Brenda Vaccaro ham it up in a  likable way, but these characters deserve respect and they really didn't  get it.  The plot, which has Kara (Supergirl) going to earth to retrieve an  energy source that will save her planet, needs a lot of work.  The special  effects need a lot of work, too.  It's as if the powers that be on this  film were afraid they were going to take a loss and they didn't spend any  more money than they could afford to lose.  Don't get me wrong; the film is  worth seeing, but play it safe and rent it first before you buy it.

The DVD  version would have gotta 5 stars if not for some inconsistence with the  remastering.  Firstly the sound seems to be not consistent in certain  scenes like the Flying Ballet. Very loud then suddenly soft.  Secondly, the  pictures on some scenes were very dark as if the lights suddenly went dim.  Thirdly the graphics on the Menu selections were a disaster. The movie  itself has been mocked by others as being too comical, with none of the  strength you would see in a Superman movie. The colours used were so  striking that you can probably see the menu from 50 miles away. I rather  they had stick with black and white.
Now the good side, overall the DVD  was well done. I could hear every bang and swash due to the THX  remastering. The pictures (almost all crystal clear) is 10 times more  superior to the VHS version that I have seen. The best part of this  collection is the 2nd disc with the director's cut and the extras added it,  it really paints a better and more complete story.
Those of you who wants  a decent movie story about Supergirl. Get this, chances you won't regret  it. After all, this maybe the only Supergirl movie ever made.

422626,5,630200098X,"""Supergirl"" 2 DVD set is really a new way to experience this movie. Now, I know that this film was not a huge success, however, ever  since I was a kid I really enjoyed Superhero movies, always being able to  dwell on their strengths rather than their faults. Given that, I purchased  a copy of this DVD set, rather excited to watch a new 2hr 18m Directors Cut  version of a film that Ive seen countless of times through the years...
  The Directors cut features footage that was cut off and left out of the  Domestic release. A shame, since the footage gave Supergirl and Selena more  depth than the U.S theatrical release gave them.
The Directors Cut alone  would have been worth buying had it been released as a single disc, but  this has more. On Disc one there is the ""International Version""  of the film featuring footage never seen in U.S (odd since I swear Ive seen  it before), but better than that it has an audio commentary by the  director. The A.C is really interesting because the director reveals  secrets to the films key scenes as to how they were filmed and script  changes (HE TALKS ABOUT HOW CHRISTOPHER REEVES, AS SUPERMAN, WAS A PIVOTAL  CHARACTER IN THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT).
Disc One also features a 45+ min  ""The Making of 'Supergirl'"" featurette which was originally aired  on ABC as a special. The featurette included screen-tests with Helen  (Slater, Supergirl), and the actual footage when shes told that she has the  part. Also, they show how they filmed many of the scenes. Its a really  interesting behind-the-scenes footage that has to be watched!
Also  included are countless trailers, TV spots and More. And the comic book  effect on the menu screen is great to. I would definitely get this set  before the publishers run out of stock...
For the film its self, Id give  3.5 stars, but this DVD set, with all it has to offer, definitely deserves  5 stars.",967248000,,1885,4.602409638554217
422627,4,630200098X,"Upon its release in 1984, ""Supergirl"" received only a few good reviews; but one of them was my then-hometown paper, the Detroit Free  Press.  That combined with the fact that I was already a SG fan helped me  enjoy the film.
16 years have passed, and now the original international  edition is out on DVD.  How does ""Supergirl"" hold up?  Surprisingly well.
Granted, some of the dialouge in this film is  embarrasingly bad.  But Helen Slater brings such an innocence to the title  role, and Faye Dunaway is so deliciously over-the-top as the wicked witch  Selena, that I can't help but enjoy ""Supergirl"".  The flying  sequences still look great after all these years -- and the Maid of Might's  aerial ballet in the opening act is a classic!
All things considered,  ""Supergirl"", while no masterpiece, is better than its reputation.  Give it a chance, and maybe you too will believe a girl can fly!",967248000,,896,4.7272727272727275
422628,3,630200098X,"As I listened to the Director's editorials for the international version of Supergirl, I was saddened by how good of a movie this could have been  but for the re-writes.  As it turns out, Jennot Szwarc was out of his  league directing this film.  This film is totally disjointed. When the  Director is asked if there is any explaination for Supergirl appearing in  her costume for the first time on earth, his response is ""no"".  Even the extra 24 minutes in the Director's Cut does little to help  audiences understand anything about how Argo survived the explosion of  planet Krypton, how Supergirl knows anything about Earth, how she knows  Clark Kent is Superman, etc.  This is truly a director's movie and Szwarc's  was not up to the task.  A strong cast also suffers from a lack of  direction.  Helen Slater was a comendable Supergirl/Linda Lee, but never  had the direction needed to truly develop her character.  Faye Dunnaway was  way over the top in her performance, making the character Selena  unbeliveable and at times, laughable.  There are very few actors better  than Ms. Dunnaway, however, the director needed to take a stronger hand in  controling her character.  Compare this to Gene Hackman in the Superman  films under the direction of Richard Donner and Richard Lester.  His  character could have been just as over the top if not for the fact the the  directors had control over those films.  The saving grace of this film  are the special effects.  The flying sequences in this film are worth  buying and watching the DVD.  Helen Slater is graceful and beautiful in  flight.  I remember when Christopher Reeve was interviewed on the Tonight  Show with Johnny Carson about Superman III and was asked what he thought  about Supergirl.  He stated that she does fly better than he does.  It is  also interesting to find out that Christopher Reeve was originally slated  to be in Supergirl but backed out after several script revisions.  It's  unforturnate because Superman's presence would have added some much needed  continuity to the film.  If anyone wants to see how great actors can  fail under the hands of a weak director, this is the film.  When you have a  cast that includes Peter O'toole, Faye Dunnaway, Peter Cooke and Mia  Farrow, a super film should be at hand.  Not this time. A disjointed script  and a director who is use to directing one hour television episodes sealed  the coffin on any Supergirl sequels and that is a shame because Helen  Slater would have made a great superheroine for many years to follow.",966384000,9,2547,4.791183294663573

Buy it for exactly what it is; an addition to the Salkind  Superman franchise.  It is shot with the same feel and look of the Superman  movies.  That alone makes it worth owning.  The story is bad and so are  most of the FX.  I still recommend it to any Superman fan.  It won't make  you turn it off!,966384000,3,458,4.1976744186046515

However, in spite of all of  its faults, I would highly recommend aquiring this movie if you are a fan  of the Christopher Reeve franchise of Superman.  This movie is worth  owning, if for no other reason, because it's filmed with the same look and  feel of the Superman movies.  And well it should since the Salkind's did  this movie also.  Helen Slater does a great job in the role of Supergirl.  It isn't her fault that the story is so bad!  There is a flying scene early  in the movie that alone makes it worth owning.

An attempt at starting a seperate franchise (Reeve was balking at  doing any more Superman movies), it tried to duplicate the formula, but  lacked the budget and writing of the first two Superman films. Still it is  great fun. Faye Dunaway is hysterical as Supergirl`s arch enemy. Helen  Slater is bland as the girl of steel, but she is so darn cute that you  don`t really mind. The plot is corny, the acting strictly comic book, and  the most amazing special effect is the way that, no matter in what position  Supergirl is flying or landing (including upside down!) her tiny red skirt  remains demurely in place. Not high art, but fun and no worse than Superman  3 or IV, to be sure. Definitely worth a look, as long as you accept it for  what it is.",966297600,4,832,4.379084967320262

A lot of tender loving care went into this release and it shows!  The two different  DVD menus on the discs are really well done and fun to look at.  The  'Director's Cut' version of the film really fleshes out the characters more  and adds a lot to the film.
An all-star cast, and a fun superhero movie  make this one a great film to pull out for the family, or fans of the  'old-school' innocent and heroic type superhero (non-dark & brooding  types like Spawn, etc).
The amount of information and features in this  package is phenomenal!  The entire hour long making of Supergirl was a joy  to watch.  Brand new cast bios and tons of trailers, T.V. Spots, etc. give  you everything you want to know about the film.
Sure it wasn't  financially successful, and the story is a little weaker than the early  Superman films (the arch enemy and Supergirl fought over a guy...where  Superman fought Lex Luthor over his Nukes!), but it is a fun movie and  welcome entertainment.
I was brought up on Superman, Rocky, and Star Wars  movies.  It's always great to see them again, and I am really happy with  this new cut of the film.

On this Two Disc Set, both the International Version and the  Directors Cut are an improvement. Although I am leaning towards the  Directors Cut being superior. The character development is more existential  and the campiness was curbed slightly. The commentary on the international  version is very insightful. The director even reveals the original plans  from when Christopher Reeve was going to have a cameo. The Making of  Featurette was very thorough. The story board are cool. The only gripe I  have is that the superior version (directors cut) is in mono (not 5.1) and  there is no commentary. It would have been a nice revealation to here the  directors stories and thoughts on his own original cut. The international  version has great sound and picture.

422660,3,630200098X,"SUPERGIRL is one of those films that one might think would benefit from additional footage. When I heard that there was a version coming out with an additional 24 minutes previously unseen by American audiences, I thought this would explain a lot of things. For instance, how did Argo City survive the destruction of Krypton? How did she get that costume? How could she even have known anything about Superman or his Clark Kent/Daily Planet connection? After all, she wasn't even born when the baby Kal-El was sent to Earth.
It is interesting to listen to director Jeannot Szwarc talk about how decisions were made, but it seems like a lot of wasted effort, although it explains a lot to find out how many last minute changes were made to the script. It would have made better sense to have the commentary on the ""director's cut"" version rather than the ""international version"". Even the usually reliable Jerry Goldsmith provides an unmemorable score.
I have never appreciated Szwarc's talent as a director. Besides the fact that this story is not very good, Szwarc's direction lacks pace, suspense, and scale. The extra footage adds nothing and just makes the film a longer mess.

I had the advantage of  first seeing the film with my own then-seven-year-old blonde superheroine,  and my daughter's expression of sheer delight as Kara skimmed over the lake  and flew with the wild horses reminded me of the thrill I felt 30 years  before when I watched George Reeves hurl himself out of the stockroom  window and into the endlessly repetitive stock footage skies of  Metropolis.

If you think about it the film was made in 1984, naturally it won't be able to compare to todays movies. Considering  the time period in which the film was made it is actually very well done.  The special effects are exeptional and the flying effects are better in  this film (in my opinion) than any of the other Superman films.  I purchased the film last year and the only thing that dissapointed me was  the films picture quality. (Iam refering to the VHS edition) I have seen  the film on television and the picture quality was ten times better, so  obviously the TV version of the film has been heavily edited. The new DVD  edition of the film (which will be realesed in late July) has exeptional  picture and sound quality. I will also add that the new DVD edition has  almost 28 minutes of new additional footage, so the film will be longer and  maybe more interesting.
  So, in conclusion, the film was made 17 years  ago people. In three years it will be considered a classic, if the movie  was realesed in movie theaters today, I could understand why it would be a  horrible film.

About the movie itself: The one thing I really liked  about this movie was how Kara changed into Linda Lee. She didn't need a  phonebooth; I think she just willed her appearance to change. Not only did  her costume become a school uniform, her hair turned brown! That was so  cool.
Although the other characters annoy me so badly, I've watched  this movie countless times because of Ms. Slater's portrayal of Kara... And  get this, I first watched ""Supergirl"" at the movies when I was in  the second grade. That's like fifteen years ago!  I've been a huge fan of  this movie ever since.",949622400,,804,4.527777777777778
422690,5,630200098X,"As I stated above, I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!  This movie came out when I was 7 years old, and I've been looking for it for years ever since.  Helen Slater  was perfectly cast as Supergirl, and man I wish I looked like her.  I will  admit some scenes are kinda cheezy, but overall the movie is one that  should go down as a classic.",940982400,,325,4.0
422691,5,630200098X,"It's not a docu-drama, it's a comic strip! It's supposed to be fun-fantasy and who cares if there's holes in the plot and impossible acts occur? (e.g. wasn't Krypton blown apart years ago when Kal-El/Superman left it as an  infant? Que?? And how did Kara acquire that looks-superb-on-her  super-costume while traveling in her capsule?) Who expects believability  anyway? Enjoy what's there. Helen Slater is a drop-dead gorgeous Supergirl  and plays the fantastical part with dignity and the suitable naivete  expected of an alien visitor. She does a marvelous job with it. And yes,  Faye Dunaway overacts; I would think her part in such a flick required a  large helping of campy emoting as the powerful but somewhat klutzy witch  Selena. A lot of the fun was in the interaction between the quixotic Selena  and her Sancho Panza-like sidekick Bianca (Brenda Vaccaro, herself no  slouch at ironic comedy). Selena constantly pushing her new-found powers  beyond her own abilities to control, landing the two in mess after tangled  mess, accompanied by Bianca's timely snide cynicisms. You'll love Helen  Slater, and you'll love to hate Dunaway & Vaccaro. It's fun. It's  fantasy. Buy it, you'll end up watching it over and over.",934761600,2,1226,5.0954773869346734
