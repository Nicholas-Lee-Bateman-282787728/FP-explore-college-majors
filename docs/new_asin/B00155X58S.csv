8257605,2,B00155X58S,"In showing several segments of this lecture with teens, my opinion is that the OB/GYN speaks too fast and looks to the side as if reading. He has one of the longest parts and he races along with an odd cadence.  The older woman speaks slowly and well and more attention was paid to her and the younger woman speaking about planned parenthood. The Dr. (Urologist)seemed bored with the subject.
There are many other DVD's out there that also show teens speaking about the peer pressure and need for education that had my audience rivited to the screen.  As another reviewer said, this is a lecture on tape. There is no interaction with others, no questions from an audience are answered and even if I was a student interested in the subject, this video was too much information in too short a time, presented in a way that showed no creativity and created no interest.",1306454400,2,866,4.580645161290323
8257606,4,B00155X58S,"Is this DVD perfect? No! Does it cover topics awkward to discuss? YES.  I teach Health at a High School in California and I'm appreciative of this DVD in that it does  cover  sexual topics in a straight forward manner.  It does not have the splashy special effects and camera work that is standard on most science presentations, but the sincere forthright manner of it's presentation is on target for reaching high school age students. My students listen and watch attentively. I would recommend this DVD for a High School Health class.  The organization is such that you can pick and choose the topics you need.",1300406400,12,612,4.735849056603773
8257607,1,B00155X58S,"This video shows a few people talking and talking and talking.  No illustrations just a very masculine woman an effeminate man with a rather large shiny earing and an old black man who talks about menstruation.
The focus seems to be preventing STDs and AIDs and basically encourages your kids to think that ""if it feels good - do it, you're normal, it's all OK""
One intro discussion includes descriptions of the various kinds of very ""normal"" sex as anal, oral and vaginal.  I don't know what other parents were looking for but this DVD was not the ice breaker I was hoping it to be for my young girls.",1286582400,12,602,4.463636363636364
8257608,3,B00155X58S,"I am a health teacher for middle school students and I was looking for materials to supplement my lectures. Unfortunately, this is just lecture on video. We used it a little bit in class just so the kids could see someone else talking about the same stuff but should be used in small doses.

I can see parents liking this video if they want to get caught up on the latest information regarding sexual education or if they are too embarrassed to discuss some of the topics and prefer the ""so, do you have any questions?"" at the end of the segments.

The good thing is that it covers a lot of topics that have come up often in the classroom (and some that the kids don't know how to ask, but should be discussed anyway) so it's nice to see something comprehensive...it's just lacking any kind of interesting visuals for students who are forced to watch it in the first place.",1235433600,22,873,4.382716049382716
8257609,5,B00155X58S,"If you're looking for help in telling your kids about  sex  this is a great DVD! It's fantastic! I
I recommend this as a great supplement to the actual talk parents have with their kids - it's a whole lot less embarrassing!",1212451200,5,223,4.285714285714286
