I learned much that I hadn't known before, although I read or watch anything I can find on these magnificent monitors. Scenes of courting, mating, nest building and guarding, and the behavior of young Komodos are particularly good. I haven't had this film for very long, but I've already viewed it twice; and it's still sitting in my ""to be viewed soon"" pile!",1324080000,,528,4.813186813186813
