8221319,1,B000W6D1IK,129  is way too high for this drama.  Especially since this version is just cheaply made. Just slip covers for the DVDs,1506038400,,119,4.363636363636363
8221320,5,B000W6D1IK,Great show.  Korean version of overboard so it does have some significant differences thebetween the movie but imo funnier.  Delivered on time and good quality.,1434931200,,160,5.36
8221321,5,B000W6D1IK,"Couple or Trouble, Is a S. Korean 16 hour remake of the 112 min American movie Overboard. (goldie hawn, kurt russel).  (check out Overboard on IMDB website)  I found it to be far better than the American version, but again to be fair they had 16 hours to make me laugh.. while the original had just shy of 2 hours.  I have seen this before.  This copy I purchased along with the American version to present to my sister with the deliberate intent to addict her to S. Korean Kdrama's.  A rich spoiled woman's life intersects with a poor laborer's life.  And the sparks fly!  Having seen the shorter American version does not spoil the S. Korean version.  If you can get past the subtitles (after an hour or two they are almost hard to notice.. even tho you are reading them), you may find like i did something more addictive than just about anything else in your life.  Flawless subtitles on this version.  (cheaper prices usually mean poor video.. and even worse subtitles (knockoffs))",1431388800,,985,4.577142857142857
8221322,5,B000W6D1IK,"This Korean Drama is loosely based on the Goldie Hawn/Kurt Rusell movie ""Overboard"". It is more endearing, and more fun than the original. Starring American-born Han Ye-Seul as Anna Jo and Oh Ji-Ho as Jang Chui Soo they make a good romantic couple. Also notable are Kim Sung-Min as the husband Billy, and lovely Park Han-Byul as the ""Flowergirl"". A really fun drama that will make you laugh, and alsio bring tears to your eyes.",1358726400,,427,4.706666666666667
8221323,5,B000W6D1IK,"Oh boy!  This is one of the best.  The version being sold here is terrific.  It's a nice clean set with good resolution, and superior subtitles.  I bought it when it first hit the market, and in fact had pre-ordered it.

I'm a movie junkie, and at the time I purchased this, I was a definite K-Drama fan.  Let's say, I am experienced.

The story has some of the funniest material I've seen around.  The cat/dog exchange enacted to the song, ""Bang Bang He Shot Me Down"", is so hilarious I almost fell off the bed watching it.  I'd seen screen caps of the scene, but nothing compares with live action.

There is a dog in this show who deserves an Oscar.  She's so great.

She's jolly, and good natured.  I read a commentary written by the director describing how easy she was to work with.  She is just a local girl, who could imagine she had star qualities?

He said, when they wanted her to sleep, all they had to do was feed her.  She always crashed after a meal.  Like I said, definite star quality.

There were several cats playing Princess.  They couldn't remember their lines.

Oh Ji Ho is splendid in the opening scene.  He plays it with a straight face for the most part, then with grit and determination later when he's underpaid for the job he's on. (He's a private contractor.)

I can't bring myself to divulge details.  As I mention time and time again, I hate spoilers.

There are scenes in this show involving water, a lot of it.  Put on your life jacket, then sit back and laugh.

There's also a mole of interest, and I don't mean the furry animal.

If I talk too much about this show, I'll just yak for too long.

The cast is grand.  The locale is so perfect (I have tons of pics of it in my computer).  The sets are actual homes and hotels. This show was meticulously filmed down to the last detail.

What a great love story!  Lot's of longing a la K-Drama, lots of tears ditto, and of course a conniving woman you can hate with my blessings.  No, it's not Ana.

There's been mention of the price.  It's not nearly as salty as some, and for sixteen hours, you really can't complain.  It's something you'll watch many times without getting bored.

And ladies, in case you don't know it, Oh Ji Ho is a definite heartthrob with the K-Drama set.  He is very beautiful to look at, and has a really nice voice to listen to.  Plus he always takes off almost all his clothes.  K-Drama ladies wait for that, and discuss it at forums.  Pretty cute.

I have a blog dedicated to Oh Ji Ho.  If interested, see my profile for the link.  This show is highly rated there.  Also, there are photos of the  MBC awards show for this program.

Buy it here.  You'll be happy.",1228348800,5,2669,4.286290322580645

8221328,4,B000W6D1IK,"Super fun soap - very funny and touching. Production value is great.

Enjoyed with subtitles - I am not Korean but had no problem enjoying it anyway!

Too expensive though - Around $100 for the entire series I suppose is not a bad price per episode but would have preferred paying half that price!",1196899200,2,297,4.481481481481482
