8467285,4,B005DOSH1M,"This is a really charming romantic comedy with a twist.  Martina Haag, who also wrote the screenplay, is wonderful in the role of a 40-ish Swedish actress who will do just about anything to make it before it's too late. A resume filled with lies gets her an important role - and then she has to deliver on what she claimed she could do. Meanwhile, she's romanced by a charming but egotistical Danish actor (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau from Game of Thrones) who may or may note love her.

It's a perfect chick flick - a wise Bridget Jones type movie with a plucky heroine who just can't seem to get her life right.  Coster-Waldau brings the ""hot guy"" thing and he's also very funny as the insecure egotist.  Thumbs up!",1425081600,,711,4.488372093023256
