8415206,3,B003IG7NWQ,"Both ""Reef of Riches"" and ""Power of an Ocean"" are solidly good nature shows about equatorial marine life.  On their own, they would merit a 4-star review.

But ""Ocean Voyagers"" is NOT a nature show.  It's a CHILDREN'S STORY about FICTIONAL animal CHARACTERS masquerading as a nature show.  And it's not even an engaging or interesting story either.  It's slow, boring, repetitive, and nothing of consequence ever happens.  Ever.  So, in addition to being nearly worthless educationally, it's also completely worthless even just as mere entertainment.  That's why it drags the star-rating of the whole collection down from four stars to only three.",1365724800,,647,5.213592233009709
