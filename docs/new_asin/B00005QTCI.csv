1649236,3,B00005QTCI,"For those who want to watch a light hearted and funny movie this is the one. Courtney Cox and David Arquett are great on screen together. You can feel their energy. And David James Elliott plays the role of the hansome hunk very well. Especially for those who are David James Elliott fans they will enjoy this movie. A bit of a departure for him from his well known role in the JAG series as the navy lawyer. Courtney's character is loveable and I think everyone can find some identification with her as she goes through the process of overcoming rejection with her past boyfriend. As she looks for the right guy the comedy keeps it light. No box of tissues needed except maybe to wipe away the tears of laughter. I loved Daivd Arquett as he plays the sincere and likeable computer geek turned magazine salesman. His carefree character guickly grows on you and I found myself singing his song ""Let your love grow"" after watching the movie. Carol Kane and her portrayal of the physicologist gone nuts is pure genius. She proves that she does zany really well. I'm glad I purchased the movie used as I would not pay full price for this but I do recommend it for one of those days when you need to watch something light and funny.",1284076800,5,1227,4.457777777777777
1649237,1,B00005QTCI,I can't believe anyone would like this film. It's just bad. David has the charm of a moldy sponge. I would give it less than one star!,1205798400,,134,4.0
1649238,1,B00005QTCI,"Then buy this DVD, otherwise it's just 92 minutes stupid comedy",1139011200,,63,4.818181818181818

1649240,3,B00005QTCI,"This is a silly and sometimes funny film...I like Courtney Cox in ""Scream"" (1996) than here but who's reading this anyways...(...)end",1090627200,,133,5.380952380952381
1649241,5,B00005QTCI,I bought this movie with some suspion that it was not going to be that good because it had been a straight to video movie but I was wrong.  I had great castand story. I laughed constantly throughout the film as cournteny cox got hersel into the craziest situations. A must see and if the R rating turns you off let me tell you there is nothing worse than a PG-13 movie such as 50 first Dates. See and buy movie must!,1088726400,4,416,4.073170731707317

1649263,1,B00005QTCI,"Why oh why did David (James Elliott) agree to make such a moronic film?  It didn't show his acting ability.  He is so much more than a pretty face.  David, get a better agent.",1466467200,,175,4.088235294117647
1649264,3,B00005QTCI,I bought it for one of the stars and that was the best part of the movie. Didn't really care much for the movie!,1433721600,,112,3.7083333333333335

1649266,1,B00005QTCI,"First, the DVD wouldn't work on my TV; I had to watch it on my computer. I liked director Richard Benjamin's Mrs. Winterbourne so I thought I'd try this. Wrong. This was just plain silly and I couldn't finish it.",1412294400,,212,4.325
1649267,4,B00005QTCI,Pretty funny.  It had its' moments.  The plot was pretty good and the actors did a respectable job.  I especially liked the guy from Jag.,1391817600,,137,4.4
1649268,4,B00005QTCI,"This is a cute movie that I enjoyed watching. As a David James Elliott fan, I particularly liked his role in this.",1327622400,,114,4.2272727272727275
1649269,5,B00005QTCI,"A very fun film. If it likes you the series ""Friends"" you  don't have to lose it. To highlight a fast and very intelligent screenplay. And very well interpreted, Highlighting the interpretation of David James Elliott.",1323734400,,217,5.027777777777778
1649270,3,B00005QTCI,"I usually don't like romantic comedies,I only watched it because of David Arquette but (He's adorable in this.)this turned out to be a decent movie. I just wish David Arquette had a bigger role in. I don't think David had to do much acting as you truly can see the real love and affection in his eyes that he has for Courtney Cox. Worth a watch especially if your a David Arquette fan.",1322784000,,385,4.287671232876712
1649271,4,B00005QTCI,"I thought it was cute and it held my attention. Courteney is very good with the goofy, ""FRIENDS"" type of comedy.  It was kind of odd watching it knowing what's going on with Cox and Arquette at this time.  David seemed to be playing himself (though I don't know him personally), a cute goof with a heart of gold.  I'm not sure why some people gave this 1 star?  I've seen MUCH worse movies than this!  They must have incredibly high standards.  I was entertained and laughed out loud quite a few times.",1288051200,,502,4.344086021505376

7950874,2,B00005QTCI,"This movie was so bad I literally fast forwarded through it to the scenes with David James Elliott, which was the only reason I watched it in the first place.  The only good this movie has to offer is to remind us just how sexy DJE is.  This wasn't a movie that showed his acting chops though, or anyone else's for that matter.  Too many people with too many issues and nothing to balance out the crazy.",1494288000,,403,4.207792207792208
7950875,5,B00005QTCI,"This is a fun, really feel-good movie, maybe more of a chick flick - I'm so glad I watched it! Good acting, &  interesting script. Bonus surprise - to see Viola Davis in an early, (supporting), role in her acting career.",1490659200,2,220,4.365853658536586
7950876,1,B00005QTCI,"I'm always up for a comedy, romance, a combo of the two--this movie was awful from the start.  The writing is B grade, Courtney Cox acts like she's Monika from Friends on medication that's making her behave insanely, but as soon as she gets a look at the new neighbour, she seems to switch to Monika off the meds.  I couldn't watch past the first 20 minutes--and while this was 20 minutes of my life I won't get back (though thank G-d for multi-tasking while watching), I'm pleased that at least I didn't pay to watch this piece of trash.",1489622400,2,538,4.37
