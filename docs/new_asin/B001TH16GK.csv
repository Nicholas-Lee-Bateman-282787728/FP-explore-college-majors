8341392,4,B001TH16GK,"A casino owner, Phil, carries on a love affair with, Lela, the headline singer, while carrying on with a chorus girl. Lela gets fed up and runs away with a drunken millionaire whom she marries. Phil seeks revenge while Lela tries to steady a rocky marriage. This is a surprisingly engaging film with plot twists and suspense. Plenty of beauty, lots of PreCode partying, and an overabundance of violent emotions. This is a dynamic film and well worth watching.",1523750400,,459,4.822784810126582
