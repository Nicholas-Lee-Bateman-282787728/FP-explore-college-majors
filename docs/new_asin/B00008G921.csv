7983725,3,B00008G921,"I agree with the previous review, and also generously grant it 3 stars. The kid in question acts more like a moron than someone with a purpose in his visit to Buenos Aires - and it's not necesarily to meet Sabrina Love, the porn star he won a night of ""fun"" with. As with the typical Argentine movie, the inevitable old Italian man is there, this time, as unexplicably the husband of Sabrina Love, who is the producer of her show, and is of the jealous type, but has money. The boy gets to mee SL, and have a night of fun with her. he also gets to know her on a deeper level, but cannot, or will not grow up. The movie gets even more irritating as he fails to share with his city older brother, the real news about their parents. The film had a promising start, but as with the rest of Argentina, it was all a terrible waste.",1213660800,,825,4.098765432098766

The story is very interesting  and it is about a boy who, after winning a contest, must make his way to Buenos Aires to meet the famous porn star Sabrina Love. He learns things about himself and others during his journey. Although the story was very interesting, the execution of the film failed in that the movie became tedious, not well edited and a bit boring. Even Cecilia Roth could not save this movie. Her performance, although not her best, is so much better than the movie. In conclusion, it is not a bad film, but it could have been better had the plot held together better and had better editting.",1203379200,,720,4.4961832061068705
