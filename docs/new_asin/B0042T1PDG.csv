A few years ago one of the Author was a guest on ""Martha Stewart Show"". It is  a must see documentary for the Art Deco admirers.",1389139200,,300,3.761904761904762
8413932,4,B0042T1PDG,"Very well done video.  Contains brief history of the region with original footage.  It is sympathetic to the rebels who wanted Eritrea broken off from Ethiopia.  The video mentions little about the significant conflict in this long struggle.  It shows excellent images of the country including the city of Asmara.  Nice footage of prized Italian architecture as well as some rare inside-the-building shots.  There is no mention of Kagnew Station, the USA's military post on the edges of Asmara.  Kagnew was home to many soldiers and sailors in the 1950s through mid 1970s, and was a major contributor to the area's economy.  For those wishing to get a good overview of the country, its scenic mountains and urban centers, this video will certainly do.",1327190400,,751,5.0
8413933,5,B0042T1PDG,There is something about this beautiful small country in East Africa the mainstream media is not telling us.  I don't know if it is envy or ignorance but Eritrea is perhaps one of the most wonderful places to visit on earth.  I am planning to take my son next year and I am sure it will be a lot of fun,1302652800,,302,3.9344262295081966
8413934,4,B0042T1PDG,"The small country of Eritrea, near the ""Horn of Africa,"" has quite a story to tell.  My mother was born in the capital city of Asmara during the Italian colonial period during WWII, so this country is of special significance to our family.  In the last century, Eritrea had been dominated by Italy, Britain, and Ethiopia, but finally won their independence after nearly 30 years of ""civil war"" with Ethiopia.

The Eritrean people are a proud people for good reason and are very resourceful, well-organized, and resilient.  They won back their independence against a much larger and better financed foe without any help from the rest of the world.

This documentary DVD is very informative - giving the broad historical picture while including enough details to make the viewer feel like they have had the pleasure of visiting Eritrea in person.  My only regret is that the documentary is only around one hour long.  Eritrea's history and current situation is rich enough to easily provide an additional hour of footage (my opinion).",1296432000,,1032,4.965116279069767
8413935,5,B0042T1PDG,"This video about Eritrea's mesmerizing. It tells the history of the brave and proud Eritrean people and shows you the amazing landscape and architecture of the country and particularly the capital city of Asmara which's considered the most clean and beautiful city in the whole continent of Africa. I wish there was more videos like this that exposes the beautiful people of Eritrea with their bravery, culture, hospitality that would introduces them to the World. This video will do some of it. I highly recommend this video to whoever is interested in the nation of Eritrea or in international architecture. The cinematography's stunning!",1295568000,,640,5.223300970873787
8413936,5,B0042T1PDG,"This was a beautifully-filmed documentary!  I knew practically nothing about Eritrea but now I feel like I've been there.  How interesting that there's a country like this in Africa, and the rest of the world knows nothing about it.  Highly recommended.",1287360000,2,253,5.121951219512195
8413937,5,B0042T1PDG,"Before watching this film all I really knew about Eritrea was its long running conflict with Ethiopia, beyond that there didn't seem to be much more of interest. However this documentary showed me how wrong I was.

This film is packed with surprises, from the futuristic architecture of its beautiful capital (Mussolini liked his cinemas so they built five of them) to the country's innovative school health programmes. The school health programme interestingly draws upon the experiences of the underground schools created during the civil war by integrating health checks into each school which means they are able to treat more kids more cost-effectively.

I generally have a very short attention span for these sorts of films but the story of this small country kept me gripped.",1286668800,4,782,5.149606299212598
