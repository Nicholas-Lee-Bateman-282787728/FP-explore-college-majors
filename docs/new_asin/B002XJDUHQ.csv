8383718,3,B002XJDUHQ,"This is the 3rd Leslie Sansone DVD purchased but not my favorite.  I got a good enough workout, but the camera work isn't the greatest.  I liked working with the bands but wish she had a group with her.  The Bonus Mile seemed to just stop during the stretching section.",1316649600,,269,4.34
8383719,4,B002XJDUHQ,"I have used other Leslie Sansone walking videos but this one gives you a totally different workout.

This comes with 2 therapy bands - different strengths to use during the middle of your workout.  You do lunges,squats and arm exercises along with your walking.  You definitely feel the burn in this one.

Good video!",1297641600,,317,4.814814814814815

8383721,5,B002XJDUHQ,This is my sixth or seventh Leslie Sansone DVD and my new favorite!  It combines cardio with strength training to make me feel good physically and good about doing what's good for me and having fun at it.,1268524800,5,204,4.368421052631579
8383722,4,B002XJDUHQ,"As I remember, this video is a good one.  I loved the stretchies. You just can't have too many stretchies. The video is a good workout.
I'd be more detailed, except I seem to have misplaced it at the moment. Can't pop it in to refresh my memory. But I do recall that I was happy with this workout.",1267833600,2,297,4.033898305084746
8383723,5,B002XJDUHQ,I walked away 35 pounds with Leslie and was in the best shape of my life...but I stopped and need to do it again,1264809600,5,112,3.7083333333333335
