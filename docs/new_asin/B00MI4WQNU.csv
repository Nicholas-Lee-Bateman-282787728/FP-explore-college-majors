6578689,5,B00MI4WQNU,"This is a mostly excellent program covering the only American to ever win the Tour De France and his battle with previous winner/legend Bernard Hinault. I remember watching in 85 when LeMond nearly in tears was asked to ""stand down"" and not try to win to support Hinault winning his 5th Championship. I was confused as to why an athlete that seemingly could win would be asked to sacrifice himself for another athlete.  The next year I watched with high expectations that LeMond would prove too strong to be defeated.  Well, little did I know at the time all the scheming that was going on to get Mr Hinault number 6 and keep LeMond down.  This program is a great reminder of a great athlete and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  The bonus interview footage is also nice to have.  In it LeMond talks about Lance Armstrong a bit more than they needed in the program and also goes through some of his old jerseys.  Hinault also admits to messing with Greg in '86 with his comments (he's a jerk) and there is more.  I would add that although Amazon.com doesn't mention it ... my copy is a DVDR.",1411516800,11,1083,4.4393939393939394

6578693,5,B00MI4WQNU,"This is an excellent documentary on cycling and the Tour de France in the 1980s. Its about the competition between Bernard Hinault and Greg LeMond. Like many sports, the tour is both a competition between teams and within teams. They are constantly fighting to have their team win and to at the same time preserve their ""spot"" within the team. Fighting for the spot isn't just about being the best on the road, its also about commercial considerations for the teams, the sponsors and the event.

LeMond was on the rise and legend Bernard Hinault had peaked out. LeMond was asked to stand down and allow Hinault to win. Promises were made to LeMond that if he did the right thing, Hinault would ""pass the torch"" to him the next year and help him win. LeMond did the difficult but honorable thing and stood down allow Hinault to win.

But a year later, LeMond found out that none of these people were honorable. Hinault comes across as the prototypical French egomaniac and the athlete who doesn't realize that its over. The team coach comes across even worse as a total snake. The best part is probably when the competition gets so heated that the tour officials warn LeMond to be very careful of anything he eats or drinks.

Its a good documentary about how the tour used to be before the big money came in and it became a global event rather than a French event. Its good at showing how rough life on the tour was in that era.

The ""DVD"" contains extra interviews and pieces of interviews that cover issues that were not really the subject of the documentary (like Lance Armstrong).",1470614400,2,1583,4.563380281690141

Lemond on the verge of winning the hardest test of physical athletics being restricted to let the legendary Hinault win his 5th and possibly record setting 6th Tour.

6578709,5,B00MI4WQNU,"ESPN Films 30 for 30: Slaying the Badger is an absorbing documentary about Greg LeMond and Bernard Hinault during the 1986 Tour de France.

To me, Greg Lemond had always been a mythical name in the lore of cycling because he was the only American who won the Tour de France. I started watching the tours every July since OLN (or Versus or whatever the hell it is now, that hockey channel, you know what I mean) began covering it extensively; the height of its popularity began when Lance Armstrong started to win consecutively. Then, there was a lot of mudslinging going on, tarnishing Greg LeMond's image. To be honest with you, I didn't know what to think since I had no facts. Towards the end of Lance's run, the din of the banging drum had been getting louder and louder that Lance cheated. It sounded inconceivable because I saw most of the tours for years and was impressed with his feats. To the surprise of everyone, the cat came out of the bag, and it turned out to be the greatest sporting fraud ever. Finally, Greg's name and legacy had been restored.

Watching ESPN Films 30 for 30: Slaying the Badger, I now have more respect for Greg LeMond, and he has really done it without cheating, an amazing feat given the state of Tour de Farce, an event that I refuse to watch anymore. The story between the two is interesting to listen to, and there is a clash of personalities between LeMond and Hinault. I've ended up learning a lot about what had happened.

All in all, ESPN Films 30 for 30: Slaying the Badger is a must-see.",1425340800,6,1534,4.451957295373665

The characters are awesome, as we all have a bit of revisionists in us.  Andy Hampsten kind of blows it away with his sideline commentary about the tension.

8672457,5,B00MI4WQNU,"Lemond remains a true American Hero.  The Tour is so hard and the elements of chance, timing and training understandably tempt one to cheat.  While Lance Armstrong was in fact a great athlete his moral failure was in lying to the public and in not acknowledging gratitude for a near miraculous cure from his malignancy.  Greg and Cathy Lemond are straight up...what you see is what they are.  Hinault was also a great athlete perhaps closer to Eddy Merckx than any other rider ever but has that shifty eye and worldly wit that is ever ready to feint and then attack when you don't expect it.  Andy Hampsten's interview is most revealing and his humility is impressive.  Professional cycling will always be a gritty and wonderful sport but the price the riders pay is too high.",1522022400,,776,4.669117647058823

8672462,5,B00MI4WQNU,"I had seen this production years ago, so when I recently saw it available on DVD I was happy to purchase it. Lance Armstrong did tremendous damage to Greg LeMond's reputation and business interests, including Greg LeMond bicycles, when he lambasted Greg for rightly saying that Armstrong had been doping. This was early-on during Armstrong's string of Tour de France ""victories."" Greg remained a vociferous critic of Armstrong despite what it cost him personally. Eventually, Lance Armstrong admitted he cheated proving Greg had been right all along.

This video is a great re-telling of the story of probably the greatest genuine cycling talent to come out of the USA, ever. I also had an opportunity to ride a Greg LeMond bicycle in 2004, for several hours. To this day, it is still one of the finest production bicycles I have ever ridden. I am still kicking myself for not having bought it.

Greg LeMond is a hero on many levels. This is his story.",1492819200,2,952,4.798780487804878
