8229314,5,B000XS421M,"This is a very good course. I would say that the title is misleading in that it isn't about ""classical guitar"" but about ""fingerstyle"" guitar. These are well known and loved traditional songs broken down into very interesting arraignments . What I liked the most is that Mr. Hand was comfortable explaining ""the why"" of his musical decisions which you can then apply to your own playing. His explanations and focus on the left hand, fingering choices and neck positions make this a fun video for the advancing player. I think players with at least bar chords under their control (or the notes of the 6th / 1st and 2nd strings) can also get something out of this. They should understand there will be a lot of rewinding but they will grow quickly. In short this was more than just learning four folk songs in flowering finger style - you're given a personal musical tour.",1500595200,,870,4.619354838709677
8229315,2,B000XS421M,Not a quality DVD. Pass on this one. Quality Control was not present. Good subject matter.,1423267200,,90,4.6875
8229316,5,B000XS421M,Fredrick Hand is a very top end classical guitarist.  These arrangements are not easy and don't even try them unless you have at least intermediate/advanced nylon string guitar skills.  If you do there are some great arrangements here to add to your repertoire.,1422230400,,261,5.046511627906977
8229317,5,B000XS421M,"This DVD came a few second before I go out, So I played in car audio during my trip.
Amazing...the opening piece is very beutiful, reminding me ""To Look for America/Oh Shenandoah composed by Checkfield"".
Hand taught very detail and more patient... I think as a teacher he is one of the best. Very recommended for everyone who's like the folk and classical music at any level.",1294704000,,375,4.611940298507463
8229318,5,B000XS421M,"Having purchased Frederic Hand's previous two DVD's , which were both strictly on classical technique and repertoire, I thought that I would see how he would put all that knowledge to Folk song arrangements.
Wow, this Dvd is yet another absolute Gem. Great Teacher, Great arrangements,What more can you say but thankyou Fred.",1222819200,2,325,5.150943396226415
