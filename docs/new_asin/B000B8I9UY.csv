The new ""team"" has trouble trusting who is who and what actions to take.  Do they trust the Gantz? or do they trust Kurono.",1132185600,,351,4.223880597014926
8083368,5,B000B8I9UY,"Game 4 begins on this dvd and it does not seem as dramatic as game 3. I gave it 5 stars out of respect after the shocking ending of ep22, but I really wanted to give it 4 stars after the shocking ending ep21.

Episode 21. Out of the group of players you seen at the begining of game 3, there are only 5 players left to fight the last 2 aliens.  Gantz shocking ending= Only one survivor of game 3.

Episode 22. A brand new cast, but who cares I lost my fav characters lol. The alien of Game 4 is shown at the very end of the episode AND YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE WHAT THEY HAVE TO FACE!!!

Episode 23 The new cast battles the new alien(snickers) nothing that special yet but the preview shows you that have to get the next volume.

Thats all i can tell you without ruining the dvd for you.",1132012800,3,783,3.961783439490446
