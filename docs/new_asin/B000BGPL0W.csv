On the other hand, for a fraction of the price of a private lesson, you get to see Gary demo demonstrate the right way to produce tones. Be advised that Amazon lists the exact same disc for $10 less elsewhere.",1356739200,,453,4.9605263157894735
8086444,1,B000BGPL0W,"This entire Homespun series is totally bogus, in my opinion.  I have tried two, and both were poorly produced.  They give the impression that they just set up a camera, then let the artist ramble on with little forethought or scripting.

In this case, I have to assume that Peacock is a good musician, but he is a marginal teacher and speaker at best.. little eye contact, lots of mumbling, and even several of his playing examples are not what I would expect from a supposedly top-notch player.

My advice... avoid Homespun videos like the plague, and invest your money in a good instructional book instead!",1150934400,6,608,4.7075471698113205
