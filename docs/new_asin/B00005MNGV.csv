8221492,4,B00005MNGV,"This DVD was originally released as a video in 1988. I mainly bought it for the ""Making of Caligula"" featurette, and didn't really have high hopes for the rest of this video, as it was made in the mid 80's; the music, the hairstyles, and the lower body hair. However, it was a very refreshing surprise. It is pretty safe, lots of[..], very little shown down below, but still very erotic and tasteful. It is dated, like I said, the music, clothing and hair, but what the heck, it's not bad, and definately worth the price. The best bit is ""Punk  or Bust"" which features a nice lesbian scene between Julia Barton and Michelle Bauer. This bit uses music similiar to Caligula, and the scene is set up very much like the tryst between Anneka and Lori. The Caligula featurette is very good. Much better editing than the hour long documentary version found on the Blue Caligula DVD. On the Wild Side features 7 very hot women; Janie Blevins, Corina Ragnarrson, Rhonda Vandegriff, Julia Barton, Michelle Bauer, Colleen Applegate and Alexandra Day. Don't forget to get your copy of the Blue Caligula DVD.",1168473600,2,1095,4.6735751295336785
