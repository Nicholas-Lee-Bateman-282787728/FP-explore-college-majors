8501285,3,B006N8GNU4,"My nearly-two year old son loves the Thomas episode collections. This isn't one of our favorites, I think because we have some issues with the content of the stories. They're kind of boring. My son does seem to like the episode with Dash's warbling whistle, but Emily is a bit of a brat so it kind of overshadows Dash's neat whistling.

This DVD includes:
Up, Up and Away- Thomas and Percy are asked to bring huge, pre-inflated balloons across the island to Mr. Bubbles' Big Balloon Show. Thomas doesn't think the route Percy wants to take is the best route, but he doesn't want to hurt Percy's feelings by saying so. After they lose a few balloons, he finally says something to Percy. A good lesson in how to voice disagreement in a kind way. (Hubby and I are STILL not sure why these balloons are pre-inflated. Wouldn't it be easier for Mr. Bubbles to inflate the balloon at the show?!?)

Wonky Whistle- Thomas' whistle ""is clearly wonky,"" and needs to be repaired. Sir Topham Hatt asks him to tell all of the engines to come to the country show. While his whistle is being replaced, with mechanics climbing over him to do the work, Thomas drives off (nearly knocking one man off a ladder- dangerous!). He drives around the island, blowing his wonky whistle and telling everyone about the show. But they only hear his whistle, and try to tell him it's wonky; no one hears his message.

Kevin the Steamie- Kevin tries to play ""Biff, Bash, Bosh"" with Thomas and Percy, but it's tough with his hook instead of buffers. He promises to practice throughout the day, but ends up making a mess of the Steamworks and having to fix everything. When Thomas and Percy arrive to play, Kevin tells them he's no better. They decide that another game, ""Hide and Peep"" is much more fun to play, especially with Kevin's hook!

Emily & Dash- Dash is a special guest for the Children's Steam Fair, where Sir Topham Hatt has asked him to demonstrate his warbling whistle. As Emily escorts him to the fair, she tells him she can master the trick effortlessly. Dash tells her it takes a long time to learn, and she asks him over and over to teach her. Dash is hesitant, as the process uses alot of fuel and they have a long way to travel, but Emily assures him he won't run out of fuel. He DOES run out of fuel and Emily decides she'll take his place at the fair. But when she arrives, she learns she hasn't mastered warbling just yet and decides to bring Dash fuel so he can perform for the children.

Mr. Perkins Clips- Mr. Perkins has grown some carrots for the Sodor Fruit and Vegetable show. He continues to nurture them as the time for the show approaches and also teaches the viewer how to plant their own carrots.",1413504000,,2700,4.468559837728194

8501289,5,B006N8GNU4,"Another review explains everything on the DVD.  I just wanted to add this is an animated DVD, not a narrated one.  Thomas and friends actually do the talking in the videos, not just narration.  My 2 1/2 yr old has watched the short segments over and over.  There are only 4, but he still loves them.  Worth the price.",1344211200,2,317,4.305084745762712

My boys (3 and 5) love Thomas and this DVD was a hit for them.  They loved the story lines which included a fair and balloons!  Wholesome lessons of friendship and working together, perfect for preschoolers!",1332288000,,323,4.631578947368421
8501291,4,B006N8GNU4,"Between segments features Driver Perkins preparing for the fruit and vegetable show. He is quite excited about the carrots he is growing and even plays music for them.  He's tempted to dig them up early to see how big they are.  Will he win?

Up, Up &  Away
Thomas and Percy are assigned to transport the big balloon to the Sodor circus.  Thomas wanted to take the old woodland track because its quieter, but Percy was worried something would pop it.  The first track they take they ended up losing the balloon as it floated away! Then they had the clown blow up another one, but it got stuck in a tunnel and had to be popped. They asked the clown to blow up one final balloon and took the woodland track, making it safely!

Wonky Whistle
It's the day of the Country Show and Thomas needs to spread the word and deliver the animals. Thomas's whistle broke and was having it repaired, but he was in a hurry to take care of his special delivery for the Country Show despite warnings of having a wonky whistle because it wasn't fitted properly.  His whistle kept scaring the animals out of the trailer he was hauling. Thomas was in too much of a hurry to pay attention to others trying to tell him.  When he arrives, no one is there and all the animals are missing! He must find them and tell the people about the show.

Kevin the Steamie
Thomas and Percy were just washed and Kevin was in charge of the Steamworks. Thomas accidentally bumped into a flatbed with oil drums that biffed Percy. They decided to play biff bash bosh back and forth. Kevin wanted to play too but he didn't have buffers like the trains since he was a vehicle. While playing, the flatbed was knocked over. Kevin went around hitting the fallen oil drums, knocking them into other engines, scratching them up.  He was trying to practice the game, but instead was upsetting the trains.  After he helped everyone get right again, Thomas found a game that Kevin was better at than him - hide and peep!  Kevin's hook made him really good at hiding objects for Thomas and Percy to find.

Emily and Dash
It's the day of the Children's Steam Fair and Sir Topham Hatt wants Dash to be the train for day.  He asked Emily to take Dash there.  The logging trains could twitter and tweet with their whistles. Emily tried to learn as she took Dash to the fair. Dash said it takes a long time to learn how to do and uses extra fuel so to be careful practicing. Dash became worried that he would run out of fuel from showing Emily how, but she kept insisting that he show her over and over because she couldn't do it.  Dash does run out of fuel.  Can Emily get him to the fair in time?

While I don't like clowns, this set of shows was fun and upbeat.  There were good messages about being patient, getting the job done right instead of rushing through it, and about appreciating unique skills.  My favorite episode was with Kevin.  He was trying to hard to be like Thomas, but instead Thomas found something unique about him to make him feel better about himself - the way friends do!  With Up, Up & Away, I think it showed how sometimes our initial thought is often the best solution, even if we have to take a longer, slower path.
