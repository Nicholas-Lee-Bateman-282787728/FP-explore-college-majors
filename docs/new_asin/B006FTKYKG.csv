4985344,5,B006FTKYKG,"My 2 year old loves watching Curious George on pbs while at home.  We must have several dozen episodes recorded.  Now when we go on road trips, we are able to watch Curious George thanks to the dvds.  They are the same episodes you watch on tv. Each DVD contains 8 shows totaling over 90 minutes of pure entertainment for our child to watch.",1355270400,,341,4.296875
4985345,5,B006FTKYKG,"My son is a huge Curious George fan at the age of 2, and this is his favorite Curious George Video... a huge hit!",1347926400,,113,3.75
4985346,5,B006FTKYKG,"OK, I admit it: my husband and I love the Curious George episodes almost as much as our kids do. Our boys are ages 3 and 5 and we are so thankful that they love Curious George instead of the other junk targeted for kids. I bought this DVD last week because our boys were very sick and it literally saved the week. They were both bed-ridden and they haven't wanted to watch anything else besides this DVD, not even the other 10+ Curious George DVDs we own. As much as I hate them watching more than an hour of TV each day, I'm OK with it when they're this sick (and it's Curious George). It's their favorite and ours, too. We love the comedy (the firefighters just crack me up) and they boys seem to have taken more of the science lessons from this DVD than others. We LOVED learning how to make a metal detector and our boys have been doing gymnastics like crazy around our house.

As a childcare provider and preschool teacher, ALL of my kids prefer Curious George to any other show we own. On the rare occasions they get to watch TV, Curious George is one I don't mind putting on for 10 minutes, knowing that they're learning and laughing. The characters are all so perfect and endearering (Bill's my favorite, next to George, of couse). Our boys LOVE the Curious George books, too!

This DVD feautures 8 new episodes: Curious George Rescue Monkey, Curious George and the One That Got Away, The Clean, Perfect Yellow Hat, George Buys a Kite, Metal Detective, Jungle Gym, Gnocchi the Critic, and Train of Light. This is a must for any Curious George fan and one that would be perfect if you're just starting your collection. I hope this helps. :)",1329609600,31,1647,4.4144736842105265
