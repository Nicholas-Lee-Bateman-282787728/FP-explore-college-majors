8617297,5,B00FNPPUUC,The shows keep you guessing. It depicts a realistic view of a French industrial city. I also like the contrast between the two main characters.,1502841600,,143,4.76
8617298,2,B00FNPPUUC,"Disappointing series.  Normally I like series made in France but the stories are a little too gritty for my taste.  The heroes are not very
likeable.  There is not much to enjoy in the way of scenery.  Detective Montalbano is far superior to this series.",1440720000,,254,4.5777777777777775
8617299,3,B00FNPPUUC,"Rather disappointing - the acting is a little ""self-conscious!!"" I expect better from a French production - however, not absolutely unwatchable.",1428969600,,144,5.904761904761905
8617300,3,B00FNPPUUC,"It's OK just about sums it up. I can't see the rationale behind moving the whole story lock-stock-and-barrel from Portsmouth to Le Harvre. Did the French TV company do some market research and discover that a French audience wouldn't watch a series set across the Channel? The problem is that some of the characters -- like the main villain -- fit naturally into the Portsmouth setting and seem out of place in France. Even the names sound ""odd"". The detective is still called ""Faraday"" for example... I wasn't convinced. It's time some enterprising English company took up the challenge of these books. It would be well worth it...",1412121600,,632,4.861111111111111

Great character acting interest story line and plot well acted",1404259200,,99,4.882352941176471
8617302,3,B00FNPPUUC,"I have always enjoyed the novels of Graham Hurley and had wished they would be made into a UK TV series.  It is somewhat strange seeing them moved to Le Havre and the characters moved as well, given very similar names.  Although competently made, the series lacks a little spark, possibly because the script and the characters try too hard to stick closely to events/people which could only really happen in England.

I doubt whether ratings will be spectacular for this series, which I would summarize with that terrible word: ""Average""",1398470400,4,537,4.8791208791208796
8617303,5,B00FNPPUUC,"Yes, I be leave that Mr. Jean Marc Barr has found his calling. Great story line's, sharp digital film work not bad for French T.V.",1390176000,2,130,4.24
8617304,5,B00FNPPUUC,"Excellent in everything that matters. Acting. direction. Story. Production. All very VERY good to
excellent. Hard to see how it could have been better.",1389744000,4,151,5.333333333333333
