SERIES SYNOPSES:

BEULAH-- Radio and TV program about an African-American cook/housekeeper was a television contemporary of ""Amos 'n Andy."" Both shows were criticized for racial stereotyping yet ""Beulah"" was never boycotted the way ""Amos.."" was. A total of 87 installments appeared on ABC from 10/3/50 to 12/23/52. Cast included Ethel Waters (Beulah), Dooley Wilson (""Sam"" in Casablanca) and Butterfly McQueen (""Gone With the Wind"").

DUFFY'S TAVERN-- Ed Gardner played Brooklynite ""Archie"" on both radio and TV in this precursor to Jackie Gleason's ""Joe the Bartender"" sketches and ""Archie Bunker's Place."" Also appearing as the popular ""Finnegan"" was Alan Reed (aka Fred Flintstone). ""Duffy's"" was produced by Hal Roach Studios. A total of 39 syndicated episodes were broadcast, beginning 1/6/54.

GEORGE BURNS & GRACIE ALLEN SHOW-- The long-running radio classic came to CBS-TV 10/12/50 for eight seasons, ending only due to Gracie's failing health. George and zany Gracie's next door neighbors were Blanche and Harry Morton. Situations usually revolved around these four characters.

THE JACK BENNY PROGRAM-- Benny's popular self-titled sit-com aired on radio and TV for over 30 years with few cast changes. His televison show often recycled radio scripts and featured almost every movie, radio and TV celebrity of that era. Cast included Jack's wife Mary Livingstone, Eddie Anderson (""Rochester""), singer Dennis Day and announcer Don Wilson.

JACKSON AND JILL-- A now-obscure series that ran four seasons, starting in 1949. Starred Todd Karns and Helen Chapman.

LIFE WITH ELIZABETH-- A gentle domestic sit-com that starred Betty White. Elizabeth and husband Alvin were the ""parents"" of a 185-lb. St Bernard and a little Pekinese dog. A total of 145 syndicated chapters aired between 10/7/53 and 9/1/55.

LOVE THAT BOB-- Syndicated title of ""The Bob Cummings Show."" Fashion fotog/playboy lives with sister ""Margaret"" (Rosemary DeCamp) and nephew ""Chuck"" (Dwayne Hickman). ""Schultzy"" (Ann B. Davis) is his lovestruck office girl. Bob is also pursued by ""Pamela"" (Nancy Kulp- Jane Hathaway on The Beverly Hillbillies). Aired 4 seasons and was an early network jumper.

THE PEOPLE'S CHOICE-- The real star of this Jackie Cooper sitcom was Cleo the talking bassett hound. Premise: City councilman and ornithologist Socrates Miller (Cooper) secretly weds the daughter of Mayor Peoples (thus the series name). The couple tries to hide the marriage from her father. Show aired three seasons and 104 episodes on NBC-TV, beginning Oct. '56.

TROUBLE WITH FATHER-- Humorous tales of a high school principal (Stu Erwin), his wife and two daughters. Ran for 130 episodes and 4 seasons on ABC-TV, from 10/21/50 to 4/13/55.
