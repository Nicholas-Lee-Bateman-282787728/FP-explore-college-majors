8440792,3,B004TP5606,"Two great movies put on one blu-ray minus the special features like director's commentary....I'd stick with the full disc - James Grey commentary on YARDS is exemplary and should not be missed.  This is a missed opportunity - they should've put two James Grey movies together on TWO DISCS - I think this is ok - but a little shoddy - but my grade on THE YARDS itself?  B +

8440794,4,B004TP5606,"Judge Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict -- ""I'm a fan of double-features, themed movie nights, movie marathons, and so on. I've always taken joy in finding an intriguing batch or two or three films and watching them back-to-back. Unfortunately, there's generally little thought put into double-features released on DVD or Blu-ray. However, Echo Bridge's pairing of James Gray's The Yards and Scott Frank's The Lookout is an exception. James Gray's The Yards is an immensely respectable film in a variety of ways: it boasts sturdy, occasionally artful direction, solid performances from an impressive mix of younger (Mark Wahlberg, Joaquin Phoenix, Charlize Theron) and older actors (Faye Dunaway, James Caan, Ellen Burstyn), handsome cinematography from Harris Savides, an impressively nuanced Howard Shore score and a screenplay pitched squarely at thoughtful grown-ups. And yet, something about it leaves me a bit cold. Perhaps it's the film's overbearingly grim tone, which drapes the entire affair in an air of Greek tragedy (when certain characters meet their fate, it feels predestined rather than surprising). It's fascinating to watch The Lookout directly after The Yards, as the former's seemingly effortless ability to accomplish its goals makes the latter look laborious in comparison. The Yards works so hard to make an emotional impact, but doesn't quite get there. Meanwhile, The Lookout tells a similar story with vastly more humor, a shorter running time and a generally lighter tone yet somehow also manages to pack the emotional wallop The Yards was striving for. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character may initially inspire memories of Guy Pearce's turn in Memento, but Gordon-Levitt's performance is so persuasive and three-dimensional that Chris quickly turns into a unique cinematic figure. The crime sequences are well-executed and the plot twists are surprising enough, but it's the character work that really impresses. The Lookout did a belly-flop at the box office, but it remains one of the more satisfying crime movies of recent years. The downside to this release is that both films have been packed onto a single disc, sans special features of any sort. The Yards receives particularly poor marks for its weak transfer, looking a good 10 or 20 years older than it actually is. Black levels aren't what they should be, detail is lacking, and there are even a few scratches and flecks. As with the initial release, the film has been cropped from 2.39:1 to 1.78:1, which is inexcusable. The Lookout is considerably stronger, boasting a transfer with impressive depth and detail. The film has a naturally grainy, slightly desaturated look, so don't mistake the filmmaker's artistic intentions for a poor transfer. Audio is less problematic on both releases, though The Lookout is again the stronger of the two. The Yards seems a tad muted on occasion, and there isn't enough balance between the incredibly loud club scenes and the quieter dialogue scenes. Meanwhile, The Lookout successfully finds a balance between the vigorous James Newton Howard score, sturdy sound design and crisp, clean dialogue.""",1310774400,3,3117,5.337398373983739
