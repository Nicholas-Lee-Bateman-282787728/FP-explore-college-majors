2397348,1,B000AYEL60,"I bought this collection expecting to see season and championship highlights of the FORTY NINERS, not other teams. None of the season highlights have been about San Francisco. The team was only included in the Super Bowl highlights, which was minimal. I am not at all impressed with a collection that should focus solely on the Forty Niners and their road to five Super Bowl victories, but barely has any actual highlights of them. I would not waste your money... you could see the same Super Bowl highlights on Hulu.",1326499200,4,517,4.7555555555555555
2397349,1,B000AYEL60,"This is the worst compilation I have ever seen, besides the fact that the Niners won 5 Superbowls. There are more highlights of other teams than the Niners. What happens to all the Niners' highlights? You would think they would include highlights of each of their season leading up to the Superbowl.

Pro: You cannot change history. The Niners went to five and won all five Superbowls.
Cons: Poor picture quality (like it came from the 70's), confusing highlights back and forth of other teams, poor narrating. Just a very poor compilation without proper transition and cohesiveness.

You should skip this and spend $24 and buy ""America Game Superbowl Champions - Forty Niners"". You will enjoy that series a lot more. Nothing but Niners highlights, superb picture quality, and narrated by ex-players themselves with their actual stories and experience with each of their Superbowl season.

2397350,2,B000AYEL60,"This DVD was underimpressive.  It recounted the regular seasons of teams that didn't make the playoffs but not for the 49ers.  The coverage for the 1981 season and playoffs was especially lackluster.  The only real decent part of the DVD was the coverage of the actual superbowls.  That part was in depth.  Also, the cover blurb is a bit misleading in that I thought there was going to be actual game footage with announcers and everything.  All it had was highlights and a narrator.",1193097600,3,483,4.690476190476191
2397351,4,B000AYEL60,"If you love football strategy, good passing game then watching any highlights of the 80's and early 90's San Francisco 49ers is great.

I wish some one would make Steve Sabol of NFL Films to knock it off with the close up shots. That's all his highlights ever are. I would like to be able to see the formations and the whole play. Especially from a historical offense the 49ers had with Joe Montana and Steve Young.",1169251200,2,415,4.3896103896103895
2397352,5,B000AYEL60,Product was perfect I knew it excisted but was hard to find I am a loyal SF fan starting 1969 hopefully they will be back to being competative soon but will watch anyway all the glory years together watch it a bunch go niners,1163116800,,225,4.136363636363637
2397353,3,B000AYEL60,I bought this hoping that I would get to see highlights of each of the five years the 49ers won the super bowl instead they showed highlights of other teams seasons and not the 49ers like I wanted. It was just a general over view of each season and even had segaments talking about other teams and not the 49ers. I did think that the highlights of the super bowls were very good and even the interviews of some of the players were very good.,1157587200,8,441,4.2
2397354,5,B000AYEL60,What a great opportunity to see one of the greatest sports phenomenons in all Football history. Never again will we see 49er teams with such magic and such amazing players. These DVD's are a reminder of how far the 49er franchise has fallen from grace. All 49er fans need this set.,1141862400,,281,4.529411764705882
2397355,5,B000AYEL60,"Yes, its true, all the highlights and features of this 2 dvd set is from the Super Bowl Collection series and there isn't any new video footage.  If you own the Super Bowl XI-XX and the Super Bowl XXI-XXX volumes of the Collection, you may not ""need"" this set, because the 49ers won Super Bowls (XVI, XIX, XXIII & XXIV) which are contained in those volumes.  And, yes, yes, NFL films could have put more into this set with regards to additional footage.  That being said, 49ers fans will love this set because it contains those highlights and features that pertain to only the 49ers championship years and, let's face it, it may be a while before the 49ers ever return to those glory days.  Due to the present state of the club, 49ers fans will be dreary for a while, but they can always relive the glory of the past in this set.  These dvds will stir up a lot of good memories of one of the most charismatic teams to ever dominate the NFL.  Besides the NFL years in review, it's all here:  the Walsh coaching influence on the NFL, the Montana magic, the phenomenal Jerry Rice, etc.  Since the 49ers were the first team to win five Super Bowls, this dvd set contains plenty of footage to capture the excitement and is worth the money.  Recommended.",1141344000,19,1248,4.414847161572053
2397356,5,B000AYEL60,"This is a fine collection of Superbowl games, however because it contains special features about Joe, Steve, and Jerry it is better described as the BEST collection.  Now we need a DVD that is focused on #80 solely.",1140825600,2,215,4.657894736842105
2397357,2,B000AYEL60,I bought this hoping it would really go into detail about each of the 5 49er Superbowls but they really did not get into the the games that much. They just showed highlights of what happened in the season of the year they went to the Superbowls and just highlights of the game itself. There is special features of some players like Young and Rice but they are just interviews from 1999 and 1996 that originally aired on ESPN years ago. Nothing new is on here just old NFL Films shows that they made for ESPN. Very disappointed. They most definitely could have gone into more detail on each game. Terrible.,1131580800,28,605,4.45945945945946

2397370,3,B000AYEL60,"The interviews and extras are nice but the video shows other teams seasons  instead of just focusing on the. 49ers  season and playoffs  like it should be . I reccomend the dvd's on the 49 ers - America's game 5 DVD set and the San Francisco 49ers team history. . Both are sold in amazon and they are great ! I love the. 49ers they are my team. . I'm also soon gonna buy the 49ers DVD called "" team of the 80 's "" . Hope this helps other 49 ers fans - go. 49ers !!!!",1402617600,,466,3.783505154639175

2397374,5,B000AYEL60,"NFL Films did a great job on this package of the 5 SB wins by the Niners!
Since I had season tix for them during the 80s, I'm just slightly biased (you think?).... ha!",1365552000,,167,3.9411764705882355

2397377,1,B000AYEL60,"I am very disappointed in the DVDs I purchased. 15 different supposed super bowl collection series DVDs. A series in which a different super bowl was what the cover depicts for each team. THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS then it gives the number of the super bowl in roman numerals. Other have Americans game the SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP and shows the ring on the cover. Did I miss something? Would that mean the game is what the DVD is about?  Wrong the only super bowls I have received in their eternity are the two Broncos' super bowls of the Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII that came along with the 1977 AFC Championship Game in a three set entitled the Broncos 3 greatest games. Said nothing about super bowl games. The only reason I knew the super bowl games were included was I had researched it on another website what I should have done for these. All very misleading. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning 13 DVD. Very disappointed.
