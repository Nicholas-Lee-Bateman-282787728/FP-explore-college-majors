8189526,4,B000P6R5PM,"As with any History channel feature, there is too much repetition of the previous scene(s) following the break between scenes (possibly the commercial gap). This detracts from the story line and interrupts the flow of the programme.",1463616000,,232,5.297297297297297
8189527,5,B000P6R5PM,"Originally designed to avoid ships being attacked by submarines in 1942 this idea was brought to Howard Hughes. He showed signs of OCD by getting involved in every aspect of creation.  He was also involved in other activities and then he was in a plane crash.

When he recovered the government took him to task for not producing a plane. Eventually he gets one built and takes it for a spin.  Insightful, uses actor reenactments and some actual footage of events.
