7479740,5,B016S45JCU,"Pokemon xy set 2's episodes are nice.
Like any series there will be episodes y'all will enjoy and not.
If your looking for a show like digimon tri.
Y'all Best look on funimation website,,
This is a show to introduce pokemon to everyone and although the story is mainly involving ash's or satoshi's adventure. it is always trying to make the people like ash...
 I am BTW A pokemon scientist not a trainer but the show tries  to make the people who watch it into battlers .
If you are okay with that and like Pokemon battles you will like this show even more
Enjoy",1454889600,2,562,4.3428571428571425

Disks 1 and 3 worked fine, but disk 2 played only half way through before it stopped functioning and shut my player down.  Nothing I did would get it to work.  My advise: Buy new if you want to ensure the purchase plays.",1528329600,,305,4.224137931034483

8737211,5,B016S45JCU,"I saw a review saying ""beware only half the epsiodes"" or whatever. That's completely misleading. When you cross reference the episodes to what has aired  (Google Pokemon XY episode guide, look for wikipedia) they match as far as American releases. For the whole Kalos region episodes you will need to purchase the XY:Kalos Quest sets and XYZ sets. The other review is misleading as a ""complete series"" won't correct it when the Kalos Region are broken into 3 separate series. The Bublagarden websites also has the lists of dvds available for purchase from EVERY season broken down in original release to re-release.",1497225600,,615,5.029411764705882
