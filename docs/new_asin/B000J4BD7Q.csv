8149172,5,B000J4BD7Q,"These Jaw Droppers DVDs are one of my favorite magic DVDs. The videos are high quality, very entertaining and the tricks seem impossible. Larry Anderson's explanations are clear and concise. I did not have trouble learning any of the tricks.
My four-year-old son especially enjoys watching them with his grandfather.
I highly recommend Jaw Droppers. They are a great value.",1190073600,,373,5.233333333333333
8149173,5,B000J4BD7Q,"I am not usually confident in a group and have always admired those who enjoyed sharing. I looked at the first few tricks and was surprised how much laughing and fun the people had watching Larry do these tricks. You could tell that it was the first time they had seen magic like this. The ""Touched By An Angel"" routine really hooked me by the middle of the 1st DVD. I have done the suggested routines and was a WILD SUCCESS!!

The thing is, that Larry uses simple objects to do his magic. Because of this it makes it seem even MORE magical because of the everyday stuff he uses.(Spoons,Dinner rolls,Straws Etc. I especially loved the ""marked quarter/in a SEALED sugar Packet"" routine wherein a quarter is given to a spectator and marked by them. It disappears and is found in side a sealed sugar packet-you tear open the packet and pour out the sugar right on the table as the quarter falls at the same time the sugar does on the table.

Maximum fun very little effort to perform.",1169164800,,981,4.444444444444445
