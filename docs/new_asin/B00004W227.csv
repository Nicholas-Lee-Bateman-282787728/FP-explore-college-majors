1361294,5,B00004W227,"Before the show was sullied by the addition of Cheryl Ladd, Shelly Hack and Tanya Roberts, it was an unlikely example of both feminisim (women working together to save each other from abuse) and anti-feminism (the bad woman is still butch and grotesque).
Featuring a very young Kim Bassinger, this episode is a classic for Charlie's Angels fans. Set approximately in the first half of the first season of the ABC series, it features flouncy hair, guns and empowered women. This time, the angels are going undercover in a corupt women's prison to save women from being the warden's call girls.
Yes, the idea of a prison prostitution ring is designed to titilate the audience, but the fact that the Angels are resucing those women breaks from the traditional damsel in distress routine. Although critics blasted it and suggested that it was a cheesecake factory, it (unlike the modern counterpart, baywatch) is much less exploitative for women.
This series is so much more, that is should be considered the path breaker for Buffy the Vampire Slayer which shows brains and beauty can coexist.",982972800,,1089,4.956284153005464

1361297,4,B00004W227,"The series was based on three female detectives who worked for the Charles Townsend Detective Agency. Charlie, who was their anonymous boss, gave them  assignments via a speaker phone. The show was based on guns, hair, and  make-up. The trio consisted of Sabrina Ducan (Kate Jackson) best known for  being the ""smart angel,"" Jill Munroe (Farrah Fawcett) known as  the ""athelic angel,"" and rounding out the team was ""street  wise"" Kelly Garrett (Jaclyn Smith). The Angels worked with their  trusty male counter-part, John Bosley, played by David Doyle.
Charlie's  Angels was a huge success the moment it hit the airwaves. Each Wednesday  night, around 10 o'clock, women tuned in for the clothing and hair, while  men just tuned in.

7924724,5,B00004W227,"This is not just another episode of Charlie's Angels, this IS Charlie's Angels!! This is the episode most fans and non fans alike remember for good reason. The Angels are gorgeous and the adventure is non-stop, right down to the butch campy prison guard to the creepy old lady warden. The corrupt Sherriff and his sidekick are entertaining as well as Kim Bassinger as an inmate Kelly befriends and later lands a receptionist job at Townsend Agency, but we never see her again. Great Video!! If you want to know what started the phenomenon known as Charlie's Angels, buy this video!!",1167782400,,582,4.772277227722772
7924725,5,B00004W227,"This one episode alone displays the essence of ""Charlie's Angels."" It's what the pop-culture obsession, that continues to this day, is all about. This episode comes from the first season, in the fall of 1976. I believe it's show number four. Sabrina, Jill, and Kelly are given the undercover assignment to investigate crimes, ranging from rape to murder, in an all-women's prison. It's non-stop action from the moment the trio is picked up on false drug possession charges. Watch for the action and excitement as the three try to escape their own deadly fate with the bad guys... It's probably the most popular and well-known of all the episodes in the show's history. By the way, in or out of prison, these girls always look GREAT...",1059264000,,734,4.833333333333333
7924726,5,B00004W227,"This episode has become a cult classic! The angels go undercover as prison inmates to uncover a prostitution ring. Among the guests stars of this episode are Lauren Tewes(Julie on Love Boat) and a young Kim Bassinger. But the real treat is seeing cult movie icon MARY WARONOV of ""Eating Raoul,"",""Rock and roll high school"" and Andy Warhol fame. Seeing Mary Woronov as a sadistic prison warden is a hoot and any Woronov fan needs to own this episode! (during admission to the prison while the angels are being sprayed down with a cleaner by Maxine: KELLEY(Jaclyn Smith) says to MAXINE(Mary Waronov) ""How long has it been sinse you've been sprayed?""  MAxine: ""Get cute in here deary and you can get hurt!""HILLARIOUS campy dialouge! Besides the guest stars, the episode is top-notch camp at it's peak! This episode is the highest rated of the series(including the re-runs in syndication) and is a MUST for Mary Woronov fans and Charlie's Angels fans!",1044230400,,947,4.881987577639752

7924728,5,B00004W227,"This two-part special edition is definitely a collector's item especially for those die-hard ""Charlie's Angels"" fans. It features Jaclyn Smith, who deserves the recognition as the ""most angelic of them all,"" and two of the best episodes of the series. We're not talking award-winning stuff in this dvd issue but an outstanding entertainment to ""visit"" the undisputed queens of the 70s television.
The episode ""Night of the Strangler"" shows why Jaclyn Smith  lasted so long in the series. Her looks and style are timeless plus that scene in her famous white bikini is a must to see. Of course, Kate Jackson and Farrah Fawcett are on hand to complete the trio.
For the episode ""To Kill An Angel,"" new fans will be surprise that the show is not just pure bikini's and guns. It showcases also the dramatic sides of the trio.
The cover alone is worth the trip, so buy it now and collect! A must!",994809600,,890,4.6687898089171975
