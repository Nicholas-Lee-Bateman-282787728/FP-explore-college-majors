2678743,5,B000JSE01I,"I've heard it said Shawn Trautman ""owns"" the West Coast Swing and it's true. This couple nails the instruction of West Coast Swing. This DVD will save you hundreds of dollars in lessons.",1173830400,15,186,4.666666666666667
2678744,5,B000JSE01I,"We already had an intro to West Coast Swing but this DVD gave us a rock solid foundation on which to build and incorporate the few steps we had already learned. Shawn and Joanna start with the basics - connection points, lead and follow, footwork - and build from there. They provide step-by-step explanation and demonstration of each step for both the leader and follower. So whether your are brand new to WCS or have had a taste but want to make sure you have a good foundation, this is a great place to start. We highly recommend it.",1171843200,7,536,4.424242424242424
2678745,5,B000JSE01I,"This is an excellent teaching video. Shawn and his wife are gifted and patient at teaching the very basic swing steps. I love that they provide plenty of practice, practice, practice.",1171411200,7,183,4.935483870967742
2678746,5,B000JSE01I,"My husband and I took a dance class about 2 years ago in preparation for our wedding. We learned the basic steps but after our ""first dance"", we never used them again. After watching this DVD, we were ready to hit the dance floor once again. The step-by-step directions were easy to follow. The re-cap of what was taught in each section really helped us put it all together. We were all over our carpet - literally cutting a rug. :) The instructors really make it look easy so we found it easy to follow. The title should be West Coast Swing for Dummies. I can't wait to get another DVD to learn a new dance.",1165276800,9,608,4.25
2678747,5,B000JSE01I,"My wife and I are new to ballroom dancing in the last year.  We've taken some lessons, but found that we needed the extra help of videos that we can use on our own schedule in our home and we've tried a bunch of them.  This DVD and the whole series of new videos from Shawn Trautman have been a godsend and much more useful to us than the others we've tried.  We are actually doing the dances within a short time and having fun, rather than getting aggravated with one another.  Trautman's emphasis on the differing roles of leader and follower and the very clear demonstrations of those roles have helped us enormously.  These DVDs include much more music and time to practice the new steps than most videos, rather than just watching an instructor do a step and go to another step.  We like this video a lot and strongly recommend it.  On a side note, the logistics/timing of shipping and subsequent email communications with the company were, after many frustrations with other online outfits, the best we've seen.",1165276800,18,1017,4.585635359116022
2678748,5,B000JSE01I,"Shawn and Joanna broke it down into basics that I could understand.  West Coast Swing always intimidated me before, but not anymore.  Easy to follow, and it was as if they were in my living room with me.  I recommend this highly.",1164672000,7,229,4.404761904761905
2678749,5,B000JSE01I,"The instructors did a good job of breaking down the basics of west coast swing, including footwork, connection, leverage, lead and follow and the style of the dance. The video flowed well and was easy to follow along.",1164585600,8,217,4.7368421052631575
2678750,5,B000JSE01I,"This West Coast Swing video combined the rhythm and dance steps all together for me so that I can actually do them!  I like the way both the leader and the follower can learn the steps and patterns of this dance easily during the video because of the views of the footwork and rhythm that can be seen from the side.  You can tell that these instructors know exactly what you need to see to learn the steps, especially the compression and leverage part that makes this dance different from other dance styles!  I know that I will review this lesson again and I am really looking forward to learning additional steps in Volume 2 of Shawn's West Coast Swing Dance Collection!",1164499200,7,672,4.491803278688525
2678751,5,B000JSE01I,Shawn and Joanna Trautman are excellent instructors! This DVD shows all the basics of West Coast Swing so that you can learn in the privacy of your own home and then go out and impress everyone at the clubs! I was able to follow easily-it felt like they were teaching me in person.,1164412800,9,281,4.320754716981132
2678815,5,B000JSE01I,"My wife and I have been ballroom dancing for about six years and when we became interested in learning the WCS about a year ago (we love its musical versatility), we purchased Shawn Trautman's Beginners Volume 1 to help us learn the fundamentals. His teaching style was easy to understand and we quickly learned the basic moves. We tried taking a couple lessons but at four hours per roundtrip, that option got old fast, so we recently purchased the next two DVDs in the series, Beginners Volume 2 and Intermediate Volume 1, and are working on taking our WCS dancing to even higher levels. We have tried other WCS instructional DVDs but none compare to Shawn's and Joanna's approach (my wife particularly likes how she thoroughly explains the woman's part).",1306195200,2,757,4.8307692307692305
2678816,5,B000JSE01I,"Thie DVD and two that follow makes learning the west coast swing easy. They clearly explain every-move every step of the way. I have had absolutely no dance history and in a month we are doing routines from all three dvds. The basic Vol 1 teaches you the basic steps and several type of turns and you can be out dancing in a week or two. For a person who has two left feet, I never thought that I would get it but I did, We plan on continuing our lessons with other dvds",1301270400,,470,4.01063829787234
2678817,1,B000JSE01I,"From an instructional point of view this is an extremely poor video.  The instructors talk way too much, especially about their next DVD, instead of focusing on what they need to teach on THIS DVD.  I don't believe they have actually taught WCS since they don't go over the hurdles someone totally new to WCS would have to overcome.  The basic rhythm pattern of WCS involves two triple steps (three steps in two beats of music).  Unless you know cha cha, which also has a triple step, you will never get the triple step from the video. Some free videos I have seen on YouTube are actually more effective at teaching the basics of WCS. Search ""west coast swing Manhattan"" in YouTube for videos that I have found actually effective. Even good videos can at best give you a notion;instruction will be necessary for most people.",1300147200,5,824,4.623287671232877
2678818,5,B000JSE01I,"West Coast Swing

My wife and I attended a New Years Eve Dance two years ago and after watching some dancers, we were inspired to learn how to dance.  After trying an expensive dance instructor who limited each dance session to one or two moves, we gave up and decided to look at dance DVDs on Amazon.com. After trying numerous DVD instructors, we discovered Shawn Trautman's DVDs had the best instructions and was the easiest to follow.  West Coast Swing is a very difficult dance, but Shawn Trautman made it so easy that in very short time, we graduated from beginners to the intermediate dancers.  Shawn and his wife, Joanna, are so thorough when giving the best complete explanation of each move. He also allows you to learn and practice each step before moving to the next step, You don't have to continually rewind and play over and over like so many other DVD instructors.  Shawn and his wife explain and show in detail how each dance partner is to perform each step.  Now, we are continually asked in various dance halls where did we learn how to dance?  We wasted money buying many different DVD's by other instructors, which were very difficult to follow. We are now are concentrating on learning other dance DVDs by Shawn Trautman.  He makes dancing so easy and it has become our favorite pastime.  We feel so grateful that we bought Shawn DVDs and have lots of fun.  \Shawn Trautman videos prove to us that he is ""The very best West Coast Instructor"".",1252540800,,1463,4.613899613899614
2678819,4,B000JSE01I,"This is a good introduction to West Coast Swing that will give you a feel for whether or not you like this style, but it's no replacement for lessons.  Sure, the instructions are pretty good (for a video) and these guys know their stuff, but there are a lot of subtle things that are best learned from one-on-one instruction.  Somebody working with you personally will be able to give you instant feedback and let you know when you're messing up or doing something right, so you don't develop bad habits.

This is a great video and you should definitely check it out, but use it as a supplement to real, in-person lessons, not as a substitute.  The good dancers in the club definitely are. :)",1250640000,2,692,4.512
2678820,3,B000JSE01I,"I bought this some time ago, Shawn does a good job, but as a dancer I have always felt that the explanation's should only come from one instructor. If you listen too both parties, the instruction loses focus",1211155200,,207,4.473684210526316
2678821,5,B000JSE01I,"My spouse and I have watched a number of dance videos.  Some are pretty good, some not so good.  Shawn and Joanna's are first rate.  We have several, including West Coast Swing for Beginners I and II, Intermediate West Coast Swing, and Beginning Hustle.  We have already ordered several more. What do we like about them?  I'm glad you asked:

Shawn's instructions are VERY clear.  He has a background as a trainer, so this helps in his ability to communicate instructions.  He uses the old adage, ""tell them what you're gonna tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them--except he substitutes the word ""show"" for ""tell.""  They may not be the most ""entertaining"" products on the market, but they are probably the most thorough.

They focus on technique, which is just as important as knowing lots of steps.  They always spend a lot of time talking about connection points, tips for leading and following, styling, etc.  Some people think their pace is too slow, but I assure you that once you finish you will know how to dance, and how to dance correctly.

At the beginning of each section (usually there are four sections on a video) Shawn will demonstrate the steps he is about to teach (and will explainn what it is that they are about to teach).  This is extremely valuable because when you come back later to review (which you invariably will), you don't have to go back through the whole lesson, you can just get the highlights.  In most cases, that's all you will need.  By the way, this solves one of the problems of live classes.  Usually you forget  key details of what you learned and you have no way of reviewing until your next lesson.  With Shawn and Joanna's videos, you can literally get a review of an entire lesson in just five minutes.

The lighting and sound is professional.  Joanna adds a bit of personality to the duo.  This is refreshing because in a lot of videos, only the guy teaches.  Joanna isn't just a pretty face along for the ride.  She provides women with valuable information about what the lead should feel like and how to follow.

We took a 90 minute West Coast Swing class locally.  We learned probably twice as much in our 90 minutes with Shawn and Joanna than we did in the same amount of time with a live dance instructor, and did I forget to mention the fact that you are able to go back and review as often as necessary.  Dollar for dollar, you just cannot go wrong with these videos.

I only have two criticisms.  One stems from the inherent nature of learning to dance off of a DVD and the other is something Shawn and Joanna can actually correct.  First, you don't get feedback from an instructor to tell you whether what you are doing is correct.  This is where supplementing the DVD's with a class might be helpful.  However, you'll cut down your expenses since you won't need as much instruction.  The second problem is that sometimes they get to fancy with the cameras.  Just as they are about to introduce a step, the camera will zoom in or out, which can be kind of distracting and it takes a couple seconds for your eyes to adjust.

Overall, these are excellent products that I would highly recommend.",1202169600,10,3165,4.522045855379189
2678822,5,B000JSE01I,"First i want to thank Shawn for making such great DVD's to teach with, I have been to live classes and they put so much stuff at you you can't follow and you get lost and discouraged but Shawn's videos bring out the best in you as he breaks it down so you can understand the dances, we went back to the DVD's to learn the proper style of the West Coast Swing again thanks Shawn & Joanna for all you do to help us learn the right way........Tom Ward<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/West-Coast-Swing-for-Beginners-Volume-1-Shawn-Trautman-s-Dance-Collection/dp/B000JSE01I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">West Coast Swing for Beginners Volume 1 (Shawn Trautman's Dance Collection)</a>",1201824000,4,712,5.922330097087379
2678823,5,B000JSE01I,"Shawn and Joanna Trautman present the essentials of West Coast Swing in an easy to learn, carefully thought out, step-by-step format that insures learner success and confidence.  As a retired teacher and high school coach, I was very impressed with the instructional methods the Trautmans used in this DVD.  They give a brief overview of each new dance sequence, demonstrate the sequence, and break it into easy to follow steps. They guide the learners through ample, step-by-step practice to insure mastery and confidence before building to the next sequence.  Suggestions for lead and follow techniques from Shawn for the male dancers and Joanna for the ladies, ensure that their students will be able to dance lead and follow West Coast Swing with any partner.  Finally, practice is provided with music to permit the learners to master their new skills with appropriate tempo.  Each lesson closes with a brief review to insure you're on target.

I found the DVD the next best thing to expensive private lessons from a highly skilled dance instructor.  Save yourself money and learn West Coast basics from dance masterteachers.  Otherwise, you can spend hundreds of dollars on private or group lessons and not learn as much as you can from from the Trautman's video. You can follow up with the Trautman's West Coast Beginner's Volume 2 and West Coast Intermediate DVD's and get thoroughly grounded in Swing dance.",1196640000,6,1415,5.068965517241379
2678824,5,B000JSE01I,"Other than dancing with my son at his wedding, I am a dancing ""newbie""--so green that I was reluctant to go to a dance class!  I have wanted to learn to dance for many years but never had a partner so I decided to take matters into my own hands and begin with DVD instruction.  I made several unsuccessful phone calls with various suppliers until I happened upon Shawn Trautman's order department.  An operator helped me personally select the first two DVD's to suit my needs and then long-story-short, I have purchased 12 DVD's to date. I received a personal email follow-up making sure that I had received the DVD's and that I was satisfied.

Shawn Trautman's teaching style is comprehensive and clear allowing for plenty of practice time within the lesson.  The DVD format has all chapters clearly labeled allowing for precise access to a desired spot in the lesson.  He and his wife, Joanna, give the lessons with plenty of tips for men on how to lead effectively and for the women, how to follow responsively...also provided are the much-needed tips on how to look stylish and confident as you take your first steps on the dance floor.  It's great for us who fit into the ""fake it 'til you make it"" category!

I was cautioned by dancing friends to make sure the instruction I received was accurate as to avoid learning faulty technique.  I have learned enough at home to Swing dance with several different partners and I have been complimented on my technique when I confess that I am a beginner.  Thanks for the great product!",1180742400,10,1532,4.640740740740741

8152790,5,B000JSE01I,"Most of my experience with Shawn's DVDs has been with their previous series. Most of this has been West Coast Swing, though I've also used the East Coast series and have one or two others for later use. I have just started on the one that picks up where the old WCS series picks up, and it seems enough like the others for me to think it will be up to those standards.

For starters, I think fairly few people could learn WCS just from these or any other DVDs. It is a hard dance to master and both group and occasional individual instruction will make a big difference. However, I have found these DVDs really valuable for reviewing the basics and for learning new patterns. Yes they do have a tendency to chatter, as one review noted, but the chatter is about the dance, and sometimes contains material that a novice won't understand but should hear, such as connection which is a key and difficult concept in WCS. I find the DVDs in particular have these three pluses:
1. They are clear, showing and talking about the moves from different angles. There's opportunity for people with different learning styles to pick them up.
2. The progression of moves is sensible. Many group lessons and U tube videos are mostly independent of the previous week's lesson. These DVDs follow a logical progression, so the viewer feels a gradual but continual improvement
3. Most of the curriculum is about groups of related moves: different whip variations, different exits, etc. This makes it easier for the beginner (well, advanced beginner) to feel that he or she is going on the floor with a decent number of alternatives.
I know people who can see a pattern once and immediately own it. Folk like that would probably not find the careful reviewing of these DVDs particularly useful.",1333411200,,1774,4.667731629392971
8152791,5,B000JSE01I,"I am a brand new dancer...everyone told me the West Coast Swing was too hard to learn.  They said to learn the other dances first, then move on to the WCS.  But I bought the Shawn Trautman West Swing DVD and I was west coasting in less than a week!  Even though the dance is a little tougher than most, Shawn teaches in a simplistic way.  Shawn teaches the leader's part and his wife Joanna teaches the follower's part.  The DVD is a great value...on Shawn Trautman DVD costs less than 15 minutes of private lessons...and I can keep practicing with the DVD! Now I can say I love the West Coast Swing...thank you Shawn & Joanna Trautman!!!",1325462400,,638,4.372881355932203
