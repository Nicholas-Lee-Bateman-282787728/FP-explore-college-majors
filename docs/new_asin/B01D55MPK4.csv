Is the price correct? DVD $50 bluray $35 isn't that the other way around? Bluray is more expensive.

7697231,2,B01D55MPK4,Good show but it appears that it is only the first half of season 1 which has 23 eps.  The listing says 485 min. Do the math.  A bit confusing cause 5 disks for reg dvd can hold 23 eps.  The 4 disk bluray is telling though.,1468886400,2,223,3.702127659574468

7697233,5,B01D55MPK4,"I won't go into as much detail as some of the other reviewers, but I'll simply say that this is the best show I've seen in years.

If you enjoy shows like Person Of Interest, Kiefer Sutherland's ""24"", Covert Affairs, Alias, and the Jason Bourne movies...you'll love Blindspot! This has an outstanding ensemble cast...all of whom are more than a little pleasant to look at...and this is only bolstered by the outstanding writing, twisting plot lines, and really solid acting. I haven't seen a show this good in a long, long time!",1464048000,19,528,4.739130434782608
7697234,5,B01D55MPK4,"When I first read of the premise for this show, I wasn't sure how much it would resonate with me.  The idea of a young woman, with no memory of her prior life, being found in Times Square covered only in tattoos sounded pretty outlandish.  However, my initial reaction proved incorrect as I really enjoy this show. It is one of my favorite new series this year.

Jane Doe has been dumped in Times Square and, when found, has no memory of who she is, how she received her telling tattoos, and how she ended up  well  anywhere.  When the feds discover a connection between her tattoos to crimes that are about to happen, Jane becomes a valuable property for them to keep under their protective custody.

As the first season continues, we find out more and more about Jane.  She is much more than the victim that she appears early in the season.  I don't want to give away the shows, so I will leave it at that.  Jane is a force to reckon with and what I appreciate after so many whimpy women in action roles, she can handle herself in hand-to-hand combat and usually comes out the winner.

The cast of this series makes it very believable.  I keep getting blown away by how well British and Australian actors can do an American accent. Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Bethany Mayfair does a fantastic accent.  Having just seen her on series 2 of Broadchurch had me questioning which accent was real.  Sullivan Stapleton has a rough and gruff demeanor and a voice to match.  Again, I had to question which accent was real.

For me, the entire cast makes the show but I am especially drawn to Jaimie Alexander as Jane Doe.  She has the look of being entirely vulnerable and then out of nowhere  wham  she shows she can take care of not only herself but her friends and crew as well.

I'm looking forward to seeing where all of this is leading and look forward to another new season of deciphering tattoos and learning more of Ms. Doe's past.",1462147200,27,1931,4.431818181818182
7697235,4,B01D55MPK4,"NBC has poached the two studly leads from Strike Back and plonked each in their own action thriller show. And as much as I resented Cinemax's cancelling Strike Back, I'm just as glad that Sullivan Stapleton and Philip Winchester have landed on their feet. Between Stapleton's Blindspot and Winchester's The Player, it's Blindspot what seems destined for a longer burn, if you go by the ratings. It's certainly got the superior title. The Player, as much as I'm floored by the wonky premise, sounds like yet another dumb reality show that the unknowing remote control warrior may just choose to pass on.

Really, Blindspot is just another fresh twist in the cop drama genre. But, oh, man, the premise works so hard to hook you in: In New York, an amnesiac - and very nekkid - woman (Jaimie Alexander) covered in tattoos emerges from an abandoned duffel bag. FBI Special Agent Kurt Weller (Stapleton) and his team get very excited when, come to find, each tattoo on ""Jane Doe"" hints at a terrible crime yet to come. Note that it's some unknown artist who'd inked those tats on her all at the same time and without her consent. Things get even more interesting when Jane Doe begins exhibiting mad special forces skills.

It's a solid cast, and Stapleton once again camouflages his Aussieness to produce a passable American accent, and he's fine in the role and he's gruff and gritty and his neck beard impresses. But let's not front, the big get is Jaimie Alexander. I'd been waiting for her to step out of Lady Sif's shadow. This new role allows her to play in a (comparatively) more grounded genre. It allows her to test out her acting chops even as she preserves her asskicking creds.

I haven't had my system flooded with amnesia-inducing zeta interacting protein, so I can't say how thorough is Jane Doe's memory loss. But the mystery of her is one running thread that I promptly got invested in. It's neat that there's a systematic order to sussing out Jane's tats. ""The first clue unlocks the second,"" crows the team's resident Abby Sciuto (Ashley Johnson). Now, I get it why Jane would be so all the time dour and broody, but I wish Agent Weller would lighten up some, would show more color to his personality (Stapleton's Sgt. Damien Scott in Strike Back so far is a stronger character). It would help if the dialogue were better. Thankfully, Ashley Johnson brings in some levity. Anyway, I'm in it for now. Alexander and Stapleton make for compelling eye candy, and their past works have earned them enough latitude from me. And Jaimie Alexander simply looks stunning. The cynical part of me would like to point out that Blindspot is a very calculated show, that as intriguing as the premise is, the suits and showrunners hedge their bet by initially not ever passing up an opportunity to have Jaimie Alexander going nekkid to examine her tattoos for clues or the lab team examining her tattoos for clues. But I am a guy, so it works on me. I can't wait to see where Jane's quest of self-discovery would take her, and how she fills out the blank canvas that she is currently, and what other amazing knack she'll unveil. And I hope the overarching tattoo mystery and the two leads' rep for badassery are enough to surmount that creaky case-of-the-week formula. The blah second episode, ""A Stray Howl,"" about killer drones and another goof who wants to teach the government a lesson, didn't exactly wow me, and now I'm a bit concerned that the show won't be able to sustain its steam. But the second ep did at least further the tattoo mystery and deliver a possible 'splanation for why Agent Weller's name is featured so prominently on Jane's back. If the network suits had been more cunning, they would've had the tat artist sneak in a plug for The Player on Jane somewhere. The former Sgt. Stonebridge could probably use the assist.

That above was stuff I wrote up some months ago. Update (5/1/2016): 19 episodes in, and I'm liking the show more and more, even as the overarching plotline gets ever more labyrinthine. Details of Jane's nebulous past are slowly getting etched in, and even the supporting characters have gotten fleshed out. But they're still keeping it close to the vest with regards to Weller who, in some ways, is still this indiscernible cat. But the 19th ep, ""In the Comet of Us,"" is an epic action thrill ride and indicative of why the show grabs you so hard. Sure, the police procedural elements cast a pedestrian vibe. But the show rewards you often enough with big reveals and with ample opportunities for Jane to show off her skill set, never mind that, as secrets are disclosed, her allegiance gets more torn up than The Player on a television critic's Microsoft Word document.

Also, The Player may have gotten its 13 episodes chopped down to 9, but there's still no official word that it's been cancelled. So keep hope alive, Philip Winchester.",1462147200,3,4880,4.696261682242991

7697385,4,B01D55MPK4,"A mysterious woman emerges from a duffel bag left in Times Square.
Naked, she is covered in tattoos.
She cannot remember her name or anything about her past.
She does not know why she has been tattooed, or what they mean.
And she absolutely does not know why one of those tattoos is the name of an FBI agent assigned to the New York City office.
""Blindspot,"" starring Sullivan Stapleton as FBI agent Kurt Weller and Jaime Alexander as the mystery woman, is very good television. It has a complex plot, some very fine performances not only from Stapleton and Alexander but also from a really excellent supporting cast, and features some nice writing and cinematography.
If I can find fault with this first season in what I hope will be a long-running series, it is that some of the episodes feature deductive leaps that seemed, well, implausible. I was a journalist for nearly a half century and in that time I covered a lot of cops on local, state, and federal levels. None of them were capable of deductions worthy of Sherlock Holmes. That's not to say that they were intellectually incapable of making often brilliant deductions, but only to point out that it took them more time to arrive at them than the writers gave their fictional FBI agents in this first season.
That said, this is a very good series that, in addition to its other attributes, makes viewers think about some timely issues as they watch.
Can't ask for much more than that, in my opinion, so I give it 4.5 stars and would recommend it to people who like police dramas with an intriguing twist.",1474588800,13,1566,4.5964285714285715

Maybe Hollywood is regurgitating the same plots over and over. That does not necessarily mean that this show sux or deserves to be over looked...does it?",1474243200,2,276,4.653061224489796

I immediately went back (via DVR) and watched it again, as with every episode that followed. The only downside was the commercials, so there was no question that I'll own every  Box-set Season *as soon as it's available. Meaning I pre-ordered this one approx. 3 (three) months prior to it's release. This Show is absolutely AMAZING !!!!",1472169600,4,426,4.532467532467533
7697409,5,B01D55MPK4,"Blindspot was definitely one of the better new shows of the past season. It does take some suspension of disbelief, and yes if you are one to nitpick everything about a TV show then you will probably hate it.

It is, at its core a puzzle show. As most know from the promos that aired before the pilot, the main premise was that a woman (Jane Doe, Played by Jamie Alexander who most recently played Lady Sif in the Thor films, and the Agents of Shield TV show) is found in a bag in Times Square with no memory of who she is and tattoos all over her body, with the name of FBI agent Kurt Weller (played by Sullivan Stapleton) tattooed on her back. Needless to say one of the main themes of the season is trying to answer the question of who she really is. I cannot say much more than that without spoiling too much but a key point from the first couple episodes on is whether she is someone from Weller's past.

The show mainly takes on a case of the week format as the FBI team basically decodes more of the tattoos and cases they are leading to. Some are key to the more central plot lines that run throughout the season, and some are more of a one off and done case. While I would not say it tried to be too ""brainy"" of a show, it does tackle some serious issues like Human Trafficking, and a mirror of the campus shootings combined with a Penn State like scandal. Some of the various government scandals from the past couple decades are worked in there too, like a takeoff on the NSA surveillance program.

Ultimately I think the show does a good job in giving away enough of the overall story, without giving away too much by the end of the season. While some questions are answered there is a lot going into season 2. Also, the show does very well in giving all the characters in the ensemble cast some depth, although the focus of the show is clearly on Weller and Jane. Of the ""ancillary"" cast I think that Ashley Johnson is the standout as Patterson, the computer nerd/scientist of the bunch, who brings a lot of the more humorous moments to the show, without being complete comic relief all the time. Overall though all the actors, whether series regulars or guest stars I think did a great job in their various roles.

For those who get the blu rays, the show looks and sounds great as you would expect. Unlike one of the two star reviewers who clearly ""reviewed"" the product before it ever came out, yes all 23 episodes are there. Amazon's description is wrong. They are spread over 4 discs. For extras there are deleted scenes for most (but not all) of the episodes. A commentary track on the pilot episode with a couple of the show's creators (but none of the actors). On the final disc there are all the behind the scenes and making of material, that range from putting the cast together, the story behind the tattoos, one of the better recurring characters in the show (who will hopefully have more than just a couple appearances in season 2) Richdotcom, and 15 minutes of the Comicon panel with the producers, writers and Jamie Alexander. A good amount of material for those who want to go through the bonus material.

It will take some suspension of disbelief to accept everything that goes on. But lets face it the premise of the show is pretty absurd to begin with, so it is not all that surprising that they take some logic leaps and make things up. And yes, all the characters can fight and run and still have perfect hair and makeup, pretty much like every lead character in every action show and movie ever. So if some detail that stupid would be something that would keep you from enjoying a show then do not even bother with this. If you have not seen any of the episodes yet I would advise streaming a couple episodes to see if you like it, then make the decision whether to invest in the blu rays or DVDs. If you did watch the show during its original run, there are definitely enough extra materials to make getting the discs worth it.",1471737600,7,3962,4.355886332882274
7697410,2,B01D55MPK4,"From the opening episode, the script is fraught with mistakes, such as.... how did ""Jane"" know how many acres Liberty Island comprised if she indeed had no memory? And you MIGHT expect that a couple of episodes in, she'd manage to do something with her hair, Also everytime there was a national emergency, only the lead characters seemed to end up on the scene, far too reminiscent of 24, when Jack Bauer was told that ""a team is ten minutes out"" Of course with countless bullets flying in some scenes, only the villains are ever hit. I'm admittedly only 5 episodes in, and am hoping that the quality of scripts gets more riveting. And the lead actor MIGHT take some acting lessons before Season 2.",1471132800,4,698,4.592

the female lead could not fight her way out of a wet paper bag and she is supposed to be the first ever female navy seal---

her hair style looks like a reject from SOMETHING ABOUT MARY---

the bad guys all have automatic weapons but cannot hit anybody--
