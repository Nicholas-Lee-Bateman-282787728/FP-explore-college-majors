8295746,5,B001E07FUS,"The movie is great, absolute classic. What's more to say? It's got some nice bonus features

It comes with a cd of the songs in the movie. The paper insert has all the lyrics printed on it which is fantastic.

The shirt it comes with should fit most dudes, assuming your six foot and chubby, but it's not too bad and you can try shrinking it. Most noticeably, THE SHIRT ABSOLUTELY WREAKED when I got it. That must have been in one smelly frigging warehouse. However, after several washes and time spent wearing the shirt, it's fine now.",1313193600,,536,4.459183673469388

8295750,5,B001E07FUS,"Truly a collector's item, this set is a great deal.

The product description says the T-shirt is size L, but the one in my package was XL.  The printing is good quality shiny/sparkly silver ink/paint.  It is an Anvil brand T-shirt, and smells just like a concert T.  It is pretty big for an XL, and a little bit short in length.

The CD has all the songs from the movie.  I believe all the songs are studio recordings from around 1984, so the sound quality is not quite up to 2010 standards.  Still it is fun to own, and listen to, an album that is as close as you can get to ""Smell the Glove.""

I haven't watched the DVD yet, but it is the Special Edition, with many bonus features.",1271980800,8,683,4.121212121212121

8295754,5,B001E07FUS,"Spinal Tap. Not your everyday mulleted metal-rockers -- oh no, they're the loudest band in the world.

Or so says Marti DiBergi (played with a straight face by director Rob Reiner), in a hysterical ""rockumentary"" that focuses on the dumber side of rock'n'roll. ""This is Spinal Tap"" has become the quintessential rock'n'roll movie -- full of strangely lifelike jokes, gigantic hair, annoying girlfriends, hilarious acting, and a many an exploding drummer from time to time.

Spinal Tap, the loudest band in Britain, is returning to the US for the first time in years to promote their new album, ""Smell The Glove."" Trailing behind them is DiBergi, capturing every strange moment on film and interviewing the solemnly strange trio that makes up the core, Nigel (Christopher Guest), Derek (Harry Shearer), and David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean). Their many drummers have died in a series of bizarre freak accidents (including the vague ""gardening accident""), choking on someone else's vomit, and spontaneous combustion).

Charting the history of the band (including psychedelic rock) to the present, DiBergi chronicles the controversy that springs up around ""Smell the Glove""'s sexist cover (""What's wrong with being sexy?"" ""Sex-IST!""). After bizarre mishaps (a Stonehenge set the size of a cat), waning popularity and falling sales, the manager quits in anger and Nigel walks out. Is it the end of Spinal Tap?

One of the funniest ways make something funny is to stay really, really close to reality -- and that is where ""This is Spinal Tap"" strikes gold. It sticks JUST close enough to be semi-accurate, but remains just on the outside line of comedy -- basically, if you like laughtracks, gross-out humour and pratfalls, this isn't your kind of movie.

The humor is all the funnier because it's delivered in a deadpan manner: Nigel's amp that ""goes to 11,"" the cucumber incident, or when Derek gets trapped in a plastic pod, and has to be freed via a desperate roadie with a blowtowtorch. And sprinkled in between are little interviews between DiBergi and the band, littered with hilarious quotables (""It's like fire and ice, basically. I feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that, kind of like lukewarm water"").

In fact, Reiner manages to craft a very believable rock'n'roll world, complete with label controversies, Sinatra-loving chauffeurs, groupies and frequent technical malfunctions. And the music... hoo boy, just try not to laugh at ""Gimme Some Money,"" ""Sex Farm,"" ""Listen To The Flower People,"" and the sidesplitting ""Big Bottom"" (""Big bottoms drive me out of my mind/how could I leave that behind?""). Not to mention Nigel's ghastly Druid monologue.

And rock in-jokes are sprinkled liberally through the movie. There are homages to Black Sabbath (the teeny Stonehenge), Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin (playing a guitar with a violin), and countless other little jokes. Even Jeanine is based on famed rock girlfriends like Yoko Ono and Anita Pallenberg.

As for the actors... well, reportedly they made up a lot of their dialogue on the wing, which might explain why they are so unspeakably funny. You'd almost think they were real -- in fact, a few uninformed people have.

Guest and McKean form the core of the story, as the lovably clueless Nigel (""It's one louder"") and the savvier, too-influenced-by-his-girlfriend David. These guys really rule the screen with their rambling dialogue and gigantic hair. The hairy Harry Shearer is less front-and-center, but both he's pretty funny too -- as is Reiner, who somehow manages to keep a straight face through it all.

""Christmas Story"" recently got the ultramegadeluxe treatment, and thankfully ""This is Spinal Tap"" is being treated no less kindly. Not only does it have the DVD, but a a T-shirt and the utterly hilarious soundtrack -- also called ""Smell the Glove."" Lots of glorious songs on here that are also in the movie, such as ""Sex Farm,"" ""Hell Hole,"" ""Stonehenge"" and even the drippy ""Listen To Me (Flower People)."" Dear Lord, I love that stuff.

""This is Spinal Tap"" is the ultimate rock movie -- a funny, deadpan, wittily mocking little look at the world's loudest band. A treasure.",1218240000,5,4172,5.067055393586005
