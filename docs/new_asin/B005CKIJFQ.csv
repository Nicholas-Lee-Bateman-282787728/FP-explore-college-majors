4653610,3,B005CKIJFQ,"This series is intended as an introduce . . . a simple view that is easy to follow. The reenactments offer a glimpse of Czarist Russia and a few clips of original footage  are included. WWI was catastrophic and reshaped the world. Czar Nicholas II? If you expect the events of this timeline to be addressed in eleven minutes, you will be disappointed. Presented in a 'movie trailer' format, only the basics are included. Viewing this video allows one to decide if a more thorough study would be of interest. Recommended for those who want an accurate summation of events . . . this is not intended as an overview. The reenactments are well done and present the opulence of Saint Petersburg during this timeline. Worth watching if you are uncertain of your own interests!",1388275200,2,770,4.703703703703703
4653611,1,B005CKIJFQ,One lie or misrepresentation after another.  The martyred Imperial family was murdered by bloodthirsty barbarians who would bring years of tragedy to the Russian people and the world.  This worthless film might just as well as not have been produced by the demonic Lenin or Stalin. Does not even deserve one star. It is a worthless few minutes of atheist communist propaganda. God Save the Tsar.  May the memory of the Romanoff dynasty live on.,1376438400,8,444,4.8933333333333335
4653612,1,B005CKIJFQ,"Useful only for someone who knows absolutely nothing about Nicholas, Alexandra, and the Romanov family.  Some of the footage is interesting, but this account is only the most general of information.",1364515200,2,198,5.387096774193548
4653613,2,B005CKIJFQ,"Very, very brief, no analysis, no distinction between period film and recreated scenes.  A complete waste of time for anyone who wants real knowledge about the Romanovs.",1363305600,7,169,5.2592592592592595
8465590,1,B005CKIJFQ,"This film is only 10 minutes in length--not worth the price.  Yes, it shows old film footage of the Romanovs.  But it is the same as many other documentaries that I already own.  The information about the finding of the Romanov bodies is wrong, which shows that the film was put together before the last two bodies were found over 10 yrs. ago.",1521331200,,343,4.412698412698413
8465591,5,B005CKIJFQ,"""Czar Nicholas II And The Romanovs"" is a fascinating brief documentary, which provides an overview of the downfall of Czar Nicholas II and the Romanov Dynasty, beginning with the start of World War I, continuing with the Bolshevik Revolution, and ending with the horrifying execution of Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and their five children. The majesty of Saint Petersburg, the Winter Palace, and the Alexander Palace are highlighted in this program, narrated by Leonard Nimoy. I found ""Czar Nicholas II And The Romanovs"" to be a very interesting and informative mini-documentary, which merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1500163200,2,657,5.514851485148514

I don't think the purpose of it is to go into depth or give new information to someone who already knows about the Russian Revolution, but it works perfect for my 10th graders for whom this information is new.",1423094400,3,282,4.423076923076923
