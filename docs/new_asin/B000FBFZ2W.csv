2559206,5,B000FBFZ2W,"We LOVE Sid Caesar and count him among the best comedians ever lived,maybe even the best. Some of his sketches are better then the others( we did not like all his "" professors "" and "" experts"" scenes,but it is not him to blame ,but the authors).
We are fortunate to come across this film. Thanks to the seller's quick delivery we can enjoy it to our hearts's content.",1220140800,9,367,4.333333333333333
2559207,5,B000FBFZ2W,"This is a great DVD. The skits are from start to finish, not just a few seconds. When you see the list of writers from this show, you will be shocked. This was real TV, not reality TV.",1187740800,30,184,3.8684210526315788
2559208,3,B000FBFZ2W,"I bought this to introduce my grandkids (ages 16 and 12)  to Your Show of Shows. I'd have liked less talk, more skits ... and more of Caesar and Coca interacting. The sketch with Howard Morris is a winner.",1357862400,6,205,4.256410256410256
2559209,5,B000FBFZ2W,"Those who might think that a black and white video of a 60 year old TV show cannot produce hysterical laughs are in for a pleasant surprise. I consider Sid Caesar the all time master of television comedy, surpassed only by Chaplin in comedic genius. Hold on to your chair or recliner tightly to keep from falling to the floor. I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could!",1350345600,,368,4.271428571428571
2559210,4,B000FBFZ2W,"Provides some background on how they developed the writing and the shows.  Skits are still funny after all these years.  (and there is no foul language or sex talk, imagine that!)",1313971200,,179,4.741935483870968
2559211,3,B000FBFZ2W,The quality of the DVD was great.  I was disappointed in too few skits and too many interviews.  A DVD product needs to be made ofa 4 disc continuous play of his shows like the one of Jack Benny.,1283644800,10,195,3.9743589743589745

Sid Caesar and his co comedians performed live before there was video taping. They are the original classic cemedians who cannot be duplicated today. No foul language nor coarseness, but just pure comedy that is timeless. This DVD has 8 of his routines, but it has only two in which his famous co-star, Imogene Coco, appears. The quality of the restoration process could have been better.

 The DVD is worth having if only the funniest routine I have ever seen, "" This is your Story,"" was in it. This routine of the parody of ""This is your Life"" is rip roaring comedy at its best.

I would recommend thid DVD to be in one's collection for this type of comedy may never appear again.",1283040000,,844,5.371212121212121

2559215,5,B000FBFZ2W,"We watched this whole set on the weekend, and laughed and laughed. I'm not old enough to remember these shows when they were on but we love glorious black and white. There are interviews and comments by writers and stars like Woody Allen too. One skit involved Nanette Fabray singing an opera while Sid was supposed to be a straight man but things kept going wrong. At one point his false moustache gets tangled in her hair and he puts it back on upside down. We hear from Fabray that this was unplanned, and the incredulous look on her face when she sees the upside down 'stache was real. There are some line blunders too, which we love. This was live TV after all. You'll also like the hyper little Howard ""Ernest T Bass"" Morris in the sketches.",1266105600,9,747,4.420289855072464
