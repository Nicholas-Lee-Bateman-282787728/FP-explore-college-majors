The sexy women were nice to see, but it was disgusting and extremely Satanic. Not in a horror movie kind of way, just evil.
I don't recommend.",1407456000,,243,4.304347826086956
8334348,4,B001PQT3AQ,"Someone lent me the first 2 SATANIC SLUTS dvd`s, and they were OK for a laugh or three if you`re into extreme Goth chicks prancing about in various states of undress w/ large attitudes and little else. Thinking you`re a Vampire, leading slaves around on leashes,self-body piercings and playing make-believe Black Mass and Coven Circles seems rather foolish when you`re on the outside looking in. Strutting around as though you`re on a fashion runway in Hell gets old right quick w/o something else happening, and not much does. That said, with 'SATANIC SLUTS III -SCANDALIZED', Nigel Wingrove has finally pushed the boundaries of his series further out w/ much better results.  This one`s a series of vignettes tied to British Tabloid fodder w/ Voluptua starring (though she can`t act and seems bored and indifferent throughout), w/ a series of dark fantasies and Urban Gothic Legends featuring a bevvy of women content to exploit themselves for the benefit of the viewers. Kudos to the ladies for that. The scenes are explicit girl-on-girl actions, usually involving Masters and Slaves. The enjoyment and delight of each segment is contingent entirely on the viewer`s tastes and fantasies - whatever greases your wheels determines that. But there is enough variation to pretty much ensure that you will enjoy several of the scenarios. Personally, I wasn`t sure I was having fun until the last 2 segments, which brought Satanic Sluts III Redemption for me. I hope Nigel + Co. continue the series and keep pushing the limits of this genre and give us all a heavenly taste of Hell here on Earth.",1267228800,2,1593,4.988721804511278
