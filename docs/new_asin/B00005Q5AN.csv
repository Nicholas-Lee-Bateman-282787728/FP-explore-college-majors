7949674,5,B00005Q5AN,"One of my all time favorite movies. It's a trip down memory lane having grown up in the area this was filmed in. The director really portrayed the scenery well as well as the message. Such a powerful story that these actors portrayed beautifully. Lea Thompson makes the movie for me, but Danny Nucci, and Vincent Spano excel as well. Stephen Spinella plays his role superbly. I would highly recommend this movie.",1426723200,,412,4.736111111111111
