8118267,5,B000F6ZDZ6,"This is a great documentary, and exactly what I expected. I saw a review saying that this was more Indiana Jones then biblical. That's not quite a fair review because this is a documentary on taking a submarine to the bottom of the Dead Sea to search for archaeological remains of Sodom and Gomorrah. That's what it says it is, and that is exactly what it is. I was not expecting it to focus on the Bible story. I already know the Bible story. I was expecting it to be a documentary showing footage of the bottom of the Dead Sea, and the research. That is exactly what it delivered. Well it does touch on the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, and of course lot and his family, the main focus is on the science, and using science to back up the Bible, not to disprove the Bible. This documentary delivered on its promise and was very enjoyable. It also showed the very real struggle of trying to do this type of exploration in the Middle East, and the opposition that comes up against them when trying to search for support of the biblical accounts given.",1521158400,,1049,4.357142857142857

8118269,3,B000F6ZDZ6,"This video is about an expedition to search for ruins of Sodom and Gomorrah beneath the surface of the Dead Sea, using a midget submarine.

There's a somewhat interesting story about how these people put together the expedition and the various obstacles they have to overcome.

If you're expecting stunning revelations, bold confirmation of the Biblical account or at least new insights, you'll be disappointed. Maybe this is a spoiler, but by the time you get to the end, you find that this expedition didn't really find much.

There's some really over-hyped drama about how dangerous this submarine dive is because the water pressure is equivalent to what it would be at twice the depth in the ocean. Sounds ominous ... until they say that they only go down about 200 feet. So it's the equivalent of diving 400 feet in the ocean? I think that's pretty commonplace these days. Oh, and they go on and on about how they are in danger from the Jordanian military. Queue the dramatic music.

Weirdest point: At one point the narrator says that it would be very significant if they could confirm the Biblical account of Sodom and Gomorrah  because, and I don't have the exact quote but the gist of it was, ""no event in the Bible has ever been confirmed"" so this would be the first. What in the world is he talking about? All sorts of events in the Bible have been confirmed by secular history and archaeology, from the Babylonian Captivity to the building of Herod's temple. Numerous people mentioned in the Bible are known from other sources, from Caesar Augustus to King David. For a video that presented itself as scholarly and from a Christian perspective, this was a stunning gaff. To me anyway.",1465084800,6,1696,4.716216216216216
8118270,1,B000F6ZDZ6,"Remnants of the cities have already been found around the dead sea. There is plenty of other archaeology that supports the Biblical record.  Though it was interesting that they went to the bottom of the dead sea they found nothing at all. Just some salty mounds. Waste of time at best, disinformation at worst.",1464480000,,310,4.7407407407407405
8118271,4,B000F6ZDZ6,"Does this film answer all of the questions about Sodom and Gomorrah? No, but I still love this film and the type of videos where they bring science and/or archaeology to confirm biblical stories. If you love these types of videos, check out these other amazing films.

8118272,5,B000F6ZDZ6,"Oh, this was a GREAT show.  Going under the dead sea was incredible to say the least.  I learned a lot, and the movie verified the truths of the bible.",1365465600,,151,4.0
8118273,2,B000F6ZDZ6,"This work is more for ""Indiana Jones"" fans than for Bible lovers.  The focus is on archaeology and forensics, not religion.  The work tries to add to the excitement by speaking of how difficult it is to get something to float in the Dead Sea and how tensions between Jordan and Israel had effects upon the research.

Most importantly, this work tries to avoid homophobia.  Because the Sodom story has caused unfortunate oppression that me and many others find tragic and unnecessary, the work never says the g-word or the h-word.  They describe Sodom as a ""wicked"" city and suggest it was destroyed for ""decadence""; the narrator never once says the word ""sodomy.""  At times they show a male torso being caressed by one hand that has jewelry and one hand that does not.  So it hints at rainbow flag dynamics, but so subtly that some may miss it.

This work may frustrate many as it is VERY speculative and somewhat anti-climactic.  The work begins by boasting, ""This is the first time that any research crew has gone to the bottom of the Dead Sea.""  Still, like Geraldo Rivera's look into the Mafia, there is hollowness here.  There's this stupid documentary that tries to prove Amazons existed by finding a little girl in Mongolia with blonde hair.  This work has similar picking for straws and stretching things to the nth degree.  I am confident that many viewers will be sorely disappointed.",1210291200,3,1394,4.734439834024896
