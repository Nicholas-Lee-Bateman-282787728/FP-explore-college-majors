2672889,5,B000JJSD1A,"This DVD is a must have for people with dogs.  I've had dogs my entire life and was still able to extract a lot of information from this DVD.  This is the proper way to train your dog/puppy.  It's based on establishing a relationship with your animal that is based on a praise/reward system and teaching your dog who is the ""alpha"" in the household....which would be YOU and not your dog.  This is a great step by step program, and it will work as long as you take the time and make the commitment to work with your animal.  My dog was pretty well behaved before the program, and is an amazing dog since she's been thru it.  The time spent working the program has been a fantastic bonding experience for both of us.  This DVD should be issued for everyone that adopts a puppy - it's a definate ""must have"" for those of us who love our dogs and want nothing but the best for them.",1169251200,18,879,4.196428571428571
2672890,5,B000JJSD1A,"The best friend in the world is a decently trained dog; the worst pest is a poorly trained one. Unfortunately, it seems that the latter group is far more common.

I found this DVD when I noticed a surprising change in a friend's dog,and asked her about it. The dog had been a dog pound rescuee, and a wreck. Jumping around, not paying attention, barking, not walking on a lead. She had tried to work with it and had bought the Dog Whisperer video and some books, but no results that I could see. I saw it a few months later (she lives in a different city), and could hardly believe it was the same dog. She attributed the change to training she had done based on this DVD, and loaned it to me. Pretty impressive!

This is a step-by-step guide to civilizing a dog (in a nice way). The dogs featured are all rescue dogs, and are about as wild and rowdy as you'd expect. Over time, you see them shaping up week-by-week. By the end, they are out for walks, meet other dogs and people, sit quietly while the owner talks,then walk quietly. They come when called, lie down next to other dogs, and generally behave like mannerly friends. It is surprising, but I saw it myself with my friend's dog. I will say she worked with her dog every day, which is what is strongly suggested in this DVD. Apparently, there is a 21-page downloadable workbook/study program too, which I did not see.

This is not obedience work as such, just a good step-by-step program for regular people on how to turn a crazy ill-mannered dog into a nice friend. Recommended,if your dog isn't what you want it to be. Or maybe even if it is..",1161561600,24,1605,4.361204013377926

8151171,5,B000JJSD1A,This is us in this video.  The poodle and the bulldog were mine.  The bulldog was originally aggressive towards other dogs.  She became an excellent obedience dog.  The poodle was rather shy and did not usually venture out to new places.  He became much more confident.  I am getting this video to see my old friends again.,1412294400,,323,4.578947368421052
8151172,3,B000JJSD1A,"Pros: The trainers and techniques are good. I  like the program's structure, including the seven-week schedule with homework. Also, the producers help rescues and the pet community overall.

Cons: The continuous-loop music is terribly annoying. I wish I could turn it off, but then I wouldn't hear the presenters. In the introduction, there is a custodian cleaning behind the presenter. I wonder why this was allowed in the final production. Also - and this is important - these techniques don't incorporate marker training.

Bottom Line: I have other training videos that I watch over and over (the advantage of a DVD), but the musical-loop on this one is terribly annoying. It reminds me of  a computer-generated video game musical loop. Also, while marker training is fairly new to me, I have experienced its effectiveness - and I prefer marker training. Other reviewers obviously love this video, you may love it too. But I didn't.",1365206400,,935,5.0519480519480515
8151173,5,B000JJSD1A,"Our Good Dog was a great tool that we used in training our pit bulls.  My family does pit bull rescue, many other techniques and classes we tried were confusing not only us, but the dogs.  This DVD made it easy for us to make noticable progress week by week.  Our 2 personal pit bulls completed their Canine Good Citizen test last summer with the help of these training skills.  Bindi and Smiley are currently working on their T.O.U.C.H. therapy certificates and plan to do work in nursing homes and inner city school programs.  Thank you, Our Good Dog, for helping me to train such great breed ambassadors.",1233187200,2,607,4.583333333333333
8151174,5,B000JJSD1A,"I have a strong background in serious obedience work, and am rarely impressed with the silly ""train your pet without hurting its feelings"" stuff that is around. This well-produced product is different. It is a solid step-by-step method of of socializing and motivating an untrained dog to act like a responsible canine citizen. For most pet owners, it is all they will ever need.

Recommended.",1233014400,9,393,5.046153846153846
8151175,5,B000JJSD1A,"I found this dvd to be quite helpful.  It's not a quick and easy fix - you and your dog have to work at it - but the results are astounding!  I had a well-behaved (mostly) dog to begin with, but she was hard to walk (pulling, going in a different direction, etc).  After following the steps in this dvd, I was able to turn Cleopatra into a joy to walk.  With a little more training using the methods set out in this dvd, she was able to pass her Canine Good Citizen test and is now an ambassador for the American Pit Bull Terrier breed.

I highly recommend this dvd.",1231977600,11,566,4.063063063063063
8151176,5,B000JJSD1A,"The methods and tatics used in this video work great. I have three dogs all of whom have been certified as Canine Good Citizens, and two of them who will soon be certified therapy dogs all based on the training methods in this DVD. I have great photos from training with the instructor on this DVD with 8 dogs ranging from 7 months old to 4 years all sitting by each other with distractions, but not moving a muscle. Obviously the one star bashing review on here hasn't made it to that point with her pup, but stay with it and be consistant the methods are proven over and over again. Oh by the way all of my dogs who are CGC certified and all the dogs in my training class were Pit Bulls or Pit Bull Mixes, maybe that other reviewer's dogs aren't as smart as my PITTIES!!!",1231977600,5,773,4.194630872483222
8151177,1,B000JJSD1A,This was obviously a pathetic attempt to show how to train your new puppy or dog.  However these dogs were already trained so it was totally unrealistic.  How many pups do you know sit next to other dogs without moving whatsoever.  Don't waste your money.,1231718400,,255,4.622222222222222
8151178,5,B000JJSD1A,"I bought this product because my new best friend was a wild man! He is a 2 year old pit bull mix I adopted from a rescue group. He jumped, pulled on the leash, and wouldn't listen at all. Within 3 days he was walking nicely on the leash, and was paying attention. Now my friends are just amazed at how well mannered he is and are eaten up with dog envy! He sits and downs with just hand signals!!!!

It takes work, and time and following the directions, but I cannot be happier with the results! He is really my best friend now, and a pleasure to be with and live with. I wish there was a follow up video for advanced stuff, but we are going to try to get the Canine Good Citizen in the spring. A great product!",1224979200,5,711,4.007042253521127
8151179,5,B000JJSD1A,This book has been very helpful for us and does work if you put the time in training your dog.,1203724800,5,94,3.75
