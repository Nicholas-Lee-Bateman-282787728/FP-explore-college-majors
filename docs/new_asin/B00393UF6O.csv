8391919,3,B00393UF6O,"So this is porn.... Just throwing that out there. I didn't realize that when I ordered it, because the description and the cover art led me to believe it was some sort of anime demon monster battle over the earth. So imagine my surprise when I watched it with some friends and realized that not only was this tentacle porn, but it was one of the very first, and essentially started that genre. I'm conflicted because, the animation was pretty good, and the story minus the brutal rape and beastiality was decent, fast paced, and funny in places. But still it contains brutal rape, beastiality and possible incest... Also despite being the shortened more censored version, (all the new DVD versions are.) it's still for the most part explicit, and violent, tentacle/rape porn. If you're into that kind of thing, or curious and desensitized, this movie would be more enjoyable. If not it can be fairly traumatizing. It's a difficult movie to explain, also the main girl everyone tries to get with looks like she's 14...... Just saying.",1464307200,3,1033,4.808988764044944

8391921,1,B00393UF6O,First off since no one else has taken the time to point this out..  This is not uncensored the run time is only 108 mins meaning 72 minutes of this movie is missing..  Still a great movie but I am used to the full version since I used to own the entire collection on vhs.. Was really disappointed to find out this was the cut up version..  Really wish people would specify such things so buyers like myself would know before we spent our hard earned dollars..,1454976000,16,459,4.252873563218391
8391922,4,B00393UF6O,"Replaced my vhs of this with the dvd. Groundbreaking anime. The dvd had a small skip while playing that was irritating, but tolerable. My favorite character is Mao O (sic?) the demon of the ocean - but he's no match for the Overfiend. Its also cool that they show Sui Kakuju (sic?) in multiple guises.",1439510400,5,301,4.490909090909091

8391924,2,B00393UF6O,"First, I want to say that absolutely no one under 18 should ever watch this anime as it does contain very disturbing violence and violent sexual situations; and I'm definitely against that element in Urotsukidoji.

This aside, there are some pretty good story and character elements in this anime.  In UROTSUKIDOJI III: RETURN OF THE OVERFIEND, the son of deceased Nazi scientist, Munihausen Jr. is reborn as Faust; an insane mephistophelean wizard hell-bent on conquering the world following the collapse of the three dimensions.  He works alongside the psychopathic cybernetic leader Caesar to kill the super-god Overfiend before he controls the post apocalyptic planet.  Along the way, unlikely alliances form, and betrayal meets a violent end.

Some cool things going on here are the young Caesar conjuring the Overfiend only to try and destroy him and Faust battling the anti-hero Amano Jyaku during a nuclear missile strike.  As with much of the series, Amano Masamichi does a great job making a powerful musical score.

Though Urotsukidoji III is better than Legend of the Demon Womb, it doesn't compare to the first anime; Legend of the Overfiend which has the best art, music, animation, story and development.  If Legend of the Overfiend were tamed down a bit, it'd make a great live action film.  Look at the run of the mill garbage Hollywood keeps churning out and tell me they're not hurting for good ideas.",1199750400,7,1420,5.034188034188034
