I wonder how many more are there going to be;  The wealthy owners of manufacturing companies make millions off of a conflict that will go on for years to come.  It will take years for our country to wake up and help the Donald drain the swamp of big spenders in Washington.  The former president George Bush, The Glenn Marchionson  of Dallas, Texas .Former President Linden Baines Johnson (all wealth oil men)who was one of the conspirators in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  The body in his grave is Dallas Policeman J.D. Tibbett who was shot and killed by CIA's  G. Gordon Liddy two hours before Kennedy in Dallas.  They needed his brain to  replace Kennedy's.  It would be nice to exhume the body in President Kennedy's grave and expose a horrible conspiracy.
  So, a nice guy like Patrick goes to Afghanistan and his own men shot him to death.  The quality of life he and his lovely wife was forfeited willingly.  I respect him for what he did.  I wonder if there was not a lot more to the cover up that we will never know about his death.  What a tragedy.  With all due respect;

intellectual issues around Pat Tillman's death in Afghanistan and
subsequent Army cover-up. A film of insight, humanity, and righteous
anger, but it never feels manipulative of the people or facts involved.

Like Tillman himself, it avoids simplistic answers and tries to look
deeper. This isn't a propaganda piece, but a complex study of a
family's grief, and how powerful organizations like the Army sometimes
put their own image ahead of human honesty and decency.

Tillman himself emerges as a highly complex man - someone who didn't go
off to war looking for glory, and indeed, tried actively just to be
treated like any other soldier - a desire the Army refused to honor,
even in death (Tillman had specifically, in writing. requested not to
have a military funeral should he die in war, but the Army tried to
bulldoze the family into one for PR purposes).

He believed the Afghanistan war was a righteous cause, but politically
disagreed with the decision to go to war with Iraq, while fighting with
honor and distinction. He was an atheist who respected and was curious
about all religions, and whose public memorial was co-opted by public
figures invoking the name of God, until finally his little brother - in
an act of slightly drunken bravery - stood up to tell them all that
wasn't who Pat was.

His family emerge as heroes of another kind, working tirelessly to
discover the truth of what really happened to their son and why,all the
while fighting an Army and political establishment that just wanted
them to stand there mute, and look sad and grateful for the cameras.

Amir Bar-Lev is emerging as one of our best documentary filmmakers, and
I'd urge you to also check out his earlier work ""My Kid Could Paint
That"" and ""Fighter"".",1447545600,,1809,4.8603896103896105
