2183631,5,B0006GAOKY,"Strauss is my very favorite of the Composer series. I didn't know he had a brother who was also a composer. The storyline about him helping the stable boy was intriguing. There also seemed to be a little sibling rivalry between him and his brother. The mother was trying to get Mr. Strauss to compose at home but he chose to compose at the Duchess' home instead where he met the stable boy and his mother.

When the boy's stepfather was finally arrested for trying to sell an expensive brooch of the Duchess and substitute a cheap paste copy after his stepson caught him, I thought I detected a little chemistry between Strauss and the mother. That was not the purpose of the story though so it just left one wondering.

I also never knew just how many wonderful waltzes that Johann Strauss wrote. The Vienna Woods one that he composed supposedly in the Duchess' honor was so pretty and according to the story, the boy blowing on his horn in the woods gave him the idea at least for the introduction.

Very good movie and all will like it I'm sure.",1175731200,2,1048,4.447916666666667

8041549,1,B0006GAOKY,"As a film it's just sort of mediocre, but as a source of information about Strauss, it's terrible. It barely teaches ANYTHING about Strauss. I wanted to use it in my music classroom, but it's just not worth the time.",1456272000,,216,4.425

8041551,3,B0006GAOKY,"Small story focusing to much on development of the actions, thoughts of the characters. With this exiting Historical and Artistic figure like Mr. Strauss the film team should have done a better job. The idea behind was reasonable but execution is weak.",1446768000,,252,5.023809523809524

8041554,2,B0006GAOKY,"OK.. So what is this DVD all about? A children's fantasy tale? I wish they had made it clear before I put my money down on it.
Why the second star? Lovely performance and recording of music, especially in the extras. Ondrej Leonard excels.

Otherwise, this DVD is quite a sham. I have no idea if this story really happened, and I don't think it really did. What the heck were the producers thinking? If this is what the rest of the series is all about, then PLEASE DO NOT BUY IT, and the rest of the series which I think will be as putrid as this,  unless you want to weave fantasies about what composers were 'supposed' to be all about. Their Mother Theresa (OR a fictional St. Cecile) kind of characters that this movie tries to convey is of the sort that any child of normal intelligence and perception will not believe, and those with just one point above average perception will not believe and may even ridicule.
Absolutely Lousy.
UNLESS
You are trying to replicate an Enid Blyton kind of a story.... with set caricatures of what composers, countesses, thieves and wife beaters and child abusers are all about.
My advise to all those people who want a perspective on J StraussII is, AVOID LIKE PLAGUE... or HIV+ve. This is a children's story without a historic base..
PLEASE AVOID, unless you wish to hear the extras of music conducted by Lenard. But you can buy the CD as well for that. What a disappointment.",1304640000,2,1416,4.505836575875486
8041555,5,B0006GAOKY,"The music is lovely, the acting is quite good but, be aware that  this is purely a little fictional tale of Johann Strauss.  If you are a Strauss historian or a serious collector then this is not the movie for you.  If you want to spend $$ to add to your collection of Strauss (rare to find a Strauss video) then by all means get this.

The 2 disc set of Strauss (A&E production) is closer to a biography with a lot of discrepancies but as I said above better than nothing.  The music in both of them of course, it pure Strauss!!!",1250812800,6,530,4.106796116504855
8041556,5,B0006GAOKY,i already owned this in vhs format. i wanted a dvd copy. it arrived early and in perfect condiion. thanks! jb,1235433600,,109,4.238095238095238
8041557,3,B0006GAOKY,"Although the music is wonderful in this movie, I hesitate to show this to younger students.  It really discusses the issue of wife/child abuse and stealing more so than Strauss's music.  The wife and child in this movie are beaten by the husband (although it doesn't show it exactly, it is hinted).  Strauss and the boy also talk through this abuse.  It also does mention a ""beer hole.""  I prefer the Liszt and Handel videos in this series to show to students - nothing questionable and more entertaining.",1231113600,4,505,4.693181818181818
