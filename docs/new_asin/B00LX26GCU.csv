""Merlin's Apprentice"" is shown in two parts, making it a three hour movie, which is too long for me and probably for a lot of other people.  The action sequences make up for it.",1481673600,,351,4.46875

8668659,1,B00LX26GCU,"Dont be fooled by the cover art.  This is not a set of C.G. or animated movies.  It showed up for me as a recommendation along with other animated sci-fi and fantasy movies.  It is definitely no such thing.  This is a set of C movie live action movies from the 60s or 70s with horrible plots and even worse production values.  I watched about 10 minutes of the first one on the disk, and when a monkey was sitting in a kings throne with a kings robe, I turned it off.  Its too bad because the cover looked like it might be similar to the Final Fantasy series.  I think that is what they were counting on.  Luckily it was only $10.00, so it didn't set me back too much.",1444089600,2,668,4.0458015267175576
