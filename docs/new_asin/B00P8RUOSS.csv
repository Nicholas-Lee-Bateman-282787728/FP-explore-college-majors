8686975,5,B00P8RUOSS,"Fantastic old silent. Lots of action. A good intro to people who have never seen a silent film. Too bad John Gilberts star faded after the advent of talkies, he was truly a great actor.",1474848000,,185,4.314285714285714
8686976,3,B00P8RUOSS,"Based on a Tolstoy novel, this late, big-budget silent starring matinee idol John Gilbert has worn fairly well, though the problems that plagued production, resulting in numerous rewrites, re-shooting, and director changes, are apparent in the way the final product seems rather strained.  John Gilbert plays a Cossack youth who is scorned by his family, fellows, and sweet-heart for rejecting the manly arts of fighting, until, stung by his father's reproaches, he turns warrior and wins the girl.  The film is especially notable for the meticulous detail of the Czarist Russian setting, and for some spectacular equestrian stunts, performed according to the box's cover by genuine Cossack horsemen.  Consider it four stars if you are especially interested in Gilbert, Cossacks, silents, or stunt riding; three stars for the average viewer. The Warner Archive Collection DVD has a good orchestral score composed especially for this release; the audio is very good, and the video a very good transfer of a print that seems generally good, though splotchy in places.",1449964800,6,1065,5.3273809523809526
8686977,5,B00P8RUOSS,"This is a precious, realistic portrayal of Ukrainian village life in this specific time period. The wedding scene and music are absolutely correct. So glad it is available on DVD!",1422057600,6,179,5.0
8686978,3,B00P8RUOSS,"The Cossacks,"" based on the Leo Tolstoy novel, is a romantic adventure from 1928 starring the silent screens famed Great Lover, John Gilbert. He plays Lukashka, son of a Cossack chieftain, who would rather flirt with his sweetheart, Maryana (Renee Adoree), than battle the rival Turks. Regarded as a coward for his peace-loving ways, he is mocked by his fellow villagers and rejected by Maryana. The young Cossack proves he has a backbone when he outrides and overwhelms enemy Turks who stole his villages horses. But he also faces a romantic rival  a czarist prince (Nils Asther) intent on marrying Maryana.

MGM co-starred Gilbert and Adoree to capitalize on their successful pairing in The Big Parade. George Hill directed most of the picture, with Clarence Brown coming in to finish it. Though most of the contemporary reviews were positive and the film features some exciting action sequences, Gilbert was unhappy with it and it marked the beginning of a downward spiral for the MGM silent star.

There are no bonus extras on the DVD release.",1417046400,5,1047,4.9714285714285715
