8489145,5,B005Y5NOSQ,"Yorkshire Television has produced the best of all available versions of Priestley's classic 1929 novel, ""The Good Companions.""  I say ""available"" because the 1975 Johnny Mercer and Andre Previn London musical was never filmed and is sadly all but forgotten. (I have the original cast recording and it is superb.) Those who have read the book will appreciate the pains that Yorkshire took in staying true to the Dickensian plot of the original.  All ten principal characters get their just recognition as the story moves through perhaps fifty or more scenes. If I had one complaint it would be that the musical numbers which were not part of the stage company's performances seemed out of place in the 21st century; folks today are looking for realism not operetta. And perhaps it doesn't give the intriguing romantic relationship between Inigo and Susie the attention it deserves. But these are minor quibbles when set against the opulence of this production. Fans of the novel will not be disappointed. The '33 and '57 film versions are no match for the presentation. (Note: I played the three DVDs on my computer. Most modern computers have a software switch that permits you to select the different regional formats in which to play a DVD. Afterwards you can reset it to Region 1. Careful though--you can only use this switch four times!)",1355443200,,1341,4.929203539823009
