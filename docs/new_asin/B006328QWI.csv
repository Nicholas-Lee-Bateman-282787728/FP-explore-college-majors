4934270,3,B006328QWI,"Andrea Arnold's Heathcliff is sort of a bastard.  Not in the sense that nothing is known of his lineage -- he's just a downright selfish and obstinate bastard.  Of course, in Emily Bronte's novel, he ultimately becomes one, bitter and jaded by the loss of Catherine, the object of his refuted affections, and seeks revenge upon those whom he feels have wronged him.  That mostly happens in the second half of the novel, however, in which Heathcliff manipulates the fates of the succeeding generation in a fairly scathing commentary on the ideas of monarchy, hegemony, propriety, and class.  Most film adaptations omit that rather sizable chunk of the novel in favor of the star-crossed lovers plot that dominates the first half, and Arnold's is no exception.  What distinguishes her version of Wuthering Heights is the idea of The Other in the Hegelian sense of the term, of the master-slave dialectic; it is this intrinsic Otherness that motivates her Heathcliff, even going so far as to imply that his desire for Catherine was borne not out of romantic passion but rather a more simple, self-preserving instinct predicated upon her compassion for this acceded stray.

As such, it must be addressed immediately that this is the first production of Wuthering Heights to employ a black actor in the role of Heathcliff -- in fact it employs two: Solomon Glave as the younger Heathcliff and James Howson as the older.  Neither is given very much dialogue, which is another point of distinction for Arnold's unique telling of this story.  This is undoubtedly the most tactile adaptation of Wuthering Heights yet.  The weather has always played a prominent role in the story, but never has it been so palpable.  One feels the sheer force of the elements weighing down upon the characters; it is easy to understand why simply surviving could be considered such an accomplishment on the moors.

Arnold's attention to the landscape, not as a distant backdrop but as a living organism within arm's reach, brings to mind the work of Terrence Malick; much like the fields of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Days-of-Heaven-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B003152YXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Days of Heaven (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>] or the jungles of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thin-Red-Line-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B003KGBIRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thin Red Line (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>], the moors of Wuthering Heights communicate more about the characters' priorities than the dialogue, illuminating their most basic motivations and concerns.  Heathcliff is shown gently touching the flora, diligently digging the earth, and stolidly breaking stone, more in communion with the ground below and the sky above than with the humans circumjacent to him.

Heathcliff is first shown compassion when Mr. Earnshaw (Paul Hilton) takes him into his home, but it is of the Christian ""Now I can make you one of my own"" variety.  He is treated like an animal -- and explicitly called as much -- by the rest of the Earnshaws, save for Catherine (Shannon Beer, and later Kaya Scodelario), who herself seems to be an outsider among her family.  Whereas everyone else tries to ""civilize"" Heathcliff, Catherine instead tries to understand and to relate with him.  She appeals to his senses, teaching him the different birds by the touch of their feathers.  They go horseback riding together, Heathcliff rapturously inhaling the scent of her billowing hair and luxuriating in the gentle rocking of their bodies against one another.  They share their first -- and most -- intimate moment pinning one another down in the mud.

Discounting these fleeting moments, however, Heathcliff is staunchly entrenched as The Other.  Even before Mr. Earnshaw dies and his eldest son Hindley (Lee Shaw) condemns Heathcliff to the stables, Heathcliff spends much of his time lurking around corners and peering through windows.  Much of the film is shot through small openings or vantages otherwise obstructed -- holes in the wall, doors left ajar, filthy windows, overgrown brush -- giving one the feeling of a voyeur, spying upon a world of which one is not a part.

It is in fact an explicitly voyeuristic act perpetrated by Heathcliff and Catherine which will ultimately drive them apart.  Gawking through the windows of the nearby Linton estate, curious of how the other half lives, Heathcliff and Catherine are spotted by the Lintons who, startled, release their dogs upon them.  Catherine's foot is badly bitten, and the Lintons, realizing that she is just a girl, take her in to care for her.  Heathcliff, however, is sent away for his crude and vulgar demeanor, an attribute they claim of his having been an orphan from the streets of Liverpool.

This interaction highlights what is perhaps Heathcliff's defining trait and greatest flaw: that of his priggish adherence to the label of The Other, which he wears as a foolish, spiteful, and wholly misguided point of pride.  This is where the issue of Heathcliff's race becomes pertinent, and it is worth reiterating the fact that the Lintons ascribe him the status of The Other based upon his actions and not his appearance.  Hindley, however, refers to Heathcliff as ""n----r"" several times throughout the film; to wit, even Catherine spits on Heathcliff when she first sees him.  As such, Heathcliff believes that as long as he is dark skinned, he will always be viewed as a savage, as unclean; he resists his baptism when he is first welcomed into Mr. Earnshaw's home, and even insists ""I like being dirty"" when it is suggested he bathe for company.  To Heathcliff, his own blackness is an irreversible stain on his character, making any attempts at gentility not only futile but a sign of weakness and of subservience.

When Catherine marries Edgar Linton (James Northcote), Heathcliff -- at least in Arnold's telling of the story -- is maddened less by the loss of a potential lover than by the loss of compassion.  He views Catherine's acceptance of marriage as a concession to the hierarchical system of caste and manners of which he is an outsider and to which he professes no fealty.  Arnold even allows Catherine some concordant misgivings of her own; ""He's handsome, cheerful, and rich -- and he loves me,"" she asserts, before doubling back and confiding, ""Wherever souls live, I feel I'm wrong.""

Heathcliff, rather than confronting Catherine, runs away.  When he returns several years later, he is in possession of some degree of wealth -- the source of which is undisclosed -- which he uses to secure room and board for a year in the Earnshaw house, during which time he will reinstate himself in Catherine's life.  This is, unfortunately, where Arnold starts to lose her grip on the story, and the final act doesn't quite gel.  Arnold is clearly trying to develop a conflict between Heathcliff's passion for Catherine and his vengeful greed, but she tilts the scales too much in favor of the latter to keep the audience emotionally invested.  Her Heathcliff simply has too few redeeming characteristics for us to want to see him succeed; he is selfish, insensitive, petulant, and manipulative.

In fact, most of our sympathies end up with Isabella (Nichola Burley), Catherine's sister-in-law whose attraction to Heathcliff makes her an unfortunate pawn in his conquest for Catherine's affections.  Burley's may actually be the film's strongest performance; Isabella's is certainly the most fully realized emotional arc, even as it all unfolds within the film's final act.  It is through Heathcliff's treatment of her that we are able to more clearly understand his motives with Catherine.  The film ends by revisiting an earlier scene of Heathcliff and Catherine frolicking, in which Heathcliff eventually pins her down to the ground; what had earlier come across as playful now feels more like an act of dominance.  Heathcliff's steady gaze, which had originally seemed intimate and loving, now reads as self satisfaction, pleased at having found someone with whom he can reverse the roles of master and slave.

Arnold deserves plaudits for intent -- I rather like this interpretation of Heathcliff, even if it does compromise the film's ability to engage the viewer -- and for technical execution.  Robbie Ryan, who has also worked on Arnold's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Road/dp/B000Q7ZKX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Road</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fish-Tank-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B004CIIXFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fish Tank (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>], deserves extra special mention for the film's poetic and evocative cinematography.  His unfussy compositions, smooth rack focuses across the vast moors, and control of atmosphere and light give the film a gravity that the script cannot.  I still admire Arnold's perspective and her control of mood, but ultimately Wuthering Heights suffers from the same lack of narrative momentum and thematic focus that, for me at least, crippled Arnold's previous film Fish Tank.  That film was, puzzlingly, almost universally adored for its stark depiction of the British lower class; Wuthering Heights at least has a little more to say, even if it struggles to get it all out.

4934271,5,B006328QWI,"From a film student's perspective, this film was utterly gorgeous. Though I've never read the book, I have to say that Wuthering Heights turned into a great film. The cinematography is flawless, with raw visuals and close ups, and the dynamic between the characters pulls you in instantly. The story is tragic and perfect, especially considering the backstory and historical context. Andrea Arnold is amazing and has crafted this story with her own interpretation and perception of the characters' realities. Amazing!",1363046400,5,517,5.395061728395062
4934272,5,B006328QWI,"While it does not follow the book, this adaptation of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights is entirely worthy of the original. Wuthering Heights is one of my favorite novels and this film captures the raw essence of it, which means this film will not appeal to a wide audience. The story is essentially about people who have had harsh lives and who have no qualms about hurting people, even the people they love. It's set in a barren landscape with little to entertain. The film reflects this with little dialogue and the sound of the wind rushing across the moors makes up the film's soundtrack until the entirely appropriate Mumford and Son's ""Enemy"" comes on with the credits. There is very little, if any, artificial lighting, which leaves much of what happens inside in shadow. Scenes with animal cruelty are also a notable part of the film and while I hate to see a dog hanged by its collar, that's one of the scenes from the book I will never forget and serves to help detract people's typically over-romantic notions of Heathcliff. All in all, this film created an incredible atmosphere for Cathy and Heathcliff's part of the story.",1357516800,36,1136,4.742424242424242
4934273,3,B006328QWI,"A cinematographic adaptation, not merely a film adaptation, if that makes any sense - not just a filmed reading of excerpts from the book in historic settings. Dialogue is largely replaced by tableaux, to powerful effect, and the wuthering wind becomes a character in its own right, fairly choking us in some scenes. This adaptation chooses to focus on the theme of obsessive love, while almost entirely ignoring the theme of revenge.",1353974400,19,434,5.041666666666667
4934274,4,B006328QWI,"This production is a real mixed bag. It is beautifully inspired film-craft in regards to cinematography, location, direction and acting (especially from the younger actor and actress playing Heathcliff and Catherine).

The director Andrea Arnold has lovingly understood and rendered Emily Bronte's masterpiece in a truer sense than I've ever seen previously in film adaptations. Her affinity with the novel is obvious in the extreme devotion to the nuances that other films always seem to miss. Specifically, and most importantly is location. Wuthering heights, Thrushcross Grange, and most especially the moors are such integral parts of this story and so representational that the importance of location cannot be over-estimated. Arnold's shots of the moors put the audience perfectly in the setting. Breathtaking images of the moors leave the viewer able to fully comprehend the isolation the characters would feel in such a desolate landscape. Which is then contrasted to the more populated and cheerful Thruscross Grange. Catherine and Heathcliff's bond is indigenous to the fierce and uncultivated land of the moors. Arnold's adaptation is unparalleled in expressing this deeper understanding of the story.

She does a fine job with Catherine and Heathcliff's younger years. Solomon Glave and Shannon Beer gave heart-wrenching and profound performances, all the more remarkable given their tender ages. Glave's performance was remarkable. I believed in their love on screen, as surely as I did when I read the novel. However, the entire production goes belly up in the last third of film. The replacement of the characters with older actors betrays the powerful beauty and chemistry that was so painstakingly created by Beer and Glave. Kaya Scodelario and James Howson are both competent actors, but they did not earn the emotions they were pretending to as the younger actors had. Their appearance was too jarringly different. By the time they make it onscreen, Beer and Glave had already stole the show.

Given that only three and half years pass in the novel between the time Catherine Marries Edgar and Heathcliff's return, the changeup of actors was even more senseless and inappropriate. But beyond this complaint, the rest of the story is wrapped up so quickly once the adult actors are brought in, that much of the story is missed. Heathcliff's revenge on Hindley, his reconstruction of his own trauma on Hareton, and his plot for Cathy and Linton are all forgotten about.

This adaptation is superb in many ways, but fails in important aspects as well. I could not imagine watching this if I had not read the book. It would be incomprehensible and strange. Upon reflection as to why there has never been a generally accepted film adaptation for this story - I don't think it's possible. So much of the novel relies on narration. The narration of the ever boring Mr. Lockwood is a device for Nelly Dean to narrate the tale. It's Nelly Dean that makes the story human and digestible. She is not an unreliable narrator, but she is an incredibly biased narrator. In a sense, she raised Catherine and Heathcliff. Catherine and Heathcliff are detestable characters. They are selfish, narcissistic, and cruel. They are unlovable, yet Nelly loves them. Nelly forgives them. Nelly's narration softens and distills their harshness for the reader. However Nelly is never realized as a fully developed character in any of the film adaptations.

This is a beautiful film with excellent cinematography. And while the directory clearly appreciates the story and captures real bits of the story with brilliance, she lets others important bits fall by the wayside, so that you have crystal clear snippets, but not the entire story in its full breathtaking splendor. What is captured is truer to the grisliest bits of the novel that are traditionally ignored in adaptations. It is a vindicating adaptation for anyone whose ever shaken their head in frustration when people romanticize Wuthering Heights or Heathcliff. This adaptation has glaring flaws and is difficult to digest, yet I'd recommend it to anyone else who is an avid fan of the novel, but not to newcomers and certainly not to people who enjoy standard period piece costume dramas.",1353024000,45,4242,5.159883720930233
4934275,2,B006328QWI,"Those three Bront sisters certainly knew about religious hypocrisy and alcoholism. To judge by their output, those issues hung heavy on their poor heads. Just look at their work:
  * Emily - Wuthering Heights;
  * Charlotte - Jane Eyre;
  * Anne - The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.

Not one of these is exactly sunshine and lollipops, is it!

This new version written and directed by Andrea Arnold is unrelentingly gloomy with intermittent shocks (killing a sheep in living color, snapping a snared rabbit's neck, hanging a couple of dogs and leaving them struggling) mingled with senseless scenes that started for no reason, went nowhere, and then stopped.

If I hadn't read the book, I think I would have been utterly bewildered; as it was, I was just angry. We spent most of the movie on the first third of the book in which we saw Heathcliff as a boy from...maybe the Caribbean? Cathy is still a brainless self-centered vamp, and she is still just as obsessed with Heathcliff as he with her.

I did NOT like:
  * The dim, hazy production,
  * The unrelenting cruelty,
  * The herky jerky hand-held camera work,
  * The clichd indictment of those villainous Christians,
  * The rainy muddy production,
  * The occasional lag which would prompt bucolic interludes with moths, butterflies, birds, dogs and horses.

Yes, I'm aware that this entry to the 2012 Seattle International Film Festival from the UK, is an artistic work that has won numerous technical awards, but it certainly withered our hearts!

4934306,4,B006328QWI,"I was greatly disappointed by the lack of personality and chemistry among the characters. However, this movie is beautifully, cinematically shot, but just be ready for a gratuitous amount of landscape and mood-setting shots. The movie sets up a unique context for the plot where Heathcliff is biracial instead of a gypsy. Heathcliff is not beloved by Mr. Earnshaw like I've seen in previous adaptations. Also, the Earnshaw's comparatively low social status in relation to their neighbors is more apparent. I just wish that the characters were more exciting.",1489968000,,557,5.269662921348314

4934308,2,B006328QWI,"Worst version of Wuthering Heights ever. For several reasons. My top one is that Heathcliff was not black. He was Romany who are related to the Indians/Hindu. I don't care for the political spin by making him black. Black people are not the only race in the world who have suffered abuse.  My second, which is related to the first, is that by making him black they have made it seem like Heathcliff was owed what he schemed for. They watered down his character to garner sympathy for him. The character of Heathcliff was certainly abused but he was much darker. More diabolical. Maybe for an instant, one might have sympathy for Heathcliff, but later he certainly rips any compassion from your beating breast and beats it bloody and then consumes it raw. He not only becomes like his abusers but transcends them. This version did not nearly do him justice. I believe that is because of the political bias. A black Heathcliff cannot be evil but must garner sympathy. They ruined it.",1487376000,6,981,4.670520231213873

What they do say tends to not mean anything. If someone was to say something that meant something it was surely omitted because opooh pretty nature. For example, During what is one of the greatest monologues in english literature the camera instead follows heath cliff walking around outside well out of ear shot.

 Being uninitiated to the source material my girlfriend had to narrarate what she thought the director was trying to do since so much of the story was missing from this story, for instance. The fact that the dad died, the fact that that one guy was her brother, the fact that he was in charge after the dads death, the fact that that one kid who barely had a cameo proposed to her. I say her and him, because well....these characters didn't use names when addressing each other, and as a result i never learned their names short of heath cliff. I think this director needs to realize that when a character introduces themselves to a new character we can then learn from this who they both are, what their social standing, what they are like, etc. Its also helpful when characters inform other characters of events that are a backdrop to the events we are seeing which has a triple fucntion of building character, informing protagonists of the complicated histories present but also informing the audience of something.

4934376,1,B006328QWI,"As Wuthering Heights is one of my favorite books, I've seen most film adaptations of the story. While only a few stick out in my mind as ""great"" (the 2009 PBS Masterpiece Theater version being one of them), this is the only one that I've felt doesn't deserve to share a title with Emily Bront's novel.

It has a few things to its credit, of course. I liked the casting choices for adult Catherine and Heathcliff, and when you could see the scenery (which wasn't often, because the camera was shaky, the picture was dark, and the film was full of strange close-ups), the film was aesthetically beautiful.

The biggest issue with this movie lies in its lack of dialogue. Wuthering Heights is a very character and dialogue driven story, and this film neglected what are arguably the two most famous scenes: Catherine's declaration of ""I am Heathcliff,"" and Heathcliff's tortured reaction to her death, ""I cannot live without my life! I cannot live without my soul!"" Both of these scenes are touched upon but the dialogue is changed and the scenes shortened. Catherine's scene, in particular, is a pivotal moment in the novel that was sorely mistreated in this film.

It isn't the fault of the actors that I disliked this movie: the fault lies in the script and the direction. Honestly, even if this movie didn't come attached to the fame of the novel, it still wouldn't have been what I'd call a ""good"" movie. I felt very little for the characters, I was half asleep through most of it because of its dragging pace and lack of talking, and most of the time, I couldn't tell what was happening because of the aforementioned shaky camera and dark picture.",1469491200,3,1650,4.6632302405498285

The life of that time in that place is starkly shown  the dirt, the bugs, the blood, the animals dead and alive. How people dealt with their excretions. There may not be much spoken but the passion is clear. Also, the ages of the characters are closer to the text than other renditions. Cathy was 15 when she accepted Edgar. 19 when she died. My only complaint is that the generation of younger Cathy and of Hareton are not included, because that is a happy ending.

Its a mixed bag, there both things that work well and things that don't work well. The racial aspect I think drove home the fact that Heathcliff was an outsider and he never felt accepted or welcome. He was treated like a slave by his own family. If youve read the book there are some theories that his character is actually a half sibling. However in this version I didn't think there was much chemistry between Catherine and Heathcliff. They were more like childhood friends that were separated by class, greed and other people in their environment. When they get older Catherine treats him like a yoyo -hot and then cold, even though she is married/ pregnant. This is hard on him because she was the only person who showed him any kindness during his childhood. They don't really touch on the supernatural aspect of the story where he begs for her spirit to haunt him. He never gets visited by her spirit or ghost. Instead he tries digging up her corps which is a little more disturbing and shows the madness he must be suffering. Im glad I saw it but I am not likely to ever re-watch it.

My recommendation is to read the book first, then if you enjoy the book, watch the movie. In my opinion, this is a movie that is best watched after you read the book, in much the same way that the Dune movies made more sense to people who had read Frank Herbert's excellent books.

Wuthering Heights is a love story, but I did not love it. Perhaps the producer wanted it to seem like a desolate movie, similar to the settings where the book took place.

4934590,3,B006328QWI,"First, if you are not familiar with Emily Bronte's story, this film is not the place to start.  It's more of an adaptation than a faithful rendering of the original characters and plot. While that is always true to some extent when a book is brought to film, in this case I think many who had never read the book would get lost watching this.

:::::SPOILERS::::
If you are familiar with the story, you may miss the second generation characters.  We catch one or two glimpses of Hareton Earnshaw as a very young, psychopathic child (the sort of child Ann Bronte was more apt to write than Emily. Emily's Hareton was angry and confused, not cruel.) but Cathy dies before giving birth to the young Catherine Linton, and Linton Heathcliff doesn't exist at all. There was some small redemption in the story of those characters.  You'll have to decide for yourself if that is more or less true to the original author's intent.

Wuthering Heights is an utterly amoral story, something that outraged reviewers but delighted readers at the time of it's publication. This screenplay seems to reach for that original shock, and succeeds through dialogue and incidental actions not in the original story, which gives the modern viewer a feel for how readers may have seen it when first published. .

I am not as enamored of the cinematography as many other reviewers, but I have to say they play beautifully with the theme of light vs. dark.

One more thing:  The actor(s) playing Heathcliff are of of African descent. I thought this was an interesting choice as the book says Mr. Earnshaw found him on the streets of Liverpool, which had been a notorious slave port. He's described as 'dark as a gypsy' but without further detail, so why couldn't he easily be a child of mixed race? Unfortunately, it seems the actors were chosen more for their looks and ethnicity than their acting skills.",1441584000,,1879,4.724770642201835

4934599,1,B006328QWI,"Any characters in this film are not meant to resemble ficticious characters, dead or alive in Wuthering Heights the novel. Any similarities are purely coincidental. I can't remember the rest of the legal disclaimer in books and movies, but it should have been at the beginning of this...film. It should have been called ""Wuthering Heights Extreme: The Kind and Gentle Soul of Future Serial Killer Heathcliff  VS The....some...trait Cathy Has!"" I dunno...she looks at him all defiant and devilshly? She lives in a hovel for most of it? Eh, something to attract teens, who are the only people who could possibly like this, especially with the emo Brit kids I have had the misfortune of meeting on the internet. Sooooo overblown about being dark and not being normal and not getting love...just like this movie!!!
Ok. I'm not even going to say everything I think and feel about this but I will start by saying WHAT THE ----? The trailer WAS the best thing about this. I don't review movies because everyone has opinions, but in this case, even if you found the beginning and middle ok for the main characters, it sure as frak wasn't for Cathy and Heathcliff, maybe some other kids on the moors with the same names? So if you even think you understand the brevity of the love story in the book and what they share and can say this was good in any way possible in regards to being WH, your opinion is wrong.
Yes it was beautifully shot. SO WHAT? It wasn't brilliant. It looked like someone trying to look brilliant and innovative. Look at the newest remake of Great Expectations. That was great cinematography even with an oddly gorgeous and young Miss Havisham that was over the top as a ghostly, if not insane and ghastly figure. And ghastly in the way that she was unreal, but even she fit into the movie well, which even Earnshaw doesn't do in this. This isn't even WH from a cinematic point for all the artsy pansies who say otherwise (I love art btw; this? Not it.); the novel is never so bleak, nor is the emotion. The novel isn't bleak whatsoever, ever fueled and fired by emotion; love formed between two children of similar temperaments that are alienated by almost everyone else, then the passionate love of teens who care for nobody but themselves and each other. If the cinematics were telling the story, the moors would have been in full bloom of heather then ablaze then covered in snow.
This is a movie based on a novel that is not only loved but almost in and of itself a doctrine ON itself. Anyone who has read it knows this was an absolute farce. No redeeming qualities. You cannot shoot enough pretty swirly wind and dark broody atmosphere to make up for what this movie lacks in everything. People talk about the buildup between the young versions. What are you referring to??? They just look at each other, that is it!
I never thought Hindley would be the most interesting thing about WH, and that's another main issue of contention. What drove them so close together in the first place were the other characters in the novel that made them feel alienated and cling to each other, and they simply aren't there.
Some reviews have said that this is not for young people because of the animal cruelty. I think it is the exact opposite.
I actually think this was more geared TOWARDS young people unfortunately. Animal cruelty, sex, and violence is nothing to today's youth, especially considering they got an extremely popular young actress known primarily for being/playing a drug-using emotionally pent-up promiscuous teen on the early seasons of the BBC teen hit Skins to play Cathy, capturing an entirely different audience demographic that may think this is artsy and poignant but is just downright ridiculous, if it isn't obvious by children getting hitched. Isabella looks all of 14 when she gets married and Cathy looks no older when she's proposed to. That was kinda over by the 1700's (for the most part) in Western Civilization. When Cathy said she had been proposed to and loved Edgar with her swift and non-thinking reasons tumbling from her mouth like a 13 year old talking about her crush I literally burst into laughter. It was like hearing my niece or one of my younger cousins ramble. I laugh at them too.
The way they completely dumbed down what anyone said when they DID speak for the modern-day tongue to a stupifying and entirely juvenile extent and left out any actual personality in the adult characters was mind-numbingly irritating and insipid and oh my god, Cathy making woo-woo eyes ""in knowing"" (Why hello Effy Stonem, didn't think I'd find you here in Yorkshire in a Regency Era gown, though I can see you still don't talk---Effy is her character from Skins...and this movie, but here we call her Cathy...shhhh) does not count as chemistry or love unless they are also psychic in this version, which would completely make sense with the rest of it's stupidity and lack of anything believable.
As for the younger versions, relying on what seemed like normal teenage angst and hormones (and looking at each other some more) to build them up was ridiculous; you don't ever see what made Cathy and Heathcliff the iconic couple they are except...pulling hair out? Where is Heathcliff in all this? You know, the real one. The one that is as passionate as Cathy...oh wait, she had absolutely no passion, just what seems like curious cruelty once or twice even as a child. She likes staring more.
And then it gets even worse! I swear with the lack of personality or passion, it felt like they just made Wuthering Heights: Twilight Version, Where Nobody Says ANYTHING with Conviction So You Can Insert Yourself HERE....other than a few times, and it's never Cathy or Heathcliff. Nelly is more riveting. His love for Cathy without revenge takes away all motivation to marry Isabella, his lack of true intensity at either age leaves him to look like a psychopath. Watching Hareton and Frances having sex on the moors and killing a..something....what? Norman Bates? Any time he feels even a bit upset, it's ""Hey, I'm going to kill animals because that's a perfect way to put my non-existent expressions into actions and show my frustration"" because that is so deep and innovative. No, if profiled he'd be Dexter in the making except for his apparent endless love for Cathy, which made him really just look pathetic, and I think anyone can agree; other than his vulnerability to Cathy in which he fights in the book and his need for control, in absolutely no way is he pathetic; just a young man truly in love who feels betrayed and his pain makes him lash out in very sinister ways, and at least in other versions he is still the under-dog, the anti-hero we love to love and be astounded by in equal measures.
REAL Heathcliff's undying love/obsession/crazy is his motivation behind very move he makes in his adulthood. His true hatred for Hindley starts when Hindley makes him a servant and seperates the young sweethearts after how their ""father"" had protected their relationship, torturing Cathy after she gets married, marrying Isabella, coming to her when she is dying after MONTHS not a few weeks from Brain fever after being threatened with the law by her husband and basically losing his humanity. He'd never offer to raise Edgar's child, he'd probably have tossed it off a bridge. God knows Cathy didn't care too much in the book. And as far as Linton, Hareton, and Young Catherine go...oh for f^&#'s sake, there isn't enough willpower this movie gives me to even question that. Watching Heathcliff cry like a little girl was amusing, as Real Heathcliff would have backhanded him away from Cathy with silent tears and then probably whacked his forehead on something for a while. In the book and in certain movie versions, it's moving, it even in a startling way, whereas on here it was laughable. Sorry to say, all of his acting out on here just makes me think of the kid Earnshaw brought to the hovel; no english, a savage. But actually a savage. In the book Cathy was called so because she didn't act like a proper young lady.
Plus...well, you know what, if you've read this and you still want to watch it, by all means, go ahead and watch kids looking at each other, some feathers (I thought they would bring the young characters in the book in since Cathy actually comments that the Lapwing is her favorite bird and in the book...nevermind, it's just a ""bonny bird that wheels about your head to protect it's nest"" as said in the book), dark emo broody atmosphere, dark emo hormonal looking at each other, and I'm sure it will seem deep and like a new take on a timeless tale. It's not. I feel like it stole time from my life I will never get back.",1440892800,,8691,4.684107259646828

Where is the UNDYING LOVE mixed with PASSION in this version? I was waiting for it but it never surfaced. That is what Wuthering Heights is all about.

4934606,1,B006328QWI,"Skimming through reviews of this movie's lack of just about everything Emily Brnte's Wuthering Heights illuminated through her work; I decided to give this movie a try. I made it 7 minutes and 55 seconds into the movie before I stopped it with repulsion. However, the one star, I can give is for the lack of music and quiet characters I saw in the almost 8 minutes. Life in those times wouldn't have a wonderful score to go with every emotion and meaningful glance or movement, and I suspect it would be a very quiet life with only the sounds of a house and nature to fill your mornings, evenings and probably much of the interval between those two times of day.

What caused me to turn this movie off and voice my irratation was simply this: the Earnshaw residence. In this movie, the location of some of the most important and memorable moments of the book, the Earnshaw Manor House has been downgraded to little more than a shack that could barely pass for any sort of stables in that time to the unknowing eye.

While there an absence of the narrators from the book, the movie deals well with the early lives of Heathcliff and Catherine. However, there is very little dialogue, and Bronte wrote fabulous dialogue for the characters. Not sure why the director didn't make use of it. I did like the idea that Heathcliff was black, which created a different sort of tension given the mores of the time. The movie was dark, as Wuthering Heights should be, but the grossly overdone animal cruelty was completely unnecessary. The second half of the movie wrapped far too quickly. There didn't seem to be a balance between the childhood scenes and Heathcliff as an adult getting his revenge on Hindley. The scenes of the moors and the setting was well shot, and was, as it is in the book, its own character. If I weren't familiar with the book, I don't think I would have understood the movie at all. I'm a fan of soundtracks, and this movie lacked one, and while I grasp the starkness of no soundtrack background, I did not understand the Mumford and Sons song at the end.

4934633,1,B006328QWI,"First off, Wuthering Heights is one of my favorite books, and films.  I especially love the Tom Hardy Charlotte Riley version.
I was really intrigued by the trailer for this version.  I thought there were a lot of interesting possibilities for the story.  However, this is not worth it.  I turned it off half way through. I fast forwarded to see if anything interesting would happen.  There are some interesting takes with the concept of this version.  the cinematography is very sparse, and stark.  There's no soundtrack. The Earnshaws are portrayed as poor.  There is no clout with this family, though they are able to have a very few workers on the farm.  The poverty of the family and the farm was a slant I hadn't seen before, and could have been very interesting.
  There is definitely an intensity between young Heathcliff, and young Cathy.  But it never seems to get fully developed.  The one time I think the film makers were going for intense intimacy that bordered on that childhood but adolescent power is when Cathy literally licks Heathcliff's wounds.  Instead of being intensely intimate, it just comes off as weird.
  there's also very little dialogue between young Cathy and young Heathcliff.
 I can't say anything about how it ended, how the chemistry between the older Cathy and the old Heathcliff was because I didn't finish the film.  I wasn't invested in these characters, and in this story.  And this is one of my all time favorite stories.

  So, rather than watch this, go watch the Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley Wuthering Heights put out by the BBC in 2009.  It's so much better.",1437004800,6,1605,4.756363636363637

I'm a huge Wuthering Heights fan, so getting a fresh perspective on the story, and rekindling the passion is a treat.

This is definitely not the film to watch if you haven't read the book, or seen other Wuthering Heights productions. I think it's best as a really fresh look after exploring the more popular retellings.

For my part, I adored it. I love that Heathcliff is black. I love the realism (I'm an animal lover, but this setting is a harsh one, even in the book, so I didn't flinch at the ""cruelty"" - I mean, it's a farm pre-PETA, come on). I love the depth the film goes into of their relationship as children, most films spend more time on the adult couple. I love the amazing footage of the stark and moody moors - the director totally 'got it'. In fact, I love the cinematography as a whole, it's stunning, especially paired with the overall silence of the film.

As much as I love the story and am moved every time I read the book or watch a movie version - I've never cried during reading or watching. This film completely brought me to tears.

It is shot from Heathcliff's perspective, and as such had me considering scenes in new ways.  Watching it was a beautiful, exquisite, and darkly intense experience.

However, despite the sparsity of dialogue and the removal of the second generation's narrative from the plot, key details were changed from the original in ways that seemed unnecessary.  Additionally, because of the sparsity of dialogue, the viewer is often required to fill in gaps for themselves.  I  found that to be a challenge once or twice as someone intimately familiar with the novel, and I imagine the experience would be pretty confusing for anyone who wasn't.",1434412800,2,940,4.987179487179487

So what didn't I like?

Well, there was really only one thing I didn't like... IT ONLY DEPICTS THE FIRST HALF OF THE BOOK. The people in charge of making this movie, the producers, directors, script-writers, whoever it was... they chose to show the dark, twisted relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff as some sort of existentially bleak storyline without the redemption that is found in the second half.

This movie tells a compelling and emotional story even if it is new to you. However, those who have read Bronte's book and seen the many movie adaptations don't really need the words or even the entire novel depicted to appreciate the intensely dysfunctional attachment Heathcliff and Catherine have with each other.

What did I think?

This adaptation of Wuthering Heights is dark and disturbing. There are moments that are beautiful and ominous and some that are just weird and uncomfortable. Id pop a few no-doze before this one and prepare to feel depressed for exactly 129 minutes.

The scenery shots are so plentiful it starts to feel like David Attenborough should be commentating, but the real problem is that the relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff misses the mark. Stitched together by a lot of flashbacks that aren't particularly moving to start with, the film features limited dialogue and is certainly not for animal lovers.

The redeeming feature is Solomon Glaves performance of a young Heathcliff. His violent and animalistic upbringing is heart- wrenching and you just want to reach out and give him a big hug.

4934694,5,B006328QWI,"Intelligent, controversial, challenging and edgy new version that is the correlative opposite of the famous 1939 classic version of Bronte's novel. Instead of Hollywood gloss and Shakespearian poetry, we get a dark, largely wordless, angry version of the story. One that uses images in the place of words to create it's rough-hewn poetry.

This is a very sensual film, not in the sexual sense (although it has its smoldering moments) but in the way some films can make you feel a place as well as see it. The smell of the stables, the cold of the rain and wind, these seem to come palpably through the screen in Arnold's vision.

Her boldest move is casting Heathcliff with a black actor (arguably much closer to Bronte's intent than the very white actors who have always seemed to play the role - in the book he's described as dark, possibly a gypsy, clearly a racial outsider). It brings new depths and meanings to Heathcliff's role as an outcast, new poignancy to his anger and hurt.

It took me a while to lock into the film, perhaps because it so upended my conventional expectations. And I could see some just never feeling in sync with its odd, disturbed rhythms. But before long I was riveted. No longer was I watching ""a classic', but a living, breathing story of love, passion, class, race, and loss. Also, by casting young actors  as with Romeo and Juliet  the romantic intensity feels more understandable -- and probably more true to Bronte's time, when people married as teens, and rarely lived past 40.

Ms. Arnold is one of the most exciting (if under known) young directors around, and she continues to fulfill her promise with this brave new version of a timeless tale.",1397260800,5,1686,4.698305084745763

( I prefer the one starring gorgeous and brooding Tom Hardy) however the Arnold version focuses on the assumption that Heathcliff was black and that was the crux of the hostility towards him. Andrea Arnold uses the weather and nature, as well as dimly lit scenes perfectly to convey mood. She does this in her other films as well, as in FISH TANK . Arnold is an important filmmaker with something to say and willing to explore themes of racism and especially classism that other directors shy away from. This film does not have much dialogue but it still works as the characters and actors make it work which I know isn't easy to do for an actor. Overall 3 stars.",1396310400,,845,4.388535031847134

This version of Wuthering Heights is an original re-telling of a compelling story. it's depiction of the bleakness and harshness of the moors makes the weather and landscape a full character to the movie which it should be though it's a bit heavy on the rain and mud. Surely the sun shines once in awhile. But the movie fails utterly to depict the raw passions of the characters and leaves behind mostly the brutality. It's too bad. This is a story of full-out passions run amuck with ittle restraint. It's what made the book so fascinating and raw. Another plus to the movie was using two sets of actors-a younger version and then the more mature post- Linton actors for the main characters. There's nothing more annoying than to see older actors romp around the moors pretending to be young children as you do in all the other versions. However overall this was well worth a look. But it's lack of the human drama of the story (very little of the great dialogue from the book) just left the whole thing dry as a bone, capturing little of the raw emotion and complex relationships portrayed so completely in the book. Still waiting for that great re-telling because this isn't it though bits and prices come close.

4934702,1,B006328QWI,"I know two things for certain: 1) In the novel, people actually talk, and 2) This movie has robbed every morsel of passion from the novel and replaced it with shots of wind and birds.

Don't get me wrong, I love wind and birds. The moors are gorgeously wild and they play a significant role in the novel, both symbolically and overtly. But the moors are not the main character, folks. The main character is Heathcliff. In case this film is your only reference for WH, Heathcliff is that guy who walks around outside with Cathy a lot and utters about five intelligible words throughout the entire film. He's also one of the most interesting antiheroes in Western literature, not that you could tell from this movie, since all he does is kill rabbits and call people expletives (that's one of the few times he speaks).

I'm usually a pretty easygoing gal when people take artistic liberties with classics, but I have a lot of problems with those taken for this film. My biggest problem was the fact that Heathcliff arrives at WH as a teenager, not a young boy (in the novel he's six years old), which pretty much negates the entire tumultuous relationship between Heathcliff and Cathy. (In the novel, the two of them grow up together, side by side; they're not introduced as hormone-fueled teenagers, as the film suggests). Furthermore, the film completely neglects the pivotal scene in the novel where Cathy tells Nelly Dean that she's decided to marry Edgar.

The scenery is absolutely breath-taking. If this were a film about birds flying around the moors and wind blowing through people's hair, I would totally give it five stars. But as an adaptation of Wuthering Heights, it fails miserably. The film has taken everything that is passionate about the novel and turned it into a nature film. People barely even speak! How are we supposed to sympathize and understand our characters when all they do is flop around in the mud?

Basically, this is a movie about looking at birds and letting your hair fly around in your face. It's also about getting muddy. All of this artistic rustiness would be perfectly fine, except there's just one problem: THE STORY IS MISSING.",1388102400,93,2168,4.757978723404255

Unfortunately the filmmakers rely on you being familiar with the story of Wuthering Heights in order to connect with it - an approach that doesn't make for a great film in and of itself. The characters remain undeveloped, unconnected, and all over the place. Gone is the sense of dark and ominous romance that the story keenly holds. Gone is any actual connection between or love between Catherine and Heathcliff. There is so much missing from the plot and character development that you're left with beautiful pictures and some really disturbing scenes of animal cruelty.",1383523200,2,716,4.975

4934709,5,B006328QWI,"From the first scene we know who this story is about. I could tell you that Catherine is dead, and Heathcliff wishes he was in the ground with her.

This isn't your run in the mill love story. It doesn't contain a happily ever after. This story is about loss and grief. It's about chasing something that you've always wanted and never getting it. I could tell that this director loves this story because it was treated with care throughout. I felt like the characters in the movie were true to the book characters. They were often weird and quite dark. The book is haunting and this movie shows that deeply dark quality that most directors are afraid to capture. Yes, the movie does not go into detail about what happens after Catherine dies, but that isn't the point of this movie. We see Heathcliff and Catherine growing together and the bond that they have maturing as they age. It isn't the story of Wuthering Heights. It's about the love that develops in an unlikely way and how that changes them. This telling is from Heathcliff's point of view: we see his damage, his abuse, and his quietly brooding quality that makes him Heathcliff. Catherine is often selfish and unkind, just as she is in the book.

The film was made like a documentary, sometimes jittery filmography or in dark rooms. Sometimes there are no words, but the scenes speak volumes by the way they are presented. If you truly understand the story of Wuthering Heights, its grief and ultimately dark undertone, then I would suggest watching this movie. It isn't flowery or overly sweet, but it was never meant to be. The characters are largely strange, not discovering who they are individually, but as two halves finally put together.",1378944000,8,1707,4.6866666666666665

4934712,5,B006328QWI,"Wuthering Heights is one of my favorite books and this film vividly captures the passion of the novel. Bronte's novel is not for the squeamish or fainthearted--when first published in 1847, it evoked among readers outrage and disgust similar to that expressed by many viewers of Arnold's film.  The scenes of animal cruelty involving the dogs were taken directly from the novel.  Other graphic scenes depicting animals are accurate representations of rural life on a homestead such as Wuthering Heights during this era.  The sets and location shots were so realistic that you could almost feel the cold and damp.

The child actors were perfect.  Young Cathy's physical response to young Heathcliff's wounds in the film brilliantly captures Cathy's declaration "" I am Heathcliff.""  The young Heathcliff is so beautiful that Nelly describes him as a prince stolen from his kingdom--and his shy smile when she says this is heartbreaking.

The transition between the young actors and their adult versions was seamless and very believable.  Notably, most of the actors in the film were not professional actors and this added to the realism of their emotions. Adult Heathcliff's love for Cathy and lust for revenge was palpable.  The depiction of Hindley in this film was also far better than the one dimensional portrait of earlier film versions--Arnold allows the viewer to feel some compassion for Hindley and understanding that jealousy, racism and grief led to Hindley's eventual ruin. Unfortunately Nelly has a very limited presence in this version but the film does not suffer from her minor role.

I was moved by this film and thrilled that Arnold did not hold back.",1375315200,8,1668,5.099264705882353
4934713,1,B006328QWI,"This story was sold to me as the greatest love story ever told. If you are going into this with that expectation, you are going to be sorely disappointed. It's actually a story about dysfunction and abuse. It's not beautiful. It's dark, brutal, and disturbing. There is nothing redeeming about it. The characters are not likable people. The story isn't a warm and happy one. The abuse is senseless and wicked.

What makes it even worse is that it opens with this Blair Witch shaky cam that doesn't allow you to see the action. This continues throughout the ENTIRE FILM. Bizarre choice.

Then you have the lack of dialog and music. The bulk of the film is silent. While I HATE dialog driven films (they feel like plays to me- which is a completely different animal), you do need SOME to know what is going on. The many long, silent shots do nothing to create deeper understanding, make you feel anything, or move the plot along. Then you get to the end when, finally, we hear some music. And what strange music it is. When music is done well, it is a supporting player to the scene. This just feels wrong.

Another weird filming choice is the abundant use of extreme close ups and inserts of random images. The camera goes to boots, the mud, hair, a bug, a dead rabbit, the killing of a sheep, the moors... why? I get that one or two help to set the scene and but why bring the background to the foreground when it works very well where it is? And why do it over and over with the picture going in and out of focus?

The story itself follows the book until it doesn't. When it stops, it goes wrong. The film maker spent so much time enjoying his ""artistry"" and setting the scene that there isn't time to finish the story properly so it stops midway through the book.

The star of the movie is the moors. The actors are just okay. The story is weird and the film making is horrible. If you want to see snapshots of the moors, depression, and brutality, you will enjoy this.

Oh, and if you are thinking of visiting England, watch this. It is the only movie that I've seen that really captures the weather there. It's not bright and sunny like you see in all the period dramas. It's rainy and cold- even in the summer- just like you see here.",1374796800,39,2239,4.344497607655502
4934714,2,B006328QWI,"I didn't like that the mansions of the original text were replaced with reclusive, sub-par farm houses. The film doesn't address the entire second half of the novel. Also, it doesn't include the first few chapters, including the character, Mr. Lockwood.
It had *a lot* of b-roll; about 50% of it. Although it was all relevant to establishing and enhancing the mood and setting of the film (and done very well), the movie was already over 2 hours long; longer than any of the other adaptations.

4934715,2,B006328QWI,"I generally love classic English lit and film adaptations of these stories.  I will admit that Wuthering Heights has never been a particular favorite but I was curious to see how they'd adapted it for this film.  The film is two hours long and has very little dialog.  It moves at a glacial pace and was so vague I had to explain most of the plot to my husband who hadn't read the book because he couldn't follow the story at all.  There are long lingering, sometimes out of focus shots of people standing on windy peaks, insects buzzing in windows and people being cruel to animals.  We get to see Heathcliff kill a goat, a rabbit and a dog.  I understand that the Yorkshire moors are almost another character in the book but not at the sacrifice of plot.  The actual ending of the book is not there.  The story basically ends at Cathy Earnshaw's death.  The childhood scenes go on forever and the young actor playing Heathcliff barely talks.  Oh and they've made him black in the movie so instead of him being abused and neglected because of his low class, now the focus is on race.  The n-word is used several times as well as a few other expletives.  Other minor quibble is that the adult actors bear absolutely zero resemblance to the children playing the younger versions of the characters.  Also, for what is supposed to be a story about obsession, passion, and revenge this is a very  dull passionless movie.  I wanted to turn it off after about half an hour and I wish I had.  The film has the look of an art house film so maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough to ""get"" it but when adapting a classic novel, to me, story is far more important than atmosphere and this film is nothing but atmosphere.",1374451200,7,1710,4.415335463258786

Besides that, there needed to be more character development. Specifically, Heathcliff's transformation from a troubled child into a monster. Just a warning, there are animal cruelty parts, so if you love animals like me, turn your head when you see the potential. My most questionable part with the movie, I can understand the sexual interpretation of the book, and maybe, I'm too stupid of a reader, but the book did not reveal to me that Heathcliff slept with Catherine's dead body as strongly suggested in the film.

4934719,1,B006328QWI,"Wuthering Heights is one of the finest novels of the Victorian Age, full of passion and obsession and brutality. This interpretation, while capturing glimpses of the personality of the setting, fails to properly and completely characterize all of the characters, even Heathcliff and Cathy. It doesn't explain or exhibit Heathcliff's cruelty fully, though the invention of a sex scene between Heathcliff and a dead Cathy does grasp the former's obsession with the latter, while destroying Bronte's spiritual emphasis.

The one thing it did hone in on well, perhaps, was the central heart-breaking problem of the novel: why Cathy did not wait for Heathcliff. This is clearly the central question, as it ought to have been, though modern audiences may not appreciate why Cathy doesn't take Heathcliff up on his offer to run away with him.

Having Heathcliff portrayed as a ""black"" man (the actor looked bi-racial to me), was one way to ensure a modern audience appreciated the racism of the original story (Heathcliff as a gypsy or ""dark"" white person).

As a teacher, I would not show this adaptation in class. I doubt, highly, that I'll bother to watch it again. Too bad, since Wuthering Heights is a favorite of mine.",1371340800,20,1217,5.014851485148514

The one thing that left me horrified was the scene with Heathcliff alone in her room after Cathy's death.  Absolutely dreadful.

4934721,2,B006328QWI,"I love Kaya Scodelario and thought that her casting as Catherine was spot-on. Unfortunately, she has a total of about 15-20 minutes to work with in this entire film and her counterpart - James Howson - was not really up for the task.

While I do think that the tone of the book was capture by this desolate setting, a few things bothered me immensely and basically ruined the movie.

1. It's been stated before - the children look nothing like their adult selves. I'm not sure why the director thought she could get away with this. Did she think we wouldn't notice? It took me completely out of the story. This seems like such a basic thing to get right.

2. The ending. First off, the Mumford & Sons song. Um. What? Why? We've spent the entire movie in utter silence, paying special attention to make sure that everything is realistic and set to that period and then...Mumford & Sons over a flashback of a fairly disturbing scene in the mud?

Beyond the weird closure, taking out the second half of the book was disappointing. I felt that, as a result, this wasn't really a depiction of Wuthering Heights, but instead a movie inspired by Wuthering Heights.

3. Finally, the animal cruelty. I know it's been brought up before and I could deal with the bunnies and sheep being killed, but the dogs legitimately had me covering my screen. I just don't want to see it and I hope they took special cares to ensure that no dogs were harmed.

Overall, it *did* feel like a student film. The director seemed to care more about creating a film that people wouldn't expect over creating a film that would tell this story accurately and with the text in mind. I understand that a movie doesn't have to follow a book exactly, but Arnold seems to have no regard for it at all - not even enough to include the beautiful dialogue. To each their own, but I think this could have been done much better.

4934731,4,B006328QWI,"Ten years ago while I was still teaching Emily Bronte in college courses, I read some interesting  scholarly research about the  character, Heathcliff.  The author argued that when  Cathy's father brought the boy home to Wuthering Heights from Liverpool, he had probably bought him as an African salve. LIverpool, notorious as a densely overcrowded city, was also a major slave market, and Heathcliff is spoken of by all those grim Protestant characters who inhabit the Heights,  and who  perpetually scold the children, as  a black demon from Hell.  When I heard about this movie, I realized that the directors were making brilliant use  of this material.  I""m sorry I can't remember the name of the author or the book, but I thought the arguments were very persuasive and by this time I suppose this argument may be familiar to more readers.
This information was used, not only in the case of Heathcliff , but in presenting the heroine, Cathy,  as a rough country girl whose everyday speech, as we hear it in the film, is not the rather elevated literary language that Emily Bronte used in her book. The Bronte sisters lived among people who didn't speak ""proper"" English at all , and the film-makers  did a wonderful job of making us hear what those inhabitants of the Moors must have really sounded like. The immense tragedy of Wuthering Heights is that spontaneous feelings, and spontaneous speech and manners have to be sacrificed or ""outgrown"" because Cathy has the misfortune of being an Heiress, who must succumb to being coached, and married off, as a respectable young lady.  Cathy's pathetic failure of a brother,  who is finally ruined by Heathcliff, is another example of the difficult passage that all the characters have to make in one way or another.  Bronte is telling us that 'success' and 'refinement'  can become deadly forces of repression, rage,  and disappointment. I thought the actors were all brilliant in carrying off their difficult roles, including the character of Nelly Dean, who is actually the same age as the children, but becomes their surrogate mother and source of comfort. Bronte used a lot of different narrators in the story, most of them outsiders who are very puzzled by the people of the Heights, but Nelly is the most sympathetic and wisest interpreter of these children.",1367020800,6,2316,4.912596401028278

Heathcliff, like the audience is left to wander and wonder what could have been.",1363737600,3,498,4.670454545454546

It's a very depressing landscape and the movie literally is very dark so that you can' t see sometimes what is going on in the movie. If you want go get a tape with wind and the rain and you play that then it will be like this movie.",1363651200,7,347,3.64
4934738,5,B006328QWI,"As a huge fan of this novel, I have always been disappointed by the various film adaptations--they shy away from the dark themes of the novel or choose to remove vital parts from the book.  This is the first time I have loved a WH film.  I am surprised by those that found the cinematography to be distracting or too dark, etc.  The camerwork, coupled with the acting, was very strong.  I highly recommend this film.",1363651200,5,416,4.434210526315789
4934739,1,B006328QWI,The trailer made this movie seem wonderful.  It was not.  It was visually nauseating and the acting was sub-par.  I stopped it ten minutes from the finish and wish I had my hours back.,1363478400,6,184,4.352941176470588

Many scenes were too dark to tell what was going on, & characters didn't talk much. When they did you couldn't understand them! I'd give this a NEGATIVE ten stars if I could!!!!! (And I've read the book & seen different versions, this one is THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!)",1514851200,,418,4.30379746835443
8491657,1,B006328QWI,"There are several notable figures flipping in their graves, from Emily Bronte herself to Martin Luther King. Nothing spells ""social responsibility"" like having a hysterical white woman slack, kick, lick and step on a black man. The ethnicity of Healthcliff never was verified, but it is implied that he is of Romani descent. Substituting a gypsy for a black man is a bit of a stretch. I don't know if the director wanted to make the story somehow more ""relevant"" to modern audiences. Either way, the attempt failed miserably. If anything, it trivializes racism. A black man in the English moorland sticks out like a sore thumb. The Earnshaws are reduced to a bunch of filthy, violent rednecks. I almost feel this movie should have been done as a modernized version, set in the American south, with a poor white family fostering a black kid. It would have been more convincing. I will not even comment on the casting and acting. Catherine's eyes cannot decide if they are brown or blue, and the chicken pox mark on her forehead keeps moving as she gets older. All in all, this particular adaptation is a lame piece of racially charged torture porn.",1512259200,,1147,4.74

8491660,4,B006328QWI,"Artistic and atmospheric - I really enjoyed it, despite the numerous low reviews here, which I feel are undeserved. I've read the novel 3-4 times so that probably helped. Despite some, I actually liked the low dialogue, and letting the imagery tell the story. There is dialogue where needed, to move the story along, and all the plot points are in there. Very powerful filmmaking.

All the gripes about all the moor imagery was what actually drew me to watch the film, and I was not disappointed. Very captivating and hauntingly beautiful, from the wide shots of the moors, to the details of bugs and heather, it all comes together beautifully.

I thought it would really bother me that they cast a black actor as Heathcliff, knowing that he should be cast as a gypsy, but it was surprisingly not a big deal and seemed to work. I was surprised at how much the film had the main characters as their younger selves, seemed over half.

I knocked one star off due to some disturbing images which could have been dispensed with without losing anything.

A very visceral film, it makes you feel you are in the scenes, seeing, smelling, feeling. The acting was top notch too, if minimalistic at times. The adult Catherine is lovely, but not as much screen time as I had expected, judging from the DVD cover. The face you see most is Heathcliff as a young teen, and second is Cathy as a young teen.",1494460800,,1390,4.548
8491661,5,B006328QWI,"Although this film doesn't meet the expectations of many viewers who seem to want something more like conventional romance, I believe that Arnold's version of Wuthering Heights embodies the feel of Bronte's novel better than most filmed versions.  The violence, mystery, wild nature and brooding secretive passions are all here in a subtle and intimate way.  Not for everyone's taste, I agree, but worth a try for the curious and for those who love the art of film as well as the works of the Bronte's .",1492041600,,503,4.7701149425287355
8491662,1,B006328QWI,The lighting on the cinematography throughout the film is very poor. I found it a challenge to follow what was happening in some of the scenes due to the lack of lighting. I realize the era the film is set in but it still could have used more lighting. The scripting was extremely sloe moving in creating the story line from the book.,1490659200,3,334,4.317460317460317
