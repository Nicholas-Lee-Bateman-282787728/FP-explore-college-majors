954835,2,6305050074,I stopped watching it after 15 minutes.  I just seemed that it was a waste of my time.  Could not understand it.,1392508800,,112,4.045454545454546
954836,5,6305050074,GREAT MOVIE! I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! ANOTHER FULL MOON CLASSIC! IN A TIME WHERE MOVIES LACK SUBSTANCE! THIS CLASSIC SHOWS EVERYONE HOW ITS DONE!,1390176000,,143,5.0
954837,2,6305050074,"Out of sync audio and video tracks make the film hard to follow. See the lips move and 3-5 seconds later you hear the voice. Meanwhile, the video continues with the voices coming further away from the scene they go with, so not worth the struggle to watch.",1387324800,,256,4.354166666666667
954838,3,6305050074,"A boy travels to an Eastern European boarding school searching for his sister.  It's close to the millennium and there is a dark angel being summoned from his resting place (the talisman).  The angel is making human sacrifices to bring about the end of the world.

This is one of those weird low budget films that can be very enjoyable if seen with the right audience.

I personally loved the dark angel, but then again, I've always been a sucker for big bald scary guys.  (This one kind of looks like Dimmu Borgir's drummer, Nick Barker).  On the downside, the acting was very very VERY weak and the attempt at a twist ending sucked. However, the setting had a nice dark feel to it.

This movie has a lot of potential in a remake.",1152230400,7,731,4.41044776119403
954839,5,6305050074,"I have to say Billy Parish is a fantastic actor, but I am partial. I know him. However, I feel this is a good movie to watch. It is not a blockbuster, but it has a good story of a brother and sister torn apart by a legend. It has many good qualities of acting and breaking out to be noticed, finally. The Power Ranger actor supported Billy in his role. Great! Watch it!",1084665600,3,369,4.0
954840,5,6305050074,"As the millennium draws near, an evil being awakens. Fused to an ancient Talisman for centuries-Theriel, the Black Angel is summoned from his resting place to usher in the end of the world. The ghastly messenger must claim seven human sacrifices to complete the ritual and open the gates of Hell. A teenage boy and girl have been chosen to assist the angel in its deadly mission, yet they alone are the world's only hope for salvation.",1023580800,,435,4.662337662337662
954841,1,6305050074,"This was the second ""horror"" film that I selected for my Halloween viewing pleasure.  The first was Wishmaster (very good, see my other reviews).  I should have stopped after the first one as it turns out.  The plot of Talisman never really made sense to me.  A teenager enrolls in a private school (that is run like a prison camp) with the intentions of finding his sister, who he lost contact with following his parents violent murder (their hearts were burned out while performing some satanistic ritual).  There are only a handful of students on the campus, its between semesters or something.  The ones who are there begin disappearing, though no one in the film seems to notice or care.  The sister turns out to be the adopted daughter of the head mistress and she has control over a supernatural being (he looks kind of like Uncle Fester from the Adams Family, really scary if you're 4 years old) who is collecting souls to bring about the end of the world.  All this revolves (somehow) around a dime store looking Talisman.  Pitiful little movie.  The special effects are laughable and the plot leaves you with more questions than answers.  A Full Moon presentation, I was at least hoping for a little gore or some T&A, but regretably there is nothing to report.  It all ends very abruptly with no explanations of the whys.  If you've missed it, then you haven't missed much.",973123200,6,1383,4.6652892561983474
954842,5,6305050074,"As soon as you start watching this film you know you're in for a treat.  Full Moon did a great job combining a gorey film with an occult film, to create Talisman.  I thought that Talisman  was quite similar to The Dunwitch Horror, although Dunwitch only gets 2  stars from me, as it wasn't scary at all.  I definatley reccomend it  to anybody that likes a good horror flick, but definatley wouldn't  reccomend it to little kids or the FAINT HARTED*! *You'll only get the joke  once you've watched the film!",949190400,5,506,4.483516483516484
7881381,1,6305050074,"The film opens with some dweeb in a school uniform who gets his heart ripped out by Uncle Fester with a bad case of pink eye. Repeat this about a half dozen times, add a Talisman, a girl, and a Satanic plot line, and some terrible acting and script writing, and I think you got the whole film. The film is low action, minimal horror, bad drama, low budget feature on a number of DVD multi packs. Don't bother.

Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity. Boys in briefs. Not for real devil worshipers.",1440633600,,492,4.290322580645161
7881382,1,6305050074,"This is so awful. Really, how is that such garbage gets produced. It's a foreign language film that is very poorly dubbed in English, the acting is dismal, the storyline is moronic and the talisman is really tacky and ugly. this is yet another dreadful casting couch production.",1416009600,,278,4.8125

7881385,4,6305050074,"I had  low expectations going into this movie. I knew from the poster that this was going to be a late 90's straight-to-video POS. What I wasn't expecting was the shockingly poor dubbing, painful pacing, awkward dialogue, heavy homoeroticism, and ""special"" effects that make SYFY channel original movies look like The Avengers. There is no plot, only a premise. The whole thing feels like a European's sketch of an American low budget horror movie. It's an absurd movie that has no reason to exist, but I'm glad it does.",1411948800,,520,4.842696629213483
7881386,5,6305050074,"I like the movie because its show thing dealing with my illuminati craft other than that it was a b rate movie and some of the the plots was a little out there but in the end you and always learn something in any situation. it didn't meet my expectations but it was a movie!!

  thanks for reading my review!!",1411689600,,309,4.116666666666666
7881387,2,6305050074,"I only made it about 15 minutes into the movie. The good thing about it was the set, it was creepy. the lighting was OK for the particular scene that was happening and the stone looked kind of real. But gee whiz, if they're going to dub over the actors lines, could they have used some sort of timer and matched the speaking with the movement of the lips??? They were speaking English, so that has me wondering why they needed to dub over the lines anyway. Uhhhhh, well, I think most of the actors were speaking English. The weird bald guy with the red eyes was awful. Why pull out the hearts just to flame them on???  Why didn't he eat them? Or something more awful than flames shooting out of his hands. What?? When he turned his head, his red eyes or the red lights in his eyes stayed put while his head turned. Hmmmm. Story....been there,  done that, got the T-shirt a'many. The black kid was kind of a kick...might have a career if he gets a  good agent. The blond kid that played the snarfy, rich, spoiled bully was crappy but good looking. Again, a better agent and the ability to speak his own lines. I'll bet those kids were really good if ""who ever"" didn't feel the needs to dub over their lines. They were so stiff and stilted with their acting. It was like they were hyper aware of the director off camera screaming at them to do well. Maybe that's why their lines were dubbed over. I liked the part where you could hear sex noise....I thought ""OK now...we're getting going into a devilishly bad ass scary movie"".....but no. She just stands there and smiles knowingly at ""whatever i just don't know what"".....and the kids march up and get their hearts fist fried by the guy from the ""Adams Family"" minus the light bulb. I think this movie would have been great if these young actors had been allowed to run with their lines and have some fun. Other wise it was bad, boring, bad, boring, bad.",1410652800,,1903,4.370056497175141

7881389,1,6305050074,"At least one can fast forward, which is what I did to get this movie over with as quickly as possible. I've seen movies in which dubbing was used and the movie was still good enough to stick with, but the best advice I and can give is don't waste your time on this poorly plotted mess.",1406678400,,285,4.017543859649122
7881390,2,6305050074,I have tried to watch this movie 3 or 4 times from Amazon Instant Video on different types of hardware. It has audio synchronization issues that ruin an otherwise decent horror movie.,1397088000,2,183,4.75
