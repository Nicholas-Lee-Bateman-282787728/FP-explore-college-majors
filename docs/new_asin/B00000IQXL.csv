It is a must for any fan of drama to watch. The only thing that I didn't like was them making the Freemasons into the bad guys. Until the show comes out on DVD you can still watch it on HULU.

7911418,3,B00000IQXL,"I was looking forward like alot of other fans for this show it looked really good, something with Gale in it and just a good mystery story that would keep you on the edge of your seat each week. I would not watch it if it came back on unless kelton was somehow alive, but i would buy the DVD if it came out.  I would also give Kelton(Gale)5/6 stars.",1188777600,13,349,3.9857142857142858
7911419,2,B00000IQXL,"To tell the truth, Vanished accually looked like a great show. I watched it since the very beginning and even though a lot happened that made me think 'Wow-How can they solved such a thing' I was still intrigued. But the biggest mistake was that they never should killed Kelton (Gale Harold) off of the show. He was wonderful and I couldn't believe that they'd kill the main character. And I am still mad at them. So for Gale Harold I'd give 6/5 stars, but for the show I'd give like 1 star.",1187740800,14,491,4.290322580645161
