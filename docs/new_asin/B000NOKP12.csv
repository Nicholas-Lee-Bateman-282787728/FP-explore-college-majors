2775725,5,B000NOKP12,This had a good selection of some of the best Star Trek Next Generation programs.,1243900800,,81,4.466666666666667
2775726,4,B000NOKP12,"""STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION"", the series which is noted for its popularity and winning 18 Emmy Awards and the first syndicated television show to be nominated for an Emmy for Best Dramatic Series.  Back in the late 80's and early 90's, I practically became a Trekker because of this series.  The well-written storylines, awesome acting and most of all, hoping that this series can generate interest in encouraging further development of technology and possibly more research and development in the space program.

The series was shot entirely in 35mm film, among the first shows to be recorded in Dolby Surround and would feature four feature films with the characters from the series and also help pave the way for three more ""STAR TREK"" related series.  The TV series was released on VHS and all episodes released on DVD and in 2006,  ""Fan Collective"" DVD box sets containing ten episodes that were voted by fans revolving around the theme of the ""Borg"", ""Time Travel"", ""Q"" and ""Klingon"".

With the release of the latest ""Star Trek"" film, Paramount has released the Blu-ray edition of the ""Star Trek: The Original Series - First Season"" and the first six films.  On DVD, Paramount has released ""THE BEST OF STAR TREK"" for ""The Original Series"" and ""The Next Generation"".

""THE BEST OF STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION"" features a total of four episodes:  THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS (PART I), THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS (PART II), YESTERDAY'S ENTERPRISE and THE MEASURE OF A MAN.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

The following four ""STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION"" episodes are featured in standard definition (4:3).  Picture quality is what you would expect from a DVD but after seeing the recently released ""STAR TREK: THE ORIGINAL SERIES SEASON 1' on High Definition, many people wonder if Paramount will give ""STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION"" the same type of treatment and digitally remaster each episode.  With that being said, quality is satisfactory for a TV series on DVD, especially for a series that was shown on television nearly 20 years ago.

Audio is featured in English 5.1 and Spanish and Portuguese Mono.  ""STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION"" was among the first TV series to adopt Dolby Surround, so the series sounds good for four episodes that were shown on television nearly 20 years ago.  Again, I await the digital remastering of this series because I'm sure audio quality will definitely be revamped.  ""THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS"", both episodes feature a lot of action and a very involving musical score which sounds very good on DVD.  Overall, audio quality is clear and because the series is more dialogue-based and music based, the episodes are front channel heavy.

As for subtitles, the series is presented in English, Spanish and Portuguese.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""THE BEST OF STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION"" features no special features but trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

With the release of the latest Star Trek film in theaters, Paramount is making sure they are releasing a good number of Star Trek related films and TV series on Blu-ray but two DVD's that would showcase both ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" on DVD with four episodes.

Personally, any ""Best of"" is subject for criticism by fans.  I think with a series that ran for nine years, anyone could have their own opinion of what their top 3 would be.  Personally, I think three of the four episodes selected were well chosen but again, anyone can have their own opinion on what episode was their favorite.

For those who have owned the box sets or the fan collections, personally, there is no reason for them to buy this DVD.  Unless one is a hardcore completest or want to own a ""Star Trek"" DVD with a ""Best Of"" attached to the name, then go for it.  I can tell you that when ""THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS (PART 1)"" was released on LaserDisc with two episodes, I was willing to pay nearly $35 way back then (both part 1 and part 2 were on two separate LD's back then).  But I was such a big fan of ST:TNG that I even went as far as buying the original soundtrack for these two episodes.

So, for those who never owned the series, getting all four DVD's for a low price is quite cheap but spend a little more and you can possibly find the DVD season box sets pretty cheap these days. Overall, These four episodes are quite enjoyable but the DVD is quite barebones, it's a choice if these episodes are worth buying.  Personally, for me, I'm still waiting for that digital remastered and digitally restored version of the ""STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION"" series.

But assuming you have not bought any of the ST:TNG DVD's, you can't go wrong with this DVD release, as you do get four solid and enjoyable episodes for a very low, low price!",1243468800,33,4709,4.696711327649208
2775727,5,B000NOKP12,"This single-disc compilation solidly represents one of television's great Science Fiction series. With this set alone, no Star Trek newbie is going to be able to piece together a chronological sense of story nor grasp the scope of the vast Star Trek universe. But what's here is outstanding and fully displays this show's strengths: the well-drawn characters, the tight storytelling and (what has always been Star Trek's biggest asset) thoughtful dialog which is present even in the weakest entry here, ""The Measure of a Man"".
If, like me, you're a lifelong Trekker who's balked at the notion of shelling out serious coin for the full boxed sets, then this'll hold ya nicely. It may be wiser for newbies to start with the Season 1 box and continue from there, but this will certainly whet your appetite.",1242172800,4,803,4.911764705882353
2775728,3,B000NOKP12,"I have bought the other compilation sets (Time Travel, Klingon etc.) as they are a great compromise between not owning them or buying the entire series. Unfortunately all these episodes are already released in the other compilations. I see this as an impulse buy by the people that just saw the New Movie and want a bit more. I still gave it 3 stars as these episodes are really indeed some of the best.",1242086400,16,403,4.45945945945946
2775729,1,B000NOKP12,"Since there are already several fan collectives on the market, this release is a little suspect. A ""best of"" is always subjective (based on advertising dollars? most popular? etc.), and although these episodes have a lot going for them, like the previous reviewer noted, there are a number that might have been better for a ""best of"" collection. My guess is that Paramount is trotting a series of these collections out to help recession-proof their company. In a few years they'll probably also come up with the ""platinum"" collection.  Unless a fan was adamant about getting these episodes, it's probably better to just buy individual episodes through iTunes or some other on-line service.",1240876800,7,689,5.097345132743363
2775730,5,B000NOKP12,"If you are not a diehard trekkie and don't own all the seasons of the series or the fan collectives then this along with the 2nd volume are an inexpensive way to get some of the top episodes of the show. Of the four episodes included in volume 1 ""Best of Both Worlds I & II"" not only introduces the Borg but is undoubtably the most action packed two-parter that ST:TNG ever had and this movie length episode is better then any of the theatrical ST: TNG films, "" Yesterday's Enterprise"" is a fan favorite episode that brings back a beloved character and deals with time travel and alternate timelines, and ""The Measure of A Man"" features Data, one of ST:TNG's most popular characters, in a courtroom drama that debates the sentiency of an android.
While the 2nd volume has some outstanding episodes also, I felt that it was too Picard and/or time anomaly centered and would have liked to have seen other characters from the series, especially Worf, get a spotlight episode. Of the four episodes in volume 2 ""Inner Light"" and ""Tapestry"" both show Picard living very different lives, ""Cause and Effect"" has the Enterprise caught in a time loop where events keep repeating themselves, and ""Relics"" features a guest appearance by a member of ST:TOS cast and deals with aging. My personal favorites of volume 2 are ""Tapestry"" and ""Relics"".
Hopefully, a volume 3 will be released, making ""the best of"" an even dozen. If so, I would hope that they would include ""Sins of the Father"" ( a great Worf episode), ""First Duty"" ( an excellent episode spotlighting Wesley Crusher) and the two-part series ending episode ""All Good Things"".",1237075200,,1622,4.734982332155477

2775794,5,B000NOKP12,"The episodes in this great episode are truly great episodes.  My favorite personal episode of the Star Trek Next Generation is the Inner Light episode which is on this DVD.  I personally feel that the Inner Light episode is one of the very best moments in science fiction.  Unable to save their dying planet, the inhabitants of the planet through a rocket launch send a message to a person in the future of their existence.  They wanted to preserve their memories of their civilization and what life was like on their planet.  Captain Picard is the man in the future they make contact with.  Being knocked out for about 20 minutes, Captain Picard lives another man's life in his mind  At the end of the message, they tell Captain Picard that he is the man of the future and to tell others about them.  A flute from their civilization is also preserved.  This truly is a great episode, one of the greatest episodes in science fiction ever!",1399852800,,938,4.568862275449102
2775795,5,B000NOKP12,"I bought this as a teaser preview to check out how TNG looked on Blu-ray and boy the differences are amazing. I watched best of both worlds in HD at the theater and i'm excited to see how the whole series will look on my TV. This is re-mastering done right. Most of the original footage is untouched, no added scenes or updated character swaps like in Star Wars. They re-did the special effects with the latest technology and it looks amazing. I cannot wait until the complete set is on sale for cheap. At that point I'll get it...10 years down the line..",1399420800,,555,4.346153846153846

2775797,5,B000NOKP12,"I hate to admit it but I guess I AM a Trekkie! This and the first volume are good way to get a ""fix"" until I break down and purchase the entire series, which I must say is a bit more costly than I would think is necessary! The episodes in this one are all pretty good ones, but then again there weren't too many after the first couple of seasons that I didn't like.",1392422400,,365,3.88
2775798,5,B000NOKP12,"I've been a Star Trek nut since I was ten years old, and I enjoy the original series, the next generation, voyager, and all the movies. I have not purchased all of the season series of the next generation because not all of the episodes are necessarily my favorite. This dvd has a great selection, ""The best of both worlds parts I & II"", ""Yesterday's Enterprise"", and ""A Measure of a man"".",1392076800,,389,4.416666666666667
2775799,1,B000NOKP12,"The people who did the color correction exaggerated the saturation, contrast and white balance which gives the episodes an obnoxious candy look.  This is especially evident on the bridge of the enterprise.  The old look was light and relaxing.  Unique and yet perfect for the show.  They ruined this in the movies and used the same look here and it is disastrous.  Too much harsh contrast and you lose detail in some of the new dark areas where they've exaggerated the white balance correction to make the picture ""pop"" and look sharp.  The symbolic bright but natural look of the original show was to reflect Gene's optimism for the future (and not the stupid dark gritty realism cliches we get with other science fiction series).  Just don't feel the editors of this blue-ray disk realized that. If you want the correct colors, get the DVD.",1390435200,4,842,4.76551724137931

This is an excellent show recording in remarkable quality HD on quality media and packaging.  I'm happy to buy these individually (and not wait for a whole box set after they are all released) because it's really like watching for the first time again.  Even the audio is amazing.  (Somehow I never noticed that Riker had a lisp 'til now.)  Everything about this blu-ray is execllent.  Besides having bought it, I feel like I owe someone a thank you for doing such a wonderful job and even thinking to redo these in the first place.  All praise goes to Gene Roddenberry anyhow, right!!",1387497600,,702,4.515873015873016
2775813,4,B000NOKP12,"Like Vol. 1 before it this is a good choice for fans of the show who don't need to own the entire season sets. As great as the show was, not every episode needs to be revisited. So these collections are a great and inexpensive alternative. ""Inner Light"" really should have been on the first DVD, so it's great that it made it here. It's a wonderful and touching story, and won a Hugo Award for its trouble. ""Cause and Effect"" is a great puzzle of an episode, and it's really great to watch the crew put together what's going on. ""Tapestry"" does the classic sci-fi conceit of ""what if you change one thing about the past"" and makes it personal to Picard's life alone, throw Q in the mix and it's a great episode. ""Relics"" is the weakest of the bunch, but it's propelled along by the energy of Scotty!",1380153600,,799,4.298013245033113

2775815,4,B000NOKP12,"If you're a true Star Trek fanatic then you're already buying the full season sets and you can skip over this. However if you're a more casual fan just after some key episodes this is a good choice. The main attraction is obviously ""The Best of Both Worlds,"" and while I grant it's a bit of a cheat to count this two-parter as two episodes when it's one continuous story (so really there's only 3 stories on this DVD) it's still worth the price of admission. ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" is also a strong story with emotional story with a classic sci-fi conceit. ""The Measure of a Man"" is a little cheesy now, but it was great stuff at the time. It's the weakest entry on this disc but it's still a solid episode. For under $10 this is a nice mini highlights reel for those who don't need to own every single episode.",1377475200,,813,4.355263157894737
2775816,4,B000NOKP12,"I bought this single-disc set, probably like most others, specifically to get ""The Best of Both Worlds"" parts I and II, those being the most iconic episodes of Star Trek: TNG. The other two episodes are ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" and ""The Measure of a Man."" The former I do not care for much, but the latter is pretty interesting.

This is a very bare-bones item. I don't believe that there are any special features. The per-episode cost is probably greater than what the math works out to if you buy a full-season set, but compared to the average theatrical film, three hours of content for under $10 is not bad. Particularly considering that at least three of the four episodes included here are each better than the average Star Trek: TNG film. The production values of course are not as high, being that this is a television show, but the stories are a heck of a lot better.

Speaking of production values, the one thing that I should point out is that, watching this DVD in 2013 on a new widescreen television set, the picture quality and look of the show are very rough. I do not hold anything against anyone for that, but I have to say that in this version it has not aged well at all. I have my eye on getting the full-season Blu-Ray sets sometime in the future, as I've read that they feature much needed restoration and enhancement to the picture and audio quality. But of course, with regards to this item, you buy it for the stories. You buy it for the Borg, and in that sense, it is nice to have a convenient package like this available.",1373500800,,1548,4.447183098591549

2775820,5,B000NOKP12,"This disc is totally worth the money to me because it has RELICS on it! Scotty is my all-time favorite Star Trek character, and seeing him come back in the episode was a major geek-out for me when it aired in 1992. One of my prized possessions is a copy of the novelization of the episode autographed by James Doohan. That, and the episode introduced me to Freeman Dyson's theories.

THE (Hugo Award winning) INNER LIGHT is one of those episodes that is almost universally loved. It's touching and real, so it's a nice addition as well.

I'm a sucker for time travel and alternate realities, but CAUSE AND EFFECT has always fallen a little flat with me. I don't hate it, but I wouldn't rank it as a best.

2775858,4,B000NOKP12,"I bought this in advance of the Season 1 blu-ray release to take a look, and I was AMAZED by the picture clarity of this teaser disk.

The colors are vibrant, the edges are razor-sharp, every detail can be seen, everything just ""pops"" off the screen...  it is truly amazing what a great job they did on this.

The 4:3 ratio did not bother me; the picture still looked great.  If you want to see a bit larger ratio, catch TNG on the cable channel BBC America.  They seem to have ""zoomed in"" on the picture a bit, making it seem a little more like a 16:9 aspect ratio.  I think the ratio looks good on BBCAM and I enjoy watching this show on that channel.

But nothing beats this blu-ray release; it is just that good.  I watched all the episodes on original broadcast TV, and this is by far the absolute best picture and sound that you will ever get for this series.  Based on this, I intend to buy the series on blu-ray when it is released.

As far as the selection of the episodes here, I have to rate that as just ""average"", hence only the 4-star rating.

""Farpoint"" is a muddled mess of an episode in my humble opinion.  It's a wonder that this great series started on this very average pilot episode.  It's written by Gene R., and it's basically the same ending as the first Star Trek Movie, which he also wrote, and which was also a disappointment.

""Sins"" is basically a Klingon story, and a good one at that.

""Inner Light"" - I don't understand why people are so enamored with this episode.  In my humble opinion, it's just an ""average"" story and there certainly have been better episodes.

So as far as episode selection, I have to rate that as Average.  (In my humble opinion, ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" was TNG's finest hour.)

Regardless, TNG still looks awesome on blu-ray, the sound is great, and this great series is finally getting the presentation it deserves.  What a shame this great series only lasted for 7 years.",1342742400,,1931,4.4164305949008495

the difference in color and clarity was stunning.  The color variation of the aliens was almost non-existent on the upsdcaled DVD

2775878,5,B000NOKP12,"This is an introduction (in Blu-Ray format) to the upcoming release of the thoroughly remastered 1080p version of STNG's first season - and assuming the series' Blu-Ray release remains consistent with the quality of the content on this introductory disc, it will be SPECTACULAR.

This introductory disc contains three completed HD-remastered episodes (the 1.5 hour-long series pilot ""Encounter At Farpoint"" from 1987, the 46 min.-long ""Sins Of The Father"" from 1990, and - one of my all-time favorite Star Trek episodes, the 46 min.-long ""The Inner Light"" from 1992), a couple of teasers/trailers for the upcoming first season's release that present you with little hints of the nature of the HD restoration process, and a brief promo for the new iPad Star Trek app (which really DOES look *very* cool). Understandably, there is no audio commentary or other significant bonus features on this disc beyond the few small ones that I just mentioned. But somewhat surprisingly, there also are no BD-Live features either (probably no great loss, as most BD-Live ""content"" seems to consist primarily of trailers, teasers and other ads anyway).

The disc's navigation scheme resembles the beautiful ""LCARS""-styled theme that was used on the original dvd-format release, along with pleasant background sound effects. You can play all episodes on the disc sequentially or individually, select the sound output desired (regular stereo or 7.1 DTS HD surround), the audio language desired (there are a multitude of them), and the closed captioning language desired. Each episide's on-disc listing includes its title, original episode number, original date of broadcast, *and* its STARDATE.

The sound is incredibly crystal-clear, even in regular two-channel stereo, and the 7.1 surround is exceptionally good. Even with equipment that only produces simulated surround and/or broadened stereo separation from the original source, or even just straight two-channel stereo, the result is truly beautiful audio. Clearly, the audio has been *very* carefully re-mixed and mastered such that the dialogue, sound effects and music are each so clean and clear that one does not overwhelm the others - a perfect balance.

Visually, the HD remastering is about as perfect as one can possibly hope for, especially given the level of difficulty and complexity involved in remastering the original source material (which to put it simply was a mix of analog film and video) to 1080p. Colors and their hues and saturation levels - including but not limited to flesh tones - have been thoroughly corrected and stabilized. Contrast has been dramatically improved throughout, but not so much that the depth of black levels would be ruined. The sharpness of images' edges and details is near perfect - good enough so that you can clearly see every single facial wrinkle, bump in facial skin, and details of the props, effects and sets very clearly and without effort - but not so much that it all looks artificially and/or excessively sharpened (like so many cheaper ""quick and dirty"" HD transfers look these days).

It is important to understand that the engineers, technicians and others who were responsible for this remastering and HD restoration project APPROPRIATELY decided to do it in such a way that in many (but usually very brief) shots the original film's ""graininess"" remains - in these shots, removal of the original film's graininess would have resulted in an appearance of excessive ""smearing"" and/or dramatically reduced image sharpness with significant loss of detail. So visually, the overall end result *looks* like a filmed (rather than videotaped) product with all the clear detail and sharpness that a current-day filmed product on Blu-Ray would have - in other words, as it *should* look. Therefore, when viewing these HD episodes if you find the occasional graininess distracting you probably have your tv set's, monitor's, or Blu-Ray player's sharpness turned up too high (on my equipment I've found the middle settings to be *perfect* for this disc).

As others have mentioned, it was simply not possible to remaster STNG into a widescreen format without either losing way too much visual information or including extraneous and ephemeral stuff from the original production environment in the process (as far as *I* know, the only ""pre-1080i broadcasting"" episodic television series that was originally filmed with a full widescreen ""safe area"" was ""Seinfeld"" - and even *that* series has not yet been released in a widescreen version on disc, only to broadcasters via syndication). In fact, a few bits of original 35mm *film* footage may have been lost for good - even for this introductory disc, 13 seconds of the original film elements from ""Sins Of The Father"" could not be found in time for its release and therefore ""restored"" and upconverted SD video had to be used for those 13 seconds. (To their credit, CBS and Paramount state this on the disc's packaging. However, since this disc's release the ""lost"" footage HAS been found, restored, remastered in high definition, and will replace those 13 seconds of upconverted video in that episode when its season's boxed set is released).

Finally, this disc plays perfectly smoothly without any skips, stalls, stutters or dropouts.

When I first heard that Paramount and CBS decided to proceed with this remarkable HD restoration of STNG's first season, and heard of the amount of difficulty, complexity and cost that would be involved - and how much they would therefore ultimately have to charge for a season's set - I had my doubts as to whether or not it would be worth the cost to consumers, especially those who have already purchased one of the original dvd sets. But after viewing this introductory Blu-Ray disc, I no longer have any doubts - a set full of a season's episodes plus the tremendous bonus materials that will be included will be well worth the expected initial street price of about $80, even for people (like me) who already have the complete set of the series' original dvd release. The episodes on this Blu-Ray disc look and sound *so* good, when you watch them you'd think they were just produced within the past year or two rather than 20-25 years ago! In fact, the high definition restoration job done on this series was SO good I'm really surprised CBS didn't hold off on the high definition Blu-Ray format release until first running each season on the CBS network on Sunday nights (or whenever) FIRST (or at least release them for syndication first)... even some of the ""behind-the-scenes"" footage originally shot 20-25 years ago has apparently been restored!

So should you buy *this* introductory Blu-Ray disc? Answer: If you've already decided to purchase season one on Blu-Ray, don't bother - you'll be THRILLED with what you see and hear, and the bonus features that will be included in the Season One boxed set are absolutely FANTASTIC! But if you're still ""on the fence"" about it, by all means buy this disc... after any Star Trek lover sees it I'm certain they'll want to buy the full season set as soon as they can, it's *THAT* good. And this introductory Blu-Ray disc would make a WONDERFUL small gift or ""stocking stuffer"" for any Star Trek fan that you might know.

P.S. The truly astute observer will notice on this disc that CBS Television Distribution has decided to - during its final credit title ""card"" at the end of each episode - alternate between the original and very well known Paramount Television music track and CBS Television Distribution's original music track.

P.P.S. On 07/23/2012 NCM Fathom (""Fathom Events"") and CBS Television will broadcast to select theaters a one-night only special high definition program commemorating the 25th anniversary of Star Trek: The Next Generation and heralding the release of the Next Generation's First Season Blu-Ray release. Next Generation fully restored episodes #106 ""Where No One Has Gone Before"" and #114 ""Datalore"" will be presented along with new documentary footage of cast, crew, and the high definition restoration process.",1339113600,8,8081,5.128321943811693

2775882,4,B000NOKP12,"Fans of Star Trek are well known. They are devoted to the ideas professed by creator Gene Rodenberry that began with the original series and then carried over into every other incarnation. It was the idea that man would find peace with his fellow man, that people would accept one another for who they were, how they looked and that the boundaries of borders would no longer matter. It was a story of hope; hope that mankind would seek to find new worlds and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before.

The original series was short lived but the fans were not. So much so that they original cast came back to star in multiple films that gathered big box office. So much for what Nielsen ratings could tell. That series has found its way to homes via DVD and later blu-ray. The blu-ray editions are amazing featuring cleaned up prints with enhanced special effects. Now the same thing will happen to the second series, STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION. But before they release that they wanted to give fans a taste of what to expect thus this new release.

THE NEXT LEVEL offers three episodes of the series that went on to last longer than the original. They've chosen three episodes that are considered to be among the best with the hopes that once they are viewed here, people will be more than willing to collect the series itself when released. Again we're presented with the cleanest possible prints available as well as enhanced special effects. These are not replacing the original effects but cleaning them up and making them the best technologically they can be.

The first episode here is ""Encounter at Far Point"", the first episode of the new series that introduces the new cast as well as a recurring character from the series, Q. Here Q questions the ability of man to soar the heavens and to investigate space, to cross paths with creatures and civilizations unknown to man. He places Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) on trial to defend mankind and to show that they are not the primitive beings that he thinks they are. It is up to Picard to demonstrate that we are not the savages Q believes us to be.

The second episode is ""Sins of the Father"" in which Warf, the Klingon representative on the Enterprise discovers a brother he never knew existed and must return to his home planet to defend the honor of his father and family. Accused of being a traitor, a heinous crime in the honor bound beings of Klingon, Warf must discover the truth behind the accusation and who is actually responsible. But when he discovers this truth, will he be strong enough to do the right thing?

The last episode included here is ""The Inner Light"". This offered a very different role for Stewart as Picard. An encounter with an alien satellite emitting a beam of sorts results in Picard being hit with a ray that can't be disconnected. While others try to save him on the ship in his mind he is taken elsewhere, to another planet and another life where he slowly watches as that planet begins to fall apart. It doesn't happen in days but in years and with each passing year we see him marry, have a family and age. Is it really happening or is it something else?

STAR TREK in any incarnation was a science fiction series beyond any made. Not only was the dream of a peaceful world sending out people to explore the cosmos there but it offered so much more. It offered drama that focused on family which the crew soon became. It showed us that there were bigger things out there to worry about then our own petty squabbles. It showed that while we could be a violent race we could also offer peace as well.

Fans of THE NEXT GENERATION will be glad to have this tidbit to tide them over until the series comes out on blu-ray. For those unacquainted with the series, it's a good way to see what it was all about. This is a worthy addition for any blu-ray collection. The only bad thing about it is the wait for the entire series to arrive.",1336953600,2,3954,4.4986072423398324

All in all this presentation is far better than the DVD's released several years back.  I am a bit disheartened by the dust hits often appearing as super-white specs (in size of one to 5 pixels) at a frequency of one or more almost every 3 seconds. It would not have been hard to have someone quality control these HD masters and paint out those defects.  But like with so many 'restorations' now, this was mostly an automated process with little human input.

The FX recomposites are quite nice, albeit removing some of the magic from these shots.  At original broadcast or even on DVD, the future-feeling glowy sheen that was the stuff of childhood wonder has now been replaced by much more substantive and heavy, almost dirty feeling FX sequences.

Along with the audio improvement,  which just makes it even more of an enjoyable experience.  They put a lot of work into making this happen, which can now be really appreciated even more.

I'm also pleased that they left it in 4:3 aspect ratio just like the TOS.  I'm also amazed at the level of detail, you can see things like you never saw before.  I found it funny to see some shoe scuffs on the back of Data's chair along with something laying on the floor during the first few minutes of Encounter at Farpoint after Q made his debut and was drilling Picard, obviously in the day's of SD this would not have been spotted or at least too well.  Also you can see the level of detail of props even better, for better or worse it may make things look less authentic.

They say for the video on the blu-ray versions of this show, they re-scanned and remastered the original footage, as well as re-composited some of the scenes to ensure the visual quality is as good as possible.  The work really shows.  The video quality is very clear and detailed, and the colors bright and well-defined.  The shots of the Enterprise look very clear and detailed as well.  I am surprised to see this level of quality from a show that was originally recorded between 1987 and 1994, and I am really looking forward to the entire blu-ray release of this TV series.

To those who may be disappointed that the image is square and doesn't fill the entire TV screen: That is how the show was originally filmed, so we're not losing anything by not having the picture fill the screen.  To have it fill the screen, they would likely need to crop the top & bottom of the original image, meaning we'd lose part of the image.  Or if they filmed a wider image, the image would likely contain parts of the set, etc. that was never intended to be part of the image anyway.",1331424000,,1253,4.508849557522124

This affects the final Display Aspect Ratio or fit to the TV,This was fine for the old Television systems with the Aspect Ratio of 4x3.

Times have changed and it should have been presented in some sort of Widescreen format to suit most if not all modern TV's of today.

Even some clever re-scaling with the NTSC version would be acceptable.
I have to do this with all my 4X3 DVD's to view on Widescreen Plasma at 1024x768 via PC with Media Player Classic/Home Theater, using my own modified Display settings for full screen at correct Aspect, ( with slight cropping top and bottom)

This works well for NTSC media converted to Pal Display viewed at 60hz.
This is why I buy NTSC DVD's from Amazon.

Now I have to fit a Blu-ray Player to the PC and try to figure out a way to view and scale it to my Plasma Widescreen TV.

2775934,5,B000NOKP12,"I recall, when I bought the ST:TNG on DVD, is was very disappointed with the video quality.  At the time, the excuse was that everything had been shot in video to begin with to make effect processing easier.  Clearly, that was not entirely true.  The live action scenes were shot on film and then downconverted to video resolution for special effects processing.  Anyone with a large screen could readily tell that the old ST:TNG DVDs looked noticeably worse than other DVD releases, especially those that came out in 480p format at the time.

Fast forward to 2012, and bask in this gorgeous, remastered version of some ST:TNG episodes.  The quality is simply breathtaking!  And it's only possible because the original live action was shot on film stock and someone inside CBS crunched some numbers and convinced the bean counters that spending millions of dollars of redoing the special effects work would be worth the effort.  Whoever that person is, I tip my hat to you.  The outcome is a treat for the eyes and the ears!

I bought this for $15 to determine if I would want to re-buy the seasons.  I don't know if I will, just because it will be a lot of money in the end.

The disc consists of three episodes, chosen very carefully by Paramount to reflect well on the upcoming releases of all STNG seasons and some promotional materials.  I want to emphasize these three shows really are terrific.

Special distinction would belong to the episode, ""The Inner Light.""  It is, in my estimation, one of the finest programs ever to air on television, and is certainly a high point in the various Star Trek series.  The show manages to somehow create enormous dramatic tension despite most of its air time occurring in a community where the inhabitants are gentle, quiet and nurturing of each other.  I don't want to provide any specific plot analysis as that would likely spoil this episode for views who are discovering it for the first time.

To me, such offerings show why Gene Roddenberry's creations have lasted all these years.  The values he sought to inculcate: compassion, family (either actual or constructive) and understanding; those are reflective of all that is worthy in our society.",1330646400,2,1251,5.038834951456311
2775949,4,B000NOKP12,"I admit, I would have liked to have seen a 16:9 release, but I understand their reasoning in releasing the series in 4:3. Besides it being the original aspect ratio, as many others have pointed out, 16:9 would either cut off some picture information, or reveal too much (edges of sets, equipment off to the sides, etc), which would pull you more out of the story than the black bars on the sides, which one's brain filters out after a couple of minutes anyway. Think about this, when you're watching a movie on a widescreen TV that has black bars on the top and bottom, how long is it before you don't notice anymore? Have people seriously forgotten that TVs used to be square (and readily available as recently as a couple of years ago)? I imagine some of those people would give a ""Citizen Kane"" remaster a 1-star review without ever having seen it because it's still in black and white. Besides, if you mess with the zoom enough, you can usually can get an image that fills the screen without stretching things out of proportion (though, this may depend on your TV's design and capabilities).

But what about this TNG remaster? Is the difference noticeable? Absolutely! To be fair, the only Star Trek DVD collection I have (besides the movies) is the Borg collection. But I did not realize how terrible the series looked until I saw this. While they aren't my favorite episodes, they aren't my least favorite either (save for ""Encounter at Farpoint"", but it does makes sense to start there).So, my rating is more for technical achievement than the episodes selected.

As there are plenty of reviews detail the technical achievements (better detail, colors, and overall look), I'll point out a couple of things that I haven't seen pointed out. In the opening credits,during the last shot of the Enterprise, you can see into the conference room. On the original series, you could see the outline of a person walking by the windows. It looked like just white light and a silhouette. On the DVDs, you can kind of make out a second silhouette. On the Blu Ray, you can actually make out DETAILS, including the chairs, the table and back wall. And the uniform colors. It still looks a little off-skew, as it's not true-to-scale, but overall, very impressive. And the exterior shots of the ship are so much sharper now.

In ""Sins of the Father"", they tell you that some of the original film stock was lost, so they had to do the best they could by up-converting videotape. They even tell you exactly where the up-converted video begins and ends. The splices are imperceptible. And even the up-converted video looks great.

However, a couple of minor complaints, the first being the amount of film grain. I know there are limitations to working with film, but the Star Wars blue rays have little to no film grain showing (and they do look fantastic, even if they do have the incorrect Han/Greedo scene...but that's a different series).

As for TNG: The grain is most noticeable in ""Farpoint"", but is still a tremendous improvement over the previous quality. It does look HD, just with some film grain showing. The outer-space shots in all the episodes are incredibly crisp.

Another (minor) complaint, as others have pointed out, some times the shadows are too...shadowy. There is a scene in ""Farpoint"" where Picard's head almost becomes one with the black bars at the side of the screen. (I had long since tuned them out by the time it got to that scene, but that just happened to draw my attention back to them. There is also a scene in ""Father"" where Worf's brother is standing in the shadows, and his facial features are almost indistinguishable.

Overall, despite my couple of complaints, I enjoyed the disc. I don't see it as a ""money grab"", but what it is: a feeler put out there to see if there's enough interest to warrant the time and expense required to do this with the whole series. I can't wait to see how ""The Best of Both Worlds"" (both parts) is going to look when they're done with it. Nor can I wait until Ted Turner gets his crayons all over ""Citizen Kane""!( >;-)",1330560000,,4076,4.64493758668516

But curiousity got the best of me, and I picked it up.  And for the most part, I'm glad I did.  All the reviews and Youtube videos in the world can't actually recreate the experience of seeing what has been done with TNG.  It's been reconfigured to accomdodate today's technology. . .so if you don't have a decent-size (at least 42"", I'd say) HDTV and surround sound system, you will be missing out.

As a longtime fan, I'm not that thrilled with the episode choices.  I do think ""Encounter at Farpoint"" has been unfairly maligned for decades.  It's not that bad, BUT there are plenty of better episodes from which to choose.  ""Sins of the Father"" is just fine, although if I was going to pick a 3rd season episode to represent the best of TNG, I'd likely have gone with ""The Offspring"" or ""Yesterday's Enterprise.""  Likewise, ""The Inner Light"" is fine episode (and usually ranks among the Top 10 in fans' lists).  But it is very talkly and doesn't really show off the show's visuals.

As of this writing, a lot of reviewers are speculating whether CBS/Paramount will go forward with its plan to release all 7 seasons in the format.  I'm quite sure there is enough interest in TNG for that to happen.  It's certainly the most popular (though, ultimately, not the best) of the 6 Star Trek series.  Personally, I hope it sells very well, paving the way for THE best series, Deep Space Nine, to be released in HD.

In the meantime, ""The Next Level"" sampler is convincing enough.  It's just up to you whether it's worth spending a little money now, when you are likely to spend it again on the complete episode sets.

If you watched the show on cable in the 1980-90s, you wouldn't know what your missing until now... Even with HD and the Sci-fi network rebroadcasting TNG on a hi-def channel, you still won't see the detail that's on Blu-Ray. In some parts, TNG in blu-ray looks like an actual StarTrek Movie from the 1980s instead of television grade programming.

Although TNG was said to be originally shot 35mm to tape, the transfers are all 4:3 ... so your HDTV will not be used to its potential ... It's a shame because we live in an era when old comedies like Cheers, probably shot on Super-16mm, are now broadcast in wide-screen on the HD channels. If the information is there on 35mm, TNG should be revamped in wide-screen, too -- as the promos for this sampler hinted.

2775977,5,B000NOKP12,"I'll start by saying I've been a casual TNG fan since it first aired.  I've probably seen every episode (possibly missing just a handful).  I'm also relatively technical and understand the nuances of screenmodes, aspect ratios, color depths, and other ""HD things"".

I'm OK with the fact that they left this in the original 4:3 aspect, assuming that they wouldn't have been able to squeeze any more detail out of the film negatives than they did here.  Yes, it's in 4:3.... BUT, it preserves more *actual* information by not clipping off top and bottom to get to 16:9.  All you'd be doing by making it 16:9 would be blurring / upconverting the same information, which you can do with the zoom function on your remote if you want.

There is absolutely more clarity and detail than any other version or format of TNG I've seen previously, and it's quite stunning actually.  It almost looks like it was filmed in HD resolution.  As another reviewer said, I suspect they manipulated the contrast a bit to give make the black levels appear deeper.  This is particularly noticeable in darker scenes such as inside Farpoint station.  However, I still have to think that it looks better than any previous rendering.  And there is certainly some cinematic-style gaussian noise going on from frame to frame, but it didn't really detract from the overall quality.  Another issue I noticed was the occasional white salt & pepper blips on some frames, in random areas of the screen.  They are small enough that some may not notice them, but also small enough that they could have been removed without damaging the content.  I occasionally noticed a bit of light flicker in certain areas of the screen in some scenes, but this may just be par for the course with digitizing 35mm analog film.

I give this 4.5 stars, but had to round to 5 since amazon doesn't do .5 increments.  :)  It definitely does make me look forward to seeing the remastered seasons on blu-ray.",1330041600,,1951,4.724852071005917

""Every physical element of DEEP SPACE NINE is shot on film, not videotape. However that film is just a first step. As soon as it's printed, it is transferred to D2 videotape. Then the film is put into storage and - provided no disasters occur while an episode is in postproduction - it never sees the light of day again. ... Theoretically, it would be possible to return to the original raw film and redo all the visual effects at higher resolution, but such a step would be the equivalent of putting the show through the complete postproduction process again."" (from ""The Making of Star Trek Deep Space Nine"", Pocket Books, 1994)

Indeed it looked as if Star Trek THE NEXT GENERATION and DEEP SPACE NINE would remain forever locked in the low resolution NTSC (525 horizontal lines) and 4:3 viewing format. But when Gary Hutzel descended into the film archives in 1996 (in order to evaluate the quality of the original film negatives of the Original Series for use in the DS9 episode ""Trials and Tribble-ations"") he set a chain of events in motion that would lead to the remastering of TOS (digitize the original edited negatives and add new CGI shots) and finally to serious considerations to actually put TNG through the complete postproduction process again: to locate, evaluate and repair 138 miles of 35mm film, to digitize and re-edit 178 episodes, and on top of that to recreate CGI effects in film resolution to replace the original video effects and to cover production flaws - to boldly reassemble what no one has ever done before.

Given the rather incredible magnitude of this remastering project, this Next Level Blu-ray Disc is an invitation to get an idea what may come out of that project and a test to see how we react and how we feel about this BD and STAR TREK - THE NEXT GENERATION for the very first time in high definition.

Is this sampler BD below or beyond our expectations? Does it really have issues like noticeable film grain and crushed black levels (i.e. the artificial darkening which gives black areas an extra punch at the cost of brightness, contrast and picture detail, which unfortunately affects the original STAR WARS Trilogy discs)?

There are examples where film grain can indeed be bothersome (e.g. some BABYLON 5 footage, ALIENS before it was remastered for HD utilizing a revolutionary new cleaning process without the usual terrible side effects) but I felt film grain to be average or even better than average watching the three TNG episodes on a 7' wide front projection screen in Full HD (because ILM used their favorite large Vistavision film negatives - considered absurd for a TV production, then - film grain is no issue at all in effect shots of the Enterprise-D).

While some scenes in ""Sins of the Father"" may appear darker than usual because of lighting issues or director's choice, the discernible textures in the black areas of the uniforms reveal that crushed black levels are fortunately not an issue either (watch the wrinkling in the pants of Patrick Stewart and Jonathan Frakes as they walk to the transporter room). The DVD seems a tiny bit brighter, yet doesn't reveal extra visual information of Tony Todd's makeup or his Klingon costume. However, the Klingon Bird of Prey in the opening shot of this BD is much darker now (almost looks cloaked), additionally it has been replaced by a new shot with a different posture (so much for preserving the original and `sacrosanct' image composition...).

The banquet scene in this episode includes my favorite ""Wow"" HD moment when Patrick Stewart slices the turkey (never before have I seen food on a BD looking that three-dimensional), yet I wonder why information at the left and right side of the `4:3' image on this BD has been sliced as well, namely a space art painting behind Brent Spiner and the broader view of the one behind Gates McFadden. (Update 02-29-12: AV Science suggests that what we see here is the original image available for audiences of the 90's after the overscan of their TV set's had trimmed the outer edges)

Unlike the DVDs, however, the images of all three episode samples yield the original uniform colors (finally) and are rich in contrast without any artificial tainting, edge enhancement, color boosting or the like. This BD is nothing short of a reference sample for the industry on how to properly remaster older film negatives.

I immensely enjoyed the highly aesthetic, concise and informative ""Hint of HD"" teaser in the bonus material (almost a reason of its own to buy this BD) as it takes you through the (outrageously simplified) remastering process by scanning, developing and digitizing the Full Aperture 35mm negative, zooming into it and resulting in a fantastic shot of the Enterprise-D in widescreen, something we have not seen since the movie STAR TREK GENERATIONS eighteen years ago...

...and something we are not going to see again any time soon?!?!

This particular teaser (which suggests to extract a 16:9 widescreen image out of the Full Aperture 35mm negative) has led to completely understandable expectations that TNG is indeed ""reborn for the new generation"" in 16:9 widescreen (not to mention the 16:9 menu of the Next Level BD) and therefore not only raises a couple of eyebrows but a lot of questions:
- Has this ""Hint of HD"" teaser exclusively been made for HDTV broadcasters and their audiences (16:9 viewing format for HDTV, 4:3 viewing format for Blu-ray Disc)?!
- Why tease BD consumers with a full 16:9 image when instead the episodes on this Blu-ray Disc are (and according to the Okudas all will be) 4:3 only?
- Is this yet another market demand test by CBS / Paramount concerning the picture format?!  (which shortsighted 4:3 fundamentalists seemingly like to see concluded exclusively on their behalf and by literally all means)

The thought-terminating clich that has been excessively abused here at Amazon is that by zooming into the original 1.37:1 (Full Aperture 35mm) negatives of TNG to create a widescreen image, areas at the upper and lower end of the image would be cropped (correct) and essential visual information would be lost (incorrect)!

Actually, it doesn't matter whether there had ever been considerations for a widescreen reformatting of the Next Generation back in 1987 or not (for the original text of this review please go to Amazon.co.uk).

Fact is that, unlike the original and other older TV series, the ""action safe"" areas in the 35mm camera viewer (for shooting TV on film) were considered and respected during production of TNG. If the picture composition of the TNG images doesn't speak for itself, then listen to a true authority, TNG director and Academy Award winner Robert Legato:  ""STAR TREK (TNG) is normally shot flat on 35mm - composed in such a way that the outer edges unseen on television contain no crucial information.""(CINEFEX # 37) You can take a look at the camera viewer on Wikipedia under ""35mm film"" (go to ""Technical Specifications"").

What we have 'unfortunately' seen on DVD (and now on the Next Level BD) is the original, final image from the D1 tapes with all those areas that contain no crucial information and which audiences did not see originally because the overscan of the old 4:3 tube television sets cropped off visual information on all four sides of the image (see BD images of ""Sins of the Father"").
Many people have either forgotten their original viewing experience from the 90's or have grown so attached to all this insignificant visual information (I can live without looking at the crutches of Data, Worf and Geordi sitting at the Ops command bridge consoles) that some now can't or won't let go of it.

For any widescreen reformatting it is inevitable to trim parts of the 1.37:1 negative image, but that would only result a) in the loss of ""no crucial information"" and b) would only be limited to the top and bottom areas of the image.
Comparative studies between the original D1 image of the TNG episode ""Mnage a Troi"" and the widescreen image that had been extracted from the 1.37:1 camera negative for use in an episode of ENTERPRISE (1.78:1 aspect ratio) have revealed that a TNG widescreen aspect ratio of 1.66:1 is definitely possible without interfering or compromising any artistic considerations in terms of picture composition (see link in the 4:3-16:9 product discussion below).

And if there are occasional objects in the outer left and right areas of the camera negative containing objects beyond the ""action safe"" area, then I suggest they reactivate HARRI. HARRI is Adam Howard's sophisticated digital image system which he used during postproduction of DS9 to fix exactly those ""things that aren't intended to be seen"" mentioned by Ms. Okuda (as an obstacle to exploit those areas for widescreen reformatting): ""Everything from replacing a live video-monitor display in Ops that didn't photograph properly, to blanking out an inadvertent appearance by the overhead microphone boom or by a ""bogey"" reflected in a window, and even, in the first season, smoothing the seams on Odo's early makeup.""

Rather than to use state-of-the-art CGI tools now to remove those constant pesky microphone booms in the upper image areas of the TNG camera negatives, I'd suggest they save themselves the extra cost by just trimming those upper image areas containing ""no crucial information"" and instead recommit such resources to remove those occasional ""things that aren't intended to be seen"" at the sides.

The final 1.66:1 TNG widescreen image would not only help to reduce the appearance of those annoying, black pillars at the sides but the final image would actually contain the original 4:3 viewing experience (as the image you would now see on your HD TV with no overscan would be identical to the image you saw back in the 90's on your old TV with overscan).

Another consideration is that TNG on 35mm film has at least twice the pixel resolution of our current Full HD (1920 x 1080). Zooming into the previous 4:3 TNG videos only enlarged low resolution, but now, zooming into the high resolution negatives we'd be able to a) see yet more detail and b) almost put the entire resolution potential of our Full HD widescreens to good use (but with the current 4:3 TNG images in HD over a quarter of our widescreen TV's image area and resolution potential remains inactive and dark).

Since there is an abundance of good and sensical reasons in favor of reformatting TNG at least into a moderate 1.66:1 (aspect ratio) widescreen image, I can't help the feeling that we may actually be looking at a marketing scheme like this (purely conjectural and with intentional pun which is still a lot nicer than all the name-calling others had to endure just because they were wondering about 16:9 options):

2012 (Confirmed) - The ZERO OVERSCAN Edition (""discover all the insignificant details from the outer edges of the image for the first time in high definition. From Data's crutch to the fixed stars in the command bridge's ceiling. A must for every Trekkie, 4:3 aficionado, member of the Nitpickers Guild and other fetishists"")

2019 - The ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN Edition (aspect ratio 1.66:1) with the fabulous ""original viewing experience"" feature (""the unique and revolutionary `narrowvision' technology will enable the viewer to mask sides of the widescreen image and thus recreate the original viewing experience of an ancient 4/3 Television with average overscan. Time travel at its best!"")

2026 - The FULL 16:9 WIDESCREEN Edition in 1.78:1 (""thanks to the rediscovery of a 30 year old postproduction technique from DS9 we are now able to remove disturbing objects at the edges of the original camera negative, enabling us to extend the image to fill the entire width of the HD screen"")

2033 - The ORIGINAL VISION Edition (""contains all the great ideas of the SPFX wizards that couldn't be realized because of cost and schedule constraints, then. As members of the effects team are unfortunately no longer available, we had to rely on fragmentary notes and recreated the effects to suit the taste of our contemporary audiences."")

Since I already own the ZERO OVERSCAN Edition and the (almost) original 4:3 experience on DVD (it doesn't get any more ""original"" concerning the picture quality of the original TV presentation), I suggest that CBS / Paramount instead considers bringing forward the ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN Edition.

Of course, the logical best solution for the coming Season One of TNG on BD would be a viewer's choice to either select watching the 0-overscan 4:3 image OR a new widescreen image in 1.66:1 (which is in essence what we got with TOS on BD: the choice to either select the original OR a redesigned version for ""the new generation"").",1329955200,4,12797,4.917052826691381
2775981,5,B000NOKP12,"I must admit that I am biased because I am a die-hard Star Trek fan (a Trekker, not a Trekkie).  I loved each series and the movies.  Seeing these familiar episodes of TNG in blu-ray and 7.1 sound was like watching them again for the first time.  The three episodes, made at different times during the seven season run, are all amazing with today's technology.  Encounter at Farpoint is the first episode of Star Trek The Next Generation and introduces us to the Captain Jean-Luc Picard and other crew members of the 24 Century Enterprise.  The ship travels to Farpoint Station to pick up the new first officer, William Riker.  This was a good episode, but the show only improved from there on.  Sins of the Father is an exciting episode where Worf must return to the Klingon home world and stand trial for his father's alleged treasonous behavior.  Finally, The Inner Light is my personal favorite episode and demonstrates just how good the show had become as it matured.  In this episode, Jean-Luc Picard is struck by a beam from a space probe and assumes another mans identity.  During the course of the show Picard ages 80 years and learns the story of a race of humanoids who were wiped out when their sun went Nova.  I've watched each episode countless times and I am totally amazed at the difference in the picture and sound on this disc.  As I understand, the first season of TNG will be released on blu-ray later this year.  This is full 1080p and 7.1 Surround Sound.  I don't know about anyone else, but after watching these three episodes on this disc, I will be one of the first to purchase the new discs.  I already have the entire series on Standard Definition, but these are so good that I believe they are a must have for a die-hard trekker.  I would give this ten stars if that rating were available.",1329868800,,1817,4.510703363914373

Played the last one first ""The Inner Light"" a super good story. Then the ""Encounter at Farpoint"" The pilot one. It looks like if you record video on a to dark place that what is looks like. It's were it has a salad surface on things. I don't know what they call that but it's like little dots sparking on salad surfaces.

The enterprise ship looks vary good in high definition. It's not wide screen ether. I guess that's the same on there 35mm movie film.

Watched just a little live HD TV to make sure it don't look like, not salad video. It does look very good. It's to bad that Star Trek The Next Generation one don't look as good as HD TV.

After that I watched a TNG that recorded on my HD TiVo. They have it in wide screen. I guess they stretch it out to have it wide screen. The Blu-ray Disc is not Wide screen.

I hope they do better on the season that come out on Blu-ray Disc. Maybe they have to use some other way to convert if from 35mm movie film to 1080p. Not sure but seems like there should be something like that.

If this sampler is anything close to what we can expect from Paramount I'm hooked. I have never seen TNG look so wonderful. The drab reddish-orange uniforms are now red with detail. I did say wonderful right? There are details no one has ever seen before. One thing that will stand out.....when you see the Enterprise take her glamour shot across the screen you can actually see the Enterprise hull name clearly.....not only because you mentally know what it says.....you actually see each letter clear as a bell....the ships tile texture?...Wow! Trust me when I say you have NEVER seen it look this way.

Not having owned ST:TNG in any format prior to this release (excluding the TNG movie bluray collection), I was unprepared for how good it actually looks! I was unaware that the series was filmed in 35mm: I just assumed it was recorded direct to video tape, because it looked it! While I never quite warmed-up to this series as I did with ST:TOS, I knew that it was more than just the characters, actors and the story lines that were keeping me from enjoying TNG as much as I did TOS....the craptastic video quality always turned me off, despite the ""improved"" production values and technological advances time has brought since TOS was filmed in the late 60's.

Not anymore! This was like watching the series for the first time! The PQ improvements, especially the SFX shots, just pop! No comparison to the SD version. There is no disparity between the live action and the SFX shots, as there is with the CGI versions done for the bluray debut of TOS. The sound is drastically improved as well! I actually enjoyed all these episodes much more than when I viewed them first run, especially ""Far Point""!

Pros: I now can't wait for the full season releases! Recommended!

Cons: I'm sure, just like TOS, the de rigeur high PRICE will knock my socks off! CBS/Paramount knew exactly what they were doing with this ""teaser"" release....make 'em want the series in the worst way! Well, mission accomplished!

2776008,4,B000NOKP12,"In case you live under a rock and don't know what this is, this is a 3 episode Blu-Ray of Star Trek Next Generation. It's a teaser for the full First Season release that's supposed to come out late this year. Amazon has it for $15 with free shipping and I decided to get it to see if I might be interested when they release the whole season.

It contains 3 episodes: The pilot ""Encounter at Farpoint"", ""Sins of the Father"" and ""The Inner Light"" which is that award winning episode where Picard lives an entire lifetime on another world while he's unconscious for 15 minutes on the bridge, after an alien probe takes over his mind.

They took the original film negatives that the series was shot at, which inherently has better resolution the than standard def video it was edited to, and digitally enhanced it, and reprocessed the sound for 7.1 audio.

Right off the bat let's be clear - even though it's 1080p, its still only a 4:3 aspect ratio image because that's the way it was filmed, so don't expect it to fill your screen. Nor can you stretch it (although only a mongrel would do that anyway) since you can't stretch a 1080p image - it's already a full screen image and the black borders are part of it.

The visual quality is stunning. Unlike the Star Trek TOS Blu-Ray treatment, they didn't completely re-do the CGI, they just enhanced the original CGI. This keeps the the CGI scenes from looking over-the-top cartoonish like they do in the TOS Blu-Rays, and I approve.

I do have minor grumbles about the audio. The audio engineer made the mistake that a lot of them do and added WAY too much echo to some scenes. They do this to make it stand out better in 7.1 surround, I presume, but it really annoys someone like me (a former audio engineer). It's exaggerated. It's not terrible, just annoying at times. It's really noticeable in turbo-lifts. For some deranged reason the audio engineer thought a turbo-lift should sound like a parking garage.

The other minor issue is that some scenes DON'T look better in hi-def. Instead, the hi-def will sometimes make a poorly lighted scene look even worse. For instance in ""Encounter at Farpoint"", there's a scene where Picard is staring at ""Q"" in the courtroom and his face is half in shadow and back-lit. Maybe the lighting director originally did it on purpose and the effect worked in standard def. I don't remember it standing out that bad in the original standard def video, but it looks awful in hi-def.

Hi-def also tends to accentuate the sometimes poor makeup job they did on Data. The makeup is very thick and while it always looked acceptable in standard def, it was never meant to hold up at higher resolution. That was always my complaint about the Star Trek Next Gen films: in the films they used the same face makeup technique on Data as they did in the series, but on the big screen it looks like they painted Sherwin Williams Flat White Latex paint on him with a 4"" brush, and it hadn't yet dried. That makeup job was never meant to stand up to that kind of scrutiny. In the Blu-Ray I *think* they tried to digitally fix it a bit most of the time, but in the close-ups, it still looks very funky.

Now, the $64,000 question: will I buy the whole first season, much less the rest of the seasons, when they are released? I am not sure. While the Blu-Ray looks lovely, and it's nice to see the red command rank uniforms actually LOOK red instead of slightly reddish-pink, for a change, I don't feel that it's THAT much better that I'm willing to throw away my STNG DVDs (which look pretty darn good on an up-scaling DVD player) and spend a fortune on the Blu-Rays.

Then again, if you never bought the DVDs and have been holding out for this, then you'll want it.

I'd recommend getting this teaser Blu-Ray before making a decision, as it will give you a good taste of what's coming.",1329350400,3,3851,4.480741797432239
2776009,5,B000NOKP12,"Ever since being a kid and watching this show I have never purchased a set of episodes. At first because it was not in seasons and only a few episodes on a VHS.  Then as the seasons came out television sets and sound systems were getting better.  So, I decided to bet that it would be redone one day, so when I saw this I immediately picked it up to get a sample of what I have been waiting for all of these years. The re-animated graphics blend nicely with what was pulled from the film.  The film has that grainy look that makes it look classic, the colors really jump out, and the remixed sound is nice.  This was a perfect appetizer for the main courses to come later.  I would have liked a few special features, but being a sampler and only costing $15 I'm not going to complain.

It would have been nice to see a new CG Enterprise D, but they did a great job with the old model shots.

- Price - We all know they're going to milk the actual box sets for every penny they can. So the fact that this preview was so reasonable was nice.

Con's:

- Image quality is excellent. The direct film conversion really brings out the detail, including the stuff you don't want to see. Nothing like seeing ""Q"" ride in on a plywood box. (We all should have been expecting this, so I didn't mark off for it.)

- 7.1 Audio - Seems to be ""missing something"" that I can't really put my finger on. While they did a good job of remixing the sound to surround, it's not quite right. Seems empty and hallow.

- Episode selection is a little bit questionable. While the Inner Light is easily one of the Top 5 episodes, it doesn't show off much in regards to the visual effects we can expect to see. Then to throw in Encounter at Farpoint and Sins of the Father... yawn.",1329264000,,1189,4.426605504587156

I did watch the videos online about comparing the old/new side by side, and even on crappy online video (not blu ray) it looks great. I have the original series on blu ray and was hoping they'd get to this soon. Why am I conflicted? well i do not want to buy this and then buy the seasons because that would be redundant, however I wonder if the sales of this disc are high enough they will rush out the seasons. or if it sells poorly maybe they'll hold back. One thing I know is that star trek fans are loyal. Over the years I've seen Star Trek repackaged and sold in different ways. such as Columbia House (which was nice but they never played them in order) then on the two episode discs (which were also nice, they looked much better than I had ever seen up until then, but two episodes for $14.99 plus the fact that you had many many discs to buy seemed silly) then I started buying the seasons (which were nice but pricey. I did like the colored plastic cases though it matched nothing else in my collection) I also started buying the TNG series on dvd but at $99.99 a pop that was a bit much, so I ended up not buying many) But, then Blu Ray was winning, and so I wanted to just hold off and buy them that way. and I did like how TOS had both the old/new versions of the show on the same disc (something Star Wars should have done) but I ended up watching the newer versions. I love star trek but i'm not that much of a purist. I liked how the updated effects didn't cause the show to lose any of it's cheese-factor, but definitely upped the wow-factor. It was a product of its time and the updates just made it that much better. also with Blu Ray I've never paid over $55 on Amazon (plus I get free shipping) so that puts it way ahead of the old dvds. Also I am conflicted cause I want to see this really really bad. And I have to wait for the seasons. But they did pick pretty good episodes to start us on. As a preview the price is right and if you are not a total fan and are on the curious side, this is a great way to start, it will definitely make a fan out of you, but if you are serious about Trek you will probably be like me and wait for the seasons. They should have given this one a collectible, so that collectors like me would buy it for the bonus item and that way we won't feel cheated by buying the preview and then the seasons. Just a thought. But I love what Trek represents, it's great science fiction story telling. And worth getting on Blu Ray. When I say that fans are loyal that doesn't mean they'll buy just any ol' crap. I will say this paramount may milk the hell out of this franchise but they just don't keep repackaging old stuff, they go through a lot of work to make it work on the new mediums. They know that fans will buy any new format out there, because trek has such a strong following, but they don't take advantage of that. They know if they put out a quality product the sales will be there, so they take their time and do it right. The TOS and Twilight Zone are the best examples of old shows getting royal treatment on Blu Ray, and what is even more wonderful is that these shows have been taken care of over the years, probably because they are so loved, that when you see it on the new formats, you are still impressed with the overall sound/video quality.

2776015,4,B000NOKP12,"Later this year Star Trek: The Next Generation will celebrate its 25th anniversary.  Twenty-five years is a long time, if you recall the Star Trek franchise was only 21 years old when TNG premiered.  I, on the other hand was a little over 5 years when `Next Gen' blew into my life at warp speed and irreparably changed my taste in TV & movies forever.  As a kid and even well into my teens I was never really bothered by the relatively poor quality of the show because I didn't know any different.  With each passing year home video technology has improved, it is now to a point to where a show that I once thought looked cutting edge now looks decidedly poor and without any of the glory it once held.  Thankfully due to several factors including the success of 2009's Star Trek reboot, the Original Series successful high definition restoration, continued interest in TNG, and TNG's upcoming 25th 'birthday' Paramount and CBS Films decided last year to commit to restoring The Next Generation so that future generations may enjoy for years to come.

Star Trek The Next Generation is beaming down on Blu-ray courtesy of a sampler disc that is not so cleverly titled '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-Next-Level-Blu-ray/dp/B0064NLQYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek: The Next Generation - Next Level [Blu-ray</a>]' that includes three TNG episodes housed on a single Blu-ray disc.  The three episodes chosen for this sampler disc are the feature length pilot episode Encounter at Farpoint, the third season episode Sins of the Father, and the fifth season Hugo Award Winner The Inner Light.

Film Rating: 4 out of 5 stars

Both casual and die hard fans of the show might be left a little perplexed as to why these particular episodes were chosen.  I can't say with any certainty why these three episodes were chosen; Paramount and CBS Films have been rather tight lipped about their reasoning but I do have a few theories.

Encounter at Farpoint-  Most Star Trek fans would agree that TNG's pilot episode isn't a very good episode.  It does a pretty good job of introducing all of the characters including one of the franchises more enduring villains but in a lot of ways it's a very bad episode.  The writing is very wooden, some characters bare very little resemblance to the characters they would later become, and the show's look on a technical level leaves a lot to be desired.  The first two seasons of TNG have a much softer look than the remainder of the series and that's especially true during Encounter at Farpoint.  Not only are the special effects incredibly soft but the entire episode is very soft even when compared to other first season episodes.  A lot of this has to do with the how TNG was shot which was quite a departure to how most shows were done at the time.  TNG was shot on film but was edited on video which led to the show's soft look.  Eventually the technology and the process involved improved and in terms of overall quality the shows began to look much better by season three.

The fact that the first episode is a logical place to start a sampler disc and that Encounter at Farpoint is one of the series ""ugliest"" episodes is why I think this episode was included on the disc.  Encounter at Farpoint is not one of TNG's heavier action packed, special effects filled episodes but it will be one that will showoff the improvements that remastering the show in HD can pull off.  Like the Original Series, TNG is receiving retouched special effects; shots featuring the Enterprise have been re-scanned from the original camera negatives because editing the show on video rendered those effects unusable because they are forever stuck in a 480P/SD purgatory.  Some CGI has been applied but it so far does not look out of place and as you'll see later actually makes many shots looks a lot better because it replaces some of the TNG's cost cutting special effects butchering like reusing old effects from previous Star Trek movies like The Search for Spock.

Sins of the Father-  This is one TNG's first continuing storylines which is something that the franchise had been avoiding due to Gene Roddenberry's desire to have the series have self contained episodes where everything is neatly wrapped up for the next episode.  Sins of the Father isn't heavy on special effects but it does have the honor of being the first episode to show the Klingon homeworld brought to life courtesy of matte paintings that now look great after being remastered in HD.  The opening shot of the Enterprise and the Klingon Bird of Prey has also been improved by replacing the old Bird of Prey footage from Star Trek III with a new CGI Bird of Prey that looks light years better than its SD counterpart.

The Inner Light-  Widely considered to be one the series best episodes and is Patrick Stewart's favorite episode.  This might be the most perplexing episode on the sampler disc since it has very few typical Star Trek special effects such as space battles or phaser fights but it does have some impressive remastered matte paintings and complex aging makeup especially in regard to Picard.  It might not be the most obvious choice for the sampler disc but it does show off how good the writing is on TNG and how subtly the re-composition and CGI can reinvigorate an aging show.

Video Quality: 5 out of 5 stars

To say this Blu-ray is a revelation is an understatement.  It surpassed my expectations in almost every conceivable way.  The most notable improvement is in terms of resolution but to a certain degree the added resolution is a double edged sword.  The added clarity is for the most part wonderful but you'll also notice a lot more imperfections in the sets, uniforms, and in the show in general.  With that said none of those imperfections bothered me one bit as I felt it added a bit of old school charm to the show.  Aside from the dramatic improvement in resolution you'll also notice that colors pop; if you need proof just take a look a look at the red, blue, and gold uniforms and how they compare to their washed out SD cousins.  Black levels are also greatly improved with shots being damn near inky instead of just a dark, dark blue or grey.  There's a thin layer of grain present that might catch some viewers off guard, it's perfectly natural and just wasn't visible before because of the low resolution of Standard Definition.

There have been some complaints about TNG's aspect ratio not being updated to 16:9 to fit widescreen televisions and instead being left in its original 4:3 aspect ratio.  As a bit of a film purest I have absolutely no issue with the show being kept in its original aspect ratio because it retains the original director's and cinematographer's composition.  Changing TNG to 16:9 would require re-framing the entire show by zooming in and cropping the 4:3 image and a large portion of the original onscreen information would be lost which is just as unacceptable to me as colorizing a black & white movie or what George Lucas has done to Star Wars.  What eagle eyed viewers may notice however is the image is slightly larger than the Netflix or DVD counterpart.  A very small amount of cropping was applied to the top and bottom of the frame while the left and right portions have been expanded to include just a little more information.  It's only really noticeable through direct side-by-side comparison but I thought it was worth mentioning.

Audio Quality: 4 out of 5 stars

Back in 2002 when TNG was released on DVD a big deal was made of it being remixed in Dolby Digital 5.1 but unfortunately it wasn't as big of a deal as Paramount made it out to be.  TNG was originally broadcast in stereo but even after a 5.1 remix the soundtrack was extremely front heavy with the surround speakers only being used sparingly.  For this release and for future complete seasons TNG will be released in DTS-HD MA 7.1 and in DTS-HD MA 2.0 soundtracks.  Both sound excellent; the 7.1 soundtrack still doesn't sound as good as any of the Star Trek feature films but at the same time none of these episodes are particularly action packed.  Photon torpedoes, the jump to warp speed, and the general noises of the Enterprise all sound great however and the ambient noise is more precise than the 10 year old DVD counterpart.  Jerry Goldsmith's opening credit theme and the show's normal music also sound better than I've ever heard them before with perhaps the exception being when I've heard Jerry Goldsmith's theme in several theatrical presentations.  Dialogue is always crystal clear, well focused in the center channel, and appropriately punchy when need be.  For those looking to enjoy TNG in a more 1987 sort of way the 2.0 track will more than suffice.  The 2.0 track isn't quite as good; your subwoofer and surround speakers won't get as much of a workout but the main sound stage is perfectly serviceable and dialogue is still clear as a bell.

Special Features: 1 out of 5 stars

If you're looking for a lot of special features than you're going to be disappointed but keep in mind that this is only a sampler disc which is meant to ""wet your whistle"" for the upcoming full seasons.  The only extras included on this release are:

Star Trek The Next Generation Season One Trailer
There are some new clips from several season one episodes.
Star Trek PADD
iPad App Promo
A Hint of HD ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" HD Teaser Promo
Original promo for the Sampler

Conclusion: 4 out of 5 stars

So should you pick up this sampler disc?  Truthfully I don't know, it depends on how big of a Star Trek fan you are.  It's not particularly expensive, it can be picked up for about $15 but it does only contain three episodes with almost zero special features.  In my honest opinion if you're fan of the show this is an easy way to show your support (and interest) in seeing The Next Generation on Blu-ray.  CBS and Paramount are spending a lot of money on remastering this series and their continued support might come down to how well this disc and TNG's first season sell later this year.  For me it was a no-brainer and now that I've seen some of the finished project I'm even more excited about TNG on Blu-ray than I was before.  While the episodes they chose to put on this sampler disc might perplex some the end results are nothing less than spectacular.  This is as close as you're going to get to experiencing The Next Generation again for the first time outside of suffering from amnesia or Alzheimer's.  I highly recommend it... Make it So!

2776036,5,B000NOKP12,"So yes, I feel a little slighted that there's only three episodes.  Good choices though.  Farpoint of course being the obvious first choice, it looks very clean and the effects are much, much better.  Gone are the blurry overlays and painted planets.

The other two episodes are classics all around, but aren't very visually stunning in terms of effects.  Also, I'm assuming all the coming seasons will be in 4:3 format, not widescreen, though I hope I'm wrong.  Someone told me long ago that TNG, DS9, and Voyager were all filmed in 4:3.  However, that may have just been a rumor.

If you are a Star Trek fan, go ahead and get this.  It will be many years before all the seasons come out so it's a good taste of what's to come.  As for me, I have no plans to buy the seasons as they come out on Blu-ray.  I bought all the DVDs sets upon release at close to $100 a box.  While I've gotten good use out of them I'm not planning to spend that much again.

But 'Sins of the Father' and 'Inner Light' are just excellent prototypical TNG episodes. Character driven, story-driven, emotional, challenging our conceptions of what it means to be human. Not a lot of special effects, but really TNG wasn't about the special effects.

Like everyone else, I love the sound, picture quality and fidelity to the intentions of the original creators. There were a few hiccups. In 'encounter at farpoint' there was a moment when Picard faces Q in the court for the first time, one of the camera angles facing Picard has shadows on the forehead that I think are an artifact of film damage.

2776044,5,B000NOKP12,"Fans have been waiting for a long time to see Star Trek: The Next Generation on Blu-ray.  After years of rumors, CBS/Paramount has offered this teaser disc.

Some background: TNG was shot on 35mm film, then converted to video tape for editing.  For this Blu-ray, the producers have gone back to the original film elements and reassembled the footage.  Most of the visual effects are newly composited from the original elements.  Some effects which originated in video (e. g, phaser shots) or were originally done in CGI have been recreated in HD.  In some ways, the reconstruction here is more difficult than for the Original Series, where everything was done on film and the effects were simply replaced.

The visual improvement here is striking: colors are much more vibrant, reds do not bleed and blacks are deep.  The number of details I noticed in HD are too numerous to mention, but just a few: colored piping on the trouser legs, text on computer consoles and door labels, texture on carpet.  In the SD opening credits, I noticed a person walking in the Observation Lounge just before the Enterprise's warp out - in HD, I can detect two people, and see the uniform color.  Previously, I'd felt the TNG lighting style was flat, but in HD, I can see the subtlety of each shot.  As with the original series, the improved clarity also highlights bloopers, including a stuntman version of Data, and flaws in Brent Spiner's makeup.  Also, in HD the bridge set seems strangely spare and cavernous - I can easily see why it was beefed up with additional work stations for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Generations/dp/B002XISFI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Generations</a>.  The producers have not gotten carried away with digital scrubbing, and several shots have a reasonable amount of film grain.

The sample episodes are well chosen here: they each come from different times in the series life, with their own distinct dramatic tone, sporting diverse looks - Sins of the Father in particular has al dark, gritty feel during the Klingon homeworld sequences.

The producers were up front enough to place a disclaimer that 13 seconds of Sins of the Father is upconverted from SD due to a missing film element - one can plainly see the difference, although even here the picture quality is superior to the SD DVD.

Some have criticized the producers for not converting this set to 16:9 widescreen.  Having seen an attempt to convert Gone with the Wind to widescreen that ruined the composition of that film, I want to commend the producers' decision to maintain the integrity of the original production.  TNG HD is in 4:3 as was originally filmed and intended.  If you don't like it, hit the zoom button on your remote, or don't buy the disc.

The audio has been upgraded to 7.1, and sounds better than the 5.1 DVD, but not by a whole lot.  Of course, either are head and shoulders above the original 2-channel broadcast, which was compressed when aired.  Audio options also exist for Spanish, French, German, and Japanese, and subtitles are in a plethora of languages.  The extras consist of a few short trailers.",1328572800,3,3156,4.992351816443595
2776045,5,B000NOKP12,"As a rule - I don't give five stars.  But for this item, I shall make an exception.  When I first saw the HD version of the original series, with all the new special effects done for that series, I was blown away.  I did not think that a treatment like would ever be possible for The Next Generation.  For one, I had thought that TNG was filmed in video, not celluloid.  Thank goodness I was wrong.  There isn't much I can say that had not already been touched upon by other reviewers.  Only that there should have been a discount coupon, or something, in the package to buy the new Blu-ray release of the series.

2776066,5,B000NOKP12,"Due to the video editing process that TNG episodes went through no one has ever seen the show presented in this amazing quality until ""Next Level"".  I never expected anyone to care enough about this series to give it the type of treatment we see here.  Going back to the original camera negatives and recreating the entire process from there is an remarkable achievement.

And it shows.

The quality of the re-editing and transfer is top notch.  The show's artists obviously spent a lot of time working on details they knew would never be appreciated.  These details are now visible and I hope at least some of them will look at their newly revealed work and smile.

Years ago I purchased the Inner Light on Laserdisc because I enjoyed the story so much.  As luck would have it, Inner Light was one of the episodes on this sampler.  Though I loved the story the Laserdisc transfer from the video edit was very disappointing.  That Laserdisc and the original edits of Star Wars are the only reason I have kept my Laserdisc player for so long.  This Blu-ray removes one of those reasons.  And it may even encourage me to return for more in order to experience the series as never before.

Some technical comments.  Though we're not used to it, the show is displayed in it's proper pillar boxed aspect ratio format.  I do notice some specs pop up either due to dirty negatives or damage.  It could have used a bit more cleaning up.  I'm pleased to see the film grain present.  The audio was never intended to be reproduced in such a revealing and sophisticated format and the light touch to the remix works well for me.

As a viewer who loved the Next Generation, but always HATED the image quality of the show, even back during it's first run, when we were all watching on standard resolution CRT TVs (which should have hidden some of the sins of the editing process. The show was shot on film, but edited on (apparently poor) video).

For the first time (outside the feature films), we have the Enterprise-D looking sharp and detailed, against an inky black starscape. The actors and sets no longer look fuzzy and ill defined, and the new 7.1 surround mix works wonderfully (immersive, without being in your face enough to force you to pay special attention to it's upgrade, drawing you out of the show.)

The only real question for TNG fans is obviously, do you NEED this release at all, when the complete Season 1 complete boxed set will be out later this year, and the plan is two seasons a year being produced in 2013 on. For myself, I'd say it's worth the 15 bucks or so just to check out what was done on an HD bigscreen.

2776072,5,B000NOKP12,"Footage Is Commendable But Needs Gamma Adjustment...

I just received my new Star Trek: The Next Level bluray today and just got through watching Encounter at Farpoint and is just now starting the episode, Sins of the Father.  I'd like to offer my opinions and observations about the disc thus far...

The footage looks great, fantastic, better than it has ever looked before.  But there is one problem with the footage mentioned by others that I can confirm:  the shadows and the blacks in the footage have been adjusted toward the darker side.  Meaning, the blacks and the shadows in the footage are ""very"" black - so black until there is a complete and total lost of shadow detail in the shadows of almost every scene.  I've watched literally hundreds of Bluray movies with the exact same TV and the exact same settings, and this is the first Bluray I've ever encountered or watched where the blacks in the movie were ""overly"" black.  Sure, most people love deep rich blacks, so do I.  And I'm sure the studio only adjusted the blacks like that to make the image ""pop"" and ""shine"".  But the problem is, increasing the blacks in most cases will also swallow up the shadow detail.  For a good example of this, the black fabric of the Enterprise crew member's uniforms should at least look like it is woven black fabric.  But in the movie, those patches of black fabric on their uniforms are ""totally"" black, so black until you can see no weave in the fabric and no details, it's just a flat inky black.  Black fabric in real life does NOT look like that.  You should still be able to see some details in the fabric even though it is black.  But in the movie, you see absolutely no details and no weave, just total black.  And that's not cool.  And that's the problem with the way the footage has been mastered...

But the good news is, there is a solution for the problem.  I have a Toshiba HDTV, and it has a ""Gamma Control"" in Preferences.  The Gamma Control directly controls the density of blacks in a scene.  Therefore, I went into my settings and simply changed the Gamma Control from a setting of ""plus 1"" - to a setting of ""plus 5"" (the highest setting).  That single adjustment ""lightened"" up the blacks as well as the midrange without blowing out the highlights.  The difference it made in the picture was like night and day.  Out of the box the picture looked great, even commendable.  But with the small gamma change I made, the image now looks ""spectacular"" even ""mind-blowing"" - and I can honestly say with the adjustment the movie can now compete with the best Blurays ever created.  Yes, the movie does still have some noticeable grain in it, but I'd much rather see fine grain in the film than ""smeary"" compression artifacts any day.  As an example of this, the other Star Trek Blurays already released, ""First Contact"" and ""Insurrection"", they look great and doesn't have the same overly dark shadow problem, but the type of compression they used on those movies looks horrible.  In those movies if they show you a clump of trees off in the distance, if you look closely at those trees, you won't see any fine detail. All you'll see is just a brown and greenish smudge, colors that simulate trees, almost like finger paint.  On the other hand, any imagery that is close up will have plenty of details.  And that is the consequence of the type compression they used.  So I'm certainly glad they didn't use that same compression on this Next Level Bluray.  I'd much rather see fine grain in the movie any day than smeary details.  So if your television is blessed with Gamma Control, I highly recommend you try adjusting that control in the positive direction to brighten up the shadows while watching your TNG Next Level bluray. I think you'll notice a dramatic even spectacular improvement in picture quality.  I certainly did.

I also sincerely hope that Paramount reads these notes and makes a similar Gamma adjustment on their master footage before releasing the final version to the public.  Yes, the work they did is commendable and the resultant footage looks great.  But with a minor gamma adjustment to brighten up the darkest shadows - that same footage could look a whole lot better - even spectacular....",1328313600,4,4234,4.627345844504021

2776099,5,B000NOKP12,"I finally got my ""next level"" blu-ray today, which I had pre-ordered a few weeks ago.  I sat down and watched all three episodes this evening.  Wow, it truly is quite a thing to behold!  I never dreamt Star Trek: The Next Generation could look this good.  I have a nice 7.1 home theater system and found myself also very impressed by the dts-HD master audio as well.

I have been following the story of this project for several years, and began to wonder if it would ever happen, due to the enormous cost.  I must give CBS home entertainment a lot of credit for taking this very expensive gamble, and for doing it so well.  As others have said, the studio has stayed very faithful to the original intent of the creators of this series.  But they have managed to make the series look far, far better than it did on DVD, and sound far better as well.  The colors, the detail, the clarity of the special effects--it's all just beautiful to behold.  This is a great example of modern digital technology being used for good, not for evil!!  The technology has been used to restore and preserve a very important part of television history.  If you love this series, you owe it to yourself to check out this sampler of what's to come.  It will probably make you very excited about the season box sets which will start to be available later this year.

If you buy this expecting it to look like a movie made in 2012, you're bound to be disappointed.  This is a series that was made for television 25 years ago.  It was filmed in 4x3 and has been remastered that way.  It retains the graininess that was always there, but I actually found this to be only a minor distraction from time to time.  What's amazing is how good it really does look and sound without having been altered in any fundamental way.

Watching these three particular episodes also reminded me just how much the series evolved over time.  The story telling really improved and became more sophisticated.  I can't wait to see more, especially starting with season 3 when the show really took off.

This blu-ray release is a lovely affirmation of the enduring legacy of Star Trek.  We can only hope that all the television series, especially DS9, will eventually get the same  faithful restoration.",1328227200,2,2256,4.5272277227722775

2776101,3,B000NOKP12,"I finally had the chance to take a look at the long anticipated Next Gen Blu Ray. I never expected Next Gen to appear in HD format as  I thought it had all been shot on low-quality video rather than film. Seems only the effects shots were done in video and they've been remastered for the HD release.

Sound Quality: Brilliant - it's 7.1 surround though the original stereo tracks are there for purists.

Video Quality: The episodes look pretty darn good though I expected them to have a bit more detail in them. That's probably down to my aging eyes though. I remember TNG as being shot with low-contrast lighting and always being a bit fuzzy, a result of it having being shot on video. I never liked the low-contrast look as it made the episodes look a bit wan. The only time I thought they got the lighting right was in Yesterday's Enterprise which had a more stark lighting. Lighting was used to good effect in TOS, but it was a type of film making eschewed in the late 80s.

With this HD release, they've tweaked the contrast so there's less of a washed out look and colors are more punchy. Detail is good. All the effects shots were redone in HD but in the opening sequence of Encounter at Farpoint, where the camera pans over the Enterprise, my first though was ""it looks like a model"" not a real ship. HD has good and bad aspects.

Now to my real gripe: the episodes are presented in 4:3 format. Yes, I know they were originally shot in 4:3 and broadcast in 4:3 but I found the format a bit claustrophobic to watch. They felt very boxed in. And rather than being pulled into the episodes, the black bars kept pulling me out of the episodes.

TOS was released on HD in 4:3 format as well, as it too was shot in that format. However, watching its episodes, the black bars never intruded on my enjoyment of an episode. That said, CBS did do a 16:9 version of the remastered TOS which was for broadcast. I only saw it in standard def, but they took the time to reframe shots rather than simply zooming in to the center till a 16:9 rectangle was filled. It looked fantastic. That's the set I wish they had released on Blu Ray. Unfortunately, it's never been released but I'd double-dip for that set.

4:3 doesn't appeal to modern audiences, even to those of us who grew up watching it. If you're going to reframe a 4:3 format into 16:9. then you are going to lose some parts of the picture. In most cases, with proper reframing, nothing of importance will be lost.

I feel that a huge opportunity has been lost here to attract modern audiences to TNG (and TOS) by issuing the sets in their original 4:3 aspect ratio. Ideally, both versions would be available on the on set of Blu Rays so the consumer has the choice to watch their preferred version. They did that in a way with the TOS release giving the option to watch the episodes with the original effects or with the remastered effects. And CBS have shown (with TOS) that they can reframe episodes in 16:9 format without compromising them.

Star Trek sets have never been cheap on DVD or Blu Ray and never seem to fall in price as the years pass. Much as I like TNG, and much as I love HD, I won't be buying any of the TNG Seasons on Blu Ray simply because they're in 4:3 format.

I want to be pulled into the worlds that play across my HD TV. I want a visual field that closely matches the ratio of what I see in the real world and 16:9 does that better than 4:3.

It's a matter of personal taste. Film-makers may say that episodes were shot in 4:3 and framed for that format because that's what they wanted or that's what was available at the time and reframing for 16:9 is altering their vision of the episode (e.g. Joss Whedon on early seasons of Buffy). I don't like 4:3 any more because there's almost always a sensation of looking at the TV though blinkers. I'd be very surprised if I was alone in that viewpoint. I want to watch widescreen stuff. Some series can get away with being 4:3. TNG, for me, isn't one of them. I want to see wide-open space vistas and alien planets not a boxed-in, tunnel-vision view.

That's why I think issuing TNG HD in 4:3 is a missed opportunity. It won't appeal to modern audiences and relies pretty much exclusively on the existing fan-base to buy into it, double or triple-dipping as most will already own TNG on DVD (a not inexpensive set when it was released).

2776102,5,B000NOKP12,"Like I said, it looks AMAZING! The detail is so enhanced everything just pops!
I don't think I could ever bring myself to watch the original SD version again after seeing this.
You can literally see every hair on every head. And often you can see stray hairs oddly sticking out.
Which brings me to the too much of a good thing bit.
The detail is so find that you can see little imperfections here and there. As others have said in these comments, you can sometimes notice seams in the carpet on the bridge and other things that slightly pull you out of the show and remind you that you're looking at a set. And certain close up shots of the Enterprise look... like a model.
The visual effects for the transporter beams is so clear that it almost doesn't look the same. When I first saw it I felt it didn't look as good as the SD version where it's imperfections were blurred with the lower resolution of that format.
Oh, and Riker's chest hairs can be seen popping out above his uniform. Ha! Never noticed that before.
In the end though, holy crap, it all looks great.
It seems like they color graded it as well. There are some scenes in Sins of the Father that look FANTASTIC color-wise.

2776104,5,B000NOKP12,"I think the pure beauty of this HD remastering job has been stated plenty in the other reviews, but it most certainly can't be overstated. I grew up watching Next Generation religiously but I might as well have never seen it before with this adaptation.
The important things to note on top of the pure beauty and dynamic sound is what they DIDN'T do. This is not a special edition. They didn't touch up the effects. No CGI, no reworking, no edits... no Greedo shooting first. The show remains as it was meant to be, but presented how it never could have been before. The effects of the Farpoint creatures in particular show how much work went into designing them and show how much of an achievement this show was back in 1989.
The other thing I think is important for potential buyers to understand is that this is just a sampler. It's a preview of the season sets to come. There are no extras to speak of besides a few advertisements and it's only 3 episodes. It's 3 good episodes and I don't regret at all the money I spent on this, but know what you're buying or you may be disappointed here.
But again, this is by no means a disappointing buy. Enjoy a few of the best episodes of Next Generation in a way you've never seen before, and for a reasonable price... It's a win by my standards.",1328140800,6,1292,4.3429752066115705

2776126,5,B000NOKP12,"This is in reply to all the ""It's not fair, it doesn't fill my TV... why do I have these black borders at the sides?"" people:

The ratio on the Blu-ray discs is the same as it ever was for Star Trek: The Next Generation. Same as it was shot in, same as it was broadcast in, same as it was presented on VHS and the same as it was presented on DVD. Why on earth some people expect Blu-ray to magically alter this situation is beyond me, but you only have to note the two and one star reviews to see they are. The series was filmed in 4:3, a quarter of a century ago, long before anyone envisaged that we'd all have 16:9 widescreen TV's in our homes in the future. ""But I could make my Star Trek TNG DVD's play in widescreen"", I hear you cry. No, actually you couldn't. What you were doing was stretching or zooming the image to fill your widescreen TV. This is fake widescreen, and something purists never do, but was quite easy to achieve with a standard definition DVD, on a standard definition DVD player, over a standard definition connection. This is HD though, and stretching or faking widescreen is not really an option. ""Why?"", I hear you cry. Well, HDTV resolutions are either 720p or 1080i/p... 1280x720 or 1920x1080. These are 16:9 'widescreen' resolutions by default. This means that your Blu-ray player HAS to display everything as a 16:9 image. In the case of films and TV shows shot and framed for cinema or 16:9 broadcast, it will fill your widescreen TV. Sometimes with small black borders at the top and bottom if they have chosen to present the original cinematic ratio. Now, when they are presenting a 4:3 image on HD Blu-ray... this same rule applies. It HAS to be displayed as part of a 16:9 frame. Meaning the 4:3 picture displayed correctly in the middle of the screen, and two black bars, one either side of your TV's screen, which all forms the 16:9 frame. It is pretty much unavoidable.

""But wasn't there more screen information on the 35mm negatives"", you may ask. Well Mike Okuda has said in some scenes there was. Not all, but *some*. However, in many of the scenes there was lights stands, bare studio, crew and other equipment in the wider frame. In other words, it was framed *purely* for 4:3 broadcast.

So zooming and pan scanning was the only other alternative. I have ONE DVD set that had this treatment out of the thousands I own. The TV series 'From Earth to the Moon'. This was shot and framed for 4:3 broadcast, and it was released in America in the correct ratio. However, when it released in the UK, for some bizarre reason, they decided to zoom the image out to 16:9. The result is not pretty... you think those black bars at the side of the screen are ugly? You have not seen ugly! From Earth to the Moon in Region 2 DVD is the most claustrophobic and fuzzy mess you will ever witness. There was also a huge public outcry when they recently did this same thing to The World at War documentary series, and people returned their box sets in droves. It literally means that in closely shot scenes, of which there many in Star Trek: TNG, that people's faces are cut off at the eyebrows, and legs are cut off at the knees. Further, it will no longer be true HD as you are zooming the image. Think passport photo blew up to A4 size. In other words, it is FAR too much of a sacrifice to even contemplate for something as cherished as Star Trek. Had they done this to Star Trek, there would have been an outrcry from fans, and they wouldn't be selling too many box sets. Of that I can assure you. Plus, the people charged to see that this franchise is represented the best way it can be, people like Mike and Densise Okuda, who oversaw this restoration, could never sanction such a travesty.

So I can only suggest you try get used to those black borders at the sides, as if you have a fondness for anything filmed for TV from this era or before, that is how your Blu-ray discs will come. It is the same for Star Trek: The Original Series on Blu-ray, seasons 1-3 of Farscape on Blu-ray... anything and everything that was shot for 4:3 broadcast. It is also true of many films, such as It's a Wonderful Life on Blu-ray, and very old films like The Wizard of Oz. All of these come with fixed black borders in HD. It isn't some sinister Big Brother forcing you to watch it a certain way, it is literally the only way they can present 4:3 without totally ruining the composition. The good news is that everyone goes through this stage when they first play 4:3 on their widescreen sets. At first you can't help but be conscious of the offending black bars. However, hand on heart, I never even see them now, and many people will tell you the same. Your brain just cancels them out. It just takes time, and a little appreciation for why this situation happens.

Back to the Star Trek The Next Generation: The Next Level on Blu-ray:

It is superb. There are details no one has ever seen before. This series may have been shot on 35mm film, but it was edited and stored on videotape. Even on DVD we were watching videotape resolution and quality. I believe one popular sci-fi magazine had nicknamed it ""Blurry Trek"" in a preview from before it was even broadcast. All that is in the past now, or at least it will be when we can buy all seven seasons on Blu-ray. Unlike with Star Trek: TOS Remastered, which I loved, they have not chosen to re-create the special effects scenes in CGI. Instead, they have re-composited the images from the original negatives (a far more lengthy and costly exercise than new CGI). So what we are seeing is the original effects and the original studio models in all their HD glory. Elsewhere, they have lovingly restored every last frame, freeing it of dust and debris. The grain structure is still in tact, meaning no sacrifice in fine detail from the use of DNR filtering. The result is beautiful. Colours and contrast are perfect... rich, deep blacks and vibrantly coloured Starfleet uniforms. One of the biggest let downs for me as regards the DVD sets was that they didn't try and restore the series a little back then. This meant washed out VHS quality colours. Not so here, I'm pleased to report.

The sound is impressive when listening to it in the context of the era it was made. It is not a modern summer blockbuster made with multichannel audio, it was only ever recorded in stereo. So they have fashioned a 7.1 surround sound mix from what they had. With this in mind, I am impressed with both levels and channel separation. Decent speakers will punch the air in all the right places, mark my words.

In summary, it is a huge success. Pre-orders for the complete season sets will be the easiest purchasing decisions I will ever make.",1328140800,197,6703,4.435064935064935
2776127,5,B000NOKP12,"Just watched Encounter at Farpoint on the Star Trek: The Next Generation - The Next Level.  The restoration is spectacular!  It felt like I was losing my Star Trek virginity again.  The first beauty shot of the Enterprise D brought tears to my eyes.  You can see the light flare through every tiny window, and the blazing glow of the warp nacelles never had such power.  The saucer separation gives a bird's eye view of the extraordinary detail of the original model--detail we could never see before--all the blues and greens on the hull and undiscovered textures!  The digital elements--the phaser blasts, Q cage and photon torpedoes are fantastic and seamlessly integrated into the original film elements.  Though lacking behind the scenes on the restoration, the menu gives you a taste of the season 1 interface, with a Next Gen, Purple/Gold branching display and schematics of the ship, similar to the interactive menus on the original series Blu Rays. The remastered sound has tremendous depth and separation.  Wow. Five galaxies of stars!",1328140800,3,1045,5.034883720930233
2776128,5,B000NOKP12,"This TNG Blu-ray is a gorgeous new look at our old friend Star Trek: The Next Generation.  I grew up on the series, it was my absolute childhood favorite, and I still love the show.  From my old recorded VHS tapes to the DVD boxsets, TNG has long been trapped in a less-than-stellar medium.  While the DVDs got the job done, the show was definitely showing its age.  Because it was edited on video, many pessimists across the web figured there would never been a genuine HD presentation of TNG.

Thankfully on the approach to its 25th anniversary CBS has begun the massive project of returning to the original film negatives and reconstructing the show in HD.  Having now viewed this sampling of their work I can say this project is a great way to honor TNG's legacy and truly worth the re-purchasing of the show.  The new HD transfer really makes colors pop, and the fine detail is infinitely better than the old DVDs.  Best of all are the original special effects in all their old-school miniature glory!

""Encounter At Farpoint"":  TNG's first episode, though lacking somewhat in storytelling and some of the performances, finds new life in the HD transfer.  The special effects in this episode are gorgeous.  The scenes featuring the Enterprise are absolutely striking and far more interesting to me than the most overloaded CGI scene from modern movies.  It was a lot of fun seeing the new fine detail presented here, from the fantastic model work done on the Enterprise to the decoration of the individual sets.

Unfortunately you can now see little flaws that might have been missed on the original releases.  The first I noticed being bits of fluff on the carpets of the bridge, I guess housekeeping didn't vacuum the carpets before the Enterprise left spacedock!  Data's facial makeup during the holodeck scenes is a bit lacking too (and his stunt double for Wesley's ""rescue"" is easy to spot).  The matte paintings (though revealing of TNG's age) look much better here.  You can really appreciate the detail put into them by the scenic artists, kudos to those that created them.  The biggest surprise came at the end of the episode, the jellyfish creatures meeting in space looked absolutely fantastic.  They are actually beautiful in HD, the detail and color is much improved over the old SD version.

So to summarize, even though Encounter At Farpoint is a somewhat flawed opening to TNG, I appreciate the seeds planted here, eventually growing into an absolutely wonderful show.  One thing though, while I am thankful that CBS opted not to replace the effects with CGI or monkey with the show as much as they did on TOS, couldn't they have replaced the man-skirt uniforms with standard outfits?  Or maybe gotten rid of Troi's cheerleader costume?  ;-)

""Sins of the Father"": Ahhh!  Wesley's got acne!  Yes, with the newfound detail it'll be easier to spot our crew's human imperfections as was the case in this Ten Forward scene.  The amusing banquet scene with Kurn was more lively for me on this HD viewing, I can actually identify the food they are eating now.  And how about those utensils?  I wouldn't be able to stand those forks.

Things get going once Worf and Kurn have their little show down, the Enterprise warps to Qo'noS (still unnamed and known only as the Klingon Homeworld at that time).  The matte paintings here look fantastic, brought to life by the flash of lightning and several figures walking amongst the buildings (I never noticed the people in earlier viewings).  The Klingon costumes and makeup all look great in this episode as well.  Though this episode is somewhat light on special effects, it still looks much better than before.  The Klingon culture was really fleshed out in this episode, and this new HD release makes everything look great.

If you've been following the news surrounding this Blu-ray release you've likely heard about the missing film footage of Dr. Crusher arriving on the bridge to deliver news to Commander Riker regarding a second survivor of the Khitomer Massacre.  Unfortunately this brief scene does stick out like a sore thumb.  One moment we're in crisp HD, the next we're back in 1990 with the old fuzzy footage.  Thankfully it's brief, and with any luck they'll find the footage later in the restoration process in time for the forthcoming Season 3 release.  I certainly hope these hiccups don't occur often!

""The Inner Light"": One of TNG's best episodes!  This episode I actually went into nerd-mode and watched in sync with my old Season 5 DVD.  I can say that, unfortunate for absolute purists, that some ""changes"" have been made.  First, the opening warp flyby of the Enterprise is somehwhat different (this is easily seen in that different windows are lit up).  Upon first watching I thought they substituted a CGI Enterprise but now I'm not so sure.  I think it's the physical model of the Enterprise but maybe I'm wrong.  The second ""big"" change was the shot of Picard on the top of the mountain looking down on Ressik. The matte painting is quite a bit different (many of the village buildings, the river, some the grass in the foreground)  It' a very close approximation but there are differences.  To be honest, this is the shot that inspired me to play the DVD and Blu-ray in sync as I never noticed the people walking around in the original episode.  There are people walking around on both the Blu-ray and DVD but the shot of the village is definitely different.  Please don't take this as a bashing of the HD project or outcry for changes being made, it's simply an observation and I imagine it was necessary as they reconstructed the episode.  Perhaps the original matte-painting elements for the village are gone?  On a much more minor note, the framing is a slightly different at times between the SD and HD versions.  Sometimes you'll see more of the ceiling here, or more off to the side of the shot there.  The changes are ever so minor but sometimes are noticeable if watching both versions simultaneously.

On the positive side of things, this episode benefits from more vivid colors and sharper picture.  I found myself noticing all the little decorative touches inside the village, and the better contrast between objects in light and shadow.

So, in closing, to the critics who think this to be a cheap money-grab I say that you couldn't be more wrong.  This revitalization of The Next Generation is a nerdy dream come true for me.  We'll finally be getting a beautiful new HD release of a wonderful show.  Thankfully CBS is doing it right, going back to the film negatives and they are leaving the wonderful old-school special effects in place.  This sampler is just a small glimpse of what is to come.  And I'm betting the Blu-ray sets will prove to be the ultimate collection of TNG episodes.  Hopefully digging through those old film negatives will finally bring us blooper reels and some decent behind-the-scenes documentaries!

2776131,5,B000NOKP12,"Disclaimer:  I originally felt this product deserved 4/5 stars, but owing to the large number of horribly ignorant people rating it low due to the 4:3 aspect ratio (which is a blessing for this release rather than a curse) and/or confusing wide-screen 16:9 with high-definition (which has everything to do with the number of horizontal lines of resolution and next to nothing with the number of vertical lines), I'm rating it 5 stars.

I bought this on release day, read everything on the box and slip-cover, and then watched every episode and special feature on the disc.  As promised, there are 13 seconds of (pretty noticeable) up-converted video footage since the corresponding piece of film seems to have been lost:  let's all hope this is the only case of this, as it's quite a noticeable downward jump in quality (yet more proof that the uninformed with their ""this isn't high-def"" rants have nothing to contribute to this discussion).

The picture is awesome, and most assuredly high-def, maintaining the proper 4:3 ratio it was shot in and always intended to be displayed in:  to have made it fit into a 16:9 ratio would have required cutting the tops and bottoms of the picture off and displaying areas of the film not intended to have been shown on the sides (complete, no doubt, with the occasional shots of mics, stage-hands, etc).  I only ever noticed banding in a dark area on one shot, but it wasn't distracting.  Film grain is evident, meaning any noise-reduction that might have been done was kept to a minimum (if any).

The sound quality (and editing) didn't quite match the video:  lackluster in areas, and some bad cuts between scenes distract from the overall presentation, hence my original 4-star decision.

I bought this because I couldn't wait on the season releases to see what this would look like, and I want to make sure that the studio is fully aware that we are interested in buying TNG on BD.",1328054400,6,1926,4.771084337349397

After I got it and watched 1 episode with my wife I was disappointed.  I think they did a great job reediting the episode, but it will not be worth it to me to purchase any more of the disks they are releasing.

First, the 4:3 ratio is very upsetting.  The reviews online made it sound like it was being released widescreen.  Not widescreen with bars to make it actually 4:3.  Saying it's High Def with this happening is misleading.

Second, I agree with another reviewer.  The sound editing was not very good.  It sounded hollow, like it was in a tunnel.  They should have taken the extra time to improve the sound quality as much as they did the image.

I liked the selection of episodes, and was very happy to see their work on them, but I will not be buying the season disks they release.",1328054400,5,970,4.298342541436464
2776133,4,B000NOKP12,"I probably wouldn't go for the full seasons, so I appreciated them putting out a cheap sampler so I could watch ""Encounter at Farpoint"" again in HD without breaking the bank.

The Blu-ray release features a high definition image presented in its original 4:3 format.  To present in widescreen would mean cropping the top and bottom of the image, which would probably have been fine,  but unless they SHOT the original show in 16:9 and could have shown things not seen before on television, this was the right thing to do.  The darker scenes tend to feel a little too dark, and the image overall feels maybe a little TOO cleaned up, but given the era this was originally produced in, this is a good balance.  I don't think they could have possibly done a better presentation.

The effects, originally created in standard definition and overlayed, have been reproduced in HD and look fantastic.  This is a costly release for Paramount for that very reason.  Kudos to them for making the effort.

The soundtrack has been re-mixed into a 7.1 lossless presentation.  Dialogue is clear and LFE is solid.  The musical accompaniment, however, sounds a bit...off...perhaps a bit tinny?

2776134,5,B000NOKP12,"You don't -- until you see it in HD.  As a total Trek nerd, I followed TNG on TV from its beginning in 1987, even painstakingly recording on video tape each episode (and editing out commercials) which I kept (and watched ad nauseum) until I picked up all the season box sets on Standard Def DVD -- believing at the time that the DVD versions were the best the episodes would ever look and sound.  The sample episodes on this BD demo disc (the pilot ""Encounter at Farpoint"", Worf family honor episode ""Sins of the Father"" and fan favorite ""The Inner Light"") blow their SD versions out of the water in every way.  Paramount should be commended for painstakingly rescanning the original film and recompositing the visual effects in HD to produce absolutely stunning new 1080p versions of these episodes (and, as Paramount has announced, eventually the entire series!).  Filmic detail and color accuracy are greatly enhanced.  And the recomposited visual effects are a joy to behold, especially with respect to transporter effects and character interaction with artificial backgrounds (e.g., against viewscreens and in the holodeck, see ""Farpoint"" for good examples).  The BD's lossless DTS-HD Master Audio track is also a wonderful enhancement, allowing the viewer more clearly to hear ambient audio that sounded muddled in the lossy Dolby Digital track of the DVD versions.  I can't wait for the series to be released on blu-ray in its entirety over the next few years -- each season will be a day one purchase for me.  Every true TNG fan should rush to order this demo disc and see what they've been missing!",1328054400,6,1607,4.882352941176471
2776135,5,B000NOKP12,"I'll add a simple review to all of the other ebullient ones.

This disc CLEARLY shows how great the divide is between Blu-ray and DVD clarity.  I've never, ever seen Star Trek: The Next Generation look this good!  I've compared the experience of watching the original ST:TNG on DVD and TV to looking at the world through cheesecloth or a greasy window.  (While my memory isn't the best, I recall that even when I was watching the original broadcasts the picture quality was soft and detail was poor.)

Not anymore.

What CBS has done with their restoration is nothing short of miraculous.  The stars are sharp and well-defined.  The skin tones are much more accurate.  You can see wrinkles, skin textures, and hair in eye-filling detail.  The Enterprise is sharp, and you're able to pick out details on its surface that you never could before.  In fact, I am even more amazed at how much better the effects look, since in prior versions they were even more blurry and muted than the live performances were.

I won't speak to the sound, since I'm not really an audiophile.

As for the 4:3, it doesn't bother me in the least.  We're all spoiled by widescreen TV's in this day and age, but 4:3 (square) was the way TV shows were presented at the time.  The scenes were staged with this in mind, so simply capturing more of the negative would no doubt lead to other issues and, assuming they did the same for the effects, would require entirely new effects to be produced.  Accept ST:TNG for what it is, in all its 4:3 glory.

In short, if you're a Trek fan you owe it to yourself to see this disc.  It's a terrific appetizer for the discs to come.

P.S.  CBS, if you're listening, you'd BETTER do the same for Deep Space Nine!! (*shakes fist*) To many of us, that series is THE definitive Star Trek TV show and it would be a shame if it missed out on this incredible HD upgrade effort.",1328054400,6,1882,4.447368421052632
2776156,5,B000NOKP12,"Anyone hoping for The Original Series-level re-imaging will be disappointed - this isn't that kind of restoration. TOS BDs are nothing short of amazing, which unfairly set a high bar for anything that might come from The Next Generation; This series did not suffer from the complete deterioration that the original had. What is apparent in this three episode sampler is that the goal appeared to be to make it look great for big, high-definition tvs - and it succeeds 100%. Don't look for a brand-new tentacley-giant-jellyfish monster in 'Encounter at Farpoint' - the horrible cliche ""see it as you have never seen it before"" is more to the point, and to that end it delivers as promised.",1328054400,3,688,4.838983050847458

There is just so much detail, all the costumes have so much detail, there was so much more put into TNG than you ever realized, because watching it on regular TV was just plain bad.

I think the $15 price tag for a Blu-ray speaks for itself. Spend your money how and where you want. I won't be spending any more of mine on any more of these, you'll probably find it on sale someplace for $5 in a few months and still be disapointed you bought it. The Star Trek content and story have not changed, still great. But there are no breakthrough improvments here that warrent spending money on it but buy it and see for yourself!

2776159,4,B000NOKP12,"Ever since the TOS Blu-Ray sets were released, I had been wondering if it were even possible to give the same treatment to TNG and later series. As you may know, these series were shot on film, but all the editing and compositing of effects was done in video, thus relegating us to a somewhat blurry 480i image which, though fine for the televisions of their day, kind of looked like crap on a modern HDTV. Well, wonder of wonders, all or almost all of the original 35mm film still exists in the Paramount archives, and someone with a good head on their shoulders decided that, heck, we can probably make a lot of money by taking that film, scanning it with the best technology available, and re-combining those elements into a television show. And all I can say is, boy howdy, did it ever work!

The TOS sets look superb. This TNG taste test looks even better, because it doesn't suffer from the same limitations as TOS. Those film prints were post-production finished prints, meaning that any optical effects shot would suffer from having been printed several times to combine elements from multiple film sources (e.g. phasers, transporter beams, etc.). Well, the TNG set will cut out that middle-man and go straight to the original film elements for both live action and effects, meaning that no degradation due to compositing is present. The results, especially in space sequences and transporter effects, are astonishing.

But better still is the effect that the new transfer has on faces, cloth and hair textures, fine detail like facial pores and wrinkles, and so on. This film is in better condition than the TOS film, for the simple fact of having aged 25 fewer years. You can see every five o'clock shadow, infinitesimal beads of sweat on a character's brow or lip, and all the make-up you can shake a stick at. Shots of Data are particularly revealing, since we can easily make out now whether his ""yellow"" lipstick has been smeared.

Another area that this transfer makes brand new, like watching a new show, is the detail in dark areas. Where the DVD had presented dark scenes as a mushy mess, the Blu-Ray allows us to see very subtle gradations of light and shadow, and all the detail in those shadows that was previously obscured.

So, suffice it to say, the video quality is unbelievably spectacular. The audio has also received a nice upgrade, with a 7.1 channel DTS mix that creates a very nice set of surround effects, but keeps everything crisp and discernible.

Overall, this is an absolute triumph. This looks better than most HD shows on the air right now, since most of them are shot digitally, which just doesn't look as good as film yet. IF you have any qualms about whether this is an upgrade over the DVD, I can only tell you and repeat with as much fervency as I can, oh, YES, it is an upgrade! It is like watching a brand new show. The clarity of the images is mesmerizing, approaching three-dimensionality at times.

The Okudas have a very public role in this, and they have stated unequivocally that they are bent on respecting the original vision of the series. That means that there will be no faux-widescreen, no digital alteration of effects (with one exception on this disc, a change that fixed a production mistake), only the original elements presented at as high a quality level as is possible. Having watched this Blu-Ray teaser, I can only say that they have delivered on every iota of that promise.

Now that I'm done gushing, I must say that this particular preview disc does *not* present a superb value for the dollar. For its price here on Amazon, you only get 3 episodes, basically no extras (two small trailers), and that's it. This pricing puts it at about 3 or 4 times the cost per episode of the average television Blu-Ray. Had they seen fit to include a longer restoration documentary, or even a documentary pulled from television, I'd feel a lot better about keeping this disc in my collection. As it is, I'm going to sell it, and buy the season sets instead.

Long story short, I will not hesitate to re-buy the entire series in Blu-Ray after having seen this. And I'm pretty cheap. It's that good. This looks better than most of the Trek movies on Blu-Ray (certainly 3-6, as well as Generations and First Contact), if that gives you any idea what to expect.

2776160,5,B000NOKP12,"for about 15 bucks (current sale price) it is definately worth it to see an old favorite brought back to current technological standards of today. Back in the day, TNG already looked very dated and sloppy, but what makes this blu ray worth the money is the amount of clean up in the footage and the audio track. Its not about just making it ""sharp"" and up to 1080p standards on an HDTV, but watching these episodes and feeling as if it is all brand new again. The colors and the crisp audio to accompany it, making something that is 25 years old young again. I only hope that when these sets are released season by season that they are reasonable in their pricing, because I would love to invest on a restored classic. I would assume that as the seasons of TNG went on, the amount of detail would improve. Meaning, that even though the encounter at farpoint (shot in 1988) is about as cleaned up and restored as could be, there is only so much you can do to old footage. But then you look to sins of the father, which is shot in the 90's, you can tell that the technology in the 90's helps make the restoration somewhat easier and more noticeable. Making episodes in later seasons BETTER AND BETTER.

If you own the old DVD sets, then pick up this blu ray and see what is happening to a beloved classic. The differences are almost night and day between the two formats. I hope DS9 and Voyager get the same treatment someday!",1327968000,6,1424,4.333333333333333

The score, dialog, and sound effects have such richness and depth now. Further, the video quality is now outstandingly vibrant and approaching movie quality. And the ship shots... The ship shots and special effects have been reworked to a jaw-dropping degree. We have definitely been convinced to save up for the full seasons when they become available on Blu-ray.",1327968000,5,598,5.05050505050505
2776162,4,B000NOKP12,"First off, simple warning. The clarity is amazing, but DO NOT expect this to look as amazing as the Blu-ray films, most notably First Contact. Perhaps this is what I was hoping for, but this should not be expected because the filming processes are very different. (as well as the budgets obviously)

OVERALL
-- Worth the low price.
-- Best quality of the show, no questions asked.
-- Not the best episode selection to show off the clarity.
(Q Who, Remember Me, Yesterdays Enterprise, Cause and Effect, or Disaster could have been nice single-part episodes to have included that are both adrenaline based episodes, as well as special-effects heavy)
-- Some details, such as the starry sky background of windows looks cheap now unfortunately, while other textures like the Enterprise exterior itself look beyond words, or even the stunning opening sequences now.
-- Blacks could be darker, (only for Encounter at Farpoint) but over all, this is adjustable with individual TVs.

Rating 4/5.  Almost perfect. More special features perhaps. As well, the film grain is somewhat noticable, which sets it apart from new blu-rays, BUT, there is something almost nice about this.",1327968000,2,1169,5.078125
2776163,5,B000NOKP12,"Let me start by saying Star Trek: The Next Generation has never looked this good!  Having seen TNG from the first airing, syndication, and on DVD, I'll say without reservation this is by far the best quality release.

As soon as I started watching Encounter at Farpoint, I couldn't help but stare at the detail.  The extra detail is amazing, especially in the effects shots.  It's hard to believe that so much was washed out in the lower resolution original.  But the new transfer of the film really shines.

The uniforms pop, you can see the detail in the fabric.  The Klingon costumes in Sins of the Father really show this.  The space aliens in Farpoint look amazing.  Until seeing this on Blu-Ray I knew they were both the same color - but they're not!  The rebalanced color looks great.  It's no longer washed out and it really brings out the details.

The only possible negative I would point out is that you can see some of the imperfections in the makeup.  Worf's especially, including some stray hair in one scene. Everyone else  has lost their smoothed out unblemished skin, now replaced with a more natural texture.  At one point I swear you can see a red mark on Riker's forehead.

One of the most notable things that's fixed is the blue glow on the left side of the screen.  They finally removed it!

None of the over smoothing from DNR that happened in the movie releases is present here.  The picture quality is truly top notch.  If they do the rest of the series this way, this will be by far the definitive version.

I'm also ecstatic that they didn't redo the visual effects in CGI.  I still think actual filmed models look more realistic if done well.  There's just something that CGI doesn't quite replicate.  For the original series I was hoping they would reshoot the effects scenes with new models, but they took the CGI route and it stands out.  Not here!  Because they had the original film elements they were able to rescan and re-composite the effects shots and they look wonderful!

The only real hiccup is 13 seconds of missing footage from Sins of the Father.  They were unable to locate the original film for a scene where Beverly and Riker talk on the bridge.  They had to replaced it with up-converted standard definition video.  They did a good job color balancing it and looks good with the rest of the video.  Paramount gets credit for not only mention this on the box, but on the menu under the episode selection as well.  It's great when a company is upfront about what you're getting.  That said, even though I knew it was in the episode and was looking for it, I missed it on my first viewing.  I had to look online to find where the scene occurred and watch it again it to notice the difference.

All in all this is a great taste of things to come.  As they said the night TNG premiered:
""Tonight, the 24th century begins!""  I can't wait for the rest of the seasons to be released on Blu-Ray!  Excellent job!",1327968000,153,2949,4.473684210526316
2776164,5,B000NOKP12,"It's like watching it for the first time! The detail is great, the sound is great and overall a good buy. The only thing that bothers me a little is the amount of film grain, but I think that's a sign of a good conversion and is offset by the high detail.",1327968000,2,255,3.923076923076923
2776165,5,B000NOKP12,"I have reviewed this disc on a 140 inch 16:9 projection screen using a Panasonic PTAE-7000U 1080p projector.  For contrast, I also watched this disc on my 60 inch 1080p HDTV.  Watching an image at 140 inches reveals every detail, both the good and, sometimes, the not-so-good.  A lot of this detail wasn't very obvious on the TV set but was quite apparent on the projector.

Video Quality:  TNG has never looked better, and probably never will.  Even on a 140 inch screen the image holds up very well.  I was immediately struck with the textures present on the Enterprise D, in particular, the walls and the carpet!  Color was also rich and exceptional.  At times, if not for the Pan & Scan Aspect Ratio, one might actually mistake these episodes for a Star Trek movie and not a television episode.  In particular, the Enterprise-D model looks amazing and is movie-theater quality.  The only thing that I did notice about the overall image quality was that sometimes I found the film grain to be a little distracting.  However, my guess is that this was chosen over applying a stronger noise reduction effect to the remastering process.  I think that they made the right choice on this, as I can use my blu-ray player and/or my projector to reduce the film grain if I want to.  If they would have softened the image, thereby also removing the detail, you can't do anything to bring that back into the image even if you wanted to.  The way it was done, the viewer is given the option of tweaking the image at home to better suit their own taste, or to simply leave the image alone, as well.  I greatly appreciate this consideration and thank the project developers for this asthetic choice.

Speaking of the image, one of the things that I actually found quite amusing is that there are a lot of things that I'm sure were never considered an issue when the series was made.  Here are a few examples.

In ""Encounter at Fairpoint"" there are scenes where stunt doubles are being used that look absolutly nothing like the cast member (i.e. Data rescues Wesley from the holodeck pond (both Data and Wesley's doubles) and when Yar attacks a soldier in the Q courtroom sceen).  Check these out on a large screen and you can't help but laugh!  This was also an issue on the TOS episodes on blu-ray.  Additionally, some models and matte paintings now are fairly obvious to pick out (i.e. the Old Bandi city that is being attacked by the alien looks pretty weak, and in the alien ship / fairpoint station interiors you can now see the seam and the contrast between the actual set and the matte paintings behind them intended to extend the coridor).

Another example of a pre-HD era production issue can be found in the ""Inner Light"" episode.  The old-age makeup applied to Picard, and to his wife, looks way overdone, to the point of being almost cartoonish in appearance.  However, this was probably done at the time in order to attempt to emphasize his aging and to really make this stand out for the 1980's-1990's era homeviewer watching this on the, then-standard, 20-30 inch TV set.

Lastly, ""Sins of the Father"" has some footage missing that they had to spice SD negatives into in order to complete the episode.  The disc actually tells you where this is at in the episode, which was thoughful but not needed because the contrast between the two images is striking and obvious on a large screen; but not as much so on a smaller one.  If nothing else, wathing these upconverted SD images will really help the viewer to appreciate the work that is going into these episodes.  They could have easily been upconverted instead of painstakingly being rebuilt from the original negatives.  The decision was made to do it the right way, and it was clearly the right choice in order to do TNG justice on a large screen and in an HD viewing era.

Audio:  I won't say much about this, except that it is first rate.  Both the new DTS Master Audio Stereo and Multichannel tracks.  I had no idea how much detail was present in both the sound effects and, suprisingly, in the score.  As with the video quaility, the audio is vastly superior to the previous TNG DVD release.

Extras:  They are very sparse, and the only real letdown on this release.  You get the TNG remastered project teaser promo (which fans have already seen), a brief Season 1 blu-ray promo with little new footage shown, and an advertisement for an I-pad app.  That's it!  I would have liked to have seen even a 5-10 minute documentary on the creation of this disc, progress on the TNG project, anything...just to further fuel excitement for later releases and encourage customers to buy the upcoming boxed sets...again.  My guess is that they just wanted to get this disc out to the public ASAP and that this was where they had decided to cut some corners for expediency.

Overall:  I am very happy with this release, if for no other reason that to get a sample of future TNG episodes in this format and with this level of video and audio quality; assuming they continue with this project in the same manner.  After watching these episodes, I know that I will be rewatching every TNG episode again when they are released on blu-ray; something that I would have been unlikely to do anytime in the near future if not for the quality of these remastered episodes.  Watching Encounter at Farpoint, last evening, felt like I was seeing this in a theater for the first time.  I could not help but remember how different this experience was for me when I watched it in my living room as an over-the-air broadcast in 1987 on my 20 inch TV set. :)

If you really want to see what can actually be done with TNG, (especially on a large screen), you have always been a TNG fan, and you want to encourage work like this to continue to be done, it is well worth the price of buying this sample disc IMHO.  I hope that this review has been helpful for some of the readers who were skeptics of TNG remastered project and who were on the fence about making this purchase.",1327968000,17,6006,4.543255813953488
2776186,5,B000NOKP12,"Received the blu-ray today, and currently watching Farpoint on my 58"" Plasma HDTV. Excellent color and sound compared to the poor transfer of the DVD's of the past. Deanna and Tasha are even more beautiful in HD! Detail in the picture is excellent and clean, but wouldn't say it's perfect. There are occassional little white dots/specks that flash on the screen in some places. So it looks like they are not doing frame by frame cleanup, but using an automatic approach which misses some spots. Ocassionally can also see a mark on the floor of the Enterprise, showing the actors where to stand. I wish they would've erased these marks from this transfer. Also noticed at the end of the beginning credits, there are some white lines at the top of the frame that show up for a split second. It is so funny actually seeing all of the background characters reactions in the future ""court"" scene in Farpoint. Some of their reactions crack me up when Q rolls in on his throne. Some graininess on darker scenes, especially in the ready room where Picard is talking with Riker. The right side of the screen appears a little washed out, just like the DVD transfers.

DTS surround sounds excellent, and the Star Trek main title theme hasn't sounded better since now! Ship uniform colors now look great with no color cast. Bitrate of the blu-ray is high on each episode, using about 25+Mbps rate. the Enterprise model detail really holds up well to HD. The running lights and glow of the nacelles are awesome looking! Even noticed on the main title sequence that there are two people walking around on the bridge, as the ship goes to warp! In the past, I've only noticed one person. Overall, a great step up in detail and color accuracy from the DVD set. Warp 9! Engage!

Update during watching Farpoint: During the holodeck sequence where Riker meets Data, and they go behind a tree...On the DVD version, there was a noticeable film cut here using two takes that were spliced together. In this Blu-ray, the cut is not noticeable anymore and looks great!",1327968000,7,2043,4.6722222222222225
2776187,4,B000NOKP12,"At it's core it is an amazing HD transfer, CBS digital went through a lot of effort to go back to the 35mm film and re-cut the episodes, the last release i read said that they had 20 regular employees working on a 24 hour a day restoration schedule trying to complete all 7 seasons, releasing 2 each year, and at least 1 in 2012. The quality is staggering. Everything is vivid, no detail hidden. There are however a few issues that seem to be getting a lot of attention in reviews that i hope i can clear up.

First of all, it IS in the original 4x3, a lot of people have complained about this, and while i agree it would be nice to see a non-stretch 16x9 TNG it is never going to happen. Not only is the 4x3 bringing the most authentic release to the series, but the 16x9 format would pose several large issues. The show was shot to be shown in 4x3, as well as the special effects, the transition could not be made with the original SFX stock, and as CBS has gone out of it's way to preserve the original SFX it would defeat the point. The other issue is that since it was shot for 4x3 things like boom mikes, crew, set ends and such would show up in a 16x9 shot, this would take significant CGI work to cover up, again defeating the point of it being ""authentic"".

One big complaint i hear is that the release is quite grainy, and it is. And no matter how much we would like it to be otherwise, it will always be grainy, its straight from the original 35mm footage, which is grainy. Disappointing, yes, but nothing can really be done about it.

The last thing i have to comment on is price, a lot of reviews on here have complained about the cost of buying re-release after re-release, there is no point in complaining about it, if you are fine with the DVD then stay with the DVD, those who want more can buy more. EOS.
I loved what i saw and heard, and cannot wait for season 1 later this year, and am hopeful they proceed onto other ST series.
 In the mean time im sure i will watch this many more times.",1327968000,10,2009,4.130434782608695

2776189,4,B000NOKP12,"I was excited to receive the sampler and played entire disc without delay. Overall it's pretty darn good compared to DVD.

The main menu is using the PADD user interface, which is nice! Besides the three episodes, there are the two TNG HD trailer/promo, and one promo on iPad PADD app. So not much on the disc.

Here are my notes on the three episodes:

Pictures - The Good
----------
* The details of the ship is pretty good in space - when the ship is up close!
* The details of make up and fine hair strands are excellent! So are the colors of eyes, uniform, and ship panels.
* The wrinkles on the faces and exposed skin can be articulated!
* Overall the FarPoint and Sins of the Father are excellent (but not Inner Light)

Pictures - Not the greatest
--------
* It's 4:3.
* The picture is soft, which conforms to the times in the 80s and early 90s. So don't expect modern HD picture style
* There are times with Enterprise far away and coming closer, the ship was really faint and blurry. The contrast of the ship with black space was really soft, and the blue deflector array was faint blue. Then as the ship gets closer, oh about 1/2 screen size, suddenly the screen brightens! This includes the deflector array becomes bright blue, the ship then has sharper contrast with space, and stars are brighter. I see this happening also when showing credits in space at the beginning and end. Some of the actors' names would be faint blue, then others follow would be brightened.
* For Inner Light, the shots on the planet (indoor and out) are very grainy. Not sure because it's bright pictures or what. Just too grainy compared to the other two episodes.

Audio - The Good
------
* Voices come through very clear!
* Music come through clean
* Lots of LFE (low frequency effects). I do feel rumblings a lot.

Audio - Not particularly obvious
------
* Can't feel much effects on my surround side/back speakers. Seem to mostly coming from front 2 and the subwoofer. Some scenes (such as from holodeck) I was hoping water sound and birds can be heard from surround speakers (but couldn't).

I tested the pictures on four screens: Sharp XV-Z170000 3D 1080p projector with 120-inch Da-Lite 1.5 gain, 50"" Samsung LED 1080p, 50"" LG Plasma THX Certified 1080p, and my laptop with 15.6"" 1920 x 1200 Full HD. Smaller screens are sharper of course, but from 50"" u9p I get the same consistent result.

Overall, this is a pretty strong improvement for the TNG TV series. I am impressed by the work put in, as it's much better than any previous home releases of TNG episodes.",1327968000,,2560,4.502155172413793
2776190,5,B000NOKP12,"Just the fact that Paramount/ CBS are willing to bankroll this painstaking conversion, pretty much reverse-engineering each episode from its original film components, is worth the price of admission.  TNG was ""my"" Star Trek as a little kid and to see episodes as you remember them, and not as the VHS-grade shadows of themselves, is extremely gratifying.  The producers of this blu-ray should be proud.

The 35mm original prints appear utterly pristine.  Colors pop, especially the uniforms, and skin tones are pleasingly natural.  Black levels are mostly very good, though many shots are darker than I would like.  Fine grain is variable but usually very subtle.  There is probably a small amount of NR but it doesn't interfere with textures such as hair or fabric.  Makeup effects are surprisingly seamless, a notable feat compared to Star Trek II & III, for example.  I spotted only one shot that appeared a touch out of focus.  I spotted 2 brief shots in ""Sins of the Father"" that appear to be upscaled, but I consider it a credit to the restoration team that they put them out there now rather than trying to hide them in a box set later.  Ultimately those bits only serve as a reminder of the miraculous gift to fans that this project truly is.

I do not have a critical ear for sound but I thought the sound comparable to the TNG DVD sets.  Dialogue is still (gratefully) prioritized.  7.1 seperation seemed minimal/ natural to my ears, although a few model effects shots get more elaborate treatment.

Ultimately the very existence of these shows on blu-ray is a monumental achievement.  If you're a big fan of this series, and you want your voice to be heard in the future, you owe it to yourself to pick up this disc and (more importantly) the seasons to follow.",1327968000,5,1772,4.704545454545454

Making these conversions is expensive, but it's still cheaper than producing a whole new show, and provides a revenue stream for Paramount at a time when they need whatever they can get.

Overall, the image quality is great. It's a bit grainy. Colors are *much* better. The characters look great, Picard in particular. It looks cinematic, as the show was intended.

The reconstructed special effects look absolutely seamless. My hat's off to the effects team.

This Blu Ray includes two standard one hour episodes, and also the two hour series premier. Both episodes are excellent. ""Inner Light"" is considered one of the very best. ""Sins of the Father"" gives us our best view of Klingon culture so far.

I do question the decision to include the premier, ""Encounter at Farpoint"". Obviously I understand why they wanted to release the first episode, but it's a mediocre story with poor lighting, sound, and dialogue. I think most fans would have preferred two good episodes, especially ""Best of Both Worlds"" and ""Yesterday's Enterprise"". But obviously they are saving these for another Blu Ray release.

I highly recommend this Blu Ray, especially for only fifteen bucks.",1327968000,3,1270,5.0

I bought the ST original series on BluRay only because they remastered every episode and even recreated the external scenes and special effects.

But I already own all of the ST series' on DVD, and they look pretty darned good upconverted on a BluRay player. But these were TV series shot with 520p TV sutdio cameras then transfered to 35mm film. I am not going to spend another $300 for the BluRay version of TNG. Then $300 more for DS9, and yet another $300 for Voyager all on BluRay. The DVD versions that I have of these series' is more than good enough. I have already invested over $1,000 for the series' and movies that I now have. I can not see spending another $1,000 just to see a few more details of Riker's beard, Major Kira's rippled nose, or Janeways coffee cup.

Isn't it interesting that BluRay has been around for several years now, and they just now decided to re-release TNG on BluRay? They could have done this years ago. But they wanted to wait to get our money for the standard DVD versions first. Now that sales of the DVD are winding down, they decided it is time to tease us with BluRay versions to milk our wallets for another round. Just wait. In 5 years, they will announce totally digitally remastered versions of these series again with added footage, because they know that people will waste their money a thrid time.

The series ""Enterprise"" was the only Star Trek TV series shot and aired in full 1080i HD and widescreen.  But it was only released on standard DVD, and just long enough to make every dollar they could.  And just recently after several years, they are finally re-releasing ""Enterprise"" on BluRay in HD.  It should have been released on BluRay from the beginning along with the DVD release.  But they wouldn't have made as much money doing it that way.

If they came out with reasonable price tags like $140,(An entire series only costs the movie companies about $15 to copy and package) it might not be so bad. But you know that they will be $300, $400, or more for a couple of years.",1325462400,25,2198,4.5188916876574305

Besides, the choices of episodes are suspect. It would have been better to to ""Encounter at Farpoint"", ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" and ""The Best of Both Worlds"" instead of ""Sins of the Father"" and ""The Inner Light"".

I love ""Inner Light"".  It's probably one of the best episodes in any Star trek series, not just TNG.  But is it really the best episode to show off the TNG Blu-Rays?  It's a totally story-driven episode, and you'd think they'd want to include an episode that can really show off the quality of the high-definition video.

Similarly, ""Sins Of The Father"" is another excellent, story-driven episode.  But special effects are scant, and this episode certainly wouldn't benefit enough from the whole remastering treatment.

In the end, the only episode that really benefits from redone effects is ""Encounter at Farpoint"", the TNG pilot.  The effects in the early TNG years were pretty poor (not terribly bad for their time, but really suffer over time).  I can think of a few areas that could use a re-do, such as Q's space net and the giant alien jellyfish.  Of the three episodes presented here this one is by far the weakest, and if it had appeared in a later season would be largely forgettable.

So just in case there's any doubt as to why I gave only 1 star out of a possible 5:

1.  too many 5-stars have already been handed out - needed to balance things out
2.  blatant and unnecessary money-grab.  Everyone buying this is inevitably going to buy the full seven seasons on Blu-Ray anyways",1323820800,53,1506,4.716475095785441

This is 178 episodes! 1700 or more special VXF. The reviews have been spectacular both in the bluray world and Star Trek world.

As for the actual projects...my god, EaF looks nothing less than spectacular, the picture is crisp, the detail still holds up even though it wasn't planned or shot for such detail. The few new FX and subtle edits improve the episode. There are 3-4 CGI chots or mattes which correct problems. The power beam comes out of the phaser strip now!!

The other two episodes are better stories, genuine classics, but each one successively has more film grain. The one single problem I have with the remastering is they need to up the denoising!!

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION
TO BE AVAILABLE IN HIGH-DEFINITION FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER FOR ITS 25TH ANNIVERSARY

Star Trek: The Next Generation - The Next Level Blu-ray Disc(tm) Will Be Released On January 31, 2012

Complete First Season Blu-ray Available Later in 2012

LOS ANGELES - September 28, 2011 - The beloved series STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION will be transferred to high-definition for the first time ever and released on Blu-ray(tm), it was announced today by Ken Ross, Executive Vice President and General Manager of CBS Home Entertainment.

All 178 episodes from seven seasons will be transferred to true high-definition 1080p for release on Blu-ray and eventual runs on television and digital platforms both domestically and internationally.

""Fans have been clamoring for a high-definition release of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION for years,"" said Ross. ""Transferring the series to high-definition presented difficult technical challenges, but our team has come up with a process to create true 1080p HD masters with true HD visual effects. We can't wait to show fans how pristine the series looks and sounds with our upcoming Blu-ray releases.""

Transferring STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION to high-definition presented numerous challenges - The series was originally shot on film and then transferred to videotape, which was used to edit episodes together. In order to create true HD masters, CBS is going back to the original uncut film negative - all 25,000 plus film reels of it - and cutting the episodes together exactly the way they originally aired. The visual effects were all shot on film and will be painstakingly recompositioned, not upconverted from videotape. The newly cut film will then be transferred to true high-definition with 7.1 DTS Master Audio. Denise and Mike Okuda are consulting on the project.

While the first full season won't be available until later in 2012, CBS Home Entertainment is releasing STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION - THE NEXT LEVEL, a single Blu-ray disc to give fans a taste of the series in HD, on January 31, 2012. The disc will include the feature-length pilot - ""Encounter at Farpoint"" - as well as two more ""fan favorite"" episodes, ""The Inner Light"" (Season 5) and ""Sins of the Father"" (Season 3). The single disc will be available for a suggested retail price of $21.99.

One of the most popular series in the STAR TREK franchise, STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION celebrates its 25th anniversary in 2012. It premiered in first-run syndication during the week of September 28, 1987 and ran through 1994.

Set in the 24th century on the Starship Enterprise, about 100 years after the original STAR TREK series took place, the series starred Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Jonathan Frakes as Commander William T. Riker, LeVar Burton as Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge, Marina Sirtis as Counselor Deanna Troi, Brent Spiner as Lt. Commander Data, Michael Dorn as Lieutenant Worf, Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher and Wil Wheaton as her son Wesley Crusher.

STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION won numerous accolades, including 18 Emmy awards, and was the first - and only - syndicated television show to be nominated for the Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series for its seventh season. It was also ranked #46 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time list in 2002.

So far, the footage on the video teaser is amazing...this bluray is worth it simply for seeing our heroes and FX and divine clarity. It's about time!!",1321574400,8,5538,4.948275862068965
2776245,4,B000NOKP12,"I've seen the promo that shows comparison shots of the footage (DVD) and after being remastered and fitted.  (Can't post a link, but such sites are easy to find.)

The difference is like night and day, even if the stills and video clips are compressed and streamed.  (the actual blu-ray episodes will look even better, and I'm already floored by what I have seen.)

At $22, each 43-minute episode is $5.50 - meaning the MSRP is probably going to be $120~$150.  Just like the original DVD sets.  (""Encounter at Farpoint"" being a 2-hour timeslot premier, 2x43...)  Retail will probably see each season at $90~$110.

For this sampler set, if you're a diehard fan, you're likely going to wait for the late-2012 releases.

If there is a bonus feature describing the work entailed to remaster every piece of footage and re-editing to match the original editing perfectly, that alone will make this sampler set a ""Must-buy!!""  Sadly, at the time of writing this, I've not found out and the info here doesn't say anything.  I only know ""Encounter at Farpoint"", ""Sins of the Father"", and ""The Inner Light"" are presented.

If anything, if they could re-do the music and get Ron Jones to score the season 5-7 episodes, that would be perfection... After all, the show's revamped style and direction for seasons 5-onward, involving the sounds made by bean-eating frogs, just didn't do the show much of any justice...  I'm not blaming the composers, as that was the style demanded from them.

""The Inner Light"" won a prestigious Hugo award for its heartrending drama while ""Cause and Effect"" gives us the total destruction of the Enterprise -- several times -- before reaching its final conclusion (with a fun cameo from Kelsey Grammer, to boot). ""Tapestry"" is a delightful ""what if"" excursion and ""Relics"" gives us the return of Scotty from the Original Series. It's in this last episode that we see some of the weaknesses that plagued the show during its last few seasons: somewhat moribund pacing, atonal music and mountains of Star Trek's famous technobabble used to form a plot device. Still... Scotty!

Collecting this series is an expensive proposition for someone not extensively invested in it. With that in mind, this single-discer is well worth picking up for casual fans and will round off your ""Best of Star Trek"" experience nicely.",1258761600,38,1445,5.784037558685446
2776276,5,B000NOKP12,"I now own both volumes of The Best of the Next Generation. So far, Paramount is 2 for 2. Both volumes have 4 episodes each and the selections are wonderful. I would prefer to have all of the episodes on DVD but Im not a money machine. These discs make owning some of the best episodes afforadble. They look fantastic (as DVD should) and the sound is crisp and mixed well. I hope volume 3 will soon follow. A must for Next Gen fans. Picard always makes it so.

2776277,4,B000NOKP12,"ST-TNG has always been a cerebral show, filled with all kind of philosophizing about problems that might someday arise, given the right developments in technology. The episode I remember the most is on this set - is the android Data a person or property - what my friend called the Dred Scott episode. They really do cover all the potential issues with intelligence, warmth and humor. Plus there's an episode dealing with potential time-travel issues, and two with Jean-Luc dealing with the Borg - gotta love Patrick Stewart with robotics in his face! If you don't want the whole series, this is a great way to get the best of it for a small price.",1245110400,,648,4.643478260869565

With today's digital technology, there is no reason for a DVD to be sold looking this bad.

Less than a week after the new motion picture hit the big screen, Paramount rushed two single disk ""Best of"" DVD releases to the store shelves with no bonus material, and a mere four episodes per disk. One might accept four episodes chosen out of the 79 episodes from the original series, but, one could reasonably expect more episodes to be included in ""The Best of Star Trek: The Next Generation"" considering the complete series consists of more than twice as many episodes as its predecessor. One might also expect better episodes than the four included.  These four aren't terrible, but all represent writing that rush the all to convenient endings almost as much as the releases were rushed into production.

The four episodes include a two part outing featuring the relentless Borg, a story revolving around the rights of Data to control his ""life"", and a story with time travel at it's center, which has become a tired theme in the Star Trek franchise.

The first offering in the collection is ""The Best of Both Worlds"" (Part 1) which aired on June 18th, 1990 and served as the cliffhanger conclusion to season three of this iconic series.  In this episode, which was written by Michael Piller and directed by Cliff Bole, we find the Federation unprepared for the inevitable encounter with the hostile Borg with whom we became familiar in episode sixteen ""Q Who"" of season two.  In part one of ""Best of Both Worlds"" Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) is captured by the Borg and assimilated.  Riker (Jonathan Frakes), who is dealing with an aggressive up and coming officer who is after his job, and concerns about his career choices, must give the order to blow up the Borg vessel with Picard (Now called Locutus of Borg) aboard.

""The Best of Both Worlds"" (Part 1) is a fine episode that will set the stage for many storylines to come including the war between the Federation and the powerful Borg, the after affects of Picards assimilation, Rikers career choices, and more.  The aspects of the production are good, though there are some disappearing Borg drones between the assimilated Picard and the away team when he is first spotted, that create a distraction.

Season four opens with the second part of ""The Best of Both Worlds"" and finds that Riker did indeed pull the trigger on the Borg cube, but the weapon failed and the Borg, and the assimilated Picard live on.

Unfortunately the writing (Still Cliff Bole) in the second installment is more reflective of the other two episodes in this ""Best of"" release than part one of this story, in that the plot simply gets resolved all too conveniently i.e.: Picard is rescued, de-assimilated, Borg ship destroyed, etc.  The facts related to the respective accomplishments are too convoluted, and the impact of the battle between the Federation and the Borg ship is not truly dealt with in this episode, though the impact will be felt in future Star Trek endeavors.

""The Best of Both Worlds"" is one fine story, but not worthy of taking up half of the ""Best of"" release.

Next up on the ""Best of"" menu is ""Yesterdays Enterprise"" which aired on February 19th, 1990.  Directed by David Carson with numerous writers involved, ""Yesterdays Enterprise"" deals with a rift in the space/time continuum that allows for a previous enterprise ship to come 22 years into the future, changing the timeline and the lives of the current enterprise crew.  The Federation is now at war with the Klingon Empire, some characters are gone, and others have returned.  This paradox creates a very interesting story.  Unfortunately the story is far too reliant on the fact that Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) is the only one who is aware that the timeline has changed, must convince the Picard that the previous Enterprise must return to its own time even though it is doomed, and she is unable to be specific regarding her knowledge.  This aspect of the story is annoying as are references to what current history records reveal about the history of the visiting ship.

""Yesterdays Enterprise"" is the most enjoyable episode in this release, despite the previously mentioned flaws, simply because it has more depth of story than the others.

The final episode on the disk was written by Melinda M. Snodgrass and directed by Robert Scheerer, and aired on February 13th, 1989.  In ""The Measure of a Man"" Datas rights as a sentient individual are put on trial with Picard defending Data, and Riker reluctantly leading the opposition.

This episode has some of the best dialog in the release, but simply does not go deep enough and is resolved too easily.  The story fails to adequately play out the concept.

Recommendation:  There is enough Star Trek The Next Generation fun here for the price, but no bonus material, providing only four episodes, two of which are one story, and ignoring seasons five through seven is inexcusable.  Good, but should have been much better.",1244851200,38,4942,4.838479809976247
