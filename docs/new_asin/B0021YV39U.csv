The underwater scenes are so beautiful and tranquil and the narrator's voice was calm, easy to listen to and understand as the various elements invovled in scuba diving were described.

3841563,5,B0021YV39U,"This video is very thorough in what you need to know in order to snorkel or scuba dive.  It mainly focuses on scuba diving and covers everything from how to select the right equipment to what you need to know in order to use the equipment properly.  It covers every essential point to pass the scuba diving certification test, including the necessary environmental observations and how to trim the gear.  The only thing that is not covered is the dive tables, because this varies most in the kinds of certification tests that are given and need to be specific to those tests.  The video is a densely packed information presentation of 45 minutes with lots of video images and underwater scenes.  The narration and images makes the experience of watching the video very pleasant.  Even though it is a fun video to watch, it is very densely packed with all the information that you need.  Because it is densely packed, a person who is studying for scuba certification can benefit from viewing this video many times.  The author of the video, Michael Mish, has made many videos and is an excellent videographer.  Some of his work is presented on video streaming sites and can be found through a web search.  He is a devoted certified scuba diver who has taught others and is therefore qualified to know what is needed to pass the certification test.  He enjoys the floating/flying feeling of scuba diving and tries to convey something of this feeling in his videos.  The quality of his videos is consistent and professional without losing sight of the need to have fun while watching them.",1253750400,4,1586,4.7272727272727275

8349565,5,B0021YV39U,"This is a great review for the beginner, soon-to-be beginner or novice who just hasn't been in awhile. If you've had any kind of certification, you won't hear anything new here, but it's a great overview, cliff-notes version to bring some of it back to the forefront of your brain. I haven't been in almost a year and half and will be going on a dive trip soon to up my certification level and feel more confident that I'm completely prepared. If you're considering going and feel apprehensive about not knowing what to expect from your first dive classes, this would give you a bit of an edge of preparedness of knowing what skills you will need to demonstrate in a pool and in open water. It's also a great overview of the science of water/gasses you need to know to dive for certifications. Well broken down to be easy to understand, without getting cheesy and over-simplified.",1348963200,,880,4.611464968152866
8349566,5,B0021YV39U,"Awesome, clear video with great narration! It takes the ""hard"" out of learning those pesky laws of physics. This blitzes the other boring scuba DVD's. I've been diving for years and after a break of a few years I used this DVD as a refresher. So refreshing! Elspeth, Fremantle, Western Australia",1296259200,,295,4.803921568627451
8349567,5,B0021YV39U,"I found this Scuba training video to be very well produced and easy to follow. Scuba can be a lot of fun, however if you don't know the important details essential for safe diving, you can get into some very dangerous situations. This video explains the nuts and bolts of diving safety in a fun way. If you are getting started in scuba or if your scuba skills are a bit rusty, do yourself a favor and check this out. It could save your life.",1296259200,,441,4.2
