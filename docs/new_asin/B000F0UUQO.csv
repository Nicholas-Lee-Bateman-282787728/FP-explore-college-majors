2547442,4,B000F0UUQO,"This series provided a look into the lives of the TXRD stars. The bouts were extremely exciting to watch time after time. I was very disappointed to see the series end and would love to see its' return. Perhaps the show could be re-vamped and include roller derby teams from other states such as Washington. We have several flat-track roller derby teams. Among them: Dockyard Derby Dames, Rat Rity Rollergirls, and Oly Rollers.",1237680000,,427,4.863013698630137
2547443,1,B000F0UUQO,"I'm a fan of roller derby and aspiring roller girl myself, and I had to shut this off after an episode and a half.

The soundtrack is unbearable and poorly done, the main character (the rookie) introduced in the first episode is awkward and clearly scripted - one of the least compelling people I have seen in the roller derby scene. This is reality TV and they can't even edit her into entertainment?!

One hopes that the season gets better, and the teams other than the PDFs seemed much more fun and less relentless catty. But I couldn't even be bothered to try.

A total waste of money, and I can't believe anyone voluntarily watched it.

Amusingly, if you have read the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rollergirl-Totally-True-Tales-from-the-Track/dp/B000WPMVKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track</a>, this is the banked track league formed by the hated SheEOs. Some of the same characters crop up, and you can see the personality conflicts waiting to happen - particularly with the overbearing PDFs.

I must say, banked track roller derby looks like a lot of fun, and it is certainly more showmanship than athleticism. These girls seemed to be in it for the brawling more than the skating, which is fine, just different from the way the sport is played in Baltimore and DC.",1213833600,10,1363,5.2626728110599075
2547444,4,B000F0UUQO,"I was hooked. This set makes for a nice marathon to watch on some stormy or sickly weekend when there's no reason to go out. Personally, one reason I really dug it was that Lux resembles an old girlfriend that got away. Much of this series seems to take place from her point of view as there is always one camera on her. Even as a spectator in matches where she isn't skating, no incident goes by without a shot of her reaction. At times, this gets to be too much. And who in that league really cares about who wins Best Couple? Is this for the yearbook? There is also so much of Lunatic that I have to wonder why she isn't shown in the credits as more of a key character. It seems that the players who are the most negative or least well-adjusted didn't get marquee treatment despite a lot of screen time. Ex: Hades Lady who is unpopular because of her strict enforcement of rules. Also, watch for the jammer from the visiting Arizona team that looks like a sturdy version of Ellen Paige (Juno).

My favorite moments from the series had to be the night that the Thunderdome was packed and there was a big rainstorm outside the open hanger doors. I also dug the introduction of the old timer known as Ann Calvello. She was a very fun personality that looked ready to strap 'em on one more time. The announcers seemed have trouble creating variations of the old cliche: ""like a hot knife through butter"". Again, I'm going to notice editing issues astutely as I watched all the episodes in less than 4 days. I was also surprised at the number of middle fingers flinging around. Especially from Sister Mary Jane who is a teacher. The bouts here in Cleveland are edgy but half the audience is families. I've not seen a bird yet.

There's also a preview at the end of disc 2 (Punky Needs a Life episode) that clearly shows Lux and Frankie skinny dipping before or after their Orange Art Gallery show preparation. However, the first episode on disc 3 does not contain this scene. I took a day off from work to search for it. Just kidding about the time off.

The level of violence seemed to increase as the series wore on. It's also apparent that to date a roller girl is to date 2 women, not one. Each of them has an alter-ego who may linger for days after a big win. Flexible and supportive men should only apply :)",1206230400,5,2311,4.3325635103926095
2547445,5,B000F0UUQO,"I greatly enjoyed the Rollergirls Series, all of these girls are amazing atheletes and the A&E glimpse into the everyday life of being part of a top Roller Derby Team is outstanding.  The situations and friendships of each player takes the viewer in and makes you feel like you are part of it even if you've never watched Roller Derby before.  If you like live in your face action, drama that takes you in, and some of the most amazing women on wheels then Rollergirls is a must have!",1185753600,,484,4.426966292134831
2547446,5,B000F0UUQO,Ok so the rest of the world got a little taste of what Austin does best.  Austinites got to see the whole thing unfold which is really awesome getting some background on the bouts that we saw and some recap on the ones that we may have missed.  For those of you who want more of TXRD action you should check out the website at TXRD.com.  You can also order DVD's of the most recent season at [...]  Maybe you can get some sort of an update on whats up in ATX.,1152403200,5,459,3.9565217391304346
2547447,5,B000F0UUQO,"This series is a lot of fun. Some of the drama may have been contrived, but you can still tell when the girls get mad, or for that matter, drunk. And there's a heck of a lot more personality to these characters than on any other show.

The bouts might even be more intense on film than they are in person, which is saying something.

Spike TV or some other network needs to pick this show up and make new episodes.",1150070400,14,414,4.098765432098766

8116111,5,B000F0UUQO,"I loved the series on A&E and had to order the DVD set. I have watched it more times than I can count.....I can't really say why I was so drawn to it and still am, but it is loads of fun. I wish I knew where all the girls from this series are now....11 years later; none of them are listed as current skaters on their website. I wish them the best, wherever they are!!! Thanks for the memories and action!!",1492992000,,406,3.9634146341463414

This is also a gift and that is what the person I got it for was wanting.  A great disappointment for
them as well.  I'm sorry but I have to b honest.",1418515200,,245,3.6923076923076925

8116117,4,B000F0UUQO,"I must admit, I really enjoyed this. At first, it was a bit cheesy, but it quickly became addictive. I wish there was more than one season. I would have liked to have seen more skating and what goes on in training (there is bout footage, but it is edited so you only get to see snippets), but overall found it very enjoyable.",1330473600,,325,4.174603174603175

8116119,3,B000F0UUQO,Not too bad. A little Scripted. Frankly I am in Afghanistan and a show with a bunch of women in not a lot of clothing caught my eye!  It is more than that so I give it 2 and 1/2 stars.,1264809600,,184,3.4878048780487805
