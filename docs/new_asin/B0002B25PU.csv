2074353,3,B0002B25PU,"As in all things, you get what you pay for. And here, you get 6 movies, of which only 2 are really watchable and the others are relics of the early days on movies, unwatchable except for an aficionado. They have all fallen into the public domain and the quality of the prints shows this - to call them ""poor"" quality would be generous.

My first issue is with the advertising - ""Digitally Remastered""? No way, just old TV quality copies from old tapes, in most cases ""interlaced"" video with pretty poor resolution and and no sharpness. Is the audio ""enhanced""? No way, it crackles just like an old, worn movie print. I do video/audio processing and I know that, with a little work (or better prints), these movies could have been cleaned up. But for $7, why bother? These guys are selling on price, not quality, and it shows.

The only decent movies in the bunch are ""Rage at Dawn"" and ""Abilene Town"". The prints are barely watchable (not great), so you are really paying $3.50 for 2 movies. Its a shame that these guys don't just located a decent print of these pictures instead of using these old TV tapes. Or spend an evening on an Avid and clean them up a bit, do a little noise reduction to get the ""hiss"" out of the audio!

Like I said up front, you get what you pay for.",1456012800,,1277,4.334728033472803

2074370,4,B0002B25PU,"Over the past decade Randolph Scott has undergone a long-overdue re-evaluation of his place in the history of the Hollywood Western, and many movie historians now look at such films  as  ""Seven Men from Now,"" ""Ride Lonesome,"" ""Comamche Station,"" and especially ""The Tall T."" as some of the greatest B Westerns ever turned out during the studio era. Scott's heroic image of courtliness accompanied by a physical toughness, idealism, and unflinching penchant for justice makes him unique among traditional Western heroes. In the past few years two of the best-selling Western DVD sets feature Scott: four of his key films for Columbia and the box set featuring six of the seven Budd Boetticher Westerns Scott did relatively late in his career.

The RANDOLPH SCOTT WESTERN COLLECTION contains six familiar Westerns from three different eras of the actor's career. They have all been in Public Domain for some time but have never previously been offered in one set before, which makes this collection particularly convenient. Scott cut his Western teeth in Paramount's 1930's Zane Grey series, and the set features four of the ten entries in the series starring the actor: ""The Fighting Westerner,"" ""Buffalo Stampede,"" ""Wagon Wheels,"" and the nest of the bunch, ""To the Last Man,"" a very strong story of a mountain feud that travels westward. It boasts an extremely strong cast including an exceptional performance by veteran leading lady Esther Ralston as well as fine support from Noah Beery, Jack Larue, and a young Shirley Temple in a featured role.

The other two in the set are drawn from real Western history: ""Abilene Town"" (1946)  (based on the clash between homesteaders  and cattlemen over barbed wire) and ""Rage at Dawn"" )1955) (about the infamous Reno gang). Both show Scott to advantage in the evolution of his screen persona and both feature that wonderful but underappreciated character actor Edgar Buchanen in two of his most colorful roles. Western fans will remember that Buchanen also co-starred in Scott's swan song, ""Ride the High Country.""

In short, to the best of my knowledge, these six PD oaters have never before been offered together, and that makes this set a bargain that will fit nicely on your DVD shelf.",1433548800,,2233,5.051630434782608

The one in color is the only one from a major studio and I would have to say it's a grade c. The others are grade D or worst and they are not from a major studio.

When I stumbled into this CD and saw that ""Buffalo Stampede"" was originally titled ""The Thundering Herd"", I jumped at it. A fair movie that follows the storyline somewhat - but probably a disappointment to Zane Grey. Randolph Scott was perfectly cast. A shame they didn't have the technology we have now.

I put this in quotes because my impression of what is ""digitally remastered"" certainly is not the same as the ones who offer this product for sale on the open market.

THE OLDEST, ""WAGON WHEELS"", SHOWS ITS AGE WITH ELEMENTS OF EARLIER WESTERNS SUCH AS SEVERAL MUSICAL NUMBERS AND A YOUNG BOY WHOSE PERFORMANCE RANGES FROM ENDEARING TO AGGRAVATING AS HE BRINGS SCOTT AND HIS MOTHER TOGETHER. STILL, IT'S A SOLID HOUR OF ENTERTAINMENT AS SCOTT AND HIS TWO PARTNERS GUIDE A WAGON TRAIN OF SETTLERS BENT ON COLONIZING THE OREGON TERRITORY ( NOW THE STARS OF WASHINGTON, OREGON AND IDAHO FOR THE UNITED STATES. IN ""BUFFALO STAMPEDE"" HE IS A BUFFALO HUNTER FIGHTING BOTH A RIVAL GROUP OF HUNTERS WHO ARE NOT ABOVE MURDER AND THEFT TO ACQUIRE THE VALUABLE SKINS, BUT ALSO INDIAN TRIBES SEEKING REVENGE ON THE WHITE MAN FOR THE SENSELESS SLAUGHTER OF THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE OF FOOD AND MATERIALS VITAL TO THEIR SURVIVAL. IN ""RAGE AT DAWN"" SCOTT INFILTRATES AN OUTLAW GANG, ONLY TO FACE DEATH WHEN A MOB WANTS TO HANH THE GANG! THEN ITS OFF TO ""ABILENE TOWN"" WHERE SCOTT AS MARSHALL STRUGGLES TO MAINTAIN PEACE BETWEEN CATTLE MEN AND HOMESTEADERS WITH THEIR CONFLICTING AIMS AND GOALS. SCOTT FALLS IN LOVE WITH THE DAUGHTER OF A VENGEFUL EX-CONVICT HELL BENT ON MURDERING SCOTT'S ENTIRE FAMILY AS THE RESULT OF A LONG STANDING FUED THAT SCOTTS FATHER FLED KENTUCKY TO ESCAPE IN ""TO THE LAST MAN"".

That was an unexpected treat.  It's also interesting to experience plots and acting in some of these old early ""talkies.""

Buffalo Stampede is not a discard as it is good till the end of the movie. This should be a addition to anyone's collection either by each movie or by this great collection pack which is cheaper.",1331337600,,600,4.136752136752137
2074438,5,B0002B25PU,"A western does not have to be complicated and complex.  You don't need ten thousand blazing guns, naked girls and 20 cuss words a minute.  You just need a character that can carry the story on his own merit.  They say John Wayne never played anyone but John Wayne in a movie.  I think Randolph Scott is the same way, he is Randolph Scott, he did not need to prep for a role, he just played the character as himself.  Good movies, clear morals and clean.",1325894400,,453,4.22093023255814

2074441,5,B0002B25PU,"The prints are not pristine, but they are more than servicible: broadcast quality 1970 late show.  The films themselves are mostly pretty good and full of surprises from a modern perspective.  Esther Ralston was a revelation.  How is she not better known?  Bonus:  an unbilled Shirley Temple gets shot at.  Also, Barton MacLaine as a good guy!",1314144000,,343,4.9298245614035086

YOU HAVE PROVIDED NO MOVIE TITLES, NO RUNNING TIME, NOTHING. WE, YOUR CUSTOMERS DESERVE BETTER! THIS IS NOT THE ONLY SUCH CASE ON YOUR SITE. NUMEROUS TIMES I HAVE LOOKED FOR MOVIES TO FIND THIS SAME SITUATION. TO ASK YOUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE A PURCHASE BETWEEN $20 AND $75 IN THIS CASE, IS INSANE.

2074443,1,B0002B25PU,"Maybe I was expecting more when I purchased this set, but to be honest, only 2 of the titles interested me:  RAGE AT DAWN was probably the strongest. Granted, it was fun to watch Ann Sheriden before she made a name for herself at Warner Bros. And Miss Shirley Temple has a bit part in another. But if you can look beyond these ""starlets of tomorrow""---you'll notice that the plots are pretty similar.  How many times can you watch Jack Larue play the part of a stinker?  How many times can you see western lawlessness as the cattlemen take on the homesteaders?  And in one film that has no main title at all...how hilarious is it to see the actor or actress introduced by title card as he or she is first seen on screen?

I honestly wish I could send this set back to AMAZON for full-credit.  Trust me...I've enjoyed Randolph Scott's work in his later films, but in this package, Mr. Scott seems more like an accessory than a star! I'm guessing the source material came from 16 or 35MM prints because many of the cue marks and film lines are very visible.",1295395200,,1055,4.384615384615385
