5540258,4,B00B0C5Q4M,I am relatively new to yoga and find this challenging enough without moving too slowly.  Great abdominal workout section and enough variety.,1392595200,,140,5.363636363636363
5540259,4,B00B0C5Q4M,"NOTE: I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; please see that web site for a more detailed version of my review.

Tara Lee is a London-based yoga instructor who has created the Elements of Yoga DVD series. As she explains in her short introduction to ""Fire Dynamic"" (or Fire Vinyasa, as it's titled on the Main Menu), the purpose here is create heat in the body and to release toxins by incorporating twisting postures.

For all practices on this DVD, Lee teaches via voiceover. Fire is set outdoors at night, with several large flaming tubs placed around the set, casting smoke throughout the video. Lee's main prop is a mat (with the orientation frequently changing from parallel to the viewer to perpendicular due to shifting camera views), although occasionally an inset is shown with modification options, and she also uses a blanket for shoulderstand. Lee sometimes notes the names of the postures in English, sometimes in Sanskrit, sometimes not at all.

The Main Menu of the DVD offers the following options: Introduction--Play Workout--Practice 1 (20 mins)--Practice 2 (20 mins)--Practice 3 (35 mins)--Shavasana (5 mins)--Bonus Features--Music Options. Music Options includes choices for ""Music & Instruction"" and ""Music Only,"" but no option for ""Instruction Only"" (a.k.a. a ""Music Off"" option). The individual practices work as stand-alone sequences, but they can also be combined together for a full routine. I have provided detailed information on each practice below.

PRACTICE 1 (actual time=23 minutes)
This practice focus on breath and core work. Lee starts seated for about seven minutes of breathwork, including ujjayi breathing, Kapalabhati (skull shining breath), and breath retention with bandhas. Core work begins with boat pose variations, including moving one arm and one leg. Coming to all fours, Lee performs cat/cow with lion's breath and then bird-dog, adding an elbow-to-knee touch; she finishes this sequence with kneeling dancer's pose and hip circles. Lee then moves between forearm plank and forearm down dog. She does a twist in an all fours position and then plank with fast knee-ins. After resting in child's pose, she performs several vinyasas: down dog to plank, down dog to knees hovering above the floor, down dog to toe lifts, and then down dog to bent knees. Lee comes to standing and concludes with a twisting standing forward bend and chair pose.

PRACTICE 2 (actual time=20 minutes)
Lee suggests setting an intention (sankalpa) at the start of this practice. She moves through a forward bending sequence with breath retention, then comes through a vinyasa back into down dog and side plank. After a single sun salutation, she moves through another vinyasa to 3-legged dog. She brings in the knee to chest three times and then ends in pigeon pose, adding a twist to either side. Returning to 3-legged down dog, she brings the knee in to the opposite side three times before coming into a straight leg stretch and then repeating the entire series on the other side. Returning to standing, Lee concludes this routine with big toe and gorilla forward bends.

PRACTICE 3 (actual time=34 minutes)
This was the only practice that truly centered around twists as Lee mentioned in her introduction, but the fact that it was so much longer than the other two routines on the DVD felt unbalanced to me. The initial focus is on standing postures, and Lee moves right from a vinyasa into a standing pose flow including warrior 1, warrior 3, half moon, and triangle (repeated on other side). The second series starts with revolved low lunge (optional bind) and continues with pyramid pose, revolved triangle, revolved half moon, and 3-legged plank pose; after repeating on the other side, the sequence concludes with wide-legged standing forward bend. Next, Lee moves into tree pose, adding in a side stretch. This is followed by toe balance and an arm balance, flying crow pose. Moving through a vinyasa to squatting, Lee performs another arm balance, crow, and then several seated postures, including cobbler's pose, wide-legged seated forward bend, half Lord of the fishes pose with a twist to the opposite side, and double pigeon. She then transitions to her stomach for several backbends, including locust, bow, and camel, then (returning to her back) bridge and wheel pose. She windshield wipers the knees and then performs a twist with the foot resting on the knee. Lee cues shoulderstand (she uses a blanket here) for about 1 minute, coming out of this posture into plow, deaf-man's pose, and fish. A short (1.5 minutes) savasana concludes this routine.

Selecting Bonus Features off the Main Menu brings up a submenu which offers the same options on all three Elements of Yoga DVDs. In addition to three short yoga practices, the bonus submenu includes a Q & A with Lee (11 mins) and Credits. The routines are as follows:

Earth--Balances (9 mins)
Air and Water--Breathing (10 mins)
Fire--Core (Advanced) (11 mins)

Unlike the other DVDs in her Elements of Yoga series, ""Fire Dynamic"" is clearly intended for experienced yoga practitioners only. Although Lee provides decent instruction overall (but not mirrored cuing), she does not offer enough information for those newer to yoga. This DVD would be best suited to those looking for a more intense yoga experience while still incorporating breath and stress relief.",1374624000,13,5410,5.103954802259887
5540260,4,B00B0C5Q4M,"Tara Lee has put out three new yoga ""elements"" DVD's:  Earth (foundation), Air/Water (flow) and Fire (dynamic.)  This is the most advanced of the three.  I love the night scenery, Tara practicing yoga while surrounded by crackling bonfires; pretty cool!  The workout, though, jumps right into more strenuous moves, like Breath of Fire (an abdominal exercise.)  This is definitely for more advanced exercisers.",1371168000,9,409,5.428571428571429
5540261,5,B00B0C5Q4M,"I own quite a few yoga DVD's as I mostly exercise at home. And I find myself turning to Tara Lee's amazing videos more often than any others. I LOVE this practice! The Fire Practice has got to be my favorite of her 3 element based practices. I think that is because of how many twists and hip openers are in this DVD, after I finish I always feel so yummy. The heat building is very balanced out by periods of rest and there is a definite focus on buidling core strength. There are some pretty challenging moves in this practice so if you are just starting out, I'd go with her Earth Practice, but if you are looking to begin challenging yourself this DVD is perfect. I love Tara's voice, it's so soothing and easy to follow.",1475280000,,725,4.260869565217392
5540262,5,B00B0C5Q4M,Amazing workout. She gives great direction and I already see my body changing!,1468022400,,78,5.076923076923077
5540263,4,B00B0C5Q4M,Yes,1467849600,,3,3.0
5540264,5,B00B0C5Q4M,Love Tara Lee's yoga DVD. I have tired other instructors and she's the only one i can tolerate!  Beginners can do this one but there are a few moves that are for more advanced-but its something to shoot for!,1462147200,,207,4.3076923076923075
5540265,5,B00B0C5Q4M,Definitely the most challenging of her videos. The water video has helped my shoulder injuries the most.,1461542400,,104,5.176470588235294
5540266,5,B00B0C5Q4M,"I love Tara, she is a great yoga teacher.  Her voice and pace make this a good video.",1459296000,,85,3.7222222222222223
5540267,4,B00B0C5Q4M,"I work out regularly 5-6 days per week and consider myself to be in decent shape, and I found this one to be a rather challenging core workout, which is more like a pilates workout than a yoga workout, which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  This is not for beginners or those looking for a relaxed yoga routine, but I do find myself to be very relaxed when I'm finished with it.  I mainly use as an addition to another cardio or strength workout.",1438128000,,453,4.078651685393258
5540268,4,B00B0C5Q4M,"I have another Tara Lee video that I really like (air and water), so I bought this one. For me, this one seems far more advanced! It is more vigorous overall and includes a lot of balancing and core work. Just doing the first two practices was a challenge. It starts with a lot of boat pose variations and goes from there. I was familiar with all of the poses, but they are among the more challenging for me--down dog splits, standing splits, balanced warrior three, half moon, and others. I have been doing a level 1-2 yoga class for maybe 6 months, and have had some other experience with different styles of yoga before that, so I'm not a total beginner. However, I really can't even do the third practice and would not know how to modify most of the poses so that I could do it. I will try to work up to it, but might have to progress in my regular yoga studio before being able to do it correctly.",1437782400,2,902,4.219653179190751
5540269,5,B00B0C5Q4M,I am an experienced yogi and still find the routine challenging! But it could easily be altered for a newbie.  I love Tara's way of connecting the movement to the chakras and the spiritual aspects of yoga. This is currently my favorite video.,1437350400,,242,4.627906976744186
5540270,5,B00B0C5Q4M,Best yoga tape ever.  I've only been doing yoga for about 4 years so I consider myself an intermediate.  This is a very challenging tape for me but every time I do it I get better and better.  I do this tape at least once a week and still love it.  There are a few poses I don't see this 57 year old doing but I at least try!  Definitely worth the money if you love yoga!,1437350400,,371,3.7662337662337664
5540271,5,B00B0C5Q4M,"Very challenging yoga practices for me, admittedly, a beginner.  I have her Foundations DVD (love them) and Flow as well (very good) and Dynamic is the most challenging and very obviously a great core workout.",1433894400,,209,4.9714285714285715
5540272,3,B00B0C5Q4M,It's not for a self teaching beginner.,1423872000,,38,4.571428571428571
5540273,4,B00B0C5Q4M,"This setting is beautiful and the breathing and ab work is great, but she does some advance level stuff in the 35 min section of this practice.",1423180800,,143,4.333333333333333
5540274,3,B00B0C5Q4M,Simpler surroundings would be preferred.,1419206400,,40,7.2
5540275,5,B00B0C5Q4M,"This is her most challenging set of practices yet - but so great.  I use her dvds daily and have seen drastic improvement in my own flexibility and strength and am experiencing relief from some old nagging back and shoulder injuries.  If you are new to yoga, try her other 2 Elements of Yoga (Foundation: Earth and Flow: Air and Water)dvds first - they are more accessible to beginners but still a great practice for the experienced.",1419206400,5,433,4.6103896103896105
5540276,2,B00B0C5Q4M,"I think if I could return this one, I would. The 10 minute core routine is great, and I enjoy tacking that on to my other at-home yoga classes. But, the full length class is just off. It doesn't flow the way I'm used to, which makes it feel unbalanced. I feel like the instructor has you doing random poses in no particular order. It is also broken into 3 separate sections, which doesn't help with the feeling of not having a flow. The first two sections are around 20 minutes and the last is 35, which is different from what the back cover says. Just as an F.Y.I. I also don't feel good when I'm doing this one. My body doesn't feel good, and my mind doesn't either. Lastly, she often rushes through the second side so much so that I've had to pause the DVD to get the same amount of time on each side. Yoga instruction is a personal thing, so maybe this works for others. I just wanted to share my thoughts and experiences. I do feel like I work hard in this one, so that's a plus.",1412208000,16,984,4.130208333333333
5540277,5,B00B0C5Q4M,"my second her DVD. I'm  advanced level of yoga. she has good challenging poses in this dvd.
Highly recommended. I have been work every day.",1409270400,,139,4.56
5540278,2,B00B0C5Q4M,Not for me.  I have been doing yoga for many years and have many favorite DVDs.  This one is a slow start and too much commentary and Eastern terminology and junk.  I want to use yoga for exercise and relaxation....not a spiritual experience.,1408752000,4,242,4.5813953488372094
5540279,5,B00B0C5Q4M,Very great DVD! Easy to understand and follow. Awesome for the morning routine!,1406764800,,79,5.153846153846154
5540280,5,B00B0C5Q4M,"I wanted a video that I could use for a while, since I have been doing yoga for a few years.  Well, I don't think I will be able to truly complete this video for a while!  It's GREAT and hard.
When she does something I cannot do, I just do child's pose!
If I do the first 20 minutes, and the next 10 of the next segment, my core feels excellent.",1399420800,2,345,3.7777777777777777
8560237,3,B00B0C5Q4M,Not for beginners.,1515110400,,18,5.333333333333333
8560238,5,B00B0C5Q4M,Dont buy this unless you are ready to sweat and push your limits. I have yet to finish in one sitting. Very intense,1508371200,,115,4.043478260869565
8560239,4,B00B0C5Q4M,"Good but very advanced practice,",1504137600,,32,5.6
8560240,5,B00B0C5Q4M,This is definitely challenging! I love Tara Lee and started out with her Air DVD but I got used to it and needed something more challenging and this is exactly what I was looking for! I recommend this for a more advanced yogini.,1496275200,,228,4.325581395348837
8560241,5,B00B0C5Q4M,Very nice,1494720000,,9,4.0
8560242,5,B00B0C5Q4M,Tara's videos are great. Her instructions are easy to follow. This is more advanced that her other two DVD I have. But in her calm manner she just explains to keep trying that it's ok to tip over. I did tip a few times but was glad to have her say it may happen and it's ok. It really is like being in a class with an instructor because she explains things so well.,1492732800,,365,3.945945945945946
8560243,5,B00B0C5Q4M,Great video and workout.,1491264000,,24,5.25
8560244,5,B00B0C5Q4M,"A little bit about me...I am a devoted video exerciser and came to yoga through Ellen Barrett's fusion workouts (wonderful, BTW, but not  traditional yoga). Gradually, I began to expand my home yoga practice and to take classes in a local studio and consider myself an intermediate yogi. I was craving a more challenging sequence and this is a perfect fit. I cannot successfully execute the arm balances in this workout, but it gives me something to work towards. I LOVE this workout!! I especially like to do this dvd in the evening with a couple of lit candles. This is very warming practice for winter or anytime I need to ignite the fire.",1487462400,,642,4.631578947368421
8560245,5,B00B0C5Q4M,"This video is a bit more challenging than the air and water one which is perfect!  Again, i like that there are three segments that you can do separately or together. I would not recommend it for a beginner.",1484092800,,207,4.3076923076923075
8560246,5,B00B0C5Q4M,I love  this video. Definitely challenging but you can use modifications to fit your needs. The night time scenery is awesome.,1478476800,,126,5.0
