8669939,5,B00M31VE54,"I am steering our 10 month old son towards this series since I like it's values and also like that it is not a typical mind-numbing, scene-flashing over-stimulating animated series. The series is about ""trainees"" who learn the value of friendship, telling the truth, listening carefully, persisting under adversity, completing tasks, resolving conflict and similar values. And yes - we limit his TV watching to short periods or when in the car.
From a mechanically-inclined engineering type adult's perspective, I actually get a kick out the great detail that is used in the animation (it's actually more computer-generated than traditionally animated). Things like the details of the switching mechanisms to the rubber-nubbed mats used along the edge of the platforms. Granted these are not required or important but add to it's quality and realism, in my opinion (did I say ""add to its realism"" about a talking train cartoon?). Anyway, this series is only run at limited times, so I purchased a few DVD's. All were very well priced - actually way cheaper than I would've guessed. At this age he mainly is interested in the colors and whimsical nature, but I think it's a wholesome program to grow with.",1441670400,,1204,5.025
