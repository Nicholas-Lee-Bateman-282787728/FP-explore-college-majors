6565467,5,B00MA153QS,"This is a very well made peace of history. It is a very honest play that may challenge you, and that is why it is good. The acting is very much what you will find in true theater. It is not a polished Hollywood production and that help it being an honest thought provoking and yes historical record of an ongoing strugle of LGBTQ, and all people who struggling for peace in this world.",1426377600,,385,4.216216216216216

6565474,5,B00MA153QS,The film and the story are inspirational and very well done!,1413763200,4,60,4.545454545454546
6565475,3,B00MA153QS,"The problem with this documentary movie is that the play at its center is badly written - so bad that hearing just a few lines of it is enough to make me cringe. People have complained that this movie doesn't show the full play, but I'm grateful it doesn't. I assume they included the best parts, so the rest of it must be even worse.

I love Terrence McNally very much as a person, but as a writer he's not that good. His writing is pretentious and clumsy, and it never sounds like real human beings talking. If he weren't gay, weren't a very attractive, compassionate and charismatic man, and didn't therefore have an automatic following in the gay community, I think he'd probably have had to spend his life doing something else.

The bad actors who are putting on the play's 2006 revival in LA don't help any, but the play itself is so leaden and contrived that I don't think ANY actors could bring it to life. What's most disturbing about this movie is not the virulent but oh-so-predictable opposition to it from ""Christians"" - whose loudest spokespeople are always the stupidest - but the fact that so much energy was wasted on such an embarrassingly bad play. (McNally's claim in this movie - that the opposition from fundamentalist Christians came as a total surprise to him - is not credible. NO one could be that naive.)

That's too bad, because the concept - a strong and loving gay Jesus - is fantastic. I just wish a more talented playwright would rise to the challenge and give us a play that's WORTH fighting for.",1413504000,14,1529,4.532608695652174
8671027,5,B00MA153QS,"This is not the film of the play. This is the documentary of a troupe of players from Corpus Chirsti, Texas and their journey of presenting the play over a period of years. I bought the copy of the script and there are some scenes in the documentary that are not in the script..I would highly recommend purchasing it and watching it.",1519948800,,333,4.387096774193548
8671028,1,B00MA153QS,After reading the description ( I guess I should pay closer attention) I was hoping to see the actual play.  Not hear about the journey the cast went through to put on the play.,1506124800,,177,4.205882352941177
8671029,4,B00MA153QS,A moving story. Only negative was lack of captioning.,1483920000,,53,5.0
8671030,3,B00MA153QS,"Insightful, but I wanted to see the whole play.  This is just a biography of the production, not the entire play.  But still very entertaining.",1475366400,,143,4.68
8671031,4,B00MA153QS,"This is a documentary of the play, as the public protest about a gay Jesus, as one of the guys play Jesus, and as each one talks about their own feelings, and background stories of their lives.",1467244800,,193,4.243243243243243

8671033,5,B00MA153QS,"I only wish it had been a copy of the play itself.  But it describes a play that if it ever gets shown in my area, I am going ot see.  What IF Jesus was more than a man?  What if he never needed to Marry because he was Gay, an Eunuch in the old understanding of the term eunuch.  Why did Jesus say Matthew 19:12?  Could he have been explaining himself to the world?  He said ""Some eunuchs are born that way....""",1442188800,,411,3.891566265060241
