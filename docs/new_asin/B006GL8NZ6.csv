4987161,3,B006GL8NZ6,"The movie starts off well with susbtantial tension. However, things go rapidly downhill and it becomes a monotonous exchange between the 2 people - I greaw tired of the repeated escape attempts ! Ok for 1 watch but nothing special.",1340496000,2,231,4.8
4987162,2,B006GL8NZ6,"It was a bored to death night & I had $2 to burn I guess. You may like it, but I didn't even go through the whole thing.",1337731200,,120,3.3214285714285716
4987163,2,B006GL8NZ6,"The movie was fairly decent for the genre, nothing especially great about it but nothing too terrible except for the dreadful quality of the acting. Stunningly bad.
Good storyline and not too bad for popcorn fodder.....just please, hire competent actors whenever whoever decides to make a movie makes a movie....don't hire friends of friends or street people or wherever the people in this movie were found. Ruined what could have easily been a 4 star rated film.",1334361600,14,463,5.025974025974026
4987164,2,B006GL8NZ6,"This movie was super sluggish at times, dark, and definitely not for the faint of heart, or.....other parts of your anatomy. Twisted ending for sure.",1334188800,3,149,5.0
4987165,5,B006GL8NZ6,"The ending of this movie came out of left field and was twisted--which is why I loved it. I am generally not impressed with horror movies but this one I'll gladly see over and over again.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Keepsake/dp/B007FNZNS4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Keepsake</a>",1332892800,7,319,7.205128205128205
4987166,4,B006GL8NZ6,"I little slow at times, but still a great show. Most defiantly something you want to watch from beginning to end, otherwise you may not get the plot. Please do take into consideration ""this is a low budget film"" but still shot to near perfection...and yes the twisted ending could have been I little different; I still could think of other thing's I would have taking such as lose of eyesight would have truly suck, being in the position they were going to be in. But still, her story her ways;)  Good show, try it and be pleasantly surprised:P",1331683200,,544,4.494949494949495
4987167,4,B006GL8NZ6,This is a very dark scary movie that has a lot of depth...  You have to really reach down into your mind and soul to understand this girls horror and how she makes it through a long lonely capture.  There are times that you are not sure if this is really happening.  And I will be sure that I travel  with lots of emergency tools and with plenty of company.  The young people in the movie are very good actors.,1330905600,17,410,4.075

8497680,1,B006GL8NZ6,"What an idiotic ending.  The movie wasn't very good either, but that ending...wow!  Who thought THAT was a good idea?  Hey geniuses who made the movie...your twist at the end should make people think about the movie and maybe reevaluate what they've seen, not look back at the preceeding 90 minutes and see nothing made sense.  The movie was shot pretty well although the camera would shake all over the place even when people were just standing still, which was a dumb affectation.  We get it, you've seen Hollywood action movies and lots of indie thrillers, congrats.  The lead actress was very good.

Everything else...woof!",1394928000,4,627,4.914285714285715
8497681,4,B006GL8NZ6,"Typical guy grabs girl, keeps her prisoner. The collar is some kind of shocking device. If you're looking for T&A, yes, she gets naked. It seems like it's not going anywhere; i.e. girl kept in cellar...and then? Well, no spoiler, but it gets interesting toward the end. The actual climax is a bit far fetched. Let's just say she's not the first.",1394236800,4,345,4.580645161290323
8497682,2,B006GL8NZ6,"not a bad movie, unfortunately it shifts between dream sequences referring to past events which are a little too vague to help you understand whats really going on, whether this is the filmmakers intent or not, it has too many issues going on to be of value. The twist hinted at comes at the end, but you see it coming, and by then I was a little, not confused, just tired from having to keep track of everything. Watching the movie seemed like a lot of work. the acting was above average on all sides, the special effects( torture scenes) were a little amateurish, and in the end I was just glad the movie was over, still wondering why certain elements of the movei were introduced and never explored. Was the guy a sick SOB, of course, we infer that rather quickly, we didn't need more examples of his work unless there's another reason for it. Some people might like it more, but I was thinking it would be a straight horror movie. what I saw was a movie trying to be cover the torture/horror/revenge angle, but it split in too many directions to sufficiently cover one of them.",1393027200,4,1081,4.437185929648241
8497683,3,B006GL8NZ6,"Janine's vehicle runs off the road. The tow truck driver is a mute who then takes Janine captive. While captive we find out a few things that keep us interested in the film. Janine admits to being a thief and has a stolen photo album in her SUV which she claims is worth money. People are after it. In order to cope with captivity and the zap collar, she escapes into a dream world with her sister Alice where we discover she has daddy issues. What's in the photo album? What's with the dreams and daddy?

The mystery aspect holds our interest because the slow moving film does not. The mystery involves a twist ending, which didn't make the film much better. A borderline pyschological thriller.

F-bomb, nudity (Sunny La Rose, Courtney Hogan)",1358812800,13,744,4.586466165413534
8497684,2,B006GL8NZ6,"Although a twisted surprise ending concludes this movie, KEEPSAKE is another torture exploitation film focusing on the degradation of women, passing itself off as entertainment.  Writer/director Paul Moore allows our ""heroine"" Janine to consistently do stupid things and fills the script with numerous faux escapes in a sloppy attempt to create suspense.  There are more plotholes than Swiss cheese but to avoid spoilers, I won't go into them here.  KEEPSAKE also suffers from slow pacing and bad acting.  If you stay awake, the finale is effective, but it by no means redeems the movie.",1344816000,4,587,5.212765957446808
