1396535,1,B000056BPE,"I was Buffaloed by this VHS turned to DVD . These guys are hilarious. The bass player never faces the audience the entire set. They have extra guitars in the background that they never use. I thought I was watching the Marx brothers perform Springfield material. It is amazing that this is being presented in any way, shape or form. If you listen to it through headphones without watching it the music is about garage band good .  I agree one star is too good. I will sell you my copy if you email me. You will at least feel that your band has a real chance to be poorly videod doing some oldie band material - find a guy named Young to play in it and you will have one up on these guys.",1039392000,23,687,4.088888888888889
1396536,1,B000056BPE,"This was one of the most deceptive products I have ever seen. The
ad never mentions the fact the Young,Stills, and Messina are not
in the show. I received the package and didn't even bother to open it. This is a total insult to Buffalo Springfield  and the
ad is very misleading. I can't believe that Stills and Young gave them permission to do this.",1016150400,40,350,4.384615384615385
1396537,1,B000056BPE,I think my garage band back in the 60's did a better job than this group of misfits.  It never made it out of my pc to my living room dvd player.  Don't waste your money.,1011916800,26,170,3.6944444444444446
1396538,1,B000056BPE,"[....]If this were a band playing county fairs, it might have some kind of audience. The DVD itself is the worst one I have ever seen. Half the time it is out of vocus. There is no proper lighting. There are artifacts everywhere. Don't be fooled by ""Buffalo Springfield"" being in the title. Don't be fooled by this being a DVD. A one star is too generous.",998956800,15,355,4.313432835820896
1396539,3,B000056BPE,"The first concert i ever saw was the Buffalo Springfield in February of 1968 and what a show it was. Although Stills was performing his boogie version of ""For What It's Worth"", never my favorite rendition of the song, Stills and Young performed a ferocious twin lead attack on the classic ""Bluebird."" Only two members of the original Springfield, bass player Bruce Palmer and drummer Dewey Martin appear on this video. They do attempt to recapture the ""magic"" of the original but fall well short of the original Buffalo Springfield in concert.",996883200,10,543,4.913043478260869
1396540,1,B000056BPE,"When you think of Buffalo Springfield the first names that cross your mind are Bruce Palmer and Dewey Martin, Yeh right!  This is one of the biggest rip offs I have ever seen.  The performances of this no-name group of wanna bees is poor at best.  The overall technical quality of the DVD is very poor, which in this case is good.  It masks the inadequacies of the musicians.  Amazon.com deserves some of the credit for this disappointment, since they did not make it clear that this was a garage band headed by the only two members of Buffalo Springfield that had little or no talent of their own.  If you are considering this DVD, you would be better off eliminating the middleman and flushing your money directly down the toilet.  That's where this DVD belongs.  This gets one star since they do not allow for anything lower.",979689600,5,828,4.547297297297297
7931736,3,B000056BPE,"I have not seen this DVD, so maybe it's unfair I should write this, but I feel this lineup of Buffalo Springfield deserves some kudos,even if the DVD is poo, and rating it was the only way I could get in, so I gave it three stars. I was too young to see the original Buffalo Springfield live, but I caught this lineup sometime in the '80s in at the Zephyr Club in Salt Lake City. The only downside of the whole show I remember is that Bruce Palmer was so overweight he had to sit on a stool during the entire performance, which I did not criticize, I only felt sorry for him. The concert was outstanding, from start to finish, and Dewey Martin was a powerhouse on the drums. And yes, the vocalist sounded extremely like Neil Young, but it only seemed fitting, as Young was an original member. I went away thanking my lucky stars I was fortunate enough to be there, and I'm sorry for those of you who bought the DVD and were disappointed. Because at one time in their career, they really rocked.",1465603200,,994,4.264550264550264
7931737,1,B000056BPE,"Come on. Bruce Palmer and Dewey Martin could be replaced in a second. Fact. Neil Young, Stephen Still and Richie Furay were the Buffalo Springfield. Its like going to a Steppenwolf concert without John Kay. There are members that carry the band and others that don't. Sorry my vote is this DVD is a rip off.",1308096000,,307,4.5
7931738,4,B000056BPE,"Do your research folks.  Do the other reviewers even know what they are complaining about?

Bruce Palmer is to Buffalo Springfield as Roger Waters is to Pink Floyd.  Bruce Palmer has as much right to put together a Buffalo Springfield band as Roger Waters does with Pink Floyd, or David Gilmour for that matter.  Messina??? you must be joking, great musician true, yet a stand-in for Palmer all the same.
This is a great piece of Rock and Roll history as Buffalo Springfield allows Bruce Palmer to bring the music he helped create, from the band he was instrumental in putting together to re-live it's glory days for it's fans.

This show is only one of many over a 6+ year period that this incarnation of Buffalo Springfield as Revisited (at least he made it clear from the name unlike other band reincarnates) played.  Drummer Martin signed on shortly after reforming, and Stills sat in on more than one concert.  These guys even played the Jerry Lewis Telethon, and were hugely and extremely well received.

Stills and Young supported Frank Wilks bringing life back to their music as frontman, and even honored him by stating that he did their music better than they did.

To follow this version of Buffalo Springfield more closely, [...] he carries on with the surviving members blessing, bringing this timeless music to the fans.

I wish there was more and better footage available of this era.

7931739,2,B000056BPE,"I was looking for a reunion concert or a documentory.  This is neither, it's a band called ""Buffalo Springfield Revisited"" in concert.  There are a couple of old Springfielders, the bass and drums I think.  In fairness, they do a decent job of covering the original band, the lead vocalist has a very Springfield tone.  Not what I was looking for.",1232841600,,347,4.639344262295082
7931740,1,B000056BPE,"1. As usual, the best advice is to check carefully to see what you're purchasing.  This item has been properly described- you just need to do something you used to do when you were in school: READ THE DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY before purchasing.

2. To correct a comment in one review, it is Bruce Palmer, not Dewey Martin who died recently.

3. Additionally, beware of items purporting to be the rumored ""Stampede"" album. According to all members of the real Buffalo Springfield, the ""Stampede"" album idea was NEVER agreed to by Buffalo Springfield themselves.  It was a studio/record company idea that the band rejected.

4. If you want to know more about Buffalo Springfield (including ""all the dirt"" you'll ever get out of the band members, I recommend you get Richie Furay's excellent biography of the band. (and NO, Richie didn't ask me to mention this- in fact he doesn't even know me!)",1182643200,,889,4.822368421052632
7931741,1,B000056BPE,"In reading the reviews of this dvd, I must add that in 1969 I went to a concert in Sacramento, and was never more disappointed when the ""Buffalo

Springfield"" turned out to be merely the orignal drummer and none of the

great stars (Stills, Young, Furray); the fact that Bruce Palmer is in this

group may give instrumental credibility, but it is still the same rip-off

product started by Dewey Martin.",1169942400,,403,4.633802816901408
7931742,2,B000056BPE,"A band that spawned Neil Young, the great Stephen Stills, Richie Furay, and I almost forgot Jim Messina, should be represented by a better DVD.  Yes Dewey Martin and Bruce Palmer were original band members, but when was the last time you ran into someone who knew that, without scurrying to their old vinyl to look it up.

If you don't care about the history of the band, and you have no idea who the people mentioned above are, you should have no problem enjoying this DVD.  Otherwise buyer beware.  They chose all the right songs, and the vocalist can manage to sound a little like Young & Stills at times but they still fall way short.  You can catch Stills & Young on any of their bezillion DVDs.  Loggins & Messina put out a DVD last year that I liked and Jim Messina is well reqresented (it's not just a Kenny Loggins show).  Richie Furay can be seen in a resent POCO DVD doing several of his songs including Kind Woman.  I cannot recommend this DVD, the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that I am such a nice guy.",1162339200,5,1037,4.255102040816326
7931743,1,B000056BPE,"I got this thing 3 weeks ago and haven't even opened it. It's not the Springfield. Some night when I don't anything to do, I might watch it. But it's unlikely. My garage band from the 70's was much better than this because we cared and we were real. These guys should be sued for copyright infringement. How Stills, Young and Messina permitted this to happen, only God knows. Don't waste your money. Better: Buy Stills' new album, ""Man Alive"" or Young's ""Living With War."" Both are superb.",1152835200,7,489,4.568181818181818
7931744,1,B000056BPE,"I bought this DVD thinking it was the original band. After I ordered it I read that it was just Dewey Martin & Bruce Palmer.

I enjoyed hearing the Buffalo Springfield Songs. The singer had a Neil Young sounding voice, so the Stephen Stills songs didn't sound right. The 2nd song ""I Am a Child"" was my favorite & if you close your eyes you can imagine Neil Young singing it, the singer sounds similar to Neil.

The lead guitar parts sound different but I was such a Springfield fan that I enjoyed listening.

Oh, by the way. Bruce Palmer always faced away from the audience. In the oncore on this DVD he's finally facing foward.

A real reunion would have been nice, but I believe Dewey Martin recently passed away.",1132617600,13,715,4.435114503816794
7931745,1,B000056BPE,"Okay. Buyer beware and all that. Anyone who bought this thinking it was anything other than a tribute band is living in a dream world. Okay, you spent 10 bucks and you're P.O'd. I can appreciate that. But just to set the record straight, Bruce Palmer and Dewey Martin were just as much a part of the Springfield as those other higher-profile dudes we all know and love; so lighten-up. Bad mouthing them only points up your own ignorance.",1065571200,8,437,4.544303797468355
