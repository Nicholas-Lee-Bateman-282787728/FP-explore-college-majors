8745863,1,B019QUWHI2,This is a bad video in  quality. The person filming does not hold camera steady.  Not a professional video by any means.,1474070400,,120,4.409090909090909
8745864,1,B019QUWHI2,This is TERRIBLE.  I'm not picky about homemade movies by any measure.  This shot is so shaky you can't concentrate on what the instructor is saying.  The person HOLDING the video camera cannot stop wiggling and moving.  We haven't even made it through the first lesson.,1468281600,,270,4.804347826086956
8745865,1,B019QUWHI2,"The book is fine, this review is regarding the included DVD.  This instructional DVD is unprofessional to say the least.  There is a point in the video lesson that the camera operator's cell phone rings and he pulls the camera away from the teacher so he can check his phone.  This DVD is a joke.",1468195200,,296,4.345454545454546
8745866,1,B019QUWHI2,"The very first thing you notice about this video is that the person holding the video camera shakes CONSTANTLY.  It takes way from everything the instructor is trying to relay.  I play multiple instruments, piano, sax, clarinet, flute, VIOLIN and recently wanted to learn the cello.  Granted, being a piano, woodwind and string player already, there is a lot of knowledge I already posses.  My goal was to take as much knowledge as possible and translate it to cello.  The very first segment on this video provides the introductory basics of how what strings represent what notes, the parts of the cello, how to hold the bow, etc.  Unfortunately you get motion sickness trying to watch the video due the fact that the camera doesn't remain still at any point during the instruction.  A simple fix would have been to use a tripod.  I should also note that aside from the poor videography skills, the menu structure of the DVD is incredibly amateur.  You can tell its homemade.",1464739200,,975,4.755952380952381
8745867,1,B019QUWHI2,"1) DVD could not be recognized in a player that plays everything from burned cd/dvds to HD Bluray.
2) We were finally able to open it on a computer.  Even with extra speakers, everything on full volume, this music instructional video was barely audible.  Please take a moment to enjoy the irony.
3)  The video was shot with a handheld camera.  The camerawork was shakier than the Blair witch project.

This has been returned.",1464480000,,425,4.6891891891891895
