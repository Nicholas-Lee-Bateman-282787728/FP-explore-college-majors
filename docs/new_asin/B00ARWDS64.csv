5495123,4,B00ARWDS64,"Composed in 1817 for Rome between the writing of Armida and Mos in Egitto for Naples, Adelaide di Borgogna has all the signs of being a commission hastily filled by the composer to a classic template of war, revolution and romance, with a historical background of Italian significance.  It's the kind of subject that Verdi would later make his own and, without underestimating the importance of the Rossini influence, often do it with considerably more character than it is done here in Adelaide di Borgogna. It's not the composer's greatest work then, but being Rossini it's not entirely without merit either, and the right kind of singing and staging could certainly bring out its qualities. Recorded at the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro in 2011, director Pier' Alli and conductor Dmitri Jurowski certainly make the best of the work and are assisted with some fine singing performances, but overall the work still remains problematic.

The main problem with Adelaide di Borgogna is that proves to be a difficult opera to stage dramatically. There's a solid historical foundation to the work, which is based around the year 951 on the campaigns of the German Emperor Otto the Great, even if it has all the usual operatic mannerisms, coincidences and twists that we have become familiar with in historical romances. That at least gives the composer plenty of material to work with and the principal pleasure of the work then is indeed in listening to Rossini's spirited musical arrangements for the piece.  It also helps that the performance of it here under Dmitri Jurowski is simply wonderful. Regardless of whether the music is the most expressive - sometimes it's fairly conventional, repetitive and monotonous - Jurowski varies the pace and seems to pitch the tone perfectly for demands of each scene. You could hardly ask for a more sympathetic account, and it makes all the difference.

Dramatically however, it remains a little creaky, with lots of off-stage to-and-fro action in Act II. Pier' Alli's production is also a little creaky in places and a little baffling in others, but it does manage to enliven the proceedings somewhat. The approach to the sets and costume design is classically traditional for the most part, with some ravishing gold and green colour schemes. To give it a little extra dimension however, Alli uses back projections of filmed sequences and some 3-D modelling, with an emphasis (I'm not sure why) on water and rain. Although there are one or two questionable touches - soldiers in raincoats duelling with umbrellas - the visuals are striking enough to give some dramatic focus to the work and help it get through some of the duller or less inspired sections of the work. Even if they don't entirely succeed, the musical performance and the staging do their best to bring this work to life. So too do the singers, and rather more impressively.

As Adelaide, Jessica Pratt gives a strong performance of a tricky role in terms of its dramatic and singing demands, and she manages to bring the role to life with some degree of character. The drama might revolve around Adelaide, but Ottone is another critical role and it's in safe hands with Daniela Barcellona. If there are any minor weaknesses in delivery of one or two notes, it's entirely down to the demands of live performance, as otherwise they are most impressive individually and in how the voices blend and complement each other. The Adelaide/Ottone Act I duet 'Mi dai corone e vita' is just marvellous. Similarly, Bogdan Mihai and Nicola Ilivieri are good fits for the roles of Adelberto and Berengario and work well within the whole ensemble. This is demonstrated most notably in the quartet at the end of Act I, which is typically well-organised in Rossini's management and orchestration of the rising drama. Even if it never entirely comes together convincingly as a whole, it's such moments that make Adelaide di Borgogna well worth viewing as an enjoyable minor Rossini opera.

Arthaus give us another nice Blu-ray package for this 2011 Rossini Opera Festival production. On a BD50 disc, the image is fine and detailed, with the usual fine PCM stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 tracks. There is a wonderful rich, fullness of sound in this production from a relatively small orchestra that comes across well and gives the production an extra musical boost. There is a 17-minute Making Of feature on the disc, which has interviews with Jurowski and Alli, with emphasis on the unique elements of this production of the work. The disc is all-region compatible, and subtitles are in Italian, English, German, French, Spanish and Korean.",1360454400,7,4637,4.969072164948454
8557167,5,B00ARWDS64,This is an excellent production of a Rossini rarity. Daniela Barcellona and Jessica Pratt are both in splendid form. Jessica is outstanding in the lengthy scena and aria at the end of the opera. Highly recommended.,1490140800,,214,4.972222222222222
8557168,5,B00ARWDS64,"Not one of Rossini's great operas, but a delight all the same. Not only is it well sung, but it is well directed with good and yet imaginative staging. Too many operas are performed these days in ""Euro-trash"" productions where the director is more interested in himself rather than being at the service of the work, creating a continuous war between the eye and the ear. Thankfully this is not one of those. I was particularly impressed with Bogdan Mihai who not only soared over the fiendishly difficult tenor role of Adelberto, but made him a surprisingly sympathetic villain.. Bravo!",1489536000,,586,4.87
8557169,2,B00ARWDS64,"the DVD is defective, it skips and freezes and totally frustrates the listening experience.

Being in a generous mood, I will add one more star, even though amazons replacement copy of Adelaide di Borgogna is defective in the same place as the first copy. Eventually we will download everything directly. Doubtless there will be glitches involved with that process as well. Of what was playable on these disks, the music was heavenly the singing divine. The costumes seemed historically adequate. I did not much care for the set projections. We will have to wait for some student of Freud to take a stab at explaining the subliminal meanings of the umbrellas. Mostly Im disappointed I could not secure a copy that played through from beginning to end. Perhaps this is an occasion where Rossinis habit of recycling the really good bits into other operas will be my compensation.",1449446400,,877,4.925675675675675

8557173,5,B00ARWDS64,Adelaide di Borgogna is a Rossini opera that has a lot of pretty music. The performances of all are excellent.,1395446400,,110,4.55
8557174,4,B00ARWDS64,"I enjoyed the opera. It was a very good production of an opera rarely performed. The music was delightful. The conducting and playing excellent. The singing, acting, the costumes, and sets were very good. The only negative about the opera was that some vain idiot decided to interject a fight with parasols, instead of swords. It is totally out of period and detracts from the mood of the opera. Was this another form of abusive political correctness? Sword are bad? People used swords in those days to fight, not parasols. Maybe the stage manager liked the old Adam West Batman series, where Batman fought the Penguin with parasols. How can educated people be so stupid?",1384387200,4,671,4.843478260869565
8557175,5,B00ARWDS64,"Yes it is strange that the 25 year old highly successful Rossini would turn out an old fashioned formulaic opera seria after such forward looking achievements as Otello, Tancredi, L'italiano in Algeri, Il Barbiere di Siviglia and Armida. The last two in the same year and Armida with the same librettist G. F. Schmidt. But this return to old forms turned out to sparkle with rich writing for capable voices and the orchestration is right up there with the best. It was written for the Teatro Argentina in Rome (p. Dec 1817) where the Barber had premiered earlier that year. The opera Adelaide apparently died on the vine there and disappeared from memory (Rossini did use some material in later works as was his wont).
The Rossini Foundation commissioned a critical edition from Gabriele Gravagna and the noted Rossini scholar Alberto Zedda. It maybe old hat as far as opera development is concerned but it is in no way second rate; Rossini had written a dozen or more opera and knew what he was about.(He had only a few weeks to prepare before the opening; typical of his modus operandi).
The less said about the scenery and the staging the better. The costumes are fine and appropriate and the singing is great so just ignore the background jumbled videos and silly staging (battling umbrellas?!?) As they say at the ballet, nothing matters but the music! And the music is ripe Rossini. The widowed Adelaide is sung by the emerging bel canto super star Australian Jessica Pratt. Her roulades sparkle, are effortlessly produced and beautifully executed. The accomplished alto Rossinian Daniela Barcellona as King Ottone puts in an exciting and excellent performance. On the male side, new to me, Bogdan Mihai as Adelberto was outstanding in voice heft and execution and almost stole the show for me. Adelaide di Borgogna is not in the top rung of his creations, but it is now a treasured part of my Rossini colection.",1364428800,7,1918,4.832826747720365
8557176,5,B00ARWDS64,"This Rossini Opera Festival (aka ""il ROF"" in Italy) production taken as a whole probably is as good or better than any previous edition of this obscure opera in any format. There are two older CD versions. One is under Rossini scholar Alberto Zedda that features the outstanding Adelaide of Mariella Devia with a rather weak supporting cast and less than state of the art sound.  The other is a posh Opera Rara set that is somewhat hampered by the acidic soprano of Majella Cullagh amidst an otherwise acceptable cast.

Regarding the version at hand, in the title role, coloratura soprano Jessica Pratt is more than up to the task and gives a tour du force rendition of her final tripartite aria that will leave you speechless. Interestingly, that grandiose aria is the penultimate number of the score with the mezzo-soprano getting the last word with an ""aria con cabaletta"" as the Finale. After hearing Adelaide's big set piece, the actual conclusion of the opera is a bit anticlimactic, in the same way that the final scene of Lucia di Lammermoor can at times feel ""tacked on"" if the tenor is not up to the task. Fortunately Daniella Barcellona in the trouser role of Ottone is more than up to the assignment even though it probably would have made more musical and dramatic sense if the title character did bring the piece to its proper conclusion.  However, that is how the libretto is structured and as such is only one of several weaknesses in the scenario.  Consequently some might easily argue that the piece is not from the composer's top drawer.  However, in actuality Rossini really had no other choice given that with which he was given to work.  What might also bolster such an argument concerns the fact that the piece, which was composed for Rome in 1817 when Rossini was all of 25, is written in a style that is reminiscent of the composer's earliest work in opera seria... albeit with a heftier orchestral palette.  Some might further argue that this is due to haste.  However, it is almost as if the ""mature"" Rossini, being in a nostalgic mood, felt the need to briefly pause and recapture his ""youth"" in the midst of all the advancements and bold experiments of his contemporaneous Neapolitan operas. Still, while not composed in the elevated style of Otello, Armida, or Mose in Egitto, it is unquestionably the work of Rossini, the composer who always manages to charm with his facile melodies, brilliant orchestration, and incandescent vocal writing.  In addition to the resplendent arias referenced above, and the requisite whirlwind ensembles, there are a number of dazzling duets that mesmerize and charm as much as the better known examples from Tancredi and Semiramide.

While the production does not in any sense mirror the exact historic era of the action, other than some rather unfortunate and distracting projected images serving as a background, and some intermittent and rather silly stage action, some of it involving umbrellas, there is nothing totally or grossly offensive when compared to some of il ROF's productions of recent years. As such it is a somewhat relative breath of fresh air... at least as far as il ROF is concerned.  Incidentally the opera was staged at Pesaro's Teatro Rossini, as opposed the expansive Adriatic Arena.  As a result, a more traditional approach was probably dictated simply by the choice of venue.  Still, a few of those background projections are indeed overly distracting, as if the music were not attractive or ebullient enough and needed to be bolstered and somehow propped up.  Will directors ever learn to simply trust the music?  After all, composers even when not at the absolute top of their game knew exactly what they were doing!  At least, from a musical point of view all involved are expert Rossinians and as such provide much pleasure.

As is the norm for ROF presentations, the quality of the picture and sound as viewed in the DVD version is completely up to snuff.  In addition, there is the usual ""Making of"" bonus that gives insights into various aspects of the production.

So not a ""must have"" opera, and not an important piece in the Rossini canon, but an entertaining one nonetheless. If you love Rossini and Bel Canto this is certainly worth acquiring.",1361059200,21,4248,4.850622406639004
