8487635,1,B005VU52JI,"WRONG DISC!

The case was fine.  I opened the case and the disc was not A SPRING DAY.  It was FAVELA RISING, which I have no interest in watching at all.  I contacted Amazon and they refunded my purchase price.  They said I could just throw away the wrong disc which I was happy to do.",1387324800,,285,4.017857142857143
