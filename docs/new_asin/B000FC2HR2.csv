2561211,3,B000FC2HR2,"While Miller had a prophetic comment about Hillary and her election efforts two years in the future, the original Miller attraction has been missing for some time now.  He used to make such arcane references that when you got them you felt 'smart' as well as in on an insider joke.  His humor now is still entertaining but you don't have to think to follow it. The odd insertion of an offbeat reference just titillates those of us who enjoyed Miller back when...",1202428800,,462,4.554216867469879
2561212,5,B000FC2HR2,"Dennis Miller just created the best comedy routine I have ever seen. I first saw this on the airplane and had to get the DVD after that. His rants are witty, pointed and sometimes extremely mean. Lots of Democrats on the receiving end. The jokes against James Carville and Robert Byrd are particularly ruthless. And I think that's why some people hate him so much (and give 1 star reviews), because they can't live with the fact that there is no comedian (on the right or left) who is able to provide entertainment as sharp and intelligent as Dennis Miller. I don't always agree with his political views but you just have to concede that he's amazingly funny.",1196467200,8,659,4.593220338983051

2561214,5,B000FC2HR2,"I have seen this video several times, I still belly laugh at the jokes and I'll watch it again and I know I'll still laugh! His James Carville assessment alone had me crying not to mention his take on Howard Dean, hilarious! If you're totally hard left, you might not appreciate this DVD but even a moderate lib will get a chuckle.",1168041600,20,331,4.354838709677419
2561215,1,B000FC2HR2,Never liked that Miller guy. Too narcissistic. Not funny. His obscure references or his 25 cent words are too desperate. He comes off as an insecure phony. Miller's new conservative mask is also unconvincing. Now he looks like a narcissistic sociopath. Not that his conservative homies would notice or care. His new material is bunk. No wonder he's sticking with his fake news schtick (now with the fake news network - perfecto!),1165449600,5,429,4.972222222222222
2561216,5,B000FC2HR2,"People who feel compelled to categorize Dennis Miller and then review his work based on his political persuasion ought to shut the f*** up. Please spare the rest of us from having to read through your useless drivel to find an impartial review of this DVD.

I've watched Dennis Miller since his days on SNL. I've watched his HBO specials and seen him perform live as recently as last week. His ability to articulate his thoughts/feelings/observations, combined with his passion for language and his acerbic, dark sense of humour definitely makes him unique at his craft. Some may find his use of ornate metaphor's and obscure references to be somewhat disconcerting though without them he'd be just another comedian.

""All In"" features a razor sharp Dennis Miller in top form. He delivers each punch line with the precision and timing that you expect from a comedian as skillful and experienced as he is. As noted by another reviewer, Miller is not afraid to tackle a number of controversial issues and in this day and age where political correctness and hyper sensitivity have shifted into overdrive, it's refreshing to see someone challenge the system and speak his mind. The fact that he can make you laugh hysterically while doing so is gravy!

I'm not sure how anyone who enjoys watching stand up comedians can watch Dennis Miller-All In and rate it one star. Perhaps next time those people might try viewing the DVD without their heads shoved up their a****.",1160956800,43,1464,4.871485943775101
2561217,5,B000FC2HR2,"Is anyone really stupid enough to trust Amazon user reviews when politics are involved? That said, I really enjoyed this concert-Dennis makes some excellent observations that obviously impress the audience at several points, and is as always genuinely intelligent and extremely likeable. He's such a laid-back guy I would find it very difficult to dislike him personally even if I didn't agree with him the way other polemic comedians can be. There's as much liberal philosophy on display here as conservative anyway, so if you're really bothered by this concert you've got some thinking to do to sort out where you stand. If you're truly open minded I don't think you'd be offended at all.",1152921600,46,690,5.008695652173913
2561218,5,B000FC2HR2,"You know I've read the two reviews before mine and these two reviewers take more shots at the right and their political beliefs then at Dennis himself.  Claiming that the people on the right are generally uneducated.  Hey, Kool-aid drinkers, stop thinking all of us are racist rednecks who, when they aren't farming, we're out marrying cousins.  And in case your wondering, Kool-aid drinkers is a reference to Jonestown.  Obscure enough for you?  Because I've got more.  They also think Dennis is throwing his hitching his wagon with the right wing.  Dennis is the same Dennis he's always been.  Take it from someone who watched his CNBC show almost everyday.  He doesn't support everything the right does.  But when it comes to the war on terrorism, he agrees.  And that's when he ""panders"" to the right, in some eyes.  Dennis always speaks his mind, and many times we don't like it.  That's what makes Dennis Miller, Dennis Miller.  He never sells out.  He's not Hollywood.  He's not on the left or right.  Take it from a guy who has been a fan since Weekend Update and been a fan throughout his career, good times and bad.  Leave Miller alone.  If you don't like some of his newer material, because it conflicts with your view of him, you are truly sad.  I'm sick of left wing ""intellectuals"" putting down others, all while claiming they are ""open-minded"".  Too often, those who claim to be that way, are often the most closed minded.  This is why I love Dennis Miller.  Agree with his material or not, Miller always speaks his mind.",1152576000,35,1536,4.649253731343284
2561219,2,B000FC2HR2,"This was a painfully sad special to watch. Go back, watch his old comedy specials or his HBO show episodes. The real Dennis lives there.

In 2001, the world changed, and so too did Dennis Miller. His show, a smart, funny, no holds barred review of the world without a political preference, was faced with being cancelled. Wagons were circled and politics became something that people no longer found humor in. Dennis had voted for Bush in 2000 and he found himself being claimed by the right wing.

In a move of self preservation, he decided to emabrace this to keep his career alive in our troubled times. However, the intellect in his humor was not something the far right could grasp.

This special has a lot of silence in it between jokes.

At one point Dennis makes a positive comment about John Kerry and how we should honor and respect his Vietnam service when most of the Bush administration wanted to have nothing to do with that war. There were boos from the audience. Loud boos. Dennis tried to politely scold them for their narrow take on a pretty black and white comment, but the audience would have none of it.

Poor Dennis. He has to insert generic Dems names into his jokes to pander to his highly partisan audience (Harry Reid is boring, Robert Byrd was in the clan... yawn.) Dennis is trapped. No longer is he able to be an equal opportunity comedian who pokes holes at the obvious flaws of both sides.

It was sad to watch this. I love Dennis and think he deserves better. And I think he knows it too.

If he is still around in a few years, just watch. He'll edge back towards where he once was. And perhaps again greatness.",1152144000,14,1643,4.456666666666667
2561220,1,B000FC2HR2,"The Dennis Miller of old was a rarity - a performer that had no agenda and no stated political party, rather he was a good independant comic that would take pot-shots at both sides of the political spectrum when they deserved it.  After 9/11 he saw the liberal-bashing bandwagon take off and decided that it was a good way to lift his career out of the quagmire it had become.  The problem is that his new target audience is generally undereducated and incapable of understanding his love of obscure references... so his career stays stuck in the same place it was, touring casinos.  Within the next few years, expect him to take the next step down in career hell and start performing the county fair circuit.",1151971200,14,709,4.611111111111111

2561225,4,B000FC2HR2,Typical Dennis Miller humor.  Edgy and thoughtful.  Some people get it and some do not and the ones who do not are probable yucking and drooling like Pavlov's dog after every time the F word is said during a Dan Cook show.,1411344000,,222,4.261904761904762
2561226,1,B000FC2HR2,"This guy is playing the odds that his swing to the radical right will pay off in the end.  Truth is, hate and bigotry are never funny and Miller has plenty of that to go around.  It  is a sad comment on society when people seem to love his brand of humor.

If your looking for someone to make you feel better about your liberal views stop right now and buy some other DVD. But Dennis can and does make people think. And like it or not thats what your supposed to do.
I get the feeling Dennis is still a social liberal, but is a fiscal conservative and thats a good combination. And it comes out in his work.
He wants to aid the helpless and dump the clueless, not a bad way to put it.",1249776000,5,687,4.172932330827067
