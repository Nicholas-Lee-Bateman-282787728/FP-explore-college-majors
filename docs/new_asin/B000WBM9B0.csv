8222138,5,B000WBM9B0,"The Hammer Trailer Collection, originally a bonus disc given away with Anchor Bay's Blood From The Mummy's Tomb, is a compilation of 20 Hammer theatrical trailers, among them The Abominable Snowman Of The Himalayas, X The Unknown, Dracula - Prince of Darkness, The Reptile, The Vengeance Of She, Frankenstein Created Woman, Plague Of The Zombies, The Viking Queen, The Lost Continent, A Challenge For Robin Hood, The Satanic Rites Of Dracula, and Shatter (perhaps the cheesiest '70s martial arts clunker ever made). If you already have a few Anchor Bay Hammers then you may have seen some of these trailers before, but this DVD will make a great addition to your collection. All the trailers except one (Enemy From Space) are in surprisingly good condition. The theme music from The Devil Rides Out plays over the main menu.",1208217600,2,824,4.978260869565218
