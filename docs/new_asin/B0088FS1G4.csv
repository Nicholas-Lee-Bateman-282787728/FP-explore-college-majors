8526120,4,B0088FS1G4,I gave this DVD a four because while it is an entertaining anime (each episode running aprox. 10-15 minutes) I couldn't complete it because disc 2 kept freezing up. Do not trust Animeworks! :(,1424217600,,192,4.676470588235294
8526121,1,B0088FS1G4,"This series leaves much to be desired; the story is poorly written and has a simple plot: Najimi is a young girl with hopes of drawing manga however she can't draw to save her life. One day her friend, Tsuyuri, who makes a lot of money drawing doujinshi (unprofessional self printed manga) convinces her to dive into the world of doujin in hopes of making it big and raking in the cash. Along the way she realizes what a challenge it is to actually create manga people would want to read and decides to try her hand creating the best hentai doujinshi. Centered around her attempts of making hentai manga, are awkward characters, and plain clich situations that are bundled with one liner jokes, typical of 4 panel manga, however, the jokes are so awkward for such a normal situation that the entire scene makes absolutely no sense. To even label this comedy is a concept I cannot understand. It's Japanese language with English subtitles, no English dub. All in all I am more than disappointed in this series; for paying $20 I feel more ripped off than paying $80 just for 4 episodes of Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Save your money and use it on something meaningful. At least I have something to use as a door-stopper.",1410825600,2,1217,4.587155963302752
8526122,4,B0088FS1G4,It is good story about a girl who want to get into anime. The story and art work is good to fair.,1394755200,,97,3.4545454545454546
8526123,2,B0088FS1G4,"A lot of static drawings and weird transitions. The story started out interesting, but didn't maintain standards. The episodes with the voice actresses lost my interest as well. It's in my anime library, but I don't love it.",1391040000,,224,4.921052631578948
8526124,3,B0088FS1G4,"Doujin work is a really curious series. Coming in the vein of an ""inside otaku life"" story-line (similar to OreImo, Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu, or Princess Jellyfish), Doujin Work takes a humorous look at the inside workings of exactly that: doujin work. Doujin are, for reference, fan or amateur created works in the style of or drawing on anime and manga. Mostly these take the form of manga and art books. From doujin circles to Comiket, from gathering ""data"" to the process of production, Doujin Work gives funny little snapshots of this process. Each episode is short, at around 12 minutes (half-episodes).

To be sure, the show itself isn't particularly high quality and the plot lines can be a little trite. For that reason, I wouldn't broadly suggest this for viewers who have only a passing interest in anime. For anime fans, most will likely agree that it isn't the highest quality show, but that there is still something fun and quirky about the subject matter. For fans of ""otaku"" themed works, i would first suggest the ones listed above, and if you enjoy those, then you will probably like this as well.

i personally found the series fun. the short episodes meant i didn't feel like i had to invest too much time, and i generally like stories about anime/manga fans navigating the awkwardness that such fandom often creates.",1309910400,,1339,4.817391304347826
