8492005,4,B0063FL73U,"The picture here used to be for the DVD version, which said on the cover that it had six episodes on it, but has since been fixed. Thank you for the quick correction.

My only complaint now is that the 2-disc Blu-ray release has only two episodes on it, two in Hi-Def on a Blu-ray disc and then the same two on a DVD. If you're going to do that, and since we have to buy the DVD version to get the rest of the episodes, why not just put out all of the episodes on Blu-ray, or at least give us two other HD episodes on a second Blu-ray disk?

Other than that, the show is fantastic, the video quality is excellent and I would happily buy the rest of the episodes on Blu-ray, if only they were available.",1328054400,10,702,4.007142857142857
