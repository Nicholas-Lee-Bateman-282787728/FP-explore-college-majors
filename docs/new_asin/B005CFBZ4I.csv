4652623,5,B005CFBZ4I,these are great holiday movies you can enjoy with the whole family. highly recomended for all ages loved them all,1326758400,7,113,4.7
4652624,5,B005CFBZ4I,"Easy transaction and fast shipping. The movies were great and had
good picture quality. They were a nice bargain because of the four
movies that were in the dvd package.",1326153600,,169,4.666666666666667
4652625,3,B005CFBZ4I,"The only movie I thought was good was 'Song For The Season' and I wouldn't buy this set again. I think it was overpriced, but Amazon always provides great service and super fast shipping.",1325203200,7,187,4.529411764705882
4652626,4,B005CFBZ4I,"My best movie to watch out of the 3 is Song of the Season...good story ...heart warming. Thumbs up.

Olden Days Coat - do not recommend this one, since it was only 1/2 hr long. Thumbs down.
Only one photo was shown with the coat and that made it a short movie. However, I do like the idea of this movie. It should be redone as a new movie and instead of just one photo with a story, I think if several photos with several stories would be great and then the movie would be longer!

Christmas Romance....this movie should be redone with a new cast of characters. I felt Olivia NJ was too harsh in this movie. It is an ok movie not my favorite to watch every year at Christmas Time.
Sons of Mistletoe it an ok movie but not my favorite to watch at Christmas Time.",1324944000,9,761,4.100671140939597
4652627,5,B005CFBZ4I,"I'm giving this ""five"" stars for the ONE movie that was good in this set ""A Song for the Season"". It brought tears, smiles and made me laugh! The cast and acting was great, it had a nice story line and yes it's your typical lifetime movie ""feel good"" and ""nice ending"" so if you're into all that go for this movie, but skip the rest and just order this one you won't be disappointed. It is now in with with my favorite Christmas movies.",1322524800,,436,4.141176470588236

4652653,1,B005CFBZ4I,"The movies are low budget and not very good. I can't even get through watching all of them. Even though the price was low, it wasn't worth the money.",1390953600,,149,4.172413793103448
4652654,4,B005CFBZ4I,The one movie is only a short clip..kind of confusing.  Mistletoe was a great movie..well worth the cost of all 4 movies.,1389744000,,121,4.5

4652656,5,B005CFBZ4I,My family and I loved A Song For The Season.  It was excellent!  I watched it several times and loved it each time.  This will be watched in our house every Christmas season.  Our second favorite on the cd is The Sons of Mistletoe.  This is also a really good family Christmas story. These two movies make the cd well worth buying.,1388534400,,331,4.274193548387097

4652659,4,B005CFBZ4I,"I had to take one star off due to the actual quality of the movies...they seem to be like the movies we used to get in Iraq that were filmed off the big screen using a camcorder. HOWEVER, that being said, if you can get past the quality, the three full length movies are wonderful - really sweet heartwarming Christmas movies. Considering the fact that they were so cheap (I spent four dollars) they are well worth it!  I'm happy I got them but they are NOT suitable for a gift due to the quality...buy these just for yourself to give you the warm fuzzy holiday feeling. If you give them to someone else you might just be embarrassed.... :)",1385078400,,640,4.333333333333333

4652664,4,B005CFBZ4I,"I had never heard of any of these movies, that is why I bought the pack in the first place.  Each movie was enjoyable in its own

4652669,4,B005CFBZ4I,"We are not talking about Gone With The Wind kind of films with this.  But they are nice holiday treats, especially three of them the fourth is nice because Megan Follows is the star and makes it special all by its self.",1360195200,5,219,4.214285714285714

4652676,4,B005CFBZ4I,"Has many of the reviews state, it's really 3 and 1/2 movies, with The Olden Days Coat only 25 minutes.
But the full length movies are fine.  And for under $6.  I guess A Song for the Season was my
favorite, but I enjoy anything with Roma Downey in it (The Sons of Mistletoe) and A Christmas Romance
was OK.
I would recommend this set.",1356652800,,334,4.123076923076923

8465184,5,B005CFBZ4I,"This is a major bargain all the films are worth watching.  The Olden Days Coat is not a feature length film but a film short that runs about 25 minutes.  ""Sons of the Mistletoe"" is the best film of the lot but the other films are still good and worth watching.  I find myself buying lots of these films and then loaning them to family and friends.  I find sharing Christmas films at Christmas time is  sharing happiness",1474329600,,419,4.32051282051282
