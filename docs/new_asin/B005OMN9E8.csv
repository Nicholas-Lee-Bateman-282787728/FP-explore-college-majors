4854010,5,B005OMN9E8,"I've been a follower of Ellen from her Crunch videos.  Years ago, when trying to get in shape, I used her Fat Burning Pilates video in conjunction with Tae Bo (and a change in eating habits) and slimmed down considerably.  Fast forward a to 2011 and still battling the bulge and after trying countless other workouts, I remembered the results from Ellen's videos and went back.  Since March of this year, I've purchased all of her Studio workouts and let me tell you this...I've shrunk 2 sizes and I'm now able to fit into clothes that I wore almost five years ago (but now I'm about 8 pounds heavier)- go figure, and my cellulite is gone.  If you stick with her workouts...you get results: Toning, strength and cardio, with the added benefit of feeling refreshed and relaxed afterwards.

Onto the review of Power Fusion...LOVED IT.  Usually, if I'm not sweating within the first 10-15 minutes of a workout..I say it's not challenging enough.  I found myself thinking..what were these reviewers talking about?? This isn't difficult. Then I got to the middle of the workout and uh, OMG. I was begging her to stop. By the end I was dripping and today I'm sore.  Lot of new innovative moves, loved the music (nice change from the previous studio videos) and the instruction was on point.

This one is definitely a keeper although there is one tiny issue as another reviewer commented...I do have problems with my knees and this one has squats, plies, lunges and pulsing warriors, this move called earth and sky (I think) and the knees could feel it this a.m.  The one thing about her workouts is if I keep them up on a consistent basis (which I haven't for the past few weeks due to illness) my quads are strengthened and my knees will not bother me at all.  I plan to get back on track and add this one in the rotation.

If you are at all interested in some of her videos, my personal Ellen favs are: Fat Burning Fusion, Barefoot Cardio, Crunch Fat Burning Pilates and Skinny Sculpt. I can't wait for release of Grace and Gusto.

Awesome job, Ellen! :-)",1320710400,23,2051,4.555858310626703
4854011,5,B005OMN9E8,This is definitely her hardest workout. The poses are not easy and are really out of the box which I like. We need something different to challenge our body and this workout does the trick.,1320019200,3,189,4.428571428571429
4854012,5,B005OMN9E8,"I LOVED this workout!  I thought it might just be a live version of a similar earlier Studio release but I was pleasantly surprised as what a great workout this is!  I am a dressage rider and while I like the results of the Jillian Michaels type of work, I'm so tight I cannot move in the saddle.  Ellen's workouts are perfect for strength and flexibility allowing suppleness in the saddle.  I have been doing Ellen DVD workouts going all the way back to Crunch.  This one is by far, the best ever for what I am trying to accomplish.  Like the other reviewers, you get a good solid workout from Ellen but you are left feeling recharged and with plenty of energy to start your day - and in a better mood!  Cannot wait for Grace and Gusto - keep em coming Ellen! :)",1320019200,2,763,4.220689655172414
4854013,5,B005OMN9E8,"After discovering Ellen Barrett in the Self series, I've bought several of her workouts including Crunch and The Studio Series. I'm a huge fan and have often wished I could travel to attend one of her classes in person. Power Fusion Live makes me feel like I'm right there in her class! It's one of my favorites. Ellen is genuine and motivating,as usual. Her workout ""buddies"" are lovely,authentic women. The moves are new and hit all areas of the body. Transitioning is natural. Challenging enough to work up a sweat. I like it so much that I can't wait to fit it in my busy day. I hope Ellen does more just like this!",1319587200,2,619,4.43859649122807
4854014,5,B005OMN9E8,"I own every Ellen Barrett DVD that is available.  I love them all, but there are always some that are my ""favorites.""  I can tell this is going to be one of my favorites.  I haven't been able to find her signature dance, yoga, pilates blend anywhere else!

Things that I love about this workout:

-It's barefoot

-It's graceful - I don't feel like I'm jumping around or doing anything clunky

-It's controlled.  No matter how many times I do one of Ellen's workouts, I feel that I can always improve part of it.  The amount of muscle control can make the workout infinitely harder.  So even when I feel that I've mastered a move, I realize, I could be pulling my core in tighter, I could be making my movements more precise.  I like that attention to detail.

-Ellen isn't annoying.  I have a real problem with some DVD fitness personalities - their voice ... their yelling ... their lack of encouragement ... or just their general annoyingness - Ellen is upbeat without being obnoxious.

-Stretching.  Even when you're in the cardio portion of the workout, the moves encourage stretching your muscles

-I actually feel good when I'm done with this workout!  I'm tired, but my body feels good!

If you love the basics of pilates, yoga, and dance, but want to ensure that your cardio is at a good level - this is a great workout to start with!",1319500800,29,1342,4.4979253112033195
4854015,4,B005OMN9E8,Just finished it for the first time. Really liked it and my heartrate was up and I was definitely sweating. Went by very fast. Only complaint would be I wish there was alittle more arm toning. Other than that it was great and definitely make it's way into my DVD rotation.,1319068800,,272,4.352941176470588
4854016,4,B005OMN9E8,"I love Ellen Barrett.  I discovered her with Barefoot Cardio.  I quickly bought every other workout I could find.  The strangest and best thing about them was that even though the moves were similar (moves I LOVE,) every workout was different and interesting - music always motivating and complimentary.  The time just flies by with her, and I think one of the keys for me is how she breaks you in ""gently"".  No shoes helps.  I can literally drag my barefoot self in front of the tv wishing for a nap and slowly I get into this and I'm rejeuvenated and drenched by the end of the video.  Okay, enough about how great she is, now for this particlar video. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 (because it is a great workout) is because of a move called ""heaven and earth"" which basically reminds me of bending down to pick up toys and putting them up on a high shelf.  I have 3 smaller/medium kids and this move is NO fun.  I can't even pretend I'm dancing, meditating, or frankly even exercising - I'm WORKING! And the kicker is that Ellen mentions in this video that she doesn't include any planks, which people either love or hate.  I neither love or hate the plank, but if she did planks in a workout as much as she does the ""heaven and earth"" move, in two variations, in this one, then I WOULD hate them.  I find it curious that she takes out one move that people disdain and creates another.  I believe it's this move that's hard on the knees.  Knees are my weak spot as well and I was afraid to try this, but was fine when I did.  The rest of this workout is so good, I will continue to do it and just substitute another one of her fabulous moves during one of the heaven and earth variations.  This workout will definitely raise your heart rate and keep it up, and I am so grateful that she made another ""fat burning"" type workout.  Fusion Flow works me out HARD and I'm drenched at the end, but my heart rate monitor doesn't show the same target zones hit as her fat burning intentioned workouts.  Also, I don't like a lot of mat work, and there is none in this (that I can remember.  There is one ""yoga-lite"" type move at the end,) but if you don't like being on your stomach, this is a good one.  And if you love Ellen, get this one unless you have bad knees or are a mom who dreads picking up toys!",1318896000,14,2321,4.186936936936937
4854017,3,B005OMN9E8,"This is a fun, fluid workout..  that I will have to give away.  There are continuous squats/lunges at the core of the workout that help build your heart rate..  if you have knee problems this one's probably not for you. (I exercise with proper form, but that doesn't fix the missing cartilage in my knees!) I love Ellen Barrett and have a number of her DVDs..  I just wish there had been a clearer description of this workout, so I would not have wasted my money this time.",1318204800,54,473,4.340909090909091
4854018,5,B005OMN9E8,"I did Power Fusion for the first time this morning and LOVED it! I really don't have any complaints. I thought the cardio was slightly more intense than in her Studio series (in a good way) and I sweated a bit and felt fantastic afterward. I honestly used to believe you couldn't get good fitness results without pushing yourself to the limit, in a kind of no pain no gain way, but Ellen's workouts leave me feeling so good afterward that I hardly ever reach for anything else, and guess what? I'm getting great results! After 1 1/2 months of working out 4-5 days per week, my arms, legs and especially glutes are more toned, my waist is definitely slimmer and I have such great energy. Instead of trying to find excuses not to work out (I'm too tired, not enough time, etc.) I find myself looking for any excuse to sneak in a 45 minute workout each day. Instead of feeling exhausted and foggy afterward, I have more energy and am in a better mood all day. All I can say is ""keep 'em coming!!"" I can't wait for the upcoming release of Grace and Gusto, as I now own all of the Studio workouts, and most of her earlier ones, too!",1317168000,37,1127,4.295774647887324
4854019,5,B005OMN9E8,"I got, I did it, I loved it!

I got home from work at 3:15pm, I got it in the mail at 3:30pm, I did it at 4:45 and I just finished it. I really loved it! I loved the moves-all different from her previous routines! I loved the set and the backgrounders too! It went by so fast-even though it is Ellen's standard 45min length! The only move I need to work on is the Threading move. My heartrate got up to a nice fat burning zone and a moderate sweat! The music was great too. I feel it in my legs and waist, even though there was not a ton of ""ab"" moves per se, it is her usual sneaky-easy-looking-yet-tough formula. She is a Pilates/yoga fusion genius! No one else can fuse these disiplines like her-I have tried many. This is a great addition to my Ellen collection. I now can't wait until her upcoming Grace & Gusto!!!! Grade A.",1316736000,25,829,4.117283950617284
4854020,5,B005OMN9E8,"Great teacher.  Great workout.  I like the flow and fusion of dance, pilates and yoga moves.",1471478400,,92,4.6875
4854021,5,B005OMN9E8,This workout cd is great! It's just right for me; I always feel energized after doing it.,1455235200,,89,4.294117647058823

4854023,5,B005OMN9E8,"I love Ellen Barrett.  I had a trial of this workout on cable on demand channel.  I loved the workout so much, I had to own it!",1447200000,,127,3.6666666666666665
4854024,5,B005OMN9E8,"This workout is exactly what i was looking for - a truly low-impact, sweat-producing cardio routine. It also builds lower body strength. When Ellen says at the beginning that the workout seems easy, but you'll feel it the next day, she isn't exagerating. My legs were sore for 2 days after and i'm in good condition. I hope this production company will create more low-impact workouts in the future.",1446940800,,399,4.797101449275362
4854025,5,B005OMN9E8,"Very good workout. It focuses on the lower body and abs. Its very refreshing after you complete the workout.
I am a great fan of Ellen Barrett's workouts.
Shez extremely good. I would recommend everyone to try this workout dvd.",1437091200,,227,4.7
4854026,5,B005OMN9E8,"If you are used to doing Level 3 Jillian, Cathe, and/or Jari Love type workouts, this review is for you.  Those are the workouts I usually use, and I have been resisting trying Ellen Barrett for a while, being convinced it would neither leave me panting or sweating.  These two things are usually a requirement for me because I only devote 30 minutes a day to exercise, and in order to stay in the good shape that I'm in, I knew it would have to be a challenging 30 minutes.  If this sounds like you as well, read on...

I finally tried Ellen with Skinny Sculpt, and found it to be a deceptively challenging arm workout, though the cardio was not enough for me.  I enjoyed this workout, and I have to say I felt great afterward, but I will only do it on an off day or along with my own 15 minutes of intense cardio to feel like I got a complete workout.  I then tried Yogini - which is challenging for the legs and lower body, so same deal with that one - not enough cardio, but I wasn't really expecting anything with that one.  Again - time flew by and felt great afterward.  These are longer than my usual workout times, but since they are much less intense than what I usually do, that's a good thing.

Power Fusion is by far my favorite.  I did much of the workout holding hand weights, making it similar to Skinny Sculpt, but this one is more intense than that one, and challenges the lower body more as well.  This upped the cardio and the toning, and made this into an enjoyable, yet effective and complete feeling workout.

To summarize, Ellen's workouts have their place.  If you're looking to get sculpted, protect your bones, or to improve your heart health -  there's no way around a classic weight workout and good old-fashioned moderate to intense cardio.  Ellen's workouts won't do that for you on their own, but then again they don't claim to.  Ellen often mentions her workouts creating a softer, more feminine looking physique, and I believe her workouts will accomplish that.  Her workouts are totally non-dread and enjoyable, and you will feel great when you're done.  Mixing up your workout routine is a great thing for your body, and Ellen's workouts are a great way to do that.  I prefer a more sculpted look, so I'll stick with my heavier weights and more intense workouts for the most part, but I will definitely add these into the rotation, and will, I'm sure, look forward to those days.

This is probably the most intense of Ellen's workouts, so if you're advanced and you want to give her a try, this is a great one, and add those hand weights if it doesn't feel challenging enough.",1432771200,14,2612,4.436058700209643
4854027,5,B005OMN9E8,Great workout.  Perfect pace for someone new to exercise.  Easy to follow.  Offers more intense options for those who want it.,1429401600,,126,4.904761904761905
4854028,5,B005OMN9E8,Love this workout. I have done hard workouts that burn a lot of calories. Power Fusion works different muscles. It gave me an extra boost of energy I needed to challenge myself.,1428192000,,177,4.5625
4854029,4,B005OMN9E8,My Mom was very happy with this gift!,1424995200,,37,3.75
4854030,5,B005OMN9E8,"Another fabulous workout by Ellen Barret.  Like her other workouts, the focus is on fusion fitness, whole-body movements, cardio/strength/stretching all rolled into one.  She incorporates many disciplines into each workout; this one focuses on yoga- and dance- inspired movements.  About 35 minutes moving on your feet, then about 10 minutes of mat-work, cool-down, and stretching.  The one movement in this video that may be difficult for some people is a move where you bend down to touch the ground, then reach up to touch the sky, and repeat.",1416182400,,546,5.170454545454546
4854031,3,B005OMN9E8,I was somewhat disappointed by this workout. I haven't did it too much but find the moves a bit tedious. I really liked the sculpt express one.  Perhaps it will grow on me. I love most of her dvds for the most part and feel they have made a big improvement in my body.,1404259200,,268,3.962962962962963

4854033,5,B005OMN9E8,"I happened upon an Ellen Barrett workout that was on demand with my cable company. It was the Grace & Gusto workout. I was hooked! I ordered Grace and Gusto and a few months later, saw this Power Fusion DVD and decided to give it a try. Another great workout. I find myself enjoying the moves so much that the time flies by. At the end, I feel strong, graceful, and invigorated. It's it so enjoyable, you almost don't notice what a great workout it is. Its my therapy! If I am having a bad day I just pop one of Ellen's DVD's in and I always feel better when I am done. I can't wait to try some more!",1398643200,3,600,4.008333333333334
4854034,5,B005OMN9E8,"This barefoot fusion workout is awesome! I can't say it enough, I enjoy working out with Ellen Barrett, its like working out with your BFF, her cuing/transitioning from one move to the another is spot on & the exercises are never boring & they vary from workout to workout! No mental gymnastics when doing any of Ellen Barrett Live workouts plus they're effective! There's something relaxing/energizing about working out barefoot, I've now a convert! It doesn't mean the workout is less intense, in fact, its quite the opposite. This 46min workout goes by fast. This power fusion workout is definitely sweat producing! I would highly recommend this workout, along with Ellens' 30min super fast body blast, sleek sculpt express, 46min grace+gusto, 30m pick your level weight loss pilates & the 46min fusion floor workout.",1397260800,,820,5.126865671641791
4854035,5,B005OMN9E8,"This video is about 45 minutes long.  If you are not familiar with Ellen Barrett, she does workouts that are low impact, barefoot, and relaxing.  If that sounds too easy, let me assure you that you will get your heart rate up and be challenged with strength and flexibility as well.  I must admit that I do her videos on my lighter days, but I feel that they provide the opportunity to break from strenuous workouts and still feel that you are benefiting your body and mind in other ways.  Do not think that if you are highly fit that you will not reap benefits physically and mentally from this workout, but at the same time, if you are a beginner or intermediate exerciser, don't be afraid to try this workout!  Ellen Barrett is low key, knowledgable, and encouraging.  I highly recommend this video.",1396828800,2,802,4.534722222222222
4854036,5,B005OMN9E8,"This is one of those dvds that you can pop in right when you wake up and get your work out over with. It is not too taxing but still a good, worthwhile workout.  It is easy on the joints, no jumping around, but still effective.",1396828800,,227,3.9347826086956523
4854037,5,B005OMN9E8,"I ordered three of Ellen's DVDs at the same time. They are all good, but this one I feel like is the best workout (for the time and variety).  Having said that. I do the other thirty minue ones more often because finding even 30minutes to exercise is a blessing.  My youngest is now 3.5, so I can generally get 30 minutes out of him while he is watching his show.",1394841600,,363,4.098591549295775

4854040,5,B005OMN9E8,"I love this workout.  Like all of Ellen Barrett's workouts this one is just a little different.  There is more emphasis on toning moves, however these toning moves are done as such fairly moderate pace that my heart rate stays nicely elevated the whole time.

It seems that every move is well thought out to get the maximum effect.  There is a series in the middle where, standing, you touch the floor next to your feet and then reach up with a slight twist and touch the sky on you toes.  It feels like you are working every single muscle in your body - including your heart!

The tape ends with some leg toning on the floor.

It does not just focus on one muscle group.  I feel stronger and more coordinated after doing Ellen's work out DVD's for a month.  I have purchased 3 of the work outs so far. There is also one on You Tube you can try.",1374883200,,355,3.9577464788732395

My favorite EB workout til this one was Burn & Firm Pilates. They are so different though both works my entire body; I felt every muscle during the workout and the next day. Power Fusion seems slow at first and like you're not doing much, however as it goes along, you realize the deliberate movements at the pace Ellen sets is really making you focus on using the muscles and not just slinging your body around. Ellen Barrett is my favorite instructor and I will definitely try more in her Live series. Loved the way she conducted the workout and loved the workout!!!",1362355200,,697,4.5396825396825395

There are a lot of plie's which have definitely slimmed down my inner thighs. If you do her workouts correctly, your heart rate will really go up. But you can variate it for your own level which is fantastic. The first time I did one of her workouts I didn't think it would really do much but they are surprisingly difficult without all the jumping around which hurts my knees and lower back. Her workouts are all about lengthening your muscles without bulking them up (which I don't want).",1361664000,,621,4.408695652173913

4854051,5,B005OMN9E8,I just tried this dvd for the first time this morning.  I just love this newer fusion dvd!  I have to say it is way more challenging than the older fusion dvd.  I love that Ellen is creating more challenging workouts.  I wouldn't say that this isn't for beginners though.  I believe all of Ellen's workouts are for all levels.  If you get to a section you just can't do just do something you can do until you get it right.  You won't be perfect right away that takes practice.  This is gonna be one of my favorite Ellen workouts because I know I'm gonna be feeling it all week.  I highly recommend this Ellen dvd.

4854056,5,B005OMN9E8,"For me, home fitness has been the heart of my exercise routine, while that puts me in the minority as a male, since I have been a fan of home fitness for quite some time, I feel somewhat qualified in saying I know a great workout when I do one! For me, it has always been about the whole body, and too often I've done workouts that train the outer, not so much the inner, wanted to find an instructor that covered all bases, Ellen Barrett, for my $$$, is just that. To the naked eye, this DVD didn't look like much of a challenge, but boy, was I pleasantly wrong!! The moves themselves are basic in their nature, but because they target the entire body, the challenge is indeed there!! At the end of the day, for me, it is how did it make me fell when finished, and this one made me feel great. At this stage of my fitness journey, it is great to get a challenging, gentle on the joints, barefoot workout that gets the job done, I recommend this to both guys and girls equally, approach it with an open mind if you're a guy who would normally shy away from a fitness DVD that doesn't look too tough, you may just be surprised at what you find! Terrific!!

4854057,5,B005OMN9E8,"Ellen Barret creates DVD's for the home exerciser to use when jumping is not an option.  I workout 5 days at week at home, teach 4 classes at a fitness chain (2 yoga, 2 step per week) so my fitness level is pretty high.
I always to go Ellen Barret when I want a good workout, but don't want to jump and or hop.  I like to alternate this DVD with a plyo based workout or step workout
What I like about this DVD is my heartrate does raise to a fat-burning level, but does so gradually and with out the high impact.  I do add one-pound weights during the workout (one in each hand)and also focus on reaching and extending to help raise my heart rate.
This is as good as a low impact workout gets.  I just wish the cardio part was a bit longer....but I just rewind and do the cardio part for 50-60 minutes.
I enjoyed this one and will add it to my collection.",1345161600,,855,4.041420118343195

Many of the twisting movements are so  good for my body that gets so stiffened from working in front of the computer all day.  This exercise program loosens my body as if I got a therapeutic massage and puts me in a positive mood.  I highly recommend it to everyone with neck and back problems.",1340496000,3,501,4.461538461538462

4854061,5,B005OMN9E8,"Ellen Barrett has a beautiful way of incorporating cardio and strength endurance training into a lyrical graceful flow. Her cues are very specific to what you may be feeling and inspire you to keep going. The flow of the work can be done in a very gentle way, if there's fatigue on a certain day, or it can be done in a more challenging way by going deeper into the movements with a bigger range of motion. Either way, her workout is excellent. Those looking for a fast or explosive workout may be disappointed--this is a steady rhythmic flow where the arms, legs and feet move in a well-defined, deliberate pattern with a variety of movements. This is the perfect all-purpose workout for me: it's athletic enough to be challenging, but gentle enough to be safe for the joints.",1330732800,6,777,4.597122302158273

Perhaps i'll use this later on during my pregnancy when I'm too big to do more vigorous exercises.",1329955200,,351,4.086956521739131
4854063,5,B005OMN9E8,"I love love love this exercise video and Ellen! Ellen is always upbeat but not over-the-top. She isn't cheesy or obnoxious and I feel like she is very genuine in her videos. Its fantastic that this video is a live workout because you really do feel like you are in Ellen's studio working out with her students. The workout itself is not difficult to follow at all. Ellen never moves so quickly that you feel lost (one reason I have always loathed work out videos). She knows just how many reps to do to make you feel it but without pushing you too far. There are many times when you feel like you don't know how much more of something you can do and its like Ellen reads your thoughts because she will transition to something else for awhile, then come back to that movement and push you again. If you are looking for something INTENSE this is NOT it, but it is a good workout for people who want to get energized while slimming their body. Ellen's workouts always leave me feeling great and this video is no exception. She has definitely sold me on exercise (and i never thought that was possible!) and I recommend all of her Live and Studio videos.",1328832000,6,1150,4.378504672897196

4854067,5,B005OMN9E8,"I first came to know of Ellen Barrett from FIT TV (which was later deleted from our satellite package) and I loved the flow and intensity of her workouts. I needed to start an exercise program after years of being a couch potato so I ordered ""Skinny Sculpt"" and ""Crunch - Burn & Firm Pilates"" (which are still 2 of my favorite workouts), but found that my knees bothered me from all the plie squats (I was nearing 50 and already having some knee pain). I powered through the workouts until my right knee became quite swollen. After taking a break due to illness, I returned to the workouts and was careful not to overdo it. Over time, my knees became much stronger and now, a year later, I regularly work out to many of Ellen's dvds (as well as a couple of Jillian's) and it's as if the tendons in my knees have strengthened to where they were in my 30's. When Power Fusion became available, I immediately ordered it. Time flies by in this dvd and I love many of the combinations. As some people have said, the dvd does have some twisting vertical moves, but the other day I actually found myself doing some of the same moves while doing housework and it struck me that these are actually very natural moves. Plus they improve balance and become easier with practice.
All in all, another great dvd by Ellen Barrett. She's my fountain of youth.",1323475200,7,1343,4.419354838709677

I honestly love how I feel after this one - ""exercised"" but also relaxed and full of energy. Don't get me wrong, I do sometimes really like my higher intensity workouts, but this one is truly awesome, and I suspect part of it's effectiveness is how controlled it is. It's a great combination of pilates, yoga, and cardio.

Ellen is a very enjoyable instructor - she's pleasant to listen to, and not at all annoying. She's great at combining pilates and yoga with some cardio in her workouts, and at providing workouts that tend to make you feel like you got a good workout without a lot of stress. I will say that much like other reviewers have mentioned, you may have a problem with this one if you have an issue with your knees. This wasn't a problem for me, but that's partially because what little issues my knees gave me in the past cleared up when I started working out again after the birth of my seventh baby. So if you do have knee problems, you may want to start with a different workout of hers and see if they improve a bit before heading into this one.

I highly recommend this workout - as I stated before, it's my favorite Ellen Barrett workout so far and one that I'm always happy to do!",1490227200,,1797,4.947019867549669
