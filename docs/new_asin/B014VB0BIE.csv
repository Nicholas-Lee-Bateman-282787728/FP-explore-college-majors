7424894,4,B014VB0BIE,"Strange how they have an image of Voyage 5 but not of Voyage 4 as I write this.  Perhaps Funimation is having a hard time figuring out who to put on the cover of Voyage 4.  Magellan?  Ace?  Jimbei?  Buggy?  Bon Clay?  Hannibal?  Mr. 3?  I'd opt for Jimbei because he is an awesome new character.  At any rate, Luffy finally arrives at Impel Down, the Supermax of the One Piece world, to break out his brother Ace.  With Hancock's help he manages to sneak in but after that he immediately starts making trouble.  Along the way, he runs into some familiar faces that in some cases he helped to put in the prison himself.  Being the charismatic guy he is, Luffy convinces his old foes to fight on his side.  But the chief warden Magellan isn't going to just let this escalating prison revolt succeed.

Some might wonder what the 4 episode filler right in the middle of this Voyage is all about, where Luffy fights a dude in a sombrero who captains a submarine and tangles everything in nets.  These episodes, of course, were a promotion for the Strong World movie which Funimation released on DVD/Blu Ray ages ago (not too long after the movie ran in Japan).  The central villain in that movie, Shiki, is only hinted at occasionally in the filler episodes.

Impel Down resumes after the filler and will continue all the way through Voyage 6.  Nice that there is only about a 1 month wait between 4 and 5!",1448150400,3,1401,4.423529411764706

8731939,4,B014VB0BIE,"As good as any anime by Toei (meaning the animation is s***, but it follows the manga accurately enough) I suppose. It would have been nice if Ivankov could have had a more Tim Curry-ish voice, but it's good enough for what it is.",1463875200,,230,4.25
