6877652,1,B00QRBBYEM,"I loved this show when it was on the air, and I was excited when it came out on DVD.  The problem is that the first DVD would not play.  I tried it on four different players, so I ask for a replacement ,and the replacement did not play.  I am surprised and disappointed that AMAZON would not have some type of quality control in place.",1422316800,5,335,4.045454545454546
6877653,1,B00QRBBYEM,"The freaking DVDs won't play! I have tried every DVD playing device known to man to play these DVDs and none of them work. I even tried backing it to another DVD and that failed as well. My computer does not even recognize it as a DVD.

The MOD manufactures need to address this quickly because this is inexcusable! I read that some people got replacement DVDs that don't work either so that tells me that whoever is making the DVDs are not paying attention to the quality of their product.

I won't even bother to order another one because someone will feel my wrath if I get another bad copy!

I have had several MOD DVDs sets that never gave me problems so this needs to be fixed!",1421280000,8,683,4.27906976744186
6877654,4,B00QRBBYEM,Four stars for the show - Zero stars when it comes to the release of the DVDs. I was willing to pick this up (for cheap though - $9.99 or so is my limit) especially to watch the episodes that ABC never aired. (They couldn't even burn them off online on their site or send them to Hulu.com - struck out with the bases loaded there - LOL!) Hopefully they fix the problems with the DVDs.,1420243200,5,384,4.065789473684211

6877656,5,B00QRBBYEM,5 stars for the show!  ZERO stars for the set as the DVDs will not play!!!!!!!  Hoping my replacement set will work properly.  (MOD) is a great idea but wish there was greater quality when producing these as this is not the first set of MODS that I have had problems with.,1420070400,,272,4.1923076923076925
6877657,1,B00QRBBYEM,"These DVD's will not play on any device:  Computer, Blu-ray, DVR, nor DVD - which can play all regions & all formats!  This is a manufacturing error which needs to be addressed right away!!!",1419984000,6,190,4.5588235294117645
6877658,1,B00QRBBYEM,I love this show but my DVDs also will not play. I am sending it back right now and am hoping my replacement works.,1419897600,4,115,3.8333333333333335
6877659,5,B00QRBBYEM,"**Update 9-4-15**

Re-purchased after last customer said his worked, and I can also confirm my set, both discs play perfectly...
They must've fixed whatever was wrong with the burn on discs after all these months...YEY...

Love this show...a classic cancelled way too soon....The problem isn't the show, it's the dvd...it simply does not play!
Had my first set replaced and the second set did not work either...just says ""disc not compatible"" on blu ray player and dvd players...
have bought many ""made on demand"" titles in the past and all play perfectly...(i'm aware of certain types of player restrictions, etc)...
Had to return both sets..the original and my replacement copy....i hope this issue gets fixed, as i'd truly love to own this and add to my collection and be able to watch it...
if anyone else out there has had this issue, please post here..and if you've gotten a copy that actually works...please post as well...",1419379200,8,930,4.955128205128205
8692483,5,B00QRBBYEM,"Another great series, foolishly canceled before it could find an audience. I have read numerous complaints that these MOD DVDs didn't work on buyer's DVD players, but they worked perfectly on my seven year old Magnavox player. A great product!",1520812800,,243,5.1
8692484,5,B00QRBBYEM,"This was a really good show (it sucks it got cancelled) and I wanted to buy this earlier, but I was hesitant because of all the comments about how the DVD-R's didn't work on most people's DVD Players. I eventually gave in because the price was reasonable enough and I also didn't feel like waiting anymore. I was happily surprised to find out that the DVD-R's worked perfectly on my PS3 (the PS3 is the original model with full PS2 backwards compatibility). So, while some DVD Players may have trouble playing the discs or maybe some people received bad discs, there's still hope that the discs people receive, from now on, will work perfectly on their systems.",1448928000,,661,4.6581196581196584
8692485,5,B00QRBBYEM,Just received my new DVD package and both DVD play fine - great short-lived series that was cancelled too soon.,1447718400,,111,4.6
8692486,1,B00QRBBYEM,"Amazon has this listed as a DVD-R, which is generally ok. But the disc I received is not - it is a DVD+R DL and would not play in any of the 5 drives I have. If you check the reviews, it appears that some are ok - they may be actual DVD-R discs. So caution if you intend to purchase.",1445212800,,283,3.6557377049180326

8692490,1,B00QRBBYEM,"The discs will not play on either of my players (Sony 5 DVD/CD Changer, Sony all region player) nor on my computer.  This applies to both the original and replacement copies.  I don't know is burning these discs because I've never had a problem with DVD-Rs before.  Hopefully, amazon will have another place produce them correctly.",1428105600,3,331,4.875
8692491,5,B00QRBBYEM,5 stars for the show but 0 stars for the DVD. They wouldn't play on any of my DVD players. I should have read other reviews first. I sent them back for a replacement but they wouldn't work either. I hope that some day they release ones that will work because this was a funny show. I was disappointed when it got canceled.,1425427200,2,322,4.126984126984127
8692492,1,B00QRBBYEM,I have bought many MOD titles and have never had an issue. Amazon sent replacement discs and those did not work either. I think they should pull this title so other customers don't run into the same scenario.,1423526400,3,208,4.5
