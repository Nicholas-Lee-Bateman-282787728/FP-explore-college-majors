8678513,4,B00NJ1Z28M,I remembered this movie being on PRISM the old pay TV channel in Philadelphia. It was called something Greener or something. Anyway I remember how good Geraldine Page was and wanted a copy. I'm glad I finally found it.,1453593600,,218,4.615384615384615
8678514,1,B00NJ1Z28M,"I purchased this dvd based on the story and reviews of other people.  I thought this would be a good clean family film but importantly for the spiritual message.  However, I was very disappointed that not too far into it three curse words were blurted out in front of my children.  I don't know how many more there were because I threw it in the trash.  Oh, and the picture quality is TERRIBLE.  Not worth $20 dollars.",1449532800,,418,4.376623376623376

8678516,4,B00NJ1Z28M,"Made on a low budget in 1974, this quiet, insightful adaptation of Merle Good's short novel ""Happy as the Grass was Green"" would probably be called an independent film today. Certainly no major studio would make such an intelligent, contemplative film these days, where ""nothing happens"" -- except that an angry, troubled young man with fierce but disillusioned ideals attempts to find something deeper, more meaningful during his stay in a Mennonite community. And for a time he does, embracing the simplicity, the bare-boned honesty, that many young people were seeking in the early 1970s, when so many ""went back to the land"" & rediscovered Christ -- remember ""Jesus freaks"" back then?

But as Eric discovers, things are never so easily black-&-white. The film depicts the Mennonite community in dimension, showing flaws as well as beauty, and reminding us that there's seldom a quick, all-purpose answer for our existential problems. Eric's pursuit of & love for Hazel, the daughter of the preacher Eli, is more a pursuit of an idealized image than a flesh-&-blood young woman -- something that Hazel herself realizes before he does. And Eric in turn comes to understand that while he has indeed found some measure of inner peace, he can't ignore the problems of the larger world -- poverty, war, injustice. It's inevitable that he must return to that larger world, having grown inwardly, but still struggling to find answers.

None of this is told in typical movie melodrama -- and don't think it's too solemn & serious, either. While you won't find stupid jokes, there's a good deal of warm humor in this story, drawn from everyday life & the personalities of the characters. Little moments will stick in your mind -- the tender, sensitive Sara, too easily mocked by other teenagers; the hired hand Eric works beside & befriends; Geraldine Page's soft-spoken mother with compassion for this hurt outsider who's momentarily filled the void left by her own son's death; and Pat Hingle as Eli, a truly good man willing to face his own flaws & always opting for love rather than scorn.

For some, the quality of the film transfer will be an issue. I'd love to see a really good remaster, if only for the beauty of the countryside & the subtle play of emotions over the faces of the characters. But the story itself is worth seeing, and more than once. Given the current condition of the world, the meditative & spiritual qualities explored here are more important & pressing than ever -- recommended!",1426636800,,2502,4.89622641509434
