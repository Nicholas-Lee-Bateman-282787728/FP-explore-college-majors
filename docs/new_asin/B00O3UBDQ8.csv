6708579,5,B00O3UBDQ8,"Welcome to Woodhaven a town somewhere in Saskatchewan, Canada where the local radio station is sponsored by the `Liquor Donut' store and there is an annual `Drink and Shoot' as we all know how guns and alcohol are an ideal mix. The local cops are not to be regarded as role models either. Officer Lou is an alcoholic who has stopped bothering to cover up his peccadillo's.

Then after he is called out to `an incident' he wakes up feeling like he is a changed man. He gets up early, can smell and hear better than before and finally has an interest in his work, as if that wasn't bad enough he also seems to be a lot more furry than before. What could have caused such a transformation? Well you will have to watch the film to find out or just get a big clue from the title of the film.

I ruddy well loved this - yes it starts out a bit shaky at first and I felt a twinge of regret. But then it picks up the pace and the laughs start coming. For a cast of unknowns they all do really well and must have had a blast making this. Writer and director Lowell Dean ('13 Eerie') has got the balance right between ludicrous plot, over acting, plenty of laughs and even some gore for splatter fans. Check, out the posters in the police station too `Puppy Poaching is a Crime' - genius.

It runs for around 75 minutes and for me that just shot past, this is not a huge budget affair either, but the quality of the script more than makes up for it. I enjoyed it so much I forgave any little hic coughs that were made. If you want to kick back, have a laugh and watch some mindless fun this should fit the bill. The sequel is being made and is imaginatively being called `Wolfcop 2'.",1418342400,18,1673,4.141538461538461

6708582,5,B00O3UBDQ8,"Wow! What an amazing ride, I knew from the beginning that it'd be a B movie, but I never imagined that it would be as immensely enjoyable as it was. It seems the creators were trying to change the entire Werewolf ritual and they actually succeeded at it.
A fully self aware Werewolf Cop with a craving for donuts and a drinking problem to boot, and it's the booze that actually makes him stronger.
I see that Werewolf Cop 2 was made after all, I know that I'll definitely be looking forward to watching it when it becomes available on Netflix, Amazon Prime or HBO.",1500681600,,564,4.380952380952381

6708584,2,B00O3UBDQ8,"All that fantastic publicity material, a killer title logo splashed across a plethora of excellent posters, a premise that hints at a potential adult version of Teen Wolf and somehow, it all falls apart in execution. This indie Canadian horror comedy, though evidently a passion project, just doesnt have the goods to deliver as promised. Despite the hard-ons from JoBlo and BloodyDisgusting, the film is not much more than ambitious borefest.

6708587,4,B00O3UBDQ8,"This movie starts out by being everything that is wrong with movies and then turns that around 360 degrees into being completely insanely awesome. It alternates between being graphically disgusting, violent, and sexual without ""really"" ever crossing a line into being exploitative of any of those concepts- but it's not clear exactly where that line is, other than probably way beyond what the American rating board would give an R rating. Let me repeat that, because the trailer does not make this clear- THIS MOVIE IS WORSE THAN R RATED and the trailer does not really show that. If you don't want kids to learn what exactly happens to a penis when its owner turns into a werewolf, don't let them watch this movie.",1484092800,,716,4.782258064516129

6708594,2,B00O3UBDQ8,"I was REALLY expecting to like WolfCop so much that I watched it twice because I didn't care for it all that much the 1st time I watched it. The 2nd time I watched it, I thought it might be better the 2nd time around,It was a little better but about the same. WolfCop is a good movie but it was kind of blah. My main problem is that it really didn't get started until there was about 35 minutes left in the movie. It was good enough that whenever part 2, 3, whatever comes out & I get a chance to see it, I'd take a look at it. I'm hoping that part 2 will (Maybe) make me like part 1. I guess I'll wait & see. If somebody asked me if they should see WolfCop, I'd definitely say give it a shot. I didn't like it as much as I thought I would but maybe you might",1467849600,,759,3.779874213836478

6708605,2,B00O3UBDQ8,"When you are buying a cheaply made movie about a ""wolfcop"" you expect it to be a little more fun and entertaining than this film was.  It did have its share of ludicrous moments but frankly, not enough.  To be honest, it felt like the director was in on the joke of the premise but still wanted to make it as serious as he could.  I think a little more edge or self awareness and it could have been put in a cult type of category.",1460592000,,430,3.9767441860465116
6708606,2,B00O3UBDQ8,I think the positive reviews are biased in some way. Maybe this was some low budget film producer with a lot of friends or they paid them to write favorable reviews. It is not a good movie. I kept waiting for it to be good like many said it was. It didn't deliver in any way. It actually became more absurd later in the movie. The special effects were high school to college level. The acting by most characters was decidedly bad. Just not a good movie. At elast it had a quick bit of nudity to save it from complete disgrace among B-movies.,1460160000,,541,4.211538461538462
6708607,3,B00O3UBDQ8,"After all the hype this movie received it is kind of a let down. It's not bad but certainly not great.

I'm rating this as a low budget independent movie. So I'm not giving it 3 stars against a major hollywood production. Simply put the plot is lacking and the acting is below average.

The wolf makeup and costume is just ok...nothing special, we've all seen better....no CGI here.

Ultimately what hurts this movie is a poor script. I enjoyed the novelty of a werewolf cop, however they didn't do enough with it. After making a big deal about the wolf car, it was barely shown...and it didn't look good to begin with. I just feel like they could have done more.

Also, do we really need to see a fake male penis pissing blood? In this day and age where we have seen just about anything, there is no real shock value here...it's just stupid.

Nice try...but no better than average...I've seen a lot better independent movies lately.

Recommended for werewolf completists and those looking for something different in horror.",1457481600,,1024,4.629834254143646

6708611,4,B00O3UBDQ8,"If you cant determine by the title that this was going to be a cheesy B-movie, then you need to watch more horror. Neflix kept suggesting I would like it, and I figured their algorithm should know me by now, so I gave it a go. Thank you Neflix for letting me know about this gem.

I will admit I almost turned it off 15 minutes in because of the acting of Officer Lou Garou (Lougarou, in one of various translations, is werewolf in Haitian). He just wasn't tough enough, or cheesy enough to pull it off. But the actor, Leo Fafard, finally found his groove, but suddenly he had the right about of cheese with his swagger.

I could see this becoming a cult classic. There were lots of quotable lines, and the blood and gore was completely over the top. When Lou turns into a werewolf, chunks of his skin falls off, as his fur pushes through. And the bathroom after his first turn and kills, is completely covered with blood and guts.

Besides Lou, the other characters were just as amusing, and I need to get myself a Liquor Donut shirt!

Wolfcop 2 : Breed the Wolfpack! is supposed to be in production, and I know Ill be watching the movie when it comes out. If you enjoy Werewolf puns, Cheesy B-Horror Movies with splatters of Gore, I say youll have a Howlin good time with WolfCop.",1454630400,,1282,4.329166666666667

6708615,3,B00O3UBDQ8,"Very silly, cheap, comedy horror. Watch the trailer before you dive in to give you an idea if this is the type of movie you feel like. But, the trailer tells a slightly different storyline than what you're really going to get. The trailer tells the story of an alcoholic werewolf cop, sounds like a pretty funny concept, sadly, the real story is a werewolf fighting ""changelings"" for his life. The werewolf cop storyline is only about 10 minutes of the actual movie, and it's certainly the best 10 minutes in the movie. Wolfcop tries hard to be silly and irreverent but there's a lot of hit and miss with the jokes and the plot seems stretched to fill the already short 79 minute play time. The movie drags for long periods of time while we don't build any further character development and wait for the real plot to begin. If this were edited down to what it really should have been we'd only have about 40 minutes on the screen. For what it is, it's not terrible, it's just not nearly as good as it thinks it is.",1448236800,,1014,4.37037037037037

6708621,5,B00O3UBDQ8,"This is one of the best new horror films ive seen in a long time. Great dark humor mixed in with the horror, a different & enjoyable werewolf film. The acting was good, the music was good & the effects were very well done. The gore & especially the transformation was so well done, best ive seen in a werewolf movie since An American Werewolf in London. Basically the story revolves around one of the laziest cops youll ever see on film, a dark secret some of the town people have, an ancient Werewolf curse & a cycle that repeats itself every 30 yrs that involves a sacrifice. The cast did a great job with their characters especially Leo Fafard as the main character/wolf Lou Garou. The disc has a lot of nice features also which includes the original concept trailer for the film. If you are a horror fan, a fan of dark humor horror films or a fan of werewolf film I must say this film is well worth watching & owning.

1. This is probably the first werewolf movie I've ever seen with an exploding penis.

2. The further the movie progressed, the more hair appeared on my body.

3. I mean, it just EXPLODED right off the poor guy's body!

4. The acting, special effects, cinematography, etc., are all top notch. Well, as top notch as anything called Wolfcop could be expected to be. Better, than expected, really.

5. BAM! SPLAT! Penis exploded.

6. This is, all around, better than I expected and a whole heck of a lot of fun.

6708632,3,B00O3UBDQ8,"On paper, this is exactly the type of film I easily fall for.  In the flesh, so to speak, it failed to deliver what I had hoped for, what I had expected based on the reviews of others.  Instead of soaring, it fell with a dull thud.  Part of the problem for me is failing to see the humor in an alcoholic cop (Leo Fafard as Sergeant Lou Garou alias WolfCop).  It also didn't help that I found the character less appealing as a drunk, preferring to see more of him as WolfCop, which they neglected to do, having wasted most of their time on the build up.  The plot is simple and to the point, dealing with local corruption on an occult level.  The bad guys are shape shifters requiring werewolf blood in order to continue their reign of terror.
This is not a big budget big studio production.  In spite of that, the FX is quite good, the level of gore very satisfying (I would have asked for more).  The humor is sporadic and inconsistent in tone.  There's nudity and wolf sex.

It's hard wired right into the Wolf Man, Dracula, Nasferatu, Metropolis, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, the Mummy, then back to the super ancient German horror films, usually of the same subjects. There's not a great deal of gore in Wolfcop, but there's enough guts and bloody detached body parts to go around. The transformation is rock solid, and challenges the best. Good one-liners.

There may be no explanation for what happens, and no clear rhyme or reason for the entire film for that matter but it's still a bit of a romp of gory fun no matter how you view it.

A rather unique way for the man-to-wolf transformation, with the outer shell simply splitting and falling away to reveal the wolf. Though it isn't shown, one supposed the change back is accomplished the same way. One wonders what happened to all that shedded dermis anyway.

6708645,1,B00O3UBDQ8,"Ughhhh!! There must be some pretty desperate viewers (Well, Saskatchewan as the source local for most everyone involved goes a long ways to explain my despair over script, acting, props, prosthetics.)
Fantasy can have it's own reality in the viewer's mind but tossing out junk that makes no sense like this film does strain credulity to no end.
1. Several hundred year old Satanist style peoples that can instantly (and I mean instantly) change from one sex to another or from really young to really old. Some trick - I'll have what ever they're having! Why do these stories always take place in some out-of-the-way hole-in-the-wall? If I had those powers I wouldn't be stuck in remote Saskatchewan.
2. Wolfman, who almost instantly sheds/peels off his human skin (just leaves it hanging lose on the ground) to show a wolf growing inside then just as quickly (when the Moon is just right), suddenly has the human skin and all functional muscles, organs in perfect original order.
3. Some how,as a wolf, he still likes booze and can talk. Sure!
4. Acting, dialogue just as sparse as the storyline. Most actors have TV series, shorts and movies no one has ever heard of as the sum total of their acting resumes. Not to disparage honest work to pay the bills but lets not overstate the hyperbole.

Main actor is wooden (but that might not be his fault). Story takes too long to get off the ground, then any number of potentially hilarious situations just kind of fall flat.
The writing is (mostly) there but I think no one told the director that this was a comedy. So he had the actors play it straight.

Wolfcop.  It's fun. It's funny.  Novel storyline for a werewolf movie. Some serious gross-out scenes that may require looking away.  Very regular-looking-folks cast.  Homemade-style SFX. Hilarity ensues.

How to watch this movie:  Essentially, switch the picky, critical part of your brain off and enjoy it for what it is (see above). You will thoroughly enjoy it.  If not, you did not sufficiently disconnect enough reason, logic, and critique.  Unplug more of your brain and watch it again.  This movie, and the recent similar releases What We Do in the Shadows, Hellbenders, and Suburban Gothic are great indie films that are fun to watch, plain and simple.

FYI- I enjoy and appreciate the depth and superlative stories of R. Scott movies; imagination of the entire worlds in L. Besson's head; Scorsese's epic masterpieces; Kurosawa makes me watch B/W and enjoy it; (blah-blah-blah).  Let movies, like this one, be what they are and enjoy it.  IDK about you, but it's cool to watch a flick that didn't cost a $1/4M to produce, but is just as entertaining.",1431302400,4,1367,4.861471861471862
6708650,4,B00O3UBDQ8,"i watched wolfcop, a movie with very few ""redeeming characteristics"", but loaded with b-movie goodness. an alcoholic, small-town police sergeant is used in a ritual that involves lots of cutting, dripping blood, and satanic symbols, becomes a werewolf, and finds himself thrust into an interesting power struggle among the town's leadership. only he and another deputy in the sheriff's office seem interested in getting to the bottom of the proceedings, and, as luck would have it, his new powers prove to be very useful in the service of crime-solving.

wolfcop knows exactly what it is, and the lead, leo fafard, does a great job as lou magrou, a guy who is just doing a flat-out sh***y job at being a man, a detective, a human being. his partner, fellow sergeant tina, played by amy matysio, is much more serious and motivated, of course, and their various pursuits dovetail nicely when he starts turning into a werewolf. corrine conley as the silver, seductive mayor bradley, is kind of awesome.

werewolf transformations are obviously difficult to put new spins on, but wolfcop succeeds admirably for a low-budget, indie b flick. lou's skin literally sloughs off his body as his transformations occur, with claws shooting out of his shoes, and skin tearing across his back and falling in sheets. it's cool stuff.

my wife and i both laughed out loud on many occasions, the world of wolfcop includes a store called liquor and donuts (""everything you could need""), and the exteriors of regina are simply gorgeous. there's a little too much gun play--he's XXXXing werewolf, what's the point if he aint tearing people apart?-but nonetheless, wolfcop is good fun, with nice, gooey practical effects, solid performances, and a good directorial eye.  i look forward to more fun from director lowell dean, and eagerly await wolfcop 2!",1431216000,,1831,5.033003300330033

If you want to judge wolfcop by the standards of a big budget Hollywood production then you will surely be disappointed. Wolfcop knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything more and I enjoyed it more for that fact. Now while I did enjoy wolfcop there were several things I fill really did not work out that well in it. For one it feels they threw a million jokes at the screen to see what would stick and while some do work it isn't as many as I would have liked. Also I wish they spent a lot more time with the cop in werewolf mode as that was by far the most exciting portion of the movie. And lastly the story I felt was sorely lacking. Now having said all that I found the practical effects very nice and the movie itself to be a fun time but ultimately  for the most part forgettable. Still old school horror fans or anyone intrigued by the idea of a werewolf as a cop I believe would get enjoyment out of this movie just don't expect to be blown away.",1429401600,,1068,4.061611374407583

6708665,4,B00O3UBDQ8,"https://areviewofthis.wordpress.com/2015/04/13/this-is-wolfcop/

he credits and opening shot-plus-filter make you think you're getting Grindhouse, but once the title appears, that train leaves the station becoming something else entirely.  In fact, up until Lou Garou (clever, right?) becomes the Wolfcop, the movie is mostly uninteresting.  Lou is an alcoholic in a small town.  Small town people do small town things.  Some punks dressed as pigs rob a place.  You know.  But once Lou gets that pentagram carved on his chest in the middle of the night, things start looking up.

Special effects are a mix of An American Werewolf in London and Little Monsters.  When Lous transforming, its the former, when hes Wolfcop, its the latter.  When someone gets their face ripped off, which happens with some frequency, its also the former.  Wolfcop as a person is a little the Punisher if the Punisher was a werewolf.  Bullets don't hurt him, except a blunderbuss the Shapeshifters use.  Yup.  Shapeshifters.

Lets see.  Theres a fairly involved sex scene with Wolfcop which is a little unnerving.  Wolfcop is extra strong because he drinks while hes a wolf.  Oh yeah, and the best part of the movie is:

BAD GUY:  Where are you?

WOLFCOP: The fuzz.

And then Wolfcop shoots him in the face.

For those looking to be scared silly then this is definitely not the movie for you, it's not scary in the least. But it is really great for a few good silly laughs if that's what you're looking for.

When I first heard about WOLFCOP, I didn't realize it was a horror-comedy, and therefore I rolled my eyes and shook my head.  But when I discovered it was meant to be funny, I knew I had to see it.  I like lycanthrope, and I was intrigued to see a perspective on how it could be funny.  And wow, Im glad I watched it!  Writer/Director Lowell Dean has a big hit on his hands, and it delivers on many levels.  If you have had any reservations about seeing this film, wipe them all away and give it a shot.  Its fun and entertaining, with some great effects and a lot of laughs.

I love how campy WOLFCOP looks, with his blue fur and Beast-from-X-Men-style make-up.  Im not sure if this is intentional or not, but Beast is who I thought of every time WolfCop is onscreen.  This is not a bad thing at all, as the image and style of WolfCop works for his characterbut I felt like I had to mention it, as many other viewers probably thought the same thing as me.

WOLFCOP is shot well and looks very professional onscreen.  The production value appears high, and the film team does a great job with utilizing their budget.  The acting is tight, the special effects look great, and the story is mysterious.  Overall, you cant ask for much more.

Although I enjoyed it immensely, there are a couple of minor flaws I have to point out.  First, there are a couple of things in the film that are not explained.  For example, when WolfCop first transforms in the bathroom of the bar, he kills a couple of thugs that have arrived for some reason.  When the thugs walk in the bar, they immediately head downstairsto the bathroom.  Why?  Were they there to kill WolfCop?  Later, the bar owner tells him he saved her lifebut she never saw the thugs to begin with?  This confused me.

Also, there is a love scene between WolfCop and a woman that lasts way too long.  Im sure its meant to be funny and campy, but I just kept raising my eyebrow, wondering when it would end.  Its not full of gratuitous nudity or anything, but it didn't serve much of a purpose in my opinion.

Still, WOLFCOP is a heck of a film, and I highly recommend it.  Its got some excellent dark humor, not to mention some high-caliber special effects.  I particularly like the scene where WolfCop tears off a thugs face in a meth lab, and the guy runs around for several minutes screaming about his face.  Gruesome, but well done and funny (you just have to see it!).  WOLFCOP is available now in a variety of formats.",1427241600,2,2559,4.292887029288703
6708691,5,B00O3UBDQ8,"Plot points that some might consider spoilers.

Lou (Leo Fafard) is a substandard cop who likes a bracer before, during, and after work. He loves the new liquor donuts store in his quiet Woodhaven town. A murder has cancelled the local ""Drink and Shoot"" event, and Lou has been turned into a werewolf by a local group of shapeshifters.

When the DVD cover looks like ""Teen Wolf"" one expects a good deal of cheese and tongue-in-cheek remarks. In that aspect, this film didn't disappoint. I loved the dialogue, background posters, radio broadcast, and biting remarks. The writers spent some time on the film and saved money by getting a local Canadian band ""Shooting Guns"" to do the soundtrack.

Fun horror film. Well done.

This was made in 17 days for 1 million bucks. That is incredibly impressive. I have never heard of CineCoup before. Basically you go on their website and vote for films you would like to see. The winner gets a million dollar budget to make it. This is a democratic and safe way of giving cash to the right filmmakers.
These guys from WolfCop knew what they wanted to make from the beginning, though I suspect they weren't too sure of a story line, that being the two different trailers I saw.
This movie is more like American Werewolf in Paris in its tone, but way faster. I absolutely love the actors and actresses, who are these people and why have I never seen them before. All characters are clear cliches of different genres, but they managed to be very interesting. I love the classic 60s vixen, looks like she walked out of a Superman comic. The crazy dude was more like an 80s conspiracy theorist. The wolf cop reminded me of a deputy in my area that got fired back in the 80s for having sex in his cruiser.
The area they shot this in looks like it could be in Alabama or Canada, (I think that's what they went for anyway).  People can say what they want and I'm sure its not for everyone. But if you love werewolves and love clichd films that poke fun of different genres then this is a must see for you.

I'll admit, Drink and Shoot is a funny idea.",1426550400,4,363,3.918918918918919

6708701,5,B00O3UBDQ8,"This movie is too awesome.  This is the next ""Evil Dead"" and a must have for any movie buff.  I can't wait for WolfCop 2.",1426291200,3,121,3.8
6708702,3,B00O3UBDQ8,"I bought this on DVD yesterday, the 12th, at a ""Wal-mart"" for a few cents less than $10. It that a missprint on Amazon that it's to be released on May the 12th...or did the store jump-the-gun. Perhaps that's just for the Blu-ray junk-format. Don't pre-order it and don't spend more than $10.

- I thought the beastiality part lasted much too-long. They might have tried to make it seem funny by having romantic music, but it just didn't work in that way it what ruined this mostly for me. Of course, some would say that a man who's a wolf sometimes and not a 'real' animal doesn't count. Still, it would have been better to have just had it imagined: there was a kiss and then they showed the other guy outside going to a vehicle, who heard a howling and made a comment like ""What a beast."" However, due to the fact that the woman was a shape-shifter, that revelation was actually a part of the story so it's a bit forgivable.

- I wanted to see Lou get back a bit at the dude who kicked the dog and I didn't think that would happen -- but he did scare the dude and prevent more animal-abuse after the credits so that was good to see. Earlier, he passed-by two people defacing a wall with paint...and later, he gave his own 'graffiti' to them using his wolf-pee. As for the people he ignored beating someone up (which he also observed but just drove by), I didn't see those folks get punished.

- I think I might have liked this more if, as the wolf, he was still kinda drunk at times and messed-up. That could have brought some laughs if he slurred his words or missed punching someone. Then it could have been more character-development if he started to realize that, with this ability, he's able to be a better cop and doesn't have to drink.

- He's a terrible WolfCop. In the meth-lab (which had an awesome explosion, by the way), he was just killing everyone. Those 'poor' drug-dealers. I would have wanted to just see the destruction (""Incredible Hulk""-like) and, if needed, stopping of those who were trying to hurt him. Heck, I think I'd have had a good laugh it I saw him actually try to arrest people and read them their rights.

- There was a part in a bar, during the WC's first transformation in the bathroom, dudes came in
a side door and went right to the bathroom. Wolfy killed 'em except for one. This woman saw some of the person run away. Later, Lou goes to the scene to investigate and eventually asks the woman if he hurt her when he was the wolf. She told him that he ""saved"" her. She was never even being attacked, so I don't know where that came from.

This might be something she said because of a scene in one of the trailers that's not in the movie. WolfCop saved a woman who was evidently about to be raped (apparently, this same woman -- I forget). Even if it wasn't, he stopped one woman from being hurt in some building and then wanted to help her up. To me, that was a scene I wanted to see.

I'm actually thinking that this was not in the movie because, as the shape-shifter, nobody would have been attacking her and needing rescue and it wouldn't have made sense. I think it was from a time when, perhaps, the story had it as the woman wasn't always a shape-shifter.

- ""WolfCop II"" is displayed near the end as coming this year as well. I'm not really that excited to see it, so probably won't.

All-in-all, it's a semi-decent movie that's only 79 minutes (so, about 75 minutes excluding the opening titles and the credits at the end). It's pretty gory at times, with a few decapitations and a face ripped-off + the dude still walking around. There were brief funny moments and it's too bad there weren't more. I'd recommend this for a viewing, but I don't consider it to be a must-see and not something that ""your eyeballs will never forgive you if you miss this one"" as quoted by someone on the packaging. ""Dog Soldiers"" is still one of the most-enjoyable werewolf flicks. For a non-werewolf monster flick, more creativity -- and drunkenness (not that I encourage anybody to do that) -- ""Grabbers"" is the way to go.

The ending was decent and I'll give it 3 stars which means, at Amazon, ""It's okay"". I lean more towards 2 & 1/2.",1426204800,2,4166,4.356958762886598
6708703,4,B00O3UBDQ8,"Didn't know what to expect with this film.  Just a B flick with tongue in cheek humor.  I loved it and I'm usually pretty tough on B horror flicks.  A alcoholic useless cop in crime ridden town is turned into a werewolf.  Regardless, he is a cop first, werewolf second.  Behind some pretty good makeup he sets out to straighten out the town.  It was well acted, well directed and did have plenty of tongue in cheek humor.  There were 3 robbers working the town in little pig masks that he had to take care of, huge meth labs and even teens defacing building with spray paint.  For what I expected to be just a hokey B, turned out to be fun werewolf romp with a new superhero.  A werewolf cop who loves his alcohol and donuts.  An adult werewolf flick to leave you smiling.  Well worth a watch for fans that enjoy a good werewolf chuckle.",1426118400,7,837,4.267515923566879

6708708,5,B00O3UBDQ8,"I had so much fun with this movie, its such a great ride from beginning to end, its just such a crazy idea and it works so well, Basically a small town drunken cop who is a bit of a nobody is out on a random call one night and is attacked by a strange cult, when he wakes the next morning his senses are heightened and at night he starts to change into a hideous hairy beast! It changes his life for the better and starts to clean the town of its scum as WolfCop! This movie is certainly destine for cult status in no time, its been a while since something this fun came along, its not only bloody and gory and violent its also funny and has great well timed humour, the cast is really good too, great choice all round especially Sarah Lind (Steven Seagal's true justice series) good to see her in a such a great movie looking so sexy as ever! The soundtrack is top notch too especially the end credit song! And you have to love the old-school poster art, well presented all round, this is a classic already I feel, make sure you check this out, the most fun movie this year!
This movie started as a trailer and took ages to get off the ground and finally get made, the featurette on the disc goes into a lot of detail on this, im so glad that it did eventually become this feature, its only a short movie but we do have a promise of WolfCop 2.",1419379200,27,1344,4.0754716981132075
