8571908,2,B00365FEGG,"It focused on putting ornaments, garland and flowers on the tree, nothing any 10 year old can't do. When finished it was a pretty shotty looking tree. No information about lights or how to do anything professional looking at all. Very disapointed. I gave it 2 stars because it has a section on wreaths and bows. 95% of which any small crafter can do. I got 2 ideas from it, learned nothing new. Do yourself a favor buy a book you'll get more from it.",1357689600,,450,4.305882352941176
8571909,5,B00365FEGG,"I love, love, LOVE this video! It starts a little slow with some basic tree set up tips, and helpful guidelines about how much lighting to use. Once it progressed to Garlands I was hooked.

The techniques in this video will save HOURS of time and give better results.

It is the only video/kindle guide of this genre that I have been able to locate.

If you want a gorgeous tree in less time then this is the guide for you!",1354320000,,423,4.197530864197531
