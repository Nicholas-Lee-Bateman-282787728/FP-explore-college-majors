7921685,5,B00004S3AM,"If you want an entertaining approach to learning about Costa Rica, I recommend it.  It's a little off the beaten path.  It's a great ""extra"" film for the classroom.  There is just one part at the end that I personally do not want to show my students but since it's the end of the film it's easy to just stop the film at that point.  Otherwise it's worth checking out.",1221696000,,367,4.2
7921686,4,B00004S3AM,"I viewed this video several times before travaling to Costa Rica. I found the tape very useful in making travel plans and used the author's tour suppliers for most of the trip.
The video was fun to watch and was fast paced action thoughout!",969926400,2,240,4.4772727272727275
7921687,4,B00004S3AM,"If you're interested in adventure tourism then this is the place to start. Having traveled all over Latin America with the actor, Jay (The Stankman) Stanka, I can say the video accurately portrays what's available in Costa  Rica.
Jim Carr does an excellent production job. All the way from filming  participants bailing out of helicopters to jumping off one of the highest  bungee jumps in the world.
Costa Rica is the happening place for travel  on the edge, while remaining in the confines of a safe and settled  country.
Get the video before you decide to book one of those disney  world eco-tours.
