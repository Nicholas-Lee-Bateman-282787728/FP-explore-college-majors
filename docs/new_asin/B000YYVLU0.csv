8234531,4,B000YYVLU0,"All of the techniques shown on this DVD are within reach of the average person's physical capabilities.  It's not about martial arts - it's about self defense:  reacting decisively and confidently if a situation gets bad, and then getting out of there.  My primary motivation in getting this DVD was to find some self-defense basics that I can work on with my kids.  It works.",1394409600,,376,4.7384615384615385
8234532,5,B000YYVLU0,"It was very clear, well constructed, used alot of common sense; The instructor was very knowledeable about body mechanics and martial arts.",1387152000,,139,5.363636363636363
8234533,2,B000YYVLU0,"I purchased this dvd in reference to all the highest of recommendations.  However, this dvd is kinda okay, but it is surely not 4 or 5 star material at all.  The techniques presented are fairly decent, but can be overly complicating for someone who is merely trying to defend themselves from an aggressive attacker.

This dvd would be good for an advanced student in karate.  However, there are many better forms of self defense out there.  If you want realistic and simple street self defense in dealing with real life attackers then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Paul Vunak's ""Street Safe 1"".  Ill let him explain the rest in dealing with an attacker on the street, enough said.",1302566400,3,669,4.724137931034483
8234534,5,B000YYVLU0,"Love this DVD! The lessons are very to-the-point, and easy for my daughters to follow and remember. It is giving them the confidence they need in school to deflect the bullying that is very prevalent (and tolerated by staff) these days.",1265932800,,236,4.780487804878049
8234535,5,B000YYVLU0,"This is a great self defense DVD, you don't need any martial arts training, it makes more sense and is so much easier to put to use.",1254441600,3,132,3.925925925925926
8234536,5,B000YYVLU0,"My last fight:  1965 in the second grade.

My first Self defense video: Michael Pace.

My reason for purchasing: I wanted to know what really happens in a real fight, in real life.

My endorsement:  Michael Pace tells you what really happens in a real life fight, he tells you what you can do about it, and he tells you. . . ""you can do it.""

My deepest fear:  I called the number on the DVD to ask a question and got Mr. Pace on the phone just by accident.  He took time to graciously answer my questions and then I told him my deepest fear, that I would not be able to violently strike someone because I am too kind hearted--but I want to defend my family. Mr. Pace said ""when necessary you have to be able to throw the switch""[sic].  I know that this personal conversation from my DVD instructor Mr. Pace will prove invaluable to me if I ever have to defend my family  from street violence and I am grateful to him for being the kind of instructor he is: a kindhearted person who is expert in fighting and when necessary can use it for the good. Thank you again Michael Pace.",1220832000,3,1078,4.189320388349515
8234537,5,B000YYVLU0,"As a Sensei specializing in street self defense, this DVD is a must have for any Martial Artist.  Shihan Michael Pace has put over 40 years of experience and knowledge in producing his excellent series of DVD's.  I have incorporated much of his material into my classes and my student love it.  It works!",1220572800,4,304,4.592592592592593
8234538,5,B000YYVLU0,"I have purchased all of Michael Pace's self defense DVD's.  They are the best in the world.  I have a huge collection of self defense and martial arts DVD's and Michael is the best instructor around because he knows how to teach.  He explains everything in an easy to understand manner.  He is logical and gives you great advice as he demonstrates these easy to learn techniques.  I have taken other self defense courses such as the Israeli Haganah system and from my experience I think that Michael Pace's system of self defense using the F.A.S.T. system and the bulletman training is far superior to Haganah.

8234539,5,B000YYVLU0,"I am an attorney and a Ju Jitsu blackbelt.  I grew up in a rough neighborhood and was often forced into street fights. The street has no mercy and no patience for fancy self-defense performance. Every move has to be extremely simple, quick and effective.  One count is best.  Two counts may still be acceptable.  But if you have to count to 3 to finish your move, you're out or dead.  The simpler is a move, the better.

Shihan Michael Pace's Self Defense 101 is among the best self-defense teaching materials around.  Actually it is the best self-defense material I have ever seen.  Mr. Pace truly understands criminal psychology, the effect of the adrenaline rush when we are under attack, and the need for extremely simple and effective moves.

I strongly recommend students of self defense to learn from this DVD.  On the street, the ability to stave off a potential attack is the first line of defense.  And when a fight must happen, simplicity could mean the difference between life and death.",1219190400,16,999,4.716763005780347
8234540,5,B000YYVLU0,"This DVD is very easy to follow I thought the moves were very practical and explained well. Some of the techniques are very simple, yet effective.
Good info to know so if anything like an attack happens, you're not left wondering what to do. Buy it!",1219017600,4,249,4.434782608695652
