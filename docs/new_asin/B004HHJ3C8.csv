8429535,1,B004HHJ3C8,"I love these guys, pay top dollar to see their shows when I can.  This DVD was not was I was expecting so of course I was disappointed.
If you ever get the copy of Stortellers of KOL in DVD form please let me know.  I thought I was buying that. Greatly looking forward to their upcoming show in Vegas, bought 7th row seats with pleasure.",1403222400,,337,4.090909090909091
8429536,1,B004HHJ3C8,"Being a somewhat avid fan of the Kings, I will give most merchandise a chance, such as unauthorized biographical books and even this ""documentary"". I'm not sure who truly thought that this production could be deemed a documentary, but they were incredibly wrong.
Documentaries tend to contain a lot of fact-checked information which has been scrutinized to ensure authenticity, or at the very least offer a disclaimer from the beginning letting you know that some of the opinions are exactly that, opinions. Not here. This ""documentary"" touts the opinions of the interviewees as fact, and contains the typical tale of the beginning of the Kings, which most fans have already heard, and then goes down hill from there. There aren't any interviews with individuals who have actually encountered the Kings, or are perhaps acquaintances of the Kings, rather just some random people who often share inaccurate details about the band that they probably found in a gossip magazine.
Two interviewees pronounce our beloved lead singer's name ""Call-ubb"", and one also speaks of how pure the Kings are in that they don't use foul language in their lyrics. Um, just for starters, have you ever listened to Taper Jean Girl? Apparently not. Another interviewee mentions that she loves ""King of Leon's"" music because there's no violence. Apparently she's never heard Trunk or Joe's Head. Caleb's ability to paint you a story with lyrics wouldn't have been overlooked by anyone who had true authority to be interviewed for this production.

The bottom line? Don't waste your time on this DVD. The grainy footage comes primarily from videos you can find online, and the information can be found if you conduct a simple search for ""Kings of Leon biography"".",1324771200,3,1739,5.080419580419581
8429537,1,B004HHJ3C8,"I watched in horror as these pathetic commentators gave their lame opinions and impressions of this incredible band. These people cannot even pronounce and enunciate words in a descriptive fashion and I found myself looking away feeling embarassed for Kings Of Leon in having such a thing associated with their music. This in no way does justice or gives reliable insight into the band or their accomplishments and the photos and clips can be easily located on you tube and google pics.. Then throw in some fools giving opinions about a band they obviously know nothing about, can't even pronounce Caleb's name and begin each answer with ""uh"".. Poor quality, completely unprofessional, in fact the worst documentary I have ever seen and should be ashamed of themselves for marketing this using this bands name and success. Anxiously awaiting VH1's Behind The Music's presentation of KOL which will no doubt showcase them as the humble, hilareous, wild, class act they are. KOL is the hottest band in the country and perhaps on this planet and will be for some time. This DVD in no way does them justice or offers them the respect they are so deserving of. I'm an avid KOL fan and am offended that something as bad as this exists to market and take advantage of the success of the band I love more than any other..",1300492800,14,1313,4.737991266375546
8429538,1,B004HHJ3C8,"I am dumbfounded that Amazon would even sell this. The entire dialogue is basically a rewrite of most articles you may read on the band. The footage is taken straight from concert footage, home videos shown on the KOL website or music videos. All of which can be seen online already. The three random women that are interviewed are so knowledgeable on the Kings of Leon that they can't even pronounce Caleb's name correctly. I hope the band can sue the producers of this video for copyright infringement at the very least. I am sorry I bought it and would return it if I could.",1300233600,9,577,4.504761904761905
8429539,1,B004HHJ3C8,"This is one of the worst documentaries I have ever seen. There are some good pics of the guys as kids, but that's about it. Most of the footage has been taken from other KOL videos already out there, such as Excess All Areas, Live at the O2, and, of all things, the ""Use Somebody"" music video. This documentary features interviews with three different ladies (their identities are unknown- we are never given any information to let us know why their opinions matter), two of whom can't even pronounce Caleb's name and keep calling him ""Cauleb"". In addition, some of the information is clearly incorrect. They keep referring to the Followills' father as ""Ivan"", which is technically his first name, but he goes by his middle name of Leon. Overall, a horrible waste of my time and the $10 I spent on it, and this is coming from a HUGE KOL fan. If you want to find out about the band, just look on Wikipedia. You'll get better information there.",1300060800,8,942,4.547058823529412
