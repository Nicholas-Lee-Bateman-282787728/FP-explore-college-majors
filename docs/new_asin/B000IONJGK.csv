8147179,3,B000IONJGK,"Actually saw these videos in the bargain bin at Zeller's in Vancouver, BC of all places.  Picked them up for $1.00 each as a curiosity factor more than anything.  Overall, I did get to learn more than what I had known about the schools of the Northeast prior to watching this DVD, but at times, they are definitely annoying.  The producers of all of these (yes, I bought ""The West"", ""The Ivy League"", ""The South"" and ""The Midwest"" as well) DVD's try to put a ""hip spin"" on the commentary and analysis of the each of the schools profiled.  What it entails however is a predominant use of the words ""like"", ""you know"" and the odd ""ghetto slang"" to describe institutions of higher learning.  As a result, it loses a bit of credibility when it starts to sound as if the person doing the commentary for a respected four-year institution barely got out of one of those ""9-month diploma mills"" that you see commercials for on the ""Jerry Springer"" show.  But if you can work through that bit of ""cringe factor"" while watching this DVD, then they are not bad . . provided you don't really spend more than $2.50 for them.",1357084800,,1111,4.475247524752476
8147180,3,B000IONJGK,"First the good news. It does an excellent job of covering a University in the space of 12 minutes. My daughter goes to one of these colleges and we were very impressed with the insight it provided in such a short amount of time.

Now the bad.

There was too much cutting....the video proceeds at a frantic pace, cutting from one scene to another, zooming in, zooming out. The camera is never held steady. The strobe effect could trigger seizures!

There was not enough cutting....too much precious time focussed on interviewing kids about the drinking, the partying, how sexy the girls are, how hot the boys are. It all starts sounding the same after a while...because it is! We all know that heavy drinking goes on at campuses everywhere....but do we need to hype it up so heavily to High School Juniors and Seniors? When you only have 12 minutes or so to describe a college, why interview some co-ed about whether the guys/girls are good-looking or not?

Answer:  Obviously pandering to teenagers.",1181692800,,999,4.7514450867052025
