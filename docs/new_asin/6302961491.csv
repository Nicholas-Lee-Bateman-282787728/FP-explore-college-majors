524935,5,6302961491,This movie should be viewed by everybody to remind us how far we've come and how far we still have to go.  I taught in the public school system and I showed this movie every year so that my students could have a greater  appreciation of what people in the past have done to fight for the right to  an education.  This movie has great actors who truly bring these heroes to  life for today's generations.  I would recommend this movie to everyone.,940291200,2,446,4.313253012048193

524979,5,6302961491,"I've been looking for this video for a LONG time, with no success. I had really given up finding it when I stumbled across this as a recommendation. I am talking to my children now about the civil rights movement and this movie puts you right there at one of its crucial moments. My kids liked it better than the usual history documentary I sit them in front of.  This is truly entertaining.",1419552000,2,391,4.3561643835616435
524980,5,6302961491,I am from Little Rock and actually was fortunate enough to be a paid extra in this movie. All the actors were great to work with. It is an excellent family movie and portrays the actual story almost perfectly.,1410739200,,209,4.384615384615385
524981,1,6302961491,I remember watching this movie every year during Black History month on Disney Channel while growing up and I loved this movie... Its a good story...,1260662400,,149,4.769230769230769
524982,5,6302961491,"The Little Rock Nine tryed in September 1957 to implement the Supreme Court decision of Brown vs. Board of Education. What follows was nine months of chaos, hatred, and courage that would forever change those involved, especially Ernest Green, the only senior. He would eventually become Assistant Secretary of Labor to Jimmy Carter. What he learned in that time was more valuable than any other experience he had. Hear him as he narrates the story, and see the obstacles he had to overcome. This movie also takes a look at the bigotry all nine students faced, and is a testiment to some of the lowest behavior the white race has ever participated in. It is also a testiment to the theory of non-violence in practice, and how one person's fight for what is right can truly make people question and change their beliefs. Excellent performance by Morris Chestnut as Ernie, Ossie Davis and Grandfather and Gary Grubbs as Mr. Lumas, Ernie's Physics teacher and Boys Counselor at Central. Every high schooler ought to be required to see it before graduation.",1088121600,17,1053,4.855555555555555
524983,5,6302961491,"An excellent and humbling movie.  It brings to life and brings home the awfulness of the day to day struggles the Little Rock 9, and all blacks, had to go through and the courage and strength of character they faced it with.  It is in a sense a sobering movie.  Although it does end on a definitely triumphant note, it is not a sugar-coated ""and they lived happily every after"" story. I believe that every child should be required to watch this in school at least once.  The history books give us facts, but it is excellent movies like this one that put names, faces, and emotions to our history and really make the story stick in your mind.  The Long Walk Home is another excellent movie I recommend in this category.",1011657600,8,718,4.409090909090909
524984,4,6302961491,"Wow!  What a must see for everyone during January and February with Dr. King's Birthday celebration and Black History month.  I teach in a public school and show it every year.  It is a powerful story of courage in the face of racial discrimination and utter hatred.  The movie is a heartfelt look at what those courageous teenagers did, so that my black students and white students could go to school together peacefully.  Young children do not realize the sacrifices made so that they could have equality today and this movie is an excellent look at what a mere 40 years can do to change a society, when there are people willing to stand up for what is right!",1010620800,12,661,4.5210084033613445

7832491,5,6302961491,"Incredibly I could not find this movie on DVD, which is the story of the Little Rock Nine, so I had no other choice but to buy it on VHS.  A little pricey for a VHS tape, but will use with my American History classes for years to come.  If you teach American History and haven't seen this, you should; the students attention to it shows it's worth it.  Would recommend this seller.  Thanks!",1501891200,2,390,4.22972972972973
7832492,5,6302961491,"I have used this video in my religious education class (I teach 8th graders) for years and needed a new copy.  It is a wonderful, powerful story that my students respond well to and learn much from.  This vendor delivered this copy very promptly and it is in great condition.  Thank you.",1488844800,,287,4.480769230769231

7832494,5,6302961491,"It took me 2 years to find a copy of this movie on VHS and another 2 to finally get a copy on DVD.  It has been worth every moment and every penny spent!  As a high school History teacher, I use this video when we talk about the Civil Rights Movement.  Since my students are the same age as the students in the movie, it really hits home for them.  Invariably, they are laughing, crying, cheering, shouting, etc. as the movie progresses.  One of the questions that I ask my students is, ""Do you think you could have done what those students (the Little Rock Nine) did?""  Their replies have been interesting and reveal a lot of self-examination taking place. I can honestly say that it's one of the best movies about the Little Rock Nine that I've ever seen; it is also the only one that was filmed entirely on the campus of Central High School in Little Rock.  I visited the Historical Site this past summer and was able to take a tour inside the school - it looks just the same as it did back then!  The sheer size and scope of the building is huge!  The building itself is about 2 city blocks long; picture the fact that Elizabeth Eckford was dropped off at one end of the school, and the bus stop that she ends up walking to alone was at the opposite end.  I can't say enough about how well done this movie is and how much of an impact it has had on my students over the past few years.  So worth the money if you can find it!  I know they have copies at the Visitor's Center at the Historical site!",1458259200,2,1502,4.141379310344828

7832496,5,6302961491,Bought it for my sister.. She loves it!! I'm going to order for myself soon I think. Morris Chestnut as a youngun playing Ernest didn't hurt none.,1438646400,,146,4.444444444444445
