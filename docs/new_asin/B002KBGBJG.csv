8371858,5,B002KBGBJG,"This is a fun series to watch especially around Halloween. Interesting ghost stories and filled with fun haunted facts! It's not HD quality and is from the early 2000's. Some (not all) have been burned on wrightable disks so they have generic sleeves as pictured (left) . Some have The original sleeve as pictured (right).All my disks have worked fine.
I wish History Channel still had documentaries like this. I have the entire collection and would recommend it!",1504569600,,463,4.948717948717949
