3588231,5,B001FQRIPS,"I've never seen a film like this, it's totally original. The plot isn't obvious and it reminds me of some sort of mix between David Lynch and David Cronenberg. It takes place in Baja California, Mexico and from the first line of the movie you know that the male lead is dead - although I felt unsure through the whole movie if you're watching something that takes place in the afterlife or in the normal world. But by the end of the movie I got it. In the last minute of the movie, I realized that the main character didn't understand what was going on either. Over the next few days I couldn't stop thinking about this movie and watched it a second time...it wasn't until I watched the movie again and the last scene finished that I realized that I really love this movie.",1231718400,,773,4.337931034482758
3588232,1,B001FQRIPS,"I was so appalled to see good ratings for this film I had to weigh in. I just finished CIRCULATION and it was the most mind-numbing, soul-bleaching experience I have had. If I could give it zero stars, I would.

It was worse than 30,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. That movie was just stupid. This one fries your brain with nothingness.

This is not a horror film. There is no thrill, little blood, a lot of stupidity and really dumb dialog. It doesn't even play with your head like a psychological thriller. It just... sits there and hypnotizes you with boredom.

There is no element that would make me want to watch it again and again. It was desert, an old truck, a guy who shoots cannibals who aren't even bloody and a woman whose destiny is to become a CATERPILLAR.

Comparing it to David Lynch is blaspheme. David Lynch would not even use a pseudonym for a film like this one.

I'm sure there are lofty themes of rebirth here, but I'm out for a good horror flick, not 88 minutes of my life I desperately wish I could get back.",1231459200,7,1027,4.328125
3588233,5,B001FQRIPS,"Circulation is a thought provoking, stimulating, resplendent film. I have seen the movie over a handful of times and everytime have discovered a new device the director uses to add to the intricacy of the plot line. Ryan Harper has done a superb job leading his audience into a journey of the afterlife, following Ana's delicate rebirth as a caterpillar to Gene's resurrection as a spider. Harper does an especially eloquent job presenting the viewer with an array of personalities that captivates and intrigues. A beautiful film with stunning cinematography and an excellent storyline, I encourage everyone to view this film or better yet, buy it to watch over and over!",1229644800,4,671,5.054054054054054
3588234,4,B001FQRIPS,"Saw Circulation at the Roxie in San Francisco earlier this year and plan to catch it again at a showing Dec 14th, in Fremont, CA [...]. Am hoping to pick up a signed copy there, but if not, will be ordering it from Amazon after. Makes me want to take a trip down to Baja and check things out. Great movie even if you're not into horror as it has a real plot too.",1228089600,4,362,3.9054054054054053
8302333,5,B001FQRIPS,"Charmingly Kung-Fu caper which suggests a Deadly Weapons era Doris Wishman on vacation at a seedy Manila hotel and reluctantly having to direct a film starring two Bruce Lee impersonators in order to get the money to fly back home. It features Jack Lee as a student of his more famous namesake who has been entrusted with 'the secret book written by Bruce Lee before his death'. Travelling to Manila in order to help out at a friend's Kung-Fu school, Lee runs foul of local gangster Miguel (played by a token Westerner) who wants the book at all costs, containing as it does Bruce's Kung-Fu. Great stuff",1525651200,,603,4.644859813084112

8302337,2,B001FQRIPS,"This might be a good movie to watch after you dropped a hit of acid? The director/writer were trying to meld the afterlife in hell with a parallel to the living in our world as we watched the metamorphosis of the two lead characters into a spider and a caterpillar /butterfly (only in mind and actions). Our characters may not know their current situation as the story starts and plays out as they meet after an accident on a road in Mexico  when Gene stops to pickup Ana. They are involved in altercations, arguments with each other as they try to figure out whats happening to them.
 I must say it took a while to figure out what this was about and after I did I liked the concept, but not the execution as it seemed to take way to long to develope with not much of a payoff at the end.
This was a bold attempt at trying something new and different from the standard thriller/horror genres (hats off for the giant leap) that flood the market,  but I felt it was a little to much for this teem to pull off effectively. The actors lacked direction and were left  on their own to fill in the blanks as it was visible on their faces as they ad-libbed their way along. The language barrier didn't help as there were long periods of silence (again, hats off for trying) that made the pacing drag here and there.
I would give this three stars except people might get the wrong idea that I liked the movie when I was only crediting the attempt at thinking outside the box on this project. So two stars for a not so good movie.

Ps; I watched this on youtube and saved the $1.99 albeit with poor image quality.",1411171200,,1603,4.259868421052632

8302340,1,B001FQRIPS,"UNwatchable!!!This isn't even a  B-movie...it's a Z movie! Im appalled that Amazon would rent/sell such  a low budget movie! Its not even worthy of 3am television! On top of that it's SLOW moving,boring and mostly in Spanish. Dont be misled by the synopsis like I was,it's not at all what you would expect ...This girl is going away to spend  a few hours with her boyfriend in a seaside hotel for  a romantic tryst but when she finally arrives there-after 2 car accidents & nearly being kidnapped by her jealous ex-husband- she discovers the hotel is abandonned,no bfriend in sight, nothing but  a couple of weird  ""growling""homeless guys, whom i presume are the zombies...Then we spend  long hours on the road with her going back in forth in cars,all the while being pursued by ex jealous husband...Believe me, very lame. Wish i hadnt wasted my $$$ on this..Im shocked that Amazon would even offer such  a low budget boring movie...And usually Im  a  big ""horror"" movie fan!",1405900800,2,975,4.7844311377245505
8302341,4,B001FQRIPS,"Disclaimer: I read the screenplay for this film before it was made, and I helped cast this film. But, oddly enough, I wasn't overly thrilled with the screenplay, and just tried to help pick the best actors for the project. However, once I saw the finished product, I was highly impressed by what writer-producer-director Harper pulled off. Circulation creates a kind of pleasantly heady netherworld akin to the afterlife of the film Wristcutters, except more sinister. The film is low budget, but Harper manages to not let that make the film fall into the trappings of too many well-meaning low budget films. The horror is more psychological and ambient than gory or overt, and Harper deftly manages to create something very unique under the sun, which is not an easy feat these days. I ribbed Harper that he should have utilized his lead actress's sexuality more, but his restraint is also admirable. I found myself drawn into Circulation's world and genuinely admiring of the film despite my bias and involvement in it. I urge you to see for yourself what you think.",1395532800,4,1068,4.873626373626373
8302342,5,B001FQRIPS,"This movie is a great, non-traditional desert-set thriller/horror movie about an abused woman who finds herself stranded in an eerie parallel world filled with creatures that have a taste for human flesh.

Really beautiful cinematography, two great leads and a puzzling, twisty, spiritual mystery.",1231804800,6,297,5.75
