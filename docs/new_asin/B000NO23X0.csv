2772435,5,B000NO23X0,"I love watching The Girls Next Door and I caught the episode of them making the workout dvd, as soon as it was over I went online and pre-ordered it. I got it today and tried it out. I'm a fit person who works out everyday so I didn't expect too much from it, but hey it's The Girls Next Door so I had to do it. The fifteen minutes with Holly was a nice toning workout to hit some of those difficult places. Then it came to Bridget and man I was sweating like you wouldn't believe by the end of that one. With Kendra, it was an awesome power workout at the end of the dvd. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a good time hitting some key places that everyone wants to look great. Great job Holly, Bridget and Kendra!",1179964800,37,731,3.979591836734694

2772443,2,B000NO23X0,"Rather disappointing, but eye candy is still there.  Don't even to try to imagine this as any serious workout potential.

2772445,1,B000NO23X0,I didn't break a sweat. Too short of a dvd workout. I guess the good thing about it is that it doesnt take much energy to do.,1391385600,,125,3.6666666666666665
2772446,4,B000NO23X0,"This workout is fun, but not for someone looking to really get in shape. It is a nice video if you just have a few minutes to squeeze in a workout or you are not that fit.",1389052800,,171,3.6486486486486487
2772447,5,B000NO23X0,this is the only workout dvd that I will ever use in my home because I've actually gotten results from it. This dvd really shows you how to tone your body in a short 15-45 minute workout in your own home. This workout dvd is amazing!,1385164800,2,233,4.086956521739131
2772448,3,B000NO23X0,"After seeing these girls on tv I was expecting more T & A. They are wearing typical workout clothes for the most part. One is wearing a camouflage outfit.  The exercise sessions appear as though they could be effective. Each of the three sessions is about 15 minutes long. It looks like low impact aerobic exercise movements with a dash of yoga included every now and then. Nothing too fancy.
I was wondering why they weren't working out in bikinis?",1371168000,,449,4.6125
2772449,2,B000NO23X0,"for anyone who liked the Girls Next Door DVDs, this is OK but the workouts are so-so, and the girls are never nude. So what's the point?",1369958400,2,136,4.074074074074074
2772450,3,B000NO23X0,The DVD holder was broken which caused the DVD to be scratched. The work out is OK but not what I expected. A very light work out but not something thats going to get you super toned.,1368057600,,183,3.972972972972973

Both my wife and my personal assistant have told me many times how much they enjoy working out to this video.
You straight guys will app;reciate it too....rather than seeing someone like R.Simmons doing his strut",1363910400,,283,4.568627450980392
2772453,5,B000NO23X0,"I really enjoy the Girls Next Door series, and bought this dvd because of it. I would see the episode where they were shooting it, and wanted to try the workout. After getting it from my public library, I was hookd. Holly's workout was the best for me, with Bridget's being next, and while Kendra's moves were good, I agree with others who said she just danced around most of the time. Not really helpful. However, I was sore for 2 days after Holly's section. And her workout was  only 15 minutes! Anyone who is busy like me (5 kids!), will like this dvd, because the workouts are quick and effective.",1362873600,,601,4.414414414414415
2772454,3,B000NO23X0,I read a few other reviews of this work out video.  I feel the opposite. those girls said kendra was boring. i found her the most fun and most energetic. i just did a whole lot more reps and speeded it up.  she always kicks my butt. i have her other dvd work out and it is really good.,1350432000,,285,3.8135593220338984
2772455,3,B000NO23X0,"I bought this Workout DVD thinking it would contain more excersizes & tips on how to be fit & look good because,well,playboy girls are supposed to be the most beautiful women ever,right?Well,these girls obviously have trainers or state of the art gym equipment when they lived at the Playboy Mansion. Holly's Express workout is the best one(she does a good job explaining each step and maintains a professional approach),Bridget's workout is a little scary(her smile NEVER goes away & some of her movements look like she's causing injury to herself or look just plain uncomfortable),Kendra's workout is a total joke,she doesn't take it seriously at all,she laughs the entire time & also seems to be under the influence of some sort of mind-altering substance :-/ There is also a short interview ""special feature"",it's not really ""special"",just Holly trying to sell you Playboy gym clothes.",1338508800,3,889,5.180555555555555
2772456,4,B000NO23X0,"It's a cute work out dvd for any girls next door fan. Easy work outs with holly, Briggettes mild & kendra hard. Fun work out.

2772457,5,B000NO23X0,"When I bought the Girls Next Door workout I thought it would be amusing, but I was surprised to find it kicks your butt. I figure the fact that I spend some time giggling during the workouts just burns even more calories.  I enjoy starting my day with the Holly workout, wakes you up and gets you all stretched out for the day ahead.",1286755200,,333,4.203125
2772458,1,B000NO23X0,"Honestly I was so excited about this workout but it was not worth it. I'm a big fan of the Firm workouts which make me sweat my butt off. These workouts were more for beginners. And honestly I think Kendra's was probably the best one. It definitely was the hardest. Overall, I probably would like the video if I was new at working out but it's not a very good workout at all. And the segments are way too short.",1283040000,,411,4.15

2772460,5,B000NO23X0,"If u luved ""Girls Next Door"" show then ull luv this dvd. Its very fun to work out to. Each girl has her own workout style. Bridget's section is definatelly the most challenging, but its not the most sweat producing vid i own. I put this on when i want a light workout for the day. Each girl has her own 15 minute section and talks to u like she's talking to her best friend. Overall its a fun, effective workout. I def recommend it.",1275955200,,432,4.094117647058823
2772461,5,B000NO23X0,"I have tons of work out dvds and none compare to this one! I love it! It totally kicks your butt. I'd have to say Holly & Bridgettes are my favorite work outs. They both are so fun but really work you out. And I love how you can tell that it kicks their butt too! LOL. I wasn't really impressed with Kendra's. I sometimes don't even do it because it's not really fun and I have never been into martial arts, but I have a friend who's into it so I guess it's just what your into.  I would totally recommened this dvd to anyone who wants a good work out!",1265846400,,552,3.9285714285714284

2772464,5,B000NO23X0,So I have been doing the work out vido about a week and omg Im feeling it. Im used to doing little or no excersie and this is an awsome work out Bridgets is the most intense followed by Hollys then Kendras. Kadenas was one bid dissapoinment at the beggining she starts dancing doesnt explain whats shes doing which was one big waste and just overalls hers did nothing for me I got more entertainment from the birds in the background. Overall I give it 5 stars I recom.,1233446400,4,468,4.269662921348314
2772465,3,B000NO23X0,"This is an overall good DVD.  It doesn't wow you by any means but the moves seem to work.  I really liked Bridgett's section.  Some of the moves I hadn't done before and I liked how they worked.  This is not an advanced workout, but I like to do it on days I don't want to sweat a lot.",1231718400,4,285,3.7796610169491527
2772466,4,B000NO23X0,"I bought this DVD because I had been doing Holly's workout on demand from my cable company, and I really liked it!  I'm not sure if you would get results if this was your only form of exercise, but I go running, do crunches, and then do Holly's workout, and I seriously see results!  I also like Bridget's workout, but it's a little bit harder.  I was expecting Kendra's to be the best, because she seems to be the sportiest and the most in shape...but it's not that great.  The first couple minutes are all her dancing around and then there's some kickboxing and stuff, and I just couldn't get into it.  All in all, it's a good DVD if you're looking for a quick workout to add on to your daily routine!",1226880000,4,703,4.2556390977443606
2772467,5,B000NO23X0,"So I love the Girls Next Door aside from this workout, and they do a really good workout routine. Holly's workout is my favorite of the three. I wasn't really convinced that this video would be much more of a warm up, but it actually is good cardio, stretching, and toning.  I always break a sweat. Plus, if you love these three girls then you will be entertained while working out because you know their crazy personalities.",1226361600,,425,4.51948051948052
2772468,5,B000NO23X0,"This workout is perfect for the lady with not very much time!
I rock it out to these for a little while after I go to the gym and get my cardio in and i'm toning up beautifully!",1222732800,4,177,3.6842105263157894
2772469,5,B000NO23X0,"I love this workout video & it's worth every penny. They have a light workout (Holly), middle of the road workout (Brigette), and cardio workout (Kendra). I used to have an extra row of fat under my butt cheeks & doing Brigette's bun routine got rid of it after a few months! In order for the routines to be effective you must do them at least 4-5 times/week but they don't get old and they're not super tiring. I've had this DVD for several months now & it's still my fav. exercise video.",1221436800,4,489,4.268817204301075
2772470,3,B000NO23X0,"I love the show BUT this is FAR, FAR from a real workout. Holly and Bridget's workouts are good for days when I just don't feel like getting any cardio done. If you're JUST doing these videos, I mean, it's better than nothing but you have to get in your cardio too. As for Kendra's workout....WTF? Her dancing for 2 minutes was just stupid and awkward.",1218931200,5,352,4.348484848484849
2772471,5,B000NO23X0,"I lost a lot of weight doing at least one, usually two, of the girl's workouts everyday.

Holly's is definitely one for people who don't have much time. Usually I would do this if I felt rushed during the day. It's not hard, but it's effective, and I've carried over the techniques with me to the gym.

Bridget's is the hardest, the one I look the least forward to. She's very encouraging though, and you can feel it working.

Kendra's is a little short--probably adds up to 8 minutes, and it's boring. I would do it twice for good cardio.

Anyway, this is the only workout DVD I've ever stuck to that's proven results. I only cut calories back 300 a day and was getting compliments within 2 weeks. Definitely worth it...if you'll stick to it.",1217203200,3,743,4.4411764705882355
2772472,4,B000NO23X0,"Some routines are repeated, but still good. I was just a tad sore after I got out of my bed, especially my hamstrings and glutes.
Holly and Bridget had great routines. I was disappointed that Kendra's segment was a little less than 10 minutes, BUT her enthusiasm at working out and her tight abs motivates you to work out even harder.
There should have been more segments on working out your upper body strength.
Overall, it was a decent workout and it should have you sweating.",1216425600,,478,4.569767441860465
2772473,5,B000NO23X0,I never thought I would enjoy a girls next door dvd but I do! I got to workout with it for free and I like Kendra's routine the best because you don't need any equipment to get in to the routine. For the other two girls you do. My only complaint is that the girls shorts are way too short!,1211932800,3,289,3.8333333333333335
2772474,4,B000NO23X0,Bridget and Holly's workouts were surprisingly challenging. I was disappointed with Kendra's however. She starts off with a dance (which she does not even attempt to teach to the audience).,1211673600,3,189,5.333333333333333
2772475,3,B000NO23X0,The only reason this video received three stars is because I was sore for two days after doing the whole tape. The Girls go way to fast and no breathing technique what so ever. Kendra's workout would have been awesome if she would slow down!! Maybe I'm too slow. This video was extremly amatur. It completely lacked. BUT I now own it so I'll be doing it again and again and again.,1205798400,6,380,4.291666666666667
2772476,5,B000NO23X0,This is a great DVD. I love the girls and it just adds to how cool they are.,1203897600,2,76,3.2777777777777777
2772477,4,B000NO23X0,"I got this DVD because I love the girls, but once I went through the routines, I loved the girls even more for coming up with a great, enjoyable workout DVD!  I can definitely feel the burn in Bridget's boot camp, and use Holly's at night before I go to bed.  Kendra's routine isn't really my style, but it was still effective.",1203465600,,327,4.258064516129032
2772478,4,B000NO23X0,"I love the Girls Next Door, but when this DVD was given to me as a gift, I didn't really think that there would be much to the work outs. I was wrong!

2772479,4,B000NO23X0,The video was a pretty good workout for a beginer.  I wouldn't recommend it for someone more advanced.  I didn't even break a sweat until it was almost over.  It was fun and motivational though!,1202169600,,194,4.485714285714286

We've been big fans of these girls since they were first introduced in Season One of The Girls Next Door Girls Of The Playboy Mansion in some countries.)

My partner and I looked forward to the videos and we were not disappointed with this one. It's great fun and shows a much more personal kind of workout to the usual run-of-the-mill stuff that celeb's put out. We especially liked Bridget's portion of the DVD, she really seems to engage people at a personal level, even though she obviously can't see her audience. Bridget seems to share herself at a more intimate level with the viewers.

This is not to say that Holly and Kendra aren't just as much fun in their own ways. Kendra really puts the ouch on and Holly is, well, Holly-esque as always . These three are easily the most fun trainers we have seen.

We recommend this DVD to everyone who needs the workout (3 different styles) and who loves the Girls of The Mansion.

2772481,4,B000NO23X0,"This workout viedo was really fun and a great workout too! I really liked Bridget's bootcamp section, I never thought that a fifteen minute workout could make me so sore! I would definitly recommend this video to a friend.",1200614400,3,222,4.717948717948718
2772482,4,B000NO23X0,"This dvd is good  for those who have little time to workout. Both Holly and Bridget's sections of this dvd had tried and true effective exercises. Those segment's were 15 mintue's each and thier banter during the exercise was cute and entertaining. They effectivly explained how to do the exercise right. Let's get to Kendra's section which frankly sucked. Yes I realized this is a dvd made by skinny playmate's but I had no need to see Kendra dance and that took away from the workout time. Her kickboxing moves were good and effective for the most part but the cardio segment was about 3 mintues, you would have to repeat it over and over to get a real cardio workout. The move where she squats and kicks is the best one and if you watch this segment a few times and learn the moves your better off turning off the dvd and doing them on your own for as long as needed. The main reson I bought this was because thier tv show is cute and funny and that carried to the dvd. Another reason for purchase is there is nothing more motivating to me than watching a Playboy Bunny exercise. Overall this dvd is good if you skip Kendra's section.",1199923200,4,1137,4.363207547169812
2772483,5,B000NO23X0,"I found the workouts on my cable 'on demand' channel, last night flipping channels with my fiance.  I found that in doing Holly's workout this morning I feel motivated and energized.  Holly's workout is really the only worthwhile one in the group, and I would purchase this DVD solely for Holly's workout. Kendra's is a joke, no offense, but it was literally laughable watching her gyrate for 5 minutes by herself, and though the Boot Camp workout is okay, it seems like a 'final' in PE class, in junior high.",1199145600,2,509,4.644444444444445
2772484,3,B000NO23X0,"I was expecting less than I got from this DVD. I am a big fan of the Girls Next Door series so I bought this DVD to complete my collection but now I am actually using it. The production and presentation of the DVD is pretty budget but the contents are useful.
Holly's workout is a convenient 15 minutes long and still effective.
I have some misgivings about Kendra's warmup as it appears to be amateur camera effects on her dancing around....but the workout is not too bad.
Anyone who is a fan of Girls Next Door looking for a laugh or a friend to workout with should get this DVD.",1198972800,6,581,4.243243243243243
2772485,4,B000NO23X0,"Usually, when I buy a new exercise DVD, I pop it in just to watch so I will know what to expect when I actually beging exercising along with the video.  Holly's workout is fun and a *serious* workout considering the 15 minutr time limit.  She really utilizes her 15 minutes and suggests along the way that the viewer should do more reps when time permits.

Bridget's workout is muscle-wrenching but uncomfortable to watch at times.  Bridget seems very nervous and body consious (when she definitely shouldn't!) which makes the viewer nervous as well.  However, if you can get past that, the workout is excellent for cardio!

And, now, we come to Kendra.  I'm sorry, but I didn't even finish watching her segment.  Basically, it was a few minutes of rumpshaking on her part and bad club dancing moves accompanied by dizzying camera effects.  That's all I watched and I gave up out of boredom.

This is and excellent DVD for working women (and men, too, if they can stand watching these beautiful women exercise without drooling on their sneakers).  The workouts are short but utilize the time limit very well. If the ladies decide",1191110400,6,1129,4.7384615384615385

I did it 2 times a day until HDTV took the preview away, then i had to come to amazon and buy it!  I really love Bridget's workout, it targets your ""buns and gut"" and in 15 minutes you really don't have time to get bored and it truly is a great workout.  I love Hollys workout as well..it targets your buns and abs and also adds in a good arm workout (which you'll need weights for).  I have watched Kendra's 15 minute exercize but have yet to do it, pretty much just because I don't have enough cordination..and space, for all the kicks and turns and dancing she does!  Most days I will do Hollys exercize first and then follow it with Bridgets second, or I will do Bridgets 2 times in a row, depending on how my calfs are feeling from the day before!  I love this DVD because even if you are as busy as I am, we all have 15 minutes to spare and that quick 15 minutes will leave you feeling great!",1189900800,2,1044,4.038834951456311

Bridgette's boot camp was my favorite because I like that style of workout and I just think she's the nicest most appreciative of the three girls. Holly's was a good light workout, for days when you can't get motivated, she admits she hates to exercise too...Kendra's dance segment was a little strange, but the kickboxing was okay.  My husband and daughter almost died laughing when she started dancing though!",1189468800,4,479,5.050632911392405
2772497,4,B000NO23X0,"I love The Girls Next Door and the workout DVD is great!  The workouts are short 15 minute segments so even if you have little time during the day to workout if you squeeze one of these in you'll get an effective workout.  Holly's workout is probably my favorite because she talks to you a lot while doing the workout and you kind of forget you're working out.  They are really fun workouts too!  I definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for a good & fun workout, or is just a fan of the girls.",1188950400,4,510,4.173469387755102

Sure, they're a little plastic looking, and having slightly annoying voices, but that doesn't really matter.

2772500,4,B000NO23X0,"OK, I'm going to be honest--I originally got the DVD because I'm a fan of Girls Next Door & thought it looked like it would be a fun workout, based on the episode I saw where the girls were putting the video together. As it turns out, I was more than pleasantly surprised at how challenging the workouts actually were... though I was really disappointed with Kendra's, which really felt like a waste of time to me. Here's a break-down of each 15-minute workout:

Holly's 'Express' Workout:
By far my favorite on the DVD, Holly's routine is very user-friendly & leaves you feeling like you've been working out for a lot longer than the 15 minutes. Though it doesn't mention it on the packaging, you'll need weights and an exercise ball.

Bridget's 'Boot Camp' Workout:
No complaints here; I was sore the next day, though, that's for sure! Bridget takes the 'Boot Camp' theme seriously and leads a rigorous, total-body toning session in her 15 minutes; the only downside is that she seems really, really nervous & it comes across every once in awhile during her routine. You'll need a pair of weights for this workout.

Kendra's Martial Arts Demonstration:
Really, this workout isn't even worth bothering with. Think Tae-Bo, but really watered-down and with a blond ponytail, and you've got it. The first three minutes of her section are basically of her dancing, followed by 10 minutes or so of jump roping & a few martial arts moves (kicking, punching and shadow boxing) I didn't even break a sweat during this one.

Overall, a great DVD with charismatic, encouraging ""leaders"" for quick, fun toning--just skip Kendra's section and work through Holly & Bridget's for a heart-pumping 30 minute workout.",1184544000,121,1701,4.855172413793103
2772501,5,B000NO23X0,"I couldn't wait to receive this workout dvd.  I love the Girls Next Door and knew I'd love working out with them.  When it came, I had to watch it right away.  I did all three workouts and I was sweating like crazy.  They put their own personal touches on each of their segments and that make it twice as fun to do.(make that three times as fun!)",1183766400,2,346,4.044117647058823
2772502,4,B000NO23X0,I have a huge collection of excersize videos and dvds. I really enjoy this workout due to how it is broken up into 3 different 15 minute segments.  You can do them all or one or two in conjunction w/ another workout.  Two of the workouts are a mix of toning and ab workouts w/ some cardio while the third is pure cardio kickboxing style.  It is fun to follow the Playmates and listen to them talk about living at the Mansion while you get a good workout.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good easy to follow workout.,1182902400,6,530,4.166666666666667
2772503,4,B000NO23X0,I love this workout DVD! It kicked my butt. I was laughing and sweating for the whole thing. I was never bored or felt like I wanted to stop the video...which I usually do! I highly recommend this for anyone that needs a good motivater and a good laugh.,1181520000,30,253,4.183673469387755
2772504,4,B000NO23X0,"I really liked this workout DVD because it's kind of like watching an episode of the show, which I really enjoy.  The only thing I would say (reason why I didn't give it 5 stars) is that there is a little redundancy with Holly and Bridget's workouts.  Still great though!  I like this workout DVD because I know that I will do it more than once, unlike others I've tried in the past.  So, overall - a good workout and I would love to see more workouts in the future from the girls!",1180483200,11,481,4.139784946236559

motivation so that viewers are free to choose.  Meaning not a set of exercises from beginning to advanced.  Playboy Mansion certainly provides
a nice working environment.
In short, this video simultaneously gives physical training and entertainment.",1469664000,,394,5.32258064516129

Kendra's workout is a let down though,  I always skip that one.",1457395200,,324,3.791044776119403

I used to love watching The Girls Next Door. Kendra's workout is a bit of a joke. I only did Holly's and Bridget's. They are much more professional.
