3546180,5,B001E6JC26,"Whomever wrote that this set was missing orginal music obviously hasn't watched it. I've heard songs that were replaced in even the sydicated versions. In fact the usual Parmount disclamier ""music has been changed for this home entertainment version"". is nowhere to be seen.
 If there's anything missing here it's very, very minute.
  I've been jumping around as far the episodes go and from what I've seen this the one of the most complete sets yet. In the episode ""shot in the dark"" the scene where Mr. C offers Richie a lifesaver after the basketball game is here. That's largely been cut out of sydicated airings.
  As far the episodes if you're reading this you're probably already familiar with them! From what I recall this this season Happy Days was the #1 show on TV so there's plenty of classics here.",1228867200,25,811,4.723404255319149

It's as good as it always was, and full of all the warmth such nostalgic always brought. Escape for awhile to a simpler time!",1227830400,2,386,3.8987341772151898

3546183,5,B001E6JC26,"Written Before the Season Four Release Announcement:

Being a naive 8-year old in a late-30s body, I tend to forget the business aspect of releasing Happy Days seasons. I know it's about money. That said (if I'm not mistaken), Season Three ranked much, much higher in terms of sales on Amazon's ranking system than Seasons 1 and 2. I thought for sure Season Four would come along in quick fashion. It hasn't... and no explanation, anywhere.

I had the thrill of meeting Henry Winkler at a Hank Zipzer book signing in May (2008). He was as electric, and gracious, as everyone has said he is (although I think he was somewhat cautious around a delirious fan who was neither female or a kid). Whatever the case, one of his handlers (for lack of the right word) said he would not be signing Happy Days merchandise (so much for bringing my Season 1 along), and it got me wondering just what is going on behind the scenes (granted it might simply be for the reason Mr. Winkler was there for the purpose of his book). I also wonder if all of us who are die-hard fans who criticized the DVD releases for lack of obtaining music rights from original episodes, lack of any ""extras"", and occasional poor print quality have done a disservice to the whole thing. We can't have everything the way we'd like it, but if CBS/Paramount pulls the plug on this, we might never see Happy Days in a home-playable form again in our lifetimes (so, yes, I would take what I can get in this case!).

After watching Season Three, I had forgotten how funny the show was at that point (and wildly electric and live). There is a palpable energy that is unmistakable. Yes, the ""film"" effect of one-camera/no-audience Seasons 1 and 2 are admirable, but Season 3 is like watching Elvis on Ed Sullivan. Pandemonium. And, Season 4 is probably the last ""laugh-out-loud-funny"" season of all eleven. Don't get me wrong: HD had many layers, but some of the later seasons are heavy on sentiment (like a video Valium pill for the mind) and high 70s TV drama (who can forget a blind Fonzie shaking his fists at God while crying in a Brando-esque way, ""How could you do this to ME? I thought I was your favorite person.""). But, even as a little kid I remember thinking, ""HD that opens with Ron Howard's Richie in his blue high school letter jacket meant ""funny""; HD that opens with Ron Howard's red college jacket meant, well, cleaner and often more schlocky fun."" Season 4 is that classic ""high school senior"" season. No Fonzie black t-shirts here. Just edgy, often risque humor.

This was the height of Fonzie Mania before they felt the weight of little kids. Before episodes were built around Fonzie saying smoking wasn't cool, and eyeglasses were. Before the great Garry Marshall went all P.T. Barnum (""see the Amazing Fonzie Battle with the Woman of Catmandu!). ... Hey, it was the 70s. Everyone gets a free pass there.

I'm just pleading with Paramount (hell, anyone): tell us why the hold up? I'll buy five Season Tens (arguably the only really questionable season, whereas the final Season Eleven was brilliant, I think) if we can just get to the classic Season Four! Let's put it this way: Happy Days Season Four was the 1 show of ALL of American television in that 1976-1977 season (yes, above everything; MASH, All in the Family, you name it). And for great reason!

An answer, please. Somebody. Anybody! I'll be the guy trying to burn his 1984 Happy Days finale (""Passages"") to DVD in the hope the tape doesn't unravel after 24 years if you're looking for me.

Please keep it going CBS/Paramount and TV gods that be...

Written After the Season Four Announcement:

THANK YOU!!! CBS/PARAMOUNT is assuring Happy Days will keep rolling along!",1219536000,11,3708,4.640243902439025
3546184,5,B001E6JC26,"A great season that starts off with the ""Fonzie Loves Pinky"" three parter.  Originally it was shown as a two parter on ABC (the first two parts were combined into one hour show).  Pinky was supposed to become a regular charcter on Happy Days, but according to what I have heard Roz Kelly, the actress who played Pinky, did not get along with the rest of the cast.  Too bad.  But wait until season five.  Another Tuscadero comes along in season five that made more appearances than Pinky.  Of course I am talking about Leather, played by Suzi Quatro, a very real life singer who is still performing to this day.  Getting back to season four, we see Fonzie romancing Pinky and later getting his high school diploma.  There is also the episode in which Howard and Fonzie invent the Garbage Gulper, a precusor to the trash compactor.  And Al replaces Arnold as the proprietor of Arnolds.  Also, this is the season before Chachi came around and the Fonz jumped the shark.",1219363200,19,966,4.563953488372093

Shows all sides of teenagers during their high school years, some funny, some emotional, some sad, but always enjoyable to watch, even the ""suggestive"" scenes are done in good taste and within the realm of my high school years memories.  Another set of TV dramas that requires real acting, not relying  on computer graphics and ""tech"" stuff.  Music good, and the soloists in some of the episodes are first rate, and have become famous in their own right as well as some of the actors.  I have all the available seasons and will continue to buy the latest as they become available.  I think most of today's teenagers would enjoy these episodes.  When my grandkids from six to 12 years old were here, they wanted to watch them all, even though some of the humor was above them.  I highly recommend all the Happy Days seasons.",1408406400,,911,4.574074074074074

3546333,5,B001E6JC26,"Season 4 is a lot better than Season 1 (can't speak for 2 and 3 as I haven't seen them).  I'd read some reviews that condemned later seasons and praised the earlier stuff but I've now picked up seasons 1 and 4, and I guess it's all about your taste and what you come to the show for.  I'm not really interested in a show that gives ""a realist portrait of a 50s family..""  Seriously, I'd much rather laugh at the larger than life antics of cool's architype - Henry Winkler as ""the Fonz"".  And the Fonz was hilarious.  Winkler is an accomplished and versatile actor who played many different roles in his movie career - for movies don't miss ""The One and Only"".  Though his Happy Days days are what he's most remembered for.  The show isn't really trying to be 'realistic'.  The Fonz's cool is of near superhero status, so if you expect realism I guess seasons where the Fonz becomes central are not going to be your thing.  Whatever.

Anyway didn't Season 4 win awards or something?  I almost lost interest in the show after watching Season 1.  Fortunately I picked up Season 4 and my interest has once again revived.  Now we've yet to see a Season 5 put out on DVD and that's a real pity.",1296000000,3,1188,4.321266968325792

3546335,5,B001E6JC26,"For all of you who rightfully boycotted Seasons 2 and 3, you'll be happy to know there were no edits in this DVD set. I'm not complaining there were no extra's in here, save for the Anniversary show, which is mostly a flashback episode. This is the show at its peak, in my opinion. Of course, I liked the other seasons as much but it's the last time the show would be this great. Arthur ""The Fonz"" Fonzarelli the ""hood"" with a heart of gold (Henry Winkler) and Richie Cunningham the shy and slightly cocky nice guy (Ron Howard) are pretty much co-stars (it would revolve more around Fonzie later) and it worked. Each major cast member had a show revolving around them too- for Joanie (Richie's sweet but smart allecky sister played by Erin Moran), it would be ""They Shoot Fonzies, Don't They?"" and ""Joanie's Weird Boyfriend,"" for Potsie Webber, Richie's buddy (Anson Williams), it was ""Fonzie's Hero,"" for Marion (Richie's doting mother played by Marion Ross) it was ""Marion Rebels,"" for Howard (Richie's wise and slightly grumpy but still caring father played by Tom Bosley), it was ""Fonz-How Inc"" and for lovable prankster Ralph Malph (Donnie Most), it was ""Last Of The Big-Time Malphs."" And Arnold's has a new owner, Al (Al Molinaro), lovable chef. Howard wryly observes ""Arnold was cute [but] Al is humble and Italian!"" Anson Williams does a great job crooning in this season and Donnie Most even proves to have a good voice.

It all begins with the 3 part episode Fonzie Loves Pinky, which features Roz Kelly as a guest star (she looked good in those pink shorts and she was in her mid-30's at the time!). She was one of the most popular one-shot wonders in TV history and alas, though Fonzie did like her, he and Pinky weren't meant to be. However, they make a great team in the drag race (I'm glad Richie's announcement to break for a commercial wasn't edited- I told my wife ""When they 1st aired this episode, that really was a commercial break!""). This features one of my favorite episode ""AKA The Fonz"" which features hilariously tyranical Officer (then Sherriff) Kirk trying to take over Milwaukee and run the Fonz out of town (the anticlimatic scene where the townspeople show the Fonz their support is a scream! Go see it for yourself and snap your fingers along with the rest of them!). ""Richie Branches Out"" features Richie trying to meet his poster-girl crush. In ""The Time Capsule,"" Fonz, Richie and the gang get trapped in Howard's vault (Linda Goodfriend, who'd later play Richie's girlfriend, makes her debut, albiet as Kim, not Lori Beth). Potsie saves Fonzie's life in ""Fonzie's Hero"" and the Fonz promises him anything at all (though having Potsie around all the time makes him uncomfortable). In ""Marion Rebels,"" Howard takes his loving wife for granted one time too many (""Here's your salad, your vegetable, your MEAT!"") and Marion decides to get a job- at Arnold's! ""The Muckrakers"" features Richie getting a story in the school newspaper (he had me laughing in that janitor's disguise, especially dangling the greasy liver in Fonzie's face!). In ""The Physical,"" the gang including the Fonz are forced to report for a physical- Seargant Belcher, I mean Bechler is a scream (uh-oh! 10 pushups for me!). In ""They Shoot Fonzies, Don't They?,"" Fonzie agrees to be Joanie's partner in a dance marathon, though he had to walk his motorcycle 12 miles to make it, Ralph becomes a bookie in ""Last Of The Bigtime Malphs"" and doesn't have the money to pay back one tough winner and Richie, Potsie, Ralph and the Fonz all graduate in the 2 part ""The Graduation,"" Part 1 ends in a twist after the prom and part 2 has the Fonz participating in the ceremony, with the others hurrying up (Potsie rushes through the ""Hail Jefferson"" song much like the guy from FedEx ads!) so the Fonz can give a surprise speech! This also features Fonzie's kid cousin Spike and Arnold (Pat Morita). Too bad they didn't bring back Richie's older brother for this special moment, but Chuck failed to exist after the 2nd season. In ""A Place Of His Own,"" Richie borrows Fonzie's room so he can impress a sweet but adventurous art student (""I found my thriiiilll on Blueberry Hill!""). And in A Shot In The Dark, Richie gets a lucky shot on the basketball team and is expected to save the next game (no doubt Chuck would be proud!). The Fonz finds old time religion in ""Fonzie's Baptism"" and this episode also reveals Arthur's middle name.

So find your thrill on Blueberry Hill and get this DVD set- aaaaayyyyyy!",1286323200,7,4500,4.716645489199491
3546367,5,B001E6JC26,I have always enjoyed watching Happy Days.  The shows brought back memories of happier days when I was younger.,1284249600,,111,4.842105263157895
3546368,3,B001E6JC26,"I loved the first two seasons of Happy Days and I am ashamed to admit I watched the show until season 5 or so as a kid. The first season DVD was intact, but the studio decided to cheap out on season two and alter the original music, theme song and the picture and sound quality went from OK to really bad in some episodes. When season three was released the music was intact, but they used edited versions of some of the episodes and the picture and sound quality vary throughout the season. Finally on the season four release, it appears that the music and the episodes are intact, but after season two the show just got worse every year. After season two the studio decided to go to a live audience and put Fonzie front and center. This not only changed the feel of the program, it also made it extremely juvenile and corny!

I know there are a lot of fans of this show, but really after season two there are only a few small bright spots in the rest of the entire run. It is no wonder Ron Howard wanted to leave after season two as it was embarrassingly bad for a guy who was part of one of the greatest sitcoms in the history of television 'The Andy Griffith Show' and the first two years of 'Happy Days' which I would consider classic television also.

It's sad to think that season two will probably never get a proper DVD release while this truly inferior season gets a decent release!",1266883200,6,1392,4.268939393939394

3546375,5,B001E6JC26,"Richie and the gang near graduation in this fourth season, which also centers more prominently upon the Fonz than ever before. (The season opens with a three-part episode, ""Fonzie Loves Pinky,"" in which the Fonz reunites with an old girlfriend in hopes of winning a demolition derby -- with disastrous results.)

There's also ""Time Capsule,"" where the gang is accidentally locked in Mr. Cunningham's hardware store vault with their dates while working on a school project; and ""They Shoot Fonzies, Don't They?"" where the Fonz promises to accompany Joanie in a dance marathon -- never anticipating he'd have to push his broken motorcycle 12 miles home just before the event.

Other episodes touch upon issues that will become more prominent in sitcoms of future decades, such as ""Marion Rebels,"" where Mrs. Cunningham tires of being a housewife and -- against the wishes of her family -- decides to get a job.

Fans of Anson Williams' singing voice are in for a treat, as Potsie makes a number of full-length musical debuts.

This box set also includes a special feature, ""Third Anniversary Show,"" with clips from the series.

If you want lots of laughs from a bygone era when life was a bit simpler, be sure to pick up this series -- Richie, Potsie, Ralph, Joanie, the Fonz and the rest of the gang are sure to give you a lift!",1232841600,15,1327,4.752173913043478
