5761688,3,B00CZ15G7Y,"I like to say I'm a big fan of Troma movies, but the truth is, I really only care about Kaufman's oeuvre. I've seen all of his films, and even found something to enjoy in his lesser productions. I went to the sparsely-attended Denver premiere of ""Poultrygeist,"" even though I'd seen it twice already and couldn't be as drunk as I like to be for Troma fare. I've even read his books on filmmaking, even though I don't have any aspirations to be a filmmaker (they're hilarious and chock full of good advice, by the way.)

The reason I don't care to look into other Troma movies is that, by and large, I'm sure they're terrible. Low-budget films suffer from a menage of deleterious issues: poor lighting, awful sound, incoherent scripts, etc. These problems can utterly ruin an otherwise decent movie, or concept at least. Uncle Lloyd, however, is an experienced filmmaker. It really is quite incredible what he can do with such a low budget, and the meticulous detail he maintains in his work shows up on the film. If you're paying attention, at least.

Going into a Troma film, I expect ludicrous amounts of gore, outrageous (if a bit dated) political incorrectness, and actors that probably didn't aspire to Julliard. What I don't expect is a meandering script that falls apart in the last act, leaving a full third or more of a movie that just becomes a slog. Return to Nuke 'Em High 1, Vol. 1 isn't that exactly, but its unique status in Kaufman's filmography does have certain effects.

Volume 2 of this film isn't going to be a sequel; it's going to be the end of the movie. And everyone knows that the gore, shlock, genital fest that is the climax of a Troma film is by far the best and most memorable part. Lloyd-o does give us some good scenes of blood and butts (often at the same time) throughout this film, but none of it compares to the Act 3 stuff in his last two efforts. Moreover, Kaufman's films have only gotten more and more outrageous as audiences become more desensitized, meaning RtNEH should be quite the show.

The film itself is well-shot, well-acted, and worthy of its Troma banner. What it lacks is a sense of tension building from scene to scene, as well as a strong editor. I'm not actually sure how much of this is due to ineptitude, and how much is due to it being half a movie. But it's a problem that makes the last half hour sort of confusing, boring, and seemingly unnecessary. Just start killing each other already, kids!

Apparently, this multi-volume idea was proposed by Quentin Tarantino, who suggested it to Kaufman, since Tarantino did the same for Kill Bill. Yes, Tarantino uses himself and his own movies as paradigms of film-making advice, which should surprise no one. Still, Qrazy Quentin surely gave audiences some sense of seeing two complete, semi-independent movies. A filmgoer could leave Kill Bill Vol. 1 feeling both satisfied and eager to see how Volume 2 ends. Return to Nuke 'Em High just sort of trails off (light spoilers here) in the middle of a Carrie reference, with the other protagonist in the perilous clutches of... the principal's office. Yes, that's the epic cliffhanger in this film. Apparently Lloydy just said ""stop at the hour and a half mark and send it off for pressing."" Sheesh.

Had I known this was what I was getting, I may have interpreted the film a bit differently, or just waited until Volume 2 came out. I don't feel a huge sense of excitement to see how this is going to end. I just know that Volume 2 is going to have way more of the stuff Troma fans are interested in, whereas Volume 1 is an unnecessarily long introduction with a lot of characters and threads that I doubt will be resolved satisfactorily in Volume 2. I'm even a bit concerned a lot of these characters aren't going to die interesting deaths; there's very little killing in Volume 1, which is a shame.

At the same time, it's tough to pine for a 3 hour Troma film. Even hardcore fans would surely get a bit bored of a 2 hour film of this nature. Given what I watched in this film though, it seems like Lloyd could've pared it down substantially, taking out some of the more plodding scenes and putting out a taut, rollicking film that would ignite a mainstream praise similar to what Poultrygeist got.

One final note here. You'd think that a film split into two parts wouldn't have to rely on text narration to keep the audience up to speed on what's going on. A high school gets infested with nuclear waste, leading everyone to start acting like crazy weirdos. We don't need every character to have a backstory explained to us. Similarly, the text narrator comes up to give exposition several times, which is just pathetic. Was there not ample time for clear transition scenes instead? I think Lloyd knows he kind of dropped the ball here.

I've spent most of this review talking about this volume 1/volume 2 problem, because it really was the main thing that irritated me. Make no mistake though: there are the requisite amount of tits, gore, props, and makeup that you expect from a flagship Troma production. But it's paced out rather poorly, and more importantly, Volume 2 is going to have way, WAY more, making this one nothing but a bit of a tease.",1399161600,2,5207,4.578326180257511
5761689,5,B00CZ15G7Y,"I demand a refund! This isn't a post-apocalyptic sequel to High School Musical like I was led to believe? Where's Zac Efron?

Dammit! I knew that I should've ordered ""Grease"" with John Travolta and Olivia Newton John instead!!

I can't wait for volume 2 to come out so that I can buy that and demand a refund for it too.",1398643200,8,320,4.316666666666666
5761690,3,B00CZ15G7Y,"I don't know what to make of this movie. It was bad. REALLY really bad. So bad, in fact, that it seems rather impossible to think it wasn't intentional. Yes, I know Troma films are supposed to be stupid, low budget, and have bad acting. But I am not a huge fan of the company. So I'll have to judge this as an ""outsider.""

The movie itself barely has a plot. I know of the original Nuke Em High, but what the hell is even going on, here? I'd say a ten year old wrote this, but that'd be horribly offensive to ten year olds. Not to mention, all the distasteful, sometimes 'turn away from the screen' gross-out porn-horror scenes in the movie. One of which, starts right at the opening as a mutant tentacle creature attacks a couple of teens in their genital regions while they have sex nude. Yeah. Its *that* kind of movie.

The problem here is, unlike other stupid movies, there's never a break from the absurdity or ridiculousness. There's never any serious moments or plot points to give you a break from the sheer stupidity and Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber jokes. Its almost like a Friedberg and Seltzer movie, but even *they* have breaks inbetween the lame pop culture jabs and parodies. Here, its literally non-stop stupidity and fart jokes. Not ONE moment of seriousness to drive the plot forward. That's what makes it, well... ""too stupid.""

Besides that, there's also the super-raunchy and filthy sex jokes. More than one of them include green toxic menstrual cycles. Then there's the two lead characters, nice ""rich girl"" Lauren and poor, aggressive Hispanic girl Chrissy. Both are lesbians who go from enemies, to fremenies, to lovers. But when they get mutated, Chrissy grows a giant penis and Lauren grows a mutant baby, and the ability to spray poisonous acid from her lactating breasts. Again. Its on *that* level of stupidity. As I said, if there was any moments of non-stupidity or even brief seriousness in the movie, it MIGHT have worked.

Worst part of all is, this is just Part One! The movie really doesn't offer much (or any) story. The dorky losers of the Glee Club get mutated into the powerful and violent Cretins. The Cretins then pull a mean prank on Lauren by stuffing her pet duck in her mouth. Then, Chrissy and Lauren become powerful mutants (with the sex joke appendages) and get revenge on the Cretins. Then, the Cretins start a fire at a house party. Then, Chrissy and the female Cretin get into a mutant fight at school. That's literally all of the plot and story within this movie. The rest is just one bad fart or dick joke after the other, with the occasional lewd gross-out sex scene or pop culture reference, such as jokes on school shootings or a parody of ""Glee."" I am far from thin-skinned, so even the school/movie theater shooting references didn't bother me (yes, there are actually TWO jokes about mass shootings in this film). However, if you're going to go there, they should at least be FUNNY controversial jokes. Don't just do it for the sake of offending the easily-offended, which is what it felt like more than anything else.

I dunno. Maybe I am just WAAAAAY too smart for this movie. Maybe I am too sober and need to take a large amount of drugs and/or alcohol in order to enjoy this. As I said, it's literally non-stop stupidity, way too over-the-top, tries way too hard to be ""funny,"" and when the jokes fail, they just throw in something controversial or lewd and disgusting, usually involving female anatomy. But if all this sounds like fun to you, then by all means, go ahead.

I can't rate this too low, because I simply think I'm just not the audience for this. I don't ""get it."" Its SO ridiculously bad and stupid, that it has to be intentional, and I guess, I'm just missing that part of it. I mean, I loved ""Troll 2"" and ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and the latter two weren't even *trying* to be intentionally bad. So if Lloyd Kaufman was trying to make the worst movie he possibly could for an audience that loves over-the-top horrendous movies, then mission accomplished. Again, I simply must be too out-of-the-loop to ""appreciate"" it.",1397347200,3,4133,4.601085481682497

Or maybe you went to a Con, paid parking, got a room, paid admission, just for some crappy VHS copy of some Troma junk? Well figure it out, Sally! You can get this stuffed in your cholesterol dripping mail box and watch this classic piece of troma-trash over and over for cheap! Crack open your money sack and grab a copy..this is classic Troma and YOU need to own it. Trust me, I didn't even have lunch on taco tuesday..it's just a great flick.",1396828800,3,508,4.3578947368421055
5761692,1,B00CZ15G7Y,"I was really excited when I heard there was going to be another Nuke `Em High movie! Unfortunately the excitement wore off about twenty minutes into watching the movie. I could tell immediately that this was going to be a lack luster dud. The movie was trying way too hard to be over the top, and shocking. I didn't feel like the movie had a natural flow, it all seemed forced. There were a lot of modern references that didn't seem necessary to the plot, that may have just been stuffed in so the younger audience could relate. If you love the original Class of Nuke `Em High and are expecting somthing remotely close to the same awesomeness...You might be let down. Usually I would keep my comments to myself, but there are too many good reviews for this sub par Troma release. Sorry Lloyd, Still love you! You've done amazing work, and nobody can take that away from you:) No offence to the cast and crew involved in the movie, just not my cup of tea. If your on The fence about watching it, Then you should! Maybe Im wrong.",1396742400,4,1027,4.382198952879581
5761693,5,B00CZ15G7Y,"Buckle your seat-belts, Troma fans!  The infamous Lloyd Kaufman is back with a new addition to the Troma family, and let me tell you:  its a blast!!  Chocked full of the low-budget / high-craziness fun that youve come to expect from Kaufmans empire, RETURN TO NUKE EM HIGH VOLUME 1 is beyond outrageous and a worthy follow-up to the original film, 1986s CLASS OF NUKE EM HIGH.  If you're any kind of fan of Kaufman or Troma, you will absolutely love this film!

I saw the original CLASS OF NUKE EM HIGH a long time ago, way back in 1988 or so, on VHS, and I loved it.  There was so much campy but well done gore and a zany storyline that kept me cringing as I laughed.  I knew from that point on that I was a Troma-fan.

RETURN TO NUKE EM HIGH VOLUME 1 is an epic return to those 80s-style films.  Kaufman has truly outdone himself with this one.  Watching this film made my mind drift back to those golden days, and I actually found myself in a state of euphoric nostalgia as the movie progressed.

The film is shot in the standard Troma-style: it looks good overall, but you can tell right away its a low-budget feature.  This is not a bad thing, either; in fact, its a testament to how well Kaufman can use a minuscule budget.  This is an art form that he has perfected over the years, and it is one of the reasons for his success.

The acting is pretty good, but the special effects win me over here.  Theres a ton of gore, and it all looks like high-budget stuff.  From melting bodies and faces to detached members to mutant ducks, theres a little bit of everything (literally) in this movieand it all looks great, especially when you consider the budget the crew had to work with.  I am particularly impressed with the melting body effects in the opening scene; gruesome and cringe-worthy, these could be in an Eli Roth film!

If you're not a fan of Troma films already, you might not enjoy RETURN TO NUKE EM HIGH VOLUME 1.  It is certainly not a film for everyone.  It is raunchy and darkly comedic, therefore some folks might be offended or put off by its tone.  But if you're willing to give it a look, I highly recommend doing so.  Troma is renowned for its uniqueness, and that is part of what draws fans like me.  The film is available now in a variety of formats, but be sure to check it out on Blu-ray; theres a bunch of behind-the-scenes Special Features that youll want to watch.",1395187200,3,2395,4.308724832214765
5761694,4,B00CZ15G7Y,"Class is back in session at Nuke 'Em High in the most explosive sequel we have seen in years! Lloyd Kaufman and the Troma Team bring us back to the glory days of 1980's cheese in their finest film since... well... CLASS OF NUKE 'EM HIGH! The Tromorganic food corporation has set up shop right behind everyone's favorite high school, but the industrial waste they call food is turning Tromaville's teens into a pack of radioactive Cretins! It is up to an embittered blogger and her class rival to join forces and stop the murderous mutants before the whole high school goes to hell. RETURN TO CLASS OF NUKE 'EM HIGH assembles a graduating class of over-the-top actors and actresses that spew the Troma spirit out of every pore. Unlike in so many of the company's more recent films, RETURN doesn't rely purely on shocking sexuality and offensive humor to enslave the audience (although it is certainly filled with both). There is an actual attempt to create an enjoyable, relevant storyline that is filled with off-the-wall characters first before smothering the screen in blood and other bodily fluids. As irreverent as the humor may be, RETURN delivers more sharp wit and clever satire than ever before, along with all of the same silly slapstick and disgusting gross-outs that Troma fans have come to expect from the series. On top of everything else, the special effects in the film have never looked better, with plenty of brain-splattering fun for all ages! This is a true return to form for Troma Entertainment, and the most fun we've had in years!",1394323200,3,1553,4.798507462686567

8587738,5,B00CZ15G7Y,"I'm not a massive Troma fan but, i respect and understand how important they are to the fans and other filmmakers

Return to Nuke 'em High Volume 1 surprised the hell out of me
It's a crazy over the top love letter to all things Troma and there 40 year history
It's also very unique and refreshing to actually watch a movie that moves at a proper pace while being enjoyable
Will you enjoy it if you never seen the previous Class of Nuke 'em High films?  absolutely yes
I only seen the original years ago
This film is a Re-make/Homage to the original trilogy
It's a black comedy/parody/horror/sci-fi hybrid
There are lots of over the top gags between the School principal who sound like Nixon, the late Lemmy from Motorhead is the President,
The Schools Coach is a Priest name  Sandusky  , there's a Blind Security Guard, a running gag about high school shooting
almost all the visual gags are slick and pay off
The film is also very honest about how High School is like lord of the flies
All the cast do a bang up job
This is without a doubt one of those films you have to view a few times to catch everything going on all around the surroundings
The film is not rated I guess in a sense it's uncut lots of nudity and over the top gross out scenes

Anchor Bay/Starz distributed this blu-ray something they hardly ever do unless it's The Walking Dead on blu ray
Which is shocking since Anchor Bay has gotten away from Cult, Horror/B-Movies over the years
This is one of there best ""exclusive"" BR since there first batch of classic horror films (Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, Halloween, etc.)
the disc has a lot of great extras
The two stand out extras are the audio commentaries
One with the cast and the second with writer,producer, director
Both commentary tracks are very interesting and enjoyable
The PQ is solid for the most part some scene do look a bit ""off"" due to using different equipment during re-shoots  (It's hardly noticeable though)
The audio on the other hand is a bit lack luster it's Ultra Stereo you get very little to any sound coming out of any side/back speakers
Which is a shame for a film with such kinetic energy going on
There always extras in the back ground making goofy comments

Anyone who loves Horror and Sci-Fi should check out this film
Troma is a sense the last real Indie film studio out there
Once you see this film you'll either become a fan or not understand ""There Brand""
But, how can you not enjoy a film with a pet duck, lesbians, a Glee club of Mutant Punks and practical effects
This is without a doubt my new favorite Troma film and I've seen a good amount of Troma films in the past  9/10",1472428800,2,2639,4.382413087934561

I love Eugene the machine, he is like the most testosterone drenched teen i,ve ever seen. The acters and actresses are all so good that i give credit to them all. This is horror comedy, but unlike mainstream films, troma films are all about kenetic energy.

8587744,2,B00CZ15G7Y,"It's been 27 years since the first NUKE 'EM HIGH movie was released by Troma and times have certainly changed since then. The same can't be said for Troma films. Once heralded as a company that prided itself on releasing some of the most unusual and controversial films of the time it's attempting to continue on with that tradition with this film. So many other companies have jumped on the bandwagon in that 27 year period doing the same thing that you wonder if they can achieve their goal. Leave it to Troma to pull out all the stops and go as far over the top as possible.

Taking place in the same New Jersey town all of their films take place in we once again have bad guys in the form of crooked politicians and big businessmen determined to make money and ignore public safety in doing so. When a batch of their toxic waste finds its way into the high school lunch menu things begin to happen.

The most notable is the transformation of the school nerds into the terror inducing gang called The Cretins. Wreaking havoc on everyone else in the school they do damage in minor and major form to anyone who crosses their path. That being said they aren't even the main focus of the film.

Instead we focus on two female students (names aren't really important are they in these movies?). One is a rough and tumble sort who doesn't take guff from anyone. The other is a rich girl who is used to getting her way. Of course opposites always attract and suddenly we have two girls in love with each other, a convenient way to show girl on girl simulated sex with plenty of gratuitous nudity. But what else would you expect from a Troma film? Eventually even these two fall prey to the toxic goo and change as well, with one eventually sprouting a 6 foot long penis about a foot in diameter that punches holes in people. Do I need to remind you yet again that this is a Troma film?

I would love to say that there is more story than that to find here but the truth is there isn't. It won't matter to Troma fans who think they can do no wrong. Others will wonder why they bothered to rent/buy this movie. Is it bad? Certainly. But that's been Troma's claim to fame for years now. Is it entertaining? It is for Troma fans but not much for anyone else. Is it worth renting? Not at all. For owning? Only for die hard Troma fans.

There was a time when I thought there was some originality to Troma movies, some things that while controversial made them at least fun to watch. The thing is once you get the joke it just isn't funny any more to watch it repeated over and over and over again. Fart jokes were funny when I was in elementary school (and there are plenty of those in this film too) but they just aren't funny any more. The same holds true for seeing this movie that seems to offer nothing new, be repeating old jokes once again and just becoming sad to watch. Add to that the fact that this movie is supposed to be two parts with each apparently stretched out for no reason other than to make it two parts and, well, it just isn't what it used to be. Perhaps it's time for Troma to start making something fresh rather than revisit old catalog titles.

Two stars here only because of the fond memories I have of Troma and because Troma fans will love this no matter what anyone says.",1409356800,3,3290,4.2898550724637685
