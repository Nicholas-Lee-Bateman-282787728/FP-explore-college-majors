1904011,5,B0000A9GLR,"So often our public heroes wind up having feet of clay ... but Fred Rogers was exactly the man that generations of children saw & loved on TV . This fine documentary not only gives us a look at the man himself, and the influences that shaped him, but also the many ways that he helped to shape the lives of others. Clearly intelligent & passionate about his work, what comes through most of all is his innate decency. The viewer never gets the sense that he's simply playing a part for TV, even away from the set of his show. No, you immediately know that this is the real man.

The documentary is valuable not only for providing its overview of & insights into Fred Rogers, but for the extras included on the DVD. While excerpts of various appearances are used in the main documentary, the complete appearances themselves are also provided. It's fascinating to see an early black-&-white TV profile of the man from beginning to end, both so that we can see everything for ourselves, and as an example of a time when TV profiles were simpler but had much more substance. There's no intrusive, mawkish music that occasionally overwhelms the dialogue, as with so many modern TV shows. And there are no quick cuts & jittery editing, either -- the profile simple lets the man talk at length. It's a real pleasure!

Interestingly enough, it's the adults who'll get the most out of this documentary. It offers a strong model of manhood that I wish many more would follow: no false bravado to conceal massive insecurities,  no crudeness or nastiness, but just a good man doing his best to live a worthwhile, giving life & leave the world a better place. Frankly, I don't see how anyone can improve on that. Most highly recommended!",1361491200,,1724,4.590909090909091
1904012,5,B0000A9GLR,"I ordered this for my sister for her birthday, and I was worried it wouldn't get to her in time. It actually arrived almost a full week early! And she loved it, says it is in perfect condition. Great transaction.",1325548800,,212,4.325
1904013,5,B0000A9GLR,"If you are a Mr. Roger's fan, you have to have this in your DVD collection.  Great story and behind the scene look at this show that has captured fans for generations.",1285632000,,167,4.21875
1904014,5,B0000A9GLR,"This is a great look at the life of television's most beloved personalities, Fred M. Rogers.

This wonderful documentary chronicles his life from infancy to his untimely death in 2003. The documentary is also narrated and hosted by former ""Neighborhood"" crew member, Michael Keaton.

We see Fred's transition from floor manager at NBC, to finally having his own show on WQED out of Pittsburgh. Mr. Rogers truly was a neighbor to us all, and this DVD is a testament to his influence on our culture. Enjoy!",1194393600,6,504,4.848837209302325
1904015,5,B0000A9GLR,"I found this very fascinating.  I always thought Fred Rogers was extraordinary, but never knew the full picture.  Thoroughly enjoyable way to find out about him and how he worked.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to know how to talk to kids or planning a program.",1140652800,10,272,4.625
1904016,4,B0000A9GLR,"This DVD was a great tribute to a truly inspirational man. I grew up watching 'Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood' and it still stands out as a genuinely unique program for children, in it's one-on-one sense of communication and the lessons the show taught.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the inexplicably extended interviews with Joan Rivers (of all people!) that followed some truly moving segments that talked about his lifetime achievements for his sincere mission to reach children with gentle compassion.",1135555200,6,526,5.116279069767442
1904017,5,B0000A9GLR,"I can still remember about 25 years ago throwing a huge temper tantrum, slamming my tiny hands hard against 70s-ish, tacky-looking, artificial wooden walls.  My outrage: I missed an episode of ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"".  And yet it was certainly not the response that would have pleased my idol.

Now I look back and smile, not only because it's a little funny, but also because after many years of being ""grown up"" and asserting my ""maturity"", I am once again on the Mister Rogers bandwagon, perhaps even more so than when I was a child.

No doubt, it began in 1998 when I read Tom Junod's extensive (but worthwhile) article about him in the November issue of ""Esquire"".  But this DVD has now put the icing on an already delicious cake.  My only wish is that there could have been an interview with Tom Junod, the writer who was at least partly responsible for re-introducing Mister Rogers to the current pop culture.

Mister Rogers was the word gentleness made flesh.  He was kind not only in front of the cameras, but even in his own private life.  He was in fact the real deal!  He was genuine with everyone regardless of age, economic position, or power.  He talked to congressmen, co-workers, Joan Rivers, small children, and you and me all alike.  He displayed a gentleness and genuiness that our world is not at all comfortable with and yet in dire need of, never more so than today.

I highly recommend this DVD to everyone.  Even if you hated the man (it's hard to believe, but there are such people out there), or you're a skeptic, or a mocker.  Mister Rogers could tame even the toughest audience, and if you're up to the challenge, you can see him do it over and over on this DVD.  And lastly, I recommend this DVD to anyone who is just aching to see something decent on their television screen.

God blessed us.",1114905600,53,1829,4.54434250764526
1904018,5,B0000A9GLR,"You know who is the best neighbor Mister Rogers is. Mister Rogers had a long and happy life. He died almost 2 years ago. If you want to know a nice and caring man,watch the following series Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. It is a show about Fred Rogers' teaching kids good things to do example peer pressure. Also you travel fun places like dance studios and other places. Also there is Neighborhood of make believe.that is what kids would like the most. With the puppets. If you have a child that is not happy and has a terrible life or needs to learn things to be a good influence make them watch watch the show. Thankyou Fred and god bless you

  Fred Rogers",1107043200,8,674,4.395161290322581
1904019,5,B0000A9GLR,"Unlike so many people with a religious background, Mister Rogers never threw his own religion around. Instead, he wanted kids (and adults) to always like themselves the way they are.

Mister Rogers knew that more could be accomplished in the world if people were emotionally/mentally built up instead of being told that they were not any good. This timeless lesson (along with his naturally caring personality) was what made Mister Rogers Neighborhood such a wildly popular show on PBS. According to the official program record, it was PBS's longest running show.

Even when Sesame Street and other PBS shows were trying to go for 'current' Mister Rogers refused to talk down to his audience. He was also radical in believing that children deserved respect and needed to be listened to.

Sure, Picture Picture went from filmstrips to videocassettes, but that was a technical change so Mr. Rogers could continue his show. A technical change was acceptable because it had not altered the time-honored formula established in the very first show.

This documentary is good for Mister Rogers Neighborhood fans, but it is also a good teaching tool. People wanting to go into broadcast production and/or early childhood education must be made aware of the critical difference between good material, the mediocre, and the absolutely horrible.",1102896000,39,1334,5.190697674418605
1904020,5,B0000A9GLR,"This is a wonderful and touching tribute to one of America'a true heros. It will be enjoyed by children and adults alike for many, many years.",1100044800,15,142,4.5
7996254,5,B0000A9GLR,"Mr. Rogers was a great man. This is the only footage of Paul and Pauline Purple, the purple people, that I could find. They are only on for a second but it was worth it since the rest of the documentary is so entertaining and informative. Tells you all about Mr Rogers. Little did I know that some of the puppets from the Neighborhood of Makebelieve were once on another black and white show! Great documentary!",1493596800,,411,4.421052631578948
7996255,5,B0000A9GLR,"To be able to see Fred Rogers not only in his Neighborhood, but also in the parts of his life outside the studio was so wonderful.  He was a man who so gently approached topics that frighten little children and helped them get through tough times.  I am so blessed that he came along at a time when I really needed his wisdom. Even mothers need a little help getting over the rough spots.  No one has yet written an owner's manual for babies or for young children.  I owe Fred more than I will ever be able to say.  And now he is in God's neighborhood, right where he belongs.",1472688000,,576,4.153153153153153
7996256,5,B0000A9GLR,"I love this documentary of Mr. Rogers. I first saw this on PBS back in 200x, I also like the special features too and I can't stop watching it. This DVD is great for those who want to learn more about him. I have great memories from this show. I didn't notice that the NET episodes not showing anymore.",1438646400,,302,4.135593220338983

7996258,5,B0000A9GLR,"Fantastic overview of Fred Rogers, filled with inspiration, and the genuine faith that made all of Fred M. Roger's life's work meaningful. If you view this DVD, which I can only hope the Fred Rogers Company, will reissue some day, you will understand why for him, the Neighborhood was a true calling, and why so much of television that our children know today is....well, no where near as beneficial as a half-hour used to be with Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. Highly recommend for parents and those who wish to understand what children's television can be in terms of a positive influence.",1432512000,,589,4.9
7996259,5,B0000A9GLR,"For anyone who grew up between 1968 and 2001, Fred Rogers and his ""Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood"" program provided a daily half-hour of guidance, education and entertainment for its young viewers. Following the passing of Rogers in early 2003, PBS paid tribute to one of its most enduring icons w/this 2-hour primetime special, hosted by actor Michael Keaton, who served on the MRN crew for much of the early 70s. You'll see:

- Clips of memorable moments from Rogers' program, (the very first show, appearances by the likes of Yo-Yo Ma and a young Wynton Marsalis, his visit w/a wheelchair-bound young man named Jeff Erlanger, etc.)
- An account of Rogers' childhood, as well as the backstory behind his decision to go into TV
- Commentary from such contemporaries as David ""Mr. McFeely"" Newell, ""Sesame Street"" creator Joan Ganz Cooney, TV critic Tom Shales, et al.
- Archival footage of Rogers discussing his life and career, as well as of his late colleagues Johnny Costa and Josie Carey
- Footage of Rogers' early TV endeavors, ""The Children's Corner"" and his mid-60s CBC series that served as the precursor to his later NET/PBS program
- Clips of notable milestones in Rogers' professional career (successfully testifying before the US Senate in 1969 to stop them from cutting public TV funding, being presented the Lifetime Achievement Emmy by actor Tim Robbins, his induction into the TV Academy Hall of Fame, and receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom)

In addition, several bonus features are included, such as clips of Rogers' appearances on ""The Tonight Show"" w/guest host Joan Rivers, his profile on the early NET documentary series ""Creative Person"", and full-length clips of his aforementioned milestone moments...it's a must-have for anyone who grew up watching Rogers' program and would like to see the impact both he and the series had on his audience, as well as the public in general.",1429315200,3,1904,5.041269841269841

7996262,5,B0000A9GLR,"In the absence of Fred Rogers and his fine television show on PBS, this two box set is the next best thing.  Even as an adult I found much to learn in his various episodes.  We were taken to see how things were made and had wonderful, imaginative adventures in The Land of Make Believe; as well as saw beautifully mounted Operas.  This set is a terrific way to bring back this great teacher into our homes.",1388620800,,406,4.246753246753247

Too bad this video isn't available digitally online somewhere, I think many more people would enjoy seeing it but most don't even know this video exists.",1373846400,,360,4.358208955223881
