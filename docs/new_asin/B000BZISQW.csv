2450233,1,B000BZISQW,This set is just a ripoff since the complete seasons will eventually be released.,1137801600,3,81,4.857142857142857
2450234,5,B000BZISQW,"These reviews are for reviewing the product. Not reviewing the people who review. Or how you spend all day watching The Simpsons and prefer the complete seasons. If you have $40,go out and buy the complete seasons. But for those who don't make much money probably video game testing,go out and buy Kiss & Tell or Bart wars for a quarter of the price. Spend a night @ home for an hour or so and watch a funny cartoon. These episodes are new to DVD so you people complaining they come out to slow,here you go. They're made to hold you over. It takes time to get every episode of every season on DVD,commentate on it,add special features. It takes time. Vol. 3 of Family Guy had 13 episodes on it. It came out winter 2005 and there's a Vol. 4 coming out in Spring 2006. It'll probably have 3 episodes on it. This DVD,Kiss & Tell will have 4,never-on-DVD,romantic and funny episodes. It will make a great present for anyone on Valentine's Day. But all the other reviewers wouldn't have anyone on Valentine's Day to give it to.",1136678400,5,1022,4.412698412698413
2450235,2,B000BZISQW,"Just like everyone else, I want atleast 4 seasons to come out a year, I will agree Simpsons Christmas 1 and 2 were great and so was the Simpsons Halloween. But these are just stupid. I mean if your going to make the single dvds atleast make more of the Simpsons Tree house of Horror dvds, they are way behind.",1134172800,6,309,4.166666666666667
2450236,1,B000BZISQW,"What is the point of these little ""hand pick"" episode DVDs. Its not like FOX wouldnt make enough money off of the box sets if they released them at a faster pase. Ok, the simpsons holiday DVDs have been good, but thats it. ""Gone Wild"",""Bart Wars"", and now ""Kiss and Tell"". I just feel like with the no doubt millions of Simpsons fans out there, FOX would be more interested in making bigger $$$ with the box sets than these single disk collections that retail around $10.00. WHY, WHY WHY!

WE WANT THE BOX SETS FASTER!!! (kinda like ""Futurama"" and ""Family Guy"") Thanks anyway FOX for not listening to your fans.",1134172800,4,611,4.504504504504505
2450237,1,B000BZISQW,"WARNING: READ THIS REVIEW SL O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O WLY!  Emphasize on the words in CAPS LOCK.

We Simpsons fans want the SEASONS.  Not the RANDOM PICK EPISODES on single disc DVDs.  We want regular SQUARE boxes that have the SEASONS.  Keep releasing them ALL; you still have NINE SEASONS to release (8-16).  Stop releasing the RANDOM EPISODES.  We want S  E  A  S  O  N  S  !  SEASONS 1-5 are great, Fox (thank you).  Please release the SEASONS faster.

8094857,3,B000BZISQW,"Kiss and Tell: The Story of Their Love is a single disc released around Valentine's Day in 2005. I noticed that there are a considerable number of reviews bashing the single disc releases, in which I can't understand. These sold well enough that Fox kept releasing them at the time. They were cheap enough for fans to buy or cheap enough to buy as a gift.

The Episodes are from the later seasons and consist of:

Natural Born Kissers

Large Marge

Three Gays of Condo

The Way We Weren't

The episodes all revolve around Homer and Marge's marriage. They can be fun to watch, but they are not my favorite episodes.",1347580800,2,614,4.486486486486487
8094858,1,B000BZISQW,"Wow, four of the most forgettable and regrettable episodes of the recent Simpsons. This show has been on a very noticeable slide since Season 9 and all this DVD does is prove that the show should have been canceled a while ago (keep in mind that this comes from somebody who owns all the box sets and peppers all of his everyday conversations with quotes from the golden years of the show).

I have no problem with the 4-show DVD's, I would just prefer GOOD episodes to be of those 4.",1139097600,14,484,4.318681318681318
8094859,4,B000BZISQW,"Here is a brief synopsis of each episode on this 4-episode release:

Natural Born Kissers (season 9)

Homer and Marge have trouble capturing their old magic in the bedroom and learn to get it back by adding a sense of danger to their love life. They begin ""snuggling"" in very public places in order to add excitement to their romance, but this quickly goes awry when they are caught on the miniature golf course.

Large Marge (season 14)

Lisa wins a bet with Homer on the Dewey/Truman presidential election of 1948 and gets to pick the day's father/daughter activity. Lisa chooses to assist with building houses for the homeless. Homer removes his wedding ring after getting paint on it and the usual confusion and mayhem ensues when Marge believes he is flirting with other women.

Three Gays of the Condo (season 14)

Homer and Marge argue when Homer finds out Marge married him because she was pregnant with Bart. He decides move in with Milhouse's dad. When that doesn't work out, he's eventually taken in by Karl, his former assistant. Karl has a flamboyant alternate lifestyle and Homer gets involved in it with the expected comedic results.

The Way We Weren't (season 15)

When Homer mentions that Marge was not his first kiss, the story flashes back to Homer in summer camp where his first kiss was with an anonymous girl who turns out to be Marge after all. In the flashback, Homer fails to show up for a planned meeting with her because he accidentally winds up in a fat camp, but all the years since that incident Marge believed she was stood up.

This collection of 4 episodes from seasons 9, 14, and 15 on the theme of romance should please any Simpsons fan who enjoys these single-disc releases. Although all these episodes will eventually be available on full season sets, if you can't wait for some of the later seasons to arrive or if you prefer less expensive ""best of"" collections then this disc is for you. Although the lack of extra features or more episodes on the disc is a negative, the price of the disc is relatively modest and most of the episodes are fairly good ones.",1138752000,26,2098,4.618279569892473
8094860,3,B000BZISQW,"I've written one or two reviews bashing these single-disc releases. Do they sell well? They must if FOX keeps churning them out. They're not complete idiots; if something's working (ie: making money), they keep at it.

Now we have this Homer/Marge relationship DVD with four more episodes to put on the shelf. One's great, one's good, the other two are average. Ho-hum. Average disc, hoo-rah.

My real problem with these DVDs is not like these other raving fans in that FOX is releasing these instead of the season sets. Relax, guys, we've got two seasons coming out a year. That's pretty damn good if you ask me. What I don't like is the tacked-on ""theme"" and selection of mediocore episodes. The Christmas 2 set had two episodes that had NOTHING to do with Christmas! Stop that nonsense. If you want to release these quick-buys, start a new line ""Simpsons Classics."" Search the myriad of fan sites and find the top 20 or so critically acclaimed episodes and release those on DVD. At least that looks like you put some thought into it.

In closing, you lunatic fans can just stop bombarding amazon with one-star reviews just because you're mad that FOX apparently is like some kind of bully on the schoolyard dangling future season DVDs over your heads. They're not that evil. They're not going to come out any faster with you complaining, so just review the DVD on its episodes. In this case, it's pretty average. End of story.",1138492800,10,1429,4.708
8094861,5,B000BZISQW,"If you don't like the product, then don't buy it. You're supposed to be reviewing the DVD or better yet, the episodes on the DVD. You're not supposed to be complaining about how FOX is trying to  screw people out of their money.

I have been a Simpson fan from the very first episode. And as a true Simpson fan I'm going to buy this DVD. Yes, we all love the Season box sets, but they are expensive. Some people just don't have that type of money and in all honesty I've bought all my DVDs on eBay for a lot cheaper.

Back to this DVD - personally I love the 4 episode DVDs. I really don't have the time or patience to sit and go through each DVD season and find a specific episode. That's why I completly love and enjoy these DVDs. All the episodes on the DVD have a common theme to it and their episodes taken from every season. You're  getting the classics and the newbies all on one DVD.

If you have a problem with the 4 episode DVDs, complain to FOX. Don't out of malaciousness give the DVD a bad review.",1138320000,7,1010,4.106598984771574
