8419530,2,B004A6N05M,It's not really a relaxation film.  It has some nice scenes - but it's missing the relaxation aspect.  Something is missing.,1363824000,,124,4.857142857142857
8419531,1,B004A6N05M,"I was so looking forward to this video.  What I got was very disappointing.  When finished I donated it to the public library so they could sell it for $1.  The videographer put it on a tripod which was not level.  When panning, the lakeshore on the left was slanted downward to the left - when it got to the middle of the pan, the lakeshore was lined up correctly, but when it got around to the right side of the pan the lakeshore was slanted to the right.  Much of the video was photographed too light, and was, therefore, washed out in color.  There was not adequate contrast in much of it either, so again, contributing to the washed out feeling.  I have other products from this same company which seem to be quite good, so this is just apparently one to avoid.  The music was almost nonexistent or kept repeating the same phrase over and over and over and over until you were sick of hearing it.  All in all the worst video I have ever seen.",1320624000,2,947,4.245810055865922
8419532,3,B004A6N05M,"The dvd Serenity Moments--Glacier National Park, I was not as thrilled with as the Alaskan & Candian dvd's...I am more familiar with Glacier Park, so I was expecting more...too much time was spent on the east side of the park, and not enough spent in the west & top of the park....alot of the park's major features were omitted...I understand this was not ment to be a tour guide of the park...I found the music to be very good as always, but the photography was lacking that ""punch"" for lack of a better term...I still found it to be relaxing, why I purchased it in the first place...Thank you",1313712000,,594,4.458715596330276
8419533,5,B004A6N05M,"I received this video as a gift and I couldn't be happier! This Blu-Ray video of the Glacier National Park is breathtaking! The video captures the serenity of the park's majestic mountains, rivers, waterfalls, streams and so much more! And the soundtrack is amazing. We were very impressed with how deeply relaxing and calming this video is after a long stressful day at work.  It is also a wonderful aid in helping us relax before going to sleep.  The clarity is sharp and crisp.  It is so beautiful, it makes me want to plan a trip there.  This virtual vacation to the Glacier National Park will leave you feeling totally relaxed, rejuvenated and at peace from your amazing experience with nature. I highly recommend this DVD to everyone!!!",1297382400,,742,4.7734375
8419534,5,B004A6N05M,"I got this as a Christmas gift since I own some of the other videos in this series.  I often put on some of the other Serenity videos when I'm trying to relax or when I'm trying to rest.  This particular video caught my interest because Glacier National Park is such a treasure----I've been there many times.

I like the video because it is without the distraction of someone talking nonstop.  The scenery has beautiful fall colors and a very relaxing soundtrack.  I can watch it and just soak up the scenery and the colors without a narrator explaining why its beautiful.  The music is the perfect match to the scenery.",1293926400,3,620,4.54054054054054
8419535,5,B004A6N05M,"I went to church today and as usual the hymns were beautiful. I came home and listened to this Rocky Mountains DVD which I received the other day. It is by far the best investment to one's soul. The music of this composer Johnathan Garcia is celestial beyond compare.  This DVD transports you to another place in time, and I write this through the tears as I am so overwhelmed by the majestic pulchritude of the scenery as well.  The people involved in the making of this should be scoring huge budget films, including the director.  I am in abject awe. I surmise it is only a matter of time before this happens.",1289692800,3,612,4.398230088495575
