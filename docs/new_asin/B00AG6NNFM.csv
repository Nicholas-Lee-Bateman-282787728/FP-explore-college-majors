8551282,2,B00AG6NNFM,"Delivery was quicker than expected--thank you, Amazon!  As to the movie itself--picture and sound quality are first rate but that's where the positives end.  The only reason I bought this movie was a personal fond memory of being a 7-year-old kid at the movies with Mom and Dad in 1950 and being thrilled by the 46 Ford convertible sailing down the hill--with Ida Lupino at the wheel and unable to stop or even slow it down because her mean husband tampered with the brakes--and crashing through a fence and into a lake.  That's the minute and a half or so of excitement that this movie will give you.  The rest is an improbable bore.  Stupid woman--socially prominent in her small town in the South where she has oodles of important friends and certainly on good terms with the local police--instead of going to her friends and/or the police, spends weeks ""hiding"" from her murderous husband--changing her hair color, running away to a neighboring state, taking a job as a waitress where she'll be likely recognized by the public because her picture is in newspapers (duh!) and she hyperventilates and gasps her way to the end of this silly piece of junk, finally being rescued ""just by a chance remark by a stranger.""  So if a 46 Ford falling into water strikes you as thrilling, get this movie.  Otherwise forget it.",1437177600,,1319,4.708695652173913

8551285,4,B00AG6NNFM,"Great film  Noir  very impressed with acting.  I liked the scheming, sultry Peggy Dow.  She is quite a looker in this movie.  Ida Lupino is no slouch, either.  If you're a fan of Noir. I highly recommend this movie  you won't be disappointed.",1419984000,6,242,4.488372093023256
8551286,4,B00AG6NNFM,"What might have passed as just another woman-in-peril film is nicely elevated by a strong and reliable cast headed by Ida Lupino, Howard Duff, and Stephen McNally.

A car with no brakes going over a North Carolina bridge into a river, a business acquisition using the oldest, and most effective, bargaining tool of all...murder, and some of the worst news a new bride could ever receive on her honeymoon all contribute to making Woman In Hiding a very enjoyable crime/noir film.",1402185600,6,478,4.901234567901234
