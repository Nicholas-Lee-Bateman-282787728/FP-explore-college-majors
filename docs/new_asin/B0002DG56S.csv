However the end was horrid,  I won't give away what happened, but they could have made it in such a way that a good moral against messing with humanity is made, instead of leaving lacklustre ambiguity.  The ending of a movie is supposed to be key, here it fails miserably,  If you still want to see it, I recomend watching it, not buying, this is not the kind of movie that you wish to see again and again, except maybe for the wonderful acting (especially by the kid, Adam)  Very good idea by the directors naming him, adam instead of another name.",1096675200,,763,4.345070422535211
8026752,1,B0002DG56S,If you are given the choice of watching this movie or having unnecessary root canal surgery; take the surgery.  This may very well be the worst movie ever made that actually has name actors (De Niro & Greg Kinnear),1094860800,,214,4.487179487179487
