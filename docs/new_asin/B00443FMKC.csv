4259934,5,B00443FMKC,The true story of the female mathematicians who were critical to the war effort during World War II.  Their skill saved countless Allied lives.  And yet they were snubbed when the reporters came around after the war was over.,1360022400,5,225,4.743589743589744
4259935,5,B00443FMKC,"I'm grateful to LeAnn for having made this film.  I wish they had done it decades ago, of course, when memories were better.  My mom was one of the ""computers"" at Penn.  She worked with the ENIAC computations and went to the Aberdeen Proving Ground.  I've heard this all my life.  Until maybe 15 years ago my mother could have recounted this blow by blow (down to Eckert and Mauchly or one of them--I don't' remember--spying on their lunches because he thought dessert made them do math slower (my mom loves dessert), and having them work through Thanksgiving with no heat.  My mom was VERY good at math, and started Penn at 16.  She graduated in 3 years with a degree in economics.  She is 88.  And she has always been VERY proud of having worked for the ENIAC project (it was the only job she ever had).  Her father picked her up every night and she couldn't tell him what they were doing. She watched the film, but she was very tired and slept through part of it.  Every once in a while she'd wake up, say ""it's Press Eckert"" or ""it's the ENIAC"" and was out again.  When I got my first computer (a MacPLus) mom wouldn't touch it, because she said she ""hates computers"".  When I asked why she said ""I hate the ENIAC.""  But that turned out to do more with things like lunch and the heat, not the actual computer.  Needless to say, my smiling Mac didn't look anything like what she thought a  computer ought to look like.  I think it would be good to compile a list of as many of the ""computers"" (the actual women) as possible.  So here it is, Shirley Spiers.",1354060800,15,1559,4.298969072164948
4259936,5,B00443FMKC,"I was working on a presentation for a computer club to honor women on Valentines Day. I was pretty much finished when I bought this DVD. It affirmed what I had done. It tells a story about the accomplishments of ""women as computers"" in WWII and after. They did not receive recognition for computing trajectory tables for the artillery of for the Norden bombsight. They received literally no recognition for programming ENIAC - the first computer. The presentation went over well. I credited the filmmaker and the author of the article that inspired me. I also stated the cost of the DVD was one of the best purchases I had ever made. Great true story.",1329264000,5,651,4.6695652173913045
4259937,4,B00443FMKC,"What a wonderful and long-overdue tribute to these incredibly important women of winning WWII!

The DVD suffers from careless editing, however. Discussing the Norden bombsight as important for hitting German tagets with the B-17, a B-29 mission over Japan was the visual in the background.  And yes, it IS an important distinction, especially in a history of this type.  And it is not J. Robert OH-penheimer, but J. Robert OPP-inheimer.  I have met him at Berkeley and have never heard his name pronunced in this way.  Nitpicking?  Perhaps just a little.  But the memory of these women deserves better editing than these glaring errors.",1311552000,2,636,5.0576923076923075

4259939,5,B00443FMKC,"Fascinating documentary about female mathematicians during World War II who worked as human ""computers"" to calculate ballistic trajectories, and later became the first electronic computer programmers.

4259941,3,B00443FMKC,"During WWII, the American military hired female math majors to work on equations that would help weapons be more effective.  This took place in or around Philly, PA.  Some of the actual women were interviewed for this.

This may a great tool for young girls or women in math or computer classes to see.  The history of science is filled with instances of women being treated unequally.  Here the women were never included in printed photographs or given credit as much as male or female soldiers.  I am very interested in the subject of gender atypicality.  What little I've learned about female soldiers in the early and mid-1900s was that they did gender-typical work: delivering mail, being secretaries, etc.  This work was about women who created new paths.  It was crucial that many of these women loved math but didn't want to be forced to be math teachers.  For those who don't like how women are channeled into education as if that were their only option, this is a must-see.

Feminists interested in diversity have scolded others not to think of women as a monolithic group.  Race and class issues must be taken into consideration.  Here all these women are white.  Remember in ""A League of Our Own,"" there was a scene that admitted that while it was great that white women got to play professional baseball, it was tragic that Black women didn't also have that option?  The lack of diversity in this work is never brought up.  Were the female math majors at Spelman or Howard given this job offer?  If not, why not?  This work does seem to have a lot of women of a particular religion, but that it only slightly brought up.  As far as class, it's never stated, but these are women far from poverty.  The fact that they had college degrees when even lots of men didn't really says something.  I'm glad the work ended by acknowledging that while lots of blue-collar women were fired once ""the boys came home"" from war, these female computers were able to keep jobs without limitation.

World War II ends in the middle of this doc.  It is emphasized that these women's work played a role in the development of the computer and the enactment of the Cold War.

Gender issues aside, this work illustrates how primitive weapons and computers were back then.  There is much more discussion of friendly fire killing people then compared to now.  Also, this work doesn't fit well in a sound byte.  You had to discuss men on the battlefields to explain why these women were doing significant work.  Much of the time in this doc is spent explaining how A is related to B and B is related to C.  This may bore many viewers, especially antsy younger students.  When the women speak of college costing a whopping $400 or that they were paid the astronomical rate of $2,000 per year, you will chuckle a little.",1298678400,5,2804,4.606060606060606
4259962,4,B00443FMKC,"Top-Secret Rosies is a fairly good documentary but it is only a step towards properly recognizing the math, science, and technical roles filled by women. The documentary has a ""by the numbers"" feel  in its construction and its appeal for overdue recognition. But the story is too important too long held a secret. It is timely in that we can get first-person testimony from the women who lived it. The conclusion is that the quality of the story overcomes the shortcoming in the telling of the story.

I have read many books about many different aspects of World War II. I have had a long interest in things espionage related and topics formally too secret to have been be previously known. A theme that runs through many of these books is the role played by women. Women code-breakers were very important at England's Bletchley Park. Women are mentioned as serving in a number of critical roles in America's nuclear weapons development. And while there is a library of books by and about women serving in military uniforms nurses and Red Cross uniforms and the various ""Rosie the Riveter"" wartime manufacturing positions; hereto for I've only known of Navy Lieut. Grace Hopper as one of the women who directly contributed to both the war effort and the invention of the computer industry. Top-Secret Rosie represents the first effort I have seen that speaks to the role of groups of women in secret positions doing specifically advanced math and foundational computer-related work.

I frequently read that women do not test very well in the math and sciences. I am heartened to know that this gap is closing but often it is represented that we cannot close the gap without teaching methods that specifically target women. I lack the specific expertise to question the studies or the methodological recommendations. I suggest that if more women knew their heritage in the fields of math and science the flow of women into these courses would include more inspired students.

There was a job called computer before there was a machine called a computer. In war and peace many women held at these jobs in part because they were often not respected jobs. The women who become the focus of this documentary volunteered to serve their country as computers because they were patriotic and because they were trained mathematicians. By the end of the war they would've performed demanding and repetitious work that resulted in the artillery tables that made it possible for American soldiers and sailors to accurately deliver ordinance on target. Beyond this tedious work they would contribute to producing America's first computer programming. To fully appreciate this last statement you should know that this was a physical programming process made by inserting plugs and twisting dials on a massively large machine for which there was no instruction manual.

The last few years has seen a slow process whereby historians and documentarians sift through old and now declassified materials to identify populations of Americans whose significant contributions had not been previously recognized. Now that we know of the work of these women we owe it to these same women to ensure that as a nation we do a better job of recognizing and respecting all of those who would place contributions to the common welfare in front of purely selfish interest.",1434931200,3,3352,5.0
