4951656,3,B0064NTZCQ,"Just like in those classes you took on music and literature, or from talking to people who have to prove their own worth through the analysis of works of art that they could not dream of creating, this production does inform. I learned some things. But this production has no heart and no soul. British voices named Nigel from overstuffed armchairs. This is the CIA / MI5 analysis of Tom Waits. You might want to watch this. Me, I plan to follow it up with a healthy dose of whatever I can get my hands on from my brother Waits. Really, you who produced this need to abandon the sterile, clinical, heartless approach. Get a heart. Get a sense of humor. Get into the groove that Mr. Waits makes so attractive. Leave your Kant on the silver plate with the Butler. Listen to the barker and go into the tent to see Jojo the Dog Boy. Those who speak on this production enjoy Tom Waits in the same way that aficionados of sterilization praise Joseph Lister. Just listen to Tom Waits. It is enough. In this production, justice is not served. Just let Tom speak for himself. It is enough.",1394496000,11,1080,4.405
4951657,5,B0064NTZCQ,"I have listened to all but 3 of Tom's cds.  I have read 2 biography's (unauthorized) and 'Waits on Waits' a book of his interviews and numerous magazine articles.
I wasn't sure what to expect of this offering. By now I think I know a little bit about the man in as much as any outsider can.  I am very much in tune with his views on life, such as they are, and what is in print.  I have only watched the first of this 2 dvd set.
I am pleased with the former musicians featured and their view points. Several others that have worked with Tom are also included.  It is an overview of the man. What pieces are left out are compensated for with the use of black and white videos so you can see what Tom saw as an inspiration for his early work.  The first dvd ends with Toms working on 'Heart attack & Vine'.  In watching this I was moved to tears which did not happen when reading his material.  Good clips of Tom at play and how each cd came about.  Good commentary. Can't wait to see the other dvd.  Highly recommended.",1370736000,15,1018,4.101010101010101
4951658,5,B0064NTZCQ,"Another critical review of Tom Waits' work. An addition to ""Under the influence..."", ""Tom Waits Juke Box"".  All interesting if not artist authorized reviews.",1369699200,5,157,5.541666666666667
4951659,4,B0064NTZCQ,I like to find anything that has to do with Tom Waits. There are some other dvd's out there so there is some duplication on these dvd's. I don't think there is anything that he has authorized,1357603200,2,191,4.1891891891891895
8492687,1,B0064NTZCQ,I am returning this to you.  I put it on to play and within 5 minutes it stuck on a shot of a computer key board and did not move any further.  It is the poorest quality of filming and recording that I have met on a DVD.,1473379200,,220,3.5625
8492688,5,B0064NTZCQ,An interesting DVD of Tom Waits early career in music prior to having  a formal contract,1456790400,,88,4.5
8492689,2,B0064NTZCQ,"First hour of this and there's maybe five minutes of footage of Tom, and like someone else said, it's all on YouTube. This is primarily a bunch of British critics who like to hear themselves...some of the stuff from Bones Howe is kind of interesting, but already known. If you'd never heard of Waits, you'd come away with a terrible impression of him and his talent. If you're a fan, this will bore and infuriate you. Most of this is interviews with Howe, the Brit critics and voice over of panning shots of Waits' PR still photos. Very little footage of Tom performing. The case states in capital letters: THIS DVD PACKAGE RELIES ON INDEPENDENT CRITICAL OPINION AND REQUIRES INDEPENDENT EDITORIAL CONTROL. THIS SET IS NOT SANCTIONED BY TOM WAITS OR ANY OF HIS REPRESENTATIVES. Obviously...The Complete Review? Hardly. A waste of time and money.",1454371200,2,845,4.834482758620689

8492691,4,B0064NTZCQ,"A must-have for hardcore Tom Waits fans. It may not be amazing by most music biopic standards, but with Tom being as reclusive as he is, we should enjoy what we can get. I found that I disagreed with a lot of the album assessments in this documentary, but that just shows what a varied bunch Waits fans are, and how despite being such a niche artist, Waits can strike chords with a wide variety of people. That was a run-on sentence.",1444521600,,433,4.2926829268292686
8492692,5,B0064NTZCQ,Great vintage Tom Waits. More than just a concert film.,1442880000,,55,4.6
8492693,3,B0064NTZCQ,"In spite of my love for Waits this dvd was a disappointment.  the first disc had footage that I have seen on you tube.  The second disc was an exact copy of ""Second Hand Stories,"" that I purchased on Amazon some time ago.  I have watched ""Second Hand,,,"" so many times that I'm bored with it.  Less talking heads and more Tom.",1415404800,3,326,4.209677419354839
