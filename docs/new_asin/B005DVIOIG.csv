4662303,5,B005DVIOIG,"Luthur the first season (6 episodes) was TV watching at it's finest.  Idris Elba is one of the few men I believe my wife would leave me for!  What charm, what grace what talent!  Idris Elba literally sets the screen on fire.  If you loved him in The Wire (and you should have) then you are in for a real treat in both seasons 1 and 2 of Luther.
Now I get that two episodes is ""not a season"" but 180 minutes of great writing and great acting and great stories is worth every cent of 25 bucks!  There isn't a mainstream movie out there right now worth the time or the money but two or three nights with Idris and company is worth buttering up the corn.
I don't usually write reviews in response to other reviews but anything less than 5 stars for this show is just sour grapes and I'd hate for people who loved The Wire and Downtown Abbey and Garrow's Law to name but a few current 5 star efforts to miss this one.",1319846400,18,912,4.072625698324022
4662304,5,B005DVIOIG,"I know that mantra gets overused but it's true when speaking of Luther. This is simply an outstanding show. My only criticism of Series 2 is how brief it was. I was disappointed not to get 6 episodes again. I felt like it was over before it really started. Regardless, it's one of my favorite shows and can't wait for season 3.",1319587200,,327,4.290322580645161
4662305,5,B005DVIOIG,Unbelievably well acted...Idris Elba is phenomenal and so are the story lines. Even better than Wallander which is saying a lot.,1319241600,2,128,5.142857142857143
4662306,5,B005DVIOIG,"You know the old joke about the women complaining about the food at a restaurant in the Catskills? ""This food is terrible,"" says one. ""Yes,"" agrees her companion, ""and the portions are so small.""

Luther is like that joke in reverse. ""This show is so  great, but the portions are too small.""

Do four episodes really constitute a season? I was left wanting more after the six episodes of the first season. What am I going to do until Season 3?

The lead character is an intriguing mix of deeply flawed humanity and world weariness -- a hero for our times. While I wish there had been more of his unlikely ally crazy Alice in this season, the finale holds out the hope that she will reappear in Season 3. I can hardly wait.

More, more!",1319241600,21,735,4.375
4662307,5,B005DVIOIG,"Luther is usually a pretty clever show, but this just raised the bar. Idris (main actor) gives us two glimpses of Luther's state of mind-- full of both hope and despair.

This is a must see for anybody who like crime shows, dramas, and even dark comedy.",1319155200,3,253,4.382978723404255
4662308,4,B005DVIOIG,"Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict --The initial premise of Luther was almost amusingly conventional: a detective is great at his job, but struggles with quite a few issues in his personal life? And he has a different case to solve every week? We've only seen that show a few thousand times at this point. However, the first season of Luther quickly established a number of elements that permitted it to stand out as its own beast. First and foremost was the relationship between Luther and devilish killer Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson, The Prisoner), which offered an entertaining variation on the Hannibal Lecter/Clarice Starling dynamic. Despite their obvious differences of opinion on the law and, y'know, whether it's cool to just kill people, the fact that the two understand each other is often enough to outweigh all of that. It's an unlikely relationship which is nearly impossible to believe at times, but Elba and Wilson make it work.

One major improvement between this season and the last: the done-in-one plots have been substituted with more protracted cases, giving Luther 2 the feeling of being a proper miniseries rather than just a collection of episodes. The first two episodes focus on the masked killer, the latter two episodes focus on the role playing killer, and Luther's attempts to aid a troubled young woman (along with a handful of other, smaller subplots) take the entire season to resolve. As a result, the show feels bigger, more cinematic and the inevitable showdowns manage to achieve a greater weight than before.

Luther arrives on DVD sporting a handsome transfer. The level of detail is impressive, blacks are deep and inky and flesh tones are warm and natural. The four episodes are spread across two discs, and the transfer seems to benefit from this fact (many TV show discs are stuffed to maximum capacity with content). Audio is also exceptional, with the musical score playing an even more prominent role in this season (there's some Howard Shore-inspired material in the first two episodes which is positively thunderous). Audio is clean and clear, and the sound design is solid enough. No extras are included.

4662309,4,B005DVIOIG,"Luther 2 was shorter than what I had anticipated but the character development is still great. Understanding that Luther is going through a period of mourning after Ep6 Luther 1, he's trying to find himself/his center of being in his crazy maze of a life. Nevertheless, he is who he is and he lives among his work.

I didn't like characterization of serial killers...too young, to predictable, wish they were more edgy/freaky/weird. Boys just out of puberty attempting to be serial killers...did not make me quiver at all.

I missed Alice...love the banter between she and Luther. What flavor they add to the show. We need her back in a big way in Luther 3 and there will be a Luther 3.

If you love good acting, character development and awesome shots of London you will like Luther 2.",1318377600,5,786,4.640287769784172
4662310,5,B005DVIOIG,"I LOVED Luther series 1. and I thought all of the 6 episodes were quite good. As Series 1 ended, it left off with a cliffhanger and how most of us Luther fans want to see more that is totally what we will do. I have to say, I know and can tell that many people don't like Series 2, but i think that Series 2 is quite good and would fully recommend buying it. i will!
Alice Morgan is back in Series 2 and I happen to love Alice Morgan. The situations that Luther comes across and pursues are quite good and I look forward to this Series 2 coming out on DVD and I look forward to Series 3. :) :) :)",1316476800,17,596,3.814516129032258
4662311,2,B005DVIOIG,"Well, if you're reading this review and have seen the first series of LUTHER, and are making up your mind regarding purchasing series 2, possibly this review can assist.

Season 1 ended on a cliffhanger, so more than likely you're going to want to eventually see how that cliffhanger plays out in season 2.

The only real question being whether you purchase the DVD, rent the DVD, or borrow a friend's DVD.

Which one you're inclined to, depends on how much you liked season 1.

Season 1 was 6 episodes, and I thought the first 4 episodes were FANTASTIC, but in the 5th episode it goes off the rails, nicking its twist from a popular US show (the same thing would happen in season 2, a popular US crime show idea/storyline, 'borrowed' for the twist).

From that twist on Neil Cross' writing devolves into cliche, and wild irrationaliaty, indeed stupidity that mars the entire end of Season 1. That cliched writing, and irrationality unfortunately not only continues in Season 2, but escalates (season 2 by the way being only a very brief 4 episodes, another thing to consider before shelling out for this expensive, and featureless 2 disc set)

So if like myself you felt the ending of Season 1 was poorly done, you'll feel the same about the entirety of season 2, especially most of the new additions to the cast. However if you thought the cliffhanger of season 1 was good, well you're in for more of the same.

For a full review go here:

My vote: While I do recommend owning season 1 (even though it drops the ball, it's first four episodes make up for it), I can't say the same thing about season 2. Don't pay to buy it, don't even pay to rent it, borrow it from a friend.(If you do insist on buying, even with shipping it's cheaper to buy it from Amazon UK, then paying the marked up US prices)

Hope this has helped.",1316304000,18,1857,4.483679525222552
4662312,3,B005DVIOIG,"Season 2 is a disappointment.  First, we drop to four episodes.  Second, there are only two stories inside one overall story.  Lastly, the bad guys a banal lacking the freighting of season one.

4662375,5,B005DVIOIG,"I'm in the beginning episodes of season 2, and I've been surprised how good this show has been. It's individual episodes are well crafted police procedurals, but it's the over-arching storyline of a character on the edge which is really riveting. Idris Elba has created an intensely driven, magnetic protagonist who battles to keep himself and his life from falling apart; but it is his ongoing, symbiotic relationship with Alice, a smart and sexy serial killer, that really takes this show to the edge. She is the cooling calm to his fever, but demonic in her own way. It's a fascinating tension, quite unlike any other relationship I can think of in the genre. Season 1 also portrayed the corruption and fall of one of Luther's detective colleagues, which is again rather unlike others shows in the genre. And so the characters, the acting, the layered plot, and the unexpected tensions all work to make this an intensely interesting series well worth watching. Highly recommended.",1457308800,2,983,4.963636363636364

4662442,3,B005DVIOIG,"Idris Elba portrays the lead character, John Luther, with depth and intensity. The supporting cast is generally solid; however, the plot is diminished by the gruesome brutality of the crimes.

Much preferred is Season 1 which featured more interaction with the antagonist character Alice Morgan (played by Ruth Wilson). Their interaction, which added tension and interest, is present at times in Season 2 but in my opinion not nearly enough. Lacking that tension between characters, the producers seem to have resorted to using blatant violence for shock value which diminishes focus on the acting itself.",1419120000,,605,5.368421052631579

Luther is about a man who is constantly faced with moral dilemmas, the solutions of which are always in one way or another wrong, but watching Luther resolve the issue makes the choice absolutely correct.  This series is must see watching for anyone interested in philosophy, anti-heroes, edgy drama or linguistics (diverse accents abound).

4662469,5,B005DVIOIG,This was purchased from Amazon for me. It is such a wonder to watch a tv show that is clear and concise in terms of a primary plot with characters who appear to be actual people speaking real words. And most of all no guns for the every day police. This is so HARD for me to understand. I guess it may be different now. Luther is so real that you forget he is an actor. The other actors are also so very real I enjoy this show  enough to look at it again.,1415404800,,455,3.8404255319148937

4662473,4,B005DVIOIG,I enjoyed all 3 seasons of the series Luther staring Idris Elba. The episodes were fast pace and kept me on the edge of my seat. Elba plays a very complex character and he carries the lead role very well. The only thing I didn't like about the series was the number of episodes per season. It would have been nice if the stories were drawn out over 10 or 13 episodes instead of four. I hope that there are more seasons ahead for this character.,1415059200,,444,4.174418604651163

4662479,5,B005DVIOIG,"I do not often give reviews, even on what would be considered the better programs, mostly because they do not deserve a review, but in this case, it deserves the best of the best of reviews of which I will falls short, no doubt.  Often times people use hundreds of words to describe something, but after all it is only a perspective one way or the other.

Luther the first season started slow, attempting to try and figure out who is who? It used to be easier, the bad guys wore black hats and the good guys wore white hats. In Luther's case it is difficult to figure out which hat he wares, then somewhere around the first season and the forth show it starts coming together and is literally one of the best shows I have seen that is written well above any standard and the acting is superior to most. The US has never produced this sort of captivating quality in any of its shows thus far. US keep working at it, maybe one of these days we might come up with something half as good.

I did not want to write something that told about the plot or about the series. I wanted to give a review that would make one want to watch the show to see for yourself the actors, writing and even the production to judge for yourself. I tend to believe that viewers are more intelligent than what US tv shows tend to believe about their audiences. It is almost like most tv shows in the US need to tell you if something is funny or sad because we are too stupid to figure it out on our own, which is not the case with Luther. I would be very pleased if Luther survived longer than the actors, but then they would have to call it something other than Luther if it lasted that long?

Best description I can come up with for the series is ""Enjoy.""",1414022400,,1731,4.173652694610778

4662546,5,B005DVIOIG,"Luther is an outstanding series. Idris Elba is superb as John Luther, giving a very nuanced, sensitive, and intelligent performance. The rest of the cast is also excellent.  Season 2 is, in my opinion, even better than the first season -- and that's saying something!  I don't want to spoil anything for the viewer by giving away too much detail about the plot -- please let it suffice to say that it is fresh, very creative, complicated, and intensely compelling. Luther is walking a razor's edge professionally and personally. In fact, there are two main plots careening through this season, and a solid sub-plot that get intensely entwined.  The writers have done a great job in keeping the pace going at break-neck speed, but without sacrificing character development or creating confusion.  I enthusiastically recommend this series.",1407110400,,837,5.132352941176471

4662639,5,B005DVIOIG,A+ drama. This show keeps your attention from beginning to end. You need to watch from the beginning of the first season to truly understand exactly what is going on. But each episode can stand on its own. Too bad this ended after 3 seasons because we need more quality TV like this show.  But I hear there is a movie coming soon!,1399161600,,330,4.238095238095238

4662651,4,B005DVIOIG,"British cop shows may be grittier and more sophisticated than American cop shows, but they're just as unrealistic. By the end of the initial 6-episode run of the show, police Detective Chief Inspector John Luther (Idris Elba) had attempted to kill a man, been an accessory to Alice's (Ruth Wilson) murders of at least two men, covered up a laundry list of crimes, evaded police custody, assaulted fellow officers, and finally been caught at a murder scene, smack in the middle of a web of obvious lies and deceit.

Is he in jail now? No, he's now on a major crimes task force, led somehow by the wily old guy who from internal affairs who, just last season, was Luther's nemesis. How did Luther escape prosecution? The only halfway plausible explanation is that the department was too incompetent to fully uncover his wrongdoing and too embarrassed to do anything about what it did know.

In any event, at the outset of the second season, Luther is reduced to playing Russian roulette. That's how despondent he is at the loss of his estranged wife Zoe and how disenchanted he is with his life as a police officer. Living in what looks like an abandoned building -- everybody in this show seems to be living either in crumbling slums or in the lap of luxury -- Luther's is clearly miserable. When he's emotionally blackmailed into helping a woman's (Kierston Wareing) daughter escape prostitution (Jenny Jones, played by Aimee-Ffion Edwards), and when his rescue of the exploited girl turns out to be the trigger of a trap, Luther's happiness takes a further dive. (Why Luther feels any obligation towards the mother, a truly horrible woman, is never adequately explained. Nor is there an adequate explanation of why Luther's first instinct is always to break the law.) Luther's usual brilliance shines through when he's called upon to stop and capture two serial killers, but the heart of this short, four-episode season is Luther's relationship with Jenny and his efforts to keep her -- and himself -- out of deadly trouble.

Elba is as intense, powerful, and explosive as he was in the first season, but his emotional range is pretty much from mopey to raging to sad-eyed-but-deeply-engaged. A few of his scenes with Edwards are sweet and touching. Dermot Crowley continues to project sly intelligence as DSU Martin Schenk, and Nikki Amuka-Bird gives a creditable performance as a very green, very anxious DCI Erin Gray. Those hoping for more development of the relationship between Luther and Alice, alas, will disappointed by the paucity of interaction between the two, but what little there is proves to be, as always, wickedly wry.",1398902400,,2637,4.908071748878924
4662652,4,B005DVIOIG,"A very well made series that I found entertaining - that proves it is possible to make really good detective stories without the violence and gory scenes so often seen in other productions while still remaining ""exciting"" to watch.

I love his acting, his character is so on the edge, he puts himself in harms way time after time again.  this show is very suspenseful, reminds me of a cross between Scandal and Criminal Minds, but with better acting.  You never know what you will get with this show...who will die, what type of killer they will deal with, etc. I wish season 3 was free for Prime members, since Amazon has jacked up the annual price.

4662676,4,B005DVIOIG,Listen hard to the dialogue because it sounds like they are speaking a 'broken' Cockney. Im not from the country but at times I must disassemble the dialogue to make it work for me. The acting is great. The stories at times run off the rails.,1395705600,,242,4.282608695652174
4662677,4,B005DVIOIG,The spoiled little porn star is no comparison to the really wicked but misunderstood psychopath.  I liked it when she and Luther worked together to fight evil.  Neat that Luther helped her escape from the hospital for criminally insane.  I understand she has her own program now though.  Luther continues to be the kind of cop I love.  Knows the rules and knows criminal minds.  Knows how to use them both to his advantage.,1395705600,,423,4.648648648648648
4662678,5,B005DVIOIG,Can't wait for the next season to start. Wondering what is in store for Alice and John in the next episodes?,1395619200,,108,4.190476190476191
4662679,5,B005DVIOIG,Really enjoyed watching Luther 2!  Idris Elba and supporting cast a very good.  I like it so much I ordered Luther Season 2.,1395360000,,124,4.3478260869565215
4662680,5,B005DVIOIG,"My wife and I love this show.  I can't stand much tv so it's rare that we spend much tv time together.  But this keeps us cuddled and engrossed every time.  I'm really glad she found it since after Breaking Bad was over all we had was House of Cards.

It's excellent acting and writing.",1395273600,,286,4.1454545454545455

4662682,2,B005DVIOIG,"Luther Luther Luther...tell us why do you make such stupid mistakes? Maybe it is so a disappointing series like this can exist?
Idris you are so much better than this!",1394928000,,167,4.6
4662683,5,B005DVIOIG,"Luther is great.  Hepped-up, dynamic and action hitting.  Idris Elba is great as Luther.  I love this series and can't wait to hear when it is coming out again.",1394755200,,160,4.448275862068965
4662684,4,B005DVIOIG,"Complicated lead characterneither hero nor anti-hero, yet both on occasion.
Ensemble cast offers quality performances across the board
Female lead also dangerous and complex
Really looking forward to season 3
Also not the London one usually seestoothier, darker, more layered to add texture to the plot line",1394668800,,307,5.553191489361702
4662685,4,B005DVIOIG,"This is an excellent show, but the 4 episode season is so very short.  I would like it to be longer for two reasons--the first:  the episodes are very suspenseful and exciting.  The second:  I am enjoying getting to know the characters and their weaknesses and strengths.  Just ordered Season 3.",1394496000,,295,4.705882352941177

4662687,5,B005DVIOIG,"Each episode was like watching a captivating suspense thriller movie for an hour at a time. Since its condensed to an hour, I didn't have to endure the filler that 2-hour movies sometimes contain. Luther was ever the loveable, mixed up, well-intentioned, good looking, good-hearted guy that you want so badly to ""win"". I was riveted... totally wrapped up and watched practically all of the 3 seasons in one sitting. Outstanding job by Idris Elba.",1394236800,,446,4.96
4662688,5,B005DVIOIG,"This season was watched more like a prequel. After watching season 3, I was wondering how we got to that point. Season 1 introduces you to the main character Luther played by Idris Elba. He is quite a conflicted person dealing with a multitude of issues, oh and investigating cases also. Good series to watch if you're into police shows. It brings the UK, particularly London's police, and the way they handle cases. Interesting to note, the first line ""Coppers"" don't carry guns!!
The second season begins where season 1 leaves off and continues with all it's twists and turns!!",1394236800,,579,4.8
4662689,4,B005DVIOIG,Always looking for something new. I tend to binge watch and this fits the bill only wish the seasons were longer.,1394150400,,113,4.428571428571429
4662690,5,B005DVIOIG,Excellent follow-up of season one.  Characters continue to evolve as new problems arise.  More mind blowing battles of the minds.,1394064000,,129,5.4
4662691,4,B005DVIOIG,"Although the plot was fairly repetitive (Luther constantly betrayed while protecting another innocent), I was very entertained by the series. The villains seemed believably scary, even the good ones.",1393891200,,199,5.896551724137931
4662692,4,B005DVIOIG,"The season was a little short.  Although the storyline was enthralling, I wanted to see more of Luther and Alice working together.",1393891200,,130,4.909090909090909
4662693,5,B005DVIOIG,"Recently we binge-watched the first two seasons and man, oh, man is this a great series! I highly recommend it.",1393804800,,111,4.6
4662694,5,B005DVIOIG,"This is excellent casting and acting. Sophisticated and suspenseful. The character, John, is strong and vulnerable at the same time. I'm enthralled once again by a series and glad to have access to it on Amazon. Thanks.",1393718400,,219,4.945945945945946
4662695,5,B005DVIOIG,"This British series is so quirky and dark: the characters so off the Wall, but so believable... Can't wait to see the next episode of this unique series.",1393545600,,153,4.5
4662696,5,B005DVIOIG,Fantastic season...The more I watch the more I want to watch..Very entertaining and I find myself helping him to solve the crimes..He and I would make a great team..I would advise everyone who love crime dramas and cop shows to check Luther out...It's worth your time..,1393372800,,269,4.869565217391305
4662697,5,B005DVIOIG,I am hooked...I love Luther. It is action packed and you actually need to think about the plot. It's not predictable!!,1393372800,,118,4.666666666666667
4662698,5,B005DVIOIG,"The plot starts off quickly and Luther solves the case fairly quickly, doesn't leave you hanging through the whole show as to who done it like the other shows who drag it out and then it's someone you never saw before.  Enough action to keep it interesting.",1393372800,,257,4.468085106382978
4662699,5,B005DVIOIG,We enjoyed it very much because it was different than most shows of this type. Some things have changed this series but the show is still VERY entertaining. Definitely a show that we want to see more of in the future.,1393200000,,217,4.317073170731708
4662700,5,B005DVIOIG,Cannot wait to see more! The Cast is amazing and Idris Elba captured Luther's character perfectly. I wish there was more to watch,1393200000,,129,4.6521739130434785
4662711,5,B005DVIOIG,One of the best series I have ever watched.  The stories are gripping and the acting is phenomenal.  Idris Elba is now one of my all time favorites.  Amazing that LE in the UK do that kind of work with no firearm - would never happen here in the US - we'd have a lot more dead cops!  Absolutely brilliant show.,1393027200,,310,4.032786885245901
4662712,5,B005DVIOIG,"I absolutely love this show. Idris is one of my favorite actors. The show keeps you in suspense, love it!",1392940800,,105,4.3
4662713,5,B005DVIOIG,"It's a recipe for addiction. This fast paced, intense series kept me on my toes. I thought the camera work was sharp, I thought the writing was good and I thought there was good chemistry between the actors/characters. But, I thought a costume designer should have insisted on a change of clothes for Idris Elba/John Luther from the grey ensemble he wore in every show of every season!

I still loved this series!",1392940800,,413,4.657534246575342
4662714,5,B005DVIOIG,This series was recommended to me and I am loving it. Looking forward to viewing season 3. Series is full of action.,1392940800,,116,4.318181818181818
4662715,5,B005DVIOIG,My daughter suggested that I try this series.  One just can't help liking Luther's good/bad character.  Elba makes the character very real.  Luther's relationship with bad girl Alice is full  of surprises.  I am anxiously waiting for season 3.  I think Elba would be a terrific Alex Cross.  He has the necessary charisma.,1392940800,,321,4.943396226415095
4662716,5,B005DVIOIG,"Liked idris alba character and loved ""Alice""! Pretty suspenseful.
Is London that violent? And what's with all the hammers as weapons, I'm glad I live where someone would shoot me dead rather than bludgeon me with a hammer. Although that had nothing to do with how good the series was.
Just a pretty good series to watch.",1392768000,,320,4.631578947368421
4662717,4,B005DVIOIG,This is an interesting series but I enjoyed season 1 better. These are very short seasons (6 then 4 episodes) but good stories. They have a few different tacks on the solutions vs. similar American shows. The one thing I find a bit hard to fathom is how mixed up and troubled Luther is... yet he still manages to function on the thin edge of insanity.,1392681600,,351,4.333333333333333
4662718,5,B005DVIOIG,He is a Great Actor!! Wish the season was a little bit longer.  A show that my husband and I can both enjoy together.,1392681600,,117,3.875
4662719,5,B005DVIOIG,"The always-suffering Luther, a tall handsome slightly gruff man, slouches toward crimes to be solved, women to be protected, and bad guys to be killed. He is always in the right, even when he is wrong.",1392422400,,201,4.611111111111111
4662720,4,B005DVIOIG,"Luther didn't disappoint in Season 2! Beginning with Luther's recovery from loss to adjusting to new team members, Luther's ability to solve complex cases is unrivaled.",1392422400,,168,5.5
4662731,5,B005DVIOIG,Another great season. A bit shorter but still a brilliant series. idris does it again! Must see if u enjoy Dexter etc.,1392163200,,118,4.409090909090909
4662732,5,B005DVIOIG,"Enjoyed so much, I watched each episode twice.  Great writing and acting.  More of Alice to enjoy!  Luther continues to amaze and draw you in.",1391990400,,142,4.6
4662733,4,B005DVIOIG,Fan of Idris Elba since The Wire and he never disappoints. Interesting stories with an anti hero who want to dislike but you root for anyway.,1391990400,,141,4.461538461538462
4662734,5,B005DVIOIG,I enjoyed both seasons. Idris Elba is a star. I can't wait for Season 3. There aren't too many shows that I look forward to.,1391817600,,124,4.0
4662735,3,B005DVIOIG,"Luther is a five + star series but the lack of captions brought it down a couple of notches.  My Samsung Smart TV does not talk to Amazon on the issue of captions, and thus we were left trying to decipher British accents with age impaired hearing.  Not good.",1391817600,,258,4.244897959183674
4662736,5,B005DVIOIG,"The only part I dislike about this series is that there aren't enough episodes!  Again, British TV is seemingly better than American TV.  This series proves that.",1391731200,,162,4.962962962962963
4662737,5,B005DVIOIG,Idris continues to bring it in the second season. He's a very talented actor who has a lot to offer. They couldn't do the show without him and that says a lot for his contribution; he does carry the show and sets the tone for a wild ride.,1391558400,,238,3.9791666666666665
4662738,5,B005DVIOIG,"This is a gritty series that can be overly violent, but the intricacies of the characters make it well worth watching.  The decisions in Luther are never black and white, he always finds himself in the gray area.  Does the ends justify the means-sometimes. I watched the first two seasons on Netflix and couldn't wait for the third season to get there so I was willing to pay for it.  I only have three more shows to go. I will close the book on this series sadly.",1391558400,,464,4.310344827586207
4662739,4,B005DVIOIG,"Super engaging show,  twist and turns with each episode, cannot wait to see season 3.  John may not be the most honest and open Detective but he gets the job done.",1391385600,,163,4.225806451612903
4662740,5,B005DVIOIG,"Luther is gritty, a loose cannon at times, loyal to a fault but he definitely gets the job done.
A really good show.",1391385600,,116,4.086956521739131
4662741,5,B005DVIOIG,"Luther is simply the best ""copper"" show I've seen in decades...Idris Elba does not disappoint...fantastic actor, who brings a sense of realism to the series that is unique among his talents...perfect casting, and the writing is beyond excellent, each episode is as good as a movie I might pay richly for....only drawback with the series ""Luther"", there weren't more than 3 seasons...I do wish BBC would consider some follow-up specials...something like was done with the series ""Cracker"". Cheers to pipe dreams!",1391299200,,511,5.320987654320987
4662742,5,B005DVIOIG,Excellent acting--great characters and terrific plot lines. Much more interesting that the normal detective pap.. Onr of the better BBC productions that I hope more in the US will take the time to watch..,1391299200,,204,5.029411764705882

4662747,5,B005DVIOIG,"I Ioved Luthers roll and would like  to see more. Luther and Alice make a great team.

4662748,4,B005DVIOIG,It's a really good series! He's a grat actor and the show is well written. I love the whole concept that sometimes the good guy has to be bad for the right reason. Definitely a must see.,1390867200,,186,4.054054054054054
4662749,5,B005DVIOIG,"It isn't a flawless show, but it is very entertaining! Each season is better than the last. My real complaint...the season is way too short.",1390867200,,140,4.64

4662752,5,B005DVIOIG,"Luther is gripping, complex and a very good show. The story lines are unpredictable and interesting. The show draws you in and keep you coming back for more.

4662754,5,B005DVIOIG,"Sherlock Holmes meets Dexter.  The title character, Luther, is brooding and depressed but has an incredible knack for understanding serial killers and sociopaths.  Season Two is slightly less tense than Season One, allowing Luther to build deeper relationships with the other characters, but still has the same great story-telling and pacing of Season One.",1390262400,,356,5.574074074074074
4662755,5,B005DVIOIG,Morally ambiguous to a fault. addicting to watch. Elba rocks. Supporting cast is complicated and interacts well. Not to be missed mystery.,1390089600,,138,5.318181818181818

4662765,5,B005DVIOIG,"There is not a single two-dimensional character in this series.  It is an exploration of the broad streaks of decency and morality that run in even the most twisted of minds. A cop who counts as his friends cops and hookers and a sociopath murderer who will do anything for him, he doesn't expect but certainly receives that kind of loyalty in those who care about him. No one really ""gets"" him; most people are afraid of him on a visceral level because they know there's dark matter in there they just can't handle. He searches to the bottom of his soul for ways to protect the ones he loves, even if it means staying the hell away from them forever.

Space out your watching of this series--- it's so intense, it will take you days to surface if you try to do it in one sitting!",1389657600,,780,4.299319727891157

4662769,5,B005DVIOIG,"The trend in detective procedural shows has been for the lead detective to have some form of O.C.D. spectrum disorder.  Goren from ""Law and Order,"" who appears to have Asperger's Syndrom is a prime example. Luther has his problems, but they are the result of an over-refined sense of justice and moral obligation rather than a slight mental aberration.  Like senior officers in most dramas (and those few I've met in real life) Luther is a hard case--dealing with the uglier side of human nature, as their job requires, tends to make them that way.  However, Luther's innate sense of ""Right"" often overrides his sense of ""Duty"" leading him to make some error that he then has to spend time correcting.",1389398400,,701,4.776859504132231

4662782,4,B005DVIOIG,The series is great. Idris Elba is easy to watch but also heads up a very talented cast.  The story lines were edgy and not overdone. Loses one star for ultra short season.,1388966400,,172,4.212121212121212
4662783,4,B005DVIOIG,I enjoyed this season. Wish there were more episodes. Hopefully the final episodes and seasons become available here pretty soon.,1388880000,,129,5.5

4662785,5,B005DVIOIG,"I have heard that Idris Elba may be the next James Bond. That might be enough to make me want to go see them again. I missed Ruth Wilson in this season as her character Alice Morgan is mostly out of the picture, even still the show is far superior in it's writing, plot development, and any other markers that distinguish Luther as a top notch television drama. One never knows what is going to happen next.",1388880000,,407,4.298701298701299

4662787,5,B005DVIOIG,"I Love watching Idris Elba act and in Luther he just takes his acting to another level, I just don't know what to expect.  Especially, when he plays with the actress who plays Alice.  Yes, I would recommend Luther, Season 2",1388793600,,223,4.414634146341464

4662790,5,B005DVIOIG,"Luther is a tough-minded series that matches a  lot of the British programs, but the real attraction is Idris Elba.  He convinces the viewer that his creative approach to solving crime is a good one, even though it is sometimes illegal and borders on the immoral.  We have enjoyed the first two seasons so much that we are probably prepared to watch the 3rd season even though it costs money.",1388707200,,392,4.571428571428571

4662824,5,B005DVIOIG,"I enjoyed this TV series. Luther is a police detective in London. He is honorable and has a sense of justice larger than current procedures and practices allow. This gets him into trouble, helps break up his marriage and gets him into other scrapes. I liked the series quite a bit.",1388102400,,281,4.529411764705882
4662825,5,B005DVIOIG,Luther is so well written with many unexpected twists and turns. Idris Elba is wonderful in this part. He oozes stress. Love everything about him. Very dark and gritty.,1387843200,,168,4.827586206896552

4662844,5,B005DVIOIG,"If you can, watch Luther Season 1. One of the best cop programs I ever seen. And Season 1 episodes always twisted the story with more and more drama. Iris Elba is the man!",1387238400,,171,4.0588235294117645
4662845,5,B005DVIOIG,I love how he outsmarts the criminals. This particular season was sad but he seems to be a very strong man. Love the acting and how different the law enforcement in London is from US. Love the show. I want to see more.,1386979200,,218,4.093023255813954

4662850,3,B005DVIOIG,"This was such a weak follow-up to season one. The first season was one of the best cop shows I've seen in a long, long time; this was not nearly as good. It was still better than most American cop shows, though.",1386028800,,211,4.0476190476190474

4662857,3,B005DVIOIG,"Idris Elba is great ... sometimes the story lines are a little contrived, but I think he's an awesome actor. Sometimes it looks like he's trying to channel D'Onofrio, which I'm ok with!! :-)",1384387200,,190,4.617647058823529
4662858,4,B005DVIOIG,I truly enjoyed the drama and suspense. I also like the fact that mutilple plots were in affect. Great job!,1384387200,,107,4.4

4662863,4,B005DVIOIG,"Every episode is fast, clever and just very different than other law enforcement series. I would characterize this series as a law enforcement thriller. And you can't help but like Luther, even though he takes the law into his own hands while other law enforcement seek to bring him down using tactics just as questionable, if not worse. Lots of action and cerebral entertainment.",1383436800,,380,4.953125
4662864,5,B005DVIOIG,"FANTASTIC! FANTASTIC SHOW!

The show keeps you on the edge of your seat. This British show is much deeper& more controversial than American Detective shows. You see a real man (Gov Luther) driven by his beliefs of good & evil.

It is a MUST see.

I am buying season 3 which is not covered under Amazon Prime.",1383436800,,308,4.368421052631579
4662865,5,B005DVIOIG,"If you are not watching this series, you should start. You just can't beat the cast and gritty subject matter. Though psychologically painful at times, it is worth the pain to see a truly gifted actor in Idris Elba.",1383350400,,215,4.538461538461538
4662866,5,B005DVIOIG,"Luther isn't your typical cop. Elba gives him a humanity not often seen. The story lines are exceptional, and the play between Luther and Alice is riveting. I guess it's evident I love this series.",1383350400,,197,4.6571428571428575
4662867,5,B005DVIOIG,"I love this series! There is something about a flawed character that I find so very interesting, and Luther is definitely interesting and likable. The story lines are intricate and complex. If you haven't figured it out yet, I love this series. Do yourself a favor and watch this show.",1383264000,,285,4.72
4662868,5,B005DVIOIG,Great drama written around charactors that suffers that suffer the human conditions. I find the ingrediants used to make this program to be refreshing although sometimes a bit too dark.,1383264000,,185,5.2
4662869,5,B005DVIOIG,If you made it through season one...keep on going! Season 2 is really good. The new cast of evil villains that Luther must deal with are wonderfully imagined. Luther himself evolves and you begin to understand the demons he must deal with. He tows the line of ethics - and you will be surprised at every turn.,1383177600,,309,4.43859649122807
4662870,5,B005DVIOIG,Idris Elba returns as DCI John Luther for Season 2.  I love the way most BBC police procedural type shows emphasize the use of brains as opposed to firepower or brawn as most US cop dramas are prone to do. i Loved the finale and cant wait for a season 3.,1383177600,,254,3.980392156862745
4662871,5,B005DVIOIG,"Excellent writing, top line plots, great characters, entire cast of excellent acting and the cinematography of London is amazing....gray, gritty....it matches the mood of Luther....never a 'nice watch' as Luther is an inadvertent lethal character...have to watch to understand it.  Then the two gems of the show: Ruth Martin as Alice is unforgettable and brilliant....she has crazy chemistry with Idris Elba's Luther....Elba's won many awards for this portrayal...all very well deserved....he is a very special actor. I highly recommend all seasons of Luther ....production values are right up there with the extraordinary BBC's Sherlock.",1383091200,,638,5.787234042553192

4662885,5,B005DVIOIG,idris elba is spot on in this UK crime series. Character develop and storyline are great. Hopefully the BBC does not take the Spooks route with Luther,1381968000,,150,4.592592592592593

4662889,5,B005DVIOIG,I thought the first season was better in regards to plot and characters but it was still well done. Character growth is necessary to add strength to the theme.  I thoroughly enjoyed this season as well.,1381622400,,202,4.611111111111111
4662890,5,B005DVIOIG,interesting character-- flawed knight on a quest for justice amid random events and no rationale for what's meted out to miscreants and friends,1381449600,,143,5.260869565217392

4662897,4,B005DVIOIG,"I still can't understand why American television networks can't seem to get behind the idea of developing intelligent dramatic series.  John Luther is the kind of conflicted and complicated character that you just don't see on American police procedurals.  This series remains fresh, probably because of the limited number of episodes each season.  Unfortunately, given the ending to the fourth season, I fear the viewing public has seen the last of this series.",1380412800,,462,5.301369863013699

4662902,5,B005DVIOIG,"After you watch a few episodes of Luther you start to ask yourself why American TV can't seem to make a decent program. Sure, we have a few sparks like Justified, The Bridge and SOA, but BBC TV has it all working too with shows like Luther, Copper and Broadchurch. Why waste your time with ""The Real Housewives"" ?",1379980800,,313,4.322033898305085
4662903,5,B005DVIOIG,Fantastic series!  Suburb acting! Very refreshing original story lines. Love it and want more! Please tell mee there is a season three coming soon.,1379808000,,147,5.125
4662904,5,B005DVIOIG,"Idris Elba is an excellent actor & brings so much to the character.  The storyline is complicated which makes it more interesting.  Constantly waiting to see what happens next.  The character interaction is some of the best I have seen.  Highly recommend this series, especially if you like British television.",1379721600,,310,5.14
4662905,5,B005DVIOIG,"Love the series, it really keeps your interest through each episode and leaves you wanting more.  Can't wait for season 3",1379721600,,121,4.761904761904762
4662906,4,B005DVIOIG,This is a gritty program with interesting characters. Luther is a tough cop with his own moral compass. I hope another series is in the works.,1379635200,,142,4.5
4662907,4,B005DVIOIG,i love drama's from the BBC channel. The acting on this show is amazing and intense. Sad that it is ending.,1379548800,,107,4.142857142857143
4662908,5,B005DVIOIG,Awesome show. On the edge stories and superb acting. BBC America has awesome shows. I wish we had known about this channel sooner.,1379548800,,130,4.695652173913044
4662909,4,B005DVIOIG,"Scary guy, but he has heart of gold and the season was great, couldn't wait to keep going to season 3 and caught it on BBCA",1379462400,,123,3.769230769230769
4662910,5,B005DVIOIG,"Overall I enjoyed the series because it appears the writers have taken notice that a so called ""black male"" is capable of being placed in a leading role without a sidekick and an over-abundance of buffoonery.  Moving forward I'm hopefull he will not be shot in his buttocks or be required to wear a dress.  The character is highly intelligent and there is not a great deal of unrealistic special effects which is a plus.

Also the personal problems the character encounters adds to his credibility as he maintains his ability solve crimes with brilliance.  Since I do not watch television, this is a great outlet for me.  The actor chosen for this role seems perfect and I'm hopeful he will not be exchanged for a caucasian actor as the popularity of this series grows.

Respectfully,

Bokari B. Bey",1379376000,,799,4.705035971223022
4662911,4,B005DVIOIG,"As with the first season this is a super show. The story was riviting, and I have watched it a few times. The down side (its a big one) is that there are so very few episodes to the season. It is more like a mini series in my mind, not a season.
I couldn't decide if I should remove 1 or 2 stars for this reason, and ended up only taking away 1 star.
The acting, and writing are just so great that I was feeling generous.",1379289600,,421,3.7954545454545454
4662912,5,B005DVIOIG,I can not get enough of Idris Elba's portrayal of tortured London Detective Inspector John Luther. The intensity and suspense of Neil Cross's stories brought to life are unparalleled.  I cannot recommend this series highly enough!! Season 3 was just released on BBC America rounding out (ending) the show. SOOO sad.,1379203200,,315,5.176470588235294
4662913,4,B005DVIOIG,I think all of the Luther episodes are cutting edge with story lines that are not limited by  sensibilities and censors that exist across the water.  All the characters all fleshed out and complex.  John Luther is a dynamic volatile personality who may fine himself  on the wrong side of the line in an effort to sort out his feelings in the moment.,1379116800,,349,4.492063492063492
4662914,5,B005DVIOIG,what can I say except LOVE luther !!!!  fantastic show......very edgy....super story lines......I cant believe that season 3 is the final season.....are u crazy....this show should keep going on...........a must see show !!!!,1379116800,,225,5.818181818181818
4662915,5,B005DVIOIG,Great character from Idris Elba. Look forward to more of John Luther's adventures whether in television or film. Two thumbs up,1379116800,,126,5.0476190476190474
4662916,5,B005DVIOIG,Luther keep us entertained with his hysterical and non-orthodox detective skills.  What I love the most about this show is the fact that his ethnicity doesn't interfere at all with his duty as a detective. Watch it!,1379116800,,215,4.8108108108108105
4662917,4,B005DVIOIG,"John Luther, as a character, is incredibly likable. You want to be his friend. He is such a good guy that you are willing to follow him through gruesome crimes and some very contrived personal problems. Idris Elba is a fine actor. He truly and wonderfully carries the show. This is a good crime drama with a detective whose personal life is like a ""perils of Pauline""serial.",1379116800,,374,4.597014925373134
4662918,3,B005DVIOIG,"not bad.  season 1 still better.  too bad they got rid of alice & a few more characters.  luther's ""invincibility"" is getting boring.",1379030400,,133,4.695652173913044
4662919,5,B005DVIOIG,"After seeing season 3 on TV, I wanted to see more, My daughter had season 1. This whole series was well done without a lot of gore in the violence. Luther is quite the ""cooper"". It is also interesting to see the British Law. Alice is a very interesting character. Ruth Wilson is outstanding. I do hope there will be more in the future.",1378944000,,335,4.25
4662920,1,B005DVIOIG,Loved the show finally watched it on cable demand since I needed captions.  Amazon should be ashamed of their sound quality and lack of caption option!!!,1378771200,,153,4.884615384615385
4662921,4,B005DVIOIG,As always a great crime series from the Brits. Acting is superb and Luther is another troubled cop but somehow manages to do his job. Highly recommended.,1378771200,,153,4.703703703703703
4662922,4,B005DVIOIG,"Fascinatingly dreary and anchored by a smart, conflicted protagonist, Luther--complexly portrayed by Idris Elba--aided, of course, by interesting scripts and quirky supporting characters.  This is a world in which nobody is very, very good and many are quite bad.",1378512000,,263,5.743589743589744
4662923,5,B005DVIOIG,Characters are interesting and real. Elba is a nuanced actor. I am quite honestly hooked. Much better than most American tv.,1378425600,,124,4.9523809523809526
4662924,5,B005DVIOIG,Very interesting show I really enjoyed watching it. I wish there were more seasons to this series but I kind of know why it was shut down,1378252800,,137,4.111111111111111
4662925,5,B005DVIOIG,"I was travelling with my Kindle Fire and found this gem of a series, very happy I  did, cannot wait for season 3",1378166400,,112,3.869565217391304
4662926,5,B005DVIOIG,"The second season of Luther runs to just four episodes but in a format switch each story is two episodes long.

The advantage of this format is that the stories get a lot more time to develop. While in the first season there was a _monster of the week_ vibe to most of the murderers (Alice Morgan excepted of course), this time it's different and the situations are more developed.

Speaking of Ruth Wilson's Alice Morgan, her absence from the show is notable. She does appear in the first two episodes (briefly) but really doesn't tie into the plot. And the absence of that central character does leave a hole in the show.

Other than that, it's largely business as usual with Luther perpetually skirting the line of legality and sometimes crossing well over.

The acting is top to bottom good in Luther, but particularly in season two, the selling point is Idris Elba. His world weary Luther is believably sharp and just likable enough for you to accept his more out there behavior.

The situations presented stretch believability at times, but they are presented with such intensity that you don't really care to analyse that, you're just wondering where exactly it's going to go next.",1378166400,,1188,4.747572815533981
4662927,5,B005DVIOIG,Luther just keeps me wanting to see the next episode to find out what happens.  Idris Elba should play Othello.,1377993600,,111,4.55
4662928,5,B005DVIOIG,"The odd mix of characters  bound together by their work  keeps me glued to their stories. The crimes are almost secondary to the process that goes into solving them. The crimes are heinous, the criminals have borderline personalities. Luther is a gifted detective with a streak of self-destructiveness.

The American series Hill Street Blues and Homicide, Life on the Street seem placid in comparison, though each also features detectives bound together by work.

Viewers who dislike violence may find Luther difficult to watch.",1377820800,,528,5.325301204819277
4662929,5,B005DVIOIG,"Luther is smart, sexy, entertaining, and simply put, great tv. I was hooked from the first scene of episode 1. If you love cop shows, British dramas, or just enjoy superb character development, this is a must-watch.",1377820800,,215,4.837837837837838

4662931,5,B005DVIOIG,"Season 1 and 2 of Luther are just what a crime series should be.  Not too procedural, fantastic characters, and Idris Elba and his co-star deliver all the electricity required. Great writing and dialogue, great supporting cast.",1377820800,,227,5.135135135135135
4662932,5,B005DVIOIG,I think it would be difficult not to love any series or movie starring Elba.  He is just an extraordinary actor in this world of mediocrity.  The series is exciting and fun.  Elba would make a wonderful Bond!,1377734400,,208,4.421052631578948
4662933,5,B005DVIOIG,"Action packed, don't watch this show before you go to bed. I don't really get amped up about TV shows, but this one has the right balance of plot and action without the usual annoying romantic storyline!",1377734400,,203,4.513513513513513
4662934,5,B005DVIOIG,"Really like this show. Interesting crimes, great cop with his own issues even borderline tortured in his personal life. Real breath of fresh air after way too many cop shows from the u.s that always seem to deteriorate into some sort of relationship with the lead that takes over the show. He does have a nemesis which provides an interesting back story. Have since picked up a couple shows from bbc america since finding luther.",1377475200,,429,4.733333333333333

4662942,5,B005DVIOIG,"If you like intelligent detective / crime shows then this is a must see.
Idris Elba puts in a fantastic performance and Ruth Wilson as Alice is a must see!
BBC have really nailed it by keeping these seasons short and to the point.  No long rambling episodes just to fill up a traditional 12 episode season.

2 thumbs up.",1376352000,,320,4.316666666666666

4662946,5,B005DVIOIG,I didn't think I would like Luther but boy was I wrong. The show is fantastic! Elba is a real treat to watch. He's a gifted actor headlining a show full of gifted actors! These guys are fascinating to observe as they negate intricate plots and deep philosophical quandaries. Great show!,1376006400,,286,4.627450980392157

4662955,4,B005DVIOIG,"This season continues the mysteries that were identified in the first series.

Elba captures the conflict, anger and emotional instability of this police officer who wants to do things right (in a way) but who is stymied but ""regulations."" Hiding a body (of a person he didn't kill) seemed extreme, but it followed Elba's character's pattern of doing things the hard way because he might be in trouble (from his job or others) if he does them the right way.

4662957,5,B005DVIOIG,"I loved S1 and while the crimes in S2 are even more 'over-the-top' -- the series does not disappoint. Idris Elba is just riveting in this role, so suspension of logic or belief is not even an issue for me.",1374364800,,205,4.15

4662963,5,B005DVIOIG,"If you like edgy british cop dramas, you'll love Luther. Everything about this production is excellent, most of all Idris Elba as Luther.

Murder and mayhem as only the Brits can deliver!",1373155200,,345,4.766666666666667

4662968,3,B005DVIOIG,Decent series with a few interesting plot twist. It was a nice change of pace from the norm. Would watch a season 3.,1371945600,,116,4.086956521739131
4662969,5,B005DVIOIG,"The second season of Luther was excellent which I doubted it could be, since season one was incredible, especially the scenes between Luther and Alice.  We saw a bit more of how Luther was willing to go to the edges of what he considers the ""limits of what is right"" and ""still stay within the law"", when it came to protecting Jennie.  Call me naive but I never got the feeling that his behavior and feelings toward her were other than honorable because he saw her simply as an innocent young girl who was being used by others. Perhaps Luther was trying to make up for having put her father in jail (well deserved as it was)and leaving her with an uncaring mother, and/or perhaps he was attempting to make up for not being there for his wife when she really needed his help.

This season really allowed the actor, Idris Elba, to display his acting chops, as well as, all the other actors playing roles in the homicide department.  Each one brings something special to the role and it really matters when the team is moving at a mad cap pace trying to solve the crime as the murderer eludes them by seconds.  The actress playing the new detective is very good and her inner turmoil over whether she should report Luther or not is believable and when she does and is shunned by the Head of the Division, her reaction is heart breaking.

Can't wait till next season and hope to see more of ""Luther"", the flawed human being, brilliant detective and hopefully get more of an inside of the man.  Also, would love to see Alice.  I would recommend this show to anyone who loves a good detective story delivered by wonderful actors who have a brilliant script to work from.",1371513600,,1664,4.4506578947368425
4662970,5,B005DVIOIG,"I was looking for another TV series to follow and this one fit the bill. Season 1 pulled me in with an intelligent, cosmopolitan cast filled with multi-dimensional characters and left me wanting more. Well done.

If I have to post a dislikethere could have been fewer plots based on women being mutilated. Personal preference.

I haven't finished Season 2 yet so we shall see but so far the writing is as solid as the first.",1371427200,,424,4.565789473684211

Idris Elba does a fantastic job of playing this character who is dedicated to helping people in his work with strength and sensitivity. This show can be quite dark as Luther pushes the limits of what police can and cannot do to catch really bad criminals and help those that are their victims. I highly recommend this show, but I am very sorry there are only two seasons. I can't understand why it was cancelled. Fine actors, fine script!",1370390400,,600,4.513761467889908

4662995,5,B005DVIOIG,"Luther is a complex and often tortured man.  He wants to be good, but its like the evil that he has to overcome every day in his work as a homicide detective has eaten away the capacity to feel joy or to believe in much.  The acting is superior.  The stories are sometimes very hard to take, very violent, but somehow that seems just the way it is in Luther's world.  My favorite part of watching this is to see him pop out of his seat, his eyebrows flying up, ready to strike out at his nemesis, when his mental processing reaches a fever pitch.  At that point, you know he has become an avenging angel, and all hell is about to break lose.  Good show, but be advised, at times gruesome, at times so morally repelling that you go past feeling sorry for Luther to joining him in being will to do - almost - anything in retaliation.  You'll either love it or hate it.",1368144000,,866,4.180722891566265

4663013,3,B005DVIOIG,The second season didin't live up to the excitement and thrill of season one.

4663023,5,B005DVIOIG,"Season 1 of Luther set the bar pretty high. The last two episodes were brilliant and feature some of the finest writing regardless of genre or medium.

Season 2 continues this strong line of writing. Nothing seems contrived. Our characters are very real. If anything, a lack of Alice Morgan may be one complaint; however, this was a result of the writers allowing a natural progression from season 1 to season 2.

It may be a ""procedural,"" but you never feel that way when watching. If you enjoy great acting and incredible story/writing, you should be watching Luther. Season 2 continues to pack the same effective punch established in season 1.",1360108800,,646,4.8108108108108105
4663024,4,B005DVIOIG,"Season 2 picks up from the conclusion of the first series, which was an engaging detective series with the quirky, though occasionally tiresome, twist of Luther's continuing battle with the young murderess, Alice Morgan.

But if there was ever a show that needed the benefit of subtitles for non-native (American) listeners, Luther is it. Every episode includes several scenes with important dialog that was indecipherable to my ear. As I remember, the banter in the headquarters was often the hardest to understand. Too bad that Amazon's streaming service doesn't provide subtitles. Nevertheless, looking forward to watching more of Luther Season 2.",1360022400,,650,5.435643564356436
4663025,5,B005DVIOIG,"Idris Elba in a role that could only be played by him.  Smart, gripping, and dark.  As someone who lived in London I can say this show captures the (sometimes) gloominess of the city perfectly and uses it to the advantage of the story line.",1359849600,,240,4.311111111111111

4663028,4,B005DVIOIG,"There are subtle differences between season one and season two that knock the latter collection down a notch. For one, season two consists of just four episodes, but they were originally set up as two hour blocks, so the first two episodes share the same main story, as does the next two episodes. This means that only two cases are worked in the second season. In addition, the previous police division that Luther was a part of was closed down, so Luther now works for a newly formed division run by former internal affairs-style nemesis Schenk. Although Schenk is much better in the role of division head than Teller from last season, and Ripley returns as Luther's partner (expanding on their relationship from the first season), the newly added DS Gray is an annoying and unnecessary character who never fully develops due to the short season length. Additionally, moving from the old police building into a newer building that's more reminiscent of office cubicles takes away from the atmosphere and character of the original setting.

Two other problems with the show reduce its emotional effectiveness. Alice is only present in two episodes, and although her and Luther's complicated relationship continues to grow, she wasn't involved in the investigation at all, and didn't receive nearly enough screen time. Also, with the death of Luther's wife in the first season, the new underlying story of Luther's attempt to rescue Jenny lacks the impact of the Zoe storyline, and the characters aren't very likeable. We also aren't given any idea why Alice was sent to a mental institution for killing Ian Reed last season, considering that she saved Luther's life in the process. With the Jenny storyline, we're only given a small look at why Luther would even care about the plight of her and her mother.

Despite these detractions, season two is still a great ride. Idris Elba continues his fantastic portrayal of Luther, and the major villains are every bit as creepy as the first season.",1358899200,,1994,4.949253731343283

4663030,5,B005DVIOIG,"This is simply one of the best crime dramas you may ever watch. Only season 1 can compare to this. You really wonder what's going to happen to him and is he going to snap. He appears to be a man on the edge continually and one can only stay there so long. My biggest regret was there only being four episodes. How can that be? I want six, dang it!

4663049,5,B005DVIOIG,"The Brits do it right. This character is so beautifully flawed and emotional, yet you love him. His acting is so superb and genuine, and you really feel the passion he has for everything he does. The criminals are so evil and the back story of Luther and his complicated life always thread through the crime plot perfectly. I definitely recommend watching them in order (ROKU is the best). Quality actors, and awesome series! Every episode is so intense and SO suspenseful you really don't want it to end. A lot of surprises. Everyone I recommended it to loves it. The other characters are extremely well developed and also all great actors. Each episode/season is as good as the next and I can't wait for it to start up again.

Drama/TV well-worth the minimal cost of purchase: BLISS..!! Buy it. Sit back..Enjoy!!,1355097600,,363,5.5
4663056,5,B005DVIOIG,First of all see my review on Luther Season 1. No don't invite friends over to watch an episode of Luther. Because you end up awake all night because THEY want to watch the entire season. This may be the greatest detective series EVER ! The British have done it again. And COPPER is almost as good too. But Det. Chief Inspector John Luther is like no other detective you have ever seen. Season 1 was off the chain and season 2 picks up where 1 left off. If Idris Elba comes to America he could be the next Sidney Poitier. But he must pick better scripts than Prometheus. His talents were wasted as the ship's captain. The fact that BET picked up Luther season 1 from the Brits says a lot.,1355011200,,688,4.21969696969697
4663057,5,B005DVIOIG,"Elba has such a presence in Luther that he sucks up the energy in the room when he enters. Luther is my favorite character played by Elba, and I wish he would give us another 1 or 2 seasons. I especially want to see some more involvement of Alice helping him solve some murders and saving his ass a couple of more times. I will keep my eyes open for any new or even past roles he has done in movies and TV. He had a good role in Prometheus.",1354579200,,440,3.9

The suspense and intellect displayed just charges the viewer and the roller coaster ride with John only leaves you wanting for more and more.

When he solves a crime, you are relieves with him. At first I didn't get Alice but gosh she is quite a character. Her candor and wittiness, let alone book and street smarts don't match the image, which makes her seem so unassuming, sinister and mischievous.

I think I'm looking forward to season 3 with the hopes of them reuniting and making it legit between them as a couple. But then there's the new girl Jenny who's obviously attracted to him...I hope that she doesn't make Alice go mad again.

4663061,5,B005DVIOIG,"I really liked season 1, and although I would say season 1 was overall better, the finale of season 2 completely caught me off guard, and could quite possibly be the best from any series I've ever seen!

I admit that the first two episodes of season 2 are not as good as season 1 - at least not to me; i felt the story got a bit redundant - but then the next two episodes made up for it, and surpassed season 1, particularly the ending of the finale...

I don't want to go into spoilers, so I will just say that I was stunned by the ending of the final episode of season 2. It was so well done and unique, and the criminal that Luther took on in this episode was fascinating...

Even though the season 2 finale is the stand-out episode of the series you need to watch the entire series in order to appreciate the outcome; you need to savor the moment and just think back to what Luther has been through to really absorb the intensity of the situation. As I watched I felt like Luther was thinking about his life and the way things unfolded as he laid it all on the line...

Others have wonderfully elaborated on the writing and acting, and I will agree in one word, AMAZING! To say that the amount of episodes is lacking actually makes this show even more worth it. How many worthless episodes does one really have to sit through due to ""network"" requirements. I honestly believe that Luther hit it on the head, keeping it short and to the point. This not only keeps the auidence capitivated, it also really focuses on the art of Acting. Its like watching a stage play, that you know will end, therefore, you have to cut out all the bull, and get to the point. Real life crime and violent acts are not complex, they are raw, fast, and dirty (I've been to combat twice, believe me). Few shows understand this, and even during parts of Luther where the ""action"" wanes, its still interesting. Bravo to BBC for taking a chance, and be forewarned, many other cable companies, and internet only based networks will begin to take this stance (Hulu, Netflix, etc, etc).

So would I recommend, yes, however, ownership likely is not worth it (due to price, and quantity of episodes). Therefore, DL, and stream if you can. Excellent show, acting, and writing, and honestly, anything with an English accent just sounds so darn proper (Ello Mate...Cheers).

At times both his boss and his colleagues would just like to see the back end of him. The thing is though, when facing what seems to be an insoluble problem, Luther thinks so far outside of the box that the insoluble becomes solved.  This series is another murder investigation.  If this sounds same old-same old to you, there are two developments I guarantee will keep you riveted to your seat.  One, Luther has to handle a malovelent madam to release a young girl from her prostitution clutches.  Doing this shows a combination of tenderness and ruthlessness.  Two, in a segment you will never forget, Luther walks down a London street talking to a perp while pouring gasoline from a can all over himself, taunting him over how much fun he can have making him into a human torch.

See, there is a knife killer in England who randomly chooses victims.  For the record, if you want to be a serial killer in the US, a knife isn't going to cut it (pardon the pun).  If you randomly knock on doors until someone opens a door, you will get eaten by someone's rottweiler.  Or, you will get clocked with someone's cast iron skillet.  Or, you will be pepper sprayed by an amused young co ed.  If you hide in the back seat of a cop car with your uber scary butcher knife, the cop will simply lock the doors and drive you to the station, where you will be met by a group of amused cops who wish to have a chuckle at your expense.  If you sneak into the back seat of a cop's personal car in LA with your scary knife, they'll plug you with their gun.  Because, I think you'll find a bullet will travel through upholstery with greater ease than that knife will.  In short, what kind of lame cop gets kidnapped by a guy holding a knife on him in the back seat of a car?

4663090,4,B005DVIOIG,"By Jim Clark, publisher Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS

Neil Cross, the creator of Luther, admits he borrowed from a couple other detectives, Sherlock Holmes and Columbo.
What really pulls viewers into this BBC mini-series is Luther's complex character.
By season 2 he is putting a new team together after taking a brief hiatus to morn his wife's death. John Luther toys with committing suicide, playing Russian roulette, but is torn between ending it and becoming immersed into another dark crime. The crime eventually wins -- realizing he's only fulfilled when deep in the violent nature of his work.
He also came back to save the career of one of his partners, Detective Justin Ripley, who frequently overlooks Luther's questionable methods. Another partner, Erin Gray, is apprehensive about getting close to Luther -- seeing him as possibly a dirty cop.
Luther also hangs with some colorful characters like Alice Morgan and Jenny Jones.
Alice met Luther after the murder of both her parents. Some suspected she killed them. Luther is attracted to her beauty and her mind, since she completed her PhD in astrophysics when she was just 13. She ends up institutionalized but Luther is drawn to her, to pick her mind. She sometimes seems like a friend and at other times, unstable.
Jenny is a teenage porn actress Luther has rescued from her employers, who set their sights on killing her and him. She moves in with the officer and becomes like his daughter.
Luther  star Idris Elba won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries and I have little doubt season 3 will be commissioned either late 2012 or early 2013.",1332201600,,1630,4.88086642599278

4663092,4,B005DVIOIG,"Luther returns. With a cliffhanger ending to season one, any fan of the show will be eager to get season two. They will not be disappointed.

Except by the amount of episodes. Call me a critic, but I don't consider 4 episodes of anything a ""season."" It's a month of weekly programming. The good news is this is Luther, and those minutes of those hours count. Idris Elba deserved every award he got for acting this role. Ruth Wilson, as the femme fatale, is much sexier acting like an English lady than a lot of actresses are dressing in bikinis and trying to be sex kittens. Minor characters are well drawn. Frank, a goon for the mafia, gets as much characterization as any of the protagonists on criminal minds have gotten in six seasons. This characterization occurs in the course of about 15 minutes. That's Luther in a nutshell, a parsimonious elevation of the crime procedural.

I was a tad bit disappointed that Alice didn't have more screen time. But the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. Any pair of adult friends isn't going to be pinned by the hip, if the relationship is true. Wilson and Elba have great chemistry, and Wilson's presence in scarce scenes is phenomenal, to the point she can realistically serve as a literary solution in an episode she's not in.

Four episodes though... I would have loved to buy the DVD, but I ended up settling on the shows in downloadable form. When the numbers get that low in terms of episodes, your saving some serious money by buying three dollar episodes as opposed to a 26 dollar disc.

The serial killers are truly phenomenal and Luther's relentless sleuthing is fascinating. I hope they bring back his ""friend"" from time to time. And the other detectives add extra spice. The only problem is that the series is too short.  There should be 10 to 13 episodes, not 4 or 6. (I probably wouldn't be satisfied; I'd want more!)

4663095,5,B005DVIOIG,"This BBC production is notable for its excellent cast, knife-edge plotting and brutal depictions of crimes and depravity.  In particular, the two-episode arc of Idris Elba's Luther tracking Lee Ingleby's Cameron is at times gruesome and harrowing.  But the writing and staging is so perfectly executed, you can't look away.

There's nothing low-rent, contrived or cheap about 'Luther'.  It's first-class stuff all the way - cast, crew, writers, production.  It has the feel of a top-run motion picture.  The tight four-episode arc of Season 2 means there's not a moment to waste.  There's nary a single scene of throwaway fluff...or even of lighter material for the players (and its audience) to draw a breath.

For me, Season Two's standout is Aimee-Ffion Edwards as the young prostitute/slave Jenny.  Luther is compelled to rescue Jenny, thereby stepping into a devilish world of blackmail, backstabbing (or, more appropriate here, hand-stabbing) and violence.  Turns out 'rescuing' Jenny is fraught with blow-back.  And, as the danger and the stakes grow more dire, the relationship between Luther and Jenny deepens.  A highlight for me: given a small bit of light in her live, Jenny brings home a small gift for Luther.  Though it's brutally intercepted, it's revealed to be a framed photo of David Bowie performing.  I'd just read that Elba is a huge Bowie fan, so this little nod to his real-life likes thrilled me.

4663104,5,B005DVIOIG,"After my viewing of Season One (1) of this superb BBC murder/mystery/thriller, I had the very strong wish for yet another season and here we have Season two (2).  Season two (2) of ""Luther"" continues the excellence that the first season began.  My god, season two (2) is so well written, directed and so fabulously acted.

Although many of the ""support characters"" from Season one (1) are gone in Season two (2, the ""new crop"" of characters are really very, very good outstandingly helping Luther  (wonderfully and intently acted by Idris Elba) solve some really horrific cases that are filled with many nasty and frightening villains.  Luther, in his very brave and ""short fused"" manner, solves some really baffling cases in Season two (2) always putting himself in extremely dangerous positions.  He is really a very intuitive detective again in this season enduring some very cruel to himself situations while dealing with some intense personal ""demons"" of his own including his very strong attraction to Alice the  ""nemesis type"" character that he knows is a psychopath well capable of murder. (please note that Pam Ferris of ""Rosemary and Thyme"" makes a wonderful brief apperance in a sub-plot acting a very mean Madam/grandmother wonderfully until she is threatened with the wrath of Alice)

YES, my favorite character from Season One (1) is back in Season two (2) albeit shortly.  Luther's ""match"" and nemesis is shortly back and because of his strong attraction to her, she's back to drive him ""nuts"" and offer some temptation to get away from the ""madness"" and escape to more craziness with her.  Alice (acted brilliantly by Ruth Wilson) is in a mental institution in Season two (2) that she, of course, manages to escape from torturing Luther unmercifully.  Their scenes together are so very awesome--they truly ""ignite"" the screen.  I just love the characters of Alice and Luther that are so splendidly acted by Ruth Wilson and Idris Elba,  In fact,  all of the characters in Season two (2) are fantastically acted.  Of the ""new"" characters that I really adore is the assistant DCI to Luther that is acted greatly by Nikki Amuka-Bird--she is always questioning Luther's motives,

Although Season two (2) has only four episodes on two (2) discs, this season is really very good and I am very glad that my wish for another season came true because I was highly entertained by Season two (2).

4663107,5,B005DVIOIG,My husband and I just completed season 2.... And we loved it!  Our only regret is that there were only 4 episodes (boo). Luther doesn't disappoint - we were on the edge of our seats and we are so glad it ended the way it did because.........we're looking for so much more!  Keep up the good work.,1321142400,,296,4.175438596491228
4663108,3,B005DVIOIG,Disappointed there wasn't more of Luther.  We are used to much longer seasons in the United States.  The show though is 5 stars all the way.  I'd give it 10 if I could.  Idris Elba is perfect for this role- a morally challenged DCI trying to make it through the mess his divorce and ex-wife's subsequent death have left him in from season 1.  He knows what the right thing to do is- but it is not always the justice he feels compelled to see happen. And for Luther justice will win out no matter how it is served and what emotional price he pays.  Please bring back a 3rd season and give us a few more episodes.  A real fan was left wanting much more time spent w/Luther.,1320796800,2,671,4.155038759689923
4663109,5,B005DVIOIG,"luther, series 2 is another miniseries. In fact the first series wasn't that long. But bbc shows can alternate between a few episodes and 13 or even 20.  Most are 6 eps though and this one is a basically two stories told over 4 eps. Where Luthor battles crime and being blackmailed because he feels the need to battle evil. The show is excellent and sometimes rather way out there even!  But who cares you get a awesome lead actor and a fine supporting cast too. The dvd looks great as this is a 2011 miniseries. Like all bbc dvd's though this one is costly. The bbc could sell alot more dvds if they'd price them around 20.00! or less for these smaller series.  Oh well, this show should have had a fuller series , so for the two star reviewer , it is a series. That's the bbc for you.  A four episode series of a hit show!  It makes no sense, if you have a hit show then you SHOULD make more episodes of it, not do less episodes. BUt that is how they operate.",1320537600,,961,4.117647058823529
4663110,5,B005DVIOIG,"I loved the first run, with scary Alice and unpredictable alliances. The second series did not disappoint except that four episodes didn't seem like enough.  I hoping to see Luther in a season 3 soon!",1320105600,6,200,4.714285714285714
4663111,5,B005DVIOIG,"After seeing Season 1 of LUTHER, I couldn't wait for Season 2 to be on DVD. My only disappointment is that Season 2 is only 4 episodes long. This BBC series is so on the edge and so different than other police dramas that we need more LUTHER.

Idris Elba is a Class A actor. His portrayal of the honest and dedicated but deeply troubled DCI John Luther is remarkable. He is John Luther and the role seemed to have been made for him. We see some cast changes in Season 2...most notably the addition of Nikki Amuka-Bird as the young and idealistic DS Erin Gray. DS Justin Ripley is still Luther's number one fan and admirer. Ripley knows he can trust Luther's judgement no matter what as Gray begins to suspect Luther's honesty and motives.

Season 2 seems darker and more intense as we dig deeper into Luther's psyche. Season 1 dealt strongly with his relationship with his estranged wife and the relationship ended in tragedy. Luther is rebuilding his life and begins to wonder if being a cop is still his passion.

Although Ruth Wilson is back as the psycopath Alice Morgan, we don't see very much of her in Series 2. Alice Morgan is one of the most fascinating characters on television and her relationship with Luther was obsessive and bizarre. Only Alice seems to have some understanding of Luther's inner mind.

LUTHER is fresh and exciting. It's a few steps above other police detective series. Stories overlap in the 4 episodes mostly Luther's relationship with a very troubled Jenny Jones. Despite his misgivings, Luther heeds Jenny's mother's call for help. Now Luther has gotten himself very deep in a personal mess that could ruin his career and jeopardize the lives of others. His personal problems can't interfere with tracking down the latest criminal or killer. In the last episode, a strange killer suddenly attacks without warning..a twisted and unsual story.

This show is truly police drama at its best with top actors and amazingly crisp writer. I hope there will be a Season 3 and more episodes.",1320105600,2,2016,4.732193732193732
8467624,5,B005DVIOIG,Five stars no doubt...just wish they would have shown more detail from the last episode of season one in the first episode of season 2 but this is an awesome series!! If they would have picked up where they left off at the cliff hanger scene where they left off I would have loved it even more..a must see/ own series!!,1523318400,,319,4.245901639344262
8467625,5,B005DVIOIG,"Good show, its very entertaining. I wish they would kill off DS Gray though, she is an annoying little think i know it all. I won't go into anymore detail but, if you like shows about cops chasing down bad guys, give this one a chance. Luther has a heart of gold and sometimes a rough exterior.",1520035200,,294,4.175438596491228
