2648109,4,B000HXDTGW,"This movie starts out so slow you think you've definitely made a mistake by wasting your time watching it.  Just wait, it gets better.  The last half hour makes up for all the tedium you have to sit through to get to that point.  There is some really gushy gory parts that anyone who is a fan of blood and guts should enjoy.  You just have to wait for it.",1179100800,6,355,4.0285714285714285
2648110,4,B000HXDTGW,"this is a good horror flick, has good acting likable characters. It is violent and  grusome. Doesn't have a low budget look to it.",1173830400,5,130,4.416666666666667
2648111,5,B000HXDTGW,"This movie was refreshingly well done.  I saw the trailer for this online and it looked awesome, but you know how that can go.  To my pleasant surprise the 8th plague totally lived up to its trailer hype.  Now to be honest I may be looking at this a bit skewed because I watch a lot of b-horror movies (most of which are not so great), so that set the bar pretty low... That said, I was still genuinely creeped out and entertained with this flick.  It's hard not to be creeped out with all the grimy crap in that prison.  The blood action and scares were top notch for indie horror (even for bigger budget flicks really).  Not to mention we get treated to some obligitory prison sex they manged to sqeeze in with a pretty hot little gal getting down to her birthday suit.  I do thank them for that!  Overall this was a nice break from a lot of the other stuff out there with no budget and no production value... they definitely got the most bang for their bucks with above-par production values, acting, camera and lighting.  Top notch stuff for the horror heads.",1170806400,5,1063,4.328282828282828
2648112,4,B000HXDTGW,The filming was great; I attended the movie premier in Northern Virginia and was pleasantly surprised by the movie.  Some parts of the movie were somewhat predictable - as most horror flicks are - but it was wonderfully gruesome and fabulously frightening.,1168732800,6,256,5.095238095238095
2648113,4,B000HXDTGW,"The 8th Plague is a buckets-of-blood, no-holds-barred zombie fest.  With first-rate acting from Leslie Valenza, a moody atmosphere, excellent editing, and stunning visuals, the movie delivers on the promise of its chilling opening moments.  Horror fans will not be disappointed.",1167782400,11,278,5.925
2648114,5,B000HXDTGW,Production was awesome for an Indie and story line was interesting and as scary as any I have seen in recent times.  Great flick for anyone who likes great Horror Stories.,1161820800,8,171,4.516129032258065
2648115,3,B000HXDTGW,"Good production values and a number of fun scares.  For an Indie production, it's better than most.",1160611200,5,99,4.823529411764706
8142246,2,B000HXDTGW,"Not good. If this were a film student's project, then I would say it is great. But for a professional movie, it is bad. It's just a bunch of actors in bad makeup chasing one another around and grunting, with some fake gore. I mean, it's not the worst movie ever, but it is pretty bad, and certainly not worth spending money for.",1494547200,,328,4.222222222222222
8142247,1,B000HXDTGW,Nothing met my expectations. Not worth watching. Very bad acting. I wasted 45 minutes or my time on this. I kept it going in the hopes that the blood and gore would be worth it. If I could give it 0 stars I would.,1464393600,,213,3.8636363636363638
8142248,4,B000HXDTGW,"Perhaps fun is not the right word. Entertaining is better. I don't want to give the impression that this is one of those tongue in cheek, horror-coms. Not this movie. The movie looks like it was shot using VHS, soap opera type filming, but you get used to it after a while.  The acting is OK for what it is. At first, I was like, ""the female protag is going to kill it' but by the end, I deemed her ""not bad."" It doesn't take long to get ugly. The ugly is quite ugly. The story is interesting but nothing new and pretty straightforward. I am a bit of a sucker though for demonic/satanic themed flicks so it doesn't get old to me. The deaths are pretty gruesome. The ending was satisfying, though I predicted it. I also predicted the thing with the eyes. Overall, this was entertaining and I don't regret renting it. I would've liked to see it with a bigger budget. Like I said, I'm a sucker for these story lines.",1399248000,2,913,4.247126436781609
8142249,1,B000HXDTGW,"Watched about half of the movie--and I use the word ""movie"" loosely here--before I decided to commit suicide out of boredom.

Don't wast your money on this turkey.",1336694400,,163,4.821428571428571
8142250,3,B000HXDTGW,"There are some issues with The 8th Plague (2006), but the film does deliver some gruesome and shocking gore scenes that should satisfy horror fans with a taste for blood.  As evidenced here, and in his subsequent film Carver (2008), writer/director Franklin Guerrero Jr. has a flair for shooting horror.  Budgetary constraints are probably also a factor, but the 8th Plague suffers from not having a better written screenplay that ties events together more smoothly.  While the story still works, some rough edges keep it from being a much better film.

After her sister Nikki (Laura Chaves) turns up missing while on a camping trip, Launa Romero (Leslie Anne Valenza) gets her friend Crystal (Hollis McLachlan) and her boyfriend Gavin (Jonathan Rockett) to head up to Halcyon Ridge to search for her.  When they inform the local sheriff Jack Stiver (Paul Bugelski) that Nikki may have been exploring an abandoned prison, he assigns Buck (Terry Jernigan) a deputy to take the group up there to take a look around.  On the way, they pick up Mason (D.J. Perry) a former guard at the facility, and Curtis (Charles Edwin Powell) a drunk, who has a crazy story to tell about evil writings on the walls of the prison that takes people's souls.

The prison should have a road leading to it, but does not.  Instead the group has to walk through some woods to get there.  Entering the grounds, the group of five splits up, and in turn the evil present in the prison is unleashed.  Separating the group allows for different things to happen, and for thinning the heard.  The evil takes effect when a person reads the particular writing on the walls, which turns them into a red-eyed zombie-like killer.  The kills get messy when tools like an axe and a drill are employed, and the gore cranks up to a whole new level, when one character cuts out their own eyes.

The gore scenes are mostly well done with some really eerie imagery, and also some unnerving scenes related to the blind survivor.  Guerrero has a solid basic story, and he makes pretty good use of the prison location, however the action is spread out a bit, and some of the transitions between scenes don't quite fit.  Also the plot flow is disrupted at various times by nonsensical plot quirks and silly actions by the characters.  A little better focus, and more attention to detail in the writing, would have improved what is a pretty edgy thriller.

8142251,3,B000HXDTGW,"THIS IS AN INDIE HORROR MOVIE THAT HAS A VERY LOW BUDGET BUT IS STILL ABLE TO HOLD SOME HORROR REALITY TO IT. IT'S SLOW PACED AT FIRST BUT THEN AS THE MOVIE FINALLY GETS TO THE POINT IT'S A GREAT GORE FILLED FUN HORROR MOVIE THAT ENJOYS PLAYING WITH THE CAMERA.
THE LAST 40 MINS. OF THIS FILM IS TOP NOTCH HORROR. THE BLOOD, MAKEUP AND GORE MAKES THE FILM STAND OUT. WHAT IS ODD ABOUT THIS FILM IS I DON'T KNOW HOW TO CLASS IT, IS IT A MOVIE WITH DEMONS, OR A MOVIE WITH ZOMBIES OR IN THIS MOVIE MAYBE THEY ARE THE SAME.
TWO SISTERS LAUNA AND NIKKI ONCE A YEAR ALWAYS MEET TO PUT FLOWERS ON PARENTS GRAVE. NIKKI DOES NOT SHOW UP. LAUNA FINDS OUT HER SISTER WENT ON A CAMPING TRIP. SHE TAKES HER FRIENDS AND THEY HEAD OUT THE NEXT DAY IN SEARCH OF NIKKI BECAUSE SHE WOULD NEVER MISS THE YEARLY MEETING AT THE GRAVE.
THEY FIND THE EMPTY CAMP SITE. THEY GO AND REPORT NIKKI MISSING AND COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE LOCAL BUMPKIN SHERIFF AND POLICE OFFICER. THEY HEAD THE CREW OUT TO A LOCAL RUNDOWN JAIL NOT FAR FROM THE CAMP SITE IN HOPES TO FIND THE MISSING.  AFTER THEY ARRIVE AT THE JAIL IS WHEN THE MOVIE PICKS UP AND IS WORTHY OF WATCHING.
THE WHOLE JAIL ENDING AND FOREST SHOT WHICH RUNS ABOUT 30 TO 40 MINS. WHICH MAKES THE FILM WHAT IT IS. A WONDERFUL LOW BUDGET INDIE HORROR THAT IS ABLE TO CAPTURE THE WONDER OF A BIGGER BUDGET FILM. I GIVE MASSIVE PROPS TO THE MAKEUP PERSONS IN THIS FILM. THE DEATHS BY GUNS, AX, AND EATING ONE ANOTHER IS SO WELL FILMED THAT IT REMINDED ME OF A TRUE GREAT CLASSIC. YOU GET THE KICK A** HOT CHICK PLAYED WONDERFULLY BY LESLIE ANN VALENZA RUNNING AROUND COVERED IN SWEET RED BLOOD USING AN AX.
I AM A HUGE SUPPORTER OF INDIE HORROR, WITHOUT INDIE HORROR WE WOULD HAVE TO ENJOY TONS OF JAPANESE RE-MAKES OVER AND OVER, SO IF YOUR A HORROR FAN WE NEED TO SUPPORT INDIE HORROR FILM SO THAT THERE ARE SOME FILMS STILL MADE FOR THE HORROR FANS.
ITS DRAWN OUT THE WHOLE FIRST PART IS SLOW. THE ACTING IS REALLY HORRIBLE AT TIMES, AND THE STORY LEAVES A LOT OF HOLES. IF YOU GO INTO THIS MOVIE FOR A FUN FILLED HORROR GORE TIME THEN I THINK THIS FILM WORKS, BUT DON'T EXPECT SOME GRAND PICTURE.
SOME ARE GOING TO LIKE THIS AND OTHERS ARE GOING TO THINK IT'S A PIECE OF CRAP. I FOR ONE ENJOY THE LAST 30 TO 40 MINS. TO ME THAT ITSELF IS WORTH WATCHING THE PICTURE.
THE ONE AWESOME THING ABOUT THIS FLICK IS THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT OF DEMON/ZOMBIE IN THAT THE PLAGUE IS TRANSMITTED INTO YOU BY LOOKING AT A DRAWN IN BLOOD SYMBOL WRITTEN ON THE WALL.  THIS IS A GORY RIDE INTO THAT REALM OF HORROR HEAVEN FOR GORE WHORES.",1212796800,,2548,4.073705179282869
8142252,2,B000HXDTGW,"While I tried to like this film, I'm in agreement with those reviewers who didn't like it. It's tedious to sit and wait for something to happen. The supposed scares were lame, at best. I can't be as harsh on this film, as I have been on others, as it DID try to lend suspense to the proceedings, but it never gave anything that one would expect, by reading the back of the DVD case. There are other low budget horror films that deliver a whole lot more for the money.

In defense of this film however, ""The 8th Plague was a notch better than ""Monster"" (no, not the one with Charlize Theron, the other one, the one with tentacles on the DVD box).",1210377600,,645,4.201612903225806
8142253,1,B000HXDTGW,"I just don't get what all these people are talking about, ""Starts off slow, but it gets better"". What a load of crap. The only good thing about this movie is that it ended.. Poor acting..Horrible story..The gore was fake as f&%k..and the interview with the actors (was curious to see how embarrasing it was), was a joke..Avoid this movie at all costs..If you like  B movie horror, try out BORDERLAND or HIGH TENSION.
Also, I'm not a total pig, but I wanted to see some skin, the main character has a nice rack, but instead you get to see the ugly skinny girls tits.. But you hate her squeeks and over emphasized moaning so much, you really won't care.. THIS GETS MINUS 5 STARS.",1209772800,,677,4.416
8142254,2,B000HXDTGW,"Another low-budget horror movie, but a pretty decent one that makes good use of it's limited resources. As others have already pointed out, the film's biggest flaw is the pacing, which is way off and it takes forever to get going.

The story isn't too bad for a supernatural zombie movie and could probably be quite good with some extra work spent on it. Acting is wooden and stiff. All the characters seem to accept that flesh-eating zombies are all over the place without showing too much surprise or concern, but with all the zombie movies coming out these days, who can blame them?

The gore fx are acceptable, but nothing remarkable. I did smile at one of the characters when he stomped on a zombie skull Resident Evil-style, though. The ending when the two sisters met was probably intended to be tragic and emotional, but instead became comedic when one of them tried a little too hard to look like a zombie. :)

All in all, it's not a bad film, but there are much better ones around. This one is much too slow for it's own good.",1198886400,3,1036,4.470899470899471
8142255,5,B000HXDTGW,"excellent movie...plays more like a zombie movie...but extremly creepy movie..well worth the money,also very violent i would deff recomend this movie...well worth a buy",1184112000,3,168,6.041666666666667
