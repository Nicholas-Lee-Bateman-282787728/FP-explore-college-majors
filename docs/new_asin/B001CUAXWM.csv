8579138,5,B001CUAXWM,I loved to watch this back when the channel actually had history on it. This is one of the best documentaries on the Little Bighorn battle that Im aware of. All that has been documented is the Calvary side. But of course our side has never been told to the masses. Now I can show my classroom and children our side of the story.,1525996800,,328,4.140625
