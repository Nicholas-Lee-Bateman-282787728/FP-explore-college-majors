8153093,5,B000JU7YWS,"The highly intelligent and experienced Robert Mitchum chose to brilliantly portray the completeness of spiritual realities existing alongside the physical world, a unified wholeness shattered by those philosophically choosing empiricist reductionism. Accurately evoking the depths of meaning in ultimate issues, the film empowers liberation of those held captive to the purely physical, poor individuals enslaved in denial of the spiritual world. The film shows this well as one emotionally reactionary character, who had been irrationally shutting his heart to God because he experienced some suffering, grows into one who, as Jesus said, ""has eyes to see."" As Mitchum's character at one point foreshadowingly describes God's culturally adaptive ability to the modern context, we see the biblical chariot of fire that took the prophet Elijah to heaven movingly depicted with swelling parallelism. The film says that what you see with just your physical eyes is not all you get.",1417392000,,978,5.614864864864865
