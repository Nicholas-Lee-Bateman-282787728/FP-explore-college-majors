5092066,5,B007K4JV5E,"This is a message of joy to the world! Well researched, well presented, easy to follow. All the cases in the film are traceable, medically provable healings, unlike the common paid infomercials selling products.
This program does not sell you anything, it proves that there is a real choice to illness, once you just let your body to heal itself. It gives the most precious understanding that once we stop putting poisons (poisons form when we cook) into our bodies and give the body real nourishment in its natural unheated form, the body can heal almost any illness.
I bought and sold tens of the previous version of this DVD, and I am going to sell this new version even more. Every person on this planet needs to see this program and have this choice. I know what I am talking about, because I have been on 100% raw nutrition myself for 6 years now, and healed from a brain tumor, and my husband healed from leucemia.
Thank you, Valya for this marvelous work!",1333065600,12,963,4.540229885057471
5092067,5,B007K4JV5E,"It was because of the Boutenko family that I changed my diet and started incorporating GREEN SMOOTHIES into my life, thanks to the enormous love Victoria Boutenko has for her family's health and well being, her quest to heal her family's individual challenges is what inspired me  to follow this family's journey. The proof is in Victoria's children and how they have shared the wisdom instilled in them at a young age. Now they too are sharing with the world how simple it is too live a healthy, happy, dis-ease free way of life just by eating the fruits and vegetables of the earth. And it is so simple and delicious to do so....just listen to all these beautiful, amazing, miraculous testimonials in this wonderful documentary done so beautifully by Valya Boutenko, she cares about people, and is lovingly sharing with us all how we to can heal and live a natural, happy, active, healthy life.

5092068,5,B007K4JV5E,"Reversing the Irreversible

Valya's remake was well worth the while, as she has traveled the world gathering new testimonies ever more astonishing than the original. She offers the stories of eight different diabetics, and find out how the raw food diet helped them become balanced. We even watch as she chronicles a diabetic's response to a green smoothie cleanse- we see the blood sugar drop to healthy levels on her monitor. Then there are stories of weight normalizing, skin smoothing, blood pressure and cholesterol lowering, arthritis relieved, five cases of cancer healed, and more. My favorite was a seven year old girl whose lungs were clogged since birth with bronchiectasis, but can now sing and play like any other child. If this video doesn't inspire you and your loved ones to eat more raw vegan foods, I really don't know what will.",1332288000,4,847,4.964788732394366

8518606,5,B007K4JV5E,"Excellent job ! Sharing these kind of testimonies is always useful. So, don't worry, Valya, about the bad critics. We don't mind about the ""perfect"" technical aspect of this DVD... this is not the use of it ! Moreover nothing is perfect on this earth. I personally found it quite a success.",1458172800,,290,4.596153846153846

8518608,1,B007K4JV5E,"Dear Valya,

Next time you make a DVD, please hire a better director and a better cameraman. I believe and practice raw food diet but this DVD is a poor convincing to say the least!

A disappointed customer.",1387411200,2,207,4.421052631578948

8518611,4,B007K4JV5E,"Valya Boutenko does a great job encouraging ordinary people with challenging health problems to share their journeys with the rest of the world.  The DVD shows many people who quickly saw incredible results addressing illnesses while eating fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds, and most importantly, greens. Most doctors say these illnesses are incurable and only managable with strong pharmaceuticals. It's clear that raw food transforms the human body in ways you just can't imagine without trying it yourself. I only wish the DVD gave a bit more information about how to get started with such a lifestyle. I'm inspired, and encouraged to eat raw for my health.",1340064000,8,656,5.188679245283019
8518612,5,B007K4JV5E,"This DVD is a credit to the producers, it is full of life and full of hope . The testimonies are from folks who have had serious health challenges, the recipe for success is as simple as can be: start upping your greens in the form of smoothies.",1338076800,,245,4.125
8518613,4,B007K4JV5E,"This DVD is a wonderful and very inspiring documentary about the power of the human body to heal itself, provided it's given the right ""tools"" to do so. It's amazing (and yet so obvious when you really think about it!) to think that any ailment can be healed through raw foods. If people would only get back to the true 'diet' that humans are meant to eat, so many of the health issues plaguing this world would no longer exist.",1334620800,,428,4.3625
8518614,5,B007K4JV5E,"I had discovered the Raw Family recently while researching raw foods lifestyle.  Their name kept reappearing in so many of my searches and they were highly regarded by just about everyone.  Now I know why!  Seems that their mission, in addition to healing their own health issues, is to help others heal themselves.  This video is not a documentary in the normal documentary format, but it is incredibly inspiring!  The testimonials are downright amazing!  From healing something as ""simple"" as eczema to the most serious of diseases, cancer, it is really incredible. The people interviewed showed amazing courage and most actually glowed!  Who knew that simply listening to your body and giving it exactly what it needs could heal your ills and improve your life?!?!  I highly recommend that you watch this.  I am already sharing this with colleagues and friends.  I am joining the green smoothie revolution!",1334534400,4,909,5.081081081081081
