6821710,5,B00PULRH2S,"""DON'T LOOK NOW has more ideas in its first five minutes than most Hollywood movies have in their entirety."" -Steven Soderbergh

Ever seen POTEMKIN?  HIROSHIMA MON AMOUR?  THE SWEET HEREAFTER?  Even Stevie has got moves in the editing booth. Sorry--ahem--""Mary Ann Bernard"".

Isn't it sad how few movies actually utilize the resources film language provides in a way that entertains, inspires and gestures toward the sublime?  Hasn't ""slow"" cinema squandered the  potential of montage?  Are you not looking for something to drop your jaw and burrow into your unconscious?  Have you wondered if Donald Sutherland was ever not utterly sinister even when he's going for benign?  Wanna see Julie Christie's breasts and more?  Don't think old horror movies are scary enough?

Do you seek the Jungian horror film par excellence by the brashest Brit since Lindsay Anderson?  DON'T LOOK NOW.",1424131200,3,883,5.2214285714285715

6821712,5,B00PULRH2S,"Nicholas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now"" arrives on blu-ray from Criterion in a marvelous looking and sounding restoration of this classic suspense thriller. Controversial at the time of its release because of a fairly explicit sex scene, ""Don't Look Now"" jumps the boundaries of suspense thrillers focusing on the sense of loss and grief that a couple experience after a tragic situation and how it informs their relationship. I should warn you that, if you haven't seen the film, there is a risk the sex scene may make you a bit uncomfortable.

(SPOILERS: Based on a short story by Daphne Du Maurier, Roeg's film focuses on John and Laura Baxter (Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie)visiting Venice in the wake of tragedy--they lost their daughter. The couple encounter a psychic who warns them that John is in danger and must leave Venice. END OF SPOILERS)

Sutherland and Christie give marvleous performances and are completely convincing as John and Laura a couple who, seemingly, have reconnected after their loss.

The atmospheric thriller features stunning cinematography which adds to sense of foreboding.

As with most Criterion releases this edition spiffs up this classic film and features a truly stunning looking 4K transfer. Colors are terrific throughout and fine detail plentiful. The mono soundtrack presents the dialog clear throughout.

We get a 2002 short documentary on the making of the film featuring Roeg, editor Graeme Clifford and cinematographer Anthony Richmond where each addresses how they achieved a seamless translation of form with content.

""Nicholas Roeg: The Enigma of Film"" focuses on the director's style and approach to his material with comments from directors Danny Boyle and Steven Soderberg.

""Death in Venice"" gives composer Pino Donaggio his due by focusing on his creepy and atmospheric music score.

We also get a question and answer segment from 2003 featuring Roeg discussing the film as well as a new segment devoted to editor Clifford and hosted by film historian Bobbie O'Steen.

The best segment in my opinion is ""Something Interesting"" featuring Sutherland, Christie, Richmond and co-screenwriter Allan Scott on what attracted them to the project, its critical reaction and its place in history as a groundbreaking thriller.

Sadly, there isn't a commentary track and, while the essay by David Thompson is interesting, it's all too brief and facile in its discusson of the film. I also dislike the fact that it is on the back of a fold out poster with new artwork commissioned for this edition. I'd rather have the essay in a booklet format.

A stunning looking transfer, older segments focusing on the making of the film and a pair of new segments on the making of ""Don't Look Now"" make this blu-ray an essential purchase for fans.",1423699200,16,2780,5.128318584070796
6821713,5,B00PULRH2S,"Adapted from a story by Daphne Du Maurier, director Nicolas Roegs Dont Look Now (1973) is a stylish psychic and erotic thriller that endows the beautiful, albeit decaying, city of Venice with the aura of a haunted house.

A mad killer is on the loose, and a psychic not only tells them that she is in touch with their dead daughter, but also that Sutherlands life is in danger.

6821714,5,B00PULRH2S,"Once again, the wonderful folks at the Criterion Collection have outdone themselves. Their new digital restoration of Nicolas Roeg's 1973 film version of Daphne du Maurier's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Don-t-Look-Now/dp/1590172884/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Don't Look Now</a>&nbsp;is everything a fan like me could want. This moody horror film is #8 on the British Film Institute's official list of the Top 100 British Films of All Time. Watch it, and you'll see why.

A grieving British couple (Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie) come to Venice in the chilly off-season. Their young daughter has recently died in a drowning accident, and the architect husband's assignment--restoring an old Venetian church--seems a good excuse for them to leave England for a while as they recover from their loss. But there's a problem: the ghost of their dead child seems to have followed them there...

DON'T LOOK NOW is a hypnotic descent into the supernatural as only Daphne du Maurier and Nicolas Roeg could imagine it. Sutherland and Christie are excellent, and the production values are extraordinary, particularly Anthony Richmond's cinematography and Pino Donaggio's haunting musical score. The restored print on the new DVD is nicer than the 2002 Paramount DVD, with heightened color and better sound (I'm talking about the DVD--I haven't seen the Blu Ray version). The extras are good, too, including recent interviews with some of the people involved and a documentary about Nicolas Roeg. They even cleaned up the theatrical trailer. I love the Criterion Collection! Highly Recommended.",1423353600,29,1635,5.780082987551867
6821715,5,B00PULRH2S,"A masterpiece of cinematography and editing, Don't Look Now vastly improves upon the somewhat shallow short story by Daphne Du Maurier in creating a haunting cinematic poem of psychological fragmentation and fear.  The director Nicholas Roeg started as a cinematographer, and his visual expertise in this film creates a truly poetic imagery of anxiety and eeriness set in the off-season, cold, disturbing winter of Venice.  The images in this film will haunt any sensitive viewer for the rest of his or her life.  The ending is truly terrifying. The originality and inventive style of this film has not been equaled to this day.  There is a purely visual conception of images relating to each other  metaphorically and suggestively I have never seen in any other film.",1419120000,18,768,5.063492063492063

6821726,5,B00PULRH2S,"Beautifully photographed tale of terror in Venice. I first saw it at a late screening in NYC when it came out. Emerging from the theatre at one in the morning, I stood dazed and disoriented under the marquee lights, unsure where I was or what to do next. This is one creepily scary movie. And the Criterion blu Ray is a thing of beauty, as expected. Don't miss this one!",1462492800,,370,4.3
6821727,5,B00PULRH2S,"I have seen this film so long time ago and titally mesmerized and found all of the director's other movies right away and bought them as many as possible. Now it's been about 10 years and since I finally bought the bluray, I watched it again.
The picture quality was super shart and was more then HD feeling. But of course sadly it was mono sound. They didn't restored the sound into stereo.

The movie was famous for so many reasons but among them there are two. 1. The famous artistic love making scene 2. The surrealistic editing that has to do with telepathy and foreseeing ability of the father of the dead daugter and an old lady who sees the husband and daughter of the dead daughter who is also blind.

The scenary of the Italy is just malvelous and using the Wide Angle lense, it look so nervous and it totally fits to the horror film look that always made me so over the edge of the seat.

I knew briflely how beautiful Julie Christie but I felt it again through this movie even though she was already like in her early 40s or late 30s by then.
I can see why John Shcleginger worked so many times with her in his early years with her. She was truely a beauty, charming actress.

On the other hand, Donald Sutherland as always is acting like he've never acted like this before. He was a fragile, worrying sad person who is constantly thinks that one day his wife might hurt as his dead daughter which he foreseen her death by looking at the image through his glass with blood spreaded imgage when he was working at his study. He ran and ran to save her back then but she was dead inside the pond already.

I should talk about the editing. It was alway brief and surrealistic way that make the audience just so surprised and even though it was made back in 1973, it still feels like it is a 22th century film.

For isntance the love making sequence, when Donald is making love with his wife Julie, their love making shots are really realistic, but instead of showing them all together, he cuts back and forth to the other scene that both of them are wearing cloth back, looking at the mirror fixing their wordrobe to make sure they are fit perfectly. So we see them undress, making love & wearing cloth back at the same time. It is kind of unmatchable but if you see it it feels very artistic and understandable.
Reason for that? There is no reason I guess. Sometimes surrealistic things just have no reason. They are just arranged for art. We as an audience finds it and makes the reason. The critics make one and shouts out loud as if there is reason. What a bomb.

The music is always so soft and tender to show the husband and wife's love but when they are walking in the dark, when there are crisis they might be killed, the sharp knife like sound appears and that really hurt me although it is mono sound.

the camera work, zoon in is used really powerfully as scary way through the movie and it is unforgettable. You might know what I mean if you see this movie.

Again it is bluray and the picure quality is beyond belief. I was bless seeing this restored version.

This is a story about loss, love and death.",1461456000,7,3125,4.308347529812607
6821728,5,B00PULRH2S,"Don't Look Now is more than just the controversial (at the time) love scene. It's a smart, suspenseful and very psychological film. It was wonderful to hear that Criterion was making a version of it, so I bought this as soon as I could. I have rarely been disappointed in anything they have put out but this is actually one of their best. The cover art is beautiful and perfect at presenting the right amount of emotion covered in the film. The movie itself is well restored with actually quite interesting 'making of' features. The film is well worth buying just for itself, but if you are considering it, this is the version you should get. Criterion does it again.",1461110400,,667,4.566666666666666

6821741,4,B00PULRH2S,"""Don't Look Now"" (1973) is directed by Nicolas Roeg (Walkabout, The Man Who Fell to Earth). This is a horror movie about a British couple who go to Venice where John Baxter (Donald Sutherland) works to restore an old church. Through juxtapositions of shots depicting passages of time Roeg creates an intriguing maze of images that mirror the labyrinth of Venice's canals and the confusion that envelopes John Baxter as he seems to slip in and out of reality, imagining or seeing things that can't or shouldn't be real. This is a haunting tale about a slide into insanity.

This new digital 4K restoration of the film looks good though some of the cinematography seems out of focus and so lacks sharp detail at times. There are a lot of special features including a conversation with film historian Bobbie O'Steen, a 2002 documentary with the director, editor and cinematographer, an interview with the composer, as well as documentaries about the making of the film with interviews with the actors, and an essay by film critic David Thompson.",1435881600,,1042,4.887005649717514
6821742,5,B00PULRH2S,"How could you go wrong, here? Finally, we have got the Criterion's treatment to one of the most innovative, groundbreaking, atmospheric, intellectual, stunningly beautiful movies ever made. Julie Christie delivers another haunting, heartbreaking, poetic performance as tragic, and mysterious Laura Baxter, who's trying to recover in a wintry Venezia, Italy (splendidly photographed by Anthony B. Richmond), along with her stronger, stubborn, more logical, and yet ultimately most unfortunate husband (Donald Sutherland, in a then new, memorable look, presenting another ""out of time"" performance, as well!), after a series of mysterious tragedies, and wildly intersecting, more, and more troubling events are slowly fragmenting the life of this upper class, intellectual, gorgeous, evolved, affectingly in love, International couple, trying desperately to make sense of life, in a city (Venice) that is indeed supposed to be one of the most gorgeous, all over the World, but, that here, however and inexorably, it becomes slowly more and more intricate than a labyrinth of dark, and madding proportions.
What's there for me to add yet, that hasn't been said already, about this very personal masterpiece? I'd probably like to remind to everyone, and, if i may, especially, to all younger audiences, that the often overlooked, yet phenomenal director Nicolas Roeg, after years spent as a progressive, clever, outstanding, and truly inimitable top cinematographer (he had actually photographed several of Julie Christie's top 1960's hit movies, among them, the exceptional and eccentric, dark and romantic ""Petulia"" another true gem, and best movies of that decade, directed by Richard Lester in 1968 for Warner Bros. and which i highly recommend to all of those 'real great Cinema lovers', or to the counterculture's nostalgic crowd), here, after a stunningly memorable directing debut starring Mick Jagger, the dazzling film noir ""Performance"" co-directed, with another obscure, yet great filmmaker, Donald Cammell (his most famous, and recognized movie, remains MGM's ""Demon Seed"", also starring Julie Christie, and, still very timely and modern, if someone thinks it was shot back in 1977!) and, after shining at the helm of another much lower budget, exceptionally brilliant Australian venture of a movie called ""Walkabout"", too, here Roeg backed by Paramount, and, with an impeccable, strong script, inspired by a short novel of the same name, written by the great Daphne Du Maurier (Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"" and ""The Birds"", among other cult novels translated into greatly successful movies, i also highly recommend), he finally was directing with firm, and yet brilliantly groundbreaking, and shockingly, striking visionary moments, an unique, personal motion picture, and achievement, with no precedents, a complete new take (for 1973) on Horror,  but, also on romantic psychological dramas, featuring tremendously affecting performances, and mysteriously unexplainable events, shot with elegant flashback's, and flash forward's, to capture what lies between life and death, and perhaps..the shining.
I strongly recommend this movie to everyone today, and, provokingly, especially to all those just addicted to the never ending ordeal of tired, and tiring ""bubble gums"", CGI's action, or Marvel's blockbuster's movies, mostly made today, to, at least, have a good taste, or (hopefully) even appreciate what real filmmaking is truly about, and, why stars like Christie and Sutherland last forever, and should be watched with insightful attention, while they haunt your heart and soul in movies, such as this one.
The Criterion's restoration is formidable as usual, with, besides all the great work in order to restore the magnificent, dark colors of the original print, also featuring greater sound, so enhancing the beautiful, classic score from Italian musician Pino Donaggio, and, offers great short documentaries, and rare interviews, too, about the making of what remains one of the most atmospheric and, never exploitative (so do not expect easy scares, but, instead, many increasing, and, highly disturbing sequences, just deeply moving, and, so slowly affecting the viewers), accomplished films I personally ever watched, and re- watched again, and again, i don't even know how many times, while always finding more, and more precious unforgettable cues, and momentum, sense and sensibility.",1432339200,2,4402,5.649546827794562

This has always been a favorite film for me and I continue to get immersed in the visuals. The mood is of persistent dread and of a certain inevitability not understood all at once by the viewer similar to ""Vertigo"".

The transfer looks great and there are some interesting documentaries as you would expect from Criterion. Evidently Roeg wanted to cast Sutherland from the first and while he is decent, I have never thought he was a viable ""leading man"" actor. He and Christie at the time of the movie were both physically very slim and perhaps this body similarity was an important consideration.

6821753,5,B00PULRH2S,"This review is for the 2015 Criterion Two-DVD release of the 1973 UK horror classic, ""Don't Look Now"", which was directed by Nicolas Roeg, and stars Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland. The Criterion Collection has certainly outdone even themselves with this excellent presentation of this jewel in the crown of British Cinema. It is, indeed, a masterpiece of cinema that provides much for the heart, the mind, and the eye. After the death by drowning of their young daughter, Christine, John and Laura Baxter travel to Venice, where they encounter an elderly psychic who claims that she can see Christine's spirit. Initially, they are understandingly skeptical, but gradually through sessions with the psychic, they both begin to believe her because he begins to experience visions of his own, including a tiny figure wearing a red raincoat like Christine used to wear, appearing throughout the streets and alleys of Venice. The movie was adapted from a short story by Daphne du Maurier, and the cinematic achievement here created by director Roeg, cinematographer Anthony Richmond, which is brilliantly disturbing and haunting, and the very creepy musical score by Pino Donaggio, all combine to provide the viewer with an unforgettable experience which stays with one long after the final credits end the film. Both Christie and Sutherland are excellent in their roles, while director Roeg is certainly at the top of his game. The infamous sex scene between the two leads is quite visually stimulating, to say the least. This 4k digital restoration makes the 2002 Paramount DVD print look like a public domain copy. I won't give away the ending other than to say when I first saw this film in 1973, I was hauntingly disturbed for a number of days after. In addition, the film includes some purely visual connections which are connected to each other metaphorically, as well as done in a very effective subliminal manner which adds to the final terrifying climax. The subject of parapsychology allows Roeg to explore intricate reflections on precognition and fate, and are both allied with a heartbreaking study of loss, itself. The extras on the 2nd disc are all excellent, as well. My favorites would include ""Death In Venice"", a 2006 interview with composer Pino Donaggio, ""Something Interesting"", a new piece on the writing and making of the film, featuring recent interviews with Richmond, actors Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland, and coscreenwriter Allan Scott, and ""Nicolas Roeg: The Enigma Of Film"", a new piece on Roeg's unique style, featuring interviews with contemporary filmmakers Danny Boyle and Steven Soderbergh.

""Don't Look Now"" is based on an equally chilling short story by Daphne du Maurier, who gave us the novel ""Rebecca"" and another short story you may know from a movie made by someone named Hitchcock: ""The Birds."" Du Maurier was not a bit pleased by what Hitch did to ""The Birds""; it is said that she was much happier with Nicholas Roeg's version of ""Don't Look Now."" In truth, it is a much more faithful cinematic adaptation. This is a mood (and moody) piece: with one conspicuous exception there is no real shock (although that exception is a dilly). Instead, Roeg creates an off-kilter world that begins in a grey Britain, then quickly moves to a moldier Italy. The production design, cinematography, and music are blended to give one a feeling of creeping but indefinable menace: a dream that begins in grief, gets weirder by degrees, veers into the inexplicable, then turns into a nightmare in which most of the pieces finally fall into place. On first viewing you're on a mysterious journey; on repeated viewings you appreciate just how clever the scenarist and director have been in dropping clues that you couldn't recognize as such until after the fact. I'm being deliberately vague, because to spoil this movie by disclosing too much information would ruin it for a first-time viewer.

Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie deliver realistic performances as a married couple that have suffered terrible loss, trying to find their footing together and independently of each other. In less skillful hands the performances could have become awfully melodramatic, but Sutherland and Christie are too talented for that. It's no spoiler to report that this movie presents one of the most realistic scenes of voracious sex in cinematic history. In a fine interview featured among the extras, Sutherland disabuses us of believing that the actors were doing anything more than acting. I believe him (I think).

I owned this movie on DVD before upgrading to Criterion's Blu-ray. It was a sound investment. The audio is far more improved, and the image quality is astonishingly better. Much of the film is shot at night in a misty or befogged Venice. On regular DVD the picture is a soupy murk. Here it is so textured that I almost felt the chill. The usual cache of Criterion extras are entertaining and informative. In spite of the movie's titlewhich turns out to be ironic  in multiple waysmost viewers will find it hard to look away from this haunting film.",1507420800,3,2594,4.942660550458716

8689226,3,B00PULRH2S,"The movie is moody, gorgeous, and terrific, but there are so many different accents (Scottish English, British English, American English, and  Italian), not to mention entire untranslated sentences in Italian and audio pickups that are more arty than audible, that it really cries out for subtitles.  With subtitles I would give it five stars.",1501459200,,343,5.333333333333333
