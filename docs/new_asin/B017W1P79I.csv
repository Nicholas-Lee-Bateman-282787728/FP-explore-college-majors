7534236,4,B017W1P79I,"""Chi-raq"" (2015 release; 118 min.) brings the story of gang violence in Chicago's south side. As the movie opens, we get Nick Cannon's ""Pray 4 My City"" playing on the screen, with nothing but the lyrics showing on the screen. After that, still more sobering info: stats showing the number of murders (7,356) in Chicago during 2001-2015 being higher than the number of casualties in the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan. When we finally get to the story at hand, we get to know Chi-raq (played by Nick Gannon), a rapper and also part of one of the local gangs, and his girlfriend Lysistrata (played by Teyonah Parris). It's not before long that a young girl is killed by a stray bullet, leading from an outcry of the community. The woman decide to withhold sex from their men until an end to the street violence is reached. Will they succeed? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest Spike Lee joint, and it is also the first movie in theaters from Amazon Studios (yes, THAT Amazon). The movie is said to be a modern day adaptation of the ancient Greek play ""Lysistrata"" by Aristophanes. How many of you have read or seen that play? I know I haven't, so I have no idea how closely the movie comes, in concept, spirit or otherwise, to the original Greek play. Much (but not all) of the movie's dialogue is indeed in verse, but it is done very loosely and if you didn't pay particular attention, you wouldn't even notice. The movie's lynch point is the funeral of the little girl, during which the minister (played by John Cusack) gives a thundering eulogy, condemning both the violence and the underlying societal problems (poverty, etc.). Samuel L. Jackson's character (Dolmedes) is the 'host' of the movie, providing biting commentary between scenes. Teyonah Parris, who broke through in last year's ""Dear White People"", plays a confident lead role and is the emotional centerpiece of the movie. Wesley Snipes, Angela Bassett and Jennifer Hudson all perform very nicely as well. But I have to say that Cusack's role as the white minister in an all-black church and community is the most shocking (if that is the right word) of all. The movie features plenty of great music, including performances from Nick Gannon, R. Kelly, Mail Music, and, surprisingly, Bruce Hornsby, among others. In all, I was pleasantly surprised with ""Chi-raq"", which is strong and cohesive, and easily Spike Lee's best work in YEARS (for my anyway).

The movie opened nationally this weekend. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at in a huge theater was attended dismally (I counted 5 people, including myself), much to my surprise and somewhat dismay. Sure, this isn't the easiest or most accessible movie, but the movie makes a lot of valid points, and is frankly a darn good movie. Maybe this will find a second life when streaming or eventually getting a DVD/Blu-ray release. Meanwhile, ""Chi-raq"" is definitely worth checking out!",1449360000,29,3032,4.795411089866157

7534273,5,B017W1P79I,"A lot of the low ratings here seem to miss the fact that this is depiction of a Greek play. Aristophanes was known for his comedy in his plays. Maybe people need to educate themselves on these things first, instead of writing low rated reviews about how they didn't get it because that's more on you than the film lol.

The film had no lack of serious but also comedic elements. Very highly enjoyable, and it's clear what the message was. I just wish they talked a bit more about how White America contributes to these issues, but overall a well made film. The writing was great, it was cool to see a rap take on a Greek play. Music was apt, good lyrics too. Was weird to see Nick Cannon of all people as a gangster, but he played the part amazingly. Teyonah Parris was wonderful as Lysistrata, because she a strong actor and nice for the role, and it made me want to see more of her films. Samuel L. Jackson was perfect as Dolmedes, I really couldn't picture anyone else for that role. Ultimately a very fun film to watch and it was interesting to see a somewhat absurdist perspective on a serious topic. The last point of including ""Wake Up"" at the end is very much needed for this nation to understand what these communities are going through. However, it's definitely a kind of a comedic take on it rather than explaining it properly, so don't take it so seriously. The social justice message was well made though, and it gave me a lot to think about. Highly recommend just for Spike Lee, but it's well worth it to watch for the others in the film and for how awesome it is.",1516147200,2,1578,4.331081081081081

7534276,3,B017W1P79I,"At the start I wasn't feeling this film, mostly because its message got drowned out by the pornographic storyline: withholding sex to achieve social awareness.  Was Spike's reason for serving us this storyline some kind of hint?  Whatever the case, the acting was very good, even compelling, mostly because I believe that all the participants were really, genuinely feeling Black Chicago's pain, and this came out in their performances.  However, I would be hesitant to show this in a grade or middle school, environments in which too many young sisters and brothers begin to feel pressured or/and even coerced into gang life.  Perhaps Spike can make an anti-gang movie just for them.",1514937600,,684,5.080357142857143

It's not just the weak characters, uninspired story, Nick Cannon's rap voice or the fact that Rudy Ray Moore blows Samuel Jackson out
of the water (playing Dolamite or something like that)...

It's the really desperate attempt to make anyone like anything about this movie.

I've listened to Spike on many different occasions in the media, and Spike just doesn't get it. If you commit the crime, you serve the time. I know Spike doesn't like that statement. That should be enough of a deterrent to end gun violence. There are harsh realities in life, but I don't think Spike lives in reality. The state doesn't incarcerate people without a reason and a trial. In his delusional mind, he thinks that black men can be controlled by the power of the p----y. Really shallow and insulting. Fear is always the best option to scare young people into staying on the straight and narrow. The sad part I think Spike actually thinks his strategy will work to curb gun violence.

7534311,5,B017W1P79I,"I initially didn't want to this movie when it first came out because at the time, and currently, there was too much bloodshed in the city in which it was set to make a darn movie about it.

It took a few months, and I watched it with an open mind. It was amazing! This movie tells a story that is so blatantly true, that I find it hard to believe that the actors wanted to recite certain lines, as it's hard to find black people in real life to say such things about themselves, because it brings up accountability, which black America fails to address every Civil Rights movement they've had in the past century.

This movie brings together all elements that create a solution for black America'sconstant plight for structure and discipline: accountability. Though Spike Lee was sarcastic about at in the end of the movie, accountability is important to save America and the world time and resource having sympathy for the past, which no longer exists and allowing black America to constantly look outside themselves for solutions when all of the dysfunction is indeed, within the community due to a value system that is fiercely protected by the community itself.",1502409600,,1165,4.733990147783251

Since the early 2000s there have been protests and constant complaint about the war but mainstream media does not accurately portray what is happening in our country.  Black lives matter is portrayed as a racists 'black panther murder squad' in the media which makes it difficult to understand what is actually happening.

The parallels between the Ancient Greek comedy play and the movie are loose but the original effort receives nods throughout. However, while CHI-RAQ has comedic elements, it is by no means a comedy. It undertakes an extremely serious subject of gang inner city violence and the rising rates of innocent bystander casualties that accompany said violence. Spike Lee lures you in with humor, grips you with good acting, and keeps you in with a message that is firmly rooted in a shocking reality.

Nick Cannon is a revelation as ""Chi-Raq"", the protagonist's love interest/adversary. Samuel L. Jackson is spot on with his running zingy commentary and a commanding yet nonchalant presence which has become kind of his trademark.  Angela Bassett is a spectacular powerhouse . The rest of the performances are noteworthy as well. And even though I am by no means a John Cusack fan, he delivers one of the most moving speeches of the movie.

All-in-all, this one is definitely well worth your time. This stylized entertaining drama will not start a riot, but it will sure make you think.",1487894400,,1237,4.909090909090909

If these were separated into two movies or perhaps lessened on the sex jokes; I would have enjoyed the movies more. The cast is beautifully picked in large. Angela Bassett as Miss Helen was perhaps my most favorite character who correctly characterized a long-grieving mother who just wants the violence. Jennifer Hudson as a grieving Irene was heartbreaking, particularly when she was cleaning off her daughter's blood off the street. However, I would say that Wesley Snipes as the Cyclops was not needed which defeats the purpose of the movie about gang rivalry. Also, John Cusack as Father Corridan seemed out of place and slightly creepy which isn't a combination for the pastor.
  In all, I felt that the jokes as satire overpowered the issue that the movie faced with gang violence and death and how this is an attempt to portray Chicago. Personally; I felt despite being a satire film; it slightly insults the people of Chicago and the victims and their families.",1484352000,3,1125,4.947089947089947

I commend and support Spike Lee for making an effort to bring this important issue to the big screen but note the focus should have been on the catastrophic impact this issue has on not only people of color in this nation but on the world's depiction of this country and should have provided recommendations for/more guidance re: resolutions.

The dialogue is often really heavy-handed, also, and sometimes just plain absurd, especially when the characters speak in heavily contrived rhymed couplets.

I tell people all the time you can't have it both ways, if you want people to not live on welfare they need a job that provides a living wage. Okay off my soapbox. The remake of this Greek play was great. the actors were believable and the story is relevant to what is going on today. It gave both sides of the issue; Black on Black violence and police brutality.

Combining music, dialog in rhyme, over-the-top characters acting more like characters from a medieval morality play than real persons, and some ham-fisted politicizing and polemics, Lee's work has to be taken for what it is or not at all, and demands more focused attention than most any film you might come across. The dialog is crammed with poetic flourishes, mostly in rhyme, and it's hard to say whether it's really ""deep"" or just portentous. It's an updating of Aristophanes' ""Lysistrata"" set in modern Southside Chicago (Chi-raq suggesting it's more like Iraq than a civilized city), so much pays homage to the Greek playwright's style. The plot? Upset about gun violence between rival gangs that causes the deaths of many innocents, the mistress of one gang leader follows the Greek method of getting the guys to give up the guns... ""No peace, no pussy""... and convinces the other women to join the protest until the men surrender. Aristophanes was funnier.",1472428800,,1003,5.048192771084337

I was turned off by the whole black-on-black crime thing at the very beginning of the movie because that argument is often used to distract from the need to address racism. However, the need to stop police violence was addressed briefly during the part on the roof, and I approved of this. I seriously wish they did not have a white preacher preaching at all the black people about the problems in their community--Black people already know this and don't need white people preaching at them--I don't care if the preacher is based on a real person. It was also really hard to tell whether this movie is a drama or a comedy--it started out as a drama and very powerful and then later turned into some really strange musical stuff, very different from the tone I thought the movie would take.

It's almost like this is a School Daze anniversary piece, except without the freshness that movie had.

The problem of violence in Chicago is very real and that city, unfortunately, has earned its ""Chi-Raq"" moniker honestly. More focus on the tragedy of inner city violence and less on ""no peace, no pussy"" could have made this a powerful companion to the discussion of gun violence  in which we are currently  engaged. The satire gets a little too silly at times to be taken as a significant comment on our violent society, and tengaged missed opportunity.

It's one of those movies you need to let wash over you since it's as subtle as a sledgehammer from the first frame and straight up bizarre in the execution of its central war of the sexes story. But if you let yourself get lost in it, it's incredibly entertaining. It's absolutely not the movie I was expecting and I say that in a good way. It's not perfect, however. Spike shot for the moon and missed, but the effort is certainly apparent. I also didn't expect to laugh so much. I don't want to spoil it, but fans of The Wire are in for a hilarious surprise. Also Wizard of Oz fans. You'll know it when it happens and crack up.

The story is framed around the contentious Black Lives Matter movement in America, which I frankly think is doing a lot more harm than good at this point as the months roll on and the protests/rallies are getting more heated and violent.

With delicious anticipation, the first scene of people chanting ""Chi-raq"" was colorful, exciting, and dramatic. Also a fan of Shakespeare, as characters spoke in couplets, the film promised to have my interests delightfully displayed. Within five minutes the disappointment at many of my favorite actors like Jennifer Hudson, Angela Bassett, John Cusack, Wesley Snipes and Samuel L. Jackson all in one film and being bored out of my gourd, annoyed by the phoniness and pretentiousness of the presentation for me, guilt and shame that such a vitally important topical subject was unwatchable for me, and confusion as to why a great director, superb actors, relevant story and setting left me cold set in.

7534988,3,B017W1P79I,"It did have a good message about stopping the violence and the hate. However it would be nice if they at least said one line about standing up to the maltreatment of women. They show cheating and still going back to the dude, and talk about being burned with cigarettes and feel the pressure to have to have sex with their dude all the time or else they'll be dumped and they never talk about standing up in general for themselves and not accepting maltreatment from men.

They definitely used sex images to sell the movie, which again a bit of a deterrent for me if you're trying to show strong women and yet also showing normalized degradation of them. It kind of made it seem like women are powerless without sex appeal, and even with it they generally accept that as the only thing holding men to them.. So they got it partially right, and did have some really solid and strong points about gang violence.

Overall worth a watch and I dig that women come together to fix a problem that is terrorizing their community.",1467417600,,1021,4.454545454545454

However, Chi-raq is a great example of how he both appreciates the traditional dramatic artform and wants to make a statement. In some ways it reminds me of School Daze, but I was just a kid when I saw it. As an adult, it reminds me of many great moderistic interpretations of Shakespeare, and I lament that there aren't more contemporary Classical adaptations out there. Call me lazy, but I not a Humanist...Just a Scientist who appreciates stylized traditional drama without paying theater prices. Was the satire logical or precise? No! But, it was beautifully and entertainingly executed. Nick  Cannon and Wesley Snipes impressed me so much that I needed IMDB to confirm who they were. Teyona Parrish always looks and acts differently in everything I've seen her in (which is kudos enough).

As far as Spike Lee fans go, I think people who lean heavily towards: She's Gotta Have It, School Daze, Girl 6, and maybe Son of Sam will appreciate it.",1466380800,,1004,4.8313953488372094

His whole career is based on forcing us to see ourselves. The good & the bad. Things worth celebrating & things cringe worthy. I will always be a fan of his work. John Cusack & Westley Snipes! They were awesome! Teyonah Parris should have move major leads in Hollywood. She's a feast for the eyes. I really appreciate how her character was portrayed. She wasn't just some ""hood girl"" stereotype, she wanted change for her community & she meant buisness. I was happy to see Dave Chappelle too! I hope more people give this movie a chance.

He really tries hard to get the message out about black on black crime and the gun violence epidemic in Chicago and many other cities across the United States. It gets a little preachy at times.

It's not for everyone but if you like Lee's films and you're really looking for something different in film, then this is a great film to watch. It's a violent film and it's sexual but there is also great humor and emotion. This is not a film that you could show in a high school or junior high without approval.

incorporated CHI-RAQ into the social concious of your local community through churches, yardsales, park and planning services, open gatherings? Introduce CHI-RAQ into our education systems through local government petitions and lobbying....

My point is I found this movie to be a... sheesh a MOVEMENT... socially and most importantly EMOTIONALLY.

I also found weight in Dave Chapelle (among so many others) choosing to be in this film, I've heard and read about his fall from stardom after his show on comedy central aired, and really pay attention to the media he does chose to do. The fact we see him in  THIS means a lot to me and anyone who appreciates Dave Chappelle motivations and moves in his current career.

I'm sympathetic to the subject matter so there is my bias, but, if you can get past the quirkiness of spike lee (which can off-put many but I find TRULY ENTERTAINING) and really evaluate what you don't necessarily understand this movie has all the potential to really shake your current social foundations.

anyway thanks for reading my lil review of the movie

7535183,4,B017W1P79I,"A powerful story grown from the reality of gun violence and gangs in Chicago, Kevin Wilmott and Spike Lee use Aristophanes' ancient play Lysistrata to imagine how women can stop the murders of their children --more children in Chicago dead of gun violence than Americans killed in two wars, Iraq and Afghanistan, over the same amount of time. The language is raw, the acting effective, the minor characters real women affected by this scourge of guns and gangs. Ironically the woman who plays Lysistrata is invisible on the credits that show up when you see this film option on your Amazon screen. Brilliantly conceived, cleverly staged, and deeply disturbing when one looks below the glamor and sexy good looks of the characters. This madness must stop and Wilmott and Lee help us see that in Chi-Raq.",1461283200,,802,4.904411764705882

I loved the poetry of this film and the music was brilliant. The opening rap by Nick Cannon was a great opening for the film.  The twist of old and new was brilliant.  Spike Lee tells wonderful stories and he takes Aristophanes' play and wraps it around modern day Chicago in a poignant vision of Blacks killing Blacks.  Lee also makes a commentary on everyday people caught between gangs and police.  He shows the political complication of the gun lobby and how everyday people are caught in the crossfire.

I admit first that I am biased.  I love retelling of stories, I have a strong classical background and I am familiar with multiple of Spike Lee's Joints.  The verse was lovely the acting was superb. Use of song and dance breaks are common in Spike Lee movies so I was unsurprising.  I appreciated the fact that most of the elements that are causing strife in the Black Community: gun violence, police violence, the police to prison pipeline, lack of educational opportunity, Inaccessible health care, lack of jobs and economic opportunity as well as the government endorsement of these things. To those who say it is all over the place - truthfully these are just the things Black America deals with on a daily basis.  Not everything at once, but often parts each day. The church is a common place of meeting and interaction in the Black Community.  I did not see this as relying on god, but a way to mobilize a part of the community who still has a home base in the church.  I was astounded by John Cusack in this role which he played well. I appreciated the verse and the way it was intertwined with present day characters. There were many elements that held to the original story.  For me the  ending ""competition"" fell a little flat, but the original play just ended with a distracting woman named ""reconciliation,"" who distracted the generals while they signed a peace treaty.  so I suppose I can forgive that.  I felt the two main characters were well flushed out and even some of the side characters were show to have some depth.  I feel this is definitely a worthwhile watch and may need a second watch to really get the details.",1459382400,,1786,4.578616352201258
7535246,4,B017W1P79I,"I thought it was different, creative and had an innovative way of showing how to get to the solution of less violence in Chicago. I really valued seeing that. Too many times we see the same kinds of movies on repeat, that are predictable and don't favor new ideas but are just recycled information-- but this one was unique, fierce and strong in its own right and presented a new solution to ever-increasing violence in Chicago specifically. It showed how powerful women could be for the good and that's why I gave it 4 stars. It was a positive film that showed black women in their true nature--strong, promoting life, planning for how to put an end to whats wrong in the world, raising the consciousness amongst ourselves and the world and owning that power. This is who we really are when we are conscious. And that, I can appreciate.",1459382400,2,837,4.586666666666667

Because the satire focused on the gang violence, I feel like the film did not depict the streets of Chicago properly. I was born in VA, and I'm a military brat who's lived all over. My dad's side of the family is from Chicago. My sisters and brother grew up there and the streets raised them. The streets were also the cause of my brother's death.

Although Spike Lee included and showcased violence and the repercussions of living the street life, bangin for your set and goin hard to live the live, he made it a SATIRICAL film. There's NOTHING about the streets of Chicago that is funny or made to be a mockery. It was very disrespectful to me, and I'm not even from the hood! He made light of what really goes on in order to make the movie mainstream instead of telling the REAL STORY about the streets of Chicago.

I'm very disappointed by the movie and the fact that as a man placed in the position to tell the truth or raise awareness about the deaths of his people from violence, Spike Lee failed the people. He failed his black community.",1459209600,,1119,4.375

7535459,3,B017W1P79I,An okay film,1458777600,,12,3.3333333333333335
7535460,1,B017W1P79I,"Chiraq is a film that debuted on December 4th, 2015.  The film is directed by revered director Spike Lee, an outspoken film-maker who actively targets racial relations involving Black-Americans. Lees movie is focused on the overall destruction of Chicagos urban communities through gang violence by invoking the philosopher Aristophanes play Lysistrata.  Lysistrata is a comedy that tells a comic account of a womans extraordinary mission to end the Peloponnesian War by denying sexual advances from their lovers.  Spike Lee heavily borrows from this tale, even going so far as to name the main character of Chiraq Lysistrata.  Lee places heavy emphasis on one particular scene in which a seven-year-old child was killed by a stray bullet, leading to a community-led idea of promoting peace in these violence laden neighborhoods. While Chiraq delivers in recreating a modern Lysistrata, it fails to deliver a resounding message to empower the Black-American community.

 Chiraq at times, is an influential film, especially at moments where it reveals the disaster rampant gun violence has caused in Chicago alone. When Lee is able to make these points, the film becomes very inspirational as well as informative.  Specifically, when actor John Cusack (playing the role of a priest) delivers a moving message about the unavailability of resources lower income families face helps to convey the need for assistance for these communities.  By utilizing the reality that lower income families have lesser opportunities to succeed will no doubt open the eyes of people who deny this fact, or reassure the claims of the people who are looking to decrease the poverty gap.  However, while Spike Lee utilizes such methods to convey his message, these moments are not frequent enough to make the rest of the film meaningful.  Consequently, while I find Chiraq to have some interesting points to it, I feel that Lee loses the audience when he talks about womans empowerment and sexuality over gun violence and drugs.

 A short coming of the film is when Chiraq isn't talking about the plethora of gun violence in Chicago, it ends up talking about sex.  Thats right, a movie based on the terrors of south side Chicago, notorious for gang violence and drug trade, focuses on sex.  At one point in the film, main characters Chiraq and Lysistrata engage in a showdown, neither of words nor violence, but a sex showdown.  Spike Lee creates the notion that, if all women globally renounced sex and denied all men, world peace would follow.  At first I found this to be comical, like Aristophanes intended it to be, however I believe Spike Lee takes Aristophanes notion rather seriously and quite literally employs the usage of celibacy for peace.  In another instance, the women succeed in capturing a military armory by means of sensual seduction and when faced by the response of the police overtly chant, No Peace, No P***y.  Spike Lee began this film with statistics and realistic notions about how lower income families face a growing trend of rejection from politicians and lesser opportunities, and instead chose to implore all the women to promote sexual celibacy to cause their men to have a cathartic reaction and abstain from violence.  Although these parts are often hilarious, I often found myself questioning the seriousness of these scenes and repeatedly I was left bewildered if this movie was looking to be informative or a dramatic comedy.

Chiraq expects audiences to be well-versed in the humanities, while also forcing the audience to take Lees views on current events as facts, truth be damned.  However, there are simply too many instances where Lees emphasis on the comical points of Lysistratas denial of sex as a focal point for the film.  At one point in the film where the characters are discussing how they are going to go about denying their significant other access to their bodies, one character announces, Well, what about the thots?  And I too announced, yes, what about the thots?  Initially Lysistrata states that shell go ahead and recruit them as well, but in reality there is no such culpability. Regardless of what your goal is or how persuasive you may be, there will always someone who does not care about your ideals, no matter how righteous you are. I give Spike Lee credit for attempting to make the film Chiraq an eye opener, however I feel that he has missed a great opportunity to bring to light the poverty lower income families, especially Black-Americans, face and the racial tension that heavily influences this detriment. If Spike Lees goal was to make a modernization of Aristophanes Lysistrata the dramatic comedy, he has done justice, if he meant it to be a serious critique of the City of Chicago and revealing means of ending gun crime, he may need to reconsider his profession.

 According to critic Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times, Chiraq isn't a broad comedy nor a gratuitous slam at our city of Chicago, and instead is a thunderous wake-up alarm to resolve our gang violence and save our city. While I agree that Spike Lees film has delivered a powerful message and has utilized parts of his film to instill a sense of community, he has failed to deliver the means to follow through.  In another point of his review, Roeper states how the global-wide sex strike is ludicrous, but the reality of young men shooting one another over gang colors and turf wars as equally ridiculous.  While this statement is true, I do not agree that this justifies Spike Lees inclusion of this ridiculous idea that a sex strike would lead to peace.  If Spike Lees goal of this movie was to get the topic started on gang violence, in the first thirty minutes of the movie he has succeeded, however it quickly divulged into a topic of why is there so much sex? became paramount throughout the rest.

 Conclusively, I can only recommend this film to people who are well versed in the humanities and can understand the several niche references Spike Lee creates in order to fully grasp the concept of Chiraq. I would also recommend that if anyone who intends on watching Chiraq to also review the play Lysistrata by Aristophanes, and several older Greek mythologies such as Oedipus, as Chiraq is a direct modernization of this play.  Anyone who has a lesser knowledge of Greek mythologies and plays, will question why Samuel L. Jackson is dressed in a pimp suit and often yells at the audience, or why the women constantly yell No Peace, No P***y, and undoubtedly question Spike Lees touch on film-making.",1458777600,,6536,4.924408014571949

7535464,1,B017W1P79I,"Interesting movie but I feel like this should have and could have been so much more.  It was mostly a movie based around the theme that the solution to the violence in Chicago is for women to withhold sex from gang-bangers.  I know its meant to be a cutsy/comical device for a movie, but ultimately it just gets embarrassing how much it is emphasized that men and women can't control themselves and live without sex.  I feel embarrassed for the people who watch this and find it to be an appealing solution to such a serious problem.  Then to make it worse, the movie quickly throws in some scenes promoting a political agenda based around banning guns and socialism being the answer to the violence.  They even threw in a zinger putting down Ben Carson, who is someone they should be praising!  Carson grew up with a single mother in the hood and took responsibility to educate himself by reading voraciously and made himself to be a wildly successful doctor!  Why not celebrate someone like that who took responsibility for rising above the chaos and violence of the streets, instead of suggesting the government will just ""guarantee everyone has a job!""?
All in all, not so subtle political undertones ruined this movie along with the depiction that gangsters would stop something as serious as killing a child for something as trivial as having sex.  Pretty lame, shoulda been a lot better all around!  Its pretty sad that politics pervades all media....kinda seems like brainwashing.",1458691200,3,1488,4.826771653543307

While there are some important themes in this movie, like how high poverty rate, high unemployment, and marginalizing a certain subset of people can lead to high rates of criminal and gang activity, it mixes the message from a comical standpoint. The fact that they were speaking in prose (poetic prose) threw me for a bit. But I am familiar with ancient tragic plays so I understand the connection to classic greek comedy and the significance of teh ""Spartans and the Trojans"". I encourage those who are on the fence about this movie to give it a try with an open mind. I think this will eventually be a cult classic.

Their performances were outstanding!  The supporting cast pretty good as well.  I watched this movie with an open mind and despite all of the controversy I was keen to see it.  I just really don't understand why Spike chose to use sex to drive home the point about gun violence.  The artistry was murky to me.

7535723,5,B017W1P79I,"I thought it was an interesting take on ancient story. It was relevant and artistically well done. The style was classically Lee and reminded me a little of Do the Right Thing. I don't understand all the flak. The message I got, through a compelling if stylized story, was that it takes a community to change the way things are. It takes a local community and a world community. That there are a lot of factors involved. There is the poverty, the disinterest of the local government, the uselessness of the police, corporate prison system, the fear of the neighborhood, and the upbringing of young people that know no other life. People are safe in their suburbs until someone they know is killed.
One thing I thought was powerful that seemed to be overlooked by many is that it's the uplifting of women here, and across the globe, that is the only answer to the dilemma at hand. The reality is that if women stood up like that they risk abuse, violence, even death. Not because they are in Chi-raq but because they are women. The empowerment of women and girls, empower neighborhoods and empower people. Powerful women = peace. I am not sure this was intended by Lee but this is the truth that shines through with the simplistic No Peace - No Pussy.",1457568000,,1250,4.56

Most people were stuck on the whole ""no peace no p*ssy"" part. And because of that they miss the bigger message, the bigger story that's being told. My ONLY dislike was the Samuel JACKSON  narrative excerpts. Without him I think the flow of the movie would been better. But other than that. I more so appreciate this piece.

7535790,5,B017W1P79I,"This movie is art at its finest. Make no mistake--it deserves its R-rating, for both violence, language and sexual content. But brilliantly, Spike Lee uses the Ancient Green story of Lysistrata, who famously stopped a war by getting all the wives in the city to go on strike from their marriage beds, not only as the story, but also in the form of the performance. With an orator framing the action, and all the dialog (more or less) in rhyme, there is just enough emotional distance to make the brutality of the subject matter bearable, leaving me uplifted rather than traumatized. With plenty of singing, dancing, and eye candy, Lee uses the cultural modes and idiom of those he is speaking to and about to tell the human story behind the glorification of gang violence as well as the violence of racism and warfare--connections few are making in simplistic arguments either for or against gun control. He even gets in a few statistics, too, in entertaining ways, as well as the larger cultural context of the U.S. in perpetual wars, prison for profit, and the grinding poverty our economy enforces. This is the kind of movie than can, sometimes, create lasting change. Here's hoping.",1457481600,,1186,4.818627450980392

I am not sure the movie's solution would work but something has to be done. It is just way out of control. Our government should be spending money here doing something about this problem before aiding foreign countries and having unnecessary wars for big oil money. War is all about greed and corruption. We should forget about oil and focus on solar and wind power. So much technology available for all to live more green and peacefully. It is interesting that they never have money when our society needs it but when foreign countries beg for help it mysteriously becomes available...Government corruption needs to end and this country needs to become once again a government by the people for the people not a few corrupt officials in charge of our welfare that work in the interest of greedy corporations like Monsanto who are killing us at large with their GMOs and pesticides and control the USDA...our system is broken and needs to be fixed on lots of  levels...this movie shines a light on a very serious issue that seems to be largely ignored. Kudos to Spike Lee for addressing this issue although I doubt the movie's solution would work but hey anything is worth a try...this nonsense has to end somehow and the sooner the better.,1457481600,,1596,4.76173285198556

7535850,2,B017W1P79I,I enjoyed the movie - as with most of Spike's movies you cannot be to critical as we all have a different opinion on the Black experience in America. As since this country was built on the idea that we all are FREE - he is free to express his view of life. I wish the ideas expressed in this movie could be implemented so we could stop the killing of our people. Our babies deserve to live to become adults and the adults who are committing these crimes should be made to watch this movie. It should be required viewing. PEACE,1457395200,,526,4.166666666666667

Seeing this Spike Lee, one of my fav directors, version of the play, infused with the current day issues that face Chicago and the rest of the planet, brought another dimension to the Greek comedy. Though lacking the comedic element Aristophanes infused in the play, the movie illuminated the vital issue of eliminating the violence plaguing the human race. I can see why the establishment Academy ignored the movie, as the movie places much of the blame for our current crises on the wealthy white corporate oligarchy and its pursuit of money and power over respect for human life. Beyond the issues confronted by the movie, the attempt at comedy with the Snipes character and at the tragic hero with the Cannon character distracted from the overall thrust.",1457222400,,875,4.879194630872483

To use women as only good for sex is sad. Couldn't you have used a woman's intelligence instead? 3. To somehow tell the current inner-city Black narrative thru a Greek lens?

I expected more from Spike Lee. This comes off as a ""cash-in"" move using the term ""Chiraq"" as a way to make money. This had nothing to do with Chicago and more importantly it hurts the situation more then it helps.",1457222400,5,713,4.5703125

One would have expected that a movie dealing with a very important issue such as Black-on-Black violence, and poverty in the hood would be a family friendly production. The language is often very coarse, the scenes are raunchy; no sane person will watch the movie with young family members. So what is the value of the movie if it is such that it cant be watched by a general audience?

I thought Spike Lee would have produced a movie we can watch in our homes with our children, watch in community centers, churches and use it as a point of discussion on the issues of Black-on-Black murders and Gangbanging! Chi-Raq is another failed attempt at addressing the dying of innocent young ones (through reckless and avoidable violence) on the streets of Americas inner cities!

Nick Canon isn't really believable as a gangster, but the rest of the cast was amazing and everyone played their parts to a tee. Some may feel as this was exploiting the propblems and the negative aspect of Chicago without focusing on all the good in the city, but there is a balance of showing leadership and community togetherness of Chicago. Seeing the families of actual victims of violence in Chicago really it home as well for me. This may not solve their problems right now, but it is a place to start the conversation and bring forth a change in community response to violence and end the hood silence we face when things happen.",1532476800,,846,4.6466666666666665
