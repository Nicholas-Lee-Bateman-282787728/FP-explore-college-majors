3438722,4,B0019LQ1Z2,"The documentary gives a very good depiction of what an incredibly brave, monomaniacally driven man Messner was with respect to his climbing feats. It gives one reason to include Messner amongst the very greatest athletes of the last century -- if mountain climbing qualifies as a sport, which I see no reason why not.

It also provides some exquisite imagery of the Dolomites and South Tyrol, which provoked me to read up on Messner's native region.

Which leads me to offer a correction -- perhaps a trivial correction, but one I think it bears pointing out -- to something Messner says about the German-speaking population of South Tyrol.  He makes no mention that his fellow German-speakers were in fact massively persecuted by Mussolini and the Fascists after the population came under Italy's authority post WWII. He makes it sound as if they were absolute moral cretins for having voted to join Hitler's Germany. Certainly voting for ""heim ins Reich"" is quite bad -- and certainly in retrospect -- but given their immediate circumstances, there was actually something of a rational basis for their having done so. Messner here comes across as all too morally preening and self-effacing (something of a redundancy), a quality all too common to many contemporary Germans (""German,"" whether in an ethnic or civic sense).",1385164800,2,1323,5.059633027522936
3438723,5,B0019LQ1Z2,"Superb footage and composition. For those who have ears to hear will grasp Messner's essence in this film.
I only wish it was longer. Loved the footage...the scene of Messner and Habbeler coming down from completing the first Everest without oxygen...the look on Messner's face glowing like the sun....just great.",1385078400,,313,5.28
3438724,4,B0019LQ1Z2,"Highly recommended for an introduction to Messner and what makes him tick.  This my first exposure to him as a person, rather than just a name bandied about.  Very interesting and well recommended for anyone who enjoys the mountain wilderness .... (or who doesn't and wants to know why someone might).  Messner also humbly explains why he has been so successful  (right place, right time, right family, (shades of the book Outliers))  Enjoy!",1382572800,,441,4.986301369863014

3438726,4,B0019LQ1Z2,This is a well put together documentary that is just a little dated. It does a good job of letting Messner tell his own story.,1380844800,,126,4.08
3438727,3,B0019LQ1Z2,"Messner is without dispute one of the most talented and famous mountaineers of his generation but he's also a very complicated and, at times, controversial figure.

3438728,5,B0019LQ1Z2,"Beautiful views of Everest and the Dolomites and interesting commentary from Messner essentially about Messner.  This complex man was certainly the greatest climber of his time and may, in fact, end up being considered the greatest ever.",1374278400,,237,5.405405405405405
3438729,3,B0019LQ1Z2,"The title and description had me thinking this would be more adventurous, more personal. Messner narrates and describes his climbs, and particularly his remarkable ability to climb at high altitude without oxygen packs, something very few can do and survive.

The premise was wonderful, but it was just a little juiceless for me. Perhaps Messner was not that compelling a character outside of his favored activity. A remarkable climbing career though, and moutaineers will enjoy it no matter what.",1368403200,,497,5.291139240506329

3438733,2,B0019LQ1Z2,"I should've listened to the reviewer who said this DVD is short and really just an interview... or series of interviews.  I wanted to like this but didn't.  If you're looking for something about mountains, look elsewhere.  Like the other reviewer said, this would be a good DVD to add to your collection if you can find it used for $5, but no more than that.",1357084800,2,358,4.393939393939394
3438734,2,B0019LQ1Z2,"The name ""Messner"" sells.
The producers of this DVD are taking advantage of that.

The title of this DVD should be ""How to produce a DVD at minimum effort and minimum production cost which sells at a good price"".
The answer is obviously:
""Interview Reinhold Messner - a fascinating person with inspiring views about himself, the mountains and the impossible.""
PLUS: ""Make people think they are buying a comprehensive documentary on Messner's life and adventures on the mountains.""

I fell for that and I was VERY DISAPPOINTED.

This DVD shows Reinhold Messner in a recent interview filmed in his castle in northern Italy. The SHORT interview in English language is interlaced with a few images and some miminal footage documenting his life and his breathtaking adventures.
If you buy the DVD DO NOT EXPECT a documentary! In the Amazon review this DVD is compared to Werner Herzog's ""Dark Glow of the Mountains"". In my oppinion this comparison is gruesomly inappropriate. What an insult for Werner Herzog!!

This DVD is definitely NOT A REVIEW of Messner's expeditions and achievements. Do NOT EXPECT more than 5 minutes of significant footage of this kind. Do NOT EVEN EXPECT this DVD to even mention all of Messner's historic climbs or  expeditions.

This DVD was obviously produced to fill a 30min+ TV broadcast. At low production cost!
That it sure does.
Marketing the DVD as a great video compilation of Messner's life and adventures however is misleading.

Bottom line:
Messner gives an inspiring 30min+ interview which is worth seeing.
Messner is not only a fascinating man but also a remarkable philosopher.

Buy this DVD for $5. But asking $20 for this low cost production is definitely not okay. We shouldn't let the producers get away with that.",1230940800,33,1755,4.986301369863014
3438735,5,B0019LQ1Z2,"My only ""complaint"" in this DVD about Reinhold Messner is that it's too short! The DVD runs 47 minutes and no bonus extras. So too [** and you may wish to take a gander at my Amazon review of Messner's book, ""Reinhold Messner -- Free Spirit: A Climber's Life""], anyway, while this DVD came out in 2008, it was produced in 2002 and therefore 3 years 'prior' to the subsequent 2005 discovery on Nanga Parbat of the remains of Gunther Messner [verified via DNA] thereby totally vindicating Messner from those critics who alleged that Messner had ""abandoned his brother"" during the 1970 Nanga Parbat climb on the other side of the mountain face due to alleged ""ego driven ambition"" [sic]. That issue and J'accuse mongering therein by certain individuals or chronic Messner critics has now been put to bed.

In the DVD, Messner is quite candid and he also shows quite readily that contrary to some journalists opinion of him, he is not ""perpetually sucking on lemons"" [sic] nor ""gruff"" [sic] and can be rather jovial in demeanor. This too -- it is not Messner's fault when the mountaineering accolades come his way but then, as I stated in the review of ""Free Spirit"", Messner doesn't have to 'shut up' since he has amply ""put up"" during the bulk of his long career ranging from being the first 8,000'er [** the first man to climb the world's 14 highest mountains over 8,000 meters] and not to mention the additional accomplishments in 'both' the North and South Poles, the Gobi desert 2,000 kilometer trek, the Greenland ice-cap adventure, his 5 year stint as an MEP [** Member, European Parliament] representing the Italian South Tyrol since he is in fact an Italian by birth [** which comes as a complete surprise to some folks and to this day one can see hither and yon on the internet where Messner is mentioned as the world famous ""German"" [!] or ""Austrian"" [!] climber] albeit his German mother tongue derives from the German speaking South Tyrol section of Italy, his many successful books and public mountaineering lectures and the multiple mountaineering museums which he originated and administers therein.

Personally, I think Messner should get into producing his own and indeed 'expanded' DVD educational series because he possesses such a wealth and breath of experience that sharing such input and climbing/mountaineering experiences would, at least in my opinion, easily find both an avid and well interested audience. Myself among them.

""Passion for limits"" - Reinhold Messner's motto

Four and a half REVEALING Stars. ""Messner"" is a documentary about Reinhold Messner, one of the greatest climbers in history, famous for climbing everything from 8000 meter high peaks without oxygen including Everest, to his Dolomites routes, and far beyond. There is commentary from climbers like Chris Bonington, Ed Viesturs, Mario Dibona, and Kitty Calhoun who gives one of the great keys to his success. Messner gives his views on the Alpine assault technique, acclimatization, climbing without oxygen, anguish about the death of his brother Gunther on Nanga Parbat, his personal hero (not a climber), controversies, his personal philosophies and more. There are excerpts from ""The Dark Glow Of The Mountains"" by Werner Herzog, including one heartbreaking scene. There are clips of Messner and Peter Habeler becoming the first to summit Everest without oxygen and photos of Messner's later solo ascent without oxygen on Everest. Very few climbing scenes are shown, but much information from him and others about Messner the climber and the man, including life in his later years. If you have wondered about this man of such great accomplishments and heartbreak, here he is, in his own words. Narrated by actor Peter Strauss. Directed by award-winning film maker Les Guthman. This film needs to be closed captioned. Highly Recommended. Four and a half INFORMATIVE Stars. (Outside Television. Not Rated but a coarse reference & side nudity is shown. Color.
