1640827,4,B00005OCKA,"Along with the first few chapters of the Guitar For Dummies book, this dvd gives you a great hands-on chance to see the techniques of chord playing, and finger picking thats shown in the book.  It teaches you the basics as shown in the book, however it falls short it as it does not bother to mention any advanced lessons in the book, such as playing in position, fretboad logic, etc.
Still if you have the Guitar For Dummies book, get this as well.",1048809600,16,449,4.345238095238095
1640828,4,B00005OCKA,"This DVD is great for people who have little or no experience with playing guitar and want to begin without investing in private lessons (private lessons are a good idea if you can afford them). The DVD contains basics such as posture, hand position, a few basic chords, and strumming.  It even has a very basic introduction to fingerstyle (playing with your fingers instead of a pick).
I had taken a very basic class a few years ago, then taught myself barre chords and a few scales. I recently invested in a good mid-range guitar (Martin DC-16 GTE), so I picked up this dvd as a refresher.  I found myself skipping to chapter 8 before I came to anything I hadn't learned yet.  So the title ""Learning Guitar for Dummies"" is apt.  It is great for beginners as a SUPPLEMENT to private lessons.  For intermediate players who are looking to build such skills as fingerstyle, barre chords, scales and improvisation, etc, you'll need something a bit more advanced than this.  I found myself more bored and drooling over the Taylor 814 CE he was playing than focusing on the really basic concepts he was presenting.
Other drawbacks of the video:  1) his singing is terrible 2) he doesn't go over such basics as selecting and changing strings or some accessories that are helpful even for the novice (i.e. string winders, supplies for cleaning and maintaining the instrument- like a lint free cloth, a humidifier, etc).  3) in the video he does not always follow the suggested fingering shown in the chart on the screen (i.e. on a few of the songs he plays a G chord with the 1,2, and 4 fingers instead of the 1,2,3 as shown in the chart- I also prefer the 1,2,4 fingering, but this may be confusing to some beginners).  Other than that it is a good introductory video for the beginner.",1048032000,155,1779,4.586750788643533
1640829,4,B00005OCKA,"Great dvd to learn a couple of songs, but the only problem I have found so far is that in Jamaica Farewll the cording is wrong in the book with the guitarist on the dvd the first A chord should be a D chord and then the A after two strums and then back to D after two strums.",1046217600,2,275,3.6779661016949152
1640830,5,B00005OCKA,This DVD does an amazing job of understanding the pace of a beginner. The presenter has balanced very well the task of teaching the basics and at the same time teaching how to play simple songs. It gave me the visible rewards that were necesary to keep me continuosly motivated to learn more. I totally recommend this DVD to every beginner.,1034208000,18,340,4.590163934426229
1640831,4,B00005OCKA,I own this as well as The Hal Leonard Method DVD. I don't think you can bet the latter for beginners. I plan on coming back to this later to continue my guitar experience. Check them both out but do Hal Leonards first along with his method books. Enjoy!!!!!,1024617600,10,257,4.26530612244898
1640832,4,B00005OCKA,"Not having held a guitar in over 20 years, this DVD was a good place to start. There are lots of camera angles, and the instructor speaks clearly and explains well. The pop-up animation is entertaining but can also be distracting. I recommended this DVD for beginners, but wish the instructor would produce an follow up DVD. Possibly ""Guitar for not so dummies""?",1019865600,12,362,4.761904761904762
1640833,5,B00005OCKA,"Let me preface this review with this statement - I have been playing guitar for over 25 years. I wish this tape had been around then...
Last summer, I helped my sister pick out a guitar for my brother-in-law as a birthday gift. While visting them last month, Suzanne (my sister) told me of a tape Fred (my bro-in-law) had picked up to help boost his floundering attempt at kick starting his Rock Star career at the tender age of 46. It was very good, she said; the guy mixed humour with very easy to understand instruction for the novice and even tone deaf. Cool, thought I. Perhaps I should check it out sometime...
Well, as fate would have it, I woke up in advance of everyone else the next morning, and in leu of watching their broadcast selection of local television programming, I decicided to pop in ""Guitar Playing for Dummies"". Wow. Chapel's easy going manner without talking down to the guit-picking virgin is just what the doctor ordered. We walks you through the basic chords, simple strumming and picking patterns, all to some decent pop standards. You will come out of this believing...no...knowing that you can become at the very least, a pretty compitent player. If only this had been available back in 1976.
My 18 year-old just got the bug after his best friend started playing the bass. So I ordered him a copy...",1015632000,51,1330,4.616033755274262
1640834,5,B00005OCKA,"If you're thinking of taking up the guitar, and who hasn't, here's ""GUITAR FOR DUMMIES"" (Anchor Bay).  A great disc that remains true to its title with the super easy to follow instructions of friendly, skilled, instructor Jon Chappell.  You'll learn to form chords, fingerpick, strum and play songs in a variety of styles (rock, folk, blues, etc.) and, get this, all without having to bother with the nuisance of learning to read music.
No kiddng, you will be the center of attention and if not the life of the party at least be able to hold court in a corner of the room.

1640840,5,B00005OCKA,"This DVD was crucial to my advancement as a guitarist. I had taken classes before, and learned a song here and there, but I eventually gave up. Chapelle is a GREAT instructor. He starts off slow so you always feel like you are progressing. Some people say that they get bored by the instructor because they want to get to the SONGS. It is important however, not to rush things. I have noted many people who dive in head first and try to play the hard stuff at the beginning. they just end up discouraging themselves and quiting. The pace of this DVD is perfect for keeping you encouraged to go on. Chappelle's demeanor also makes me want to invite the guy to dinner :D he comes off like a very likable guy. Get this DVD if you are an absolute beginner to guitar and you will have a good base to move on to more advanced material.",1267574400,,829,4.253164556962025

1640843,4,B00005OCKA,I have not finished using this product but so far so good.  I am a beginner and the pace of the video is good for me.  I would recommend this product for beginners who want to move at a slow speed.,1235260800,,197,3.7804878048780486

1640845,1,B00005OCKA,"This DVD is a waste of money. It does contain some useful information for a beginner but the cold hard truth is the amount of information provided is not worth anything more than the plastic its made of. So unless you pick this up from a friend for free, I highly advise you not  waste your time and money ordering this product. This DVD says it will teach you how to read music. Lmao scrolling music notes across the bottom as the instructor plays is not ""teaching"".

***If you're a beginner and want to learn the guitar you can find all kinds of great information on youtube for free. My favorite instructor is Paul Gilbert.",1232496000,2,626,4.434782608695652

1640850,5,B00005OCKA,"At the same time I bought my grandson a guitar from Amazon for his birthday, I decided to buy this video so he could learn the basics.

Not saying my grandson Johnny is a dummy--far from it!--all the title means to me is that it contains simple instructions to help beginners learn to play the quitar quicker.

With its easy-to-follow format, watching the instructor and following along, Johnny began picking and strumming in no time, and now he's a regular little Kenny Chessney. :)

A good investment.

1640851,1,B00005OCKA,"I was very disappointed in this CD program. I have used some of the ""Dummies"" books in the past with great success, and I thought this would measure up the same way.

How wrong I was. I need the most basic of basics to play my guitar. I am mechanically proficient in many areas, but not with a 6-string. The video is too fast paced for me. Some may find it useful, but, for me, it was a bomb.",1194739200,2,392,3.962025316455696
1640852,4,B00005OCKA,My husband loved this book. Now all he needs to do it find a manager and off he'll go into the world of music. Really though...it is a great start. He learned so much from it. and it was easy to follow for him. Thank you,1167868800,3,220,3.8043478260869565
1640853,5,B00005OCKA,An excellent begginer instructional DVD.  I had purchased a different instructional guitar DVD prior to this and this one far surpasses it. Starts off slow and builds on what you've learned.  Excellent product.,1154563200,15,210,5.333333333333333
1640854,5,B00005OCKA,"I really loved it it is very easy to follow. But of course you would not like the songs.

Really excellent even for kids (Specially dummies) ...LOL",1152748800,11,219,4.425
1640856,4,B00005OCKA,"At my request, my wife bought me a guitar about a year ago.  It sat, collecting dust, until I finally had a little time to spend with it.  What I needed was a very basic DVD that would show a beginner (like me) the ins and outs of playing a guitar.  I think that is exactly what this DVD does.  It is probably the equivalent to 4 or 5 lessons for beginners. You learn a little bit about the different types of guitars, the parts of a guitar, some chords a little about strumming and you even practice a couple songs. The DVD seems like you are being instructed by your high school band teacher so it doesn't have the cool factor of watching an aging rocker with over processed hair.  That is just fine with me.  It is clear that a lot of thought went into the selections of the songs and lessons so as to cover a lot of the beginner's basics.  Yes, Mr. C can't sing, but who cares, the DVD isn't singing for dummies.  I think that the DVD is great for someone like me who wants to get a little familiar with a guitar, but doesn't have the time to go out to weekly lesion.  The DVD is a first step, it is not intended for someone who is already an accomplished player.",1143936000,30,1167,4.083333333333333
1640857,1,B00005OCKA,"I bought this book for my son who has never had a lesson but has been self teaching himself for a few years. The things I was disappointed about 1) the singing is so HORRIBLE it is almost impossible to watch.  My son became frustrated with this alone and never wanted to continue...His exact words, ""This is LAME.""  He wouldn't use it, so I decided to try to learn guitar to keep from wasting my money.  2) The descriptions on the cover are misleading and lead you to believe there is much more advanced instruction than is actually in it...there is little about much of it and then it is not what the instructor leads you to believe it is...for example the jazz chords are not actually what you expect to learn.  3) The instructor uses different fingering techniques than he instructs you to use, so learning it is very hard...part of the advantage of buying a dvd is WATCHING the instructor...which is totally useless if he is doing something different than he instructs you to do.  Also it is hard to keep up with him as his fingering techniques allow him to change chords much more quickly and you are struggling to keep up.  Being frustrated when you are trying to learn is NOT a good way to stay motivated.  My son had to tell me it wasn't me it was the instructor. 4) my son knew ALL of the material in this DVD although he has never had a lesson.  I would recommend this for a very early beginner who had no clue about chords or guitars at all.  Otherwise, SAVE YOUR MONEY.  I did learn a little. I am a complete idiot about guitars but knew a good bit of what was presented just from guitars being in my home.  This is the most elementary information you can imagine.",1133049600,31,1676,4.339743589743589
1640858,4,B00005OCKA,"I decided to ""try"" guitar, and of course found the ""guitar for dummies"" DVD.  The narrator covers the basics, and has you playing a sond within minutes.  ""Fara jaqua"" isn't the coolest song, but it's something.  The chords are displayed on the screen, and he goes slow enough to follow.  This really is a good beginners guide to guitar.....Good luck and enjoy!",1129507200,13,360,4.758064516129032
1640859,4,B00005OCKA,"this product is very recomendable for people who don't have enough time or money for private lessons. very easy to understand and to follow. could be a little longer.

only the singing is annoying",1125100800,10,196,4.764705882352941
1640860,3,B00005OCKA,"What annoyed me the most is when Jon switches to the G chord and uses a different fingering method than the one he says the student should us. When I first watched the video, I thought ""Which chord is he ^$@%^$@ playing?! It's supposed to be G but its not G according to the fingers hes using!"" and then I realized what it was.....

This was my first video I watched and really followed along properly since the last time I picked up my guitar was approximately 2 - 3 years ago. When I first started off, I felt horrible since I could barely keep up with the basic C chord and the first few songs... I wasn't used to the idea of having to stop the video, practice for maybe even a few days, and then continue the video. However, when I mastered every song in the video, it felt good and I felt confident that I could go to sometihng else. However, I don't feel ready for anything intermediate as I feeel like all I can do is strum chords and a bit of finger picking... no powerchords were taught, how do I practice to get best results? Nothing from this video.

The bottom line is, if you're new to guitar, this is a worthy video to build that confidence if you can play through it. If you can strum chords, or have been playing for say a year or so, forget this video.",1116201600,24,1269,4.154471544715447
1640861,3,B00005OCKA,"After watching a borrowed copy of this video, I decided to buy it. Overall, I think this is a good video for beginning guitarists. I like John Chappell's teaching method. However, upon careful scrutiny I noticed that when he plays some of the songs (such as ""Michael Row the Boat Ashore"" and ""Sloop John B."") he uses different fingerings for some chords (like G and Dm) than the fingerings he told the viewer to use. The alternate fingerings (using the pinkie finger, which is difficult for beginners) allow the instructor to make quick chord changes during the song. But a viewer using the recommended fingerings will be struggling to keep up and may become frustrated.

In addition to this video, I recommend the eMedia Guitar Method software.  It is a very complete teaching system, well paced for the novice guitarist.",1114992000,16,822,4.864285714285714

My 12 year old Daughter decided to learn to play the guitar so I got my old guitars out and started playing again. I ordered this DVD Learning Guitar for Dummies, by Jon Chappell and found it to be an excellent first lesson for the beginner guitar player. Not only did I learn some thing's I did not know but my daughter sat through the whole DVD with her guitar. Jon has a great way of explaining things slowly and easily. I would recommend this DVD for any beginner guitar player. Even if you know nothing about the guitar, you will by the end of this DVD. I had also ordered another Guitar learning DVD and found it to be not nearly as good as this one. Two Thumbs up to this DVD! The only thing I was disappointed about was I could not find any other DVD's put out by Jon Chappell.",1092009600,51,945,4.086021505376344
1640864,5,B00005OCKA,"This was the first DVD I ever bought on the subject.  I ordered I even before I bought my first guitar, so I was a real beginner.
The pace is very slow, but as a beginner, I liked it that way.  It helped me to feel like I had the potential to keep up.  This was very important to me so that I wouldn't give up.
Some may feel the pace of this DVD is too slow, but if you are interested in starting slowly... this may be just the right pace for you.
Eventually, I started collecting Guitar DVDs and I now have over 20, but this was the one that held my interest long enough to make it past the training wheel stages.",1071532800,130,614,3.896
1640865,1,B00005OCKA,"I am glad to see that some people have found this DVD useful.  If you barely know what a guitar is, this is an inexpensive introduction to guitar playing.  However I truly feel like a dummy (more like a sucker) for having purchased and watched this DVD.  This is a shallow treatment, which would be OK if the cover were not so misleading.
The back cover includes the phrase ""Play in a variety of syles, including folk, blues, rock, and jazz.""  (Yes play these styles, but this DVD won't help you.)  And it includes the phrase ""Play open-position chords and jazz chords.""  This is the one that suckered me.  Most musicians consider a ""jazz chord"" to be something more complex than a seventh chord - a ninth, eleventh, or thirteenth, perhaps with a flatted or augmented member.  This presentation includes three or four major triads, three or four minor triads, and one or two seventh chords.  This goes at least one step beyond the usual truth-stretching ubiquitous in advertising.
Jon Chappell does an adequate job of demonstrating a handful of basic chords and changing between them.  He uses the same ""Row, row, row your boat"" kind of songs found in hundreds of other introductory music books.  This is understandable, and the new musician should take pride and pleasure in playing simple things.  But there is nothing fresh or thoughtful about the approach of this presentation.  It is a rehash of the simplest things common in so many of these run-of-the-mill introductions.
If you have never picked up a guitar before, go ahead and get this DVD.  It's cheap enough.  Listen to Jon and take what he says to heart.  I would like to think there is something better for the beginner, but this will work.  If you already know a couple of chords, and can strum along with any song already, there is little for you here.",1065225600,55,1818,4.684542586750789
