1866893,5,B00008YGRX,"We were very disappointed when the show was cancelled.  Now, with the DVD's we are reminded how much we miss it.  This was a great show with a great premise.  We were hoping the DVD's would give us some clue as to why it was cancelled.  Nevertheless, we are really enjoying watching them and are looking forward to buying season 2.",1056412800,,331,4.377049180327869
1866894,5,B00008YGRX,"The second season of Dark Angel was awesome, so naturally I was extremely ticked when I heard it wasn't coming back for a third season.  When I heard that DVD's of the first and second season were coming out, I naturally had to get them.  Dark Angel was an awesome show, and with the DVD's I can see it again, plus it'll have all the cool special features and stuff like that.  It's a must for all Dark Angel adicts like me.  I'll just sit at home drowning in boredom this summer until they release the DVD's.  That or I'll just go out and buy the third book coming out by Max Allan Collins.  It's called Dark Angel: After the Dark.",1053475200,10,632,4.181818181818182
1866895,3,B00008YGRX,"When Dark Angel moved to Friday nights at 8pm on Fox, we knew the show was doomed.  DA fans secretly wished Firefly (its replacement) would die a horrible death.  The fact is...the second season got away from the core of the first - it was too surreal, though beautifully directed and acted.
I'm a huge fan...a bit disappointed with how the series ended.  I agree, Fox shouldn't have cancelled the show - but then again the writers should have given us a better 2nd season.",1052179200,7,473,4.541176470588235

1866922,5,B00008YGRX,"Too bad this series never really took off. Why do good shows always get canceled? I did hear the writers probably copied a lot of the story from a show called cybersix.

I bought them to watch over again when I get some free time this fall (or before if I get tired of the garden).  I wouldn't put it past the government to be doing some of the thing shown in the series.  Although some were a little far fetch but added a lot of interest and possibilities.

Max is forced, along with many other Manticore refugees, to live on the streets in secrecy, using their powers only on rare occasions. However, the day is soon coming when they must all fight together if they want to stay in Seattle. I would describe this as Blade Runner meets the Bionic Woman.

1867003,5,B00008YGRX,What an amazing post apocalyptic show! I love the sci-fi nature of the genetic manipulation mixed with the action of a world devastated by electrical and financial ruin. The drama of the show was great and the back story of why they did experiments was intriguing. I was sad when this show ended and thought they could have developed the series further.,1412812800,,353,4.709677419354839

1867007,2,B00008YGRX,"Putting the same review here for both seasons, for continuity.

Fabulous show that not many people seem to have watched.  Jessica Alba & Jensen Ackles, primarily (he didn't show up until very late), but with cameos by a lot of people you might know today.  Dystopian future in which kids are bred and genetically manipulated to be superhuman soldiers.  I remember being really wowed by Jessica Alba - hadn't seen her before.  She's really something - smart, snarky, quick, temperamental, and of course naturally gorgeous (but not always with the same look).  Ackles (now better known for his guest role as Jason Teague on Smallville and for his main role as Dean Winchester in Supernatural) is wonderfully snarky eye candy and a great foil for Alba's character.

Well, the first season was fabulous.  Second season took a weird turn and got not just strange but unbelievable - more bizarre looking characters; a vicious new conspiracy - but you'll want to watch it anyway, so you can see what comes of the main characters and so you'll get to do lots of complaining about what the writers/directors/producers did to the show between seasons.  I think it would have gone for several more seasons if they hadn't derailed it.",1409443200,,1222,4.8647342995169085
1867008,5,B00008YGRX,Loved it. Now I need Season 1 so I know what happened in 1st season.,1408924800,,68,3.6
1867009,5,B00008YGRX,"If you're ever looking for your next kick ass heroine, you've found here.  Jessica Alba stars as a total badass girl striving to escape her past.  I love it.",1408233600,,157,4.379310344827586
1867010,4,B00008YGRX,A good series which was way to short. A dark time but for a few who survive the training and escaped. The series do illustrate what might be our future.,1406937600,,152,4.1

1867019,3,B00008YGRX,Season 1 was better,1405987200,,19,4.0
1867020,4,B00008YGRX,"Dark Angel Season 2 was very different from season 2 and not everyone liked the change. All in all, it was still a fun show with its own emotional punch and twists and turns. (No spoilers, just a general description below)

Season 2 is notably more campy than Season 1 with an ""X-Men"" like theme driving the plot this time around. On the plus side, the new addition of characters were (mostly) strong. Alec was a great character that added some humor to the series (and easy on the eyes). Joshua started out a bit too on the camp side, but as the series progressed they fleshed out his character's emotional depth for the better. White, unfortunately, was a weaker character. Whereas Lydecker was nuanced and 3-dimensional, White was far more one-note as the constantly sneering, ruthless villain. Dark Angel is at its best when its characters are complex. I didn't much care for the villain this season.

As for the plot arc itself, it had its ups and downs. There were far more ""filler"" episodes this season and some were a bit hit or miss. The effects budget seemed notably slashed this season, too. The science fiction trended a bit more toward supernatural and fantasy than I would have liked at times. Although this season was not as great as the first, you still had some surprises, tearjerkers, and laughs along the way. The end of the season finished strong with themes of bigotry, prejudice, and isolation. It was interesting to watch Max's journey and a shame that it never had a real conclusion.",1404172800,,1507,4.683018867924528
1867021,5,B00008YGRX,loved the fact that this vendor had the identical packaging as my season 1 set I bought at initial retail time. They have since smooshed it into a 2disk set or something I believe.,1396483200,,180,4.323529411764706

1867023,5,B00008YGRX,This was Jessica Albas new role as an actress. She did great and the stories held my interest. I remember getting all my vhs tapes ready to record the episodes of Dark Angel 1st and 2nd seasons. I trashed all those bulky tapes now that I have both seasons on dvd.,1393545600,,263,4.176470588235294
1867024,5,B00008YGRX,"I had the first season already, now my purchase of the 2nd season completes it. This was a great show when it lasted, if only it had been on TV longer than a couple of seasons. Anyway, great memories for me. I highly recommend this season.",1392768000,,239,4.217391304347826

1867026,4,B00008YGRX,"(spoilers). Fascinating post-Apocalypse view of Seattle (where nothing much has changed for the 1%) as a police state. Cat-gene included cat-burglar continues to evolve and strike back against corruption generally and aid mutants created by mysterious government forces. But FOX left viewers dangling after indicating Season 3 would be taken up. Unfinished threads include getting leads free from virus keeping them apart, fate of mutants, what falling meteors(?) mean, will another police lieutenant be turned to the side of justice after government agent/freak tramples on him; what is the  evilsnake cult building up to  ( even to save  humanity); will any of the absent characters return, what happened to the ""Father"" of the genetically-altered people who could have been good or evil. Hint why no Season 3: increasing on-show criticism of some beings called ""Republicans""  by name as being responsible for Apocalypse not smart for producers trying to stay on FOX.",1390953600,,969,5.397350993377484

1867044,4,B00008YGRX,This is a good show. The first season was a little slow but as it went on it got a lot more interesting. It is about a genetically made girl who is always on the run from the ones who made here and others like her.,1382918400,,214,3.6739130434782608

1867070,3,B00008YGRX,"I truly enjoyed the first season of this show - it was atmospheric, dark & the storylines simultaneously kept me on the edge of my seat and amused at the goings on.  I was instantly transported into the post-Pulse society and totally bought into Max's efforts to locate her fellow ""X-5's"" transgenics; her relationships with her co-workers and budding romance with Logan.  I also really enjoyed the season long story arc of Max searching for her brothers & sisters while helping Logan expose and/or take down criminals.

However Season 2 focuses more on the mutated transgenics and the hardships they face after escaping from Manticore while being tracked down by a rogue government agency that seeks to capture and/or kill them all.

This season lost a lot of cast chemistry and charm (for me at least) by focusing less on Max's relationships with her co-workers and Logan and more on her efforts to ""save"" a transgenic each week while establishing her relationships with the new characters, Joshua (the first transgenic who has the face & traits of a dog) & Alec (a clone of one of Max's X5 brothers).

I wished that they could've integrated the new characters into the storyline a little smoother instead of limiting the roles of or dropping prominent characters of last season: Original Cindy, Sketchy, Lydecker, Bling (Logan's assistant), Sabastian (the quadriplegic) and Herbal Thought.

Logan and Max's chemistry was as irresistible as always. The virus however was horrible to them and the show. This wasn't a continuation of Dark Angel season one. This was an attempt at turning the series into something completely different.

1867112,4,B00008YGRX,"I wish there were half star ratings on Amazon.  I would have given the second season of Dark Angel a 3 1/2 star rating.  Better than average (3 stars) but not a great season.  But that is neither here nor there.

Dark Angel Season 1 is amazing but Season 2 became the series finale for two reasons.  First was a reason beyond their control.  Fox moved a successful mid-week show that attracted male viewers (teenage to 39) in high numbers to Fridays night; which is a death blow especially for a show that relies on younger veiwers.  The second reason this season failed is that the writing and plot lines got weaker.

SPOILERS BELOW:
Season 2 starts with Max trapped back in Manticore as they begin to try to reprogram her to be their little super-soldier.  She doesn't plan to stay there long.  During her efforts to escape, she ends up in the basement where she meets Joshua, the first transgenetic experiement who has an animal face and human body (they say he is suppose to look like a dog but he looks more like a lion to me).  All the transgenetic mistakes (or ones that don't look human are locked in the basement).  Without giving up too much, Max escapes but she also releases all of the transgentics in Manticore out into the world.

In Season 1 had a few on-going story lines - Max wanted to find her brothers and sisters (the 11 other transgenetics that escaped with her the first time), avoiding Liedecker (who turned out to be a layered bad guy), and helping Eyes Only (Logan).

None of these themes carry through on Season 2.  Max now considers anyone who was made at Manticore her brother or sister so the original group is forgotten about.  Liedecker was ousted from the agency and the end of Season 1.  He continues to work to discover what is going on and why.  But as this story is developing he is run off the road.  A body is never found but Liedecker never reappears.  And Eyes Only seems to be working for Max rather than her doing missions for him.

I could live with these changes.  While I was still curious about her orginal brothers and sisters they weren't vital to the show.  Liedecker was replaced by Ames White.  He hired by the government to round up all transgenics.  We also learn that he is a member of a secret group that has been breeding for perfection for generations.  Through this breeding they can do everything the transgenics do (super-villians for our super-heroes).

They big problems with Season 2 is the writing and some plot lines.  The cool idea was that these transgenics walk among us.  Now over half the individual story lines focused on transgenics who looked nothing like us.  While it only made sense that some existed, they were only in the basement at Manticore while the remaining 3 levels were packed with human looking transgenics.  So why is every story based on such a few number?  The stories also sometimes were absurd and the writers kept trying to infuse some humor that just came off as silly.  The writers also fell into the Star Trek trap - they kept introducing new people gave them a larger role than normally expected to kill them off (in Star Trek going down a planet would be Kirk, Spock, Bones, and ensign""fill in the blank""; who did you think would die).  Finally, at what turned out to be the Series finale, the transgenics are claiming a place of their own, but almost every transgenic in the place is again a mutant looking thing.

Overall the show was good and I would loved to see where the 3rd season story line took us...but it wasn't great like season 1.",1301184000,,3542,4.5070643642072215
1867113,5,B00008YGRX,"I just want to give people a heads up. This version is NOT widescreen.
If you have a widescreen TV, you should head over to Amazon.uk and order
the PAL (European) version. It's encoded in anamorphic 16:9 widescreen
format. The only downside is, you will need to play it back on a PAL-compatible DVD player or
hook your computer up to your TV, as all computers can play back PAL or NTSC.
It's a shame FOX gave us NTSC (American) viewers this cropped 4:3 version.
The version from Amazon.uk cost the same as this even with shipping, and took two
weeks to get here.
Hope this helps someone.
I'm still giving this 5 stars, because it's a wonderful show in any format.

1867128,4,B00008YGRX,"Season 2 of the Fox sci-fi drama Dark Angel is alot different than the first. Without giving the season one finale away, our transgenic heroine Max (Jessica Alba) ends up back at Manticore, but doesn't stay put for long. She escapes after taking the prison (that's basically what it was) down and releases all of the imprisoned transgenics. About that, not all of the ""gennies"" are quite human. Max has a bit of cat DNA herself (the episodes where she goes into heat are hilarious), but she still has a human appearance. The older ones, not so much. See, they were given too much animal DNA in their genetic cocktails so they possess more freakish appearances.

Like Joshua (Kevin Durand), Max's friend and adoptive brother. He was the first transgenic Manticore ever created and has a human body with a dog face. Still a sweetheart though. Anyway, all the gennies are freed and manage to escape into society. The ""regular"" folks freak out and new villian Ames White (Martin Cummins) is called upon by the government to cover up the Manticore crimes by exterminating them. Needless to say, Max is on the top of his list. She feels it's her job to protect her transgenic siblings while laying low as best she can herself.

Her relationship with Logan (Michael Weatherly) becomes complicated too. While back at Manticore, the bad guys figured out Max was in cahoots with Eyes Only (they still don't know he's Logan) and infect her with a virus that will kill him on skin to skin contact. The two try their best to keep their romance going, but Logan's new assistant Asha (Ashley Scott) tends to get in the way as well. Another new character is fellow X-5er Alec (Jensen Ackles). Max meets him back at Manticore and the two form a love/hate sibling-like relationship. Alec (as in smart aleck) is a nice guy overall, but always looking out for himself and constantly on the look out for some get rich scheme. Sweet, but not too smart since he manages to get himself in trouble alot.

Original Cindy (Valarie Rae Miller), Sketchy (Richard Gunn), and Normal (J. C. MacKenzie ) also return, but there's no mention of Kendra (Jennifer Blanc) or Herbal Thought (Alimi Ballard). Where'd the hell they go? Beats me. Anyway, Joshua (who's guaranteed to warm your heart) and Alec are welcome additions to the cast. While the second season does border on a gimmicky ""transgenic of the week"" feel, it also has a powerful message of ""people fear and hate what they don't understand"" that's relatable to everybody. Season 2 is also darker and more somber than the first. Not to say season 1 was always happy, but most of the episodes held on to some form of hope. The second season finale is awesome, although there are a couple of storylines that don't get completely wrapped up. Enjoy!

Watching it the second and even third time were equally as good.  Jensen Ackles was a great addition to the show, and didn't take away from Jessica Alba or Michael Weatherly's characters.

You will get your money's worth and I am sure you will love it as much as I do.  If you think its just a girl show you are very wrong because every male I have talked about it with says they loved it too. Several have bought the sets like I have.  I am now purchasing the books because unfortunately the show only lasted two seasons on the air.  The network was crazy for not continuing it.  If you have watched Supernatural which is on now you will notice that Jensen Ackles character's personality is very much the same as it was in season two of Dark Angel.  Alec (Jensen's character named because he is such a smart alec) brings more humor to the show and paired up with Jessica (who is usually taking things very seriously) they make a great team.,1207526400,,984,4.202127659574468

1867156,3,B00008YGRX,"The second season started with promise but its shift in direction was ultimately disappointing. The writing had a different focus and spirit. The first season had its political undertone, with Eyes Only's subversive broadcasts, an oppressive Military Protectorate (via the sector police) and the U.S. as a ""broke ex superpower"" mired in depression. This political undertone largely disappears in the second season as the level of violence is ramped up, and this plus various gags change the character of the show. The Holloween episode was so inane I couldn't watch it again. The focus of Eyes Only became more trivial. Nonetheless, some of the episodes were very well done, such as the Berrisford Agenda with Jensen Ackles, and the finale, Freak Nation.

A bizarre snake cult replaces the secret government Manticore project as the main villain....moving the show further away from reality. As one reviewer points out, the commentaries are a worthwhile addition on this DVD. Apparently the shift in the show was motivated in part by the more conservative political climate after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Nonetheless, I do recommend this DVD, especially if you got hooked on season one. It's unfortunate the show was cancelled after season two, as there were plenty of loose ends and potential directions they could have gone in. I did read the two follow-up novels, but unfortunately they suffer from some of the defects of season two compared to season one and do not resolve all the loose ends adequately.",1197676800,2,1512,5.117408906882591

1867170,4,B00008YGRX,"Although I enjoyed season two, it didn't work for me as well as season one.  And I've come to realized is that I prefer my science fiction to be more reality based and plausible.  The ""freak of the week"" and Agent White and his breeding cult didn't work for me.  Agent White was sinister enough working for the government.  Alec was a great addition to the cast as Max's annoying ""older brother"".  Joshua was also a good addition and had many fine moments.  What really bugged me about this season is the way some supporting characters would appear and disappear without explaination, especially Lydecker.  Some of the guest stars were very good and I would have liked to see them come back in future episodes, if there were any. The idea to keep Max and Logan apart because Max's touch would kill Logan was very clever.  I always believed the attraction between the two was more of an infatuation instead of love and the notion of them becoming intimately involved would eventually ruin the relationship instead of strengthen it (life imitates art).  It was good to see that at the end they were beginning to let each other go yet they still did have a deep admiration and respect for each other.  And isn't that what's really important in a relationship?

I don't know what Fox was thinking about when they cancelled Dark Angel, but they really blew it.  Apparantly the show was picked up for a third season, then immediately dropped.  The show should have gone on for at least one more season.  If for anything to finish up all the loose story lines left dangling at the end of the season.",1184630400,,1592,4.579505300353357

1867172,2,B00008YGRX,"After the success of Season 1, the brain trust at Fox decided to tool around and change some aspects of their popular series.
Season 2 is like watching a totally different series, one that isn't very good. I hoped that at the end, Max would've wakened from her coma at the end of Season 1 and the whole of Season 2 would've been a nightmare. Sadly this wasn't the case. Season 2 killed the show. It flew off the rails.
Missing is the whole relationship aspect of the show between characters which is what made it work so well in the first place. Nana Visitor, who was a great and under-utilized villian, is killed off in the season opener. Original Cindy gets less airtime and her friendship with Max becomes a non issue. Lydecker, who I wanted to see more of, is written off and replaced with the ridiculous Aimes White and his even dumber 'breeding cult'. (What were the writers thinking?) And strangely everyone has cooler hairstyles. I guess there is still a Supercuts in the distant future.
Dark Angel, which was so firmly planted in sci-fi probabilty, did a 180 in Season 2 to sci-fi unreality. It became a creature of the week feature with mole people, lizard people and even vampire like mutants. At times it was painful to watch.
Still, through it all, Jessica Alba and Michael Weatherly did the best they could with the material they had to work with and there are moments in the midst of madness that you catch glimpses of what made the show so great. 'Hello, Goodbye' is probably the best episode of Season 2 if you can overlook the spewing Aardvark like creature. 'Brain' is sweet, funny and touching. And the addition of Jensen Ackles to the cast to play off of Alba was great.
Both Alba and Weatherly have stated that Season 1 is really what the show was about. It's too bad the studio execs didn't listen to their stars.",1182988800,6,1836,4.516516516516517

Alec is a happy go lucky ladies man with sarcasm and a smile for everything- glibly making his way in the post-Mantacore world- that is until about mid-season when we start to see that the smiles and jokes mask a pain and darkness that lives inside. Sound like another Jensen character?

His comic timing and delivery of some of the best comebacks are great as sidekick material. He is a foil and supporter of Max and her reluctance acceptance of him as a friend and part of her family is important as the war against the mutants unfolds.

The Max-Logan-Virus issue got really old and wish it would have been resolved. But I really liked the last few episodes.

It was still good, tho and if you're a fan, I'd definitely recommend it.  Because any bit of Max & Logan is still good.  If it's the first time, try season one first.  Season One is da bomb.

There are 3 commentary tracks, which are helpful if you want to know plans for season 3 and beyond (this was one of main reasons I wanted this set).  But it's more writers/producers and not any of the actors except for sketchy commentating.  Blooper reel was just ok.

I guess I just identified better with an escaped soldier fugitive trying to hack out a normal existence in a post-apocalyptic police state, with friends like a computer genius conspiracy theorist and a few beer-drinking bike messengers.  But then, I'm pretty dark.  In season 2 the antagonist is uncomplicated and unambiguous, her relationships are shallower and... well, more campy.  Plus I really hate the narration during the opening credits-the infomercial dramatic woman has to come out every fireturcking episode and tell me ""they made her to be the perfect soldier..."" as if we're all too stupid to figure this out.  I understood what was going on during twenty-something episodes of season 1 without the narrator, right??  Just play the song, dammit.  Who's jackass idea was that anyway?  On that topic, it wasn't until episode 20 of the second season that they play the whole song from the intro, and it's really good.  Just a side note here, the music at the end of each episode is cool.  Basically two chords, a minor tonic that moves to a major sub-dominate- dorian mode mixture!  Then it juxtaposes layers of urban and world styles... and this eastern-style female vocalist comes in on the m7 of the tonic and holds the note as the chord changes to the borrowed IV-making it a sus4.  Absolutely exquisite.  It gives me chills even after 40 episodes.  Sorry, I'm a musicologist.  Anyway, the music really captures the what the show, in its intended essence, is: dark but optimistic, violent but peace-advocating, complicated... but predictable.

Joshua shouldn't have been on that many episodes, he gets annoying! Lydecker vanished after episode 3 and there were too many unrealistic creatures.

I will point out the best episodes of this final season:

Episode 1: ""designate this"" 10/10 This helps you figure out the new charecters and how she escapes manticore, again.

episode 2: ""Bag 'em"" 10/10 Manticore is killing the soldiers because they need to destroy evidence, Max must stop them and she runs in to Alec again.

Episode 7: 10/10 ""some assembly required"" Zack comes back, after killing himself last season to give Max his heart..I liked seeing him come back again.

Episode 11: 10/10 ""The Berrisford Agenda"" emotional episode of Alec's past and his first love, good watch.

Episode 15 10/10 ""FUHGEDDABOUDIT"" This is THE MOST unforgettable episode to me because it is so funny! A sweet and unexpecting newbie at Jam Pony is erasing Logan and Max's memory to help her lover, HILARIOUS!

Episode 20: 10/10 ""Love anong the ruins"" and Episode 21: 11/10 ""Freak Nation"" both conclude the mystery about Max, who made her and all about some of this seasons main charecters...satisfying end to the series.

THE DUMB EPISODES WERE: Episode 5: 3/10 ""BOO"" You mean it was just a dream? and Episode 4 ""Radar love"" huh? 6/10 they are only filler episodes and are not that interesting..

This is a must see TV series that should NOT have been cancelled, but you know how FOX is!

The mystery is solved, an unexpected ending and an interesting show that had such a good idea and could have gone on so much longer.. dang you fox!",1127520000,5,1736,4.71523178807947
1867220,5,B00008YGRX,"Love this show so I love the DVD, the extras are ok...I wish there had been better outtakes than what they showed and some longer interviews with the cast would have been great also.",1127433600,2,182,4.382352941176471
1867221,4,B00008YGRX,"In the first season of Dark Angel it only took about three or four episodes for the writers to really settle into the characters and story.  Season one ended with a nice cliffhanger as to what would become of Max.

In the second season it takes the writers way too long to get to the real heart of the storyline.  Most of the early episodes almost border on the ridiculous.  You could start from episode 9 and not miss much before that, as the conspiracies and origins of Manticore begin to intrigue the audience.  The kick-off episode was good, but the ones that follow, aside from the story of Zack, simply don't do justice to the series.  Even Jessica Alba and Michael Weatherly claim that Season 2 was NOT Dark Angel.  You'll find this during their commentary of the final episode in Season 1.

One problem is that John Savage (Lydecker) is only present for another 3 episodes before he's gone.  John Savage is a hard actor to replace, although you really do have to give credit to the addition of Martin Cummins as Agent Ames White.  He really does play the evil agent very well.  Listen to Cummins's voice in the interviews and you'll hardly believe it's the same guy!

Kevin Durand is also added as the first transgenic by the man who created them: Sandeman.  Durand plays the character of Joshua who has a bit much of canine DNA.  After a few episodes, he becomes a very likeable character and a good addition to the show as Joshua has almost child-like qualities as he tries to hide from a world that hates him.  Again, though, it takes a while for the writers to really make him a compelling character.  At first, you think this character is ridiculous.

My favorite addition to the show was Alec (Jensen Ackles).  Alec lightens the mood in a dark show, and he does so in a fun way as Max's transgenic ally who is best at looking out for himself.  He brings some hilarious moments to the show, and Jensen plays him perfectly.  His lighter character becomes almost a need as Max's character becomes almost unlikeable in certain stages.  She's always brooding and snapping at everyone around her.

Season 2 focuses much on the origins of Manticore.  Who started it?  Where did Sandeman come from?  Just how far does this conspiracy go?  It also focuses on Max and her role.  Is she simply another transgenic or does she have an even greater purpose?

As I stated before, Max is more brooding and angry in this season than in the last.  Sometimes, you miss the softness under the wise-cracking, tough exterior.  Overall, her character was more appealing in Season One.  But then, of course, she is frustrated by not being able to be with the person she loves: Logan whom she accidentally infects with a deadly virus that prevents them from having any physical contact.  Still, they made her character too extreme and thus she crosses over the line into a character that you find you aren't caring as much about.  She loses any sympathy with the audience.

One can hardly wait to get to the series/season finale in which James Cameron takes the helm.  It was sad indeed to see this show canceled.  But does it ever go out with a bang!  It includes one of the best all-out fight scenes that I've ever seen on television.  But at the end, you are left wondering what happens to the transgenics.  There was a lot of room for some great stories to continue the series with.  It is a real shame that we will never know or get to be a part of Max's world.",1125619200,4,3455,4.500805152979066

I liked that they added more characters to the cast. I really enjoyed watching Joshua and Asha. I didn't like the character of Ames White at all. He just wasn't our Lydecker.

I can't believe this show ended with such a cliffhanger. Dark Angel could have at least had a minimum of five seasons.

1867246,5,B00008YGRX,"Such a good show, with great potential for another season. The only thing that James Cameron doesn't have, is the guts to kill off one of the main characters, like on Buffy or especially Angel. That's the only part where he fails, and he never kills the bad guy within the season, they always have to hang around. Dark Angel was very creative, funny at times and dark at other times. Though, Alec made a very good point in Hello, Goodbye, where he says, ""We're not like them, we don't belong with them."" to Max, and of course, he is right. I always thought it was weird for Max to hang with Logan and Cindy, because they don't live in the same worlds. There's no way they can understand what each other are going through, which is why I think Max and Logan could never work out. Max was trained to be a soldier, not a good lover, and she tends to keep to herself, a lot, which is not good for someone like Logan, who probably needs to hear her feelings out loud, it's just my opinion but Max I think, is destined to be alone. I haven't read the books yet, but I did start, this show was brilliant none the less and in no way, should have been cancelled, that's a disgrace and Fox should have brought them back because the books aren't the same as the show, speaking of:

Designate This- 5/5 A great beginning to the second season, where Max is infected with an virus that is set to kill Logan if she touches him. Meanwhile, Max meats Alec(Ben's twin) and Joshua(the dog boy) in a cave

Bag Em'- 4.5/5 The new bad guy arrives to terminate some of the remaining X-5's from when Manticore was blown up in the previous episode, and that bad guy, is Ames White. Martin Cummings is the new and better bad guy. Lydecker was awesome, but he never really seemed like a real bad guy at heart, and it shows near the end of the season where he betrays Manticore, and here is shown helping out Logan. And, Alec is forced to help some of X-5's being hunted.

Proof of Purchase- 5/5 Alec is captured by White and he promises to kill three of his own kind, so White installs a bomb in his neck, not very big, but it will get the job done. Alec has 24 hours to kill 3 transgenics(however you spell that). This was a cool episode!

Radar Love- 4/5 Things get complicated between Logan and Max while some guy working for White tries to kill everyone within the city limits.

Boo- 4.5/5 A dream sequence featuring a headless villain Max must defeat, Logan playing bingo, Normal & Sketchy hunting transgenics and Max denying who she realy is.

Two- 4.5/5 Joshua's old pal is back and killing because he is angry. Kinda a gross episode, but Max and Joshua connect well here.

Some Assembly Required- 4.5/5 Zack is back and has a new arm and eye, in robot function while he works with a bunch of steel heads. Max rescues him but it turns out, Manticore had fed him some stuff about Logan being a traitor, and Zack goes all terminator on Logan.

Gill Girl- 4.5/5 The mermaid story. White tries to get rid of mermaid who happens to be a transgenic.

Medium is the Message- 5/5 White stages a setup to kill his wife and send his son to school, where he can become involved in White's breeding cult.

Brainiac- 5/5 A big guy named Brain, designed to forgettable, oh and psychic(sorta, he uses different words), tries to help Max uncover a traitor amongst the S1W.

The Berrisford Agenda- 5/5 Alec delivers a package with Max to the same place where he killed a girl he loved a few years back, when he worked for Manticore.

Borrowed Time- 4/5 Max finds a temporary cure for the virus, lasts 12 hours but the virus comes back afterwards, meanwhile, Logan meets another transgenic who is captures humans.

Harbour Lights- 5/5 Max gets shot in the crossfire while trying to protect a kid, the CIA makes some great discories about what she is. White tries to cover it up, oh, and tries to kill her too.

Love in Vein- 4/5 A psycho transgenic has people hooked up on his blood, he's building an army. The best part is where Max kicks their girly butts.

Fudgedaboudit- 5/5 It's funny! About a girl named Mia who can hyptnotize people and make them forget everything they told her, she finds out all their darkest secrets(Max is an X-5, Logan is Eyes Only), makes Alec get back into the ring, he kicks everyones butt, until Max decides to take him on. Everyone bets on Monty Cora(aka Alec) while Mia bids everythin on Max.

Exposure- 5/5 White has turned the table and has been working with one of his breeding cult partners to eliminate the transgenics once and for all. Max captures his son.

Hello, Goodbye- 5/5 Logan mindlessly touches Max and goes into the hospital, Alec is captured for a murder his twin commited and Joshua meets a blind girl.

A Dawg Day Afternoon- 4.5/5 Joshua escapes into the sewers with Annie(the blind girl), while he is chased by some punks. They get on the news and all the cops are there. Max is forced to rescue Joshua, while he leaves Annie behind for the cops, but she only finds Ames White.

She Ain't Heavy- 5/5 Max meets her match, X5-453, as she tries to kidnap Max to protect her family. Logan is finally tracked down and White's crew destroys all Logan's equipment. Joshua goes to terminal city, to join the other, so called ""freaks"".

Love Amung the Runes- 4.5/5 And we begin to reach the finally, where war is starting to enrage between humans and transgenics.

Freak Nation- 5/5 A two hour finally, which is really just over an hour, thanks to adds, 20 minutes longer then the regular episodes, and this is where the war really starts.

 A Great season with good special features to keep you going, like a documentary, and the always funny bloopers. Be sure to buy this, a truly classic show!!",1102896000,10,5705,4.433078393881453

it's so obvious that stuntmen help out but the special effects, generally how do u do that.

Dark Angel sits down a building and then they show the tap thinggy on the back of her head we go in and then bam, she's in action.

dark angel was really really good, i don't know why did it end only two seasons.

the first time i saw dark angel i wanted to puke, and then slowly i moved to liking it when i saw the action.

And then i had to love it.

Who ever didn't watch it, buy it now at Amazon.com, Now!",1099785600,2,656,3.8222222222222224

I also like the eposide where Josh meet the sexy blind lady, Why she have to die soon early? I also like Max sexy friend on the show Oringal Cindy, she is hot. I wish they had a season Three. The people over there at FOX are crazy Dark Angel was the best show they had. It was way better then Alis, Buffy the vampire and that boring show people go crazy over FRIENDS i hate friends it sucked, I couldn't relate, where were the black people? We should write FOX and demand that they bring back Dark Angel for one more season, at least let them finish up the book and let Max and Logan finally do the wild thing, you know?!",1092787200,6,776,4.045454545454546
1867249,5,B00008YGRX,"Overall, I enjoyed Season Two of DARK ANGEL, though I still prefer Season One.  Despite the fact that I have a basic problem with Season Two, a large number of things were done very well.  Like Season One, it was a well written, superbly produced, well executed season with some great new characters and some interesting new plot developments.  Above all, Season Two represented a major improvement in Jessica Alba as an actress.  In Season One, there were a host of scenes in which I was depressed by her rather flat vocal delivery and a surfeit of emotion at times when more was called upon.  She is immeasurably better in Season Two, possibly a result of additional training, and certainly a result of being more comfortable in her role.  She impressed with her athleticism in Season One, but she seems even more capable in her fight scenes and stunts in Season Two.  She even seems more beautiful, probably the result of losing just a hint of baby fat (she was, after all, just out of high school in the first season).

The biggest problem I had with Season Two was the amazing lack of continuity with Season One.  Like THE X-FILES or BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER or FARSCAPE, DARK ANGEL is a series that depends on long story arcs.  That was true of both Season One and Season Two, but while each season had a great deal of internal narrative over the course of the season, not quite enough carried over from one season to the next for my taste.  For one thing, a number of characters simply vanished.  John Hurt, who was so prominent in Season One, leaves after a couple of episodes in Season Two (I suspect he would have returned in Season Three).  Max and Original Cindy's coworker and friend Herbal vanishes with nary a word.  The Asian police officer who was so prominent also fades from the scene.  And the brilliant Stephen Hawking-like character (in that he is both brilliant and trapped in a wheelchair) disappears (perhaps because he might have possessed the knowledge to rid Max of the targeted retro virus that keeps her from having any physical contact with Logan) also vanishes into thin air.  On the other hand, we are confronted with a host of new characters, so the feel of Season Two is much different from Season Two.  Also, some of the carryovers from Season One have lessened roles.  We don't see very much of Original Cindy or Sketchy in many episodes, as their onscreen time has been cut into by Alec and Joshua.  On top of this, many of the emphases of Season One are altered to accommodate plot shifts.  For instance, plot lines revolving around Agent White squeeze out many of the humanitarian and justice efforts by Eyes Only.  Or take Max.  In Season One much of the interest revolved around her attempt to find a satisfying life despite the rather unusual hand that fate has dealt her.  She also apparently changed biologically from Season Two, although no specific mention is made of this.  For instance, she had no moments where she needed a quick injection of Tryptophan (again, if her neurological condition was corrected during her incarceration at Manticore, no mention is made), and unlike Season One, she never had a period in Season Two where she went into heat (as a result of her feline DNA).  These changes are all quite separate from changes wrought by plot development.  There were just too many details that got pushed out of the show.  Given the lack of continuity with Season One, I felt slightly uncomfortable with the predominance of Alec, Joshua, and White.  These are not bad characters, but I didn't like to see more familiar elements squeezed out for the inclusion of the newcomers.

Nonetheless, Season Two was overall an exceptionally strong one.  There were very few weak episodes and only one genuinely awful one the absolutely wretched ""Gill Girl,"" which might be the worst single episode of the two seasons.  The more one thinks about the latter episode, the worse it becomes (e.g., the transgenic gill people have gills and lay eggs to have offspring, like fish, but they look human and communicate by cetacean-like vocalizing, which would make them mammals).  I love the way the writers keep painting the transgenics into a corner, and even Logan, so that by the end of the season the identify of all of the transgenics have been revealed, Eyes Only has been exposed and shut down, and Max and all of her friends have literally been driven out of life among non-transgenics.  Max's situation has been radically altered by the end.  One assumes that working at Jam Pony is now impossible (despite Sketchy and even Normal abandoning their prejudice against transgenics).  No more evenings at Crash, no more motorcycling around the city, no more biking.  Even her beloved hot baths might be impossible now.  Clearly, big things were intended for Season Three.

One huge, huge reason for fans of the show to seek out the DVD set, even if they have it recorded on video, is the commentary.  Although we sadly did not get a Season Three, the commentators reveal the major plot details that were anticipated.  For instance, we know that Max was somehow the possible savior for the human race, but we are not sure how.  What about Logan's ability to walk or Max's virus?  They spill the beans.  It doesn't make up for having a full season, but at least they resolve some of the larger questions that might otherwise be eating away at fans.

I am not privy as to why DARK ANGEL was cancelled.  Perhaps the ratings weren't what they had hoped.  Perhaps it was too costly of a show.  In a way, the worst thing that ever happened at FOX was the enormous success of THE X-FILES.  Ever since they have been looking for its replacement, and they kill all shows that don't manage its ratings.  Along the way, they have killed off a string of superb shows, like FIREFLY, WONDERFALLS, and this one.

At some point FOX needs to realize that they are superb as a network at developing great shows, but fail miserably in making commitments to those shows.  As it is, I am afraid to watch or allow myself to become interested in any show that appears on FOX.  Why make a commitment to a show that they themselves won't make a commitment to?  My feeling is that you development a quality product, and then stand by it and promote it until either the show slips in quality or there is a long term demonstrated lack of interest in it.  FOX is to be commended for backing the creation of some great shows, but is to be condemned for failing to support them.",1092096000,106,6492,4.643295354951797
1867250,5,B00008YGRX,I DO NOT KNOW WHY THEY CANACELED THIS SHOW. I WAS AMAZED WITH THE PLOT AND CHARACTERS. TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH GIRLS DO KICK ASS!!!!! I HOPE THEY MAKE IT AT LEAST INTO A MOVIE BECAUSE I MEAN I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOW. IT SEEMED THAT THERE REALLY ARE MUTANTS AND GENETIC ENGINEERING HUMANS LIVING IN OUR WORLD WITH US. THOUGH WE MAY NOT KNOW IF THE GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY CONDUCTING EXPERIMENTS LIKE THAT.,1091664000,2,402,4.373333333333333
1867251,5,B00008YGRX,"Yes, people I do. I like second season more than the first. There's just something about second season. It still had its faults, but overall, most episodes were interesting, exciting, action-packed, and emotional.

 First of all I felt that the characters were much more developed; they had changed quite a bit. As my roommate who watched with me said, ""Max seems, I don't know, 'harder' than last season."" I totally agree. Max is a lot more serious (why wouldn't she be, what with the virus, Ames White, etc.), but I think that was an appropriate change for character, if you take into account the direction the show was going. So many things just started going wrong towards the end of the season for Max, people kept dying on her and she kept feeling guilty about it. It's really great to see how in second season, trial after trial, challenge after challenge, Max is still able to pull through.

 Second, the acting was much better. Characters seemed comfortable with each other; they clicked very well, even Max and Logan, considering (Jessica Alba and Michael Weatherly were engaged by that time, so that probably helped). Every actor was perfect in their roles, especially since many more emotions were at play. Joshua's character is very lovable, and you really feel for him. Alec is awesome, not to mention very good looking, and Jensen Ackles does an excellent job making Alec fit his name (""Alec as in 'smart aleck'."" - Max). He is a refreshing source of comedy in an otherwise serious sci-fi show. Logan is still same old Logan, a guy Max can always depend on, no matter what happens. The virus deal between them really made me mad though. And it sucks that there wasn't a season 3 to wrap up all the questions that were raised this season. But, you can't hold it against them, everybody thought there WAS going to be an S3. Anyway, the producers answer the questions in the last episode commentary - yet another reason to buy this set.

 Third, I thought the general choreography and atmosphere was more realistic. The fight scenes were smoother and more believable, as well as, I thought, more entertaining.

 Now, to the negatives. Not much to say about that. The worst was seeing Max and Logan so close yet so far. It really hurt seeing their relationship on the rocks because of the virus, and the taste made more bitter by the fact that (Spoiler warning)this issue is not resolved at the end of the season (darn FOX). And then there's Alan Cummings playing Ames White. I didn't like how White acted, his style was just too...overdone. Also, I thought the snake cult stuff was a little too out there for my taste. But that's only a few episodes, no biggie. This show is worth watching for the action and character development/relationships alone.

 Dark Angel continues to be my favorite series. The great acting, engaging plot, awesome fight scenes, witty dialogue, strong characters, and emotions this series encompasses is well worth your time to take part in.",1090886400,5,2980,4.757751937984496
1867252,3,B00008YGRX,"So let's see. Season 2 deals with the fallout of Manticore, a Breeder's Cult, and racism against transgenics. My my, how could it get good? You never find out what's up with the breeders cult or even have a final faceoff between Max and White. You don't find out what happens between Max and Logan, or even the Freak Nation for that matter. They never find a cure for the virus Max has. And humanity is still a group of dumb old morons, even after 2000 years of evolution.
Why couldn't they finish this with a happily ever after twist; is that oh so hard to do? Even the creators say there were several disapointments, in the final episode, with their audio commentary. Atleast I know they agree on that. I know I wouldn't mind seeing Amy Dumas and Jessica Alba duke it out again. As for Freak Nation, I say keep on fighting.",1089590400,3,825,4.363636363636363
1867273,5,B00008YGRX,"Having never seen the show when it was originally broadcast, I bought season one and got hooked, so naturally I had to get season two. I had read some negative reviews about this season but after seeing it for myself I realized that those reviews were misleading...
Yes, season two was different in a lot of ways from season one, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment. One big difference was that Lydecker (John Savage) was phased out and replaced by Agent White (Martin Cummins). Although I really liked John in the first season I eventually found Martin to be quite good too. (You really get to hate White after a while!)
Another difference was the advent of the transgenics in season two. Other reviewers have stated that the show became a ""freakshow"" in season two but in my opinion this only happened in the last couple of episodes. Joshua was definitely an interesting character and a good addition to the show. Some of the other transgenics were quite good too, notably ""Mule"" who was in a couple of episodes. (He was cute and I couldn't help but feel sorry for him when he met his fate.)
Some of the new characters I actually preferred to the first season - I found Alec in season two to be very funny and fun to watch, as opposed to Zack from season one who was about as interesting as unbuttered toast...
This season still retained all that made the first season great - the chemistry between Max and Logan, Max's friends at Jam Pony, great action scenes, humor, and even a few genuine sad moments. (However, I was dissapointed that there were no episodes when Max was ""in heat""; I loved those episodes from season one!)
The extras are not quite as good as the first season but still not bad. Another commentary by Jessica and/or Michael would have been nice, as well as more audition footage. (I would have loved to have seen Martin Cummins' audition for Agent White!)

1867276,5,B00008YGRX,"Just finished watching the second season of ""Dark Angel""; purchased both seasons on Amazon.  I had never seen it when it aired, so it was nice to view it all without commercials & continuously.  I really enjoyed both seasons, but I feel that the first season was better; in the second season they went off on some rather bizaare tangents. Unfortunately they lost, for the most part, the character of Lydecker, who was a multi-dimensional character with many as yet unexplored aspects.  He was unfortunately replaced with a comic villain, White.  There were times when I wondered how the other actors kept a straight face playing opposite him; this seemed somewhat out of place to the tone of the program in general.
While I understand that it is necessary to keep the love interests apart(in true soap opera tradition), I felt that the virus keeping apart Logan & Max was bogus; it seemed too obviously to be a plot device & didn't come from a true place but the worst, in my opinion, was the breeding cult episodes, which recalled every bad cliche about Satan worshippers that you ever saw in any 1970's ""Movie of the Week"". (Hey, just because they're devil-worshippers doesn't mean they're freaks!) Beyond that this is a great show; very enjoyable & watchable; it's unfortunate that it was cancelled, and I agree with other comments that it would be nice to see how this all came out, maybe in a follow-up movie.",1080777600,2,1414,4.735772357723577
1867277,3,B00008YGRX,"Like most people, I missed most of the original episodes of Dark Angel when it was on the air. This six-DVD set is a great value if you were a fan of the series, and Dark Angel's one of my guilty pleasures. As TV sci-fi goes, this isn't half-bad. Sure, it isn't the most original of premises, but most sci-fi nowadays is recycled. In Dark Angel's favor, most of the leads are attractive, have an excellent rapport, and are capable of delivering necessary comic relief without coming across as campy. If Jessica Alba (Max)had better management, she could have had the world at her feet following the premature cancellation of this series, and Michael Weatherly deserves a lot of credit for consistently underplaying his role as Logan, the do-gooding hacker/pirate broadcaster of Seattle. Most of the episodes are very easy to watch for these reasons. However, this is basically a live-action comic book, and the scripts vary wildly in quality. Some provide great action and characterization, and some are just stupid. Lead villain Ames White came across as a cipher- obsessed one minute, buffoonish the next, partly due to the lack of care shown to the scripts. As the season progressed, Dark Angel mutated into a cross between the X-men and the X-files (both are also Fox productions, naturally)and lost its identity. Although the budgets were quite high, they weren't high enough to present plausible effects makeup. That's a problem when you have a series featuring mutants as characters. I honestly don't see how Season Three could have undone some of the sillier aspects of Season Two (such as the snake cult, and the freak nation) so perhaps it's best that we said goodbye to Max and Logan when we did, instead of watching the series suffer. We'll always have these DVDs to enjoy, and we can wish the cast (especially Alba and Weatherly) the best of luck in their future endeavors.",1078531200,,1886,4.8602484472049685

The second season opened the series up and by the end had great promise for stories. As the season ended I looked forward to the next year and what could be done with the various characters and situations. That the idiots that cancelled are probably the same ones that dropped the hammer on Homicide and other potentially great shows.

This dvd also features some cool behind the scenes featurettes..But the Blooper reel is not as well put together as the first season's was..This blooper reel is badly put together and very hard to follow..Therefore making it not funny at all..But that is the only downside to this remarkable dvd set..It is packaged well with a sexy cover of our Dark Angel ""Max"" played by the Magically Beautiful Jessica Alba..The packaging beats the packaging of the first one..I always felt the first one could have been packaged better..
  I also have to note this season has a great new character addition..That is of the Manicore Mutant known as ""Joshua""..He is half dog half man..And harks back to great sci fi characters of the past..The actor that plays him is very talented and that makeup you would never even recognize him..His character is kind and shows the fact not to judge people on their looks..The ol don't judge a book by its cover..A true lesson for our day and age..A lesson to be learned by all races all genders and all religions..Joshua as well as other mutants kinda adds a X-Men feel to this season..This season is very much like the X-Men..It is like Dark Angel Meets The X-Men..Joshua has a feel of ""Nightcrawler"" vibe from X2..(Xmen Reunited)..There are also some elements to Buffy and Xfiles in this season as well..Another fine addition to the show is the character of ""Alec""..He is named Alec by Max coz he is a total ""smart~alec""..And that he is..He is a wise ass wise cracking character that you really don't know whether can trust him or not..And what comes from it is a powerful character mostly when he is teamed up with Alba..
There is between them a chemistry great timing of one liners insults and that sort of thing..
  Highlights in Season 2 Dark Angel are the first episode ""Designate This"" in which the cliffhanger that ended off the first season is concluded..In matter of fact all that is on disc 1 is highlights..Other ones are ""BOO"" an Halloween episode that harks to the loony comedy of ""Buffy"" and the movie ""Army of Darkness""..Its silly and fun the ending will suprise you too..Halloween fun..""TWO"" which is where Joshua is accused of some very grosume murders..But he is innocent of course..But who did it?? Have to watch to see..""Some assembly required"" is a reunion of Max and someone *not saying who so not to ruin the suprise*..This episode contains a gang of cyber punks called ""steelheads""..Their leader is a combination of Spike from Buffy & Johnny Rotton of the Sex Pistols and Pinhead of the HeLLraiser movies..They are english wise cracking punks and result is fun villians..""Gill Girl"" this one may be the best episode of the season features a hot Mermaid girl and her Merman lover..The ending is magically mystically beautifully filmed..""Brainiac"" is an episode that is very memorable with a very good performance by a heavy actor that makes a good addition to the show..Watch for the FUNNY scene where he is on a motorcycle with Max (Alba) i think i speak for every man that i can't blame him..The ending will really hit the viewer hard ""Berrisford Agenda"" that episode has also the same kind of ending as the previous..And concerns Alec's past love as he is being haunted by her memory..You see a different side of Alec that is not shown very much..The actress that plays his past love is stunningly beautiful and a very talented actress shines in this guest star apperance..""Harbor Lights"" Max gets shot trying to protect a little boy..And in the hospital she is held prisoner by the government for the virus that was implanted in her by Manticore to keep Her and Logan apart is detected..Can they get Max out of there before they discover who and what she is?? ""Love In Vein"" is more like an episode of Buffy then Dark Angel..As Max battles a gang of Vampire Wanna Be's..Headed by a Manicore Vampire making his gang of followers drink from his genitically enhanced blood..The way that he makes them drink of his blood is done in a complete original way never seen of any vampire on film / tv before..A brilliant idea of the writters to come up with that one Bonus Points..""Fuhgeddaboudit"" (pronouced ""forget about it"") is one of the best episodes here..Featuring an actress (don't know her name but she puts me in mind of Christina Ricci) who is by far one of the sexiest guest star apperances i have seen in recent years..
She will totally blow you away..She is also a Manticore Creation that has the power to make people forget things..Another one that has an X-Men feeling to it..Personally one look into her eyes would have power on me and forgetting isn't one of them..Don't miss this episode and this magical performance by this mystery actress..""Hello,Goodbye"" in which i can subtitle as ""Love Sucks""..It involves Joshua befriending and falling for a blind girl..As well as something coming to a head in the relationship of Max and Logan..A song comes to mind for this episode the song is ~If You Love Someone Set Them Free~ By Sting..These highlights mentioned covers the first 5 discs in the set..I won't write about any on the 6th *final* disc..Coz want to be sure not to give ending away..All i will say in that realm is that there should be more to the story..Maybe Fox will give them a chance to do a movie or something to finish it up..A finish that this show the stars and the fans all deserve...
  And i must stress don't watch this season til you have seen the first season..Coz if this is viewed first you will be totally lost..Mostly with the cliffhanger that ended off the first season it is continued in true cliffhanger climax form in the first episode of this season 2 of Dark Angel..
  I can't write this without exspressing the greatness and beauty of Jessica Alba..She is truly beautiful and very talented actress and again in this season she shines through and through every step of the way..And there is no girl on tv and/or movies today that can wear leather as well as tight blue jeans like she can..HOT HOT HOT!!!!!!
  So when it comes to this season don't believe the hype..Watch it and i am sure you will agree that this season stands well side by side with first season at times beating it.. You also get in this season delivery of wild & funny one liners..Though not as heavy with it then the first season..But Alba is a great one liner..One liners harken to that one would hear on BuFFy..It would have been great to see Alba's Max team up with the scoobies on BuFFy..There are a few low points but are few & almost un-noticeable..Give it a chance you will be more then satisfied..What a show and What a star Jessica Alba as we say ""Don't call Jessica Alba ~Pocahontas~ Call Her ""Pocahottie""..",1076284800,4,8513,4.657351962741184
1867280,3,B00008YGRX,"First season was depressing in that it depicted a dark, dismal future America, this second season is depressing in that the writers/producers threw away so much of what I liked about the first one.
Jessica Alba's Max is still the smart mouthed 20 yr. old or so Jam Pony employee out to secretly make the world just a little bit better but that is most of what didn't change. First season gradually got away from the Manticore X5's needing tryptophan supplements to survive and being prone to sudden rapid aging (no explanation given, they just dropped the ideas)but on the whole Season One stayed pretty consistent.
Second season starts off where First ended with Max a captive at Manticore after a rescue attempt of those her group of escapees left behind. As the season progresses we find that many of the secondary characters (including Lydecker)have dissappeared without much if any explanation and Max is now some sort of super X5 with no junk DNA.
For some reason the producers/writers felt the need to introduce characters that are more animal than human and a hitherto secret race of superhumans out to rule the world. A character called ""Father"" is mentioned but described as long missing, apparently he designed Max to save everything in the future, I was never sure if maybe he might've been one of these super men.
I guess ratings got so bad that by season's end producer James Cameron came in to do the season finale, it was interesting but Ms. Alba was about all that was any good in it.
I remember that it was a toss-up over whether Dark Angel would have a third season( the sloppy finale left us hanging)or Joss Whedon's Firefly would take it's place. I don't think Dark Angel would've lasted much longer than Firefly did.",1075248000,4,1738,4.720394736842105

In watching the last few episodes, you can really see how the pace of the story is picking up.  I admit that the creepy breeding cult seemed to be a diversion from the heart of the story, but at the same time, I think it was necessary to explain why Max was created.  I also admit that some of the episodes were a bit diversionary and didn't really add much to the heart of where the story should have been going (not more than 3 or 4, I'd say), but as a whole, it was a great season.  From reading the three novels, it's clear that in the third season, it might have taken maybe two episodes to rid us of the breeding cult and Ames White (although I personally thought Martin Cummins was quite good, though really, nobody beats Lydecker, who also would have returned, if they'd given the show a third season, I suspect).  But it's so unfair.  Lesser shows have been on the air, and yes, on Fox, for far longer.  Why must the good ones die young??  If only they would give them one more chance.

Unfortunately, this set (like the first season) is only available in a pan and scan version, thanks to the idiots at FOX.  The show gets a decent rating, but the DVD sucks because of this format.  If something's filmed in 16:9, it should be presented in 16:9.  This so called ""Full Screen"" version does NOT fill my 16:9 screen, and (if it doesn't affect you now) when you have a 16:9 TV in the future, it will.",1073952000,5,567,4.311320754716981
1867303,4,B00008YGRX,"While the first season of Dark Angel was more consistent, the second season offered much more interesting developments for the unproduced third season to fulfill. As it is, we'll be stuck with an unresolved cliff hanger (unless the Dark Angel novels somehow resolve this--I've not read any of them). Captured by Manticore the entity that created her and other mutants, Max escapes and initiates the destruction of the organization. Suddenly, she isn't as alone as during the first season; she owes her life to Alec another X5 similar to her and a DNA mixed breed (he's part human, part canine)named Joshua. With Manticore destroyed, it seems like smooth sailing for Max and others of her kind. Unfortunately, there's a new threat pursuing her and her fellow X5's and X6's.
While season two's episodes are ripe with possibility, those possibilities aren't developed as well as they could be; The shift of focus in the series with Manticore gone helps emancipate the show from the variation on The Fugitive theme. Dark Angel always echoed that series and Run For Your Life another series from the 1960's (which Cameron no doubt was a fan of and saw). Cameron and co-creator Charles Eglee chose a different path from those series realizing the limits one can run into in terms of plot developments and story arcs. The best episodes hold their own and, in some cases, are superior even to the best from the first season. That said, the quality varies a bit more here than the first season because the focus isn't quite as sharp.
Actor John Savage is missed. Although his character could be one dimensional in the early episodes of season one, as the series progressed, Savage brought an undercurrent of tension to the series with his moody, subtle portrayal. On the other hand, Alba and Weatherly continued to improve bringing nice shading to their characters and their interactions.
The grand finale for season two has considerable pedigree; it's based on a story by Cameron and Eglee but written by Deep Space Nine and Fame producer/writer Ira Steven Behr one of the finest writers working in television. He and co-writer/series line producer Rene Echevarria (another Deep Space Nine and Next Generation veteran)created the best episode of the season with Freak Nation. The real icing on the cake for Cameron and Dark Angel fans is the fact that Cameron directed this 90 minute episode himself. He's been MIA from film for far too long.
The extras are similar to the previous season--commentary on three key episodes (although Cameron does not appear on the commentary track for Freak Nation)including the season premiere and the final episode. There's three featurettes including a piece on creating the monsters of Manticore and one self explainatory feaurette entitled Max Resurrected. The amusing blooper reel is included as well. Although there's no revealing interviews with Cameron or Eglee (which would have been nice--we might have found out what direction they planned on taking the series during season three), the commentary tracks give considerable insight into the creative process for the show.
The DVD picture quality varies from good to very good depending upon what time of the day the bulk of the episode takes place in. The darker episodes tend to show a bit more digital compression artifacts. The series looks and sounds really good on the whole. I do have an issue with the packaging; Fox has embraced the accordion style packaging included here and it sucks; the quality of the packaging is poor. The plastic DVD holders continually come loose or pop out and the packaging doesn't stand up well to wear and tear. Fox should have taken a look at the Alias boxed set as an example for this series. Both series are priced roughly the same (and considerably less than any of the Star Trek boxed sets--kudos for that at least) so clearly this comes down to profit margin. Extras are nice and do attract fans to purchase a series vs. continually watching their videotaped or DVD-R home made recordings. On the other hand, three featurettes, 3 commentary tracks and the blooper reel isn't exactly might not be enough incentive for most fans to fork over the additional money for this set. I'm sure that Dark Angel had footage shot for foreign markets (different standards and running times demand these types of differences be created). Why not research it and include those as well? Although they usually don't have additional major plot points, they're, again, an added incentive to purchase this for fans of the series. These are minor flaws to be sure (although the packaging is a major issue for me)but it would enhance the value of the series and, perhaps, increase sales.
Although the show began to lose their core audience during season one and two, if Fox had continued to give this series a chance I've not doubt it could have turned into another X-Files for the network. As a fan of the first five seasons of X-Files, I found Angel to be in roughly the same place by season two although the writing was better earlier with this series. Hopefully, Fox will come to their senses and order at least a two hour series to conclude the show at some point although this late in the game (over a year later)it's unlikely to happen; the sets were struck and the cast is scattered all over the place. It's a pity because this cult series deserved the chance to shine and with a little TLC it had a pretty good chance of happening.",1072569600,19,5446,4.850698174006444
1867304,5,B00008YGRX,"i think the second season of Dark Angel is fantastic.  Jessica Alba never fails to put on a beautiful performance, both by acting and looks.  she is such a good example of a woman who i want to become in life: capable to take care of herself and be in the lead, yet have a true sweetness and purity that isn't feighned at all.  you can see it in her smile and hear it in her laugh.  its amazing. michael weatherly does a fantasic job as logan and they are definately up there with buffy and angel for the best TV romance and couple.  they both share one word: forbidden.  yet, nomatter what happens, they always come through for eachother.  i think the last scene in Freak Nation, where they hold hands is so incredible.  to me, it means that, yes, their bodies cannot touch, but their hearts are.  both of their hearts are touching and will always be touching; the heart is one.  and i love how they both give eachother's hands a little squeeze because it shows that they will always cling to eachother and i for one, think they make a great couple.  i am very upset that Fox cancelled it, but it is a great show and i definately recommend it, along with season one of course.  also, michael always looks beyond hot throughout season 1 and 2.  altogther he is mouth-watering to look at.  he is in great shape and his face is art work.  and original cindy and newcomer Alec(who's also HOT!) Normal and Sketch are great too.  they are very funny and sincere and i really feel the whole gang got a lot closer.  to me, the series finalle, was an end to a chapter, not the whole book, which really symbolizes life, because life itself doesn't ever end like a book, so i think to myself: why not make TV real?  and dark angel does so.  oh, one more thing: joshua, great character too.",1071014400,3,1779,4.304216867469879
1867305,5,B00008YGRX,"I loved the season one of Darkangel and I missed s2 almost completely, but lucky me, there are DVD's for sale.
I've heard many times that this season is doomed to dissapoint, but I have only one thing to reply: ITS GREAT! And there are improvements. Especially the new caracter Alec (Jensen Ackles)  who's being sarcastic all the time.(tell me this isn't funny:
Max: ""We gonna have to distract them.""
Alec: ""Tell me you're going to get naked."")
 Jessica Alba does another great job, being Max, the tough I-don't-need-anyone kickass. Logan (Michael Weatherly) is being very irritating (In a good way!) as miracle-computer-boy and I even like Johsua, the dog guy. Though, like any other series, this one isn't completely perfect. I found the virus thing quite unbelieveble, though it saves us from a Max/Logan soap cliche. And, yes I have to admit it: Logan's hair really looks bad. And the same goes for his glasses, they just don't look right on him.
But even these little things can't prevent me from giving it 5 stars.",1070323200,3,1020,4.7897727272727275
1867306,4,B00008YGRX,"Watching the second season of ""Dark Angel"" knowing that the show would be cancelled it becomes easier to see that there the fundamental dynamic of the series was just changed way too much.  After all, gone is John Savage's villainous Lydeker, who had at least a proprietary interest in the transgenics.  In his place is a Snidley Whiplash type, Agent White (Martin Cummins), who wants to kill all the transgenics, not so much because of orders from the government but because of a much larger ancient conspiracy (e.g, ""Exposure"") having to do with the whole eugenics vs. transgenics argument (pretend there is one).  Instead of the super-soliders from the X-5 series trying to blend in with humanity and avoid being killed by their creators, we know have transgenics of every description, which far too often becomes a ""freak"" of the week.  While in the case of Joshua (Kevin Durand), the first transgenic, this has some nice payoffs, the rest of it is just becomes a bit much and you need a program to keep all the transgenic clear in your mind.

Then there is the whole romantic relationship between Max (Jessica Alba) and Logan (Michael Weatherly), which starts off the second season with him thinking she is dead.  Then he gets the good news, she is alive, but the bad news: she has been given a virus that is genetically programmed to kill Eyes Only.  You have to admit, it terms of keeping apart two people who seriously want to get together, this is a rather creative way, and there are a couple of very good episodes dealing with their romantic problems (e.g., ""Borrowed Time,"" ""Hello, Goodbye"").  We are supposed to then throw X-5 Alex (Jensen Ackles) into the mix as a love triangle, but I can never believe Sam would be unfaithful to Logan, let along want to go the kissing cousin route.  I prefer the problems with the X-6s (""Bag 'Em"") and the X-7s (""Designate This"").

Perhaps the best proof of how the show was matching steps forwards with step backwards is in the supporting cast.  With Alex and Joshua becoming the third and fourth most important characters in the show after Max and Logan, that meant reduced roles for Original Cindy (Valarie Rae Miller) and Norman (J.C. MacKenzie).  The latter is reduced to on-going homoerotic shtick with Alex, especially in the Manty Coro bits, and the former is reduced to popping in to episodes for brief moments of clear thinking and moral support.  This is underscore by their return to prominence in the series finale, ""Freak Nation"" (raise your hand if the final scene reminds you of a line from CSN&Y's ""Deja Vu"").

Perhaps the problems with Season 2 of ""Dark Angel"" is that making things bigger and going the whole ""X-Men"" route with the public outcry to get the wicked mutants, is just pretty much a complete flip on the more intimate and secretive world of post-Pulse Seattle we got in Season 1 (and if you listen to the commentary track for ""Freak Nation"" you can learn what further changes were coming in Season 3).  It seems strange to fault a show for moving in new directions, given how often they become stagnant, but all these changes might just have been too much too soon.  Then again, the fault might be audiences were not particularly open to so many changes.  You certainly cannot say that watching Alba as Max got tiresome (just her comic book refusal to ever kill any of the homicidal maniacs after her and her buddies).

Ironically, FOX's reasoning for cancelling ""Dark Angel"" was that they did not want to do two futuristic science-fiction shows (i.e., costly sets and special effects), and decided to go with the highly anticipated sci-fi western ""Firefly"" from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" creator Joss Whedon.  Of course, ""Firefly"" never had the ratings of ""Dark Angel"" and never made it to double figures on aired episodes.  If you missed ""Dark Angel,"" then it is certainly worthwhile checking it out on DVD.  The second season is not as good as the first, but still way above average in terms of science fiction shows.  James Cameron directed the finale, which marked the first (and so far only) time he has dealt with human actors as a director since ""Titanic.""  The DVD also includes some featurettes and a gag reel, but the chief attraction in the extras are the few but definitely above average commentary tracks.",1070064000,75,4301,4.751344086021505
1867307,3,B00008YGRX,"Series 1 of Dark Angel was original, & not so completely removed from reality that you thought ""that couldn't  possibly happen"", & that's one of the reasons I liked it.
Series2, sadly in my opinion, removes itself completely from reality.
We find that Manticore (the genetic engineering facility that created our heroine, Max) had created all sorts of creatures, from dog men to panther women.  And then there's the ""breeding cult"" storyline, in which we have people that are even more dangerous than the transgenics, but were just bred that way (possibly with alien help, but we never really get this resolved).
Series 2 does have some good points - the character of Alec is great fun, & really cute, & we get to see William Gregory Lee reprise his role as Zack, however it all just got too strange & moved away from why I liked Dark Angel in the first place.
Stll, I was sorry when they cancelled it, & I would love to see a movie made to tie up all the loose ends.",1069891200,5,967,4.4576271186440675
1867308,3,B00008YGRX,"This second season of Dark Angel, while it had a fair amount of good episodes,  wasn't as strong as the first, which was refreshing and original both in terms of stories and cast. The second season opens with the destruction of Manticore, but a re-tooling probably did it in. Characters such as Joshua (can you say, Beauty and the Beast) Aisha (featuring an as yet unknown Ashley Scott, whose Huntress character in Birds of Prey was far superior), and Alec (a strong point) seemed to be just plunked down for plot devices, and the lack of Jam Pony storylines made for a general lackluster season. The Halloween episode was  throwaway filler, and Lydecker being reduced to a neutral presence was also a negative.  Pick it up if you are a devoted fan of Jessica Alba and the show, but get your feet wet with the first season if you plan on making an investment ,and decide from then if you need them all.",1067817600,6,902,4.521472392638037
1867309,3,B00008YGRX,"The first season of Dark Angel created a colorful and unusual world, establishing itself as an exceptional, memorable TV creation.  Season 2, unfortunately, seems to draw from a multitude of pre-existing sources and the mix is not all that harmonious.
FIrst of all, I am really not fond of the use of mythology in this season.  The first season, like most of the James Cameron oeuvre, draws its strength from the scientific feasibility of its sci-fi/fantasy elements.  But Season 2 throws in dog-faced mutants, mermaids, scale-bodied monsters, and most grievously, a snake cult spewing arcane language.  What is this, Buffy the Vampire Slayer?  The new tone is entirely incongruous with the world of Dark Angel.
The cast suffers tons of massive losses.  This despite the addition of the wonderful Jensen Ackles, who provides much-needed spark as irresponsible, smart-mouthed X5 Alec, a much better, more complex character than Ackles' Season 1 character Ben.  Ashley Scott is also fine as Logan's alternative love interest Asha, a hot-blooded activist without much gift for tactics.  But they can't make up for the loss of Alimi Ballard (boo), John Savage (big boo), the diminished role of indispensable Valarie Rae Miller, and the disappearance of every
old X5 that was in Season 1.  Where are Syl and Krit?  Jase?  How about the oft-mentioned but absent Jondy?  And what about the entire Jam Pony staff, which used to supply a hefty portion of the comic relief in Season 1 but is neatly swept to the side in this Season?  The creators of Dark Angel appear to be deliberately changing the setting of the show, which is an admirable attempt, but the loss of so many grounding elements sent the show into a tailspin.  Their neglect of the Jam Pony element is especially grievous, as it robbed Jessica Alba the chance to play Max's crucial everyday living.  Fortunately Alba had grown substantially as an actress and while her performance in Season 1 had some weak spots, they are all but remedied in Season 2.
The same can't be said for much of the supporting cast, headed by the very bad Martin Cummins, playing Special Agent Ames White.  I know the show creators wanted a highly vicious villain, but Cummins seems more preoccupied with pursing his lips and squinting his eyes than acting, copying all of John Savage's outward mannerisms without any of the mystique.  Where Savage was all subtext and emotional undercurrents, Cummins is nothing but a pair of black eyebrows and some creases on the face.  A horrible opponent indeed for Max.  The character of ""Joshua"", the dog-faced mutant, doesn't come alive until the season is nearly over, with the introduction of blind love interest Annie Fisher.  Joshua's character is a flatline for most of this season, like an imitation of Booga (Tank Girl), but not nearly as funny.
The biggest problem with this season is that the storylines are scattered and confusing.  Many shows seem to have an overlong first act and a middle that drags along without much narrative thrust.  Where I sat through Season 1 almost straight through, I started yawning about five episodes into Season 2 and was tempted more than once to switch off an episode halfway to cop some Zs.
Not nearly as good as Season 1.  A shame, for the major weaknesses here are probably what killed a promising TV series.  Just when James Cameron himself was stepping in to deliver a slam-bang final episode that set up a whole new story direction.  Now the storyline will hang in midair.",1067040000,26,3496,4.884745762711864
1867310,5,B00008YGRX,"An X5 capable of running faster than bullets, a dog boy strong enough to break a man in two, a pair of star crossed lovers fighting against a world trying to rip them apart.  Welcome to the world of Dark Angel.  This six disc set resurrects the second season of Dark Angel in all its glory.
Like its predecessor, the second season DVD set comes in a fold out package with a neon blue and black color scheme.  The color scheme complements the theme and atmosphere of the show well.  Aside from the extreior packaging, the episodes are professionally transferred.  Colors are accurate and vibrant.  Each episode comes in its original 4:3 aspect ratio, but with a newly created Dolby Surround audio.  There are 3 audio tracks: English, Spanish and French, each in Dolby Surround, with subittles to match.
All 21 episodes are of course, included with a total running time of 943 minutes.  Echoing the season 1 feature set, season 2 also includes 3 audio commentaries.  Commentary episodes are:
Episode 01: Designate This
Episode 11: The Barrisford Agenda
Episode 21: Freak Nation
The commentary provides some interesting insights into how the episode was made, the challenges involved, and the different considerations that were factored in.
In addition, there are also 3 short featurettes:
- Max Resurrected
- Making the Manticore Monsters
- Manticore on the loose
and a blooper reel.
Some of the information between the three featurettes were redundant.  But overall, the provided for enjoyable viewing.  One complaint over the extra featurettes is that they were a little short.  ""Max Resurrected"" was of decent length.  It talks about the thought process that went into the storylines which drove Season 2.  Making the manticore monsters detailed the process of creating the monster of the week customes, and taking some focus on the Joshua makeup.  This featurrete was only about 7 minutes, if that.  Still, the informaton covered wsa interesting.  The last featurette was disappointing.  It offered new information but was merely a music video of sorts of different scenes from the second season that lasted a mere 1:44 seconds.
The blooper reel was pretty decent, though be warned that it was not delivered in DVD quality video.  Nevertheless, it was fun watching the invincible max, always ready with a witty reparte, screw up her lines time and time again.
Despite a few shortcomings, for a mere 42 dollars, this DVD set is a steal and really serves to commenorate a great show that is Dark Angel.",1066694400,4,2502,4.956834532374101

There is alot of quality action sequences and overall wonderful acting by Jessica Alba and Michael Weatherly.  It's a fast-paced show and each and every episode of season 1 was interesting to me and held my attention.  Alot of the storylines in each episode tie together with other episodes which makes it even more worthwhile to watch and more interesting.
  The boxed set was put together nicely, especially considering the low price(compared to other boxed sets).

1867337,5,B00008YGRX,"Forward thinking, edgy sci-fi.  Bladerunner/ Max Headroom with an intelligent female lead. Current science concepts.
I was impressed that the show made use of a sharp writing style, presenting it's characters as smart, flawed emotionally driven beings.
 Despite having very attractive women in the lead roles, the writers/director didn't stupe to skimpy costumes for titilation. Sexual innuendo was mostly absent. Yet the show maintained an witty comedy element.
I found Max to be a much stronger female empowerment roll model for young women than ""Buffy"" or ""Alias"" provided. Despite her ""genetic advantages"" due to her character's history, she and her friends at work still had to deal with an unjust society with which many underprivileged viewers could identify. And her ""Manitcore"" brothers and sisters faced racism in a way we all could be sympathetic towards.
Poor programming choices during the second season made it difficult to keep track of the show. I was truely sorry to see it end without a satisfying conclusion. Perhaps a made-for-cable movie on the Sci-Fi channel could bring closure to this fine offering.",1059004800,9,1123,5.303370786516854
