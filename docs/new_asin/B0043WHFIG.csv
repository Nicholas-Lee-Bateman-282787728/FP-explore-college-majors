8415374,4,B0043WHFIG,"OK, I admit, I was put off by the cover design which is lacking in aesthetic merit. A subtitle would make this title much easier to find. I wish a different self-portrait or a different cropping had been chosen. The font could have been better, much better. Enough with the blu swoosh as all blu-plastic cases give us the clue that it's blu. And the 1080 blurb would look fine, maybe, on the back or the cellophane wrapper. Also, I may be mistaken but the presentation is in 1080i rather than 1080p -- either way it still looks great.

But you can't judge a documentary by its cover. And this documentary is quite good. It makes a good compliment to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Van-Gogh-A-Brush-with-Genius-IMAX-Blu-ray/dp/B0041I97C4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Van Gogh: A Brush with Genius (IMAX) [Blu-ray</a>] (a very well done French IMAX documentary) but is more than three times its length which enables this one to dig a bit deeper into Vincent's life. This is done in a factual albeit *dry* manner -- however it *is* richly illustrated with Vincent's writings, drawings and canvasses and that makes it worth the trip. I learned some new (to me) information about Vincent -- his travels and travails and triumphs.

8415375,2,B0043WHFIG,"Van Gogh is one of my favorite artists, but this is just not a good representation, at all.

This won't be a great review, but, it's not a great dvd, so I don't feel like I'm doing any disservice here. The information on Van Gogh is lacking. They never really go into details about much of his troubles, only talking of his relationship with his brother, Theo, and even that is sugar coated a bit. It's very slow, and quite dry. The info contained in this dvd can be browsed over on any hacked version of Van Gogh's life. Everything here (and more) can be read on wiki for free! In my opinion, this dvd really doesn't do Van Gogh's legacy any justice. As a fan it's extremely disappointing to know that someone somewhere might watch this as an introduction to his life and work, and be sorely disappointed. I'm not an art critic, but I know what I like, and this dvd is not on that list!",1370390400,2,887,4.279761904761905
