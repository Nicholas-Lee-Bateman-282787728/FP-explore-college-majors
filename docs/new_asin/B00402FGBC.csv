4237695,5,B00402FGBC,"Good selection of war movies here for a great price.  But was a bit surprised because my packaging and the dvd markings indicated that one disc in the set contains ""Attack"" and ""Submarine X-1"" when in fact the movies on the disc are actually ""The One That Got Away"" and ""Carve Her Name With Pride.""  No complaints through.  Both of the ""surprise"" movies are excellent and really enjoyed them both!  So just don't be surprised if you buy this set and get the same ""switcheroo surprise"" I did.  If you really want ""Attack"" and/or ""Submarine X-1"" you may not get them.",1303689600,14,565,4.554455445544554

8411690,5,B00402FGBC,"This is a great set of MGM War films ranging from 1956-1991. There are six disks with ""Battle of Britain"" and ""Mission of the Shark"" on there own disks and the rest are on the rest that are double sided. This set does provide closed-caption and I think it does have subtitles too. Now I got the set that has ""Submarine X-1"" and ""Attack!"" so I can't review on ""Carve Her Name with Pride"" and ""The One That Got Away"" that have been also added to this set also.

Movies included are:
-Battle of Britain (1969/Widescreen/color/132mins)
Harry Andrews, Michael Caine, Trevor Howard, Curt Jergens, Laurence Olivier; Directed by Guy Hamilton

8411691,5,B00402FGBC,"We looked at the other reviews before placing our order, and were slightly concerned.  We really wanted ""Shark: Saga of the Indianapolis"" for our collection.  Happily, all the listed titles arrived with our order.  All the DVD's played just fine, and we're very content with this item!",1345420800,,285,5.0212765957446805
8411692,5,B00402FGBC,"OK, so these 10 films are a mixed bag; the only one I would have passed on is Beach Red.  There are some very good movies (Battle of Britain, Bridge at Remagen, Force 10 from Navarone, Submarine X-1, etc.), and these alone make this set a great value.  The other films are lesser known, such as the McKenzie Break, but still well worth watching.  Overall, an interesting set and good value:  10 films for less than $2 a film!

The only complaint I have is the packaging.  Most of the films are double sided, which is OK, but the way the plastic holders work, it's a bit tricky to put them back firmly into place, so that they don't roll around (and get scratched) in the case.",1308614400,5,676,4.283464566929134
