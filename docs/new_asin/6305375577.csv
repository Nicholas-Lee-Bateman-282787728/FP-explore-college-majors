1016883,5,6305375577,"Channel surfing is a wonderful thing sometimes. Especially when you happen to come across movies with fantastic thriller plots. Many other reviews have compared this film to Dead Man on Campus and given this a low rating strictly because of its rehashed plot from Dead Man on Campus. I haven't seen the other film and it doesn't really matter to me because The Curve (a.k.a. Dead Man's Curve) was amazing.

The Curve's plot revolves around a supposed mythical rule that many universities have, known as the Pass by Catastrophe policy; that when a college student's roommate commits suicide; they can take an automatic 4.0 GPA for the remainder of the semester. The Curve's plot centers around 3 college students; Tim Jackson (Matthew Lillard), Chris, and Rand who are campus roommates. Tim and Chris have been dying to get into Harvard for years and figure that a perfect 4.0 GPA will help them get there. They secretly devise a plan to kill Rand and make it look like a suicide. They put the plan into motion one night at a party when Rand gets into a nasty argument with his girlfriend, Natalie; upon discovering she's pregnant.

With Rand successfully out of the picture; Tim and Chris receive their 4.0s and look forward to their bright future.....or at least so they think. With a police investigation fully under way; emotions run high, guilt begins to set in, lies are being told left and right, and as the tension builds up; Chris and Tim aren't even sure they can trust each other. Just when these friends thought they knew each other; trust is soon thrown out the window as well and the plot of an even bigger scheme at work is being slowly unraveled; one sinister truth...or lie at a time

Overall: The Curve deserves nothing less than 5 stars. The story-telling beginning, middle, and end is intense and keeps your attention focused on the film all the way throughout; keeping you interested in wondering what's going to happen next. The best part about this movie is that it takes so many twists and turns, it's completely unpredictable as to what happens next, who's the true ""good guy"" in all this, and how it will all end. Matthew Lillard who played the role as the admirable but psychotic murdered; Stu in Scream; plays yet another demented role in The Curve as the perverse, twisted, calculating Tim Jackson. Want an unpredictable, eyes on the screen movie with twists left and right to add to your collection? Choose The Curve! You won't be disappointed. I wasn't",1419379200,,2482,4.7540603248259865

1016890,5,6305375577,"When I was in college, the story was that you got a 4.0 if your roommate died, but now it seems that said roommate actually has to kill himself/herself for the rule to apply.  Of course, no one actually believed this urban myth (thank goodness - my first roommate was an avid hunter).  According to The Curve (also known as Dead Man's Curve), however, most state universities actually have this rule in place - and it's not exactly a secret.  That being the case, it was only a matter of time before someone exploited this little loophole for his/her own gain.

Don't worry about having pity for the poor victim of this little scheme, for Rand (Randall Batinkoff) is inherently unlikable - he's a slick and spoiled child of great wealth who treats everyone around him like dirt, especially his mousy girlfriend Natalie (Tamara Craig Thomas).  Despite this, his two roommates don't really hate him.  Chris (Michael Vartan) is just desperate to get into Harvard grad school and Tim (Matthew Lillard) - well, Tim's just messed up in the head.  You may remember Matthew Lillard from his role in Scream; he's playing the same kind of psychotic character here - only more psychotic and even more brutish and annoying.  Chris is no genius, either, having believed that killing Rand and making it look like suicide would be a simple act to pull off.  Serious repercussions - and major plot twists - follow in the wake of his and Tim's actions.

The Curve is an odd little film.  Early on, it even seems to have some comedic aspirations - take, for instance, the guys' pre-murder field trip to procure Rand a supply of books and music that a depressed person would supposedly be into (sadly, since the list includes a number of my favorites, I have apparently been deeply depressed for the past quarter century) and Tim's flippant and overly dramatic reactions to the news of his best friend's death.  Even Rand's death is far from a neat and efficient job.  Not unexpectedly, tension soon begins to grow between Chris and Tim, while Chris' feelings of guilt take a toll on his relationship with his super-hot girlfriend Emma (Keri Russell).  By this point, it's pretty clear where this story is heading - until, that is, everything changes and then changes again.  Some very effective and well-constructed plot twists really take this film to a whole new level, making this a five-star movie in my opinion.

The Curve is one of those rare direct-to-video movies that should have enjoyed a theatrical release.  The plot is tightly constructed and rather ingenious and the acting is quite good all the way around.  The film's only real weakness is the likability of some of the major characters.  I certainly had no trouble liking Emma and poor little Natalie, but the guys are another story.  I had nothing but bad feelings toward Rand, and you really can't feel sorry for Chris at any point because the man did help kill his roommate.  Tim, of course, is highly obnoxious and hard to take in large doses, but the unpredictable nature of his actions makes him a fascinating character to observe.  Truly, though, the story is the real star of this show, and that is why The Curve is such a great movie.",1326499200,,3192,4.713513513513513
1016891,5,6305375577,"With today's fast evolution of the video market, DVDs are becoming so cheap, destocking, competition from Blue-ray, and all kinds of pirating, that we can get DVDs for less than five euros, if not less that five dollars, if not even less than just plain nothing. So when I got into that one, I thought I was entering some kind of college comedy for teeny boppers looking for some soft sexual kicks. But that impression  vanished within fifteen minutes and was replaced by the new question whether this film was one more psycho serial killer, and that did not last even a second quarter of an hour and we moved into an absolutely fascinating variation on the eternal crime story in which we cannot know who is killing who and who is going to be killed next and who is the real serial killer and who is the real designated final victim and how that absolutely foolish but so intricate conspiration is going to be sold to the police, the FBI and all kinds of authorities  as a legitimate suicide or natural death. And it became quite enjoyable after a while and even a little bit more with the elapsing minutes and dozens of minutes to a final punch-line I will not reveal because it is too funny and it proves that anyone can lead anyone else into believing anything they want because the others want to believe anything they are told provided it is slightly bleak, slightly sad and slightly reassuring in its disquieting nature. Enjoy that piece of foolery.

1016892,5,6305375577,"Sadly, probably one of the only. What defines a film noir is where the main character essentially digs their own grave and the twists are unpredictable. I grew up on many of the old film noirs and had never even heard of this movie. Even though I'm currently only in my early-mid 20s right now (2008), I felt a little weird with how some of the references dated the movie. However, Matthew Lillard's performance made me laugh uncontrollably in some parts. Where is he now anyway? Back to the movie - I thought it was wonderful. I suggest, if you like film noirs, check it out. If your movie diet only consists of movies that have been made in the last 10 years, you should probably pass because you may not appreciate it.",1214524800,,721,4.428571428571429
1016952,2,6305375577,"As my title might suggest, I rented THE CURVE because its plot was similar to DEAD MAN ON CAMPUS, a film I enjoyed much more than most of the population, so seeing the same material handled in a much more dark, serious way seemed intriguing. Well, after having viewed THE CURVE, I can say one thing: the title is quite appropriate, as the plot has more twists and turns than a crazy straw.
 Meet Tim (Matthew Lillard, in SCREAM mode) and Chris (Michael 'OMG, he was on ALIAS' Vartan), two roommates who aren't very close but trust each other enough to decide to kill their third roommate Rand (Randall Batinkoff) and make it look like a suicide, thus getting 4.0s (both want into Harvard and have done poorly the current semester). The deed is done, and everything seems okay. Then Rand's body cannot be found, the two are questioned by police, and Rand's apparently pregnant girlfriend Natalie (Tamara Craig Thomas) kills herself out of grief. From there we encounter a series of convoluted double crosses and overacting (mostly through Mr. Lillard), all ending up like a TALES FROM THE CRYPT episode written by Kevin Williamson (you know, the guy who wrote SCREAM 1 & 2 and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER).
 So yes, the film is quite clever at times and had me guessing throughout (though I occasionally guessed what was about to happen), but all of the characters are either bland or just plain unlikable. It's hard to make two guys who want to kill someone for good grades likable (though DEAD MAN ON CAMPUS succeeded), and therein lies the rub: if they're likable, why would they be so heartless as to want to kill someone? And if they're so cruel and unlikable, why should we want to watch a movie about them (especially one where they're supposed to get away with it)? DEAD MAN ON CAMPUS worked more for me because I at least laughed and cared about the people I was watching. I can only pray for a film with this material that has characters you can actually care about and believe that they might be driven to such extremities (though this idea may need to be buried... no pun intended).",1200182400,,2097,4.574468085106383
1016953,4,6305375577,"When I first started watching this movie (I'm over 70) I thought ""oh,just another kid's movie. I don't need this"". Well, fortunately I didn't switch the dial and continued to watch. Further and further I was drawn into this, could be real, senerio.

What a mystery, twists and turns...not to mention the great acting. This is a lost leader. Pick up a copy and enjoy the suspense and good acting!",1167609600,6,395,4.642857142857143
1016954,4,6305375577,"At the beginning of this 1998 film we hear a comedian explaining how colleges have a policy that if your roommate commits suicide, you get a 4.0 for the semester. This is a relatively simple idea, even if it is a complete fabrication, but it has nothing to do with a ""curve"" in the academic sense. I always curve my exams, which means that I take the highest score, compute the difference between the raw score and 100%, and add those points to the exams of everybody who took the exam. That means I can write hard exams and the curve will establish the relative position of everybody in the class to each other. If there is a bad question, then the curve takes it out (although students always want me to give them a point for the bad question even though that then reduces the curve accordingly). A curve is great. But this movie has nothing to do with such a curve. The policy of granting students a 4.0 because their roommate commits suicide has nothing to do with a curve. In fact, although I am not absolutely sure, I do not think the word ""curve"" is uttered by anybody in this movie.

However, ""The Curve"" is going to make you think of the academic environment, right after you think about a breaking pitch to complement a fast ball for a baseball pitcher, so at least it is leaning in the right direction as a movie title. But then I discovered that when it was released this movie was called ""Dead Man's Curve."" Now, that was writer-director Dan Rosen's name for the aforementioned policy, which sort of makes sense, but of course the problem with ""Dead Man's Curve"" as a title is that a lot of people will be thinking about the old Jan & Dean song of the same title (altogether now: ""Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve""), and instead of academia they will be entertaining ideas of a drag race between a Stingray and a shiny new Jag late one night in L.A. Anyhow, the good news is that despite the inadequacy of both of its titles, the movie formerly known as ""Dead Man's Curve"" is a rather entertaining exploration of the twisted logic of college students.

Tim (Matthew Lillard) and Chris (Michael Vartan) are offered the 4.0 after the apparent suicide of their roommate Rand (Randall Batinkoff). The suicide is ""apparent"" because Rand's body has presumably been washed out to sea after a fatal fall from a cliff, and it is not really a ""suicide"" since Tim and Chris helped Rand along. But, hey, grades are important, especially if you want to get into a post-graduate program at Harvard, where one ""B"" can seal your fate. Complicating the chances of Tim and Chris getting away with murder are Rand's girlfriend Natalie (Tamara Craig Thomas), who does not believe he was suicidal, a pair of detectives (Anthony Griffith and Bo Dietl), who never run out of questions, and the campus shrink Dr. Ashley (Dana Delany), who looks like she must be smart enough to figure out that something else is going on. More importantly, Tim keeps suggesting to the police that Chris knows more than he is saying about what happened to Rand, and Emma (Keri Russell), Chris's girlfriend, cannot believe he would actually take the guaranteed 4.0 just because they are offering it to him.

This is one of those films where the story starts twisting and just keeps twisting until most viewers will give up trying to figure out what is really going on. I had fun because while I knew not to take everything at face value (a cardinal rule in such films but even more so when the corpse has gone missing) I just went along for the ride and did not bother trying to catch up with the story let alone waste brain cells trying to get ahead. Besides, you recognize most of the main cast members, and what I liked about the ending was not so much as who won but rather who lost, which appeases by primitive sense of justice. ""The Curve"" is a roller coaster thriller with no other real aspiration beyond keeping you guessing until the end, and in that regard it delivers enough to make it an above average entry in a genre bloated with the corpses of so many less than stellar direct to video offerings.",1122508800,,4086,4.511470985155196
1016955,3,6305375577,"Put all of the ""this plot has been done before"" thoughts aside, and this is a pretty decent movie.  Actually, I thought it was more surprising and more believable that some of the other teen/colleage age horror/murder films.  It had me wondering right up until the end if my assumption of what was really going on was right.  I think it is definitely worth checking out.",1107475200,8,370,4.575757575757576
1016956,5,6305375577,"Without rehasing the plot which can be found in the other good reviews, THE CURVE is a disturbing film and mainly because the bad guys seem to have no moral foundation at all.  Matthew Lillard in a devilishly demonic performance, finds it easy to just roll Randall Batinkoff off the cliff.  As the movie progresses, his deliciously psychotic character does everything he can to be obnoxious, manipulative and heartless.  Rarely has a character seemed so heartless and malicious as his buddy, Randall Batinkoff.  He treats his girlfriend so badly you want him to be dead.  Keri Russell becomes a chameleon, one never knows what to expect from this girl.  And Michael Vartan as the focal ""hero,"" Chris, seems to be innocently oblivious to the deadly mechanisms Lillard is orchestrating.  Add Dana Delany as a psychiatrist trapped by her knowledge of how these vicious minds are working and you have a cast of unusually non-empathic characters.

What makes it work though are the several unexpected twists that come in the movie.  Subtle hints are given throughout the film, but they still pack a wallop at the end.

THE CURVE is a sophisticated and tidy little thriller that should have received a little more notice, but it is a Hitchcockian tribute well done.",1092528000,12,1259,4.924170616113744
1016957,4,6305375577,"The Curve (Dan Rosen, 1998)
It is the painful reality of the American moviegoer that in any year more than one film is released on the same subject, the better film will never fail to either be completely eclipsed, publicity-wise, by the worse film (the good, but nothing great, The Lost Boys overshadowing one of the best modern American films, Near Dark), or the better film will simply not be widely released. Such was the case in 1998 with the horrifically bad Dead Man on Campus and its clever companion The Curve. The latter debuted at the Sundance Film Festival eight months before the release of the former, then disappeared until a video release almost eighteen months later. More's the pity for those who subjected themselves to the MTV-Films-produced monstrosity that was Dead Man on Campus.
Both films center around the same idea-the urban legend that if a collegiate's roommate commits suicide, that collegiate will be granted a 4.0 grade point average for the semester. (Both were, in fact, inspired by the same event-a monologue on a standup comedy show on MTV, which is presented in voiceover at the beginning of The Curve.) Dead Man on Campus played the idea for laughs. The Curve, on the other hand, took the idea and turned it into one of the most intriguing pieces to come out of the new film noir movement.
The film centers around five college seniors. Rand (Randall Batinkoff, of Christy fame), Tim (Matthew ""Shaggy"" Lillard), and Chris (Michael Vartan, most recently seen in One Hour Photo) are roommates; Rand and Chris are also dating roommates Natalie (Tamara Craig Thomas of Odyssey 5) and Emma (Keri Russell, back when she still had great hair). Chris and Tim's grades have both dropped over the semester, and Tim suggests the inevitable: the two of them conspire to kill Rand, whom no one's fond of anyway, and make it look like a suicide. The plot twists, turns, and hairpins from there, becoming that rarest of film birds, an impossibly complex maze that remains easy to follow until the last few minutes (and a few moments of reflection after the movie is over will put everything into place that happens during the climax and denoument).
Many of the reviews I could drum up about the obscure little gem focused on the performance of Matthew Lillard as the borderline psychotic Tim, but to me it was Vartan who truly stood out in this high-powered cast (which also includes such B-level stalwarts as Dana Delany and Henry Strozier). Rare is the role that requires an actor to play the kind of apathetic confusion one often finds in bad slasher films; here we get a chance to see that done right, it's actually workable. Chris, likeably confused throughout, is the perfect foil to Lillard's manic Tim, and the two create an atmosphere of friendship concealing a barely suppressed violence towards one another that gives the film an electricity it needed to stay on track throughout.
Obscure, but well worth tracking down for folks who like their mystery with more twists and turns than a Jane Russell Playtex ad. ****",1042416000,5,3048,4.829827915869981

The plot which begins with a manipulated suicide twists and turns with Hitchcockian flashbacks told in different points of view until the viewer is not quite sure what has happened until the ending---some rewinding may be necessary here to catch some of the nuanced and crucial dialogue.  None of the characters in this film are likeable accept perhaps for Chris (Vartan).  As he takes his grades so seriously that the stress renders him impotent, the audience at least sympathizes with him on some level albeit not a moral one.  The other male characters, Tim and Rand, are so disgustingly unethical and devoid of any inner spiritualism one has to wonder how the actors maintained that empty black hole look that mirrored so effectively the conditions of their characters' souls.  Keri Russell of 'Felicity' fame manages to shrug off her good girl persona with an equally ambitious attempt at a portrayal of an essentially soul-less character, although she doesn't quite succeed in being as believable as the two lead males. The most fascinating aspect of the film was the idea that such abject lying and cheating could be employed to move obstacles obstructing the heart's present desire without the physical blinking of an eye or any other sign of psychological reomorse.  Makes you wonder what kind of people the writers of this film hang out with and if these are the types that actually go to the nation's top schools.  Very scary.",1041724800,4,1723,4.982578397212544
