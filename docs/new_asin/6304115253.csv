790342,5,6304115253,Loved this story of the 3 stooges. Learn a lot of facts that you didn't know.,1252713600,2,77,3.875
790343,5,6304115253,"Always sleuthing for ""missing links"" of Stoogedom, this 2 disc-set brings a smile (and laughs during crystal clear film and audio excerpts).
A true bonanza for Larry Fine afficionados, as Lyla Fine Budnick speaks at length about her Brother, in a most articulate and engaging way.
An insightful, heart-warming life story is the result.
Interviewees such as Larry's Brother-In-Law, and yes, Curly's daughter Janie (!) are sensitived presented. On the original A & E Show, I do not recall them being as strongly identified as on this excellent, expanded reissue.
Speaking of the most popular Stooge, there are fascinating photos of his retirement (or semi-retirement, if you consider two post-1946 cameos), an important element of the story. As much as this package is appreciated, one wonders if more detail could have provided about that second cameo, which has the been a source of mystification and frustration for fans who have been told the results are (1) a lobby card still of Curly in costume for ""Malice In The Palace""; (2) the lobby card still is the only remnant;
(3) there is n actual alternate version available that for some reason local TV stations do not use - Stooge historians.....help!!!
The Gallery feature has plenty of photos which, to this fan, appear to be previously unpublished.",1201046400,10,1303,5.065116279069767
790344,4,6304115253,"This DVD is great in being brief, but descriptive, in the stooges.  It follows the development of their act and all the people that made it happen.  Perfect for the casual fan looking for an inside story of these bozo's.",1173312000,3,220,4.475
790345,4,6304115253,"This is basically an extended version of the A&E Biography on the boys from some time back.  The only difference is that it's now padded out with a lot of great extras.  Though they're essentially the same but for the bonus features, it's kind of confusing how reviews for both 'The Men Behind the Mayhem' and the old VHS of the original documentary are showing up on one another's review pages instead of being separated.

I agree that there are very few clips shown, and the only Columbia shorts shown via clips are 'Disorder in the Court' and 'Sing a Song of Six Pants,' but the title of this documentary is 'The Men Behind the Mayhem,' not 'The Mayhem Behind the Men.'  If one wants something that's little more than a glorified clipshow, there's always the dreadful 'Stop! Look! And Laugh!'  It also seems to work under the premise that the majority of viewers are already quite familiar with the shorts, so they won't need to see endless clips of them paraded out.  However, while I did enjoy this documentary and found it really good, I just wish it had been longer and gone into more depth about some things.  There wasn't a lot of information here that I didn't know already.

The photographs used both during the documentary and included as one of the bonus features (grouped into memorabilia, pix of the boys in character, and rare photos from Lyla Fine Budnick's personal photo album) are a real treasure trove.  I think that most people who move beyond being casual fans into more serious interest in the boys and their careers find it really fascinating, sometimes even touching, how off-camera they were devoted family men and a far cry from their crazy screen characters.  The pictures of Curly (with a full head of hair) and his daughter Janie, from the last few years of his life, were particularly touching.  Janie herself was interviewed, and had nothing but good things to say about her parents' marriage, which was shortlived but very happy, and the father who adored her in the short time he had with her.

Other extras include an appearance Moe, Larry, and Shemp made on 'The Comedy Caravan' (hosted by Ed Wynn) in 1950, the 4 public domain shorts ('Brideless Groom,' 'Disorder in the Court,' 'Sing a Song of Six Pants,' and 'Malice in the Palice'), an interactive DVD-ROM webpage created by Bob Bernet, ""Me and My Pal Moe"" (full of personal letters, photographs, newspaper and magazine obits, and memorabilia), radio interviews, extended interviews with Billy West, Nate Budnick, and Lyla Fine Budnick, and movie trailers.  The television appearance is somewhat amusing, but not really fall-down funny, and it's hampered by the poor print quality.  It's far from unwatchable, but still not crystal-clear.  (It's also shocking how it's sponsored by Camel cigarettes and even contains a skit where Ed is putting up a display of them and then selling them to customers; how far we've come since 1950!).  And speaking of poor print quality, the public domain shorts weren't much better.  'Brideless Groom' in particular had very bad pictorial quality.  I've seen much better prints of them, so it's not like these shabby prints were the only ones to choose from just because they're public domain.  The radio interviews are also great, even though we hear Moe perpetuating the apocryphal legend about Joe DeRita being their first choice to replace Shemp (an urban legend which thankfully is corrected in the documentary itself) and that Shemp left the group in 1932 to play Knobby Walsh in the Joe Palooka series.  Shemp was doing Vitaphone shorts in 1932; the Joe Palooka series wasn't until 1936.  The first half of the final interview is with Larry, about two weeks before he passed away; because of the strokes he'd suffered, his speech is kind of slow and he doesn't sound like his old self, so one has to listen carefully for that one.

All in all, there are a lot of good things on these two discs.  The only reason I can't give it a full 5-star rating is because, as aforementioned, the best possible prints were not used, and as great and informative as it is, I just wish it had gone into some more depth in certain areas instead of reading like a succinct biographical profile of these 6 men and their lives and careers.  The new or casual fan probably won't mind, but people who are more serious fans will want a lot more than just the basics with some elaborations.",1157241600,25,4399,4.742782152230971
790346,3,6304115253,"The Three Stooges shorts are some of the best loved comedy films of all time, and yet many people do not know anything about the men behind the act. They each played a role in keeping the act together for over twenty years and led lives outside of the Stooges.

This biography attempts to shed some light on the subject. It describes how the Stooges were put together by Ted Healy, their decision to leave him, and the reasons for many replacement stooges.

The information found here is easily found in books about the trio, so one would expect something extra special in documentary form. There is nothing really, however. Aside from interviews with good sources like Larry's sister, Ted Healy Jr., and the Stooges fan club president, there is hardly anything to savor. Hardly any clips are used from the many shorts made by the Stooges and what is shown is in bad condition.

This is an acceptable documentary, but it is by no means groundbreaking or highly watchable.",1153526400,8,971,4.7
790347,5,6304115253,"I was impressed with the quality in this DVD presentation.  This documentary succeeds in many ways and preserves for all time some integral interviews of those who knew the Stooges.  Some of the rare photography (including much from the Larry Fine family) was amazing, to say the least, and the DVD is well worth the purchase. It's much better than any previous or current documentaries on the comedy team or Ted Healy. The radio interviews with the Stooges add a nice touch as supplemental materials.",1139184000,16,501,4.882352941176471
790348,5,6304115253,"This DVD set is worth every penny just for the bonus interviews alone - you really get a good look into personal life of Larry Fine with some very interesting stories told by his sister and brother-in-law. Also to have Larry and Moe's last radio interviews included in this set is priceless. Granted, their classic film clips are missing from the documentary, but you can't beat the historical record of the interviews - not to mention the photo libraries containing personal photos of the stooges off screen as well as an archive of movie posters. I'd rather have all this than a documentary of film clips, voiced over with information heard many times over.

And if it's film footage you're after, the bonus disc takes care of that - film trailers, The Ed Wynn Show with Shemp, the 4 public domain shorts.",1120521600,9,807,4.683098591549296
790349,3,6304115253,"The Three Stooges A&E Biography was an interesting documentary, but I wish there were some more clips of Stooge shorts. The one clip from DISORDER IN THE COURT is the only clip in the whole fifty minutes. However, I did learn something from this documentary, such as that Curly made a cameo in MALICE IN THE PALACE, but the scene was cut. I also learned that Shemp poked Larry in the eye in a card game for cheating, and Moe fell out of his seat laughing and added that gag to Stooge shorts.
An interesting documentary, but there's a lack of Stooge clips.",1012176000,8,555,4.398058252427185
790350,5,6304115253,"Who can ever forget these marvelous clowns who kept your eyes glued to the tv laughing at their antics? Their poke in the eyes, slaps on the face and other wild gimmicks were imitated by those children who watched these numbskulls.
  Mo, Larry, Curly,Curly Joe, and Shemp were far more than silly entertainers. They were disciplined comedians whose art transformed the comedy of their time. They were also family men, businessmen and shared all the foibles of all men. Biography does a superb job in chronicling the careers of this group but also allows us to look into their personal lives. You will finc humor, goodwill and sadness in this bunch.

790473,3,6304115253,"If you are a new fan of the Stooges I would recomment this DVD but if you know the history of the comedy team already it is just O.K.  Having said that, I think that a good portion of the DVD could have been devoted to how Moe Howard's heirs cheated the late Larry Fine and Joe DeRita.  I am sure that Moe Howard who was a very honorable man is still turning in his grave over how Comedy 3 residual income was so unfairly distributed.  There was a court case involving this issue.  Ironically, Bella LaGussi Jr. a great attorney sued on behalf of the estate of Joe DeRita and Larry Fine.",1360540800,,587,4.168141592920354
790474,3,6304115253,"Never a fan of The Stooges but a documentary junkie, I gave this a shot. I get the feeling that budget may have been an issue here as the production value just didn't keep me moving along.

Less 1980s hairdo headshots of the Fan Club President, more clips to substantiate the comedic genius and perhaps some contemporary comedians (NOT Adam West!) to chime in would have captured more of my attention.",1339632000,,401,4.647887323943662
790475,5,6304115253,"One of the very few Stooge collections that is actually pretty good.  The documentary feature is quite good along with the additional interviews and other features.

the 3-Stooges, this (1st) DVD is fascinating - yet leaves me wanting More, more information, details etc. Yet I don't want or have
time in my life to study the Stooges. So - I was looking forward to watching the 2nd disc in this set - but -
to me - it's basically a throw-away. Just minor bonus stuff. - It is Not a continuation of this documentary of the 1st DVD.
I have another Stooges DVD 'The Stooges Story'(?) That's a really good one too.
Life is full of mysteries - I sometimes I wonder - what is better - having all the answers - or assuming I want to know them?
