7998171,4,B0000C2ITM,"If you know what I mean. This movie features decent acting (not horrible, mind you. I've seen horrible), fat Italians, angry Hispanics, and very nice looking ladies that work at a strip club, but don't strip, do lapdances, etc. Kenya Moore (Passion) had the best performance out of everybody and did very believable and dramatic cry scenes. She really knows how to cry!
The rest of the movie is filled with a ton of plot holes, though, like how Passion, out of nowhere, just pulls out fake I.D.'s for her friends (Sunshine and Midnight) who refuse to help her find the killer of her brother, but then all of sudden just decide to do it and they all suddenly know how to jack cars. Also, when Passion's brother tried to talk his friend out of jacking cars (who was very into doing that), he easily agreed and went to tell their employers, the Italians (who seem to do nothing but sit and eat), that they quit. There is also a lot more, but it would just take up this whole page. Conclusively, all of the characters in this movie are unbelievable, melodramatic, and they act out of character many times creating a lot of plot holes.
But why 4 stars? The presentation of this movie was so that it didn't feel like a big problem! It didn't feel distracting at all and was easy to just go along with. Also, all the girls looked nice (except for Blueberry or whatever. She was too skinny). The movie was still enjoyable and it was fun to watch how all the characters interact with one another and how they react to different situations.
But beware, though, if you are looking for a movie with a great story and well developed and BELIEVABLE characters. There isn't any. You are really going to have to be an open-minded and easy-going person to enjoy this movie.",1077580800,4,1756,4.490625
7998172,2,B0000C2ITM,"This is a bad movie, really bad.  You know you're in trouble when durring the opening credits you see 2 of the stars of the movie listed as producers (we're not talking Ron Howard & Ton Hanks here)  The story is laughable, the acting is really weak, but then again the writing is bad so I can't blame the actors.
Was this a straight to video release? The production values are NILL!  It really hurts me to say all this, because Kenya Moore is in it. I'm not sure if she's a good actor or not, because I've never seen her in a well written role. But man oh is she beautiful! She is also the executive producer here. The story has a ton of holes in it. At one point Kenya and 2 of her stripper friends (they dance at a strip club but all 3 are againt, and don't actually strip) are talking, she is crying over a tragedy.  She says she wants revenge, pulls out 2 fake ID's, gives them to her friends and asks if they are in.  They pause a second and both agree.  Now mind you there are fake ID's & ""revenge"" involved. AND... Neither asked exactly what she was refering to.  They just agreed like that.
Not to give the movie away, but the 3 strippers who don't actually strip become car thiefs for the town mob boss.  Who, shockinly, is a fat Italian who seems to sit around his warehouse all day eating pasta.
As bad as the movie started, it never got better.  And the final 10 minutes are about THE WORST I remember seeing. The ending takes the cake for beliving so unbeliable.  I didn't see it coming at all, but then again I didn't really care enough to try and figure it out. I am not kidding when I say overall this movie has the calibur of a first film made by a group of high school students.  I will give the movie 1 of the 2 stars because it was totally independant, and they did do a better job then I could.  Which really isn't saying much...  And I'll give it the other star I did because Kenya is in it, and she is a sight to behold.  Note this is R rated, there is some explicit langauge, but no real violence, and no nudity.  The ""strip club"" scenes. the dancing females have Bikinis on.",1074211200,,2099,4.122850122850123
