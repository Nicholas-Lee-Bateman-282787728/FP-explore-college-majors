3910026,5,B002DC3FFK,"Very clever writing, and very funny.  Everything just comes together in this show.  It's clean and suitable for the whole family.  This show is often said to be the Canadian equivalent of Seinfeld...if so it's just because of how well you get to know and love the characters and how well it's written.  I think you could make an analogy with ""The Office"" - again, well written, clean, and no stupid laugh tracks!",1274745600,,412,4.602739726027397
3910027,5,B002DC3FFK,"""Corner Gas"" is very funny. It's for the whole family. You'll feel you live in Dog River, Saskatchewan, with the wonderful characters on this show that ran for six seasons on Canadian TV and on WGN-Chicago.

3910028,5,B002DC3FFK,We love Corner Gas! A lot of fun word play and character interactions.  Great show!,1265414400,5,83,4.533333333333333
3910029,5,B002DC3FFK,"My favorite show!  I,m from MN and this is just like the town I grew up in.. I know these people and miss them.  Wish it were back on.",1264550400,,134,3.586206896551724
3910030,5,B002DC3FFK,it's the funniest show i have ever seen and it is also one of the cleanest shows on TV. This show is puts american sitcoms to shame.,1264032000,,132,3.925925925925926
3910031,5,B002DC3FFK,fantastic series.  This was a christmas gift & we've nearly watched all 6 seasons.,1263686400,,82,4.857142857142857
3910032,5,B002DC3FFK,"My husband and I love the show Corner Gas which used to air on WGN out of Chicago.  Sadly, it stopped airing but I was able to find all six seasons on Amazon.  It is a funny and quirky show very similar to the old Northern Exposure.",1259539200,,232,3.9148936170212765
3910033,5,B002DC3FFK,"Here is a really refreshing sitcom--it's witty, it's clever, and it's a lot of fun.  Think of Andy Griffith or Northern Exposure with a Canadian twist and you have it. Brent Leroy (Brent Butt, the show's main writer) deals with a troop of wacky, quirky characters that make up the small Saskatchewan town of Dog River.  The interactions amongst the characters are excellent and I like the fact Brent is droll without being cruel and crass, as happens so often in American sitcoms.  It's too bad more TV isn't like this and I am truly sorry the series ends with season 6.",1258675200,16,570,4.568627450980392
3910034,5,B002DC3FFK,Love the dry Canadian humor.  Much of the show is laugh out loud funny.  We are working our way through the seasons as there are a lot of episodes in this package.  It is great to have all six seasons available when we want them.,1411516800,,229,4.044444444444444
3910035,5,B002DC3FFK,Several years ago a friend loaned it to me . saying i'd love it..... she was right.  couldn't afford the whole series then.  now I can.  I lo ve it.  No complaints.,1395014400,,164,4.03125
3910036,5,B002DC3FFK,Annual viewing is required to keep my (and my wife's) sense of humor well tuned.  Incredible cast and writing.  Not enough TV of this caliber anymore!!!!,1393027200,,153,4.846153846153846
3910037,5,B002DC3FFK,"The best, we watch these every almost every lunch time and have since we received them about six years ago.. can not believe we are still laughing at them.. in fact we had to order a second set because of obvious reasons...",1385683200,,223,4.333333333333333
3910038,5,B002DC3FFK,We have enjoyed watching this over the winter.  Too bad TV today is so bad there are not many programs worth watching.  Corner Gas is just a means to laugh and enjoy a simple life.,1380672000,,180,4.114285714285714
3910039,1,B002DC3FFK,ALl of the DVD's were faulty and we could not watch an entire DVD and most episodes without the DVD failing.,1358553600,,108,4.190476190476191
3910040,5,B002DC3FFK,"I was reluctant to watch this series of videos and really only did it because Netflix thought I would enjoy them.
I gave them a try and found them to be so entertaining that I bought the whole set.
It's the story of some people who live in a small town in Canada.  Usually centered around the local Gas station and Diner.
The humor is very clean but I don't think children would get it so even though it's pretty much PG-13 I wouldn't really call it a family show.
Sounded boring to me but it turned out to be hilarious.
Everybody that we have shared it with also found it to be very funny.",1356739200,,590,4.130434782608695
3910041,5,B002DC3FFK,"Corner Gas has to be the best ""unknown"" tv series that I've ever seen. A perfect cast of actors portrays a perfect cast of characters in this well-written comedy series. Who cares if it takes place in the middle of nowhere, Saskatchewan? If you can't enjoy this series, your sense of humor has been dulled by the general crap on television.",1326499200,,340,4.590163934426229
3910042,5,B002DC3FFK,"Have you laughed at a TV sit-com because it was funny, without an invasive laugh track? Well, Corner Gas is the one (and possibly only) series where you will not hear laughter when a cast member merely enters a scene. The Canadian cast members are exquisite in their roles and are recipients of Canada's top acting awards. Every episode is unique and you'll be hard pressed to quess the plot, unlike Anerican TV where all is telegraphed to you in the first two minutes. I've often said this series is reminiscent of the Laurel & Hardy comedies, where after countless viewings you'll still laugh your butt off. It's a must-have for any DVD collection. Buy it, you won't regret it!!!",1324166400,,681,4.683333333333334
3910043,2,B002DC3FFK,"As much as I liked this Canadian Sitcom show, the quality control of these disks is atrocious. Out of 17 disks, 2 were bad. That's a 12% failure rate. Because of that reason, I would not recommend ordering these.

I did get replacement disks. The company I bought them from (Best TV Sellers)was very good at replacing them. I would highly recommend buying DVDs from them. (Just not Corner Gas).",1320451200,,394,4.628571428571429
3910044,5,B002DC3FFK,"I recieved my dvds before the estimated date,and the package was in great condition.
I am happy that I was able to find and purchase the dvds.
Thank you.",1303430400,2,153,4.310344827586207
3910045,5,B002DC3FFK,Great Product and shipping. We absolutely love the corner gas series and now we will have it for years to come. Thanks so much for the Fantastic service and and the wonderful product. We just love to use Amazon whenever we can. We will be back...,1303257600,3,246,4.369565217391305
3910046,5,B002DC3FFK,"We started watching Corner Gas on a trip to Saskatoon, SK, Canada and couldn't stop laughing!  When we got home we ordered it and have watched all six seasons several times.  This is WELL worth the price!",1301443200,3,204,4.486486486486487
3910047,5,B002DC3FFK,"Corner Gas is a subtle, humorous Canadian take on that TV staple - the sitcom. It's immensely entertaining if you pay attention to the quirky humor and word play. If you want mindless moron time wasting - then stick to reality television this stuff will sail right over your head.",1300320000,4,280,4.62
3910048,5,B002DC3FFK,"Living in Sydney, Australia as a transplanted Canuck, I do not get ample opportunity to see TV from my homeland, Toronto, Canada. I had seen a few episodes of Corner Gas on TV here (SBS) and loved it. After some research I ordered the entire TV series on DVD.
It is great viewing!.  The plots are original and fast moving, the characters endearing. I love the way Brent Butt (love that name!) has made it a very Canadian series; you always see our beautiful flag in the background; a big CP railcar on the tracks. The humour is clever, witty, fast paced and very Canadian. I was impressed how even the PM of Canada, Steven Harper had a cameo role on CG! Even my Aussie partner and our kids love it.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CORNER-GAS-Season-1-2-3-4-5-6/dp/B002DC3FFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CORNER GAS Season 1 2 3 4 5 6</a>

3910049,5,B002DC3FFK,"The best TV show in years.  I'm sad that it's gone but having the series on disk at home means that it is never really gone for me and my friends who watch it in my appartment with me.  Clever humor, something a displaced mid-westerner can identify with.",1294963200,2,254,4.270833333333333
3910050,5,B002DC3FFK,This is probably one of the best shows I have ever seen. Canada hit it on the head with this show and I don't think my father and I will ever get tired of this. If you want to laugh until you cry this is the show for you.,1294876800,5,221,3.5306122448979593
3910051,5,B002DC3FFK,"I recieved the DVDs in just a few days.  I have seen all of them, over 100 episodes and over 40 hours, they were great, no flaws what so ever.  Great videos, great company. Looking to buy some more from this company.",1282694400,,216,4.119047619047619
3910052,5,B002DC3FFK,"Corner Gas is absolutely fabolous! It used to be a late night treat on a TV station that came out of Chicago, but one day they just stopped showing it. I'm glad I was able to find all of the seasons, brand new, on Amazon. This is a great show for anyone who enjoys comedies! Additionally, it is great because each episode is independent of one another show you can pop in any disk and enjoy! The only downside is that I'm not familiar with some of the Canadian references, but that is not essential to enjoying the show.",1281225600,,520,4.262626262626263
3910053,5,B002DC3FFK,A Canadian sitcom that is at least equal to Northern Exposure.  Cast driven plots along with unusual comedic twists. Intelligently written.,1279929600,,139,5.619047619047619
8364993,4,B002DC3FFK,"No need to review the content, but I take off one star because of the sound problems.  In many quieter scenes you can hear music of some sort playing in the background, like there was a radio left on near the sound stage.  If you are old enough to remember recording on VHS tapes or audio cassettes, these DVDs sound like the deteriorated quality you get from multiple overlays of recordings.  Too bad for one of the best TV series ever.  Why can't more shows be this witty and fun, never vulgar or loud or PC.  Would love to live in Dog River, if such a place could exist.",1485734400,,573,4.220183486238532

8364998,5,B002DC3FFK,"LOVE IT!  Love this show and can only complain that they didn't do enough seasons of it!  It's my favorite ""comfort T.V."".  Physical condition of the DVDs excellent too - I haven't experienced any skips and the picture quality seems fine, although I have an older T.V and I'm not aiming for a theater-type experience.",1439683200,,317,4.7272727272727275

8365002,4,B002DC3FFK,This show is absolutely awesome.  I highly recommend if you like dry humor that is not R rated.  It is very different than any other show on TV today.  The only problem is that I received one set as a gift and I sent one set as a gift and both contained a damaged CD (the same one on both).  This was disappointing.,1412553600,2,315,3.9523809523809526
