8048132,4,B0007LFPWK,"The Guitar Styles of Wes Montgomery by Adrian Ingram is good. Plenty for me to learn there, as someone who is essentially a beginner or low-intermediate in terms of Jazz guitar. As an example on ""Impressions"", one of my favorite Wes performances, Adrian explains the relationships between the scales and chords used, and where they fit. It does give alot of insight into Wes' approach on that song... I like that there are actual performances of Wes Montgomery included within the video.

I would have preferred much more detail in regards to a study of Wes' solo on Impressions (as an example), but having gone through the video lesson I am much more advanced in my understanding of the material than I was before

And then there is the advantage of being able to go back and check it out again and again. It is a DVD well worth owning",1257984000,4,836,4.566666666666666
