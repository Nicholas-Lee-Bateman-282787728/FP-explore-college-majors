Along the lines of Reservoir Dogs, there is a team of 5 (Gonin translates to ""5 People"") who steal a grip of money from a yakuza office at gunpoint.  Although they get away, the yakuza find out who did it and hire a hitman to try and kill them all, Beat Takeshi.
Beat Takeshi is one of my favorites and have seen most of his movies after the Beats, never seen a Beat yet.  He is kind of like Japan's DeNero, and he made this film work.  My favorite line out of the movie is where Beat shots a few rounds from his .38 missing his target, and hitting some other people, chases the mark and fires his 6th round again missing, hands the gun to his partner and says ""Dame da, kono teppo"" (this gun is useless) as if it couldn't be his aim (the subtitle says ""It's useless"" losing the meaning to think they are just giving up chasing him).  Another classic Takeshi scene is where he goes out into the pouring rain to shoot 2 of the 5 wearing just some house slippers and holding an umbrela too small to cover himself.  TRIVIA:  The patch on Takeshi's eye is real, recieved during an accident causing permanant damage.
There are times when this movie dips a little heavy into the artistry aspect of movie making, and only a few times, so it seems like the director made some mistakes, but he was just trying to cause a certain mood, which he does effectively.  This is a very violent movie, and quite disturbing for even hardened action movie watchers, but if you are in the market for a good story and better fimography, this is one to keep.",1015977600,7,1589,4.276666666666666
8221502,4,B000059PQA,"When I first saw this movie on TV - and the movie seemed to be heavily cut - I only thougth that Takashi Ishii is really a director with talent and the ability to create something special and unique.
The fighting scences looked sometimes very improvised, but were in fact strongly choreographed and filmed in a stylish way that gave you an intense feeling while watching them.
But there were also scences where I unfortunately didn't get the point. For example: The ex-cop is sitting in a restaurant, his wife and daughter are at the restroom, so he is waiting. Then a cut and suddenly everybody in the restaurant has disappeard - no guests can be seen anymore, no waiters and so on. The wife and the daughter come back and the action begins... and where is the rest? That was definitely a directional flaw.
2. When the man with the glasses comes home he sees his daughter - all fine. He goes in the room of his son, but he can't even see, that his son is lying dead in the bed. His wife has obviously left him, so he is phoning a prostitute and 2 secs later the action begins again. Exscuse me, but that's terribly directed.
3. The two desperates are attacked by the two hitmen, escaping in a restroom, waiting there behind a door made of wood. The hitmen fire through the door, they scream and seconds later, the hitmen are away. That's sheer nonsense in my opinion...
The characters seem to be underdeveloped. What's up with their background story? Nothing can be found... Especially the gigolo. I still don't know what's up with that person.
First and last an interesting movie with some flaws but a great atmosphere, never before seen acts of violence and a very bizarre
ending.",1006387200,3,1683,4.5394736842105265

8221504,3,B000059PQA,"I viewed the Japanese print of this DVD.  It is a good film of it's type (Japan's long-running Yakuza genre; analogous to the US Gangster/Mafia genre).  It is stylishly filmed and well executed (no pun intended), but it is an awfully brutal movie.  The film is devoid of any sense of hope for the protagonists. The story concerns 5 down-and-out guys, victims of the collaps of Japan's ""bubble"" economy of the early 1990's (this bit of character motivation is not explained particularly well, but I guess if you were from Japan, you'd know all about it anyway), who decide to rob the local Yakuza.  They manage to pull off the job, but the Yakuza send two hitmen after them.  They manage to find all 5 men and kill them AND the people close to them.  There really is no question about whether the men will be caught, but rather when and how many times they will be shot. The interesting thing about this movie is the inclusion of homosexual overtones to such a testosterone-fueled picture (one of the 5 thieves is a cross-dresser and the two hitmen are gay).  However, the idea never really plays into the film (except to add one more disturbing scene to an already unsettling film) and ends up looking like it was included only to make the audience even more uneasy. The movie looks good, if a bit too dark (most of the movie takes place at night), but is filled with the flashing neon lights, inky blue-black hues and heavy rains of a noire film.  Surprisingly, the camera work is realatively mundane for this sort of film. All in all, a good movie for people interested in the Japanese Yakuza genre, but it's graphic violence, relentless brutality and cruelty may be off-putting to some viewers.",984182400,5,1697,4.614617940199335
