8538446,5,B009AIE662,"Giles Quispel was intrinsic to getting the Jung Codex into Jung's possession. This DVD is a beautiful record (by Quispel and an interviewer) of Quispel's memories of Jung. Very worthy of purchase. Also, the package came with a very thick, lovely bookmark. I would heartily recommend the Quispel DVD of Remembering Jung.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Keep-This-Quiet-My-Relationship-with-Hunter-S-Thompson-Milton-Klonsky-and-Jan-Mensaert/dp/0983704503/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Keep This Quiet!

8538447,5,B009AIE662,"Van Der Post is a most excellent communicator. I learned things about Jung that were not in Van Der Post's biography of Jung, and while the interviewing format was a bit academic, the inserted documentary photos and what not make it very easy to watch. Well worth any serious student of the inner life.",1361664000,2,302,4.611111111111111
