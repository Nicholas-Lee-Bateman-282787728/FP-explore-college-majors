1921826,1,B0000DBJDN,"I don't even have words to describe how truly BAD this movie is! It wanders aimlessly, has no discernable plot, was directed by a 13-year-old, edited by his 11-year-old kid brother and makes absolutely no sense- on ANY level! I love old movies, new movies, classic movies and contemporary movies. I love chick flicks and war movies. I love romantic comedies and sci-fi. From Fred Astaire to Adam Sandler, from Kathryn Hepburn to Madonna- I LOVE great films. My wife and I agreed after STRUGGLING through 45-minutes of this nightmare: THROW IT AWAY!!",1129161600,7,549,4.913978494623656
1921827,5,B0000DBJDN,"I must agree with another reviewer that the title does not fit the movie as I thought it would be about cowboys as well before I seen it. The movie was also located at the western section? That's just so wrong. The movie is absolutely beautiful. People have been asking about a soundtrack. Just for your info there has not been a soundtrack available but you can purchase the album ""Myths Of Red"" by Sasha Lazard who sings the main theme ""Angeli"". You'll love the whole album if you love the theme. Just a coincedence I had the album for a few years now and just got the movie a few weeks ago. I've been listening to that song almost everynight now.",1110326400,4,649,4.327868852459017
1921828,4,B0000DBJDN,"Danny is a man who has 'done-been-wronged' and he is quickly loosing faith in love as he watches it fall farther and farther from his ideal in the relationships of the people around him. In steps a living angel who helps Danny to see love through different eyes, feel hope again, return him to his his ideals, and ultimately a real love relationship.

This movie is more than just an ordinary box office romance.  Gregory Haynes gives us a sensitive pictoral expression of deeper spiritual love. This love is not limited to our earthly plane; it does not see with the eyes, hear with the ears, or speak from the mouth. It effects and transforms our lives on the higher planes of the knowing heart and soul. With dialogue such as ""Sometimes it's not the things that you can see or touch that are real, sometimes it's what you feel in your heart that's most tangible."" and ""Ancient philosophers believe that there was a language that was spoken by angels and it couldn't be translated or repeated because it was only understood by the soul."", Gregory Haynes reminds us that our world is not as random as we might suppose. Life is perhaps ordered and aided by a power greater and more magnificent than our selves if we are only willing to release our fears and surrender our hearts and soul to Love.

All of the actors do a lovely job expressing this story. I particularly liked the scene where Danny's sister, Dana, admits her loss of hope and Danny embraces her with unconditional love even though he does not agree with her choices. This is followed by a very beautiful series of ""old home movie"" images of Danny and Dana as children. Your heart wrenches with Danny's as you 'remember' Dana as an innocent, open, loving little girl knowing that as an adult she has chosen a hard path in love. Where, when, and how did she lose that purity of love of childhood? Where and when did we each lose it?

The comic relief character is wonderful as well.",1105488000,21,1946,4.535612535612535
1921829,5,B0000DBJDN,Despite watching this film so many times it is so fabulous even now. If you love meaningful love stories then this is the film for you. It is pretty much unheard of in the UK so I was overjoyed when I found out it was available on DVD from the US as I have been relying on re-runs on the movie channel!!,1095465600,5,303,3.903225806451613
1921830,5,B0000DBJDN,"But, judging by it's sales rank none of you have seen it yet. It's as good as Pretty Woman. It has lots of weddings, it has fantastic scenery with spectacular sunsets and sunrises. The storyline IS moving and uplifting as it claims on the back. Even the acting is faultless.
So, women of America start buying this film - trust me you won't regret it! And then start spreading the word.",1082505600,2,385,4.436619718309859

1921832,5,B0000DBJDN,"THIS FILM ISN'T A WESTERN, ALTHOUGH THE TITLE MIGHT LEAD YOU TO THINK SO.
IT IS QUITE COMMENDABLE TO SEE SUCH A PROFANITY-FREE MOVIE FOR A CHANGE.
FOR EXAMPLE: SO MANY LOVE STORIES ARE DESTROYED BY MEANINGLESS PROFANE LANGUAGE AND SEX SCENES!!
THIS MOVIE STANDS OUT AS A TOUCHING AND MOVING FILM EXPERIENCE AND I'D BE WILLING TO SAY THAT YOU'LL FEEL THE LOVE WHEN YOU SEE IT!!
IF YOU'RE A SENTIMENTALIST LIKE ME, THEN THIS LITTLE GEM IS SURE TO MAKE YOU SMILE AND LEAVE YOU THINKING!
LOVE IS SUCH AN AMAZING THING AND THIS FILM PORTRAYS LOVE AND THE POWER OF LOVE ON PEOPLE QUITE ACCURATELY.
THIS IS A MOVIE THAT LEAVES YOU WITH A SMILE
AND MAKES YOU NEVER WANT TO SEE THE FINAL CREDITS ARRIVE!!
MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT'S AN ACCURATE AND TRUTHFUL LOVE STORY THAT YOU AND YOURS SHOULD ENJOY FOR YEARS TO COME!!
NOT TO MENTION THE FANTASTIC ACTING BY THE LEADS IN THE FILM.
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY ASK FOR MUCH BETTER THAN THIS!! ENJOY!!!

1921849,4,B0000DBJDN,"After running across this movie on Amazon, being the cowboy lover I am, I just had to have it. The acting was good, and the overall movie was good. The underline message was good as well but I felt it was a little too subtle. A little disjoined, a little confusing. It felt like there was something missing to the connection of the Angel,the cowboy and the other woman.

In the end, they kind of threw you for a loop, not leaving you with an ""ah, ha"" moment, but rather with confusion. I mean I got it but it was rather blunt, not carried out very well. I felt they should have played it out a little better to get across the point they'd been trying to convey that hadn't been clear up until that point. At any rate it was a good movie, just not great due to the way it was played out in the end.",1292976000,,797,4.044303797468355

1921851,5,B0000DBJDN,"I really liked this movie. I had to watch it 3 times to make sure who was who and why they performed the way they did. Other reviewers either really liked this movie or they hated it. No -- it's really not about Cowboys---but since Cowboys are people --- it is about relationships. The music is different which I think adds to the movie and you have to think about what is happening in the movie. The director doesn't spoon feed it to you like in ""Sleepless in Seattle"" which I thought was a great movie. I don't usually buy DVDs ---I use NetFlix ---but I bought this movie.  I also bought Dan in Real Life.  Both from Amazon",1275350400,,625,4.243697478991597

1921860,2,B0000DBJDN,"First of all the title is a misnomer.  One guy who wears a hat and boots does not make a cowboy.  So where are the ""Cowboys""?
This movie was just plain weird. If you are looking for a ""western"" style romance...forget it.  Adam Trese is nice to look at, but there has to be more to a movie than a good lookin' guy who happens to wear a hat and boots.
The charactor evens says in the movie ""I'm not a real cowboy"".  You couldn't drown in this movie if you were a tadpole!",1263600000,2,469,3.9574468085106385

1921862,1,B0000DBJDN,I did not like this movie at all. I would not recommend it to anyone.  Boring!,1250812800,,78,3.875
1921863,3,B0000DBJDN,First I have to say that I love a good romance.  I have a vast movie collection full of romances that I love to watch over and over again.  This movie was okay...but not great.  I probably will not watch it again...and my main reason for purchasing versus renting is to view the movie again and again.  This movie was hard to follow and focused more on the gentleman's scorn from previous relationships than the romance itself.  It was kind of a downer versus an upbeat love story.  And if your not religious and don't believe in real angels....I definitely wouldn't recommend it.  It just didn't have enough happy love scenes to keep me intrigued.,1238716800,3,648,4.582608695652174
1921864,1,B0000DBJDN,If I could have given this movie a minus star I would have.  We never did get the story line.  We kept waiting for something redeeming about it but it never came.  Truly not worth your time or money.,1237766400,3,199,4.051282051282051
1921865,5,B0000DBJDN,Great movie now one of my favorites and reading the other reviews on this one talked me into buying it and I was not disappoint so thanks to all who shared their comments! I movie worth watching and at a great price too!,1227312000,2,220,4.1395348837209305
1921866,5,B0000DBJDN,"My wife and I saw this movie when it debuted at the Sundance

intriguing story.  I would recommend it to anyone.",1227052800,4,238,4.130434782608695
1921867,1,B0000DBJDN,"The cover of the movie and the title give a person the idea that this movie is about the country, old fashioned romance, etc.  FAR FROM IT.  I had to fast forward through parts of it -- it was just so strange, so lacking direction from scene to scene. Completely unbelievable plot. I guess I was expecting something that was more ""normal"" rather than so artsy...even the strange New Age music used in the film sets a bizarre mood.  I guess every person is different and some would find deep, spiritual meaning from this show.  I just consider it a waste of my money.
P.S.  I am surprised this show got a PG rating - themes, etc. are more like PG-13 at least...NOT a family flick).",1216080000,2,680,4.365079365079365
1921868,1,B0000DBJDN,"Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Horrendously bad writing, acting, producing....horrible on every level. COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.",1215216000,3,152,5.954545454545454
1921869,5,B0000DBJDN,"This is a wonderful film, but can be confusing (Starting with the title- the sole thing wrong with this movie is the idiotic title). I have watched it many times and and find more all of the time.  In some ways, this is like a Scandinavian movie: The plot is in fact very dense and close nit- absolutely every part ties together- BUT it is not spelled out for you like some sort of formulaic romantic comedy. Instead, much is suggested and you have to use your imagination to fill in the additional details.  If the details had been spoon fed to you then the movie would have had to be four hours long: This is only acceptable if you are watching War and Peace.

So, I will give you a hint or two: At the beginning of the film Danny is the best man at his sister's wedding. He is heartbroken as he was himself just left at the altar by a woman he was deeply in love with. Danny has high ideals, is in fact a very good man and truly believes in true love, but the result has been hurt and despair.

To God, this situation is NOT a disaster- It is an opportunity. Time to send in an angel or two.......  Oh, and no this is NOt about how things are somehow specially arranged so as to keep Danny from becoming jaded. In fact he is in for some additional pain (literally) and heartache. One of the things Danny gets to learn is that he is NOT the center of the universe. But it turns out that this will also be okay.

This film goes far deeper into exploring the ideas and nature of love than 99 percent of the love stories out there.  And the three main actors [Radha Mitchell [who is fast becoming one of my favorites], Adam Trese and Mia Kirschner) were all absolutely perfect in their roles.

I do not want to spoil your enjoyment or appreciation for this little gem.  Rather, I want to suggest that you allow your imagination to work and help you enjoy the full story.  If you do not participate in the story with your imagination then you will simply end up bewildered (as a least one of the reviewers on this site did- what a pity).",1209686400,6,2035,4.194871794871795
1921870,2,B0000DBJDN,"There is poor character development, bad acting and same cliche ideas. The main guy falls in love with one woman, then with another, while at the same time still pining after his ex fiance who dumped him at the altar. The 2nd woman he falls in love with has the same cliche mentality about romance and relationships (there is only 1 person in the world for everyone), but somehow the writters thought the audience will buy into that highschool mentality. I wasn't convinced with Danny being truely in love with Candice because he was just to eager to leave her for JoJo then suddenly he had a revelation that he is in love with Candice and not JoJo. Sounds like the man needs to be alone for a while to sort out his personal issues instead of throwing himself into relationships.",1209686400,4,779,4.531914893617022

1921879,5,B0000DBJDN,"'Cowboys and Angels' is a sweet, tender love story about one man's search for the girl of his dreams. Danny (Adam Trese) has been left standing at the altar and begins to doubt if true love really exists. Unexpectedly two attractive women soon come into his life (Mia Kirshner and Radha Mitchell) and before long he must decide which woman is the one fated to become his wife. What he doesn't realize is that angelic forces are present and subtlely guiding him to make the right decision.

I love this movie! Mia Kirshner is absolutely gorgeous as Candice, she is fast becoming one of my favorite actresses. This is a film that can be enjoyed by everyone, old and young, so watch it with your entire family.

Warning to Cowboy Movie Fans: If you're thinking of renting or buying this movie based solely on the presence of the word ""cowboy"" in the title, don't. It really has nothing whatsoever to do with being a cowboy. One of Danny's love interests happens to live and work on a ranch and you see a couple people ocassionally wearing cowboy hats, but that is the extent of it.",1136332800,87,1078,4.523076923076923
