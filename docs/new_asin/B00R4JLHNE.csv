6898951,5,B00R4JLHNE,"Many kids yoga DVD's are either a bit too serious or a bit too silly  this one is a perfect balance. My kids love popping in this yoga DVD (by themselves!). They especially like the parter yoga series ""Dino Duo"" in which my kids get to hold hands and help each other with yoga postures (really sweet). There are 4 unique yoga practices on this DVD. Do them all together or choose one and call it a day. Jodi's lightheartedness and experience teaching yoga to thousands of kids around the world really shines through in this DVD. I'd recommended it as a 'must have' in any families home collection!",1425945600,7,597,4.477064220183486

8694106,5,B00R4JLHNE,"This was my second time purchasing this DVD. The first time was at a store. This time we bought it for my daughters friend for her birthday. Kids just love this series.
It doesn't use real yoga terms, they do things like the pterodactyl. That doesn't bother me at all, but it might get to hard core yoga fanatics.
My daughter has been doing yoga since she was 3, and now she will just put it in to do it on her own, it is so amazing. I am in love with all of them, and wish they would make some more!",1495670400,,500,3.911764705882353
