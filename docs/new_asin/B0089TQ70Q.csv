5145864,5,B0089TQ70Q,This is truly how I interpret Batman.  I wish that the live action films could be this loyal to the comics and the character.,1389312000,,125,4.208333333333333

5145867,5,B0089TQ70Q,"If you are a fan of Batman this is a must have. I mean c'mon The Dark Knight, you can't beat that.",1373760000,,98,3.5
5145868,5,B0089TQ70Q,"You just can't beat the value for the price of this three movie bundle.  It's worth the purchase for Under the Red Hood and Batman Year One alone but Batman Gotham Knight was a lot better than i had anticipated.  It is a lot like the Animatrix and is a collaboration of a few different animation styles telling different stories of batman.

I don't know if this is the case for every one but i also had a code to redeem all three movies in the Ultraviolet digital format.  This was a big selling point for me as i am trying to beef up my digital collection",1368316800,2,556,4.168224299065421

5145871,4,B0089TQ70Q,"Three Batman animated movies at a decent price, I've seen Year One selling for much more alone.  I would have given this 5 stars if the packaging were done better.",1357430400,3,163,4.433333333333334
5145872,4,B0089TQ70Q,"It says that this won't be released until October 2, but Wal-Mart is selling this, the Batman: Triple Feature, to promote the Dark Knight Rises movie.

The Batman Triple feature has 3 discs with the movies; Batman: Gotham Knight, Batman: Under the Red Hood, and Batman: Year One. The discs are packaged on top of each other and of course, each disc comes with the movie and special features. Batman: Gotham Knight comes with a few trailers such as the first Batman Lego Game and the animated Wonder Woman movie. Batman: Under the Red Hood comes with the Jonah Hex animated short and a few more trailers like The Dark Knight, Superman Apocalypse,  and others. Batman: Year One comes with special features such as the DC showcase of Catwoman and trailers such as Young Justice, All Star Superman, Thundercats, and Justice League Doom (probably might want to check Doom out to because it is a very, very good movie in my opinion even though the villains aren't who you would expect them to be. Very good story).

The Movies:
I thought Batman: Gotham Knight was ok. It featured 6 short films about Batman's transition from novice crime fighter to Dark Knight. The art is anime-like and showed various views of Batman. I give it 3 stars because I liked two out of the six shorts and it also because it had Kevin Conroy (voice of Batman in Batman: the Animated Series and in Justice League and Justice League Unlimited).
Now, I liked Batman: Under the Red Hood. It would have been nice to have Kevin Conroy as Batman's voice but Bruce Greenwood is good also. But I feel like Greenwood didn't do as good as job as he does as Batman in Young Justice. The voice actors and art were good and the story line was great because it has all the things you would expect in any Batman related film! I like the twists and turns in the Red Hood character himself and also the film really shows the comical cruelty of the Joker, which is always needed. 4 and a half stars.
Batman: Year One was good too, not as much action as Under the Red Hood (which isn't bad), but good. It's an animated version of the Batman Begins movie (because Batman Begins is based on the comic Batman Year One) and is narrated by Batman and Lt. Gordon throughout the film. The voice actors are great and so is the art. This Batman kind of looks like the combination of Batman in Justice League: New Frontier and The Batman: the Animated Series. And the villains are mostly crime lords and also introduces Catwoman.
Batman: Year One and Batman: Under the Red Hood are must sees for Batman fans and Gotham Knight is a nice addition to your collection. Overall, if you don't have these films, get this must have/see triple feature!!!",1342310400,17,2687,4.536082474226804

5145885,5,B0089TQ70Q,"This review is actually based on 1 of the movies: Under the Red Hood. I found this to be a beautiful and well done animation with a strong story. Batman Year One is also well done and a good story it is not so much my style and would get a 3 star on its own. The final movie would get a 1 star. Much of the animation is terrible, the stories are short primarily dull and confusing.",1417564800,,381,3.8974358974358974

5145893,4,B0089TQ70Q,The only thing that keeps the product from 5 stars is the fact that 3 discs are stacked on top of each other. You could consider getting a more suitable case yourself. Great films though.,1394064000,2,187,4.371428571428571
