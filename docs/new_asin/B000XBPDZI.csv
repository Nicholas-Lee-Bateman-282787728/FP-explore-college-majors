8227792,5,B000XBPDZI,"Instead of repeating other reviewers, I mainly focus on unmentioned content.

To begin with, one may be surprised to learn that Werner von Braun was already thinking about an Earth satellite in 1944, towards the height of V-2 rocket military usage, and 13 years before Sputnik. The challenges of a ballistic rocket included the cooling of the engine by flowing fuel, the steering of the rocket, and many other challenges. In the early to mid 1950's, von Braun came up with the concept of staging a rocket so that its payload could be accelerated to over 17,000 mph--the minimum speed for an orbiting satellite.

The interviewees include Sergei Khrushchev and President Eisenhower's grand-daughter.",1363910400,2,697,5.15929203539823
8227793,3,B000XBPDZI,This program has little to do with Sputnik and the Russian space program. This program is about how the USA could've been number one to space and why that didn't happen. It was done very well and it includes some interviews with the people behind von Braun's team but the title is misleading. I guess I should've read the reviews before buying it. I was looking for programs on the Russian side of things.,1354492800,,405,4.486486486486487
8227794,5,B000XBPDZI,"Back in 1957, my brother and I, aged 15 and 12 at the time, impatiently awaited the International Geophysical Year (1958), when the U.S. would launch space satellites to search for new information about our planet.  Like most other Americans of the time, we were completely confident of our country's technological supremacy, and the launch of Sputnik on October 4 left us thunderstruck and incredulous.  How could the ""dumb"" Russians have achieved such a thing?

""Sputnik Declassified"" brings all those memories back to life and, more importantly, it informs the viewer of much that we could not have known at the time--that Sputnik did nothing more sinister than beam back a mocking ""beep"" to the listening world; that the missile gap for which Democrats berated the Republicans in the 1960 election didn't exist; and, most astonishingly, that we would not have been pre-empted by the Soviets, except that President Eisenhower, in a stunning political miscalculation, figured the country wouldn't be all that concerned about the Soviets' launching a space satellite before we did.

Whether you lived through the national trauma of Sputnik or not, this documentary is an intelligent and gripping look at what would be seen as the opening gun of the U.S.-Soviet space race.  I recommend it highly.",1289692800,,1297,5.1571428571428575
8227795,5,B000XBPDZI,"NOVA: Sputnik Declassified (2007) was an excellent five star documentary on the reasons for our being second in space to orbit an earth satellite.  This DVD featured excellent footage of the V-2, Jupiter C, Explorer, and Vanguard, very good CGI effects, and informative interviews with several early space workers.

With the best of intentions, President Eisenhower wished to establish the freedom of space doctrine using a non-military civilian program to launch the Vanguard Satellite. Then after this and the necessary development of the once secret Project Corona hardware, we could orbit a reconnaissance satellite from the safe and internationally legal vantage point of earth orbit.  This was Ike's vision for space, the acquisition of hard intelligence which could keep us informed and help us to avoid a hot war with the Soviets.  That was Eisenhower's only real interest for investing in a satellite.  I understand that Ike believed that space and the moon would be there for a long time and did not believe we should be in any hurry to get there. He also appeared to believe that we had some down to earth problems to solve first.

The Russians demonstrated the freedom of space doctrine for us by their launching of Sputnik; however, as everyone knows the U.S. lost much prestige to the Soviets. After the launch of Sputnik II and the dog Lika, President Eisenhower realized he must authorize the U.S. Army's von Braun Team to launch their Explorer I satellite developed quietly with JPL.  I believe that Ike realized that this team with their successful Redstone booster rocket (modified with JPL upper stages and the Explorer I satellite) would be able to achieve earth orbit first.  Although there is nothing written to document this, I believe that many people in government felt the war with Germany was still too fresh a memory for the United States to permit that team to be a part of this prestigious accomplishment.

Again, with the best of intentions, the Naval Research Lab (NRL), a civilian agency of engineers and scientists, was selected to develop a more ambitious civilian undertaking based on experience with the successful Martin Company Viking sounding rocket.  It was known that Vanguard would use much more advanced rocket technology than Explorer, but would be a long shot to develop in time for an early history making launch.  Unfortunately, the first rushed launch attempt of the Vanguard resulted in a dramatic pad explosion and fire. However, the third Vanguard was successful and the satellite is still in orbit, a great credit to the engineering talent of NRL. Vanguard eventually orbited a 50 pound satellite in later attempts.

The Army's team of JPL and German rocket engineers were very disappointed in the decision, but under von Braun's direction worked quietly on their satellite as a backup to the Vanguard.  Army workers believed they could have orbited the first American satellite almost a year before the USSR.  After the first failure of the Navy Vanguard, the Army von Braun Team were ordered to place their Explorer I satellite in orbit. Von Braun indicated he could do it in thirty days. They were directed to take sixty, but do everything possible to make the project a success. With that short fuse it is fortunate the von Braun (under Army authorization or possibly his own), directed his team to work secretly.  Von Braun stored a selected IRBM launch vehicle under the plausible cover of being a long term storage test of Army's Redstone. If the Vanguard made it into orbit first, the stored Jupiter C would have remained a long term storage test.

So official was the order for von Braun's Team not to orbit the first American Satellite that:

1)  Earnest Stuhlinger of the von Braun Team said during his interview that he had to work at home in his garage on Jupiter C / Explorer I hardware.

2)  Lee Webster said during his interview that if the Army team had received the ""go ahead"" the US could have beaten the Russians by approximately one year.  He also knew that the launch vehicle was in storage.

3)  Randy Clinton of the von Braun Team said during his interview that in order to keep an auditor team in the dark about their progress on the secret Army satellite project he kept the Explorer I satellite in his trunk during an audit.  Officially, the von Braun Team could only do calculations and think about the problem.",1250294400,3,4393,4.881561238223418
8227796,5,B000XBPDZI,"This documentary was very interesting, as it highlighted a different angle than most historical space-flight shows.  I learned a lot from it, and I actually purchased this copy for my father for Christmas (which means on Christmas Day I will be watching it at his house!).",1225756800,,272,4.913043478260869
8227797,5,B000XBPDZI,"My brother, a rocket engineer who was placed on Werner Von Braun's staff when he was commissioned in the Army in the mid-50s and then transitioned to NASA as project manager for the last stage of the Saturn rocket that sent men to the moon, says that this is an excellent history of the earliest years of the space program.  It also presents little known information about President Eisenhower's main interest in using space for surveillance and how Sputnik solved legal and diplomatic issues holding him up.",1214006400,6,508,4.839080459770115
8227798,3,B000XBPDZI,This product has almost nothing to do with sputnik. Actual descriptions of sputnik and its launch are essentially nonexistent. It is solely the US's reaction to sputnik and other satellite projects the US had underway at the time of sputnik's launch. If you are looking for a movie on details of the Russian space program/sputnik look elsewhere. If you are looking for an overview of the German rocket programs after WWII and how the US adapted the German rockets into their own space program this is the documentary for you.,1212883200,8,525,4.844444444444444
