6853899,4,B00Q40TMRM,"It was an enjoyable light-hearted movie. However, it was more Disney than Bollywood. If that is okay with you, then get this movie. I prefer real Bollywood.",1432425600,,156,4.814814814814815
6853900,5,B00Q40TMRM,"I loved this movie! It's like the Indian version of ""Princess Diaries"" or ""The Prince & Me."" The music, scenery, and clothing were all gorgeous. The quality of the DVD is very good, too. I will watch this again and again.",1432252800,6,221,4.414634146341464
6853901,1,B00Q40TMRM,"Khoobsurat is a disgrace to the Indian movie industry.  Superficially written, badly acted and over acted, this is a movie to be definitely missed.  Do not waste your time (and money) on this one!!! Sonam Kapoor (daughter of actor Anil Kapoor, whose film this is) is wasted as an airhead of a doctor, playing to a badly written dialogue.  Her fans should watch Bewakoofiyaan (2014) as the daughter (in the film, and no relation to in real life) of the legendary Rishi Kapoor, in which she truly shines.  Kirron Kher as the petulant, combative, chatterbox mother of the heroine, gives one of her worst performances ever.  It can only be excused (maybe) by her electoral campaign that saw her elected in May 2014 to the lower house of the Indian Parliament from the Bharatiya Janata Party of the current Prime Minister Narendra Modi). Her husband Anupam Kher (a perennial and one of the finest Indian ""father"" actors) and she have been stalwart supporters of the BJP since its inception in 1980.  For her immortal performances as step-mother of Shah-Ruh Khan watch again the action comedy ""Main Hoon Na"" (2004), and of course the evergreen ""Om, Shanti Om"" (2007).",1431907200,2,1161,4.838383838383838
6853902,5,B00Q40TMRM,"I love that this movie has a few quirky characters and few quirky relationships. If you like those things, BUY THIS.",1431648000,,116,4.571428571428571
6853903,2,B00Q40TMRM,"Sonam Kapoor is no comic actress and fails miserably in this farce. What med-school gave this character a degree? Her performance was most irritating. This is a fine example of Bollywood nepotism. Somehow Daddy got Disneyt involved in this Royal fiasco. Kiron Kher, a fine character actress is dreadful as her overbearing mother. Fawad Khan gave a credible performance as the smitten 'prince'. None of the usual dazzling song and dance production expected in a Bollywood flic. Not a big budget flic by any means. Writing and direction was silly and predictable, even for Bollywood. Don't buy in to all the gushing  reviews. This movie is a royal waste of time and a waste of space.",1431216000,,681,4.870689655172414
6853904,4,B00Q40TMRM,"Khoobsurat (English translation: Beautiful) is a rollicking 2014 Hindi romantic comedy, a fun bubblegum movie. It's also a loosey-goosey remake of the same-titled 1980 classic film that was directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and starred Rekha and Rakesh Roshan. Much of the original plot has been kicked to the curb. What remains are the vivaciousness of the female lead and her contest of will with the domineering matriarch of the household in which she comes to dwell.

In this one, Sonam Kapoor is ebullience on legs. Sonam plays Dr. Mrinalini Chakravarty, intuitive and happy-go-lucky sports physiotherapist. Mili is a middle-class Punjabi girl from Delhi, so credit her for not being cowed when she's invited to the royal palace in Rajasthan to treat Shekhar Rathore (Aamir Raza Hussain), the paralyzed Raja of Sambalgarh. While in the palace, Mili is expected to, at all times, conduct herself with restraint and decorum and punctuality. Mili is not ever any of these things. She is, instead, unconventional and spontaneous and endlessly sunny. So expect her to shake up this family of noble stuffed shirts and earn the aggravation of the imperious Nirmala Devi Rathore (Ratna Pathak), the royal matriarch.

Sonam Kapoor is a lot of fun to watch, and maybe it helps that she's real easy on the eyes. Critics have sort of raked her over the coals for her lightweight performances in past movies. But I don't know about that. I realize that mileage may vary, but, me, I've always liked her. In Khoobsurat I love her easy disposition. Her character's a bit of a goof, yeah, but Mili is so lovable. I love how she's persistently such a free spirit even in such formal company. Of course, it's a given that she'll take the oppressed 17-year-old princess, Divya, under her wing. Divya, who'd rather be an actress than attend Oxford. Of course, it's a given that she'll eventually charm - or is it trick? - the stubborn Raja, he who's been confined to a wheelchair for this past decade, into accepting her help. Never mind that Mili is the 40th (41st? 42nd?) physiotherapist who's tried to get him to cooperate, and the first to have any sort of luck.

Khoobsurat takes its cues from Cinderella and from Pretty Woman and The Princess Diaries, all having something to do with the lower class girl made good. And playing the part of Prince Charming/Richard Gere/Julie Andrews is Fawad Khan - a Pakistani TV serial actor - who, here, apparently makes his Bollywood debut. You wouldn't know it. Fawad Khan is solid as the Rajput prince and cutthroat businessman, Yuvraj Vikram Singh Rathore, and superb as Sonam's primary foil. He exudes a palpable regal vibe - regal, yes, but with just enough give in him to keep him from being an unrepenting snob. Yuvraj is easy enough to like. He's engaged to a very appropriate match, the well-mannered, blue-blooded Kiara (Aditi Rao Hydari). Kiara hasn't got a shot, once Mili's entered the picture. Sonam and Fawad Khan strike up terrific chemistry. Other than Kirron Kher's strident Punjabi mama act, the humor comes across well. So, okay, there's nothing deep or original or relevant to this remake. We know the character arcs. We know who ends up with who, and whether the stubborn raja will ever get off that wheelchair. But it does the most important thing: it entertains. Sure, the plot trajectory is transparent. But it's all about the bubbly screenplay and the film's execution of it. Sonam Kapoor's effervescence and mischief making are infectious. And since this is a Bollywood joint, there are two musical numbers I liked: the palace kitchen item number ""Engine Ki Sitti"" in which Mili charms the palace staff and the nightclub party anthem ""Abhi Toh Party Shuru Hui Hai"" that serenades the end credits.

Khoobsurat runs at 128 minutes, which is short for a Bollywood picture. This DVD comes with the option for English sub-titles. Bonus stuff (a lot of it in English) includes:

- Making of KHOOBSURAT (00:19:30 minutes)
- Fawad Character Introduction:Fawad Fever (00:01:50 minutes)
- Sonam Character Introduction: Mili Madness (00:02:19 minutes)
- Making of ""Engine Ki Sitti"" (00:03:27 minutes)

- Making of ""Maa Ka Phone"" (00:02:44 minutes)
- Making of ""Baal Khade"" (00:03:42 minutes)

It turned out to be a quirky and humorous and the lead actress was pretty adorable and hard not to like.

8690258,4,B00Q40TMRM,"I liked this cute romantic-comedy. Kudos to the devastatingly handsome Fawad Khan and the funny Sonam Kapoor. This is an average opposites meet and attract movie which was well executed and carried by Khan, Kapoor and Kirron Kher. IMO this movie showcased Khan's looks and  Kapoor's comical skills. The story line is thin and predictable, but Khan with his expressive eyes and gaze, and Kapoor's and Kher's hilarious exchanges  make this a family film worth watching. I give it four stars because of the presence of Fawad Khan.",1507766400,,527,4.9772727272727275
8690259,5,B00Q40TMRM,"No this is not a chick flick... .  Absolutely delightful, fun, colorful, comecial, family movie beginning to end, beautiful locations, casting is just on the dot. The main leads are convincing, the main actress looks gorgeous and is perfect for the character.  The actress who plays the mother of the bride could have not been played by anyone else. She brought so much joy to the entire movie.  Now, casting Fawad Khan as the Prince Charming was a plus point for the movie and the guy pulls it off with so much ease.  This guy is talented, seen his other works and he pulls it off no matter what the role; he is good and he knows that, therefore his performance shines throughout the movie.  Direction is perfect.
The main reason for the movie's success is an excellent, flawless script with perfect casting.  This is a feel good movie overall, no regrets watching or purchasing a copy.",1496361600,,887,4.617834394904459
