8252011,5,B0013LRKX0,"I love Trevor Romain's books and videos.  These copies were ordered for a student who just lost her dad and for the school counselor.  Trevor Romain's work covers all sorts of topics- How to Do Homework without Throwing Up, Bullies are a Pain in the Brain, Taking the Duh Out of Divorce are just a few.  They are great easy, engaging reads with lots of practical kid-level advice.  It's like he listens to the questions in their heads and finds their vocabulary to answer.  I always kept a set of his books and videos in my classroom to share with parents, teachers, and students.  I especially like What on Earth Do You Do When Someone Dies? as a resource for the friends of the one who lost someone as well as for the grieving one.  The video includes the book in cartoon format but is an extension of it with additional resources and materials.  You can't go wrong with this one.",1419033600,,882,4.434782608695652

8252014,5,B0013LRKX0,I work with children who struggle with grief and loss.  This book proved to be very helpful working with them individually or with their family!
