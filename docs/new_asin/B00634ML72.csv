8491782,3,B00634ML72,"The title and cover of this film made me believe that it might be an action/horror flick with a faster pace, but it turns out that it's more like a horror giallo type film. There's full nudity, violence and gore, but be aware that it does get a little talky in parts. Overall, the exploitation on display is delivered in a good amount, but just don't expect all out gore and nudity from beginning to end. The directing is OK, but it isn't really that involving in between the gore and nudity.  As for the atmosphere and scenery, I didn't think it delivered in those areas. It's just best described as something to buy if you want an exploitation flick for a cheap price, but are not going to expect that much from it. There's a good full nude scene with a woman on a table, and it does have its moments of gore. However, I wouldn't pay a lot for it;  I got it for a cheap price. If you're not going to be that picky and just want an independent horror flick that has its moments and you watch a lot of Italian horror, it may be something to include in with something else to get free shipping. It's just kind of one of those things where you're looking around to add something cheap, so you don't have to pay for shipping costs and are thinking you just want some gore and a good fully nude girl. Maybe I'll like it more when I see it again, but it bored me a little in parts.

It has English subtitles. The quality is good overall, but I wanted it to be sharper. The transfer isn't anything special.",1506556800,,1500,4.201388888888889

8491785,3,B00634ML72,"Just OK, fine as white noise, not really a good movie, very low budget and it shows. The plot is fine, its the editing that struck me as being bad, its as if the actors held their pose for a second or two and then they cut to the next scene. The subtitles were sub-standard, but not terrible. I don't know Italian, but the English subtitles sometimes suggested that the Italian was translated literally sometimes. Plus I am not sure but some of the actors resembled each other and I found it hard to figure out who was who. Don't pay for this, its not worth it, if you can get it free it is OK as a time waster.",1456012800,,611,4.1
8491786,2,B00634ML72,"The film is in Italian with English subtitles so even the hearing impaired can watch a bad film. Alina works for a private investigator who are looking for some missing girls. The clues come easy and Alina (not Nina but close) goes undercover to audition for a porn studio which appears to be connected to the disappearances. The film ends as if this is going to be a crime fighting series.

The soundtrack was dubbed too loud. It was annoying as was the heavy breathing in the beginning when it was clear there was no heavy breathing. The production liked using pulsating squirting blood, even for a minor foot wound.

A cult film that will find a niche. It was like an Italian tried to make a Japanese cult ilm without having seen one.

This movie was great in that regard, and not only did it have a hot chick bounty hunter slashing her way to victory, it also had a bevy of beautiful models for her to save.  It was kind of on the dark side, which I happened to enjoy too.",1368316800,,279,4.054545454545455

8491790,2,B00634ML72,"[NINA - CRAZY SUICIDE GIRL - 2011 - Full screen - 80 minutes - Italian w/ English subtitles - directed by Christian Arioli] First, and most importantly, ignore the hyped details in the synopsis listed here, which are also on the dvd case, so no one's at fault except the rats promoting this swill. Sure, sure, ALL the ingredients for a great exploitation grindhouse paradise are depicted in the narrative, but the immature execution, lifeless acting, lousy direction and complete lack of budget negate any entertainment value entirely. So don't fall prey to the hype as I did, and often have as a lover of transgressive cinema. This clunker needs to remain under everyone's radar, except possibly the MST3K crowd and those seeking a new low in irredeemable films.

On the surface, the stratagem appears watertight - a bunch of female models are coerced into doing gonzo porno before being kidnapped by an underworld mob-run video group that has ties to a satanic cult that captures and kills in pursuit of supreme occult power who are being tracked down by a bounty-hunting female assassin who utilizes Japanese swordplay to bring dark justice to the criminals when she's not using a blow-torch to wrangle info out of sleazy smut peddlers, gangsters and druglords - so how can you screw this up, for chrissakes, when it's absolutely golden in concept? Oh, let me count the ways...

First, the female lead is wooden (leaden?) and too old for the role (a decent MILF maybe, but), exhibits no fighting skills and only uses a Katana sword once during the film - nothing like the grindhouse mixture of 70's Asian, Italian giallo and Tarantino pulp cinema influences touted here to sell this turkey. There are no highs, just lows, leaving every frame flat and thirsty for more of what we signed on for. There's a sprinkle of brutality and nudity, but not enough ultra-violence, bloodshed, undraped female flesh, satanic sleaze or indecent insanity to make a decent, enjoyable flick as described. You're better off watching a nostalgically bad but bona fide 70's Eurohorror or Italian crime drama by Fernando Di Leo (there'll be superior violence, gratuitous sleaze and better looking women) - this film wants to be those things, but comes off as disingenuous and deceptive, as well as poorly implemented. What a shame...

In short, NINA's no GIRL, you'd have to be CRAZY enough for SUICIDE to suffer through after reading this review. Spare yourself.",1347580800,,2444,4.9416058394160585
8491791,3,B00634ML72,"Chemical Burn studios has brought to our shores from Italy,A Giallo for the next generation.

From WIKIPEDIA:

Giallo (Italian pronunciation: ['d'allo], plural gialli) is an Italian 20th century genre of literature and film, which in Italian indicates crime fiction and mystery. In the English language it refers to a genre similar to the French fantastique genre and includes elements of horror fiction and eroticism. The word giallo is Italian for ""yellow"" and stems from the origin of the genre as a series of cheap paperback mystery novels with trademark yellow covers.

NINA is quite a character good with a KATANA sword and quick reflexes in trying to off herself in the tub ala russian roulette and seeking out justice for every crime breaking male.

Now,A element which is distracting-In ITALIAN with only ENGLISH subtitles,This is a real test for a movie goer.",1339545600,,869,5.098591549295775
