3101759,4,B00133KFH6,"To me this is a movie that will pull at your heart strings (as the saying goes). It's the story of four peoples lives that are changed by circumstances.  One part of the story is to do with breast cancer, the other with depression.  Both stories intertwine with each other through a bizare accident.  You could also say that it is a story of two women who must cope with personal tradgety, and how they each deal with it.  The acting is good but certainly not great other than the scenes that involve Miles Heizer (David), the pre-teen son of one of the women.  I found that his acting was very well done, especially in four different scenes where he had to act with different and somewhat difficult emotions.  For this, I think he should be commended.  Marcia Gay Harden I thought did a very good job with her part in this movie, as a woman who has to deal with breast cancer which has become terminal.  Some of her scenes are very realistic, having known people close to me who have suffered with this terrbile desease.  Lastly there is Kevin Bacon, and I could leave it at that.  I've liked Kevin Bacon over the years, but he is not what you would call, a great actor, and does a mediocor job in this move.

The plot moves around a bit, with scenes that are predictable, and some of the story a bit unbelievable, especially in todays society.  Set back 20 years, you might see something like this happen, but not today.

All in all, I enjoyed the story, but you have to be a person who doesn't mind a sad story, that has a spurts of happiness intertwines throughout the movie, and a somewhat happy ending.",1211414400,4,1608,4.373737373737374
3101760,5,B00133KFH6,"RAILS AND TIES is a quiet, well-crafted film that captures the complicated, conflicting emotions people undergo when confronted with  terminal cancer. But it's no disease-of-the-week weeper. Instead, it's a gutsy tale of a strong woman (Marcia Gay Harden) who must reassess her life after medical science has ultimately failed her.  Her anguished husband (Kevin Bacon) buries himself in his job as a railroad conductor--until a suicidal woman parks her car in front of his oncoming train. Forced to take a leave of absence while the incident is being investigated, Bacon's character must now stay at home and confront his wife's illness.

The main thrust of the story concerns the couple's encounter with the suicide victim's preteen son (Miles Heizer) with whom they develop a parental bond.  Although this twist creates new conflicts for the couple, it rekindles their lost relationship--as well as drives the film forward towards its life-affirming conclusion.

The film's performances are superb, and Alison Eastwood's direction is graceful and sublime. Micky Levy's screenplay creates characters that are truly believable and 3-dimensional, and brings us into their world so deeply that we don't want to leave.",1210550400,18,1215,5.441489361702128
3101761,2,B00133KFH6,"Hmmm, don't know much about this film? Can't blame you really, it didn't make it to many screens, and there is a good reason, it was deplorably boring and depressing. However I am sure you guess from the title what the movie revolves around.

After wondering if we will ever be saved by the suffering of Kevin Bacon movies that endlessly arrive at our doors, we are brought again to the helm of quashed-talent, only to be left short with a why-oh-why did this ever make it past pre-production. A solid cast couldn't save 'Rails and Ties', and a film like this has no saving grace and goes to show talent does not necessarily flow through the genes.

'Rails and Ties' is the directorial debut of Alison Eastwood, none other than Clint Eastwood's daughter. With that aside, Rails and Ties tells the story of a train Conducter who's wife is fighting her own battle with terminal cancer, who slams into a car of a woman who drove it onto the tracks to commit suicide, and the boy of the now dead mother, who narrowly escapes from the wreckage, and yes as predictable as you may imagine, the couple wants to more or less, adopt the lad. The kid (played rather well by Miles Heizer) goes looking for the conductor for revenge and on ensuing sappy drama onfolds. Kevin Bacon's character let's the very adorable lad move in, fully aware he is illegally haboring the boy, all in the midst of missing persons flyers throughout the town.

There is nothing short of nothing here. The film can't be saved by Harden and is so depressing throughout, it makes you want to go out yourself and drive to a railroad crossing and bon voyage.

Saw it as it's premier at the Boston Film Festival, 2.5 at best.",1206403200,7,1686,4.518032786885246

3101778,5,B00133KFH6,"This is a nice movie on topics some people avoid talking about in real life, deals with sadness and loss, and does both those things well, while telling an interesting, albeit probably not real likely to be pulled off for as long as it is in the film in real life, story.  Basically Kevin Bacon plays Tom, a train driver who is finding it hard to cope and communicate with his terminally ill wife who doesn't have long left before breast cancer will take her.  Megan is getting more and more fed up with Tom's silent and moody treatment.  Another woman tries to kill herself and her son with pills, fails that so parks her car in between the boomgates on a rail crossing. Tom who refuses his boss' pleas to stay home and be with his wife in her final days sets off in a train full of passengers and ploughs into the car killing the selfish woman while her son manages to escape.  The son doesn't understand that Tom couldn't slam on the brakes on a tight corner without derailing and killing countless passengers on board and wants his vengeance.  But he's about to find something completely different to that of which he has ever experienced before, at Tom's house.

All the main character actors do a superb job in this, from Bacon to Marcia Harden who plays his wife, to the kid played by Miles Heizer.  Even the evil foster mother played by Margo Martindale does a brilliant job, because you despise her like you should.  The film didn't wrap up everything up in the end, but I think this was a good choice as we viewers might not like the way it ended, if it went for either a realistic ending some wouldn't like it, or if Rails and Ties had gone for make some viewers happy, then others would be annoyed it became even more unrealistic than it already was.",1463270400,,1762,4.4

3101780,5,B00133KFH6,"This is a small little story. It kind of reminded me of another film <THE SON> by Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne. The only difference is Dardenne brother's movie, they keeps the child who kills the father's son. In this movie, the father is a train engineer who happens to experience a collision with a woman who purposely put her car on the railroad and couldn't stop the train. The woman wanted to kill herself.
The son of that woman survived comes to the railroad engineer mad at her mother's death. But he ends up with loving the whole family. The woman who is having a cancer and the man who was the engineer.
They wanted to keep him and even lied to the woman who tried to replaces the boy to the foster parent saying that he didn't saw the boy at all.
On the other hand, the engineer got suspended from the train company and he had a hard time as well.
But little by little he got closed with the boy and they become more like family.
His wife becomes more sick and finally dies.
Being left alone, the engineer tells the boy that we cannot run away forever cause you should go to school and all.
We are together and I won't abandone you. They finally go to meet this woman who tries to find where the boy is and tries to take him to the foster parent.
He will try to keep him as a parent for sure. The movie ends with hand in hand with the child beginning to walk to the office where the woman is working.
It is not a grandiose kind of film but rather a very small and calm story. I liked it that way and it was just the movie I wanted last night.
Sometimes I need a quiet and calm movie but heart warming one. If you are having a same mood, this is for you.",1456963200,,1663,4.08868501529052

3101796,4,B00133KFH6,"I loved this film.  Great character development as is characteristic of Eastwood films so 'good on ya' Alison.  Fans of fast-paced explosions, gun fights, unnecessary exploitive and graphic sex and profanity will definitely find it lacking.  I am a big-time Kevin Bacon fan and consider him one the best male actors of our time.  He outdoes himself and is simply superb. Marcia Gay Harden always serves up a strong and affecting performance.  Her fans will not be disappointed. While I loved this film (and will definitely watch it again) I gave it 4-stars due to its slowness to alert those who have difficulty with that.

This movie is about life....loss, love, relationships, happiness, anger, angst, miscommunication, ignorance, tenderness, insensitivity, hurt and hope...the ""gray"" area in between ""black and white"" as Harden's character tells us.  Beautifully written, beautifully directed, beautifully acted.",1437264000,,915,5.492857142857143

Plus, I'm a huge fan of both Kevin Bacon and Marcia Gay Harden.

I was somewhat stunned by one surprising scene where Marcia Gay Harden briefly examines her radical mastectomy scar, causing me to wonder if it was real or just an excellent Hollywood makeup effect?

3101820,5,B00133KFH6,"The train wreck here is symbolic of the state of the lives of the main characters at the start of the film, but it gives them the opportunity to learn about emotions and communicate them. Kevin Bacon is emotionally reserved as Tom Stark, whose wife Megan (Marcia Gay Harden) feels bereft as a result. When Davey (Miles Heizer), a boy whose mother commits suicide in front of the train Tom drives, comes into their lives, it forces them to learn to deal with their feelings, and their fears. The three main actors are excellent, as are the supporting cast, which includes Marin Hinkle (Two and a Half Men), and Margot Martindale (The Riches). This isn't a melodrama; it is a film that challenges preconceptions.",1355616000,,710,4.733870967741935

3101824,5,B00133KFH6,"A 12 year old boy's mother commits suicide using a train wreck to end her miserable life. They really don't let us understand her reason for her pain and suffering but we get to see that she is determined to take her son with her. The boy escapes from the car on the tracks at the last moment, choosing to live after exhausting all of his options to save his mother before the train hits the car. The engineer is Tom Stark who has no choice but to hit the car. His wife is dying from bone cancer and their relationship is committing suicide. Everyone in is in terrible emotional pain and suffering. The parallel stories compare the two lives and how they survive the crash. ""Rails and Ties"", under the guidance of director Alison Eastwood, tackles an implausible subject of multiple tragedies resulting in repairing personal breaks and with the able assistance of a groups of excellent actors makes a finely tune, sensitive study of little lives struggling against major odds. It is well conceived, well written (Micky Levy), well acted and sincerely moving.",1267833600,,1058,4.724324324324324

3101826,3,B00133KFH6,"This movie isn't easy to watch and is surprisingly upbeat
for the material. The orphan of a woman who parks her car in front of a train
finds the train engineer at a time when his wife is dying of cancer.
The boy becomes the focus of her existence while she waits to die and
he waits for the hearing about the woman's suicide.
The issue of him pulling the emergency brake and probably causing a derailment
takes the back seat to the family that emerges from these ashes.
A moving movie is the result that is well acted.",1263168000,,519,4.252525252525253
3101827,4,B00133KFH6,"As ""Rails and Ties"" opens, locomotive engineer Tom Stark (Kevin Bacon) is having the kind of day most of us wouldn't wish on our own worst enemy; his 41-year-old wife, Megan (Marcia Gay Harden), has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer, and a mentally ill young mother has committed suicide by parking her car directly in the path of the train he is conducting.  As is customary in such cases, Tom is put on temporary suspension pending an investigation of the crash.  He also has to come to terms with the imminent loss of his wife, who laments the fact that the couple never had a child and that she will die without ever having truly lived.  Meanwhile, the dead woman's 11-year-old son, Davey (Miles Heizer), who has miraculously escaped the tragedy (it was intended as a murder/suicide), seeks Tom out to confront him about running over his mother, but stays to find a surrogate family of sorts with Tom and Megan - with all the messy legal ramifications that that entails.

Needless to say, given the plot as outlined above, ""Rails and Ties"" isn't exactly designed to be a passel of upbeat fun.  Still, those with a taste for serious, thoughtful, humanistic dramas will find much to cherish in this film.  The Micky Levy screenplay focuses, primarily, on the complex marital relationship of Tom and Megan, as they struggle with why Tom has never been able to fully commit himself to either the marriage or the prospect of being a father.

Given all the various tragic elements that meet up in this single drama, the movie could easily have become awash in sentimentality and bathos.  Instead, the subtlety and restraint of Alison Eastwood's direction, along with the richly understated performances (especially by Harden), keep the suds from rising too much to the surface.  The result is a movie that deals authentically and truthfully with some highly unorthodox and rather touchy subject matter.  ""Rails and Ties"" may pluck on the heartstrings a little too freely at times, but the tears and throat lumps it elicits are, for the most part, honestly earned.",1260835200,,2068,4.849431818181818
3101828,5,B00133KFH6,I had to watch this movie twice to fully understand everything that just happened.  A very emotional movie.  Full of moving details about two people suffering and how something as painful as dying from cancer and losing your mate can be a vehicle for loving someone's child that you were responsible for the death of their parent.  Very moving story and I love Kevin and Marcia.  Just buy it and watch it.,1256515200,,405,4.583333333333333

I didn't foresee experiencing healing emotions, tears (of sorrow and of joy), and memories of a similar situation in my own life. The main 3 actors, famous as they are, disappear into the characters. I felt like I was sitting next to them...and in the story, myself. I had no choice but to be affected by this movie, in a meaningful way. Thank you to Kevin Bacon, (mesmerizing in this character), Marsha Gay Harden (such a beautiful, tender soul), and the young boy (simply excellence). This is one of the best Saturdays I've had in a while.",1233964800,2,673,4.711864406779661
3101833,1,B00133KFH6,"My wife and I looked forward to seeing this move because we have two adopted children, and in our family there are about 36 adopted children.  Unfortunately, we were profoundly disappointed in this movie.  What could have been a wonderful store was fatally flawed by the open dishonesty of the adults.  First, rather than trying to work through the system to adopt David, when he shows up at their doorstep, they take him in and then have to hide David from the authorities.  They openly lied to the social worker when she suspected he was with the engineer and his wife.  Could any responsible person even remotely think they would have any chance at adoption after deceiving the authorities about the child?

In defense of the engineer's wife, knowing that she was dying of cancer, she would know that she'd have no chance at adoption.  However, even that was selfish.  Here is a boy who had just lost his mother, and now the engineer's wife was trying to cultivate a loving relationship with the boy - only to leave him with another sudden loss of another significant woman in his life.  Such selfishness is inexcusable.  Could the boy ever form a mature relationship with a woman . . . to whom he would subconsciously be constantly expecting some tragedy to befall?

For those with adopted kids, the movie is worth watching, but not one I would make an extra effort to seek out.  The thought kept occurring to me that this movie must be Kevin Bacon's effort to counteract any lingering impression of him as a child molester in the movie 'The Woodsman.'  In the end, he does go to the authorities with David, but we are fortunately spared the separation from him that David would certainly face after his surrogate parents deceived the system.",1224979200,4,1746,4.685245901639345
3101834,4,B00133KFH6,"There are many things to like about his film. Like, how about ""Kind Woman,"" my favorite Buffalo Springfield song, in the background at one point--lovely song, perfect placement? Among the most annoying aspects of much contemporary cinema (and TV too for that matter) is the spacious houses that the middle class live in. Roseanne's blue-collar kitchen was the size of the kitchen at the White House. This film is cramped, moving from a  small disheleved apartment to a small, crowded house, with a garage usurped by a model train. These are the lives of ordinary folks, living as best they can.

The gripe against this film is probably that ""things are never so simple."" But I would argue that they often are, and only our narcissistic conceit makes them appear more complicated. People do best when they have someone to love and someone to love them. When a childless couple has allowed a wall to be erected, a child can enable them to not only focus on that child, but on each other as well. Love is, as I repeatedly say, not a feeling, but an action. This couple, broken and lonely and scared and isolated, found a way to look outside themselves at something larger. And in doing so, by placing someone other than themselves at the center of their universe, were able to remember why they married 15 years earlier. And the fact that Kevin Bacon had no father makes the pro-family message even more poignant. We learn how to father from our fathers; when two fatherless boys meet, one can grow into the father role, but only with lots of encouragement and love from his wife.

Now, this film is far from perfect. Kevin Bacon, looking indeed like a young Clint, is given too little to do. I realize he is the brooding loner, who had to be goaded into dating his future wife, but there is too much silence and stasis in here. The ending was both predictable and way too pat. But the emotions were real. They worked. My wife wept several times throughout. Life isn't smooth. Easy. Or simple. But it can be worked on. It can be improved, even in ugly circumstances.

This poignant tale of loss, love, and the bonds that can develop between people in extreme need, held my attention until the very end.

Kevin Bacon and Marcia Gay Harden were phenomenal in their portrayals of the couple in crisis.",1215302400,4,812,4.386666666666667
3101839,4,B00133KFH6,"RAILS & TIES, under the guidance of first time director Alison Eastwood, tackles an implausible subject of multiple tragedies resulting in repairing personal breaks and with the able assistance of a groups of excellent actors makes a finely tune, sensitive study of little lives struggling against major odds.  It is well conceived, well written (Micky Levy), well acted and sincerely moving.

 Tom Stark (Kevin Bacon) is a train engineer, married to his job as well as being married to his nurse wife Megan (Marcia Gay Harden) who is facing the ugly fact that her breast cancer is terminal.  The cancer has spread beyond Megan's body into the tenuous space that keeps a marriage glued: Megan attempts to hide her desperate need for emotional support by continuing to work as a nurse and Tom takes on extra train runs to avoid the reality that face him at home. The other side of the story is equally sad: young Davey Danner (Miles Heizer) cares of his psychologically shattered mother (Bonnie Root) and unknowingly accompanies her on a jaunt to 'see the train'  - a ploy well planned by the suicidal mother to drive in front of an oncoming train to end her life along with Davey's.  The conductor of the train is of course Tom Stark, and when Tom first sees the car on the tracks, he keeps to company policy that recommends gradual slowing rather than the danger of an abrupt stop: the result is the death of Davey's mother  but Davey escapes the crash while trying to pull his mother from the car.  The tragedies mount: Davey is left homeless, being placed in a foster home run by the cruel 'mom' (Margo Martindale) only to  escape to find the 'killer' of his mother; Tom is put on leave for the incident; Megan gets the final word that she has very little time left and is ready to leave the distant Tom.  It is this inadvertent entrance of Davey into the lives of Tom and Megan that results in a healing of three souls who are desperate for the connection of love.

While some my find the story implausible and saccharine, others will appreciate the manner in which Eastwood holds rein on the story, playing it for quiet honesty instead of explosive situations. Both Bacon and Harden deliver the quality of sophisticated performances that have marked their careers, and the remainder of the cast gives strong support - especially Eugene Byrd, Marin Hinkle, Bonnie Root, Margo Martindale, and of course Miles Heizer. This is a tough story to tell but the film holds an indelible mark on the viewer. Grady Harp, June 08",1214092800,8,2521,4.680995475113122
3101840,4,B00133KFH6,"I really liked this movie.  I had never heard of it.  I thought the acting was well done. Yes, the movie is sad, but it works.  The story comes together nicely. Defnitely is worth watching.",1214092800,9,189,4.3428571428571425
3101841,4,B00133KFH6,"A roller coaster of a film that does not stray away from the difficult movie topics of suicide and cancer. This will most likely be a must see for any train people (both scale models and in passenger size). I can see the story has already been laid out in the other reviews, boring some and impressing others so I will stick with a production review.

Kevin Bacon portrays hidden emotional tangents as well as always, he looked similar to his character from Woodsman (an often skipped but worthy film). His trademark walk/swagger shows through a couple of times but his performance was believable and in the end, convincing since he had to go from being emotionally stunted to a single parent in one week. Marcia Gay Harden was outstanding and gave her best performance to date as a dying, childless woman in a defunct marriage who had always yearned for a child. The child actor (Heizer) gave his first big performance in film here, and he does not disappoint. The roles of being caregiver to his suicidal mom, to a grieving homeless kid, to the acceptance of the man who drove the train that killed her, could not have been easy. He stumbles a few times but has the early workings and innocent face of a young River Phoenix.

The deleted scenes were so relevant to back story and the kid's time being homeless, they should have been left in just to give something to the lead characters past and present dilemmas. The two actors (in these deleted parts) gave wonderful performances but appeared nowhere else in the film; I cannot even find their credits listed.

At times, customers ask for a film that will uplift them and not make them cry, this film will not be the one I hand them. If they ask for that prolific ""good"" film with a solid story and believable characters, Rails and Ties will be on the list. The ending has been seen as a happy one, but I disagree. Spoilers following - their ambiguous stroll into that agency could only lead to misery, legal entanglements, people being fired, and probable separation - but I suppose it was the only way it could end realistically. The Eastwoods are known for their unhappy endings though, and I hope this DVD does not get overlooked.",1213488000,5,2188,4.59079283887468
3336256,4,B00133KFH6,"To me this is a movie that will pull at your heart strings (as the saying goes). It's the story of four peoples lives that are changed by circumstances.  One part of the story is to do with breast cancer, the other with depression.  Both stories intertwine with each other through a bizare accident.  You could also say that it is a story of two women who must cope with personal tradgety, and how they each deal with it.  The acting is good but certainly not great other than the scenes that involve Miles Heizer (David), the pre-teen son of one of the women.  I found that his acting was very well done, especially in four different scenes where he had to act with different and somewhat difficult emotions.  For this, I think he should be commended.  Marcia Gay Harden I thought did a very good job with her part in this movie, as a woman who has to deal with breast cancer which has become terminal.  Some of her scenes are very realistic, having known people close to me who have suffered with this terrbile desease.  Lastly there is Kevin Bacon, and I could leave it at that.  I've liked Kevin Bacon over the years, but he is not what you would call, a great actor, and does a mediocor job in this move.

The plot moves around a bit, with scenes that are predictable, and some of the story a bit unbelievable, especially in todays society.  Set back 20 years, you might see something like this happen, but not today.

All in all, I enjoyed the story, but you have to be a person who doesn't mind a sad story, that has a spurts of happiness intertwines throughout the movie, and a somewhat happy ending.",1211414400,4,1608,4.373737373737374
3336257,5,B00133KFH6,"RAILS AND TIES is a quiet, well-crafted film that captures the complicated, conflicting emotions people undergo when confronted with  terminal cancer. But it's no disease-of-the-week weeper. Instead, it's a gutsy tale of a strong woman (Marcia Gay Harden) who must reassess her life after medical science has ultimately failed her.  Her anguished husband (Kevin Bacon) buries himself in his job as a railroad conductor--until a suicidal woman parks her car in front of his oncoming train. Forced to take a leave of absence while the incident is being investigated, Bacon's character must now stay at home and confront his wife's illness.

The main thrust of the story concerns the couple's encounter with the suicide victim's preteen son (Miles Heizer) with whom they develop a parental bond.  Although this twist creates new conflicts for the couple, it rekindles their lost relationship--as well as drives the film forward towards its life-affirming conclusion.

The film's performances are superb, and Alison Eastwood's direction is graceful and sublime. Micky Levy's screenplay creates characters that are truly believable and 3-dimensional, and brings us into their world so deeply that we don't want to leave.",1210550400,18,1215,5.441489361702128
3336258,2,B00133KFH6,"Hmmm, don't know much about this film? Can't blame you really, it didn't make it to many screens, and there is a good reason, it was deplorably boring and depressing. However I am sure you guess from the title what the movie revolves around.

After wondering if we will ever be saved by the suffering of Kevin Bacon movies that endlessly arrive at our doors, we are brought again to the helm of quashed-talent, only to be left short with a why-oh-why did this ever make it past pre-production. A solid cast couldn't save 'Rails and Ties', and a film like this has no saving grace and goes to show talent does not necessarily flow through the genes.

'Rails and Ties' is the directorial debut of Alison Eastwood, none other than Clint Eastwood's daughter. With that aside, Rails and Ties tells the story of a train Conducter who's wife is fighting her own battle with terminal cancer, who slams into a car of a woman who drove it onto the tracks to commit suicide, and the boy of the now dead mother, who narrowly escapes from the wreckage, and yes as predictable as you may imagine, the couple wants to more or less, adopt the lad. The kid (played rather well by Miles Heizer) goes looking for the conductor for revenge and on ensuing sappy drama onfolds. Kevin Bacon's character let's the very adorable lad move in, fully aware he is illegally haboring the boy, all in the midst of missing persons flyers throughout the town.

There is nothing short of nothing here. The film can't be saved by Harden and is so depressing throughout, it makes you want to go out yourself and drive to a railroad crossing and bon voyage.

3336275,5,B00133KFH6,"This is a nice movie on topics some people avoid talking about in real life, deals with sadness and loss, and does both those things well, while telling an interesting, albeit probably not real likely to be pulled off for as long as it is in the film in real life, story.  Basically Kevin Bacon plays Tom, a train driver who is finding it hard to cope and communicate with his terminally ill wife who doesn't have long left before breast cancer will take her.  Megan is getting more and more fed up with Tom's silent and moody treatment.  Another woman tries to kill herself and her son with pills, fails that so parks her car in between the boomgates on a rail crossing. Tom who refuses his boss' pleas to stay home and be with his wife in her final days sets off in a train full of passengers and ploughs into the car killing the selfish woman while her son manages to escape.  The son doesn't understand that Tom couldn't slam on the brakes on a tight corner without derailing and killing countless passengers on board and wants his vengeance.  But he's about to find something completely different to that of which he has ever experienced before, at Tom's house.

All the main character actors do a superb job in this, from Bacon to Marcia Harden who plays his wife, to the kid played by Miles Heizer.  Even the evil foster mother played by Margo Martindale does a brilliant job, because you despise her like you should.  The film didn't wrap up everything up in the end, but I think this was a good choice as we viewers might not like the way it ended, if it went for either a realistic ending some wouldn't like it, or if Rails and Ties had gone for make some viewers happy, then others would be annoyed it became even more unrealistic than it already was.",1463270400,,1762,4.4

3336277,5,B00133KFH6,"This is a small little story. It kind of reminded me of another film <THE SON> by Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne. The only difference is Dardenne brother's movie, they keeps the child who kills the father's son. In this movie, the father is a train engineer who happens to experience a collision with a woman who purposely put her car on the railroad and couldn't stop the train. The woman wanted to kill herself.
The son of that woman survived comes to the railroad engineer mad at her mother's death. But he ends up with loving the whole family. The woman who is having a cancer and the man who was the engineer.
They wanted to keep him and even lied to the woman who tried to replaces the boy to the foster parent saying that he didn't saw the boy at all.
On the other hand, the engineer got suspended from the train company and he had a hard time as well.
But little by little he got closed with the boy and they become more like family.
His wife becomes more sick and finally dies.
Being left alone, the engineer tells the boy that we cannot run away forever cause you should go to school and all.
We are together and I won't abandone you. They finally go to meet this woman who tries to find where the boy is and tries to take him to the foster parent.
He will try to keep him as a parent for sure. The movie ends with hand in hand with the child beginning to walk to the office where the woman is working.

3336324,4,B00133KFH6,"As ""Rails and Ties"" opens, locomotive engineer Tom Stark (Kevin Bacon) is having the kind of day most of us wouldn't wish on our own worst enemy; his 41-year-old wife, Megan (Marcia Gay Harden), has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer, and a mentally ill young mother has committed suicide by parking her car directly in the path of the train he is conducting.  As is customary in such cases, Tom is put on temporary suspension pending an investigation of the crash.  He also has to come to terms with the imminent loss of his wife, who laments the fact that the couple never had a child and that she will die without ever having truly lived.  Meanwhile, the dead woman's 11-year-old son, Davey (Miles Heizer), who has miraculously escaped the tragedy (it was intended as a murder/suicide), seeks Tom out to confront him about running over his mother, but stays to find a surrogate family of sorts with Tom and Megan - with all the messy legal ramifications that that entails.

Needless to say, given the plot as outlined above, ""Rails and Ties"" isn't exactly designed to be a passel of upbeat fun.  Still, those with a taste for serious, thoughtful, humanistic dramas will find much to cherish in this film.  The Micky Levy screenplay focuses, primarily, on the complex marital relationship of Tom and Megan, as they struggle with why Tom has never been able to fully commit himself to either the marriage or the prospect of being a father.

Given all the various tragic elements that meet up in this single drama, the movie could easily have become awash in sentimentality and bathos.  Instead, the subtlety and restraint of Alison Eastwood's direction, along with the richly understated performances (especially by Harden), keep the suds from rising too much to the surface.  The result is a movie that deals authentically and truthfully with some highly unorthodox and rather touchy subject matter.  ""Rails and Ties"" may pluck on the heartstrings a little too freely at times, but the tears and throat lumps it elicits are, for the most part, honestly earned.",1260835200,,2068,4.849431818181818

Unfortunately, we were profoundly disappointed in this movie.  What could have been a wonderful store was fatally flawed by the open dishonesty of the adults.  First, rather than trying to work through the system to adopt David, when he shows up at their doorstep, they take him in and then have to hide David from the authorities.  They openly lied to the social worker when she suspected he was with the engineer and his wife.  Could any responsible person even remotely think they would have any chance at adoption after deceiving the authorities about the child?

In defense of the engineer's wife, knowing that she was dying of cancer, she would know that she'd have no chance at adoption.  However, even that was selfish.  Here is a boy who had just lost his mother, and now the engineer's wife was trying to cultivate a loving relationship with the boy - only to leave him with another sudden loss of another significant woman in his life.  Such selfishness is inexcusable.  Could the boy ever form a mature relationship with a woman . . . to whom he would subconsciously be constantly expecting some tragedy to befall?

For those with adopted kids, the movie is worth watching, but not one I would make an extra effort to seek out.  The thought kept occurring to me that this movie must be Kevin Bacon's effort to counteract any lingering impression of him as a child molester in the movie 'The Woodsman.'  In the end, he does go to the authorities with David, but we are fortunately spared the separation from him that David would certainly face after his surrogate parents deceived the system.",1224979200,4,1746,4.685245901639345
3336331,4,B00133KFH6,"There are many things to like about his film. Like, how about ""Kind Woman,"" my favorite Buffalo Springfield song, in the background at one point--lovely song, perfect placement? Among the most annoying aspects of much contemporary cinema (and TV too for that matter) is the spacious houses that the middle class live in. Roseanne's blue-collar kitchen was the size of the kitchen at the White House. This film is cramped, moving from a  small disheleved apartment to a small, crowded house, with a garage usurped by a model train. These are the lives of ordinary folks, living as best they can.

The gripe against this film is probably that ""things are never so simple."" But I would argue that they often are, and only our narcissistic conceit makes them appear more complicated. People do best when they have someone to love and someone to love them. When a childless couple has allowed a wall to be erected, a child can enable them to not only focus on that child, but on each other as well. Love is, as I repeatedly say, not a feeling, but an action. This couple, broken and lonely and scared and isolated, found a way to look outside themselves at something larger. And in doing so, by placing someone other than themselves at the center of their universe, were able to remember why they married 15 years earlier. And the fact that Kevin Bacon had no father makes the pro-family message even more poignant. We learn how to father from our fathers; when two fatherless boys meet, one can grow into the father role, but only with lots of encouragement and love from his wife.

Now, this film is far from perfect. Kevin Bacon, looking indeed like a young Clint, is given too little to do. I realize he is the brooding loner, who had to be goaded into dating his future wife, but there is too much silence and stasis in here. The ending was both predictable and way too pat. But the emotions were real. They worked. My wife wept several times throughout. Life isn't smooth. Easy. Or simple. But it can be worked on. It can be improved, even in ugly circumstances. Though the tears were legitimate, the tale was upbeat.",1222041600,2,2118,4.597883597883598

Growing up as a boy in south Texas, in the 50's and 60's, I had a passion for baseball and trains. They don't make enough movies with modern trains in them. And model trains, it's a kid's dream! But this movie is not about trains, it's about terminal cancer. A subject I deal with everyday at work, being a Radiologic Technologist(x-ray) at a local hospital. Not to mention, my wife's grandmother, going through the same ordeal that Marcia's character went through. One of the reviewers described the movie as deplorable, boring and depressing...Hey Mr. Movie Magic, ""Welcome to the real World"". This is one of the best movies I've seen. Depressing yes, because of it's subject content, but it happens in the real world. It's a tear jerker, but it's a great movie to watch. Kevin Bacon does not get enough credit for the great actor that he is. I love all his movies. RAILS&TIES belongs in your library. You won't be disappointed...",1215734400,,1076,4.790322580645161
3336335,4,B00133KFH6,"A train engineer and his dying wife are struggling and not coping with the crisis of her final days, weeks or months.  And then the husband is forced to confront the tragedy of a woman's ""suicide by train"", which leaves behind an orphaned boy.

When that boy shows up on their doorstep, seeking to lash out at the man whom he sees as the instrument of his mother's demise, he finds instead a sanctuary and a place of healing.

The husband and wife, by giving to the boy, are able to turn the wife's final days into a time of building new bonds and reaching out to someone in need.

This poignant tale of loss, love, and the bonds that can develop between people in extreme need, held my attention until the very end.

Kevin Bacon and Marcia Gay Harden were phenomenal in their portrayals of the couple in crisis.",1215302400,4,812,4.386666666666667
3336336,4,B00133KFH6,"RAILS & TIES, under the guidance of first time director Alison Eastwood, tackles an implausible subject of multiple tragedies resulting in repairing personal breaks and with the able assistance of a groups of excellent actors makes a finely tune, sensitive study of little lives struggling against major odds.  It is well conceived, well written (Micky Levy), well acted and sincerely moving.

 Tom Stark (Kevin Bacon) is a train engineer, married to his job as well as being married to his nurse wife Megan (Marcia Gay Harden) who is facing the ugly fact that her breast cancer is terminal.  The cancer has spread beyond Megan's body into the tenuous space that keeps a marriage glued: Megan attempts to hide her desperate need for emotional support by continuing to work as a nurse and Tom takes on extra train runs to avoid the reality that face him at home. The other side of the story is equally sad: young Davey Danner (Miles Heizer) cares of his psychologically shattered mother (Bonnie Root) and unknowingly accompanies her on a jaunt to 'see the train'  - a ploy well planned by the suicidal mother to drive in front of an oncoming train to end her life along with Davey's.  The conductor of the train is of course Tom Stark, and when Tom first sees the car on the tracks, he keeps to company policy that recommends gradual slowing rather than the danger of an abrupt stop: the result is the death of Davey's mother  but Davey escapes the crash while trying to pull his mother from the car.  The tragedies mount: Davey is left homeless, being placed in a foster home run by the cruel 'mom' (Margo Martindale) only to  escape to find the 'killer' of his mother; Tom is put on leave for the incident; Megan gets the final word that she has very little time left and is ready to leave the distant Tom.  It is this inadvertent entrance of Davey into the lives of Tom and Megan that results in a healing of three souls who are desperate for the connection of love.

While some my find the story implausible and saccharine, others will appreciate the manner in which Eastwood holds rein on the story, playing it for quiet honesty instead of explosive situations. Both Bacon and Harden deliver the quality of sophisticated performances that have marked their careers, and the remainder of the cast gives strong support - especially Eugene Byrd, Marin Hinkle, Bonnie Root, Margo Martindale, and of course Miles Heizer. This is a tough story to tell but the film holds an indelible mark on the viewer. Grady Harp, June 08",1214092800,8,2521,4.680995475113122

3336338,4,B00133KFH6,"A roller coaster of a film that does not stray away from the difficult movie topics of suicide and cancer. This will most likely be a must see for any train people (both scale models and in passenger size). I can see the story has already been laid out in the other reviews, boring some and impressing others so I will stick with a production review.

Kevin Bacon portrays hidden emotional tangents as well as always, he looked similar to his character from Woodsman (an often skipped but worthy film). His trademark walk/swagger shows through a couple of times but his performance was believable and in the end, convincing since he had to go from being emotionally stunted to a single parent in one week. Marcia Gay Harden was outstanding and gave her best performance to date as a dying, childless woman in a defunct marriage who had always yearned for a child. The child actor (Heizer) gave his first big performance in film here, and he does not disappoint. The roles of being caregiver to his suicidal mom, to a grieving homeless kid, to the acceptance of the man who drove the train that killed her, could not have been easy. He stumbles a few times but has the early workings and innocent face of a young River Phoenix.

The deleted scenes were so relevant to back story and the kid's time being homeless, they should have been left in just to give something to the lead characters past and present dilemmas. The two actors (in these deleted parts) gave wonderful performances but appeared nowhere else in the film; I cannot even find their credits listed.

At times, customers ask for a film that will uplift them and not make them cry, this film will not be the one I hand them. If they ask for that prolific ""good"" film with a solid story and believable characters, Rails and Ties will be on the list. The ending has been seen as a happy one, but I disagree. Spoilers following - their ambiguous stroll into that agency could only lead to misery, legal entanglements, people being fired, and probable separation - but I suppose it was the only way it could end realistically. The Eastwoods are known for their unhappy endings though, and I hope this DVD does not get overlooked.",1213488000,5,2188,4.59079283887468
