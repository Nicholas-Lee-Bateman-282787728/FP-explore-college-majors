8719057,4,B00YSMXKMG,"I am a big fan of Exhibition on Screen, but this was one of the ""less-gripping"" episodes of this series as shown on Amazon Prime. It deals primarily with the Barnes Collection exhibit of the 181 Renoir that Barnes purchased in the early 1900s. The paintings are often considered controversial because of the sameness of their subjects and their perceived lower quality than works Renoir completed at early and mid-points during his career. Critics interviewed in this film bash these works from Renior's latter period while Barnes' curators vigorously defend them.  I could understand the points offered by both sides.  Based on this film, I look forward to viewing some of these works in person when visiting the Barnes someday.",1508112000,3,729,5.066666666666666
8719058,5,B00YSMXKMG,"Enjoyed immensely! Beautiful look at the wonderful paintings by the impressionists from a different viewpoint. Seeing the actually entries in the books for now such famous paintings, was quite stirring. We have many DVDs about painting and still found it to be fresh and very informative. Highly recommend.",1495065600,3,306,5.395833333333333

8719061,5,B00YSMXKMG,"A thoroughly well done and educational film.  I never new about Paul Durand-Ruel before the movie.  His role in bringing impressionism and a mindset of modern art to us all is astonishing.  There are few people with such determination.  I am blown away at how dedicated he was to these artists and his belief in their work. I watched it 3 times.

Well done.",1476230400,4,357,4.515625
8719062,5,B00YSMXKMG,"I have already seen this movie and highly recommend it, it is well done and full of information generally not known by the public.  I found fascinating the role that Paul Durand-Ruel played in the lives and the success of the Impressionists and how much he was willing to risk for the Art
he believed in.",1445904000,3,304,4.428571428571429
