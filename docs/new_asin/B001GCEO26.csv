8304861,1,B001GCEO26,"i saw gasherbrum at the cinema during a herzog doc film fest at anthology film archives in NYC circa 2000. it blew my head (it was great). i saw it several times there on the big screen. somehow i lucked out and found a copy of the above DVD for a lot less then the today's going price. BUT, as was the case with a vhs version of ""how much wood could a woodchuck chuck"" i'd found, instead of herzog narrating with english subtitles in yellow at the bottom of the screen, you get some complete ""gee whiz boy howdy"" 50's era american narration/overdub that completely ruins everything. can't believe WH didn't notice this or care but it's a disaster.  MAYBE if you hadn't seen it before it might hold your interest a little. i doubt it.  come on, werner, your docs are your best work by far. why aren' they available as they appeared on celluloid? tragic.
  i can't speak to the other two docs on this DVD. haven't watched them yet. but if it's the same ""duck and cover, kids!"" narrator forget it.
