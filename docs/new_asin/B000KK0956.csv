8157645,5,B000KK0956,"I wish that they would release this on DVD because it's a very entertaining play thanks to the brilliant acting ability of Judy Davis. Out of all the movies that Judy Davis has acted in, I actually think that this stage play is the most intriguing of her performances because it's live theater.

I think that this play aired on PBS in the late 80's, as I remember seeing it on public tv around the time that I graduated from high school. If you enjoy any of Judy Davis' movies then you should definitely check out this performance even if it is only on VHS. It's worth checking out!",1208563200,,582,4.339449541284404
