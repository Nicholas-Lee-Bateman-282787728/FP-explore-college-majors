7166960,4,B00XA0O1X4,"Having seen the film before this that was about male actors, I was looking forward to seeing this. I think this is a better made film and a little more serious than the other film but no less interesting. It's kind of a cautionary tale about being an actress in Hollywood but the stories are overall inspiring to young actors, I would think. Good stuff. I look forward to the next installment in the series, whatever that might be.",1436918400,4,431,4.468354430379747
7166961,5,B00XA0O1X4,"The director Ian Roumain has done it again. I watched ""That Guy Who Was in That Thing"" a couple of years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. When I found out he had followed it up with this film I felt compelled to watch it...and I was not disappointed!
The fast paced interviews with these amazing women speaking candidly (and fearlessly!) about working as women in the entertainment industry was if anything even more intriguing than the film of their male counterparts.
I could not recommend this movie any higher - is there a 10 stars option?",1436745600,3,541,4.645833333333333
7166962,5,B00XA0O1X4,"In this documentary, a follow up to That Guy Who was in That Thing, director Ian Roumain interviews eight working actresses at varying stages of their career, with additional background and commentary provided by an experienced talent agent. The statistics of how many people come to Hollywood only to leave within a couple of years are staggering. The actresses field questions on being recognized, ageism, sexism, what it means to be a woman in Hollywood and how to make a career of it. The women being interviewed are just famous enough to be recognized but not so famous that they can talk about their challenges with losing the viewer. Ultimately the film is additional proof that it's not easy to be a woman in any walk of life. The conversations with and between the women come off as honest and are interesting. Totally worth watching (and re watching)!!",1436745600,4,862,4.831081081081081
7166963,5,B00XA0O1X4,"That Gal Who Was in That Thing is a delightful docudrama that features seven female actors. They each describe the ups and downs of their chosen careers along with the things they chose to give up in life and/or chose not to give up. The entire experience is a true pleasure to watch. The pace is fast, but each female actor (actress) is given the spotlight for enough time to allow the audience to develop a fairly intimate view of that person's life and experience, both on and off camera. It is a fascinating view of a working world that I have never had the privilege to experience. It is well done and well edited. A great job by all those involved.!",1435536000,5,655,4.377049180327869
8715570,5,B00XA0O1X4,"An interesting look at the working lives of actresses-- some of them prefer the term actors-- who we see all the time on TV shows and series and may not know much about. Plus, the film offers a realistic perspective on how women fare in Hollywood as compared to men. (Hint: lower pay, fewer parts, shorter shelf life.) Altogether worth watching.",1524700800,,345,4.672131147540983
8715571,5,B00XA0O1X4,"Thoroughly enjoyable!  I appreciate the ""style"" in which the director used to keep the flow of interviews between each actor-actress at a fast pace; it made the information and imparting message of Hollywood workplace-set culture intriguing and instantly satisfying.  Refreshing to get an ""inside"" view, as from the perceptions of women by their the experiences working in the world of performing arts.  Every woman interviewed was highly accessible; raw, forthright, intimate, comedic, surprising, unique, self effacing, vulnerable, introspective, endearing, strong and confident with plenty of seasoned fortitude and faith...  I give applause!",1522368000,2,645,5.978260869565218
8715572,5,B00XA0O1X4,"Riveting, sad, compelling. Why sad?

Because women have to go through so many things men simply do not. I hope before anyone comments they will at least watch this entire film with an open mind. I can't believe there are still people out there in 2018 who don't believe or don't understand that #MeToo is just the tip of a huge, prehistoric, gigantic, lurking iceberg.

I have never even heard of any man who was denied a job because he had children, and yet it's something women know is possible and at some point they will have to decide to become pregnant, to raise children, or to work. That topic is covered in this documentary, as is unequal pay for equal work and equal fame, the disparity in how men are 'allowed to' look or age vs. the way women are (or aren't), ageism, lookism, and racism in casting; and then...

The film barely even skips a beat, which struck me as very odd, but at one point in time the male interviewer asked Paget Brewster ""What is the worst thing that has happened to you because of your gender?"" Her face flushed and she paused a long time, before describing a sexual assault that occurred right in front of an entire crew. The shock, the self-blame, all of her reactions at the time are so typical of sexual assault survivors. Yet Ms. Brewster struggles to remain diplomatic and tactful in describing it. She stammers a bit and says it was ""really bad"" and ""illegal"" and, although asked about it, seems almost apologetic for an honest answer. The interviewer and film make no comment; it isn't even broached whether anyone was named or arrested. That is because, and this is the part the #MeToo deniers do not understand: All of this is typical in the life of a woman. The subtle or not so subtle message is: ""If you want to work *in a man's world*, this is what you put up with, so say nothing.""

And just like that the film continues as if a crime hadn't been committed for which no one has ever been brought to justice.

It was very difficult for me to pull back out of that moment, because Paget Brewster is one of my favorite actors/actresses on one of my favorite Tv shows, and this horrible thing happened to her as well, simply because of her gender. And she knew, and the audience knows, and the interviewer may have known not to state out loud, because everyone knows, that had she made an issue out of the assault, she never would've worked again.

Time's Up, Time's Up, Time's Up, it couldn't have happened any sooner but we won't go back. Thank you to all of the women who participated in this documentary. They share some solid advice on the 'acting business,' they are frank and honest about their personal and professional lives and there is so much left unsaid because the reality is far more depressing. Thank you to each of them and to the director for making this film.",1521504000,5,2825,4.465116279069767
8715573,5,B00XA0O1X4,Amazing editing. It was story telling at it's finest. I am partial to their stories so that made it easier to watch. SPOILER ALERT! Stand out scene was the blackout and return to L. Scott's story where you know she lost it then got it together and finished her narrative.  I liked that the director stayed with it.,1515628800,,314,4.413793103448276
8715574,5,B00XA0O1X4,"Love that this shows all of the different struggles actresses face! Also, love Paget so it was a must watch.",1511827200,,108,4.45
8715575,5,B00XA0O1X4,"Completely engaging from the first moment to the last. I can honestly say I knew of all the actresses but one, so hearing their stories was especially interesting to me. And I must say that L. Scott Caldwell's story about her son brought me to tears.",1510963200,,250,4.456521739130435
8715576,4,B00XA0O1X4,"A must for every actress. You'll know what to expect and how others deal with it. The one drawback is the female casting agent, who I thought was overly pessimistic. It's clear from current TV series that older women are getting more roles.",1476144000,,240,4.604651162790698
8715577,5,B00XA0O1X4,"Fantastic & heart warming, sad in places as it trails the amazing careers of some of the busiest working female actors on the planet.",1468800000,,133,4.583333333333333
8715578,1,B00XA0O1X4,Basic DVD. No extras. Exact same that was shown on showtime. Very basic quality.,1441152000,,80,4.785714285714286
8715579,5,B00XA0O1X4,"8 actresses and a Hollywood Talent Agent are asked a series of questions, on topics such as:
-Being Recognized-The Business-Male Point of View-Double Standards-Why Become an Actress-What is a Character Actor-The Bug-Age in Hollywood-Appearance-Weight-Plastic Surgery-Nudity-Sexism-Typecasting-Race-Auditioning- and -Family Business-.

I felt there wasn't a single question or issue that was not covered; answered with utmost candor and interesting to see the contrast of personalities, answering the same subject matter.  For example, the subject of -Auditioning-... usually considered a 'third rail' among actors...but here you hear Alicia Coppola say something to the effect that she viewed auditioning as part of her job/career, plus, it got her out of the house.  Cristine Rose said that she felt it was part of the job and considers it working as well....

All great questions, all great answers, put together in a fast paced format.

Loved it !",1437436800,2,950,5.661971830985915
