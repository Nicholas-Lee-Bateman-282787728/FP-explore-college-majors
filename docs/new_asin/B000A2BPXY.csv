8072405,4,B000A2BPXY,"This western is a decent entry to the cavalry-Indian theme that was a mainstay of westerns of the 1950s. The Gadsden Purchase is the basis for this tale of warfare in Arizona between the Apaches, Mexicans and Comanches, with the American troops on hand to make peace with Cochise and prevent raids by the Comanches into Mexico. The film has several nice action scenes but the editing is sloppy and diminishes its overall impact. Robert Stack and John Hodiak are the main characters with Hodiak doing well as Cochise in spite of his somewhat mannered portrayal. Stack, the future Eliot Ness, is typically no-nonsense as the cavalry major who is smitten with a Mexican woman, played by Joy Page.",1287014400,,693,4.831932773109243
