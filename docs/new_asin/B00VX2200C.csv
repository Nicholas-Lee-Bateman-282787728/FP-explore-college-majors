7113103,4,B00VX2200C,"This 1981-82 Season was BM's final season after its successful 7-year run on ABC, that I watched every Thursday night as a kid from 1975-82.

This 1981-1982 Season also takes me back to memory lane to when ABC's motto was ""ABC Is The Place"" and when I was 9 years old in the 3rd grade, and when we had all those fiscal budget cuts going on from the recession we had from 1981-1982, when Ronald Reagan was president.

I also used to watch BARNEY MILLER in reruns on TV Land, and then on WGN, and now sometimes in the mid afternoon on Antenna-TV.",1440201600,,544,4.271844660194175
