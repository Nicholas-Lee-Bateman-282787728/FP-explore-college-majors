7796568,5,1565857399,Elizabeth Vandiver is a teacher with an expert grasp of The Iliad.  It is the detail and the authoritative weighing up up of the subject that make these lectures so worthwhile. If you like lectures this course is for you.  If you learn by some other method such as needing the stimulus of action shots and photos and film they won't suit you.  These lectures are for people who can attend to the subject listening to an expert.,1360972800,9,427,4.448717948717949
7796569,1,1565857399,"With the price their asking ($700.00) for the set, you can take the courses in college and still have money left over.  This is too much for a lowly college student on financial aid and Pell Grant.  Will just have to read the book or look for the Hollywood classics.",1253318400,2,266,4.3
