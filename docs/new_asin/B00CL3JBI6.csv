Episodes were inspired by Lord of the Rings, Frankenstein, Wizard of OZ,  King Arthur and Arabian Nights.

5725854,5,B00CL3JBI6,"THANK YOU can only say so much...(even in all caps)...for FINALLY releasing these! This was the very first reincarnation of the ""SuperFriends"" that I ever saw once Cartoon Network finally moved to my local market (for the record, that episode was ""The Space Knights of Camelon."") How did I react to first seeing this? Let's just say that I witnessed the epic awesomeness that was the combined forces of Superman, Wonderwoman, personal faves Batman and Robin, and Arie...I mean, Aquaman (my bad).

As far as content (writing and character development) goes, I cannot lie to you; these episodes are not exactly the popular ""Challenge of the Superfriends"" and they're definitely not the revamped Justice League series of the mid-2000s. Additionally, yes, these episodes included the Wonder Twins and Gleek (the resident highly-despised ""Scrappy Doos"" of the Hall of Justice). But I would like to point out two things:

I'm not explaining these things to any SuperFan who doesn't know and
Among these episodes is the ""Universe of Evil"" episode! (Not even my favorite; though it does give ""Terror at 20,000 Fathoms"" a decent run for its money for me).

I cannot tell you how long SuperFans have been waiting for this release; because I, a moderate viewer, can barely contain MY excitement over this! Just when I thought this release would be left to the hands of Warner Archive, thank YOU, Warner Home Video!",1368230400,2,1403,4.987179487179487
5725855,5,B00CL3JBI6,"These Super Friends cartoons are some of the best that came out of the Super Friends series that ran on ABC Saturday morning television. But being that it is a Target exclusive, it is currently being price gouged here on Amazon for around 25 bucks. Don't give these thieves the time of day and pay the 9.99 at Target while supplies last. I got mine yesterday and I am totally happy with it.",1368230400,3,390,4.3561643835616435
5725856,5,B00CL3JBI6,"I was an avid follower of the Superfriends cartoons growing up...Superfriends and Dungeond and Dragons were my 2 favorite cartoons of all time.  Challenge of the Super Friends and this collection were my favorite collections.  Every DVD release I was hoping it was this colection, and I read countless of times that because of licensing issues (becasue some episodes has Wizard of Oz, Lord of the Rings and Frankenstein themes) these cartoons would almost never be released.  I read this this morning that Target had this as a limited time exclusive and I RAN to target and luckily they had just ONE left.

My DVD collection is now complete.  I can die a happy person...these were just as good as I remember as a kid...by far, this will go down as ther BEST DVD EVER!!!! Thank you, Thank you, THANK YOU god for giving this to us Super Friends fans...

(All I need now is a complete Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle colection and all my childhood shows will be done!!)",1368144000,2,969,4.604651162790698
5725857,5,B00CL3JBI6,"Based mostly on books (in order: 1001 Arabian Nights, any Arthur/Roundtable title you can think of, any Lord of the Rings/Hobbit offering, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Frankenstein and The Wizard of Oz), these were some of the funnest, most eye-popping Superfriends stories of their whole run: Superman is nearly destroyed when Lex Luthor strikes a Devil's bargain with evil sun creatures; Gleek dreams that he saves Middle Earth single-tail-edly, and Myxlplik sends Superman, Wonder Woman and Aquaman to Oz to follow the yellow brick road!  With the release of the final batch of shorts later this year (under the title: Season Five: A Dangerous Fate), this particular incarnation of the Justice League's adventures will be complete on DVD -- a nice blast from the past.

Sadly, there don't seem to be any special features, which is a real let-down after the ones which have graced other Superfriends collections.  True, most of those have been simple ads for other DC Comics releases.  Still, there have also been ""Pajamas & Superfriends""-type offerings, which is what matters most for nostalgia buffs like me -- the ones at whom I imagine these releases are mostly targeted.

As for this one being a Target exclusive for now, all I can say is that media products have such low margin that I can see why bricks-and-mortar stores fight tooth and nail for first dibs.  AC/DC's Black Ice album was also a Target-only release at the time, and you have to remember that not only do they expect to get the take from the biggest likely spurt of sales of the item in question itself (at the beginning of its availability), but they also expect you'll buy other stuff once you're there, which is quite reasonable given all the different types of merchandise they carry (I got a printer cartridge and some candy with my WBS disc).

I'd say Target is pricing this release very fairly, but even if you object to exclusive merchandizing in principle, buying on here should be fine.  You might also wait a while and see if this content appears on iTunes, where the aforementioned shorts have already been available for some time.  Though my faves among those shorts happen to be in said upcoming collection, I have to 'fess up that there are also some real clunkers among them (as there were among those which are already out).  So this is your last chance to get a truly high quality Superfriends collection.

Enjoy!",1368057600,15,2406,4.815533980582524
5725858,5,B00CL3JBI6,"We FINALLY have this season on DVD! Labeled as the complete season 4, this DVD contains 8 episodes from 'The World's Greatest Superfriends"". Right now it is a Target Store only Exclusive. They are selling it for $9.99, so don't get fooled and pay more than that!!

Best episode on the DVD is ""Universe of Evil"". Thats the episode where there are Evil Superfriends in the Hall of Evil!

The episodes look great to me, as WB must have did some basic cleanup on them. If your a fan of the Superfriends, this is a must have release!

I did see a preview for the complete season 5 coming to DVD in July, so be on the lookout for that as well!",1368057600,12,637,4.204918032786885
5725859,5,B00CL3JBI6,"All details mentioned by Bowbeforezod  are accurate. I just wanted to add that this currently is only available as an exclusive at Target stores released on 4/23/13. I was pleasantly surprised to find it last week, but hopefully it will have an eventual ""wide"" release.

On the other hand however it appears the 1980 ""Superfriends"" short season is finally getting a release as well (under the minnoker of ""Season 5"") The estimate street date is 7/23/13. Once this is out, this only leaves the 1981 (7 episode) seaosn remaining. I'd love to finish 2013 FINALLY having every episode of Superfriends on DVD- WB- YOU can make it Happen!",1367366400,11,632,4.842592592592593
5725860,4,B00CL3JBI6,"Ever since the first episodes of The Superfriends were released on DVD, I have been eagerly awaiting this release.  I started to believe that this season would never actually be released especially after I saw the season that I like to call ""The Wendy & Marvin Season"" released on disc.  It didn't make any sense to me since The World's Greatest Superfriends immediately followed the popular Challenge of the Superfriends.

Well, the wait is now over!  All eight episodes of the 1979 season are included.  The audio and video quality are acceptable.  If you are looking for outstanding HD quality or remastering, you will be disappointed.

What is included on the disc?  All eight episodes...and aside from a trailer for another Warner series, there are no special features at all.  This was a slight disappointment because I really would like more insight from the people who worked on this series.  That being said, I am so overjoyed that Warner finally released this season that the lack of special features is hardly a problem for me.

The episodes that are included are as follows:

1. ""Rub Three Times for Disaster""
2. ""Lex Luthor Strikes Back""
3. ""Space Knights of Camelon""
4. ""Lord of Middle Earth""
5. ""Universe of Evil""
6. ""Terror at 20,000 Fathoms""
7. ""The Super Friends Meet Frankenstein""
8. ""The Planet of Oz""",1367280000,26,1321,4.848214285714286
8582958,5,B00CL3JBI6,"This is it!! If you started collecting from the first DVD release, then you know it wasn't a journey but a struggle. Warner Bros releases of this cartoon were tortue. They released the series in no particular order. Like 1977 was first, 1983 second then maybe 1980 then 1985 show and given stupid names like ""Lost episodes"". The only thing lost were our patients.

8582959,3,B00CL3JBI6,Loved these as a kid.  painful to watch in some respects but I just can't hate the Superfriends.  I only watch the long episodes and avoid the shorter stories.  Definitely the weaker of the series,1429315200,,196,4.542857142857143

8582961,4,B00CL3JBI6,"Some of my favorite Super Friends episodes are in this collection. The no-frills packaging and presentation gets no points, but the price reflects that, and like I said, these episodes are real gems. Good stuff.",1406505600,,211,5.057142857142857
8582962,5,B00CL3JBI6,"Although only eight episodes, this 1979-80 season of the Super Friends is one of the series' best. Elements of legendary folklore and fairy tales are most prevalent in this season's storylines - to include Frankenstein, a genie, knights, trolls, the Wizard of Oz, and more. Thus, the viewer is treated to a treasure of continuous adventure, magic and intrigue. Interesting to note in this batch of episodes are the minimized appearances of each core character, especially Wonder Twins Zan and Jayna (who only activate their powers in three of the eight episodes).

One of my all-time favorite Super Friends episodes is featured in this season: Space Knights of Camelon. I especially enjoyed Wonder Woman's use of her magic lasso as a truth detector as well as her demonstrations of super strength and telepathic powers. Also enjoyable to watch was how each of the Super Friends (including a solo Robin and Gleek) captured the various knights toward the end of the episode - and the climatic joust between Batman and a villainous, amnesia-stricken Superman as the Black Knight of Camelon.

The titles of each World's Greatest Super Friends episode, as well as their original air dates, are listed below:

Episode 1 (22 Sept 1979)
""Rub Three Times for Disaster""

Episode 2 (29 Sept 1979)
""Lex Luthor Strikes Back""

Episode 3 (6 Oct 1979)
""Space Knights of Camelon""

Episode 4 (13 Oct 1979)
""The Lord of Middle Earth""

Episode 5 (20 Oct 1979)
