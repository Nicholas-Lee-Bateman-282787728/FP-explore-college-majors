474043,5,6302502667,"I've just been able to see most of these six episodes in a public screening at a college.  They cover the civil rights movement from about 1955-1965.  (There's an Eyes on the Prize II that I haven't seen, containing another six episodes about the movement after 1965.)

I came to watch the first episode with a bit of trepidation, lest the series should turn out to be a bit of white-bashing propaganda.  Instead I discovered that it was a very moving, well-edited, evenhanded, and highly absorbing documentary-- one of the best I've ever seen on any subject.  There's not too much voice-over narration; instead the series relies on actual video of the movement and interviews with the participants on all sides to recreate the era.  The video clips are amazing and speak for themselves: rallies in churches, picketing of segregated stores, black students being dragged away from whites-only lunch counters, intense and rhythmic speeches by Martin Luther King and many others, freedom rides on segregated buses, funerals of slain marchers, tense confrontations between protesters and Southern sheriffs, news footage of smoothly racist white politicians, and footage of black (and some white) activists who were beaten, sent to prison, and sometimes even killed in the fight for civil rights.  Tear gas, clubs, fire hoses, police dogs, and guns all were used on peaceful protesters-- we know that's no exaggeration because it's all on tape.

  I love the fact that the documentary seeks to tell the story of the movement through the words of those who were there, and doesn't layer much commentary or bias on top.  I felt free to draw my own conclusions, and be inspired by the courage and committment of the non-violent protestors.  This work will pull you in, even if you don't think you're interested in the civil rights movement.  Watch for the mother of a college-aged protester, who laughs and cries while relating what her son said in his phone call from jail: ""Be cool, mother.""  And the black Freedom Rider who was put in jail, where another black inmate beat him up on the order of white deputies: ""There were tears on his face.  It hurt him more than it hurt me.""

  One warning about the first video.  It deals with the 1955 lynching of 14-year-old Emmett Till, who was beaten and shot in the head, then thrown dead into a river.  Days later his body was drawn out and his mother held an open-casket funeral so that the world could see what the lynchers had done to her child.  We see a closeup of smiling, happy, Emmett Till in life-- and then an immediate cut to the horrible sight of his face in death.  The shot lasts only a second, but it was much too much for me, and I certainly wouldn't let children see it.  One can understand why that image galvanized the civil rights movement.",1109289600,13,2799,4.749482401656315
474044,5,6302502667,"This is in my view the best documentary about Black History there has ever been on TV.

Ive tried to pass on to my son the chronological facts and historical people and places. But this DVD captures the mood, fear and motivation of the day much better than me. Neither side should forget the story of the Civil Rights struggle, because it is woven tightly as a mosaic of America. The struggle, then, was not black or white; it was always red, white and blue. I can think of no better way to celebrate freedom than to remember that it was never free. This documentary is dedicated to those that paid the price.",1466380800,,690,4.52

It is inspiring, it is sad, tragic, exulting, and it gives you hope for the human spirit: both for the black people fighting for their lives and rights, and for the white people obviously slowly getting the point and becoming better people.  All this was long before my birth, but this documentary brings it all to life.

The set is no longer available for purchase there.  Regarding why a 7 disc (14 hour) DVD set cost so such, this was primarily due to the cost of securing DVD rights to all of the original music from the television broadcast episodes.  Without that music, the set would have been much cheaper, but the trade-off would have been major musical omissions/substitutions, and (just my speculation) maybe some video edits.",1430784000,,630,4.657657657657658

474808,5,6302502667,"It seems to me, everyone agrees to the quality and desirability of this excellent, must have documentary, detailing the struggles blacks have endured to achieve the equality generally taken for granted by most. I too, agree that this is fundamentally, one of the must haves in EVERY American home. All those of liberal thinking minds, who have forgotten the price that was extracted so that you could enjoy the liberties that were systematically denied those who came before. There are other products that document the struggle dating back to colonial Virginia and the first slaves arrival in the colonies, to the founders and writers of the constitution that deemed those of African descent to be only three fifths human, allowing such to be claimed as property for the enrichment of their holders to be the beneficiaries of free labor in perpetuity. I've watched and purchased many of these fine films, but none compare to this series. Although the struggle has gone on ceaselessly since the 19th Century, this documents the recent advancements with names and figures that some of us are more familiar with. Napoleon once said that it is the victors who writes history, and with that one statement, every person, descendants of slaves have little knowledge of centuries of abuse forced upon a people, simply because they could get away with it, fearing no retribution for their actions. Had this piece began at the death of Lincoln in 1865 and walked through the era of Reconstruction, showing how the defeated south slowly and brutally, regained it's control over blacks, forcing them back into slavery with violence and death, this would have been a truly splendid offering...but, as it stands, there is no lack of cruelty and violence inflicted on blacks of the twentieth century, nor shortages of those that stood to face those that wished to see segregation live forever. Nothing is sugar coated here and were it a film it would probably get a PG rating, but the content is anything but mild. The struggle was hard with many falling, making the ultimate sacrifice, so that you wouldn't have to. There is a three disc set that cover the years from 1954 through 1965, and it is affordable but not complete. We still are struggling and if you don't believe that is true, then, this set wouldn't help you anyway. The complete fourteen volume set is hard to find if you are not an educator, and it is also true that the set is expensive, coming in at just under $ 400.00, but as I see it, I never see anyone grumble about paying more than that for a pair of gym shoes that's good for a moment, or a purse that someone just have to have, well, for once, stop thinking of yourself and make an investment in something for the entire family, neighborhood and community. As it is, Black History Month is becoming a joke because there are fewer people left to pass on the stories of how America came face to face with it's racial issues and how long it took to do so and certainly, not the least of which, is how many lives, both black and white were ( given / taken ) so that you could go to any store of your choosing to purchase those overpriced gym shoes and other articles you can't seemingly live without. There was a time, not too long ago when this wasn't possible, now, think about the cost that was paid just to get to where we are today...this documentary is worth every penny you pay to get it.",1371859200,2,3402,4.6341059602649

The Eyes On The Prize series, itself, is remarkable and worth owning. But releases exist in multiple forms and with multiple titles, and it pays to be wary of what you are looking at, before buyng. The original release covered through 1965, and is still available on DVD. A few years later, additional segments (episodes 7-14, through 1985) were produced, and are available on VHS tape. PBS' American Experience ran the full series in 2010, but the complete series on DVD which is titled ""Eyes on the Prize Official PBS DVD Release"" was NEVER offered for sale to the general public- only the educational version (schools. libraries, etc) for approx $350. And there is a version that includes SOME but not ALL of the full series. As of this writing, the FULL  and the PARTIAL version are mistakenly listed together. By comparing the price of the partial version to the price of the full series, new, it implies it is the full series, but it is ABSOLUTELY NOT. Research thoroughly before purchasing.",1330214400,10,1413,6.283505154639175
474948,5,6302502667,"This is the sort of film which inspires awe at the courage of its subjects, humility at the fine execution of its filmmakers, and a certain yearning.  A film such as this can never be produced again, and certainly not on a similar budget. In this film you walk with the Little Rock Nine into class, you stand by James Meredith's side, and marvel at the massive movement Rosa Parks stirred with bus boycotts in the south.  It is, without any qualification except for the absence of a booklet or significant extras, a masterpiece that every American family of conscience should own.

I've heard all the stirring in the ranks about the fact that this, specific release of the film ends with the pivotal civil rights legislation of 1965. That's true, but it fact, 1965 was the original delimited of the classic documentary. EYES ON THE PRIZE PART 2, continues the history of the movement into the 1980's. I will buy that one, when released, but if I had to chose between ""parts"" 1 or 2, I'd choose this part. These chronicle the roots of a struggle which persists to the present day and impacts Americans of both genders, all races and affectional preferences. But it is first a tribute to the courage, faith and ingenuity of those African-Americans who lived through, and lived-out the period. I came of age with many.

Stylistically, it's different from the Ken Burns' model --which has many merits -- but whose accounts of historical events are often one step removed from the action. The producers of EYES ON THE PRIZE rely little on printed or oral narratives and more with the visual artifacts of events, some so stirring or outrageous, they help us recognize how apathetic many of the living take their responsibilities to challenge those who would steal those inviolable, Constitutional rights in a second.

As a product, the ""slipcase"" is week, and mine arrived with a huge crushed corner. Neither PBS nor Blackside ever responded to my request for a replacement.  The visual material, however, is beautifully remastered with both audio and video fine-tuned and engaging.  And yes, the price is a steal because te license-fee structure for the many words and images which appear here cost money.  The more current the material, often the higher the fees.  If this sounds like I've said, ""history is for sale in thousands of small pieces, each with its own contract,"" you're right.  The new America sees profit in everything, regardless of its primary cultural significance and educational value.  It is, in a word, voracious, and encourages me to address my representatives on potential revisions to artifacts considered to be ""public domain.""  If this seems to progressive for some customers, I respect their opposition; however there is no sane reason whatsoever why some foundation (such as the Ford Foundation which was one of several that enabled this product to happen) doesn't move in and help cure the licensor's pain.

All this aside, buy this -- the original documentary -- for yourselves, for your children and for those you respect, because they are pivotal and critical for viewers of all genders, races, national origins, ages -- I could go on.

I requested that the library acquire a second set since one or other of the videos kept disappearing.  Also scanned the internet monthly for a set I could afford for my personal collection and much to my delight I found a set on e-bay that I purchased for $60.00 four years ago.
 These episodes go from the Emmett Till murder up to the Selma march. They cover all the important events with thoroughness and sensitivity.  The courage of a broad spectrum of African American people, as a people, and not just as one or two ""heroes"" celebrated by the media, is brilliantly displayed.  Both the background organizers, and the ordinary people who had just had enough are there.
 Not that the heroes are neglected, because they are also presented in all their bravery; their realization of how dangerous a mission they were on, and their solid commitment, in spite of that realization, to risk life and limb for the freedom of a nation.  I say a nation, as it is made abundantly clear in the documentary that segregation and the denial of rights to people of color was also holding back white America.
 The other aspect of this series that I like for my classes, is that it not only speaks of what African Americans themselves did, but also of the numerous white Americans who risked their lives--or helped in sometimes open, sometimes subtle ways to end racial segregation and discrimination and to bring freedom to Americans of color all across this land.

Recently I hosted a series of viewing the episodes with discussion to follow at the University where I teach crime and justice studies.  It is amazing how astonished students who view the film are regarding the events depicted in this series.  Many young college students today take for granted what has been achieved thus far, and still don't realize that the Prize is still elusive for many.
The documentary is brilliantly produced and directed and the use of the people who were in the middle of the movement is what makes this documentary so powerful.  This documentary is inspiring to me for two reasons:  It reminds me of the work I did in the late 1960s in the Boston area and how much more work needs to be done as I teach my justice and society course.

Although anyone can sit anywhere on a bus today and eat at any lunch counter, the proliferation and expansion of the criminal justice system in the past 30 plus years, and the payment of that system from funds that used to be dedicated to greatly needed social service programs, should cause us to continue the fight of those depicted in the documentary.

474998,5,6302502667,"I was born in the post civil rights era, so all of what this series informs the viewer is all the nastiness that was going on in the U.S. in those 11 short years. A lot of what is taught in school during the Civil Rights era is very short, and usually focuses on Rosa Parks, MLK, Malcolm X, and a few others. That in itself is wrong, because this era is like a good history book, a lot of info, and a lot of characters (i.e. real people) whose courage in what they faced to help make America live up to its ideas of Equality is deserving of more than a mere footnote.
I eagerly await the conclusion to this series when the next set comes out on DVD.",1286668800,5,649,4.0
474999,5,6302502667,"Like many teachers, I used this series to support the instruction of American History, African American History and politics and government.  The main import of this series is, of course, civil rights, but the overriding import of this series is a real lesson in how democratic processes work. The people who participated in the movements chronicled here, show clearly how America awakened when its own citizens, Black and White, rose up against injustice. When I used this series to support what I taught, I stressed the fact that the majority of the players in this movement were everyday people who took stands for their beliefs. Literally overnight, many people who never had a public life came to the forefront of public life and, in the pursuit of civil rights, demonstrated before the American public, how democracy truly works. Protest is a basic American right which is constitutionally protected.  There were no major stars in these stories, just many small people who came together and created a big story that forever changed American social, political, and economic life, because they acted on their personal political and social convictions.  You can use this series to teach American history from so many different angles until its pedagogical value is limitless. I was so glad that I saw this series running in the Voting Rights Museum in Selma, Alabama a couple of years ago, because its message is timeless and of value to all of America.  This documentary should be required viewing for every high school in America.",1282435200,2,1535,5.031496062992126

475055,5,6302502667,"The people of the civil rights movement were nothing short of heroes.  They literally put their lives on the line whenever they picked up a picket sign; sat at a segregated counter or tried to get more Black Americans down south to vote ( though to do so was to invite possible violence on one-self). This documentry as painful as it is to watch should be shown in every classroom across the country.  Our youth needs to be shown what the face of hate and ignorance really looks like.  A movement started by black Americans who refused to remain second class citizens in their own country, eventually encompassed white America and stood up to a system that many believed could never be changed.

In these contemporary times where we face two wars; vanishing unions; 1 out of 10 Americans unemployed; corporations having the same rights as the individual and colleges slowly becoming accessable for only the wealthy; this documentary serves as a reminder what ""We The People"" can accomplish if we choose to do so.",1270512000,3,1012,4.765714285714286
475056,5,6302502667,"I was looking for a copy of Eyes on the Prize a few years back, when I came across a DVD copy on the PBS website for a ridiculous price of $375.00 (Teachers version). Why must such rich history which is apart of us all be so expensive? Although the price was ridiculous I had plans to buy it, so that my daughter could have a chance to witness this important piece of our history. Now that Eyes on the Prize is at an reasonable and accessible price, I hope it finds its way into many American homes. My copy has already been Pre-ordered.

This type of knowledge should be shared with everyone young and old, as well as in the classroom setting. Fast forward to today when I heard Judi Hampton on the radio, the sister of the late Henry Hampton's (Maker of the film) on the Warren Ballentine show speaking about the film being available April 6th 2010. Finally instead just reading about the Civil Rights movement which is a great start, my 7 year old daughter can now see actual footage of what transpired during that time, raw and uncut.

475058,5,6302502667,"Rattlesnakes don't commit suicide is a very effective line from this documentary. It deals with the knowledge of an enslaved and oppressed people, knowing that their oppressor will never willingly set them free. Thus begin this very thought provoking series that chronicles the 30 year span of the Civil Rights Movement from 1954 through 1984. However, this is not a thoroughly comprehensive piece because far too many figures were either omitted or appear all too briefly, chiefly, Thorogood Marshall, Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., and Malcolm X. Nor would I have you believe that the movement started in 1954, because this struggle dates back to the 16th century and was sucessfully contained and controlled until the mid 20th century. There are fine, in fact, excellent documentaries that deserve to be seen along with this one, most notably are: Africans In America; A Journey Through Slavery, ( 2 ) Reconstruction: The Second Civil War and ( 3 ) Citizen King, worthy of a look. But for the period this film covers, it is unsurpassed in what it reveals. A warning however should be noted that this is a stark, violent document that often show scenes that are very disturbing, but a necessary element to illustrate the brutality inflicted upon a people who were forcibly taken from their homes and enslaved in the new colonies, purportedly built on the principles and concepts of Freedom.  This journey begins with the Supreme Court ruling in the Brown-vs-The Board Of Education. From there we are swept along to the mobilization of the Mobile bus boycott and introduces us to the young Dr. Martin Luther King. It is my opinion that the speeches of Dr. King, alone make it a must have in every home. Far too many young people of today think that black history is what was atop the Hip-Hop charts a year ago. This is why this item should be in every home, should be viewed by everyone you know, should be recommended to every American regardless of race, because blacks alone did not overcome the situation in America. This is a truly remarkable piece to own. And in the words of Dr. King ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" Failing to view or purchase this DVD set would be a true injustice.

What I saw was heartbreaking and can't wait to own this just so I can help my child understand also. So many kids(and adults) don't understand how bad it was to be black in America. They got a raw deal and many are still trying to catch up to the American dream today. I believe this is the most important program PBS has ever done. I'm just glad that we can now buy this program at an affordable price. I also hope there is a blu ray edition coming out.

475061,5,6302502667,"Eyes on the Prize is the best and most definitive film ever created about the civil rights movement in America.  It goes from the 50s, post WWII all the way through until the end of the technical Civil Rights movement.  There is another 7 hours of footage beyond what is included in this set, and I look forward to owning that half of the series as well.  I am a teacher, and I am proud to be able to show parts of this film to my students during my study of black literature.  I fell in love with this series in college when my history professor showed us the first episode, and I have been a devoted fan ever since.  The interviews, taken years after the events, are so perfectly blended with real footage from the protests and speeches, along with beautiful recordings of freedom songs in the background, I really don't think there is any way this documentary could be improved on in any way.  The DVD should be in anyone's collection who values learning about the rich, and often disturbing, history of civil rights in America.

475062,5,6302502667,"Funny thing about history. Since it is often difficult to be definitive about things that occurred in the past (mainly due to a shortage of unbiased documentation), there will always be debate and disagreement. The beauty of Eyes on the prize is film. The camera doesn't lie. Sometimes, when people know they are being filmed, they may (or could) ""ham things up"". I'll give you that, but I don't see any of that in this series. What I do see is real events captured on film. I grew up in Massachusetts, but never went to Boston because we saw on the news where elementary aged children who were being bused to suburbian schools for integration (back in the 70's) were being turned away (or at least met with some degree of reluctance) by the citizens of those communities. I recall, barely a teenager at the time, seeing grown people throwing debris at a bus full of kids younger than me (10 yrs old and younger)because they were not welcomed at their schools. Skin color. Can you imagine a community of black people doing that to a bus full of white kids? Now, if you'd told me about that, I'd always have room in my mind for doubt. Maybe, I could reason, you were exaggerating. When we saw it on the news, we could only watch because there was no debating, no exaggeration. We saw adult white people throwing bricks at school buses filled with young kids. So startling was it that, once we were old enough to drive, and had our own cars, our own money and time to go places and do things (concerts, parties, shopping, exploring, what have you) we never went to Boston. Remember the watergate tapes? Once you hear them, you can easily recognize the president's voice. There's no denying it.

If you ever wanted to know what really went on during the Civil Rights Movement of the 50's and 60's, don't ask or read a book. Check out Eyes on the Prize, and relive a piece of American history. If only we had civil war era footage, or film from the Egyptian pyramid building committee. We don't, but we do have footage of things that happened during our lifetime (or at least mine). We know what is said of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X today, in retrospect. What was said when they were present tense? See it for yourself. Women and children being hit by the high powered water hoses, barking dogs, riot squads, tear gas, bus boycots, assassinations, martyrs, heroes, and bigger than life villains worse than anything you'll see in the movies. It's all there. It all happened. It's all true. Black people, if you think you've got it hard today, just take a look at what life was like for our grandparents (and parents).

I suggest you watch it, take a deep breath, and get out there and try to make our country a better place. I know you've been conditioned to think that kind of thing is corny, but America is coming to a point where a little corny may be just what we need. This documentary series is highly recommended, and it comes a great price. I've been looking it for years, and was ready to pay much more. I can't wait to get my copy.",1263600000,23,3043,4.4614003590664275
475063,5,6302502667,"I saw this documentary miniseries as a child numerous times on PBS around or on Black History month. Also my public school would show this PBS series during school throughout the years along with ROOTS (during the 1980's & 1990's). I would love to purchase this BOXED DVD set despite its over 400 dollar price tag. I feel that minorities & ""all"" children in America should be EDUCATED on ""BLACK HISTORY"" especially since we now have a African American President. Maybe then America as a ""whole"" can better understand why the ELECTION of our FIRST BLACK President is such a HISTORICAL event well worth celebrating & watching this documentary (which should be mandatory in all schools/Educational facilities) it would shine light on the STRUGGLE & HARDSHIPS people have faced just for MINORITIES to have EQUAL RIGHTS in this country today. So many people suffered & died just for us to have equal rights in this country. I STRONGLY encourage parents & teachers to purchase this DVD or even the VHS BOX SET of EYES ON THE PRIZE. It is VERY EDUCATIONAL & INSPIRING. If your local schools or private schools aren't teaching BLACK HISTORY courses/classes, just do like I do-I purchase these DVDs & bring them into my home to educate my 10 year old daughter on Black History. As she gets older I will more than gladly invite her friends & the students into my home to view these documentaries during BLACK HISTORY month. In conclusion I feel that this particular DVD should be produced, & curculated more than it actually is. It is REALLY DIFFICULT to find EYES ON THE PRIZE- DVD BOXED SET & when you do find it, it has a HUGE price tag on it for well over $400.00? I realize it is a 6 DVD series set, but c'mon that price is REDICULOUS! I figure each DVD should cost about $29.99 EACH, times that by 6 & you get a figure of about 179.94. So all in all, the boxed DVD set should cost no more than $200.00! Where does $400+ dollars come from? Maybe if more people purchased this item, the market value price of it will lower to some extent. Its worth a million dollars (dont get me wrong--for what it contains/footage/information/ & images of that time period- HOWEVER, its very expensive.

I may just consider downloading it online the entire series, to save some money. I have to look into doing that, at least until the price is more reasonable online.",1233964800,82,2347,4.588095238095238
