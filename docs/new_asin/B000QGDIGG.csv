8196132,1,B000QGDIGG,"The name ""Ghetto Fabulous"" is meant to be ironic.  A drug dealer states early that his trade is anything about glitzy and full of hot chicks.  Still, this had too many actors of which it was hard to differentiate.  At one point, there are captions for actors who can be clearly heard and are not using that much vernacular.  The characters say one thing and do another in haphazard fashions.

Now maybe I just got a bad copy.  But this had no menu.  The film starts and that's it.  There's no Spanish subtitles, no chapter selection options, nothing.  That just adds to the subpar quality of the DVD.

What a waste!",1303516800,,615,4.45945945945946
