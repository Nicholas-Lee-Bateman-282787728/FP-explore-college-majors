394605,4,6301928253,"Steal the Sky tells the story of how an American spy working for the Israeli's convinces an Iraqi pilot to defect and bring with him a Soviet Mig.  The Mig's were supplied to the Arab nations in their ongoing conflict with the nation of Israel, and the Mossad (Israel's) covert spy agency wanted to get one so the Air Force could understand its capabilities.

Mariel Hemingway stars as the American spy who uses seduction to convince the married Iraqi pilot (Ben Cross) to defect to Israel with the jet.  The story is excellent; however, the production value leaves a lot to be desired.  Many of the jets used were not accurate to the actual event.  Moreover, there is the usual cheese that comes with an 80's movie.  But, once again, it is a good story that shows how vital intelligence and the spy game is.",1234656000,2,808,4.537931034482758

Ben Cross played an Iraq pilot and look like it and defected to Israel. It was sad at the end, but was a set up. Enjoy.",1501027200,,243,3.9591836734693877

7818648,5,6301928253,"I bought this simply for the fact I have never seen it and Ben Cross is in it.  He plays Munir Redfa, an Iraqui pilot who was seduced by an American spy played by Mariel Hemingway, and then had no choice but to steal a mig fighter jet for the Israelis...I hated the music, but Cross's performance alone is what saved the movie.  He knows when to execute and when the hell to hold back, and that is probably why he can make any movie he is in look good! He has the Middle Eastern accent down to a T, and every time he plays a part, he plays it with as much intensity as the late Henry Fonda would have. If you watch the anger scenes and his expressions as he executes, you'll know what I am referring to here.

The story line itself is fast paced, and Hemingway's performance doesn't go so well until the scenes where she is helping Munir's wife and two kids escape from the Iraqui army.  This movie is a great find for History buffs out there, and I'm glad I found it.  I don't see why the work of Ben Cross hasn't gained much recognition over the past 20 years, but it should have.  He is truly one of the greatest actors to ever hit the big and small screens.",1255996800,,1161,4.092511013215859
7818649,3,6301928253,"First of all, this 1980s-vintage film about an Iraqi story seems incredibly dated after all of the experiences we've had with Iraq since then. It appears as though the movie was filmed partially in Egypt or Israel and doesn't give a very convincing appearance of Iraq. Most of the actors are Americans or stock Arabic-speaking actors from the time and not necessarily Iraqis. However, in spite of these drawbacks which give the film a bit of a cheesy flavor, it is an engaging version of a true story. It's definitely an interesting 1980s-era romantic war movie. The setting is the mid 1960s just before the Six Day War and before Iraq was under the control of Saddam Hussein.",1238803200,4,676,4.737288135593221
