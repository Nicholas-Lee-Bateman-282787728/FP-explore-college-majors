8427124,4,B004EKREC4,"It is a good movie, not a classic, but good. Actually a murder mystery. Rahul Roy gets murdered (of Aashiqui fame) and Govinda tries to get the murder. Manisha is his love interest, my favorite Rarah Naazz (sister of Tabu with whom Govinda made some hit films in the past) is his bhabhi and there are a host of villains as suspects. This is probably the only film so far in which you will be able to see Govinda and Shah Rukh Khan in the same movie, although not together in a ascene. Watch out for Sanjay Dutt as well and Jhonny lever in a triple role.",1301270400,,553,4.177570093457944
