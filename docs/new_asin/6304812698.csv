There is enough of the old Africa left and shown here to make it easy to imagine life when these flying boats were in service regularly -- including rebellions, lack of facilities, cross-cultural misunderstandings etc.  Glad to have seen it!",1312416000,,271,5.0
7877338,5,6304812698,"Great stuff, for a select few people down here in New Zealand this video is akin to a ""cult classic"". This documentary follows Pierre Jaunet and his crew as they test the feasibility of a modern flying adventure that will retrace the route flown by Britain's Emperial Airways flying boats through African skies in the 1930s. The aircraft they use is a cantankerous World War 2 vintage Catalina amphibious flying boat. Today by coincidence the very aircraft that Pierre Jaunet flew in 1990 today flies in New Zealand's skies and I am an active participating crew member.",999820800,4,569,4.876288659793815
