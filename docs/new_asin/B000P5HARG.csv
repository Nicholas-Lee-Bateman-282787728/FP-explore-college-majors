2811335,4,B000P5HARG,"In this movie gamera goes back to being the hero and kid lover. Only down fall to themovie is it has no english track...which to me isn't that big of a deal...since to me I get more out of the orginal language and reading subtitles than crappy dubbing.

The ""bad moster"" is really cool with kinda a combo of Godzilla and Baragon(from the gamera movie)Rummor has it that the ""gamera people"" went to toho before this film and wanted to do a godzilla vs gamera..of coarse toho said no....godzilla is in hibernation after final wars...or they would rather do final wars. Either way the bag guy kinda lumbers like godzilla.

(Few lil spoilers ahead)

Don't get me wrong this is a serious movie Zeudus( bad monster)eats people, lots of destruction...even a has some blood in it(human blood)when he eats some of the people.

The movies has lots of children in it - in fact, at the end, Gamera is saved by the children.  The Zedus monster has a great costume. Although I wish Gamera could have been a little more scary looking when grown up (like the other Gamera movies).  There is not a whole lot of monster fighting action in this one - but it more than makes up for it with the story.

It is widescreen 2:40. which is very irritating for me since all other gamera movies are full screen or widescreen 1:85. I just hate having black bars on more than half of my screen. But it is perfect for those of you who like that, especially if you do not speak chinese or japanese, since THERE IS NO ENGLISH AUDIO TRACK. You have chinese and japanese audio tracks and chinese, japanese and ENGLISH SUBTITLES. the subtitles are very readable since they are  in white on the black bars but sometimes they go too fast to be read without freezing the image.

2811342,4,B000P5HARG,"Wow, amazon finally has Gamera the Brave
available.  For those who weren't aware of
it, I believe it came out around March of 2006,
a bit more than a year ago (I bought mine off of ebay).

OK, well it's here now and I'm happy to write the
first Amazon review for it.

This movie, a celebration of Gamera's 40th
Anniversary, ""sort of"" follows the continuity
of the earlier Gamera flicks release in the
1960s and 1970s. Note that the more
recent Gamera trilogy by Shusuke Kaneko was of an
'alternate universe' Gamera, just like GMK was
an alternate universe for Godzilla. In the
Gamera trilogy 'turtles' as we know
them don't exist - kind of strange but true!
That fact isn't even mentioned
in those movies, but that's what Kaneko
had in mind.  Well, turtles do exist in
the universe of Gamera the Brave. So while
watching the opening of Gamera the Brave,
you can basically imagine it as being the
'last battle' of the original Gamera.

Gamera the Brave opens with a large adult Gamera
giving his life during an epic battle with a hoard
of gyaos (a powerful scene and a great opener)!
The village he saves reveres Gamera as a hero.
Some 30 years later, a boy named Toru finds a
peculiar but otherwise normal sized turtle egg on
an island, along with a mysterious red stone.  The
egg hatches and Toru decides to keep the turtle as
a pet, naming it Toto (not my first choice for a
name, but oh well).

Toto shortly after begins to grow larger and to
manifest Gamera-like powers, and it slowly begins to
become apparent that Gamera has somehow either
returned or reincarnated. [As an aside, my nephew is
always asking me 'Did Mothra really die? Did Godzilla
really die?""  I give him the answer I like best:  Kaiju
don't actually 'die' - as they often display a
regenrative power that allows their essence to come
back, eventually.  Well, right or wrong, it sits better
with us feeling that kaijus are mystical forces of
nature and, as such, can always return at some point
and kick LOTS of a-double-s.]

Meanwhile, a monster known as Zedus begins
reeking havok in the waters of the pacific ocean,
sinking ships etc. (Zedus looks like a variation of
a komodo dragon) and it all leads to a climactic
showdown in Nagoya, Japan.  In typical Gamera-movie
fashion, our turtle takes a fierce pounding!  This
movie, however, saves most of the fighting for the
end (there is a nice ealier battle though), and
instead spends a lot of time with character
development.  I should mention that there is
considerable character as well as emotional development
in this movie - more than you typically get in
a kaiju flick.

To its credit, the emotional aspects are not cloying
or distracting, and instead strike a pretty nice
balance.  Remember, this movie is still geared towards a
younger audience.  It's a different kind of kaiju flick
in some ways, but the kids rally for Gamera
and establish that ol' heart-to-heart connection
in a very traditional way.

Gamera is an awesome kaiju.  He's been in some amazing
flicks over his 40 years.
Do yourself a favor and don't bother comparing him
to Godzilla - there's no reason; they both have a great
deal of merit and, should they ever meet on the big screen,
I like to think they would (after a nice kaiju battle)
become friends and unite against a common threat.

Gamera the Brave is highly recommeded for all ages
and all fans of the kaiju genre!",1181606400,23,3376,4.595

2811366,4,B000P5HARG,"While the latest Gamera film is more ""kid friendly"" than the 90's trilogy, it still maintains enough death and destruction to be a watchable film for adults.  I was also impressed with how well the special effects turned out.  It is refreshing to see a film where CG isn't used as a catch all for effects.  As good as CG has gotten, there is still a very tactile realism to model and make-up effects that can still look good when done well.  As mentioned earlier, the story is aimed at children but it is taken seriously and doesn't spare the audience from the carnage that would happen when giant monsters fight or why a monster would be so bad that we would put up with Gamera's usual ""bull in a china shop"" style of heroics.  The main character does get a bit annoying with his protectiveness of and failure to accept that his ""Toto"" is Gamera.  The monster fights were done well enough to painfully leave me hungry for more.  With as well as this one turned out, it really deserves a sequel.",1426291200,,995,4.404371584699454

2811387,3,B000P5HARG,"This movie was an attempt to return Gamera to his old school roots as the Friend of Children, but IMHO it fails because it changes too much for no reason. It tries to be serious and all emotional without embracing the wacky concept of a flying turtle and giant monsters existing in the world. The entire idea is goofy and as much as I love the character, the tonal balance is all wrong. Dumb idea to change Gamera's roar from his iconic sound to a generic dino soundbite we've heard elsewhere a zillion times. Why? Also could not get past the Disney-esque eyes on this suit and the baby tusks. At least they could have used the Guardian of The Universe suit design as a starting point and worked from there. This Gamera looks like a live-action version of one of the cutesy-cute baby dinosaurs from The Land Before Time. On the good side, the bad guy monster Zedus looks pretty spiffy and the monster battles are decent.

I have the Heisei trilogy from the late 90's and all of the Showa series film (except recycled footage-heavy Gamera the Supermonster). The older Gamera films are so awesome because they're so wacked-out & surreal. They embrace the absurdity of the concept and run with it and are fun as all get out because of it. The 90's trilogy from director Shusuke Kaneko redefined the genre as a whole and gave the world a Gamera that was not only fun but also cool as hell and, by the third film, was an genuine badass. GAMERA THE BRAVE plops something as absurd as a giant flying turtle & a sea dragon into a real world setting but, unlike the Kaneko series, this attempt just doesn't work. Maybe if they had chosen a better suit design and left his roar alone I could have gotten into it a lot more. As it stands, it's just OK. I'd rather pop in Gamera VS Jiger any day over this film. Sorry, Charlie.",1393372800,2,1815,4.401785714285714

2811389,3,B000P5HARG,My kids like this movie but it was a bit boring for me. Most of the movie is centered around one kid that raises a baby Gamera that grows up to battle a monster that is attacking the city. The fighting is maybe the last 20 min. of the movie. In the beginning Gamera sacrifices himself to destroy Gyaos. 33 years later a boy finds an egg that turns out to be baby Gamera. Most of the movie is about the boy raising the turtle.,1386979200,,425,4.011764705882353
2811390,1,B000P5HARG,"Gamera is a huge, toothy, screaming, fire-breathing turtle that shoots jet flames from his orifices as he spins through the sky and space, right? Well...in this movie, he's reimagined as a Disney character complete with large, soulful eyes, goofy, squeeky noises, and a call that is recycled from countless 1970s and '80s movies and t.v shows like Duel and Knight Rider. This is NOT Gamera. In fact, the characters (mostly very annoying children) refer to this tortoise as Toto. Oh yeah, did I mention Toto's a tortoise? An African Sulcatta as it so happens. He's oh so cute and wobbly as a hatchling of about 2 inches long. His ""adorable"" antics continue until he's a bit larger...what felt like 32 hours into the movie. When his chance comes to fight a gigantic dinosaur-type thing, Toto winds up stuck head first in a building for about a half hour. Isn't that just adorable?! No. No it isn't. The iconic Gamera call and scary, toothy appearence are absent, as was my will to live about twenty five minutes into this fil. I watched til the end and then wished I'd opted for a lobotomy instead. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. There's no doubt in my mind why there was never a sequel to this ""movie.""",1384819200,5,1209,4.601851851851852
2811391,3,B000P5HARG,"Though it might still be a bit intense for small children due to the green bloody violence shown, overall this movie brings back the idea of Gamera: the Protector and Friend of all children, and is very definitely geared towards kids and families. This Gamera has morphed backward into looking more like a basic turtle (and one with big warm eyes), and less like the armor-clad reptilian warrior from outer space that he was in the trilogy released in the mid-90's, but it is still a welcome addition to the Gamera mythos. I've heard it is the last one they will make, but I hope that Gamera will be back. :-)",1379721600,,609,4.495495495495495
2811392,5,B000P5HARG,"Having just watched all the 1990's Gamera movies from the trilogy set on blu-ray i was shocked that I hadn't heard of this one. So my search began for it all around town, couldn't find it....
Thanks to Amazon and the fact you can find just about anything, I purchased and LOVE this one. It's so cool seeing Gamera/Toto grow from an egg to an ass kicker. Highly recommend this movie if you're an old school fan of Gamera or if you're a new fan, hell if you're just a fan of Kaiju movies in general. You will not be disappointed.",1378944000,,527,4.227722772277228
2811403,4,B000P5HARG,"""Gamera the Brave"" is a surprisingly thoughtful and downright adorable movie (especially considering that it's about giant monsters). While it's aimed at children, sentimental adults (a category that includes yours truly) should love it, too.

The film is the latest in a long series of movies featuring Gamera, a giant turtle who serves as a sort of cinematic rival to Godzilla. Prior to this entry, Gamera had appeared in a highly acclaimed film trilogy during the 1990s, which had a fairly dark and serious tone. By contrast, ""Gamera the Brave"" is more lighthearted and cheerful. And while many fans prefer the 1990s trilogy to this movie, I must respectfully disagree.

To me, ""Gamera the Brave"" is one of the most unique Japanese monster movies, and therefore one of the best. Most films in the genre are fairly predictable; they focus almost exclusively on the military and scientists, feel very plot-heavy, and tend to have dull human characters. By contrast, this Gamera film focuses on the relationship between a widowed father and his son, and actually does a very good job of making these characters sympathetic. Even relatively minor characters, like the family's neighbors, are well-drawn and likable. In short, this movie dares to ask the question ""how would a 'normal' family be impacted by a giant monster attack?"" It's a great change of pace, coming after 50-odd years of formulaic monster movies.

The film also boasts some good direction, better-than-average special effects (especially for the genre), and a really beautiful setting. Meanwhile, if you prefer monster mayhem to scenes of character development, you may be impressed by the well-staged battle at the end, which features tons of extras, chaos and debris.

As for the product itself - well, I've seen the film on both DVD and Blu Ray, and the Blu Ray print is clearly superior. (For example, the opening battle sequence is murky on DVD, but quite clear on Blu Ray.) Unfortunately, another reviewer mentioned that the Blu Ray has some trouble with its 5.1 sound; and since I don't have that setup, I can't comment on whether the problem is universal. Anyway, both versions feature a pretty interesting special feature, which starts as a ""director's lecture"" and segues into a more traditional making-of documentary. Rounding out the special features, you get a nice selection of trailers for other, equally bizarre movies.  Overall, I'm impressed with both the movie and its presentation.",1367971200,3,2469,5.116625310173697

2811406,2,B000P5HARG,"*note this review is about the DVD itself not the film* The film itself is not one of my favorite Gamera films, but it is passable, and my kids enjoy it. However the BRD itself suffers from audio problems. At some points you can actually hear background audio from other portions of the film in the wrong place. I have attempted to contact MB/TS multiple times requesting a simple replacement with no response. Other fans have noted this defect making me think it may be on a good portion of the manufactured BRD's if not all. It's so sad that a company that brought us so many fine films in the past 10 years has fallen so far. (feel free to Google MB's issues with Toho and Destroy All Monsters, Godzilla vs Megalon, and tax issues in 2012) Just stick with the DVD if you already have it, no reason to upgrade to BRD since it is defective unless MB publicizes a campaign to replace the defective BRD's",1359331200,4,903,4.380952380952381
2811407,5,B000P5HARG,"I usually am not a big fan of monster movies, but this one is an exception. ""Gamera the brave"" offers a better, more complex story than most monster movies, the camera-work is also excellent and the cinemascope-format is well used. For me the star of this movie however is not Gamera, but Ry Tomioka who plays the boy Toru. He does a wonderful job and it's sad he never made another movie after this one. I love this movie.

From the technical aspects the Blu-ray is not an upgrade in every way: while the picture quality is excellent and is a pleasure even on big screens, the technicians were more than sloppy with the sound. At least my Blu-Ray - marked as featuring Stereo-sound as well as DTS-HD-MA 5.1 in Japanese and English - offers only Stereo, even on the 5.1 track. My playerr recognises the 5.1-Mix, but the surround channels carry no sound. This is very regrettable since the previously released DVD offers a true 5.1-mix.
I  am quite sure the Blu-Ray was supposed to offer this as well, but somebody goofed.
Regretably Tokyo Shock does not offer a contact on their website. I strongly hope that there will be a corrected version of the Blu-Ray available soon.",1358121600,3,1173,4.607655502392345

2811411,1,B000P5HARG,"I'm going to do my best to pretend I didn't see this movie.  I'm going to try hard to ignore the queasy feeling it left and overlook the brain cells it killed.  This is the way you destroy a franchise; discount the great strides it made with the 1990's trilogy by Shusuke Kaneko, making them null and void, and returning Gamera back to the whiny kiddy fare of decades past.  I can't believe they thought this was making progress, taking a giant leap backwards and tripping in the bargain.

I watched most of this movie in stunned disbelief.  When I wasn't cringing, I was clutching my remote, debating whether to put me out of my misery or trudge forward to the bitter end.  Never has 96 minutes felt so long.  All that fabulous technology wasted on a pitiful story about a neglected boy and the cutesy wootsy widdle turtle he finds on a miniscule island and raises to be the cutesy wootsy enormous turtle Gamera #574,291.  The disparity between this new cartoonish turtle and the Jurassic Park-like monster he must battle to the death is sheer lunacy.  It's a ridiculous challenge: in this corner we have a.......toy, in that corner a MONSTER!  The unwieldy fight sequence is never made more absurd than when Gamera is pitched into a skyscraper where he becomes stuck, butt to the wind, needing to be saved by a red glowing thingy-thing tossed down his gaping maw.

2811426,2,B000P5HARG,"Ouch, ""Gamera the Brave"" is the worst Gamera movie of all time, severely lacking the fun and excitement that has characterized all the earlier Gamera films.

The story is not bad, and the special effects are pretty good.  The problem is in the pacing and the focus on tedious sentimentalism instead of action and adventure.  There are way too many scenes of little kids being sad because of a dead relative, and way too many scenes in which kids express their love of Gamera.  Not only are these scenes too common, they are way too long.  The kids end up repeating themselves, ""Gamera, please don't die.... Gamera you can't die... Gamera, don't blow your self up... Gamera, please don't kill yourself....""  These kinds of scenes belong in a Gamera movie, but a movie only needs a few of them, and they should be short, so they have an emotional impact; in this movie these scenes become absurd and annoying through repetition.

The action scenes are few, and the monster designs, while not bad, are not very memorable.  Over the course of the movie Gamera grows from a few inches long to giant-sized, but even giant-sized he retains big goo-goo baby eyes; I would have preferred to see a fully grown and fearsome Gamera in the climax.  The villain monster is a somewhat generic T-rex/Godzilla thing.  Also, there are is no military action in this movie; I like seeing tanks, fighter planes, artillery batteries, et al attacking the monsters, but this movie has nothing of that sort going on.

A kid finding a baby Gamera and raising it, and then suffering anxiety as it has to fight an evil monster to the death is a good idea for a movie, but this movie has the proportion of sappy sentimental scenes to awesome fight scenes all wrong.  Too bad.",1294790400,2,1746,4.651465798045603
2811427,5,B000P5HARG,I found out about this movie by accident while surfing For Japanese monster classics. I loved the 90's trilogy.  I also have a few of the 60's Gamera's.

2811443,4,B000P5HARG,"If you heard of the previous, and fantastic, Gamera Trilogy (Guardian of the Universe, Attack of Legion, and Revenge of Iris) from the 90s... it would appear that this movie actually re-boots the mythology *again* to make a new series.  I would disagree with that, however.  While it is definitely a different narrative world then the ""Heisei"" era movies... this one could actually be seen as a direct sequel to the original Showa-era films that ended in the 70s.  (In fact, the opening scene takes place in the 70s before flashing forward to modern day)

While Gamera himself (herself?) looks more ""cute"" then his previous bad-ass incarnations, it works in context because he's essentially a kid.  And along with the story, it ties very nicely into the old idea of Gamera being ""The Guardian of Children"", re-interpreted for a new era, and getting that title more organically then in the original series (which never really explained that part... he just was).  And you still get the sense that he will eventually become the bad-ass-looking awesomeness  that we fans know he is.

The story might seem a little heavy-handed at times... especially with dealing with all the child actors.  You might get the sense that the filmmakers are trying to deliberately and blatantly pull at your heart-strings... such as tearful monologues, and a ""relay race"" scene that might seem a little much to some.  But not to me.  Frankly, I think it works... very well, I might add.  I really enjoyed this movie, and am pleased to put it alongside my other Gamera DVDs.  I hope they continue this series with the same quality story and effects, as I'd love to see this Gamera grow and evolve further.",1256860800,10,1682,4.818815331010453

Okay - deep breath - recovered now. ASIDE from the absolute adorable-ness of Toto/Gamera, I quite enjoyed this movie. Overall, it was nicely put together and quite entertaining.
As mentioned in other reviews, though, this movie really centers around the main character (can't remember his name, I'm ashamed to say) and his relationship with Toto/Gamera. Having lost his mother recently, the boy makes friends with a baby turtle. He names the turtle Toto, which is what his mother used to call him. Now a monster has appeared. The boy and his friends begin to suspect that Toto is a new Gamera... but the last Gamera sacrificed itself to save the city. Is Toto Gamera? If he fights the monster, will he die?
If you're just looking for two monsters beating each other up, there's not a lot of that here. Toto doesn't even actually become Gamera until almost the end of the movie. That's just not what the movie's about.
Some good and bad stuff:
Good- The kid. Face it, movie kids always have the potential to be REALLY annoying (have you seen any of the old Gamera movies?), but that's not a problem here.
The turtle. As mentioned before, it's just so darned cute. There are a couple parts that I felt were a bit *too* cute (the kitchen scene was a bit much), but it is a children's movie.
Zebus. Not a very special monster. Just a big pinkish lizardy thing. I consider that to be a plus in this case. Given that the monster battle is a less important part of the story than the characters/relationships, I'm glad they didn't go nuts with a super-mega-ultra-powerful whatsis. Something like Legion (from the other Gamera series) would have been terribly out of place here.
Bad- The red pearl. Not Gamera's red stone. I'm talking about the one that guy ( I suck at names) uses to make the bracelet for his daughter before her surgery. The scientists have some as well. WHY are they so tacky? I've seen better looking stuff at the dollar store. Maybe that's just me. Oh well.
Weird- The whole ""Kidnap Gamera and Take Him to Our Secret Lab So We Can Pump Him Full Of Red Liquid We Made From These (Tacky) Red Pearls"" thing. They try to explain that the (tacky) red pearls are bits left over from the last Gamera and they're full of ""Gamera Energy"" or something like that, but it definitely feels like a speedbump in the movie.
The Red Stone Relay. Very dramatic and inspirational. But the whole time, I kept thinking ""Gamera is a friend to all children."" Maybe these kids know that...have *they* seen the old movies?
Wrap up:  I do recommend this movie if you are a Gamera fan. Just remember, this is not a movie about two monsters. It's about a boy and his turtle.",1255651200,5,2851,4.579256360078278

2811448,3,B000P5HARG,"""Gamera the Brave"" is yet another reboot on yet another classic kaiju franchise.  Is it good?  Well yeah.  Is it a massive disappointment considering the quality of the last three films? Very much so.  Gamera was always a second-stringer at best.  He was created to cash in on the success of Godzilla, but his films became embarrassingly kid-friendly much faster.  Oddly enough, a lot of his films were actually more violent then Godzilla's as the big turtle would routinely bleed blue like a hemophiliac even when struck on the shell.  But as an adult it's hard not to roll your eyes at a giant monster with such a ridiculously happy theme-song who regularly has to take on-the-fly combat advice from children to win his battles.  Friend to all children, they say.  Godzilla was never THAT lame.  But then director Shusuke Kaneko (who would later have success with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Note/dp/B0017SVH5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Note</a>&nbsp;films) got ahold of the giant turtle and it all changed.  His 90's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gamera-Trilogy/dp/B0002LE8WS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gamera Trilogy</a>&nbsp;not only easily bested the Godzilla films of the day, but set a new very high bar for the entire kaiju genre.  For the first time, Gamera was legitimately cool.  Apparently Kadokawa Pictures wasn't particularly impressed and decided to celebrate the Gamera's 40th birthday (and his rival Godzilla's retirement) by taking him back to his roots.

Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers/dp/B000VR0570/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers</a>&nbsp;was a story about a boy and his car, ""Gamera the Brave"" is about a (younger) boy and his pet turtle.  We are greeted with a totally sweet flashback featuring a very awesome-looking Gamera battling a flock of Gaos -his most recognizable foe- and losing.  The kaiju self-destructs as the bat-like beasts attempt to eat him alive, killing them and saving the people of Japan.  This is possibly an attempt to soften the fans' annoyance with the last film's cliffhanger finale, which showed Big Green flying into battle with a swarm of Gaos against impossible odds before ending right then and there.  I appreciate the gesture, and indeed this scene is very like the trilogy.  I wish the whole film was that good.  Unfortunately, what follows is a supercute tale of a chibi turtle and the boy who found him as an egg and loved him.  Soon he notices his new pet has a strange growth rate and can fly (apparently using pixie dust).  After a ton of kiddie-flick cheese the turtle becomes very large and eventually disappears just in time for a REAL monster to show up.  Zedus is his name and gobbling up humans like a bear chows down on grubs is his game.  He looks a bit like a cross between between the American kaiju known as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GINO/dp/0767817478/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GINO</a>&nbsp;(Godzilla In Name Only) and a mythical dragon.  Very cool.  No complaints there.  Well, Zedus is about to chow down on the leads when guess who appears to save the day, lame new upbeat theme music and all.

Even when battling totally menacing gigantic monsters, this Gamera (named Toto by the kid) is cute as a button. I'll admit he has much more expressive features then any other kaiju I've seen and the guy's got spunk, but his ""resolve face"" makes him look like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bolt/dp/B001OMU6V6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bolt</a>. Yes, the CG dog. Despite being extremely overmatched, Gamera uses his head and manages to fend the massive beast off before collapsing due to a neck wound delivered by Zedus's spear-like tongue.  Then the movie gets dumb.  Zedus eventually gets hungry again, and Gamera is forced to face him in the open city where he gets heat down for a very long time.  Meanwhile, every kid in the city is apparently running towards the battle in what must be a weird attempt at mass suicide.  And they are carrying some red glowy thing that somehow every kid in the city knows will make Gamera strong again and they all seem to somehow know his name is Toto, and they do this relay for life thing that is just retarded and then the little boy who raised Toto has his dad (worst parent ever) take him up to a partially-demolished building to have a heart-to-heart with the giant turtle and make a nonsuicide pact with him while Zedus stabs him in the side.  Christ, is this really the best they could come up with for the return of a kaiju icon?

Stupid kiddie-flick nonsense aside, ""Gamera the Brave"" is pretty entertaining.  I'm cutting it some slack on the rating because it is a children's film (although a violent one) and they are being true to the roots of the character.  In most ways, this is a fitting tribute to Gamera's film legacy which, while cheesy as hell today, definitely made my childhood a happier one.  But any way you look at it, it's a step waaaaay back from the excellent 90's trilogy.  There's not enough fire-breathing, all the kids get on my nerves, Gamera looks like a giant pinwheel when he finally busts his legendary flying-saucer act out, and the final fight could have been better paced.  But the movie overall is a good time due to a great-looking adversary and some solid kaiju action. This is better then the dreaded&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rebirth-of-Mothra/dp/B00003L9CE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rebirth of Mothra</a>&nbsp;films, but I'm definitely ready for Godzilla to come back now.",1249171200,11,5755,5.4965909090909095

2811473,5,B000P5HARG,"Firstly, I know a lot of people talk really highly of the 90s Gamera movies, but I have only seen the first one. I have seen most of the Showa entries.

Now, with all that said, this was a very solid Gamera movie. While I'm partial to Godzilla, I really enjoyed this. The child's story is a nice throwback to the older Showa movies were children were at the center of the story. The effects were brilliant and Zedus was an impressive adversary. The climax was great. The children relaying the stone was powerful, though, admittedly, I predicted it. The shot early on where the knife nearly falls on Toto reminded me a little of Guiron, and I think that might have been another shout-out. The movie opened with the aged Gamera fighting Gyaos, which is appropriate, since, next to Gamera, the Gyoas have been in the most films and are the second most popular kaiju of the series. Personally, I would have liked to see Vilas or Zigra make another appearance.

So, the movie's got a lot of retro-charm and some crazy-good special effects, but there's a down side.

Firstly, who the crap is Zedus? The movie doesn't do very much explaining there. The red stone also goes the whole movie without a proper explanation. ""Toto came with this red stone,"" to which I might add, ""...so?""

But the child is very believable. The hospitalized little girl reminds me a little of the girl in Gamera: Guardian of the Universe.

So, the downs aren't major. Perhaps I'm just missing something. Wouldn't be the first time. It's a great movie. I proudly own it.",1240531200,4,1539,4.602189781021898

2811478,1,B000P5HARG,"++Please note I watched the English language version of this+++I love Kajiu - giant monster movies, but this was the pits. A kid who lost his mother finds an egg with Gamera, who he calls Toto (a wizard of oz reference?) and doesn't want to accept that he is Gamera despite that he grows to giant monster size & breathes fire. He tells Gamera/Toto ""I love you"". All these kids calling him Toto was just too stupid. This kid was worse than any kid who befriended Gamera back in the 1960s & boy were there some real doozies back then. I felt that this movie was worse than any 1960s Gamera movie except for Super Monster Gamera. I felt like I was watching a piss poor version of ET with Gamera. Gamera looks terrible in this with those big goofy eyes. The kid annoyed me after awhile chasing Gamera/Toto everywhere. The best part of the movie was at the beginning where the first Gamera fought a trio of Gyaos; it went downhill from there. Little toto/Gamera was cute, but I don't like giant monsters being in cutesy movies. I didn't like that aspect of this film,which is supposedly for kids..
They call it a kids movie,but I think some kids might be squeamish watching colorful blood squirt from the monsters, while some kids will think all these kids in this film are either stupid or need psychiatric help. Of course some kids will love it, since Toto/Gamera is cute in this. Unappealing and just plain dumb on so many levels. They amplified the Gamera loves kids theme to make it worse than any Gamera movie from the 60s. They might have been goofy at times, but at least themes and plots were not quite as dumb as this (well maybe Gamera vs Zigra).  Gamera's foe came out of nowhere, no origin or anything, just a monster shows up. It is a decent creation but no real personality,just a monster for Gamera to fight.
This Gamera movie I was totally disappointed with considering the 1990s Gamera movies were really well done. Overblown kiddie stuff, and just not the way I used to really enjoy Kaiju back in the day. This made Gamera vs Zigra look like an Oscar Award winner. I didn't bother with the Japanese version as I was not into the movie at all to see it a 2nd time.

However, seeing it... Gamera The Brave exheeded expectations. The thing it had against it was how can another Gamera film top Shusuke Kaneko's terrific 90's trilogy of films? Well, it doesn't top it and doesn't need to-you don't have to make comparisons-it's apples and oranges. GAMERA THE BRAVE is it's own little film, that happens yet again, in another timeline, another ""Gamera Universe"" as it were. The film opens with a terrific ""retro"" battle, in 1973, with Gamera and several Gyaos flying monsters-witnessed by among others, a young boy(All of the cast here are dressed appropriately in 1970's clothes and have 70's haircuts-a nice detail). Gamera, shown full grown in 1973, is re-imagined and much more of a gnarled-looking giant tortoise. This takes place all during the credits with some fantastic and unique music in the background soundtrack. A massive explosion and Gamera is gone-with the Gyaos. Flash forward to 2006 when a young boy-the son of the young boy we first see in 1973 but all grown up- finds a small egg on what's left of the island Gamera made his last stand on. The egg hatches into a small turtle which keeps on getting bigger. Meanwhile, the Japanese government announces it is disbanding the division of the military who dealt with giant monsters, since none have been seen since 1973. Elsewhere, ships begin disappearing mysteriously...as the small Gamera-named ""Toto""- grows ever more...and senses something is not right.

The film has terrific visual effects. Flawless, I'd even say wih regards to matting and working in digital CG work with old-school rubber suits and miniatures. There is also some great character development and, at the end of the film, it adds up to a coherent, memorable and ""quiet"" giant monster film that leaves you with a good feeling. It entertains adults as much as kids-a rarity. There's also some genuinely funny scenes including an in-joke to the 1960's films.

GAMERA THE BRAVE came out quietly in Japan, never took off at the box office and, failed leading many filmmakers to conclude once and for all, that the Kaiju Eiga genre is dead to audiences there.

2811482,2,B000P5HARG,"I'm a big fan of Japan's Gamera movies, even the sillier ones made almost 40 years ago with titles like GAMERA VS. ZYGRA and GAMERA VS. JIGER. The three most recent ones preceding GAMERA THE BRAVE, all made from 1995-99, are masterpieces of the 'kaiju'--giant monster--genre (GAMERA: GUARDIAN OF THE UNIVERSE, GAMERA 2: ADVENT OF LEGION, GAMERA 3: REVENGE OF IRIS). So what went wrong with GAMERA THE BRAVE (2005)? Well, for one thing, it takes itself way too seriously and treats the dramatic scenes of a single father and his emotionally-deprived son as if this were some heart-wrenching family drama on the order of A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN or TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. Later on in the film, the whole notion of Gamera-as-friend-of-the-children is taken to a ridiculous, groan-inducing extreme involving some kind of massive relay race of random kids, each running counter to rampaging crowds fleeing Nagoya and each in turn trying to get a needed power crystal to Gamera, who'd been rammed into an upper floor of an office tower (in a disturbing echo of 9/11) by the invading monster, Zedus.

Aside from all that, two things really irked me about this movie. First, we follow Toru, the boy who finds the turtle egg that hatches baby Gamera, as he raises it in secrecy from baby turtle to practically man-size in a matter of days, but we never see him feed his new pet. What did it eat? How did it grow so big? This crucial omission seriously undermined the film's first section for me. I could have forgiven that, but after Gamera has grown big enough to be played by a man in a monster suit, he looks really silly and cartoonish, like the Pillsbury Dough Boy, and nothing like the fierce Gamera of old. His trademark fangs are even shortened and blunted. It's as if they made a new Godzilla movie by taking Minya, the pudgy, harmless ""Son of Godzilla"" featured in SON OF GODZILLA, DESTROY ALL MONSTERS, and GODZILLA'S REVENGE, and made HIM Godzilla in the next movie. I don't think fans would have been very pleased. The sad thing about all this is that Gamera's monster opponent here, Zedus, a giant, bipedal iguana-type creature, is actually quite formidable and well-designed and the brief scenes of monster combat in the streets of Nagoya are exciting and beautifully staged. They just belonged in a better kaiju movie.

For the record, the director here, Ryuta Tasaki, has worked on the Hollywood-based ""Power Rangers"" series, directing episodes of one of the all-time best Power Rangers seasons, ""Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue"" (2000).",1215561600,2,2545,4.848275862068966

It played as you would expect a new, opened disc.  There are Japanese and English choices for the main track as well as subtitles.  I enjoyed the extra features, which include various trailers.  I wouldn't expect to spend $25 for a DVD this long in release, but I think it was worth it.",1516665600,4,447,4.273809523809524

8189027,4,B000P5HARG,"A good and enjoyable Gamera film, not the best, but definitely worth watching. The story picks up right after the 3rd film (Revenge of Iris) with Gamera overwhelmed by hordes of Gaos and eventually sacrificing himself to save everyone. Some years later a young boy discovers a baby Gamera, reborn, and growing rapidly.

The film itself is a nice entry into the series, and as of now very hard to obtain via traditional methods of shopping. If you are a Gamera fan like myself, or just looking for a giant monster flick, you will enjoy every minute of this movie.",1443139200,,562,4.62
