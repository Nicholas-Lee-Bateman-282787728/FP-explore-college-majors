903978,5,6304633890,"I was curious to see ""Man With the Movie Camera"" ever since reading 'Kino-Eye', the director's rather bombastic manifesto about the virtues of nonfiction film making.  Soon after the DVD was released, I ordered it online. I was not at all disappointed upon satisfaction of my curiosity.

The film is all montage, not story or lecturing, and makes a fetish of modernization and industrialization.  It derives its power from the pure artistry of editing, from the rapid justaposition of images and of snippets of action from everyday life.

There's something about the total effect of Dziga Vertov's film, its zestful ""sense of life"", its manic energy, that may especially (and very surprisingly) appeal to fans of Ayn Rand, the anti-Soviet novelist who left the USSR for the USA during the mid-1920s and who went on to eventually write Atlas Shrugged.

It's interesting that Vertov is considered one of the trailblazers of cinema verite, the recording of the quotidian as-it-happens, whereas his film is actually a collage of kinetic images symphonically woven into an architechtonic whole of visual and spirtual unity.  A product of organizing intellect, not mere assemblage, his documentary does not so much 'document' as utterly transform -- it is not so much true-to-life as true-to-vision.",1057363200,9,1293,5.222222222222222
903979,4,6304633890,Please note that this film is in the public domain and available on DVD from different companies.  The Kino version does not contain the audio essay referred to in some of the reviews.  The only extras on the Kino version are some short biogaphies about people involved in making the film.  It's worth noting that the film has some scenes of topless women at a beach and also a somewhat graphic birth scene which some viewers may find objectionable.,1053129600,9,449,4.658227848101266
903980,5,6304633890,"Wertov's movie could be described as a highly observant portrayal of the move from traditional society (horses, buggies, etc) to the machine age - automobiles, factory machines, trains etc.  Done with no dialog, but to his own choice of music, this is exquisite photography of a day in the life of Soviet Russia in 1928, prior to Stalin.  It shows a much more free enterprise society than we might have expected, but which was killed by Stalin.
The 'Man with the Movie Camera' is an epic of early cinema, and is really not to be missed.",1049760000,2,536,4.572916666666667
903981,5,6304633890,"Dziga Vertov's _Man With a Movie Camera_ stretches the Soviet theories of montage to the breaking point.  Like most Stalin-era films, it appears propagandistic at first glance.  But in its relentless exposure of the cinematic phenomenon, the film compels viewers to think for themselves, and reconsider what they see on the screen.  It's clear that Vertov thought himself a good Communist for attempting to make his audience more self-aware, but Stalin's apparatchiks loudly disagreed; after all, nothing was more dangerous for them than a free-thinking proletariat.  In addition, the film shows just enough of Soviet urban squalor to give the lie to official visions of a workers' paradise.
With the support of the George Eastman House, video preservation guru David Shepard has restored Vertov's documentary-manifesto with loving care, even insisting on a 1.20:1 aspect ratio (which is slightly narrower than the average television set, hence a small black bar on the side of the screen).  The musical score, by the Alloy Orchestra, follows Vertov's surprisingly detailed instructions to the letter.
What really makes this edition impressive is its sole special feature: an audio essay by Yuri Tsivian that may be the best DVD commentary I've ever heard.  We need more commentaries like this one, with true film scholars explaining the images in terms which are neither too technical nor too vague.  A must-own.",1047859200,9,1413,5.309417040358745
903982,5,6304633890,"Vertov's _Man with a Movie Camera_ is not only the hallmark of Russian Constructivist film but one of the greatest films ever made, no hyperbole intended. Vertov's main premise was to create a new city, an Utopian ideal,  through montage and editing. The scenes in the film are taken from footage  of the three Russian cities of Kiev, Moscow and Odessa.
Unlike many of  the other reviewers, I would have to suggest watching the film with the  sound off (at least once.) The music, although originally composed by  Vertov, has been adapted more recently by the Alloy Orchestra, and can have  the tendency to be a distraction. Indeed, Vertov stated that film should be  a medium that stands alone, not muddled by the addition of psychology,  romance, or music. He placed tremendous value on the camera's ability to  distill truth from visual ""garbage,"" with what he termed  ""Kino-Eye"" or ""Truth-Eye.""
Additionally, I would  recommend reading Vlada Petric's meticulous still-by-still dissection of  the film---_Constructivism in Film : The Man With the Movie Camera : A  Cinematic Analysis (Cambridge Studies in Film)_, as well as Andrei Bely's  novel _Petersburg_, which Nabokov cited as one of the four most important  literary works of the 20th century and deals in part with a similar urban  improvement motif, and of course Vertov's own theoretical writings  _Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov_.",960940800,107,1402,5.132743362831858
903983,5,6304633890,"I love silent movies. The grammar of the cinema has been invented during this period. It's amazing to discover that what seems to us truly original or personal in most of our today geniuses was already there in these black  and white movies, even in a better way. I am conscious that it demands a  peculiar effort to the 1999 movie fan, but the reward is great.
THE MAN  WITH A MOVIE CAMERA is a 1929 russian movie directed by Dziga Vertov. A  breath-taking musical score has been recorded for the reissue of this movie  a few years ago. I still have this music in my head three days after having  seen the picture ! You will also find in this DVD a really instructive  commentary which is absolutely necessary if you want to appreciate all the  subtleties of THE MAN OF THE MOVIE CAMERA.
This motion picture is a kind  of manifesto, without screenplay. It could have been a documentary but it's  not. Certain moments are not so far from the surrealism one can find in the  movies of Luis Bunuel shot at the same period. Other scenes of the movie  are lessons of cinema that could have been given by, let's say, a Jean-Luc  Godard. For instance, Vertov films a train coming with great speed towards  the camera, then the man with the movie camera shooting the scene, then the  audience watching the train coming on the screen. At this moment, one  remembers that one of the first movies ever filmed was, in 1896, the  entrance of a train in a french railway station. The audience screamed and  left the room in a hurry, 35 years later no one moves.
If you are curious  about cinema, if you definitely consider it as an art, if you like to have  images haunting your mind during days, then you really should consider THE  MAN WITH A MOVIE CAMERA as
A DVD for your library.",955929600,61,1771,4.404320987654321

This movie is a dawn-to-dusk look at 1920's Oddessa.  Made wholly by two cameramen,  ""Man"" blurs the distinction between camera and eye by using a  fast-paced editing process that harkens of a blinking eye; from the bedroom  of an imminent mother to a beach on the Black Sea, to the depths a ore  mine, this is a wonderfull testament of film making.  Along with this,  there runs an original score written by Vertov himself in 1925, and is the  direct link to composers like Steve Reich and Phillip Glass.  The score has  many different themes and actually carries the movie at times.  Vertov, in  1925-1929, created a work of art which has slipped through the cracks, but,  recently, has been getting more well known.

903986,4,6304633890,"The filmic space of Man With a Movie Camera creates manifold dimensions of perception.  By framing the film as not only a production of film itself but the viewing of it Vertov establishes a context of moving barriers  between what is real and what is portrayed.  His passion for the modernized  world of mechanization and city construction is seen in the city symphony  sort of document, the way he edited  manipulating time and multiple-spaces,  as well as the portrayal of the camera itself as a figure having an  ontological role.  Throughout the film there is the explicit scenes of  the cinema, posters to screenings, people in theatres, projections of the  footage scene at that secondary level.  Along with scenes of  the editing  process these ""cross-sections"" of flimmaking reveal some of the constructs  to film's illusion.  At the same time, it also obscures the lines defining  reality and representation.  Vertov's seeming infatuation with  technology and industrialization is more of a celebration than that found  in October, Eisenstein seems to have premonition of modernization's terror  or dominance.  His shots of city are echoed by energetic, fluid music.  His  edits that sometime incorporate divided images lauds the flux of urban  activity.  Machines are scene to improve the physique of humans.

904083,5,6304633890,"If you think cinema can and should do more than simply tell stories in traditional character-driven narratives, then Dziga Vertovs sublime 1929 avant-garde debut silent feature Man with a Movie Camera is manna from Heaven. Voted No. 8 in Sight & Sounds 2012 list of 10 greatest ever films and misleadingly pronounced in 2014 by the same source, the best documentary (though firmly refuting fictional narrative cinema it certainly isn't a documentary in the strictest sense), the film packs a huge reputation which this splendid BFI release firmly justifies. To be clear, I am reviewing the 2008 DVD which comes with no extras aside from useful biographies of the personnel involved. It does come with a wonderful score by the second generation minimalist composer Michael Nyman. Potential buyers should note that BFI have re-released this remastered and restored print (original aspect ratio: 1.33:1) on Blu-ray with 3 other Vertov films as well as a commentary track on the main feature. But before rushing off to buy that we should note Masters of Cinema have announced yet another version due to be released later this year. That will also contain the extra films and is said to come from an original negative superior to the one BFI offer here. As marvelous as this DVD is I should point out that there are numerous scratches resulting from obvious wear and tear. With their superb reputation for restoring silent features (look at the splendid job they have done on F. W. Murnau and Fritz Lang!) the MoC version looks certain to supersede BFI as No. 1 choice, but whether or not it comes with the Nyman score is for the moment uncertain. If it doesnt then it looks like well have to make room on our shelves for two versions! Laying my cards on the table, for me Nymans score is the best silent film soundtrack I have ever heard. It matches the film quite brilliantly from start to finish and is good enough to stand on its own without the images. I am reminded of Philip Glass soundtracks for Godfrey Reggios Qatsi Trilogy, but the quality of those films cannot compare with the magnificence of Man with a Movie Camera. Where Reggio piddles around on the surface making very obvious statements on what sadness humanity is inflicting on the planet, Vertov crafts a highly sophisticated text which amounts to quite simply the best film about film-making ever made.

To understand this film we should pay attention to the artistic movement its creators were caught up in and their aims as clearly stated as an epitaph before the film begins. Dziga Vertov (real name Denis Arkadievitch Kaufman and whose pseudonym means spinning top), Mikhail Kaufman (Vertovs brother and cameraman/main protagonist of the film) and Elizaveta Svilova (Vertovs wife and editor who also appears during the film) were all members of the avant-garde Kino-Oki group which between 1922 and 1925 made 23 issues of Kino-Pravda (Cinema-Truth) in which Vertov attempted to push documentary towards Expressionism. They circulated poisonous manifestoes labeling traditional narrative cinema impotent and technically retrograde, their makers junk dealers. Making narrative cinema is dismissed as studying your own arse as the Kino-Oks set about capturing everyday life in so called fragments of actuality. Vertov joined Mayakovskys LEF (Left Front) group of intellectuals which also included Rodchenko, Pasternak, Meyerhold and Eisenstein. In their 1923 Kin-Oks-Revolution manifesto appears the following statement: I am a mechanical eye. I am a machine, am showing you a world, the likes of which only I seeI co-ordinate any and all points of the universe wherever I may plot them. In films like Kino-Eye (1924), Stride Forward Soviet! (1926) and Eleventh Hour (1928) the camera aggressively asserts its God-like dominance to establish a dialectic between objectivity and subjectivity which assumes center stage in Man with a Movie Camera.

The film announces itself as A fragment from the life of a cameraman in which its key creator is the conductor of an experiment which aims to abolish all non-documentary styles of film-making. The opening epitaph reads: The film Man with a Movie Camera represents an experimentation in the cinematic communication of visual phenomena without the use of intertitles (a film without intertitles), without the help of a scenario (a film without a scenario), without the help of theatre (a film without actors, without sets, etc). This new experimentation work of Kino-Eye is directed towards the creation of an authentically absolute language of cinema  Absolute kinography  on the basis of its complete separation from the language of theatre and literature. As we shall see this epitaph proves disingenuous for fictional representation (the staging of many scenes) and theatrical presentation (the film begins with its audience taking their seats in the movie theatre) remain important parts of the final result. Impossible to categorize, the film certainly avoids traditional fictional construction, but the final result is more visual poem than documentary.

The subject of the experiment is a day in the life of urban Russia c. 1926-28. Shot over 3 years in 4 different cities (Moscow, Kiev, Odessa and Karkhov) it assumes the form of a dawn to dusk city symphony. This wasn't a new phenomenon, part inspired as it was by films such as Rien que les heures (Alberto Cavalcanti), Berlin - Der Sinfonie der Grostadt (1927, Walter Ruttmann) and Mikhail Kaufmans own Moscow (1926). It does however invert the convention by setting the film in several cities and by organizing its montage of urban imagery along carefully arranged themes which operate on several layers of narrative perception. On one level it satisfies its official propaganda remit by working through the prevailing Marxist ideology. The film establishes a city of the future while commenting on existing ideals in the Soviet world. Watching it, the Soviet citizen is supposed to be awakened by truth to bring about action through the films portrayal of electrification, industrialization and the achievements of workers through hard labor. Those antipathetic to propaganda need not worry however for the film isn't as jarringly simplistic as Battleship Potemkin (1924, Sergei Eisenstein) or other crasser examples of the genre. The films multi-layered narrative structure ensures a sophistication mere propaganda can never approach.

The film is centrally about perception, how we watch a film, how the film reflects or determines reality, and how reality reflects or determines the film. There are four main layers of perception  the first is the obvious one of us sitting in the audience watching a film. We sit aware of the reality that surrounds us and are confronted by another reality on a screen which we interact with. The second is that of the audience inside the film in turn watching the very film we are watching and which is also in the process of being made. In the superbly orchestrated opening the audience takes its seat to watch another reality play out on the screen in front of them. The third layer of perception is that of the film being assembled in front of our/their eyes by its very creators. The first person we see is the cameraman climbing on top of a huge camera in a split screen image. He disappears behind a curtain to assume the double role of cameraman and projectionist as he starts the film. Throughout the film we see the cameraman assume the hero role as he shoots what we see and captures himself in the process. Later we are shown the films editor putting the film together and as the film accelerates towards its dizzying conclusion we are made ever more aware of the fourth layer of perception  that mechanical eye directing everything with its auteur directorial voice determining everything we see and how it is presented. This perception inverts the usual idea of the camera capturing or reflecting reality towards the idea that without the camera there would be no reality at all. The camera determines the reality as much as reality determines what the camera captures. And how much do we or the audience in the film determine our/their own sense of reality? Repeatedly throughout the film the camera is shown (through double exposure) to be a giant eye which belongs to each individual perception. Everything is shown to be both objective and subjective at the same time to achieve a truly stunning synthesis of everything involved in watching a film and indeed the wider world which surrounds it.

This is a film that withstands (begs for?) repeated viewings and its amazing how ones perception of it changes with each visit. When I first saw it at the NFT many years ago with a live piano accompaniment it seemed to be a simple (if chaotic) celebration of the possibilities of what a man with a movie camera (or an editor with a pair of scissors) can do as Vertov throws everything at us bar the kitchen sink. Double exposures, fast motion, slow motion, freeze frames, Dutch angles, extreme close-ups, tracking shots, footage played in reverse, even slow motion animation  all is thrown out with reckless abandon in 1,775 separate shots spliced together at X4 the speed of the average 1929 feature. On closer inspection we appreciate the material has been carefully arranged according to theme and bedded within an over-riding narrative structure which, in addition to taking on board multi-layered perceptions, has the musical symphony as its template. The film is not in 3 or 4 clearly defined classical movements  la Murnaus Nosferatu (1922) or Sunrise (1927). Rather, it is cast as a single movement symphony with fast-slow, funny-serious, tragic-comic gear changes in the texture which balances out miraculously to achieve a hugely satisfying whole. It is perhaps dangerous to read the film through one musical score (after all, Wikipedia lists over 20 alternative soundtracks!), but Nyman succeeds in highlighting the various sections of this single movement with astonishing sensitivity. Im not going to bore you with a shot-by-shot analysis  the fun surely lies in each viewer bringing their own perceptions to the table, but I will go through the film drawing attention to a few things that especially are brought out by the soundtrack.

Repeated viewings reveal 8 distinct sections in the films 68 minute city journey from dawn to dusk. I have already touched on the introduction with the cameraman appearing on a giant camera before slipping behind a curtain to start his/our film. This takes place in complete silence and highlights his central importance as main character and determinator of everything we will see. Nymans strident opening music starts as we are taken into the movie theatre and see the rows of empty seats which are quickly filled as the audience files in. The sense of theatre here is unmistakable with the anticipation heightened further by members of the orchestra assuming their positions in the pit (unnaturally it seems as if every instrument is poised to play at the same time!) as the cameraman/projectionist sets his camera/projector in motion. Nymans energetic and grandiose opening segues into a gentle rocking lullaby as we move into the second section as the film within a film settles on a series of languid images of a city asleep at dawn. At first we are shown empty spaces  streets and squares, buildings, shuttered shops, restaurants and cafs intercut with a woman sleeping in her bed. These are all locations we will revisit later when the city is in full motion. This section grows in poignancy the more times you see the film, a feeling fully reflected in Nymans simple scoring. Gradually people are introduced, shown sleeping and then awakening. There are people sleeping rough on the ground and on benches. Especially theres the woman in her room depicted at first in extreme close-up sleeping, and then in the third section, getting up, washing and dressing. This is intercut with other tranquil images, among them a poster advertising a film called The Awakening Woman (the name of the feature the audience in the film are watching? An ironic comment? Mother Russia awakening?). This is perhaps the most obvious non-documentary scene of the film, the (uncredited) woman obviously posing at length for Vertov. The artificiality is heightened further with a series of rapid cuts from the woman blinking herself awake to the venetian blinds which eventually let in light from her window. The idea of the camera as an eye and the objective (we see the woman) and the subjective (we see her view of the blind) is firmly established right here.

In this third section the entrance of the cameraman in the main text of the film he is making is underlined by another change in Nymans score. From sleepy lullaby we move to a slightly upbeat tempo as a note of theatrical anticipation reappears. It is clear that the film only really begins when the cameraman begins to shoot, waking everyone up and literally turning the city on. Positioning his camera on a tripod in a car he journeys around the city making preparations for future shots and while doing so Vertov introduces the machines that run the city from the cameramans car to trains (a hole is dug under a rail track in preparation for a shot from under a passing train), to planes and buses and most of all to the trolley cars which will dominate the film from here right through to the conclusion. The feeling is that these different modes of transportation are set in motion by the cameraman. Without him there to capture them it is as if they don't exist. As a row of trolley cars appear from their shed Nymans music breaks into full pelt as suddenly the city lurches into full motion as people commute to work. Rapid and extremely humorous cross-cutting is the hallmark of this teeming fourth section showing not only modes of transportation but also machines in various factories in full motion. Vertov distinguishes between the cold mechanization of the machines that run the city and the warmth and humanity of the people operating them. Nyman recognizes this and in the fifth section the rhythmic pulse of the music mellows (and is capped by a beautiful soprano vocalise) as we are shown images of people swarming the streets in crowds, pushing through dock gates to board a ship and going about their everyday business in the city. City services are stressed with a couple registering their marriage at City Hall immediately followed by another couple registering their divorce as two trolley cars go in opposite directions to witty effect. A woman shielding her face from identity with her handbag is juxtaposed with a woman shielding her face in grief mourning the loss of a loved one. An image of childbirth is matched with the image of a corpse in a funeral cortge, the tragedy of an accident in a coal mine is countered with an image of resilient stoicism as the emergency services (an ambulance and a fire engine driving in tandem) rush to the rescue. It is in this section that Vertov inserts a lesson in editing as he shoots a troika moving down the street with freeze frames juxtaposed with images of his wife at the editing table splicing frames together. Reaction shots of children and crowds on a street are all frozen and then re-started as we see the film literally being put together shot by shot. Throughout the busy and increasingly frenzied montage we see the cameraman and how he achieves many of his shots. Coal miners push their carts over the camera is followed by a high shot of the same miners walking over the cameraman lying prostrate on the ground cranking his machine. If the camera isn't brazenly in the camera frame we sense the presence of the cameraman through reflections, shadows and reactions of people. One woman wakes up, realizes she is being filmed and huffs off angrily while a man wakes up, smiles and bathes in his sudden celebrity. During this long central fifth section Nyman plays with tempi and mood. Mechanical activity is rendered fast and upbeat while people are depicted slowly and tenderly. The gear changes in the soundtrack perfectly match those in Vertovs text. The meta-cinematic subtext continues in tandem throughout. Towards the end of this section Vertov inserts a short sequence whose title could be the dangers of film-making. The cameraman takes center stage in front of the camera as he is placed in various precarious positions  perilously close to the furnace of a steelworks, dangling from a wire high above an awesome weir of a hydro-electric dam and squished between two trolley cars passing in opposite directions. The tone is jokey and Nyman deliberately allows the music to distort exactly at the moment people begin to tire and the day begins to wind down. The machines are turned off and the film (and the music) makes an abrupt transition to images of the people of the city at play which makes up the films sixth section. The film is only loosely presented as a day in the life of a city as this break is hardly realistic. We are in effect given a working day spliced together with a holiday as we stop work and go to the beach. The cameraman still carrying his tripod and camera is in shorts now as he too lolls in the water and bathes. Swimming is matched with a long montage of many other sports (much of it in slow motion) as the camera celebrates the Soviet citizen enjoying life in their wonderful mechanized world. The most obviously propagandistic we get is a woman on a shooting range shooting the target of a man bearing a swastika with the title the origin of fascism proclaimed below. This is interesting being still 5 years before the rise of Hitler in Germany.

The seventh section acts as a transition from play back to the workings of the city as Vertov at first takes us to various theatres and the very movie theatre and audience we saw at the beginning. The tone is comic here as the camera sans cameraman is animated onto its tripod to take a bow for its efforts. The audience laughs before watching abstract electronic noise fizz on their screen in one particularly surreal image. From the theatre it is a natural step into the films concluding eighth section as the workers finish their day. Workers returning home are juxtaposed with images of nightlife  drinking, dancing, clubbing, piano playing  all spliced together with dazzling pace and skill. A typewriter is transposed over a piano keyboard and a telephone exchange in a treble exposure, the cameraman appears as a midget standing in a tall glass of beer, the same dancer dances in 3 different places of a single shot with a piano bottom right of frame. Dutch angles splice streets and buildings in converging halves as a clock pendulum swings frantically and motion is fast-forwarded to achieve a dizzying dazzling riot of activity. The meanings and innuendo are numerous as Vertov playfully revels in a frenetic montage of everything we have seen, the cameraman and the editor taking their places as arch creators and behind them Vertov, the mechanical eye playing God in his disciplined critique of the objective/subjective viewing experience. A dazzling display, the film is a celebration of Soviet Russia in the late 20s, a celebration of Man and what he can do, a celebration of image making and what a man with a movie camera can achieve, and an avant-garde challenge to the status quo which no other film maker since has ever quite risen to.

Dreyer's movie excels through its camera movements and focal changes of lenses, D. Vertov's film shines through its shooting angles and, most importantly, through its editing with one image shots, split screens and a beautifully flowing movement throughout the whole film, based on inside screen motions, the transitions and the links between the scenes and a splendid timing.
If its techniques didn't influence directly major filmmakers, D. Vertov was at least their predecessor. One thinks immediately of Alain Resnais and Leni Riefenstahl.
Dziga Vertov was perhaps himself inspired by Fritz Lang's Metropolis.

Regarding the content, Dziga Vertov's movie is also groundbreaking. It is not only a movie in a movie, for there is a third level: D. Vertov adds the projection of his own movie in his movie! It is also the first movie which records the birth of a human being.
Moreover, D. Vertov edited his shots with juxtapositions, like wedding/divorce scenes or the change of left/right directions inside the screen.

Vertov doesn't simply record ""the modern"" (as so many early silent films do), rather he constructs a very selective view of ""the modern"" that also functions as critique. Through Vertov's lens, the modern looks like a set of practices that reduce the working class to a fixed set of dehumanizing rites and rituals. Even the ""man with the camera,"" who Vertov tracks throughout the film,  looks like just another worker caught up in the hectic hustle and bustle with no time for reflection, but ""reflect"" is what we're invited to do when Vertov himself turns away from the crowds and films a mannequin riding a bicycle in a store window.  Benjamin worried that film would be used as just another tool to engineer the masses (and he was probably right), but this rare use of film as visual essay (rare in its day and even rarer in ours) no doubt inspired Bresson and Godard and those select few filmmakers who keep an eye on the engineers.",1344297600,,1046,4.648648648648648
904400,5,6304633890,"A short but great film from the Soviet Union in the late 20s of last century at the time of the new silent film technology. It is worth watching a couple of times to check the technology itself and particularly the special effects that were developed and used at the time. The new camera enabled the film maker to have a wide picture and thus to have crowd scenes but editing provided new possibilities. And Vertov used them widely.

But the film is a lot more interesting as for its content and meaning. He has to be compared with Eisenstein who favored direct political messages, particularly about recent Soviet history. But we must not forget Fritz Lang who favored in his Metropolis another political message that industrialism was developing exploitation and enslavement and that it was barbarous and inhumane. But at the same time it is from these workers and the working class that hope could come from in the form of a rebellion and a compromise.

Vertov, apart from using the name and likeness of Lenin a couple of times is not only providing us with a political message. Of course it means that in the new historical phase the Soviet Union is going through Lenin, hence the revolution he represents (in his absence now), brought free time, leisure time, vacations to the workers themselves. But this message is the smaller part of the meaning. In fact paid vacations were invented by the Soviet Union, then adopted by Hitler and finally by the French in 1936. It spread from these three sources later on.

What is essential is the extremely positive vision of industrialism. The society it builds is a society of speed, ease, and creative work. Speed because everything is organized to save time and energy, to make things faster. Vertov concentrates on city life and does not really consider agriculture. This fast society is represented particularly by trams and means of transportation, but also at work by the new work organization that we call in the west taylorism or fordism. Charlie Chaplin will make fun of it in the most caustic way in his Modern Times.

Ease is also represented by modern means of transportation but also in life in general due to the new organization of industrial work that liberates free time, and the development of stores and commodities. Creative work is a positive vision of industrial work: workers are creative by being workers. It means that they create added value and riches for the whole country by and with their work. This is the most important message there and it is of course deeply political but it is also in complete contrast with the ideologists and artists of the west like Fritz Lang, H.G. Wells, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell or even T.S. Eliot.

Vertov is an optimist. This vision is of course today difficult to accept because that fully accepted industrialism produced pollution, colonialism, totalitarianism, fascism, nazism, and many other delicate development of the 20th century. Note I do not mention communism which is covered by totalitarianism. Paid vacations and the 40 working hours a week are two positive reforms that do not in any way cover up the rest nor compensate for the rest.

A last remark is that this film gives us a completely exploded vision of life in a myriad of small tid-bits that are recomposed in the kaleidoscope of our eyes. We find the same vision in Russian music at the same time. Fast rhythm of innumerable particles of life similar to the vision we can have of a very busy street while we are on a fast errand that makes us go up that street in little time. In other words the new technology made it possible to show on a screen what exploded life was really becoming. Vertov shows the positive side of things. Go to Fritz Lang or Charlie Chaplin to have the negative side of things, even if Chaplin tries to see the fun of it.

904404,5,6304633890,"Even if Soviet Russian Avant Garde is your least favourite genre, chances are that ""Man With the Movie Camera"" will still leave a deep and permanent impression on your mind and compel you to watch it more than once.  Unlike other famous Russian films of the late silent era such as Eisenstein's ""The Battleship Potemkin"" and Pudovkin's ""The Fall of St Petersburg"", the director of this film, Dziga Vertov, took an even more revolutionary step away from mainstream commercial cinema, and even fiercely resisted the narrative film, meaning the staged, theatrical, planned movie with a story and actors.  This outlook on art and cinema led to Vertov developing the concepts of capturing ""life unawares"" and ""life as it is"" with the movie camera to create a unique experience in film documentary which is at the same time an impressive work of art.

While the word `art' usually conjures up images of beauty, style, grace and elegance, the viewer's first impression of ""Man With the Movie Camera"" is anything but beautiful, as images of city streets and people waking to a new day and getting ready for work bombard our visual senses.  But before long it is obvious that there is a distinct rhythm, and what seem like random images taken from moments out of everyday life are put together - like a musical composition - to create a perfectly choreographed work of great artistic skill.  Even if the viewer has no interest in the artistic aspects, the bombardment of images using the whole wide range of editing and camera techniques known at the time becomes quite mesmerizing and fascinating.  Images of streets in Russian cities like Moscow, Kiev and Odessa show transportation from trains, trams, horse carriages, ambulance and fire engines, then people going to work in coal mines, fields and in the city, using modern technology of the time such as the telephone, switchboard and typewriter; people going to a wedding, a funeral, having a baby, being pampered in a beauty salon, then enjoying recreation after work such as going to the beach, dancing and playing sports and games.  Every aspect of life is touched on, and it never becomes boring because the tempo changes frequently, or we see the cameraman himself, who was Vertov's brother, seeking the best position to film, then there are close-ups, unusual angles, frozen frames, montages and other effects to keep the viewer under a spell.

This Image DVD has a musical score by the Alloy Orchestra, based on instructions by Vertov himself because in a visual work of art like this, the music should underscore and complement the images as best as possible.  The Alloy Orchestra has achieved this goal brilliantly, and there is also an optional audio commentary to provide more insight into Vertov's ideas, as well as various background information which help the viewer appreciate the film on a deeper level.

Vertov resisted the notion of telling a story like all his contemporaries, but he ended up telling a much more profound and important story than all other filmmakers, namely the story of life, told in the universal language of pictures, of cinema, which requires no words and no speech.  This is perhaps what makes this film special and unique, and transcends any label one might like to give it, whether Soviet Avant Garde, Silent or documentary.

I love the brilliant visual optical effects and I love how it presents a reflective post-modern experience of the technology and act of filmmaking itself.  It can be intense and exhilirating, then funny and playful, then dramatic and emotional.

904406,5,6304633890,"If nothing, this DVD is a proof that every modern editing technique is based on Soviet revolutionary silents, done almost 90 years ago.
Dziga Vertov - aka Deniz Kaufman - invented the whole new narrative form based on impulsive editing,rapid-fire cross-cutting, juhstapositioning simple shots to create methaphores and litotes and inject conotations into everyday`s images. Like many of the Soviet movies of the day, this film had an objective to prove that `revolutionary` cinema does not need clasic conventions, and maybe because of that it has fresh, independent, experimental breath and a lot of guts.
Vertov, at the age of 19, was promoted to became the chief editor for Soviet
agit-prop movies, position which he also used to experiment with form.
Dealing mostly with documentary footage, he managed to make it ""alive"", ""exciting"" and ""agressive"", spending months and months in his cutting room full of rats and dripping water. The results are two master-peaces which he made in 1920.tees:
""Kino -Eye"" and ""The Man With the Movie Camera"" -  both milestones in the movie history.

Dziga Vertov invents, deploys or develops techniques such as double exposure, fast motion, slow motion, freeze frames, jump cuts, split screens, Dutch angles, extreme close-ups, tracking shots, footage played backwards, animations and a self-reflexive style.

His message was simple and concise.  The camera could go anywhere and do anything.  It's almost as if Vertov could see the future.  At the time, camera's where big and loud and could not be hidden but Vertov could see that it for what it was.",1227139200,3,780,4.768656716417911
904520,5,6304633890,"The late 1920's were no doubt a strange time for most citizens of the Soviet Union. They were adapting to a new form of government after centuries of czarist rule, the entire world was on the precipice of an economic downturn and the whole nation had to get used to calling St. Petersburg `Leningrad.'

Dziga Vertov's 1929 film The Man with a Movie Camera captures all of this turbulence, change and optimism in a montage of images that are at once random and perfectly connected. Much like the movie itself, individual opinions will feature a dichotomy of views. Some people will find the movie boring while others will find it engrossing. Some will claim that there was no point to the movie and others will claim that the absence of a point was the whole point itself. Most, however, will come away from this film thinking all of these things at once.

The complete lack of a storyline or clear point allows Vertov to use editing extensively in conveying his message. While it's uncertain exactly what that message is, tempo changes and scene placement precisely convey an overall feeling of change. Russia in 1929 was in as much a state of flux as possible, whether it be economically, politically, technologically, religiously or culturally. No one really knew what the end result would be, though they had theories, and this is exactly what Vertov conveys in his film. Industry was stressed extensively in Russia during this period. They had lagged behind the Western world following the Industrial Revolution, so the new Communist government instituted a strategy to catch up. Through the use of new machinery they could farm more efficiently and produce in greater numbers. These processes are highlighted in Vertov's film. He painted them in an optimistic light, though the overall fury of the film made it all seem overwhelming even to me, 70+ years later.",1224115200,,1866,4.901898734177215

Man with a Movie Camera, sometimes The Man with the Movie Camera, The Man with a Camera, The Man With the Kinocamera, or Living Russia is an experimental 1929 silent documentary film by Russian director Dziga Vertov.

Vertov's feature film, produced by the Ukrainian film studio VUFKU, presents urban life in Odessa and other Soviet cities. From dawn to dusk Soviet citizens are shown at work and at play, and interacting with the machinery of modern life. To the extent that it can be said to have ""characters,"" they are the cameraman of the title and the modern Soviet Union he discovers and presents in the film.

This film is famous for the range of cinematic techniques Vertov invents, deploys or develops, such as double exposure, fast motion, slow motion, freeze frames, jump cuts, split screens, Dutch angles, extreme close-ups, tracking shots, footage played backwards, animations and a self-reflexive style (at one point it features a split screen tracking shot; the sides have opposite Dutch angles).

The idea is to essentially provide viewers with a slice of life as it existed at the time in The Soviet Union. The Man With The Movie Camera uses fantastic camera and cinematography techniques to make this movie stand out as a very good one.

This slice of life movie runs a full 68 minutes without any intertitles, plot, or actors. The people we see in the film are real, everyday people of different classes and backgrounds. I know; the former Soviet Union was to be a classless society; but it's abundantly clear in this movie that some people were so poor they had to sleep in the streets while others clearly enjoyed life at the beach or very modern clothing for their outings and social gatherings. In addition, we see the effects of Communism in the various social halls and a passenger freighter all named after Lenin. The newspaper is a union run newspaper; and except for the wealthy most people do wear essentially the same style of clothing.

The film brilliantly starts with a movie theater filling up with moviegoers and the projectionist and orchestra pit begin the performance; thus there is a movie within a movie. Very impressive! The footage also includes quite a bit of time filming the director as he goes all over a city, towns and beaches trying and succeeding at capturing this precious slice of life.

We see happy people, sad and depressed people, storekeepers, mail carriers. As the film goes along the day begins and we see the people of a city rise from their beds to start what becomes an incredibly busy day; and this is documented very well in this film.

Overall, I highly recommend this film for those of us interested in looking at the past and people who like sociology will also appreciate this movie. The musical score for this silent movie is also excellent. The only extra feature is a commentary; but I think the film stands quite well on its own.

The opening moments of the newly-restored edition of Dziga Vertov's most famous film, The Man with a Movie Camera, explain that the silent film contains no cards because Vertov was less interested in making a traditional movie than in creating a visual language. Thus, those who go into this looking for a traditional movie aren't going to get much out of it; there's no plot, no characters, no story, not much of anything, really. The idea behind Vertov's vision was to (a) document daily life in contemporary Russia, and (b) to use nothing but images to convey the ambient emotions. And in that respect, the film is a smashing success; if you allow it to simply wash over you, it's a wonderful piece of work.

Perhaps even more interesting than Vertov's attempt to create a visual language was the movie's sense of what is popularly called ""meta"" today; the documentary itself is framed with images of a movie theater where people are attending a screening of, you guessed it, The Man with a Movie Camera. If nothing else, these scenes alone-- unheard of at the time-- would cement Vertov's place as one of film's pioneers.

Its importance in the greater scheme of cinema would be hard to overstate; Vertov's little self-aware documentary was a direct influence on hundreds, if not thousands, of movies that followed (most importantly Triumph des Willens, which changed not only the face of filmmaking, but the face of the entire marketing industry as well). Eighty years later, The Man with a Movie Camera has as much power to impress as it did when it was released-- as long as you're willing to take it on its own terms. ****",1172534400,6,1680,4.7465753424657535
904528,5,6304633890,"THE MAN WITH THE MOVIE CAMERA is a film you're either going to love or hate, and it's unlikely you'll find a comfortable mid-ground. It's silent, Russian made, experimental.  It opens with a manifesto rejecting inter-title cards, and an affinity to or reliance on theater and literature.  It won't reject any of the tricks of cinema, though - including stop-action animation, slow motion, and at times dizzying, machine fire montages.  It uses documentary footage to tell its story.

 Although it doesn't tell a traditional story the movie does have a structure.  It opens in an empty movie hall, records a projectionist queuing up reel one.  Cuts to the hall, stop-action animates chairs unfolding.  Cuts to the orchestra - conductor's baton is raised, the orchestra is readied and suspended.  Enter audience.  Love it or hate it, this movie never forgets it's a movie.  I loved it.  And I loved when the projector started and the real movie started.

 And that journey - the one the movie takes - is well described by the second American title, `Living Russia.'  We seem to spend most of the movie following a man with an old, hand-cranked, tripod supported movie camera as he travels through some Russian city or other.  We, over his shoulder, seem to go everywhere and observe everything - a young woman sleeping in bed, people sleeping on park benches, store-front mannequins at rest.  Eventually the woman and bench sleepers awake, the mannequins are animated, and we travel in time through the work and recreational life of a city.  Then it's to the foundry, the cigarette packing plant, the beach, the volleyball court....

 Some people will find this art house movie terribly self-absorbed and its lack of a conventional narrative frustrating.  If you only like movies that throw a good story at you probably won't care much for this film.  If you're not sure give this one a try - beneath it's lack of `story' is a fascinating story written on celluloid, vibrant, wry, and witty.",1157846400,19,1989,4.892215568862276
904631,5,6304633890,"Dziga Vertov's film is an amazing and quite daring foray into the realm of experimental cinema (I say this with some reservations -- see below).  The viewer is quite literally transported to the Soviet Union of the past.  We witness love and loss, happiness and sadness, life and death.  We witness the beginning of a day and the end of a day, a wedding and a divorce, a birth and a funeral.  All the scenes are real -- the birth is a real birth, the funeral a real funeral, the divorce a real divorce.  Nationalistic and cultural boundaries begin to fade since the events depicted say more about human nature than they do about a particular people.

The music is quite inventive and amazing, especially when one considers that only three young men are performing it.  The editing is some of the most astonishing ever to come out of Soviet silent cinema.

That said, there is a somewhat irritating political message that comes forth -- that industrialization will solve the problems of humanity, that those who follow the Party line are the ones depicted as being sober and responsible.  So many people are shocked by Nazi propaganda films such as ""Triumph of the Will,"" -- I find it sad that more people are not troubled by Soviet era films which tout the beauty of Marxist-Leninism while ignoring the carnage and sometimes outright genocide (i.e. the Ukranians)carried out by the Soviets for over seventy years.  The fact of the matter is that Soviet Marxist-Leninism slaughtered millions of people and enslaved millions of others.  This is a troubling hunk of history that is difficult to ignore when watching this otherwise masterful work of filmmaking.",1147392000,10,1657,4.840425531914893
904632,2,6304633890,"I watched this movie after hearing how highly rated it was. VERY disappointing. Musical score over shots around Russia, or Europe. I couldn't tell since there was no story, no words (even subtitles). Just a guy with a movie camera recording everyday people in their daily lives.

The music was NOT good, certainly not great. Even movies like The Third Man (1949) had amazing music. Not here.

So you have video and music, with no plot. No words, even silent era subtitles like Chaplin-NOTHING. If the music and video can't keep you interested... Skip this.

There are great films from this era. This is not one of them.

904633,5,6304633890,Unlike many other movies focused on linear narratives Man with a Movie Camera is a movie truly dedicated to its medium.  This movie focuses on visuals.

904634,5,6304633890,"""This film presents a experiment in the cinematic communication of visible event, without the aid of inter-titles, without the aid of a scenario.""  Such explannatory opening titles are the only ones you will see in this 1929 Soviet-made silent film.  Thence begins the visual tour we are taken through by ""The Man with a Movie Camera"" as he literally takes us along for the ride as he chronciles the better part of a day's usual goings-on in an agglomeration of Soviet cities.  Hence the scene index on this DVD segments up this film with the aid of such chapters labeled: ""The beginning,"" ""Workday begins,"" ""Open for business,"" ""Still life in motion,"" Emergency,"" ""Coal, steel, silk & water,"" ""Workday ends,"" Exercise,"" ""Special effects,"" ""The pace increases,"" concluding with ""End credits.""  I've included the above to give you an idea how this film achieves what other reviewers herein have characterized it doing.  Images are literally thrown at you at various speeds by Vertov, the director.  ""Workday begins,"" for instance, is a montage of images---alternatively moving and stilled---of folks waking up, streets coming alive, trams embarking out of their depots; with shots of cash registers, typewriters, parked cars, phones & such all waiting to be put in motion.  Then the movie camera lens that just showed us a woman washing her face, itself occupies the screen.  Then we see this woman's eyes.  Then a window shutter.  Then a window.  Then the camera again.  Then window blinds.  Then the woman's eyes yet again. Then the blinds again, followed by the lens, etc.  We don't watch this film from afar, in short.  Rather, we become ""The Man with the Movie Camera"" ourselves, as if we were the one running across a threshold, between street trams, or up a bridge---as we see the actual camerman do in this film---before we ourselves get to take in the view of the camera lens from such vantage points.  In this manner the director is hoping to wake us up to life as it is; to see life as if our eyes are but camera lenses.  It's makes for an interesting viewpoint---pardon the pun---to say the least; and accounts for the fact that ""The Man with a Movie Camera"" merits inclusion among the best silent films ever made, if not of all films made, as well.  Sure, ""the factory of dreams"" as Hollywood was known in Soviet Russia, is an art form in of itself.  Less known is ""the factory of facts"" which this film purports to represent.  You wouldn't think that a 68 minute storyless silent film (albeit it with a captivating score) would be actually entertaining, but it is; even with multiple viewings!  I, for one, have watched it 3 times and---most likely, will do so some months hence again.  I hope I have been of some help herein & that I have piqued your interest in seeing this film.  (If so, do listen to the audio commentary on this DVD after your first viewing.) (05Jan) Cheers!",1112745600,9,2892,4.751503006012024

You'll be amazed at the sort of filming and editing techniques these guys (and girl) employ during that period of time-- especially in comparison to what American cinema was like at the time.",1106438400,6,399,5.333333333333333
904636,5,6304633890,"This film has been aptly compared to Berlin: Symphony of a City, but what has interested me most about it is its portrayal of cinema as a universally accessible art form.  While there are propagandistic moments -- celebrating the efficiency and lifestyle of the Soviet working class -- it easily transcends whatever purpose the authorities (or Vertov himself) may have had in allowing Vertov to film it.  You have to remember that this film was composed for an audience that may have seen films but were certainly not film literate -- not many of us are now -- which is to say they had not likely been aware of the process of making films, or reflected much on the nature of film.  What is so exciting about this film is that it presents both a portrait of a city, and of the life of its inhabitants, as well as a documentary (and self-reflexive) study of the art of filmmaking.  There is much to learn from this film about the different ways of thinking about film, and I often show it in my film classes for this purpose.

There is the idea of film as a recorder of objective fact, that is potentially present anywhere though always located somewhere, suggested by the images of the filmmaker as a kind of eye towering over the city, seeing both the whole and the parts.  There is also the idea of film as highly subjective, suggested in images that show the personal reaction of the filmmaker, and in images that show the personal dangers faced by the ""man with a movie camera"" in his effort to capture difficult shots.  We see, in these shots, that film is not simply a passive recorder of events that unfold independently of the filmmaker but is also involved in the creation of these events.  We see the editor, editing the very footage that we had just seen the filmmaker recording.  We see that the filmmaker can be a kind of poet, making use of visual metaphors to suggest ideas: a train relay that suggests the intercutting of various scenes by the editor, a window and an eye that suggest the camera.  We also see the capacity of the filmmaker to manipulate and create a new reality, when we observe animation (of the camera itself, seemingly taking on a life of its own without the cameraman), but we also see how this animation is achieved.  We are even shown the audience itself, and by implication are included in the very picture we are watching.  Some of these metaphors and ideas may seem heavy handed today, but that is only in my description of them.  When you actually watch them they fascinate.  The editing also is superb in this film -- always appropriate to the scene it is sometimes slow, and sometimes more rapid and kinetic than anything MTV produces.

All in all, I consider this an essential piece of cinema, well worth purchasing on DVD while it is still available.  I hope it remains in print forever, but have a hard time believing it will, which is why I just recently purchased a personal copy -- when it was already owned by my campus library.  (The picture on the DVD is quite fine, better than the VHS copy I have seen; the music that was re-created from notes left behind by Vertov is superb and fits the film quite nicely.)",1104105600,5,3163,4.51138353765324
904637,4,6304633890,"Dziga Vertov's Man With the Movie Camera (1929) is a narrative-free silent film plucked right from Stalinist Russia. In it, Vertov envisions a world as seen from the lens of a camera...marriages, divorces, deaths, accidents, transportation, daily work, sports, beach-going...everything is seen from the camera's eye view. The film is edited using a number of innovative techniques, and throughout the 68 minute assault on your visual sense, you as viewer basically BECOME the Man with the Movie Camera, but because we frequently see a man with a movie camera, it becomes multi-layered. We are the camera filming the filmer. Vertov believed that film would triumph as a medium free of the narratives of literature or the standards of the other arts, that it could be truly an exquisite tool of the proletariat. Interestingly, he was not given approval from the Stalinists who felt that his commitment to aesthetics went beyond his commitment to ideology.
One of Vertov's key themes is the comparison of human labor with machines. He wrote, """"I am kino-eye, I am mechanical eye, I, a machine, show you the world as only I can see it. My path leads to the creation of a fresh perception of the world I decipher in a new way a world unknown to you.""

904638,3,6304633890,"""Man with the Movie Camera"" is a technically audacious film which chronicles daily life in Russia in the 1920's.  Vertov's innovative use of rapid camera movement and split-second editing are often startling, at times dizzying to behold.
The images which Vertov juxtaposes are incongruous and entertaining.  In one frame you see a dog sitting on a sidewalk. In another, you view people huddled together going to work and then a close-up of someone brushing their teeth.  Many scenes feature machines, factories and buildings representing Russia's industrialization.  There is a sense of detachment and dehumanization conveyed in the starkness of the concrete and steel structures you see emerging over cities as Russia modernizes.
Vertov introduced new and exciting techniques to the craft of filmmaking.  Yet I found his use of these techniques excessive, self-indulgent, and distracting as if he were ""showing off"" his technical prowess instead of enhancing the story.  Also, his repetition of the same or similar images dulls their impact.

Starting in a movie theater with the audience preparing to view the film, Vertov's cameraman takes them on a whirlwind tour of Russian life, from daybreak and visions of people sleeping on the streets and benches, interspersed with a young woman lying in her comfortable bed, to the everyday people working in the mines and factories.
It's a fascinating way to show the usage of the camera as a tool to document life, to display reality.  In addition, the viewers get to see how a movie is made, with many shots of the cameraman hulking the huge camera from place to place, cranking the handle in order to get the desired sequence on film.
The version I saw also has a great score by composer Michael Nyman and written biographies of the Dziga Vertov and michael Nyman.  A unique film that is a must-see for any cinophile.",1067385600,5,941,4.497076023391813
