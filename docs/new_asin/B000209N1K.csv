When I bought my house I used the information provided on this DVD and it was incredibly important to help save me money, time and aggravation! The menus are very professional and easy to find the real estate topic you need right away. Every topic is covered in detail. I purchased both DVDs in this ""Real Estate From A to Z"" series and both were excellent and I even have purchased several of these DVDs for gifts to my relatives and friends that are buying or selling their homes. The free 80 page DVD Companion Guidebook is a download file from the Nemmar Real Estate Training web site at [...] and that was a great add-on to the DVD. Overall I would say you'll HAVE TO buy this DVD if you want to save thousands of dollars and eliminate any problems when you buy, sell or renovate your house.",1081555200,6,859,4.341614906832298
8019357,3,B000209N1K,Excellent video ( funny but very informative )but still have not received promised free 80 page home inspection guide.  Please send me guide.  Thank you.,1223683200,,153,5.08
8019358,4,B000209N1K,"See my other review for a similiar DVD ikn this serie. It's the same but this time it's about the Interior and Exterior.

Totally wroth the $10 price tag, but don't expect anything detailled or in depth from this",1206403200,2,212,4.435897435897436
8019359,1,B000209N1K,"Before I give my view about Home Inspection from A to Z DVD by Guy Cozzi, I like you to have an idea about me. I am a 40 year old, very active male. My degree is in Electrical Engineering Technology, and I also majored in Theoretical Physics. I have installed dc powering plants and installed communication networks for eight years - I know who to install and program.
Now, I will state why I bought this dvd. I wanted material (book and dvd) that will illustrate on how detect damage structure (floors, ceilings, pipes, and boilers) in a house. To be able to see a very costly investment is a good thing.
After I viewed Home Inspection from A to Z DVD by Guy Cozzi, I started to laugh out loud to myself. Guy vaguely talked, not illustrated, about damage. He mainly pointed to a good wall (floor, or ceiling) and vaguely said what he thinks could happen. I felt like a Doooonkeeey after watching this dvd.",1191542400,5,906,4.398809523809524
8019360,2,B000209N1K,"This DVD looks like it was made about 20 years ago - shot with video and real cheesy annoying production. I would overlook these short comings if the information was in anyway insightful but there is not much here beyond basic common sense.

here I'll sum it up for you

1 poke wood and siding  with a awl or screwdriver to make sure its not rotten
2 shake counters and hand rails - jump on floor and stairs to see if solid
3 look for stains, mold, or cracks on ceilings and walls
4 turn appliances on & off

seriously I would only suggest this product if it were a free library rental",1187222400,5,585,4.150442477876106
8019361,5,B000209N1K,"This was a nicely done DVD by Cozzi.  I would recommend this for anyone in the real estate business, agents, home inspectors, and investors -- to know what to do/see/look for when getting into properties.  If you're interested in similar titles, I also suggest Investing  Without  Losing (ISBN 0978834607 NOT on amazn, other stores)",1163116800,2,332,5.092592592592593
8019362,4,B000209N1K,"This DVD is a straight forward overview of interior home inspection.  I bought the video to double check on my actual inspector.

By viewing this, I am sure that the real inspection was thorough and professional.

I was very impressed.",1156204800,2,235,4.825
8019363,5,B000209N1K,"This dvd was the best overall choice I made when buying books and dvds to learn about house maintenance, construction and home inspections. It would have been helpful if I purchased this sooner when I was working alongside the builder who built my house.

I wasn't aware the builders only have to follow the minimum standards with construction. After learning from the dvd I realized there were parts of the construction process that my builder could have improved upon to exceed the minimum standards.

The company that produced the dvd has other books and dvds which have received 5 star ratings from Amazon Top 50 reviewers. That was the basis for my purchase decision since I know that those reviews are always valid and trustworthy.

The dvd comes with a free download guidebook that had additional information and explains what topics are and are not covered on a $20 dvd which made sense to me. For $20 it's a great deal and wonderful information. If I need more details on any particular topic due to the limits of a dvd length then I have the dvd guidebook and this company's 400+ page home inspection book which covers everything in great detail. Each dvd in the series discussed different part of the home.

Interior and Exterior home inspection dvd topics include: roof, chimneys, siding, eaves, gutters, drainage and grading, windows, walkways, entrances and porches, driveways, walls and fences, patios and terraces, decks, swimming pools, exterior structures, wood destroying insects, garage, kitchen, bathrooms, floors and stairs, walls and ceilings, windows and doors, fireplaces, attics, ventilation, insulation, basement/lower level, water penetration.

Operating Systems home inspection dvd topics include: heating systems (gas, oil, steam, hot water, and hot air heating), air-conditioning, water heaters, plumbing, well water system, septic system, electrical system, gas service, and auxiliary systems. Health Concerns topics including: asbestos insulation, radon gas, and water testing.",1141689600,16,2010,5.4089456869009584

8019365,4,B000209N1K,"If you're looking for some helpful advice and tips on how to inspect a house then this DVD is a great choice. There are two DVDs in this series on home inspection, one covering the interior and exterior inspection, the other covers operating systems like HVAC, plumbing, water heaters, electrical, and more. Both DVDs are produced in a non-flashy movie format but the information was great and filled with techniques and ideas on what to look for when inspecting homes.

If you want to learn how to inspect your home then this DVD series is the way to go. It's not expensive and covers everything in enough detail without focusing too much on each separate topic. Well worth the money spent in my opinion.",1111708800,5,705,4.685483870967742
8019366,5,B000209N1K,"My husband and I had purchased the Real Estate Appraisal book written by this author, Guy Cozzi, and we were extremely pleased with what we learned. The book saved us tens of thousands of dollars when we remodeled our home before selling it. We also purchased both of the DVDs that Guy Cozzi created to learn even more before we remodeled our home and put it on the market for sale. The DVDs were also a very good purchase that we are happy we made. My husband and I are not real estate experts but wanted to learn enough to make sure the contractors that were going to be remodeling and improving our home were telling us everything we needed to know. We had some past experiences with contractors making repairs at our home and over-charging us for sub-standard work. Since we are not real estate or building experts, my husband and I wanted to make sure that never happened again - especially with the $115,000.00 home remodeling job we were planning. These DVDs were a great help to us in our decision making process. If you are a home seller or planning to remodel or improve your home, then the DVDs and books by this author are an phenomenal invest that is well worth the price!",1084492800,10,1185,4.465437788018433
