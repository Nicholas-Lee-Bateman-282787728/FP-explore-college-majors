I bought this with the idea in the back of my head that as soon as I got them, they wouldn't work because of the listing saying ""Format: NTSC"", which is completely wrong. The ""DVD"" is actually an interactive CD for the computer as I hoped, I live in U.K and have been dieing to get my hands on this, I put it in my computer and It worked straight away. Very Detailed tutorials, Ross Scott is an excellent teacher and now I can credit him by saying I was taught by the one and only! :)

If you are looking to make Machinima videos for YouTube or anything else using the source engine, I defiantly recommend this!! Also, the package took 3 days to get from somewhere in the U.S.A right to my doorstep in Wales. Excellent Service!",1307836800,,746,4.290780141843972
8343514,1,B001UF4R1M,"The description shows it as ""NTSC"" which means it should be a DVD, not a DVD Rom.  It is an interactive disk for the computer. I thought it was a tutorial video that you just watch.",1246924800,2,181,4.027777777777778
