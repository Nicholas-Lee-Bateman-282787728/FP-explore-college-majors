8243675,5,B0010IMA2W,"So yeah, I'm the one doing all the Mahjong movie reviews. Why? because I dig em, and I dig this one the most. It's funny and quirky though you can get lost once or twice (I don't speak Cantonese or Mandarin, so it's all subtitles baby) it's the best of the Tet Mahjong movies. The Mahjong is fun, the characters familiar and it all ends......well you'll see. Get this DVD and House of MahJong and Kung Fu MahJong 2, and remember...it's supposed to be fun.",1217980800,,455,4.364705882352941
