3584172,5,B001FBPSW8,"I've enjoyed reading Maureen Jennings' books about William Murdoch in Victorian era Canada.  I was unhappy that I could not see these movies based on the books since they were made for Canadian TV.  Now, happily, they are available for those of us in the U.S.  These are quality movies.

The acting, the sense of place, the mysteries, the atmosphere of the era are all well done. I really enjoyed watching the movies and I will watch them again.

Murdoch uses scientific methods to solve the crimes.  His co-workers and boss are skeptical of his use of fingerprints and other clues.  William Murdoch works in spite of all obstacles (social, cultural, religious) to find justice.",1235001600,19,678,4.843478260869565

I absolutely love these original 3 made for TV movies though and highly recommend them especially now they are available as a package - each one is a full length movie in its own right and each is individually based on one of Maureen Jennings' earlier books in the Murdoch series.

3584184,3,B001FBPSW8,"""Murdoch Mysteries"" is a long-running Canadian television series that began with three 90-minute made-for-TV movies in 2004 and 2005. ""Murdoch Mysteries: The Movies"" contains those three films.  All three episodes are based on novels by Maureen Jennings. They take place in 1890s Toronto, a predominantly Protestant city, and feature a Catholic Detective William Murdoch (Peter Outerbridge), who is fascinated with the new scientific methods of investigation, including fingerprints and graphology, and endeavors to apply them to his investigations while his superiors balk at the newfangled methods. As the films open, Det. Murdoch has recently lost his beloved fiance, a loss that has left him with a circumscribed outlook on life. He buries himself in his work but is pleasantly surprised to meet Dr. Julia Ogden (Keeley Hawes), a pathologist with similar interests.

Period mysteries are fun. It's nice to see people solving crimes within the limitations of their time. But I found ""Murdoch Mysteries"" too anachronistic and its hero too humorless to enjoy. The characters don't relate to one another they way people did a century ago. Their value systems and manners are inappropriate to the time, so what is the point of making it a period piece? It's like modern people playing dress-up. And, while there were female doctors in the late 19th century, the idea that a police force would hire a female pathologist defies credibility. Even the most open-minded detective would be shocked, skeptical, and very protective of her. The mores these characters express, in that and in the cases they deal with, are simply not of the time. It all seems rather cartoonish, like burlesque. Though the second and third movies are better than the first, they're just okay.

The movies are:

The naked body of a young woman is found dumped in a street near a house of ill repute in ""Except the Dying"". Det. Murdoch doesn't believe her to be a prostitute, however, as she is well-nourished and clean. He suspects two women from the nearby bawdy house, Bernadette ""Ettie"" Weston (Flora Montgomery) and Alice Duff (Rebecca Gibson), of stealing the dead woman's clothing and perhaps concealing other evidence. When Dr. Ogden informs him that the victim was pregnant and drugged, he begins to consider who had access to morphine. The dead woman is Therese Laporte, a francophone chambermaid working for the Rhodes household, who was unhappy in her job. Murdoch interviews all of the men of the household to determine who fathered Therese's child. Meanwhile, an eager Constable (David Evans) asks to learn the new ""criminalistic"" techniques.

Detective Murdoch's protg Constable Oliver Wicken (Philip Graeme) is found dead in an abandoned house, the victim of an apparent suicide. Forensic evidence at the scene is inconsistent with suicide, so Murdoch insists on investigating the death as suspicious. Dr. Ogden confirms that Wicken had ingested no alcohol, though his clothing reeked of it.  Murdoch wants to use a thumbprint on the gun as evidence at the inquest, but Inspector Brackenreid considers it mumbo-jumbo, as does the coroner (Tom Anniko), who is quick to rule the death a suicide when a secret fiance comes forward. But Murdoch is interested in Mr. Curran (Colin Glazer), who runs the stables across the lane, and his family by marriage, including the patriarch Mr. Eakins (John Gilbert), whose young third wife (Kathleen Munroe) was carted off to an insane asylum the night of Wicken's death.

Murdoch has a new boss, Inspector Ramsgate (Kenneth Walsh), and a new protg in Constable George Crabtree (Matthew MacFadzean) in ""Under the Dragon's Tail."" Dolly Shaw (Ann Holloway) is found dead by her mute daughter Lily (Tammy Isbell). Lily flees police, but 12-year-old Jim (Michael Kanev) and 7-year-old Freddie (Demetrius Joyette) tell Detective Murdoch that the dead woman sold potions for women's troubles. Upon investigation, Murdoch learns that Shaw was an abortionist. A twisted trail leads Murdoch to his old friend Ettie Westin (Flora Montgomery), who had visited Shaw the night of her death to procure an abortofacient for her assistant Millie (Taylor Trowbridge), pregnant by philandering footman John Meredith (Christopher Jacot), who works for conservative Judge Walter Pedlow (Marc Strange), whose wife Maud (Helene Joy) has something to hide.",1497139200,,4354,5.256115107913669

3584187,5,B001FBPSW8,"These TV movies bare little resemblance to the popular TV series.  There is no whit or science involved. These are truthful to the original novels written by Maureen Jenkins which the stories are based on.  Their world is gritty, dirty and dark.  Condensing the novels to just 90 minutes makes for a tight story.  Some major characters such as Mr. & Mrs Kitchen (not in the TV series) are reduced to a few brief scenes. They are very good mysteries, just not like the popular TV Series.",1495843200,,486,4.551724137931035

3584231,4,B001FBPSW8,"Having first watched the Murdoch Mysteries series, I found the movies very interesting by way of how the main characters were interpreted versus the TV series interpretation.  I prefer the TV interpretation, but that could be because I saw it first.  I particularly missed Thomas Craig's interpretation of Inspector Brackenreid and Jonny Harris as George Crabtree.  I also wondered whether Murdoch was portrayed in the movies closer to the way he was described in the books (which I have yet to read).  Yannic Bisson's portrayal of Murdoch is more user friendly than Peter Outerbridge's.  However, Mr. Outerbridge actually brings more depth to the character.  The movies are quite compelling.",1462406400,5,692,5.302752293577981
3584232,5,B001FBPSW8,"Amazing show, particularly if you like the TV series.  My wife and I got this just to compare, but in some ways it has become my wife's favorite for the extra details, realism and intensity. After see these, we now have to go back and read the books.

3584244,5,B001FBPSW8,"My wife and I have enjoyed the ongoing Murdoch Mysteries television series. The popular series is everything we look for in quality end of the day entertainment. The product featured is, in my humble opinion, a radical departure from what we've grown so fond of. The three stories are gritty and somewhat slow moving. The actors to put it quite bluntly, are simply not going to get an A+ for physical attractiveness. My wife lets me know that the ""other"" Murdoch is much better looking! The lighting is often dim. The police offices have dirty, peeling paint, and a small dim morgue that isn't nearly as nice as the one most of us have become accustomed to seeing. The second and third episodes are easier on the eyes-better lighting and more outside scenes. While this lacks the jazzy stuff, it offers a deeply moving departure from eight seasons of fluff 'n stuff. The primary actors are superb, gimmicks aren't needed. Give it a try.",1451433600,3,936,4.713414634146342
3584245,4,B001FBPSW8,"These three full length made for TV police-procedural mystery movies set in 1890s Toronto were precursors to the the hit TV series Murdoch Mysteries. They feature recognizably the same characters as in the later series, but the mood of these films is darker and grittier, with less reliance on the emerging scientific forensic techniques (though there is some.)  I'd highly recommend these for fans of Victorian era crime drama, and fans of the later series will have the added interest of seeing how it compares.  Advisory: some adult situations, language, and violence, none very extreme by current standards. The Acorn Media has very good image and sound quality.",1450224000,,666,5.157407407407407

3584279,4,B001FBPSW8,So funny heard from both friends and read reviews here where people didn't take to the series version because they liked these movies that came out ahead of the series. Well we were late to the party and watched the seven years of the series in binge style first then ran out of years released to date so picked up the movies. And we happen to favor the series more. So funny.....life can be. On a trivia note it was delightful to see the actress who plays Julia in the Series a villian in the third and last movie here. So from villian to heroin. If you are interested in the series...we recommend you watch it first then like us turn to the movies to hold you over and you may see why we favor the series...it basically has had the time to develop characters and pull you into them. But the movies are not without merit just not as fully developed and they lost several key characters in the last movie they had in the first two like the head chief of police.

3584309,5,B001FBPSW8,"Before the splendid Murdoch Mysteries TV series set in Toronto came three stand-alone Murdoch Mystery movies with a Winnipeg backdrop, starring Peter Outerbridge as Murdoch and Keeley Hawes as coroner Julie Ogden. Fans of the series should not compare and contrast: the films are wonderfully enjoyable on their own. The movies follow what we've come to expect from the adaptations of Maureen Jennings' novels, a keen-eyed cop looking to science as well as smarts to solve his cases. This version of Murdoch is less tongue-in-cheek humorous than his TV counterpart, and often relies on a prostitute-turned-police-informant for support. Like the books and series, the Murdoch movies offer absorbing historical tidbits scattered like colorful gems. Murdoch's methods might seem dated compared with the high-tech policing of the CSI/Law&Order universe, but its period charm and Murdoch's determination make this character and his entourage much more fun to watch. These films aired originally in 2004, but Acorn's remastered release gives them a crisp, almost theatrical sharpness. If you watch the films,you'll definitely migrate to the series, and vice versa. More Murdoch, please, always.",1432080000,2,1187,5.6
3584310,5,B001FBPSW8,"Fans of the television series MURDOCH MYSTERIES might be surprised to learn that three TV movies, based on the novels by Maureen Jennings, were made first. They may also be surprised to learn that these three films are very different from, and possibly superior to, the series.

Dripping with Victorian Canadian atmosphere, these three films (the first two shot in Winnipeg, the third in Toronto) get down and dirty right away with the nude body of a murdered prostitute turning up to get things rolling.

The three mysteries themselves are good, though not great. What makes these films so good is the central performance of Peter Outerbridge, There is something sorrowful about Outerbridge's Inspector Murdoch. Of course we know he is a widower, but Outerbridge himself, with his soulful eyes and appearing-to-be-easily-hurt demeanor, is a compelling presence largely in part because he is so obviously wounded.

He is a practicing, apparently devout Catholic as well, which makes him a bit of an outsider, though why this should be the case (surely other people, especially back then, were church-goers?) is not entirely clear.

Nonetheless, Outerbridge is the reason to watch these films. He is a little bit Sherlock Holmes with his interest in such newfangled ideas such as fingerprinting and his ability to keep his cool in the most stressful of circumstances. Where he differs from Holmes is his obvious interest in the opposite sex. Though clearly grieving his deceased wife, he participates in a dancing class, presumably to meet women, has a flirty professional relationship with a coroner, Dr. Julia Ogden (played by the sublime Keeley Hawes, who wisely left after two films--she is much too good of an actress to have been tied down playing essentially second fiddle), and has a reluctant, tentative relationship with Ettie, a prostitute who tries to give up her life of procurement for something more respectable, all the while being a police informant, possibly because of her attraction to Murdoch.

Ettie, by the way, is played by the brilliant Irish actress Flora Montgomery.  Her performance provides Murdoch with his most interesting female relationship, ever stunted as it may be.

The set design and lighting are to be commended in these films.  One of the failings of the TV series, in my view, is the over-lit, lack of atmosphere that makes the show look cheap in comparison. The films, by contrast, are moody and the period believable.

One point of interest. A lot of the characters in all three films take the Lord's name in vain. Murdoch never balks at this, although he is quick to respond to situations that involve some obvious points of contention to Catholic doctrine, namely suicide and abortion. With his dewy-eyed sensitivity is it not reasonable to expect Murdoch to either react with a subtle flinch perhaps, or even a chastisement or two, depending on who he is speaking with? Just a thought. But this did strike me as an inconsistency in characterization.

Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the three MURDOCH MYSTERY films.",1431993600,5,3062,5.081673306772909
3584311,5,B001FBPSW8,"Murdoch uses state of the art investigative techniques to solve 19th century crimes. Mental images flash crime scenes which also aid Murdock's work. He's seen religiously crossing himself at every murder scene. Many will try to compare TV movies to the highly successful TV series (2008-now). Both are based on Maureen Jennings novels. All 3 forms of mystery are good--each different in their form. All 3 deserve 5-stars.
I can't get enough of Murdoch's historical copper role and Victorian period crime delight.

Det Murdoch is played by Peter Outerbridge who will also appear in ""Shipwreck"", a 2015 Murdoch Mysteries TV series episode. Matthew MacFadzean does well as Crabtree. The third to appear in all 3 movies is Flora Montgomery (`Endeavour' & `Grantchester') as a prostitute.
Insp Brackenreid is Colm Meaney (you must see him in `Hell on Wheels') and Keeley Hawes (`Upstairs Downstairs') as Dr Ogden, acting coroner, and of course does it superbly. Both appear in the first 2 movies.

SDH SUBTITLES for all 3 movies. No bonus.
Disc 1: Except the Dying -novel of 1997. The nude body of a chambermaid is left in the Toronto streets of 1890s. Clue searches are taken in swanky gent clubs and the lowest brothels. Will another victim die prior to Murdoch's case closure? He uses wall & chalk to reconstruct the crime, microscope details, and hypnosis. Murdoch takes dancing lessons under a Prof Otranto (Joe Pingue -also in episode 2). William B. Davis appears as a guest star.

Disc 2: Poor Tom Is Cold -novel of 2001. Constable Wicken (Philip Graeme, in episodes 1&2) dead of a head shot, with note, smelling of drink. Suicide? Murdoch looks deeper including the Eakins family. Murdoch uses fingermarks and microscopic hair sample comparisons. Doxie, Ettie assists again. Jessica Greco, who also appears in a Murdoch series episode as another character in 2011, plays Maryanne; and the deceased constable's mother is played by Lynne Griffin (`Wind at My Back' another great Canadian series.)

Disc 3: Under the Dragon's Tail -novel of 1998. Someone murders Dolly, a midwife & abortionist. Murdoch uses graphology (handwriting analysis) plus, of course, fingermarks. Suspects include Ettie, a neighbor, and the Judge's wife Maude. Maude is played by Helen Joy who is later picked for the Dr Ogden role in the TV series.

View the older movies, the newer ongoing series, or read; whatever; but DO NOT miss Murdoch Mysteries.
Definitely one of my all-time favorite.",1430438400,13,2468,5.083950617283951
3584312,1,B001FBPSW8,"Rape, sex nudity in the first couple of minutes. Stopped watching! Is this supposed to be freedom or enlightenment??? I call it demonic! The original TV series was pretty much a family show.

3584323,5,B001FBPSW8,"I was confused when I saw the description of this movie set. ""When did Murdoch Mysteries move from Toronto to Winnipeg"", I asked myself. Of course, I had it backwards. These three movies came first! I don't know why the show moved East for the TV series, but for me it doesn't make a difference. I love the current Murdoch Mysteries series, and I love these three movies.

That said, there is some difference in characterizations between the two versions. Peter Outerbridge, playing Detective William Murdoch in the movies, is more overtly conflicted and wan. Still intelligent, honest and tenacious, of course. I did not dislike Outerbridge's portrayal, but it is different from Yannick Bisson's more closed and more cheerful version in the TV series.

Constable Crabtree is less a personality on his own in the movies, he just doesn't have the screen time. Inspector Brackenreid is marvelously portrayed in the movies by Colm Meany. Thomas Craig does a great job in the character in the TV series, but he is not as street-tough.

Now for the similarities between the movies and the TV series. The happenings at both Station No. 4's still have a lot of comedy. Not quite as much in the movies, because Crabtree's character just isn't there to carry so much of the comedy that he does in the series. They still bicycle through the city. Those not fans of the police still call them Frogs. Murdoch still has his famous blackboard, of a sorts. Here he uses one of the station's walls! Brackenreid still has a bottle in the office. There is still a female pathologist, though any romantic notions just barely begin by the 3rd movie. Murdoch's Catholic faith is still strong, and there is still prejudice against Catholics.

And, maybe best of all, the movies started the tradition of Murdoch inspecting NEW scientific ways to detect. As well as historical tidbits that are always interesting.

These movies originally aired in 2004-5 in Canada. In this 3-disc set you get 3 movies totaling 271 minutes, or 4 1/2 hours of a very good show. This DVD set is a reissue. The movies were originally released on DVD in 2008.

1. ""Except the Dying"". The middle of the night in a disreputable part of Winnipeg, a young woman's naked body is discovered in an alley. There's only one light on in the surrounding buildings, a 3rd floor flat in a boarding house with a sign in its window: ""No Dogs or Cathlics"". Murdoch interviews the women. Their occupation? Well, they're not going to say the obvious, so they give another part of the truth, ""We sell gloves for Mr. Webster on Queen Street... Men's articles, mostly, if you get my meaning. The finest pigskin. There's no loss of feeling for the gents.""
When Murdoch returns to the alley, there is a woman sketching the body. After trying to shoo her away, he finds out that she is Dr. Ogden, acting for the coroner. This is the first time they meet. Dr. Ogden becomes one of Murdoch's few allies in trying to bring criminalistics, or modern forensics, to the department.
Murdoch doesn't have time to think too much about the pathologist, though, because this wasn't the first woman killed, and they don't want there to be another.
NEW: Mesmerism (hypnotism)

2. ""Poor Tom is Cold"". It's 3 am, and Constable Crabtree is looking for Constable Wicken. Sarge is worried because Wicken didn't check in at 2 am. Unfortunately, it's because Wicken is dead, shot through the head with a printed suicide note in his hat. There's only one problem for Murdoch - the path of the bullet and blood spatter don't match the position of the body. AND, when he gets back to the station, the finger print on the gun is not Wicken's. This gets him no where with Brackenreid: ""Aw, for gawd's sake. Fingerprints! Is that what you've sunk to?""
Some of this movie's comedy stems from Murdoch taking dancing lessons. Professor Otrantos is trying to show Murdoch how to lead, ""It's called the gliding waltz, Mr. Murdoch. Glide!.... When I first saw you dance I think to myself, 'I would take this clumsy water buffalo, and make of him a gazelle'.""
Murdoch: ""A gazelle? Really?""
Otrantos: ""Alas, I have failed.""
NEW Fingermarks (fingerprints)

3. ""Under the Dragon's Tail"". Two underfed boys, Jim and Freddie, come down from their attic room to find their guardian, such as Dolly Capshaw was, dead on the floor. Her daughter, a deaf mute, keens over the body. It looks like an accidental head injury from an alcoholic stumble.
Madame Bernadette is perceptive as she mournfully tells Murdoch: ""All of them dead bodies. You're surrounded by ghosts and they won't give you a moment's peace.""
This is an excellent movie. Morals. Morays. Judgement and Prejudice. You have to watch the 1st two movies first for the background. Then sit back and enjoy this story.
NEW Graphanalysis, the comparison of handwriting samples in a scientific way. Don't confuse it with the pseudoscience Graphology, which is intuiting the writer's personality from handwriting.

The last movie ends on a humorous scene that made me grin. A perfect ending to an enjoyable TV movie series.

3584326,4,B001FBPSW8,"Before he was the protagonist of a TV series, Detective William Murdoch had a DIFFERENT kind of mystery series -- three TV movies starring Peter Outerbridge.

And ""The Murdoch Mysteries Movie Collection"" is very different from the gleaming, quirky steampunk of the TV series. Instead, the three TV movies are less glamorous and more realistic in tone -- they're more about the dirt, seediness and shadows of Victorian Toronto, where prostitution, drugs, insane asylums and brutal murders can only be served by a quiet man on a bike.

""Except the Dying"" puts Murdoch (Outerbridge) on the case of a girl found naked and strangled near the homes of several prostitutes. An autopsy by coroner Dr. Julia Ogden (Keely Hawes) reveals that the girl was not only drugged with opium, but was pregnant. And Murdoch soon discovers that the girl was connected to a rich, powerful family with some nasty secrets of their own.

In ""Poor Tom is Cold,"" Murdoch is shocked by the apparent suicide of a bright young policeman. But when his fingerprint evidence is dismissed in court, he has to find new evidence to support the murder theory -- including a prostitute hired to act, a family with a madwoman who may not be mad, and a fiancee who was engaged to two men at once. Who had the means, motive and opportunity?

Finally, ""Under the Dragon's Tail"" has Murdoch discovering that an alcoholic woman's death may have been due to something else -- she was an illegal abortionist. Despite his revulsion, Murdoch begins investigating the many motives, including her religious neighbors and the one-off boyfriend of a pregnant girl. But his case goes into nasty territory when he learns of a connection to a wealthy, prominent judge and his family... and a missing book that holds all the dead woman's secrets.

""The Murdoch Mysteries Movie Collection"" is a much darker kind of mystery than the spinoff series -- everything seems grimy and shadowy, lit by unflattering gas lamps. There's a greater emphasis on the struggles of women (prostitution, the brutally nightmarish asylum) and the lower classes than you usually see in late 1800s/early 1900s stories, as well as the early stages of modern police work.

However, the grimness of Murdoch's working life is gently leavened with a tinge of romance, and some gently humorous scenes (Murdoch's attempts to learn how to waltz, which his tired teacher compares to a ""water buffalo""). The biggest problem is that the denouements of the first two mysteries are... a little confusing. The motives of the murders aren't fully explained.

And Peter Outerbridge does a simply superb job as Murdoch -- he captures the sadness and compassion of a man who genuinely believes in justice, guided by his strong Roman Catholic faith. Even when he condemns a murder victim (like the abortionist) he still tries to give them the justice they deserve, respecting every one even after death (""Someone must speak for the dead"").

And there's a solid supporting cast, especially the two women who come to love Murdoch: Keely Hawes as a cool, clever doctor with a knack for autopsies, and Flora Montgomery as a fiery prostitute/fortune-teller. The always-awesome Colm Meaney makes a good Inspector Brackenreid, who often puts political pressure on Murdoch's investigations; and Hlne Joy (who later plays Ogden in the TV series) has a single brilliant role here.

""The Murdoch Mysteries Movie Collection"" is a darker, grimmer kind of Detective Murdoch story than you may be used to, but the brilliant performances and subtle crimes are stellar.",1424736000,51,3553,5.018675721561969

3584369,2,B001FBPSW8,"We've watched two of the three disks and were able to understand and follow the dialogue perhaps 25% of the time.  I knew there were no subtitles or closed captions from the pre-purchase research I did before ordering, but reflected that while the current series, -from the same production companies- had subtitles, the audio was mostly excellent, so I took a chance.

Some of the problem is attributable to regional accents, coupled with possibly idiomatic differences attributable to period and vernacular, but mostly, the main problem seemed caused by uneven audio sound levels, particularly the key audio between the coroner and Murdoch. The combination gave us difficulty.  My wife has some hearing loss and I suffer from tinnitus, so younger ears may have a better experience.

I will try it again when we watch the third story with my sound system on, rather than relying on the normally good sound on the TV, and see if adjusting the volume and tuning the low and high frequency levels or other futzing with the sound system will help. If it helps, we'll rerun the other two disks, since we missed significant portions of the dialogue.

I contacted BFS by e-mail enquiring if there was a different version available with subtitles, and was advised (on a week-end) there was not.

Others may not have the same experience as my wife and I, and I'll keep the video and probably donate it to the library.",1377216000,10,1408,4.821576763485477

It's fun to see Colm Meany in this one, and I thought the general of character came out well also. I liked the mystery, and thought they did a good job of portraying the time period and setting.

One thing that was missing was the great science tidbits that are in the TV version of this show. I missed the ""early CSI"" type info that we watch Murdoch invent and discover.

Come on America, only we are the remaining prudes when it comes to something as simple as the human body.  If you are over the age of 12 and male, and haven't seen the female body naked at some point, well you just need to turn life off and go back inside.  As you watch each episode, you think you have the murderer figured out but bam!  A different turn, a new clue, suddenly you find yourself guessing again.

3584395,4,B001FBPSW8,"Before he was the protagonist of a TV series, Detective William Murdoch had a DIFFERENT kind of mystery series -- three TV movies starring Peter Outerbridge.

And ""The Murdoch Mysteries Movie Collection""  is very different from the gleaming, quirky steampunk of the TV series. Instead, the three TV movies are less glamorous and more realistic in tone -- they're more about the dirt, seediness and shadows of Victorian Toronto, where prostitution, drugs, insane asylums and brutal murders can only be served by a quiet man on a bike.

""Except the Dying"" puts Murdoch (Outerbridge) on the case of a girl found naked and strangled near the homes of several prostitutes. An autopsy by coroner Dr. Julia Ogden (Keely Hawes) reveals that the girl was not only drugged with opium, but was pregnant. And Murdoch soon discovers that the girl was connected to a rich, powerful family with some nasty secrets of their own.

In ""Poor Tom is Cold,"" Murdoch is shocked by the apparent suicide of a bright young policeman. But when his fingerprint evidence is dismissed in court, he has to find new evidence to support the murder theory -- including a prostitute hired to act, a family with a madwoman who may not be mad, and a fiancee who was engaged to two men at once. Who had the means, motive and opportunity?

Finally, ""Under the Dragon's Tail"" has Murdoch discovering that an alcoholic woman's death may have been due to something else -- she was an illegal abortionist. Despite his revulsion, Murdoch begins investigating the many motives, including her religious neighbors and the one-off boyfriend of a pregnant girl. But his case goes into nasty territory when he learns of a connection to a wealthy, prominent judge and his family... and a missing book that holds all the dead woman's secrets.

""The Murdoch Mysteries Movie Collection"" is a much darker kind of mystery than the spinoff series -- everything seems grimy and shadowy, lit by unflattering gas lamps. There's a greater emphasis on the struggles of women (prostitution, the brutally nightmarish asylum) and the lower classes than you usually see in late 1800s/early 1900s stories, as well as the early stages of modern police work.

However, the grimness of Murdoch's working life is gently leavened with a tinge of romance, and some gently humorous scenes (Murdoch's attempts to learn how to waltz, which his tired teacher compares to a ""water buffalo""). The biggest problem is that the denouements of the first two mysteries are... a little confusing. The motives of the murders aren't fully explained.

And Peter Outerbridge does a simply superb job as Murdoch -- he captures the sadness and compassion of a man who genuinely believes in justice, guided by his strong Roman Catholic faith. Even when he condemns a murder victim (like the abortionist) he still tries to give them the justice they deserve, respecting every one even after death (""Someone must speak for the dead"").

And there's a solid supporting cast, especially the two women who come to love Murdoch: Keely Hawes as a cool, clever doctor with a knack for autopsies, and Flora Montgomery as a fiery prostitute/fortune-teller. The always-awesome Colm Meaney makes a good Inspector Brackenreid, who often puts political pressure on Murdoch's investigations; and Hlne Joy (who later plays Ogden in the TV series) has a single brilliant role here.

""The Murdoch Mysteries Movie Collection"" is a darker, grimmer kind of Detective Murdoch story than you may be used to, but the brilliant performances and subtle crimes are stellar.",1333497600,,3554,5.018675721561969
3584396,2,B001FBPSW8,"I am a fan of the old detective drama:  Sherlock, Poirot, Columbo and even the corny Ellery Queen.  These more modern productions lack the intelligence, good writing, good acting, and taste of the older series.

These seem designed for the modern audience who can't focus for more than 30 seconds and need constant quick changing angles, and lots of graphic nudity and violence to prevent them from tweeting their friends in the middle of the movie.

The actor in the movie series is better than the guy who played in the TV series, but still, the casting is so Holywoodish.  Where are all the character actors?

If you really have nothing to do, these aren't too bad compared to the trash that is on TV today, but don't expect much if your IQ is over 90.",1330473600,6,755,4.514705882352941
3584397,5,B001FBPSW8,"Great show with Peter Outerbridge as Murdoch, much, much better than later Murdoch series which lacks human interest or fails when it tries. Normally I am put off by injection of personal lives of detectives into the shows, but this is an exception, perhaps because it is a period piece (about 1900).

Subsequent series is okay, but the second Murdoch series lacks true to life performances, which are required for what is supposed to be a realistic show. Yannick is okay. This show is popular and I've seen six episodes. Better than most t.v. cop serieses, but could be so much better. WRiting is probably the problem-also very low production values--little money for sets and extras. This is usually okay, but in this show, being a period piece, we need better sets etc. Still, if you have Netflix and don't have to buy the dvd's this show is worth watching.",1311120000,,860,4.733333333333333

I guess I didn't read enough reviews here to get to the NUDITY warning.

3584399,2,B001FBPSW8,"I have only watched the first episode, and I find frequently that pilot episodes are the worst as directors try too hard to establish the quirkiness of the characters; however, it was so dull that I have not been encouraged to watch the rest of the episodes.  The show tries too hard to be ahead of its time.  There was a western with Tom Berenger and Amy Carlson called the Peacemakers in which a sheriff and doctor employed forensic science to solve crimes.  It was far more interesting than this series and it only lasted for nine episodes. Complicating matters is the fact that the discs won't play on my Blu-Ray in the living room so if I want to watch it, I have to play it on an older DVD player in the bedroom.

It is passable.  It has enough interesting elements to keep your attention while it is playing, but will it inspire you to watch the rest of the episodes?  The first episode is about an electrocution-murder.  The main character seeks assistance from Nicola Tessla.  That seems to be popular these day as Sanctuary on the SciFi Channel has done the same thing.  The conflict surrounds whether the town will be using the old DC electrical current for their town or the potentially dangerous AC.

Peter Outerbridge played the most of human characters compared to some of his comtemporaries in the series; always thinking of the victim first.  He plays a very gentle soul with many emotions.

The reason I gave this a 4 instead of 5 is I was not  thrilled with the amount of violence, but from what I have read that is how big cities were in the late 1800's especially violence involving poor and homeless.

Other than that I recommend the set completely.

I have not seen any of the other Murdoch series, I understand these were the only 3 with these actors - a shame as they really interacted extremely well !",1280793600,2,705,4.503937007874016
3584402,5,B001FBPSW8,"Det. Murdoch crosses himself upon entering the presence of every dead victim. That's as religious as this Victorian low-life crime show gets.
It's off to nude bodies, rape, abortionist, prostitutes, pub dancers, drugs, murdered cop, romantic vengeance, blood, and other sordid filth.

Details of the Victorian police investigations of Murdoch (Peter Outerbridge), like handcuffs restraining like screw C-clamps, are fascinating. Stories are riveting. The 'NEW' techniques Murdoch employs ,such as forensic facts, finger marks, crime scene Kodak Moments, fiber & writing analysis, and autopsy findings (to name a few) help him solve the unsolvable. Murdoch is mentor to George Crabtree (Matthew MacFadzean), teaching him the cutting-edge evidence techniques. Yes, there's a beautiful woman: Ettie (Flora Montgomery).

The 3 feature-length stories inspired a TV series (Murdoch Mysteries), 2 seasons now also available on DVD. The TV series is recast but astonishingly the characters appear similar as cast mimic the mini-series (MM Movie Collection) cast in speech and actions. Both old and new casts are excellent. Murdoch flirts with subtle Victorian-correct romance in the MM TV series which adds 26 new episodes to enjoy.

Murdoch is like a cop of the 21st century but allows us a beautiful look at the Victorian Era even if it is a bit on the seedy side of the track at times. The proper and sophisticated Murdoch makes viewers want to return to life in 1890 (with modern conveniences, of course.)

3584422,1,B001FBPSW8,"After reading the reviews and hype around this set of movies, I was looking forward to it with great anticipation.  Well, amazon.com took 8 days to get it to me.  When I finally got it, I started the first movie and it is so boring...not much movement, confused storyline, it looks like they are more interested in showcasing 1890's Toronto that in stringing along a good mystery.  Even the characterizations are so much formula...the detective who lost his love and is full of angst, the woman coroner, the curmudgeon superintendent...yeesh, are we seeing Inspector Morse all over?  Alas, the stories are just not that interesting.",1240963200,12,632,4.9904761904761905
