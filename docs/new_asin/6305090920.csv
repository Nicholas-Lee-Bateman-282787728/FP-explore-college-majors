7883989,2,6305090920,"To start off, the title of this video should have simply been ""And Other Movie Monsters"".  Yes the Big G does get more time in this 2 tape set than any other monster featured, but out of the documentary's about an hour and a half total running time, only around 20 minutes or so are actually devoted to the beloved King of the Monsters; the video opens with a fairly interesting, though somewhat superficial, segment on Godzilla which only lasts about 10 minutes, about another 5 minutes are wasted on a mixture of footage from several G films set to this completely awful and annoying ""Godzilla Rap"" tune, and the other 5 or so minutes are comprised of segments from G movies set to some boring monotone dialogue read (not necessarily spoken) by the narrator that are more or less just placed there to act simply as kind of a segue from the discussion of one non-Godzilla monster movie to the next.
Honestly, to me it seems that the only reasons that this video carries the title that it does are simply to get G fans to purchase it, and because the producers of the video decided that they needed to have some kind of featured monster to serve as the springboard into the rest of the documentary.  Personally, I would have preferred (and had hoped) that the entire first tape would have been spent discussing the origins of Godzilla at the Toho studios and then each of the individual films from the series, some behind the scenes footage would have been a nice touch as well.  Instead, the G fan is given a brief and mediocre (at best) history of Godzilla and some of the very talented men behind him.  Maybe, with the King's 50th anniversary coming up, we true G fans will finally be given the Godzilla history video we've been waiting so long for and have, to date, been so shamefully deprived of.
Over all, ""Godzilla and Other Movie Monsters"" isn't really an awful video, the film footage (some of which is quite rare) taken from the other monster movies is certainly a blessing to any fan of the genre, it just doesn't deliver the goods that a diehard G fan, like myself, so greatly desires and deserves.
On a brief sidenote, I'd like to take time right now to recant all the awful things I've said about the Heisei (2nd series of Japanese G films) in my review for ""Godzilla 1985"", and the current Alternate Universe (3rd series of Japanese G films)in my review for ""Godzilla 2000"".  ALL the Japanese Godzilla films, from 1954 through the present, are completely wonderful and imaginitive films which shouldn't be missed by any fan of Sci-fi/Fantasy movies.  Sure some of the Japanese G films are better than others (what film series isn't like that), but all are certainly landmarks not only of Asian cinema, but of film history period!
Thank you.",1014681600,4,2756,4.60285132382892
7883990,4,6305090920,"This documentary has all the history and never before scenes from the classic movies like ""King Kong"", ""Godzilla"", and pretty much every cheesey monster that has graced the silver screen. It is well  put together and shows the many trials and tribulations of all these  monsters. Thrill to the showing of ""Frankenstine Conquars the  World"", ""Reptilicus"", ""Land Before Time"", and  ""Fantaisia"". It woul'd have gotten 5 stars but that stupid  ""Godzilla Rap"" is awful. It rears its ugly head every 20 minutes.  They edited the scenes from all the films together nicely, but this rap was  totally bogus! Why couln't they spent a little more money and used Blue  Oyster Cult's ""Godzilla""? It would have been much, much, better.",953856000,8,721,5.0
