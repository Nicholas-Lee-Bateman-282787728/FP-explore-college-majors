5067215,5,B0079K4WCG,I ran across this movie while surfing Netflix and was totally drawn into it and was shocked at the ending. The person considering suicide was in a terrible situation and anyone with any compassion could identify with his plight. I will certainly suggest this to my friends. I felt the acting was first class and one could identify with everyone in it.,1362960000,4,351,4.67741935483871

5067217,3,B0079K4WCG,"I had no clue what this film was about when I set up to watch it on pay-per-view.  But with all the faux ""documentaries"" floating around lately, I should have known...and I feel foolish for not knowing.  Anyway, through the eyes of a viewer who actually thought this might be a documentary, I thought this movie was going to be psycho/sociological ""experiment"" about the mentality of what an individual goes through and what they do to their surroundings regarding suicide.  Instead, I mostly saw a narcissistic, snot-nosed, evil, opportunistic, greedy, kid narrator with a slut of a former girlfriend who seemed to relish in exploiting and coaching the suicide victim's demise.  I was actually surprised, but glad, to see the narrator's demise but should have seen it coming a mile away.

Now that I know it was a ""mockumentary"", I say kudos to (real) director for making it believable, but I would hope that for the sake of mankind, no human being would ever actually act as tackless and inhumane as the (fake) director in real life.",1343347200,2,1035,4.824858757062147
5067218,4,B0079K4WCG,"Be prepared for a film that pushes the documentary boundaries. Not only is it well written and well made, but it never stops going, it takes the test to the limit, how much can you as a viewer handle and how enveloped will you get? The lines of reality blur in this sad, scary film that brings a controversial topic to screen.",1342742400,3,326,4.274193548387097
5067219,5,B0079K4WCG,I went into this movie knowing it wasn't a documentary but ten minutes in I was convinced it was. The performances are great and the movie touching. I think I felt every emotion during the 90 minutes. I only got to see it because a friend recommended it to me. I am recommending it to you. Watch it you won't be disappointed.,1339372800,8,325,4.258064516129032
5067220,5,B0079K4WCG,"Daniel Stamm's A Necessary Death leads the viewer to places most of us fear to venture. The path the film takes is one thus far unique to the mockumentary genre of cinema, at first we laugh in disbelief at the protagonist's objective and vain attempts to procure a subject but our emotions become sharply altered as the story progresses.
The plot takes a number of sorrowful and suspenseful turns as the interests of each member of the film crew collide after the subject: Matt involuntarily captivates each person who have begun to experience remorse about the project they have undertaken.
The film is carried by exceptional performances from both GJ Echternkamp and Matt Tilley and an authoritative hold on the narrative by Stamm. There is no skimping on the development of the supporting characters either however, Valerie Hurt brings a level of sentiment and striking selflessness that the entire audience will be able to identify with and Michael Traynor effectively manages to add bursts of both humor and realism to the darker moments of the film's latter half. In sum, the film is skillfully crafted from start to finish with a thrilling pace set so that the viewer's attention is consistently rapt.",1338854400,10,1208,4.985148514851486
5067221,1,B0079K4WCG,"Horrible acting punctuated by ridiculous stunt driven plot points. I really don't know which was worse, the repeated appearance of the Union Jack underpants or Gilbert John's ""acting."" Take a bubble bath, read a cereal box, call someone you don't really like for a chat... all better use of your time.",1338508800,3,301,4.921568627450981
5067222,4,B0079K4WCG,"I didn't know what to expect when I watched this film. I mean, a film about suicide! BUT, it is soooo much more than that. The filmmakers spend less time on the fact that there is a suicide and more on the fact of what happens when a group of people embark on a journey together, that seems like a good idea but turns out not to be. Things get complicated. People are betrayed. Lines get crossed. In the process, you learn a little about yourself. I really liked this movie a lot. I thought about it for days and days after. What would I do? Highly high recommend.",1338249600,11,564,4.18348623853211

8512865,3,B0079K4WCG,"-.- hmmm you know that one person who thought the Blair Witch Project was real? That was me...feeling like an idiot.  Same with this--I was probably the one person who didn't realize the entire time that this wasn't real.  It was thought-provoking and, I think, well acted, but still.  People have a right to know that this isn't real.  Do not get emotionally invested in another pseudo-documentary pretending to be real life.  It's a tough subject to deal with and it made me angry when I realized it was all fake.  And the main guy doing the ""documentary""--he would probably be one of the most selfish, spoiled, uncaring individuals I've seen.  Watch this for ""Matt""'s story, but nothing else.  Shame on the real director for exploiting such a sensitive issue for ""shock value"".",1407542400,5,780,4.81203007518797

8512869,5,B0079K4WCG,"I was in the mode of watching documentaries so I was completely convinced it was a documentary.  My morbid curiosity pulled me in and near the end I wasn't even sure I wanted to finish it. I'm so gullable!  But I had a pure reaction, I shrieked and then I cried.  I was traumatized!  Of course then I googled it and found out it was really a mockumentary, but Bravo!  It totally sucked me in.  I want to laugh, but I'm still a little traumatized. Now I want to recommend this to others, but without letting them in on the secret.  <devious smile>",1375833600,6,546,4.242718446601942
