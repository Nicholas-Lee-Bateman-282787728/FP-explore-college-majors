8187693,5,B000A6NCLS,"I remember not being able to watch this when it aired on TV in the late 70's.  God, the controversy over this film!  I'm sure it will seem a tad ""dated"" the next time I see it, but it was a huge milestone in the seventies and set the stage for other honest and accurate portrayals of gay life to follow--on TV and the big screen.  So, where's the DVD?",1364428800,,351,3.9857142857142858
8187694,4,B000A6NCLS,"Based on a true story, a lesbian (Gena Rowlands) and her lover (Jane Alexander) share a home with their children. Rowlands' ex-husband (Clu Gulager) is unaware of the sexual relationship until the oldest son moves in with him. Gulager then moves to commence legal proceedings to win full and permanent custody of the children. For the year 1978, this was a pioneering film dealing with homosexuality. It is an astonishing drama that is directed by Jerry Thorpe, no stranger to films about societal conflict. The acting is also well done without being banal or overly sentimental. Like the landmark films `That Certain Summer' in 1972 and `An Early Frost' in 1985 (also with Gena Rowlands), this movie presented mature and considerate views of homosexuality in everyday life. William Blinn, (who also wrote `Brian's Song' among other films), wrote the screenplay intelligently and without histrionics. Pro- and anti-gay groups are presented evenly without any demonizing as are Rowlands' and Gulager's views. While the film may seem a bit dated from when it was shown almost thirty years ago, it still retains the bulk of its power.",1150675200,3,1131,5.118918918918919
