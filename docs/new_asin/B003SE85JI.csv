4187947,2,B003SE85JI,"This is one of those films listed on the IMDb where the User Rating is dismal (3.4 out of 10 Stars), yet all the viewer reviews are glowing (8 Stars or better), which should tell you one thing: A lot of reviews for low-budget horror flicks like this are either written by people who worked on the film using pseudonyms or they were written by friends of people who worked on the film. This practice runs rampant on IMDB (even to the opposite effect, where people are writing negative reviews for films they most probably never saw because they hold grudges against a director or actor), so my advice is this: Use IMDb as a tool, but judge a film based only by what you see with your own eyes or, trust my judgment (wink, wink!). Which brings us to BLOODWOOD CANNIBALS. This no-budget serio-comic send-up of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST (1980) works on a few levels, but fails miserably on many other levels. The basic premise for this film is so simple it could be written on half of a cocktail napkin. The members of a cable TV show called ""Hunting The Unknown"", where every week they go to a different part of the world to find a legendary monster (and usually faking their findings; real cable is full of these types of shows, where they promise results and then s*** in your hand), are in the Pacific Northwest (actually filmed in Butte County, California) to fake a Bigfoot documentary and pass it off as real. But what they run in to is much more dangerous (Can you guess what it is? I bet you can.). The film opens with an off-screen female narrator speaking as if she is narrating a wildlife documentary, saying that animals have come very close to human population due to forest fires or human invasion of their land and they pose a danger to humans if they are not careful. Then we see a cannibal grab a fat kid in a cowboy hat as the female narrator says, ""Yes, the hungry pack will eat good tonight!"" We are then introduced the the faux documentary team, which includes English host Nigel Thorne (Nathan Anthony Carter); his unwitting guide and tracker Roy (Matthew Corbett Davis), who believes this is a serious show, since he once lost a good friend called Harry Duncan in this part of the forest years ago; cameraman Mark (Darren Courtney); Producer Lindsey (Kate Corey); her personal assistant Jenna (Angie Griffin, who disappears from the film after one scene!) and joker soundman Dave (director/producer/writer/editor/etc. Joshua Siegel). When Roy finds out that this show is nothing but a hoax and says he thought that their Chubacabra episode looked real, Dave replies, ""We faked that episode by paying a Puerto Rican boy five dollars to run around in a Halloween costume!"" Roy is not amused, and when they find a mute girl in a stream, they try to talk to her, but she takes a bite out of Roy's arm and Roy uses a tranquilizer dart on her so they can take her to the hospital. This, of course, makes the TV News, where reporters show the mute girl's photo onscreen and ask anyone if they know who this ""Jane Doe"" is to please call the station or the police, and just emboldens Nigel to change the plans on this episode (They are all at a bar, including new female production assistant TJ [Cori Jenab], when Nigel toasts, ""To Jane Doe, our first real catch!""). The team goes to the hospital to find out Jane Doe's progress and the doctor tells them that she recently had a baby in the past few weeks and that she also bit two nurses and broke an orderly's wrist. The doctor is also worried about a very virulent strain of meningitis that is in Jane Doe's blood (Roy is beginning to act strange since he has been bitten by her), but an official from the State Mental Health Facility has come to put her in an institution. As she is being put in the van, she bites the official's arm and runs into traffic. Nigel grabs her hand to try and save her, but she is hit by an SUV and dies (all Nigel holds is Jane Doe's severed hand!). It is at that point that Nigel decides he and his team will go back to the forest to try and find the baby and ""Big Papa"", the man who fathered the baby. Everyone else is against the idea (including Roy, who is acting stranger by the hour), but since Nigel pays the bills, they have no choice but to follow him. Once in the forest, Roy follows Jane Doe's tracks and everyone gets to know him better (He's an Iraq Veteran), while a hipster photographer nearby has his scalp ripped-off and one of two hunters is disemboweled (we watch him playing with his exposed intestines). The second hunter is knocked-out with the butt of his shotgun. The team goes deeper in the woods (where they discover a tree adorned with strange man-made objects) and Mark gives TJ a second camera so she can shoot additional footage, but when she hears Lindsey say, ""Nature definitely has a dark side."", she becomes extremely worried (and rightfully so). As they search for Big Papa (Joe Calavita), they are about to find him and a whole lot more. After they set up camp and jokester Dave farts repeatedly around the campfire (and inside his tent into Mark's face), they awaken in the morning to find human footprints encircling their camp. The second hunter (remember him?), wakes up, flees from the cannibals, falls off a small cliff and then gets eaten alive by the pack of flesh-hungry humans. Nigel stupidly wants to use Lindsey and TJ as bait (TJ nearly was attacked when she ventured into the woods alone earlier in the film), but it is Nigel who becomes Big Papa and his clan's victim when they surround the campsite, disembowel Nigel and tear him apart limb from limb. Roy recognizes one of the cannibals as his long-lost friend Harry Duncan (Chris Madrigal), but Harry doesn't recognize him, so they all head to a cave to hide out, while Roy booby-traps the area (one cannibal has his leg removed at the knee thanks to one of Roy's traps). Dave suddenly goes bonkers and imagines he is covered in ants (previously, Dave mooned the cannibals and Lindsey says, ""Dave, don't taunt the cannibals!""), so he runs right into one of Roy's booby traps and has his upper torso severed from the rest of his body. The group gets separated and TJ is nearly devoured by one of the cannibals, but Roy saves her by cutting out one of the cannibal's eyes (Big Papa finds the eye and shoves it back into the cannibal's empty eye socket!). TJ accidentally kills herself when she runs away, trips and impales herself on a protruding tree branch. Lindsay and Mark get away, but not before being bitten, while Roy strips off his shirt, covers his torso in mud and does his best Schwarzenegger impression while growling like a madman and killing the cannibals one-by-one. Mark sacrifices his life so Lindsey can get away, but she is chased by cannibal Big Bad Mama (Carolyn Davidson; the director's mother), where they both fall into a river. Once on the bank, Lindsay bashes Big Bad Mama's face in with a rock until she has no face at all (all we see is the heavy rock sunken into the cannibal's face). Roy fights Big Papa and wins (he takes a huge bite out of Big Papa's neck) and becomes the new leader of the cannibal clan. The finale shows us that Lindsey has been saved but, she too, has become a cannibal. Humans are, indeed, the most deadly animal.  While this film starts out humorously enough (it was originally filmed as BLOODWOOD), jack-of-all-trades Joshua Siegel (his only feature film at the time this review was written) ruins the film with his over-reliance on bad CGI for a good number of the kills, even resorting to using it when Lindsey and Big Bad Mama fall into the river! The just-plain bad CGI takes you right out of the film (especially Dave's death, which is simply awful), with CGI blood spurting into the air and badly-rendered body parts flying everywhere. While there are a few practical effects (the scalping, for one), there just aren't enough to make this a film that you must watch. There is some nice scenery and the sequence where Mark and Lindsey must traverse a shaky waterway flume on the side of the mountain does build some suspense, Siegel has definitely bitten off more than he can chew (pardon the pun), which is why he is making short films today. The acting ranges from OK to simply terrible (Nathan Anthony Carter's English accent is especially wonky) and the cannibals are nothing but regular people dressed in tattered clothes, horrible store-bought ogre teeth and bad wigs probably purchased at a Salvation Army store. Seems like the User Ratings on IMDb were right here and the actual reviews are nothing but a bunch of propaganda rubbish. Stay away. Also starring Braiden Thorn, Steve Everson, James Walton and Michael & M. Conan Duch as the hunters. An Eagle One Media DVD Release. Not Rated.",1395446400,,8747,4.574888463989803
4187948,4,B003SE85JI,This movie far exceeded my expectations. What starts as a spoof of the finding bigfoot TV shows turns into a spoof of hillbilly cannibal movies and goes on to poke fun at Predator and Last of the Mohicans of all things. Yes it is low budget with no big name actors but that doesn't diminish it's sheer goofiness and sense of fun. If you like horror movie spoofs this is one of the good ones. The scenes of the camera man carrying around giant plastic bigfoot feet is something I will remember forever.,1385769600,3,501,4.397849462365591
4187949,4,B003SE85JI,"I snagged this on a lark while at a store that had deals on their used DVDs. It looked fun enough and wasn't hurting my wallet too much. And it turned out to be so much more than I could ever have hoped for. BLOODWOOD CANNIBALS is a stellar low budget horror film. The filmmakers were obviously influenced by a great deal of prior cinema, and not all within the horror genre. But the repeated pop culture references - minus any annoying wink-wink-nudge-nudge - to various other films are delivered with finesse, as homages. It's loaded with incredible in-jokes in other words. It also does an amazing thing by combining grisly hick horror with not a nihilistic tone but instead a fun tone. It takes getting used to but it doesn't take long to do so. The cast and crew obviously had a blast on this movie, about the cast and crew of a web program of the paranormal/cryptozoological variety and find a much more down to earth but much more dangerous variety of ""wild"" life. The fun permeates the atmosphere, seeping out of the TV. The blend of a fun tone (I'm sorry but that's just the right word, ""fun"") and comical notes with generous gore and a horror story works wonders. The balance of horror, action and comedy is a delicate one, indeed, and a strong wind of unsteady hands in the creative end of things would have brought the whole thing down in pieces. But everything in this movie achieves a perfect proportion with the other bits and the whole. Hillbilly horror aficionados really should do themselves the favor and check this out. For real.",1370304000,4,1549,4.575539568345324
4187950,1,B003SE85JI,"A film crew finds a feral woman in the woods and captures her.  Upon her capture she bites on of the crew members.  From there the crew takes her to the hospital.  At the hospital, the doctors determine the woman gave birth about 6 months ago but the baby probally died since the woman isn't lactating.  Nigel (leader of the film crew) decides to find the father of the feral woman's baby. So the crew gets picked off one by one in the woods along with a couple of hunters and a flower photographer.  Just when all hope is lost, one of the members of the film crew decides to use his military training to hunt the cannibal hunters...very LAME.

At one point the military guy swings some speciality knife at one of the cannibals and removes the cannibal's eye.  The leader of the cannibals comes along and picks up his friend's eyeball and shoves it back in the socket.  Yep, it is LAME!

The cannibals are biters!  Just about everyone gets bitten/eat alive.  Then when the cammera pans back all of a sudden the victim's entrails are hanging out of their stomach.  Did I mention this movie is LAME.

The growling and grunting got annoying.  I get the cannibals are primal; but why does the military crewman grunt too.  I suppose he is going primal as well.  Also, the military crewman recognizes one of the cannibals from his military training......so apparently, being in the woods causes one to only grunt and growl.

The acting was very BAD.  At times it seemed to be just spoken with no emotion behind it at all.

The costumes the cannibals wore were SAD.  A group of men/women walking around in jeans with bad head gear on.  The lead cannibal wears cut off jeans, no shirt and animal pelts on his head with some tiny bones dangling from it.

I paid $5.75 for this movie and it is in our ""Half Price Bookstore box"".  Once we load up a box of stinkers we drop them off over there for a buck or so.  I only hope that if someone feels compelled to see this movie they get it for less than what I paid for it; however, I do NOT recommend this movie.

If you want to see a woodsey cannibal movie I would suggest Wrong Turn...any of the Wrong Turn franchises would be better than this attempt at horror.",1369958400,2,2200,4.359605911330049
4187951,5,B003SE85JI,"The movie's best feature is the music. Well done. My friends kids watched it at 13 and 10. It wasn't horribly scary, just good, and entertaining. Would like to own it.",1359504000,,167,4.419354838709677
4187952,4,B003SE85JI,"The movie opens smartly as a documentary of the ecosystem of the Pacific NW, claiming the area is large and diverse enough to support large predators. WE then see a young boy abducted by a cannibal. Sweet!. We know he is a cannibal because it is in the title of the movie. Bloodwood gets it name from the reddish tree bark appearance.

The movie shifts to a film crew shooting scenes of Nigel (British accent) trying to locate Big Foot. In trying to find Big Foot they come across a feral woman who they capture, but not without the guide getting bit. Those who watch zombie movies will be able to appreciate the implication.

Nigel decides to shift gears and hunt for other feral people in the words. The crew enters the forest the same time as does a flower photographer and 2 hunters. At this point the plot is established and it is just a matter of who lives and who dies...and who gets bit.

I was really impressed for a low budget film. The acting was decent. The dialouge, somewhat amusing. The movie was written, produced, directed, camera man, boom man and starring Joshua Siegel. It is a worthwhile view for those who don't take their horror films too seriously.
