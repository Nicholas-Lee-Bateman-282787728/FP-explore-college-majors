8477034,4,B005KMQU9S,"I am very pleased with the content of this documentary.  If you are a seeker of truth, this film is a must have. I would have given it 10 stars if i could have. The reason i only gave it 4 was a protest to the soft ending.",1478995200,,222,3.625
8477035,1,B005KMQU9S,"I don't know if I should laugh, cry or vomit.  This is another example of how we are supposed to believe certain things about the history of Christmas without asking for documentation.  And in this case we probably shouldnt even ask for the author/producers academic credentials.  She probably graduated from Diploma Mill U.

We are supposed to believe the Yule log, something that is chopped and burned is a pagan phallic symbol.  For whom?  Lorena Bobbit?

I watched the program while trying to take notes at the same time, so I could have missed some of the visuals, but as near as I can tell the closest the program comes to providing documentation is to show a picture of a book entitled Encyclopedia of White Magic A Seasonal Guide.  But this visual was blurry and small.  There is no hope of seeing who the author is.  But no matter.  In all likelihood this book doesnt provide documentation for its claims or either its documentation ultimately goes back to somebody like Bede or Herodotus who themselves didn't provide any documentation for their claims.

But if a lie is told often enough, people will be stupid enough to accept it as the truth.

The program repeats the claim that Mithra was the god of the unconquerable sun and he was born on December 25.  Except that Sol Invictus is the unconquerable sun and there is no known primary source documentation to say that Mithras birthday was celebrated or that he even had a birthday.

According to the program by 270 AD Aurelian set aside December 17-24 with gift-giving on December 25 to celebrate the birth of the sun god, and the name of this celebration later became known as Saturnalia to honor Saturn the god of excess.  But, the earliest primary source documentation for Saturnalia that I can find comes from the writings of Gaius Valerius Catullus who died in 58 BC.  And Saturn was not a sun god, but rather the agricultural god of plenty, not excess.

The program repeats the standard claim that in the 4th century the Church adopted pagan holidays to attract pagans to Christianity.  Except by the 4th century Christianity was the dominant religion in the Roman Empire.  There weren't many pagans left to attract.

The program repeats the standard claim that in the 7th century Pope Gregory I ordered Augustine of Canterbury to incorporate paganism into Christianity in order to convert the Saxons of England.  Except that the native Celts far outnumbered the Saxons and the two had been living together since the 5th century or so.  The Saxons would have long been exposed to Christianity because they migrated (they did not invade according to the known archaeology) to an Island where the Romanized Celts were already Christian.  Bede is our main source of information about Saxon Christianity, and Bede was essentially a story teller, i.e., a liar.

The program claims during the Middle Ages in England druidic rituals were part of Christmas.  Except that the druids were killed off by the Romans in the 1st century AD, and the Celts didn't have a written language for anyone to know what druidic rituals were.

The program claims that Cottom Mather preached an anti-Christmas sermon on Christmas Day in 1712.  But, unless Christmas Day in 1712 (with the Julian rather than the Gregorian calendar still in place) was a Sunday Puritan Churches would have been closed by law.

The program claims that Christmas lights comes from the Dark Ages European custom of putting oil-lighted wick lamps in windows during the 12 Days of Christmas so the neighbors will know that the occupant is worshipping the phallic Yule log.  But where did northern Europeans in the Dark Ages get lamp oil?  There were still monsters in the ocean outside the sight of land so whaling was impossible, and olives don't grow in northern Europe.

The program claims that the Christmas tree comes from the pagan practice of chopping down evergreen trees, bringing them inside and decorating them as idols representing sex and fertility.  Again, Lorena Bobbit.",1419984000,,4005,4.859882005899705
8477036,1,B005KMQU9S,"This was one of the most offensive pieces of fundamentalist propaganda I have ever seen.  I am a humanist and a very spiritual individual., and I honor everyone's spiritual path.  This film portrayed anything other than their Christianity as 'dark' or evil - even Solstice.  Who wouldn't celebrate the return of the sun, regardless of its early roots? While they did get a large portion of the grizzly history of early yule rituals right, which is indeed horrible, they also attempt to cast the same light on modern day Wiccans and Pagans who celebrate the earth and its natural place in what is no longer understood as a three-tiered universe.  (Somebody probably needs to let the producers of this piece of garbage know that the earth is not flat after all!) Even more offensive was their insinuation that all Christians believe that life begins at conception, which is an absolute lie used to spread their anti-choice vitriol. Many Christians are pro-choice which they again denigrated by categorizing such free thinkers as ""pro-abortion"".  I was appalled.  I would recommend this to nobody!",1419120000,,1094,5.016574585635359
8477037,5,B005KMQU9S,"I thought this was very informative. It exposed the Pagan roots of Christmas and the traditions. Even though I did not agree with every premise they made; it did make me think. If you plan to watch it, be prepared to have your beliefs challenged!",1413590400,,246,4.488888888888889
8477038,1,B005KMQU9S,"Started as an (somewhat) informative and (supposedly) unbiased look at the celebrations that predated Christianity, and what the Catholic church had done to help bring people into the fold - then at about 31 min in it turned into a condemnation of modern paganism and diatribe on the 'attack on Christmas and Christianity'... I suppose I should have taken the time to read who the producer was before I rented it. I just wanted a history lesson!!",1388102400,,446,4.805194805194805
8477039,1,B005KMQU9S,"This film is pure religious propaganda. If you are looking for a documentary that is actually informative about Christmas, try Christmas Unwrapped - The History Channel. I could only sit through about a third of this one. It paints ""pagans"" as depraved sex addicts that did nothing but fornicate on the street and perform human sacrifices. If it wasn't for that I would be able to forgive the poor film quality and the fact that the ""information"" was put out in a manner that seemed like I was sitting through a college lecture. I wasted my money. Don't make the same mistake.",1387324800,4,576,4.6568627450980395
8477040,5,B005KMQU9S,"This is an excellent film showing the origins of the pagan customs of Christmas. I thought I knew much , but this film really broke it down.",1362873600,,140,4.222222222222222
8477041,5,B005KMQU9S,I wish this program was longer. It was very informative. I will also show it to my children. Everyday should be about Christ our Lord and Savior!,1360627200,2,145,4.407407407407407
8477042,1,B005KMQU9S,"While not particularly ""Satanic Panic"" material per se, it is interesting to see fundamentalists criticizing the practices, even of their own kind, though varied denominations. Seems Jeremiah Films do not enjoy much. Same basic mentality. Their recommendation instead of xmas practices? Just like with Halloween, pestering people with propaganda & indoctrination.

The Unwrapping of Christmas simplistically traces the etymology of xmas traditions from 'Jul' {a Scandinavian solstice celebration, not an ancient God; ""Yule"" derivation}, the Roman Saturnalia {a celebration of the flesh, which I prefer to refer to as ""Satanalia""}, ""Christ Mass"" celebrations {likened Mardis Gras, drunken debauchery wherein the carousing was so intense, that the Catholic Church banned it for a time}, Odin [transformed into Santa, although there is no mention of Thor's goat-steeds}, a story written by a father for his children, and the Krampus {...or dare you pronounce his name aloud, ""Knecht Ruprecht""; transformed into reindeer and elves, though various faeries, gnomes (like the tomte and nisse, also omitted), sprites, and sylphs remain ""unwrapped"" here}.

From yule logs {delineated as a phallic symbol, which it may be, although they tend to redundantly over-emphasize}, mistletoe {which leads to temptation}, the xmas tree {condemned as a Pagan practice in the moldy babble at Jeremiah 10: 3-5}, xmas lights {sacrificial Pagan bonfires}, to even the dispensation of presents and candied confections, which they associate with the evils of Halloween. No mention of yule goats, cats, or mountain trolls {Gryla}, not even El Caganer or Caga Tio. And yes, it is widely known by now that the folkloric jesus character's birth was not even in December, but designated sometime in the Spring, probably to add some credibility.

The same weakan footage is shown recycled from the other 'Pagan Invasion' presentations, including scenes of Druids at Stonehenge {during relations of human and animal sacrifices upon the bonfire}. Interviews include Captain Bringdown & Colonel Bummer.

Of course, the Satanic celebration is that of the Winter Solstice, including whatever decorations that suit personal taste, although they tend to be elegantly dark, with the inclusion of Krampus, as essentially, the Winter Devil. A recognition of The longest night of the year, the changing of the seasons from Autumn {Belial} to Winter {Lucifer}, and the epicurean pleasures of one's choosing.

As the wheel of the gods turn, as is typical of blindlighters, here is yet another example of one mythology trying to discredit, or 'expose' another. In this case, the nazarene myth, which represents weakness, poverty, self-sacrifice, suffering, misery, etc., versus the Santa myth, which despite the origins, has come to represent wealth, robust health, & indulgence! They teach their children to believe in tales of a desert dwelling suicidal madman, yet deride the fables of childhood fancy. It is a rather moot point, but amusing, nonetheless.

8477043,5,B005KMQU9S,"I had already viewed it from a friend and wanted it to share with family.  There was only one minor issue I had with it.  She said that Sukkot started on 29 September.  Well, it may have the year that the DVD was made, but it is not always the same date on the Gregorian calendar.  Other than that, it will, hopefully, help persuade my family of what I have been trying to tell them for a couple years -- that Christmas has absolutely nothing to do with Yeshua.",1350345600,4,461,4.146067415730337
