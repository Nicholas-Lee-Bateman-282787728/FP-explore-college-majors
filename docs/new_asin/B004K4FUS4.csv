8432166,4,B004K4FUS4,"THE SCHOLASTIC Treasury offers favorite children's books on dvd using music and animation of the actual books to help your chikdren read and be interested in books.  These dvd's are among my kid's favorites,  Stars! Stars!Stars!  And The Paperboy being among them.  If you try any of them, try this one, the  Wheels on the Bus or the Christmas one   Some of the stories work better for older children and the younger ones will love goodnight gorilla and  chicka chicka boom boom",1377648000,,478,4.7439024390243905
8432167,1,B004K4FUS4,"My son LOVES the ""I'm Dirty"" book, so I was really excited to get this video, figuring he would love it as well. Unfortunately, the video of ""I'm Dirty"" was great, but the rest of the videos on the disc are ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. They are nothing like ""I'm Dirty"" - they are slow paced, boring, and have nothing to do with construction or trucks. Even one that sounded promising (Paper Boy) was so slllooowwww that my 3 year old couldn't stand it. This purchase was really disappointing and a waste of money. $10 is too much for just the few minutes of ""I'm Dirty"" that my son will watch. I'm returning it.",1372118400,,604,4.401785714285714
