5747980,5,B00CX1OHOY,"This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen about infidelity. The writing was superb. The acting was adequate The direction was fine. In a scene at the end the director messed up several two shots and cut off part of the head of one of the main actors. There were maybe two lines that I couldn't understand but otherwise this was a perfect film. It should have been released in the theaters. The music was great. I have seen several movies lately that dealt with married couples and their problems. None of them were half as good as this. I highly recommend this film for couples and especially married couples. I felt for all of the characters. They were all well developed and the script was so well written that every scene rang true. Frank E. Jackson Jr. wrote and co-directed this film. He did an excellent job. He will undoubtedly continue to produce quality work. Walter Maxfield Jones and especially Chante Bowser and Tamieka Davis were excellent in their roles. These two women really nailed their parts and they are both incredibly sexy. This film would be rated PG-13. One F-bomb and brief, partial nudity in one scene. I respect the fact that the writer/director did not use sex or profanity to tell the story. Great writing and passionate acting told the story. I highly recommend this film. Five star rating.",1410825600,,1331,4.6440677966101696
5747981,5,B00CX1OHOY,Ienjoyed  the  movie  It  was  worth  the  money. Iwould  love  to  see  more  movie  like  this  movie  really  enjoyed  the  movie.,1377475200,2,133,4.476190476190476
5747982,3,B00CX1OHOY,"Please note. There are two films by the same title, vastly different. Amazon has lumped the reviews together so it appears I have reviewed the wrong film if you are looking at the other film with the same title. So please PERNILLA, stop leaving silly worry wort notes on my review being in the wrong place and BTW get a life.

This is an African-American film that deals with ""the relationship."" This is a rather boring film with borderline characters. Delroy (Walter Maxfield Jones ) has discovered his BBW wife April (Tamieka Chavis) is having an affair with his son's basketball coach (William Lash). He is a great husband and father he claims as he confides to Jasmine (Chant&eacute; Bowser ) a stranger he meets in a bar, She has her own issues and Delroy listens attentively and helps her as he develops a platonic relationship with her.

His wife's affair is of course his fault because he didn't pay this kind of attention to his wife, whose dream is to open her own beauty salon.

Writer/director Frank E. Jackson jr. has hit the nail on the head in about 105% of the relationships out there...an idea given to him by a woman, imagine that. Unfortunately Frank failed to create characters that weren't cardboard and a script that would hold interest.

3 stars for the effort.

5748013,5,B00CX1OHOY,Yes! A very decent independent film with a lovely story line.  Scene with the uncle at the hospital was a little forced but cool. A little extra ending would have been better. Still...five stars...beautiful acting and cast.,1512691200,,223,5.027027027027027

5748051,1,B00CX1OHOY,I only thought I would write this review so that other film-makers with low budgets wait to make a Black film until they have the resources to do a better job than this junk......The film seem to have been shot completely with some cheap video camera (instead of film) - The acting was some of the worst I have ever seen. Star female characters extremely overweight without any camera appeal or acting ability.  The whole thing was just a mess from start to finish.,1487548800,,465,4.535714285714286
