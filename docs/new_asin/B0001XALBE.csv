8017546,3,B0001XALBE,"Han matado a Tongolele is a rare incursion by director Roberto Gavald&oacute;n into the world of cabarets. He guarantees a general good execution, with notable ""mise en camera"" of the musical numbers, filmed with above average grace, based on a winding crime story by Ram&oacute;n Ob&oacute;n, the creator of ingenious plots of Mexican horror films, such as the classic El vampiro and Misterios de ultratumba. It is a story of jealousy, passion and death in a variety theater, in which Tongolele has bedazzled the entire male cast: a young journalist (David Silva), a Chinese magician (Seki Sano), the stage director (Julian de Meriche) and an ex-lover (Manuel Arvide), as well as the theater manager (Jos&eacute; Baviera), for economic reasons. However, everyone hates the idea of losing the star one way or another, when she announces her plan to marry Silva. However, the weakest point in the whole thing is precisely Tongolele, a beautiful girl from Washington who made a career in Mexico as an exotic dancer, but whose limited histrionic capacity shows when she interacts (with a slight accent) with her co-protagonists. Besides her numbers are rather bland. They say comparisons are odious, but there is a fact that cannot be hid: Tongolele's dance is a repetitive pelvic movement that pales in front of the wiggle of her colleagues Nin&oacute;n Sevilla, Meche Barba, Rosa Carmina or Maria Antonieta Pons, who literally tore down the house whenever they heard the beat of congas and bongos. Apart from this, add a loose leopard, a jealous Chinese wife (Concepci&oacute;n Lee) and a drug addict chorus girl (Lilia Prado) and her twin sister, and you can spend a little over one hour of music, mystery and melodrama, but little else.",1485648000,,1737,5.076923076923077
8017547,5,B0001XALBE,"This DVD is not something I would normally think of buying, particularly with that title, but when I found out that it had been directed by Roberto Gavaldon, one of my favorite Mexican film noir directors, I was intrigued. The title sounded like a silly comedy, well it is not. It stars Yolanda Montez (aka ""Tongolele""), tough guy leading man, David Silva, and up and coming femme fatale, Lilia Prado (an ingenue here). Montez was one of several ""rumberas"" in Mexican flicks from the 40's and early 50's. More than an actress she was known for her spectacular figure and her talents for dancing a mean mambo in very skimpy attire. In this film she does not dissappoint. She stars in several musical numbers as the murder plot unfolds around her during an evening performance at a variety theater. I will not go into details: roughly, there is a murder and the culprit is eventually caught. All the Roberto Gavaldon film noir touches are here - imagine ""Gilda"" Mexican style, but blunter: a heroin hypodermic is featured nonchalantly, and there's also full figure nudity through an opaque dressing room screen, though you can see enough - Hollywood censors would have never let this pass in those days! There are also numerous entertaining musical acts and routines onstage as the plot unfolds backstage. A fun film if you like b&w murder mysteries from the 40's. And La Togolele (as opposed to La Montez - that was Maria!) ain't bad to look at either (sort of a brunette Anita Ekberg, as seen in ""Zarak""). Though there are no English subtitles or extras, the print is quite good, and at current prices, a bargain.",1306281600,3,1613,4.7437722419928825
