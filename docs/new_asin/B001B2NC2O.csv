8281539,2,B001B2NC2O,"I was very disappointed in this video, and once I bought it, I was surprised to recall the positive reviews.  I found it to be almost useless as a way to learn a tai chi form. I've taken tai chi and chi gong classes in the past, and I've benefited greatly from Lee Holden's superbly done set, ""Qi Gong for Health and Healing"" -- a set I HIGHLY recommend, by the way for its well-planned DVDs, as well as audio CDs and an excellent book, all for about $100. But I'd bought Dr. Yang's DVD, pricey though it is for just ONE DVD, thinking that this would be some super-charged way to increase my energy levels/health/etc. -- basically believing the advertising.
But the demos are terrible.  Dr. Yang has his not-very-skilled students illustrating the postures and movements, and they're so stiff and wooden that it's painful to watch them. Two of them stand facing the camera with their arms held out and down to their sides -- clearly not relaxed -- looking like they're about to draw a 6-shooter from a holster.  And even when Dr. Yang does the demos  himself, they're hard to learn from because, unlike Lee Holden, Yang doesn't bother doing the moves as though we're looking into a mirror, so it's hard to look at him turning to HIS right when we're directed to turn to OUR left.  (Believe me, if you try Lee Holden's videos, you'll see how much difference learning from the mirror view makes.)  Then Yang does each move with his back to us so that when he turns to the left, e.g., we also turn to the left, which is OK (though the shots are a bit too distant), but he even does this when the only movements are with the hands(!), so we only see his back with his shoulders slightly moving and can't see what he's doing with  his arms, wrists, and hands!  Oy.  I'm giving this DVD 2 stars rather than one only because I'm sure he knows how to do the forms well, and his voice is pleasant, but if you want to learn how to do the tai chi and chi kung practices he recommends, good luck.  Maybe it'd be ok if you already know his specific routines, but for beginners (and I'm even a bit beyond the total beginner stage), forget it.",1509753600,2,2127,4.348484848484849
8281540,5,B001B2NC2O,One of the more comprehensive DVD's I have seen to date regarding Tai Chi.  The instructional part is outstanding.,1499731200,2,114,5.0
8281541,5,B001B2NC2O,I am a student of qigong and tai chi.  This is a wonderful DVD.  Dr. Yang goes into great detail about the individual movements.  The program is very easy to use.,1359936000,15,162,4.161290322580645
8281542,5,B001B2NC2O,"I have been doing Taijiquan for over 20 years and have a library full of wonderful Taiji tapes and DVDs.  But this one is better than all of them.  Why?
1.  It is based on solid medical research and has evidence that demonstrates that it works for health.
2.  It is an easy enough form that anyone can do it - while still based in the Chen style, a very martial type of Taijiquan that has strong foundations in the self defense aspects of the art.
3.  Laoshi Yang's instructions are extremely detailed, easy to follow, and complete.
4.  Both forward and backward views, so you can follow the form as if he is in front of you, or you can see him from the front, so you can see everything the is doing.
5.  The DVD doesn't try to do too much.  It is over 4 hours of instruction, but it sticks to the simple most healthful and efficient exercises.

Once you've learned the form and the qigong exercises he introduces in this DVD, you will be able to do them all every day in just a few minutes - but the health benefits will accumulate and last for decades.",1297900800,41,1054,4.203980099502488
