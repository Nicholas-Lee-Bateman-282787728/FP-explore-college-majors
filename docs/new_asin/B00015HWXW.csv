1971958,3,B00015HWXW,"Great artwork and packaging mask yet another poverty row horror effort.  ""SICK"" has the interesting premise of a fat psycho clown terrorizing some uninteresting characters out in the woods.  Pretty standard plot, but hey... the killer Bozo is a nice touch!
As bad as this movie seems on the surface, there's just something about it that I like.  There's an uneasy tension throughout the film that makes the viewer actually care about what's going to happen next.  Also there's a surprise ending that I didn't see coming.
Adventurous viewers may want to check ""SICK"" out.  It does, at the very least, live up to it's title.",1079568000,,622,4.830188679245283

It is extremely funny!!  A friend who I watched this with actually wants to spend movie buying a copy of this flick..  That is saying something.  We usually watch 3 horror movies a week.  The lead actor is hysterical and seems to have graduated from the Keanu Reeves school of Acting.  Some of his lines will stay with me for a long time...  There is another character who reminds me of a ""Bruce Campbell"" wanna-be type.  It was a really fun movie but seemed a little long in the telling of the story.

1971962,3,B00015HWXW,When I first saw this movie it was pretty predictable on what was goona happen. It's about a few friends sitting around a campfire telling stories. One girl says she has a great idea for a horror movie. It's about a clown who is sent to entertain a little girl. The parents leave her alone and when they return the girl is gone. The men of the town take the clown into the woods and beat him. After the story the real clown comes and starts hacking people off. You get the picture. The effects are good ....

1971963,1,B00015HWXW,"If you feel like a horror movie, but don't want to worry about a storyline and plot, this may be the movie for you. I actually had to go back to understand who the ""stars"" of the movie were; they didn't really explain where most of them came from, plus they all looked like the same person.
This low-budget looking film was a disgrace to horror films of any generation. Just think about it... you watch a movie with a great looking title and coverbox, and get a dud. You don't even see the killer until close to the end of the movie. It was just another amateur flick that wanted to get young viewers to see women sleep with everyone in the movie within a 5 minute span.
Again, don't even waste your time in watching this movie. It's one of the worst movies I've seen since ""Dumb and Dumberer"" and ""The Scheme"" (featuring Jimmy Fallon).",1076630400,2,836,4.3312101910828025

1971995,4,B00015HWXW,"Okay, okay, so this thing was shot on a shoestring budget, the acting is horrendous, and the dialogue is ridiculous...  Now that that's out of the way, there are many, many gems to be found for a lover of B horror:

1.)The name: S.I.C.K (Serial Insane Clown Killer).  Not grammatically correct-sounding, but I thought it was pretty clever -- much better than the original title of Grim Weekend, anyway.

2.)The premise: Group of friends (who ironically don't seem to know much about each other) go to cabin in the middle of the woods for a weekend.  It's so campy and predictable I can't help but adore it.  Other classic elements: campfire stories, drug use, sex, serial killer.

3.)The clown: I loathe clowns; they creep me out.  This movie has a clown mask in it, and so, in the midst of my tears of laughter, I was still a little on edge every time they showed the creepy killer clown man. Also: baby dolls.

4.)The actors playing Brandon and Denise (lead actor and a hitchhiker picked up to share the weekend festivities).  These two are the only ones who seem to put any effort into their performances, with hilarious, over-the-top results.

5.)The surreal flashback sequences: I'm half-thinking they did these to imply that everyone in the movie is on some pretty strong drugs, and therefore it is only right they should remember things as a blur of color and pop beats.

6.)The ending: Assuming you make it all the way through this thing, it's well worth it.  I promise. Really.

Verdict: So bad it is a masterpiece.",1319760000,,1524,4.680451127819549

1972010,2,B00015HWXW,"PLOT

A group of friends plan a weekend trip to remote cabin in the woods. After they stop for beer and pick up a hitchhiker they drive to the desolate spot and start to party. Gathered around a campfire, the hitchhiker girl tells a story of a deranged cannibal clown killer. From that point on weird things start to happen and she becomes a suspect. When one of them come up missing, and no fingers point to her, they start to worry and wonder who is behind it all. When it becomes apparent that the story was more than a myth, and things are really happening the way the hitchhiker told, the real story comes out in a twist ending that makes everything make sense.

Since I am a fan of (even very low budget) woods/camp slasher movies, I really wanted to check this out. It was a typical woods slasher-- nothing new here. We had sex, drugs, boobs and the over-used campfire scene. We had one pretty okay kill (a decapitation) and a pretty alright story behind the movie. The killer was big and intimidating, but that was about it. The location of the movie was great. One of the very few low-budget woods slashers that actually take place in a real cabin, and not in a tent in the woods. That being said, I really enjoyed the location and scenery. Finally, I must admit that the ending really surprised me, and I thought it made the movie worthwhile for me.

Well, the movie had some really pungent acting. The girls were all pretty cute, but only 2 were unclothed. The gore, being very skimpy to begin with wasn't very well done. The only kill in the movie (well, onscreen kill) other than the death in the opening pre-credit scene was a head decapitation, which looked alright, but still wasn't very well done. The movie lacked kills and action. Most of the movie was the gang just hanging out, talking, arguing, getting high, or looking for their lost friend. The cast also kept mentioning the obvious-- to let us know they were not within range of getting help. ""Cell phones don't work"", We're 12 miles from civilization..."". I mean, c'mon, it's a slasher movie, we should already presume all of this. Lastly, why always a clown mask? Okay, we all get it. Some people are terrified of clowns, but it has already been done and it didn't work then. I just thought it was lame.

I read a review of this movie in Fangoria, and I tell you I really never wanted to ever watch it. After having a few friends watch it and they said it was actually not bad, and on the same level as Camp Blood, Camp Utopia and Memorial Day,I figured I should check it out. All I could really think about was a rip-off of Camp Blood, which it was, and that movie was not very good at all. The opening scene wasn't very good, and the movie was shot on video, which gives that distinct ""home video"" look. That, itself wasn't too inviting. The lady was killed, and ""Food"" was wrote across her forehead, and the killer put clown make-up on her. That scene reminded me of the scene in Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, when Leatherface was using that hand-held spelling game and a picture of a clown kept coming up, and he kept typing in ""FOOD"" and kept getting it wrong. I am quite sure it was ripped straight from that. Anyways, the movie was pretty slow in a lot of places, and the ending, even though I thought it was pretty alright really fell flat. I would recommend this movie to people who are a fan of low-budget movies, camp/woods slashers, and movies like Bloody Murder, Camp Blood, Camp Utopia and such. Otherwise, stay away from this.",1142121600,3,3517,4.439628482972136
1972011,5,B00015HWXW,"Some films, the latest embarassments from Uwe Boll and Paul Anderson being prime examples, are so boldly terrible they actively defy any room for enjoyment or praise.  Others, like the Super Mario Bros. adaptation, are surreal and inexplicable enough to defy their nonsensical scripts.  S.I.C.K. is built on the C-Horror movie gaudiness of the former batch but redeemed by the absurdist brilliance of the latter.

What makes S.I.C.K. such a wonderful piece of art is the sheer magnitude of the director's incompetance.  It's almost as if a space alien came down to earth, watched a batch of terrible softcore porns and cheesy indie slasher flicks, and set out to make a culmination of the two absolutely devoid of either genre's charms.  The shots linger too long, random scenes jump out of nowhere.  The dialogue and acting is absolutely unparalleled in its awesome banality, and that's coming from soemone who sat through the duration of Dracula 3000.  The guy who played the character who owns the cabin should win some sort of Oscar in film-Hell.

All of which adds up to an entertaining sort of cinematic tragedy, something like a gory pileup involving a clown-car from the circus.  If you can sit through the ridiculously drawn out shot of the car driving down the road or the search-for-the-lost-friend-in-the-woods in its bizzare entirety without being put in stitches, there is something wrong with your head.",1139184000,3,1418,5.051502145922747

Awesome cover art to lure fools like us to rent or buy..but very misleading.

First of all we have a handful of talent here:

1. Jason Bateman

2. Bruce Campbell

3. Amy fischer

4.and Chelsea Clinton

Tell me these unknown actors didn't look like your favorite celebrities?!?

The so called ""Clown killings"" were very minimum (he killed 2 people what a body count!!!)

The whole ""Cabin fever"" ""Evil Dead"" atmosphere didn't seem to work. The actors sounded like they were rehearsing their lines especially the ""Bruce Campbell"" look-alike dude.

The gore scenes with the raw body parts lying all over the place looked like a someone just went ""buckwild"" throwing meat all over the place.

Everything was laughable. I found it strange that the killer Clown who by the way is BIG as a house couldn't knock down the front door to get inside?

The whole dolls around the house, ie ""the doll in the bed with the pants and shirt, the barbie dolls lying around near the tree was STUPIDDD!!!

It took away from the ""Clown theme"" and just made the movie seem like it didn't know what direction this was going in.

The ending was PREDICTABLE.

We saw it a mile away.

By the way, what the hell was up with the picture quality???

It looked like a VHS-DVD transfer or something..we actually was if it needed an antennae.

1972032,5,B00015HWXW,"This film is true independent filmmaking.  Along with Troma.  This film is about a group of friends going up to one's cabin for the weekend.  At a bar, they pick up a woman, very attractive if I might say, and take her with them.  After a night of screwin', everyone gets laid!, one of them disappears.  It's fun to watch them blame eachother through the whole thing, it shows that they're only human.  Unlike some people who immediately jump to conclusions about the killers.  That's fun too, though.  Like FvJ.  They jumped to conclusions pretty quick, only 'cuz they had to trim the script to an hour and a half.  It's still the best movie ever! (FvJ I mean)  S.I.C.K. offers the fact that a killer clown cannibal lives in the woods, waiting for his next snacks/victims.  I wouldn't even suggest a clown is in the woods killing my friends.  Maybe now I will.  The movie is slow at times, but gives you sex, very hysterical dialogue if most people actually listen to it instead of fast forwarding, and also a clown who is very, very sick.  I saw the trailer of this on House of the Dead VHS after I rented it, but the store didn't have this.  The picture quality is genius, because most movies have people so lit up, you can see their expressions, even though they don't know where everyone else is.  It is very dark, like the movie.  It also made me wonder if the clown was hidden in the background, watching.  A common complaint is that the clown is seen putting on his make-up, but in the movie actually has a mask on.  It's 'cuz the clown was depicted in the story like a party clown, but in the movie, he is a cannibal who wears a clown mask.  The film builds up to the conclusion, which I suspected some of it, but there is one bit that I didn't even conceive.  The movie is not laden with gore, but is still pretty good when you actually see it.  The movie is worth renting, even if you don't like it, please fast forward to the end.  The end alone is worth a look.  My sister bought me a copy at a video store during it's sale of over 1000 titles, which was pretty much depleted!  There was only one copy, and I didn't see any left on the rental shelf either.  I think it was worth it because the movie is fun to watch.  Artisan is the only company taking big risks on horror films lately.  House of the Dead, S.I.C.K., and Cutthroat Alley (which I wanna see).  All of the other companies are going with the sure-things.  I love almost every horror movie I've ever seen.  The only one I hated was the Ring.  I call it a comedy.  I like mainstream horror, indie horror, and also the shoe-string budget horror.  I can only hope to make a movie that would get major distribution, but if I make one, I'm sending it to Artisan.  They might release it.  At least rent this because it's not just a sweet, super SWEET movie cover.  It's actually really creepy.  I will never think of Ring Around the Rosie the same way again.",1093219200,,2927,4.291208791208791
1972033,1,B00015HWXW,"This movie actually deserved a zero but Amazon doesn't allow it.  As a comedy, it's hillarious, but as a horror, it's horrible.  The quality is bad, the acting is bad, the effects are bad, the movie is worse.  Plot :  Some guy you'll wish to be killed invites some people up to a cabin.  A clown begins to kill everybody and it ends with an obvious twist.  One of my favorite scenes is when one of the men goes in the woods to look for his missing wife.  One of the other woman offers to help.  The man continues to say he loves his wife (who is hot) and almost has a nervous breakdown until he has sex with the woman helping him.  WTF?  Here's the best part, after they're done, the man insists they keep looking.  Wow.",1093219200,,720,4.144927536231884

1972047,1,B00015HWXW,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. I thought that the 1980's film TWISTED NIGHTMARE was a horrible, Friday the 13th rip-off. I was dead wrong. TWISTED NIGHTMARE is a classic compared to this piece of garbage. A bunch of bimbo people go up to a friend's cabin for a week and are stalked by a psycho clown. The plot goes nowhere, the acting is beyond unbearable and there is absolutely no suspense. There is some chilling moments involving the clown, but that's mostly confined to the last few minutes of the film, and even those minutes aren't that good. I heard this was bad before I rented it, but man-o-man, did I waste my money and time. This goes beyond the limits of a bad movie. The sex scenes are laughable and the music score sounds worse than MIDI files (if that's possible!).",1089763200,,799,4.405405405405405
1972048,1,B00015HWXW,"This movie is a perfect example of what people in the straight to home video movie companies refer to as ""traps""
Let me explain...Believe it or not, there aren't enough new movies coming out to fill the needs of everyone and let's face it, we can't keep on watching the same movies all the time. So producers make up fast stripts, compile some no name actors that don't ask for alot of money in exchange that they can be seen for future projects, get a washed up director or someone out of film school that scored high in their term papers, and last but the most important..get a great artist to design the cover art.
That being said, it's sad that it has come to this but it has, generally this happens to us (the horror fans) and we have no way to stop it. Remember the saying ""Don't judge a book but it's cover"", well here's a perfect example....We do because it looks tempting, i mean..a clown, the woods, horror, references to the TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, Wow..how can we go wrong renting or buying this movie? Well, for one thing..less money in your pockets and more to the people that do this films.
Let's forget about that and focus on problems with the movie..poor acting, poor camera work, gore factor from one to ten is 1 (i'll give them the beheading part in the movie), and where's the clown?(you actually see him maybe ten minutes in the whole movie) and last but no least terrible plot. I can even say this is a ""so bad it's good"" movie cause it's not, it actually makes fun of people who love this genre.
I've noticed that the some reviews were positive (3 stars and more) and i'm not surprized, everyone's got there own way of looking at a film but the good reviews were because they found the film very funny or something to laugh at with a bunch of friends but NOT FOR THE HORROR CONTENT!
Last, i'm not a film student or an actor just a concerned guy who likes watching movies, from comedies to drama to b-movies but movies i hate are ones like this that are plain and simple garbage!
STOP THE INSANITY!!! JOIN ME AND STOP THESE FILMS FROM BEING MADE!! (on second thought, forget about it..there's nothing we can do!)
NOTE: wanna check out another movie of this caliber? Check out ""HALLOWS END"" on DVD...another S.I.C.K movie award winner!",1089072000,2,2258,4.456521739130435
1972049,5,B00015HWXW,"I always like renting horrors cause they generally result in 1 of 2 types of enjoyment: sometimes they-re genuinely scary but more often display ridiculous lapse in judgement and are ""so-bad-their-good"" because they become comedies. Either way, I end up entertained and fulfilled. I thought there were alot of people like me, but apparently not seeing as how everyone crucified this movie. Its so unoriginal, illogical, inconceivable and bush-league in so many ways that this movie goes down in my books as having tremendous comedic value. Honestly people, what did you expect to get when you saw this at the video store? An oscar-worthy straight-to-video tale about a clown that kills people? If you were literally ""disappointed"" then your expections are out of sync with reality. I expected a stupid and funny horror movie, and what I got was a priceless gem.
P.S.... make sure to remind yourself habitually throughout the viewing of this movie the following: A)these are professional actors, writers and crew (i.e. they presummably think they have something to offer the world of cinema), B) someone out there read this screenplay and decided to invest in the production WITH ACTUAL REAL $ that could have been invested elsewhere and C) Blockbuster dignifies this ridiculous movie with a spot on the shelf at video store.
  Bearing in mind these points will most certainly add to your enjoyement. I can't believe blockbuster lacks some sort of a filter for movies of this calibre, but I'm sure gldd they don't cause otherwise we might have missed out!",1087084800,2,1554,5.042801556420233

I don't know what I was thinking but I bought this movie. Perhaps it was because of the title and artwork that made it look so great. This is not my first dissapointment with horror movies, but it certainly is the greatest. The clown hardly makes any appearence, the gore is totally zero, and the characters are stupid. I consider this film to be very disrespectful toward those true horror fans like me. My warning : buy it only because you liked the artwork...",1085529600,,615,4.220338983050848
1972051,1,B00015HWXW,"Oh how bad this was. Bad doesn't even come close to describing this bomb. It has no horror, except maybe for a very tame beheading scene and the stabbing before the credits. The sex scenes are lame, the acting is DEPLORABLE. The 'star' who's charactor's name is Brandon has this matter-of-factly, drawl that he uses throughout the film. It really gets on your nerves after awhile. It's like he's constantly talking to five year olds.
The clown on the cover looks pretty cool, too bad he's not in the movie. The 'monster' in the movie is 300 lbs. of sweat and flab. He's barely in the movie. You get more scenes with the mask on the camera as the viewer looks out the eyeholes.
Surprise twist ending? Yeah right. After the campfire scene, it's pretty much a no brainer.
If you see this film for 99 cents in a super bargain bin, pass it up. The only thing good I can say about this movie is that it didn't have Pauly Shore.",1085443200,,921,4.3604651162790695

For those who are even condisering renting this movie, only rent it if you really want to laugh. The tag line reads, ""Unlike other horror movies, this is really, REALLY, Scary."" That's bull. This movie is very predictable, and has been made before. Ever seen Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This is it, but with a clown.
You've been warned.",1083369600,,494,4.823529411764706
1972053,2,B00015HWXW,"OMG! This movie is hilarious...But don't buy it, spend a couple of bucks and rent it if you want a fun evening of hilarity.
When I rented this movie-I expected a low budget movie about a killer clown-I expected ""not up to par"" acting and so-so special effects...what I didn't bargain for was the laugh factor.
The lead actor who played Brandon,(I didn't bother to learn his real name from the credits.)couldn't act his way out of a paper bag!! Yep this guy has a lot of raw talent,(eyes rolling up with sarcasm) I get more emotion from my oak tree out front.
The other lead male character, I think his name was Mark, he was doing his best ""Bruce Campbell"" impersonation throughout the whole movie, he had Bruce's facial expressions down pat, had me convinced they were related by the end of the movie.
That is about all he convinced me of. His wife was lost in the woods, all these weird, mutilated ""dolls"" are all over the place, and he is supposed to be worried about his wife, but still has sex with the ""ho"" character while doing said search for his missing wife---yeah, I feel sexy when my spouse is missing too---!!!
The ""ho"" role played by the character of Denise, is the most believeable character out of the bunch so far, and that is not really saying much. But she can act a little, she can always do pornos if the movie thing doesn't work out for her...and with S.I.C.K. under her belt, hey, the sky's the limit, Baby!!
The love object of lead character Brandon, is the lovely Tracey, who also had drama lessons from 'Mono-tone, Bad Acting University'!
She is the one who helps the ""Ho"" out when she is being threated by a local, then she is the one who thinks Denise is behind everything, then she trusts her, then she thinks she is behind everything, ....etc!
Enter the wife of Mark, can't remember her character's name, she wasn't in it too long(and she tends to ""lose her head"" when trying to act). She is also a bad actress, but she does a good ""getting high"" scene with the Bruce Campbell wanna be.
Entrance stage left Bozo on thorazine...OMG...the ""killer clown"" is a scream. How is a clown scary during the day time? When he has an ax...oh and big clown shoes..those are pretty damn scary if you ask me.
The director of this better be ready for that call from the academy, I bet this gets nominated for an oscar...An Oscar Myer Hotdog Weiner!!! Cause you need lots of mustard to chase this movie's bad taste in your mouth...
But the funny factor it is worth the two stars.
And the ending is pretty damn decent considering the 2 hours of my life that was lost to see the damn thing. Really, you don't see this one coming, it is not obvious.
So, when my dog Sparky gets his camcorder back from the repair shop, we are going to finish our movie too...Sparky is directing, and we think we have a hit.
IT is called ""S.I.C.K. To My Stomach II-Revenge of the Intestines in the Clown Shack""! See it, it promises to be better than this crap.

Picture Quality
The aspect ratio is 4/3 (or 1.33/1), so there will more than likely be large black bars on the side of your screen. Also, as another reviewer pointed out, it looks as if this DVD is a poor rip from a V.H.S. tape.
