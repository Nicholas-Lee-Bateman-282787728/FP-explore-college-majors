7883641,5,6305132194,"One of my favorite Lamas flicks. (and I own a lot of them) The story line is fairly descent, the action scenes are in my opinion pretty darn good.  I liked that you got to see a softer side of Lamas as well, in a family man setting.  At times the acting is a little on the cheesey side, but still worth the watch in my opinion :)",1323129600,,329,3.823529411764706
7883642,4,6305132194,I really enjoyed this movie made from Jack Higgins's book. I have read several of his books and have enjoyed all of them. It was interesting to see how the movie protrayed the characters from the books. The story line and action was good.,1302739200,,238,4.431818181818182
7883643,1,6305132194,"Casting Rob Lowe as Irishman Sean Dillon may be one of the biggest casting gaffs in film history....To readers of Higgins who are acquainted with the Dillon character, this casting will prove to be a disaster....a profoundly poor choice....he just doesn't measure up in the role due to being American and also appearing as a wimp....There are a number of British/Irish/Scottish actors who could have played this part very well.....",1270944000,,431,5.171428571428572
7883644,2,6305132194,"An attempt is made to transfer too large a segment of Jack Higgins' espionage novel to film in this tale of former IRA comrades who find themselves upon opposing sides during a royalty-targeted assassination plan, since the lengthy book is replete with sub-plots, and with a wide range of characters who need cinematic development in order to engage a viewer's concern. One's first impression is that nearly every role is miscast and although some certainly are, it quickly becomes apparent that weak direction by Lawrence Gordon-Clark gives little hope to the players as to what their interpretations might be; a good amount of intensity by the cast seems wasted in scenes that lack signification. Rob Lowe as an IRA hitman should probably have been able to collect some type of Irish lilt during his life, and it is ironic that his rival, played by the charismatic German, Hannes Jaenicke, speaks English with only a slight accent, although he also wants a Hibernian brogue.",1126051200,5,976,4.993865030674846
7883645,4,6305132194,A great storyline idea by Jack Higgins. This thriller concentrates on the relationships between the leading characters. This is at its very best when Su Yin (played by Daphne Cheung) illuminates the screen with her presence.  This is a must see movie for Miss Cheung's contribution alone. Kenneth  Cranham (Respected British stage and TV actor) also makes a valuable  contribution to this very watchable film.,944092800,8,409,5.2615384615384615
