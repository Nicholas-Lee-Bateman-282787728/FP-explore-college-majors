The Christmas special that is on it is whrn Mary can`t go home for Christmas Day because she has to work in the news room requested by Mr Grant. Then it even gets worse when she has to work on Christmas Eve Night because she takes this jerk`s place who has to work then. The funniest is when she is working in the news room all by herself and singing with the television. Don`t wnat to spoil the ending but it is a pure Christmas classic. It also has a bonus episode on it,the one when Mary is offered another job that pays more money than at the job she already loves. She decides to take the job and than the boys decide to throw her a going away party. The part mostly upsets her with her hilarious crying act. At the mr Grant decides to give her a raise and she decides to stay. This is a really great tape at a great price. If you want to laugh buy it.",1166140800,,1009,3.950980392156863

Although we were able to replace the broken part by completely pulling it apart and replacing it with the part off of one of ours, the beyond poor quality of the resulting film copy was not worth the effort we went through to fix it. It looks as though we cannot return it either......too bad. Buy the newly released M.T.M Dvds instead, they are excellent and worth the extra cash. Long live Mary Tyler Moore, Right Girls?",1123113600,,476,4.6117647058823525
