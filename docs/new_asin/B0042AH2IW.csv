8413371,1,B0042AH2IW,"As a HUGE Lady Gaga fan, I collect everything related to her... and even though there are some good unofficial documentaries out there, like One Sequin At A Time and Glamourpuss, this is HORRIBLE.  It's short, the interviews with irrelevant people are boring, and there is nothing new REVEALED, as the title suggests.  I've only watched it once and felt like I threw my money down the toilet... it's there collecting dust in my DVD collection.  Stay way!",1306195200,,454,4.794871794871795
8413372,2,B0042AH2IW,"Not good! The information is very basic information any Lady Gaga fan already knows, plus it's so poorly made it looks like a twelve year old made it. If you are going to pay for this, make $3 your limit.",1293062400,3,204,4.125
