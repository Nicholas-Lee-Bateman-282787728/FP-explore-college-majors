8277093,4,B001AD1NB6,Pretty decent telling of the whole battle of Troy saga.  Gordon Mitchell makes a fine Achilles.  Plenty of swordplay and one of the better sword and sandal entries.,1403913600,2,164,4.821428571428571

8277095,4,B001AD1NB6,"I watched this film on a low-quality video transfer made for a large anthology of sword and sandal films, not this particular edition, so I can't speak for the quality of the transfer here, though I'm betting Sinister Cinema did a much better job than Mill Creek. But it wasn't the cinemtography that blew me away when I watched it. Gordon Mitchell does a great job of presenting Achilles as a tragic figure, who knows he will die in the Trojan War but also that he cannot stay out of it. This Achilles is so much more than the mindless bully boy of ""Troy"" though I don't really hold that against Brad Pitt ... the writing in ""Fury of Achilles"" is just miles ahead of the writing in Troy. There's a definite bitter edge to the fury of Achilles in this movie, a man who, because he knows he personally is doomed, can clearly see the folly and vainglory of those around him, even as the machinery of war drags them all in its dreadful path. Check it out!",1307923200,3,952,4.324022346368715
