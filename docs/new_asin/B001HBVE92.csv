3628780,5,B001HBVE92,"The idea in itself to let a drunk leprechaun play one of the leads is brilliant. That he can't even count the wishes he is suppose to grant or remember his spells only adds to the fun.

The story is in the same spirit as ""Revenge of the Nerds"" and Bill the towelboy falls for Krissi the cheerleader. In his way stands Krissi's mom, the jocks and society itself.

Classic scenes include a tennis racket being inserted in someone's rectum and Bill being shrunken and ending up inside Krissi's panties.

This movie was played on TV back in the day and then lost for what seemed to be forever. But the Troma team are reviving it and giving it the release it deserves.

Special features include a hilarious and informative story about the making of Getting Lucky from writer/director Michael Paul Girard.

Enjoy!",1225238400,21,807,4.615384615384615

3628787,1,B001HBVE92,"Some movies are so bad, they're good.  This one is so bad...................it's abominable. It's the perfect storm of terrible acting, cringe-worthy cinematography, and really poor writing.  And, did I mention the terrible acting?  I assume this was some kid's high school film project.  As such, I guess it's not a bad little effort.  If somebody was really trying to make a movie, though, that's a shame.

I should mention a couple of pluses:  the story nicely adheres to some traditional morality, and (out of nowhere) the film includes a horseback mounted barbarian.  For what purpose, you ask?  I have no idea, but it seemed funny at the time.  All that can be said of this film is that you will pass 90 minutes of your life without having to think too hard.  It was probably perfect for late night TV in the dorms.",1461888000,,821,4.671328671328672

3628794,2,B001HBVE92,"I just watched the dang Troma movie Getting Lucky. And while we're on the dang subject of luck, let me say that I ain't got any. My dang toilet won't flush, we have a dang pest problem in our house, and I ain't been laid in a few dang months. And I have a dang bladder problem. I had to urinate two dang times just while watching this crappy movie! Getting Lucky is from Troma, of course. I've been a dang Troma fan since Justin Bieber was in dang diapers. Sure a lot of the dang movies they put out are crap, but I loved that dang Poultrygeist movie and a few of the dang Toxic Avenger movies. And Tales From The Crapper starring that dang sexy broad, Julie Strain. However, I did not love Getting Lucky. It's not very dang funny, and there isn't a whole lot of dang nudity for a teen sex comedy. Heck, I've seen more dang nudity in a hemorrhoid cream commercial. The dang bottom line is you ain't getting lucky if you're watching this dang movie.",1330819200,2,948,4.214285714285714
3628795,5,B001HBVE92,"I watch a lot of low budget movies -- the kind that are so bad they're good.  Sometimes it's as much fun to chuckle at the bad acting, cheap sets and gaping plot holes as it is to watch a movie with a huge budget and great effects.  There are a few low budget pics that are enjoyable beyond the cheese factor.  Getting Lucky is one of these.

To sum up the plot, nerdy Bill wants to save the environment, make enough cash to go to college and date a hot cheerleader.  When he finds an alcoholic leprechaun in a beer bottle while recycling all his dreams start to come together.  Kind of.  Mostly.  In a round about way.  The plot runs from the absurd to the banal.  Plenty of jokes were more relevant when this movie was made, but that's to be expected.  It's funny enough to keep the viewers interest.

What's great about Getting Lucky is that there's more to it than just jokes about trying to get into a cheerleader's pants.  Yes, this is a sex comedy, with very little nudity, and some seriously funny scenes.  The ending has to be seen to be believed.  Getting Lucky is one of my favorite low budget flicks ever.  If you're a B movie fan, you won't be disappointed.",1325030400,2,1170,4.273972602739726
3628796,4,B001HBVE92,"I saw this movie about 10+ years ago when it was shown at about 3 AM on a local TV station. I though it was pretty funny and was only a little mad for not firing up the VCR after about 10 minutes. I only wish they had released this on DVD sooner. I saw that it had been remade and a new cast and all, do not get the remake. This is the one to get. Very funny about a drunk leprechaun and how he tries to grant three correct wishes and gets it wrong. Wish I could have found a drunk leprechaun in a bottle in High School.....could have been a fun time. Buy this movie and get ""Cheerleader Ninja's"" while you are at it.

3628798,1,B001HBVE92,"This is my first review on Amazon and I can't believe it is for Getting Lucky. God help me! I bought this film with the hopes of getting a fun 80s sex-comedy romp and instead watched a piss-poor film that I forced myself to finish just so that I could attempt to write a comprehensive review. Well, this film hardly deserved it. I'd like to clarify my position before I go further: I consider myself a cult film fanatic and truly appreciate low-budget affairs. It's always a pleasure to watch a film with a limited budget that forces filmmakers to rely on creative filmmaking and subversive/exploitive themes. This film, however, lacked any of the aformentioned redeeming qualities--believe me, I wanted to find at least one after spending money on this DVD.

[...] An utter sham and totally misleading. I wasted my Saturday afternoon and will have to be more careful when reading reviews by Amazon customers in the future. The Troma label should have been a warning to steer clear of this title, but I was willing to give this a chance as I'm by no means an expert of this genre and was willing to put my faith in the reviews I read on this forum. I challenge any one who lacks childhood nostalgia or financial gain from the sale of this DVD to watch this DVD and objectively give it five stars.

I will give credit were it is due: There was one funny scene in this entire film, when the ""towel boy"" shrinks via the genie leprechaun and ends up in the panties of the lead actress. As she goes through her day, he clings for life by her pubic hair. That, I must admit, made me grin for a while. Otherwise, the content lacked any originality, unless you consider the genie leprechaun (incredibly disappointing effort here IMO) that interesting. From a filmmaking standpoint, this film was horribly produced, lacked any sense of style, displayed horribly unimaginative cinematography, and sounded like you were listening out of a tin can. Lets just say this was Amateurish (notice the capital A): I witnessed far better production values in my introduction to filmmaking class at USC as an UNDERGRAD!

If this isn't enough, Troma interferes with their typically shameless self-promotion (see Lloyd Kaufman's ""introduciton"" to the film).  Additionally, the DVD boasts extra features which are actually quite poor as even a self-proclaimed cinephile like myself finds little reasons to watch a photo gallery with narration provided by the film's boom operator/still photographer.  I mean, really?).  All this ingredients make for a delicious C-R-A-P sandwich, so by all means eat up if you're into that sort of thing. Watch at your own risk but if you choose to see this thing, please provide an objective review to balance the overall rating this film has received.  There's no need for others to feel as mislead and pissed off as I do right now.",1250899200,12,2843,4.778004073319756
3628799,5,B001HBVE92,"If you're a fan of such classics as ""Revenge of the Nerds"" and ""Weird Science"", ""Getting Lucky"" will be right up your alley.  It's classic nerd-getting-his-day sort of film that pulls out all the stops and does not fail to entertain.

This film is very much along the same lines as ""Zapped"" and ""Revenge of the Nerds"" with a 90's twist. And the scene where he shrinks and he's in the girl's underwear is a classic scene that sticks in my memory to this day.",1245196800,12,400,4.075949367088608

8308528,1,B001HBVE92,"This might have been a really good movie if the company who made it would have had hired a professional cinematographer. Gerry Williams aka Gerald Williams or also known as Gerald M. Williams from the ""mars movie guide"" was the cinematographer on this film. I showed this to my father who has been a cinematographer for over fifty years with major notable films under his belt, he laughed! Any beginning cinematographer in the business can see the armature cinematography work all over this movie. The directing was a good attempt and the actors tried to make it look good but even they could only do so much with the awful cinematography! I have seen other movies Gerald has done seeing little to no improvement in skill. Having access to a camera doesnt make you a professional if you have no skill or creative style, which I see none. I give credit to the hard working actors and director of this movie; I see professionalism in them giving them all a 5 stars.
