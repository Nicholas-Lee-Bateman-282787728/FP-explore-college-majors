This movie didn't go directly to DVD, it went directly into the trash.  I was stupid enough to watch the entire thing expecting things to change.  This movie is horrible.  In good conscience I couldn't even give it one star.",1440720000,,340,4.694915254237288
8708509,3,B00UVCHWN0,"The film opens with a teaser scene that takes place 6 minutes from the end of the film. The town of Plainview is lucky enough to have a new casino, one that takes their money. Jake Rivers (Thomas Downey) is an honest hard working mechanic who helps out the town folk. He lives in a trailer with his wife Grace (Elisabeth Rhm) who works at the town diner and his sister Skye (Kayla Carlyle) who is a cocktail waitress at the casino.

When a rock from a casino construction truck breaks Jake's windshield, he visits the Casino manager (Vinnie Jones) which doesn't end well as the tit-for-tat escalates until we have an Ocean's 9 er ah River 9 caper.

This doesn't have the greatest plot or action. The attraction is the characters. Jamie Kennedy plays a half-wit. Leslie Easterbrook is a cougar. Neil Brown Jr. is another half-wit. Recommend as a rental

Guide: Sex. No real nudity. No F-bombs that I recall.",1439596800,,906,4.580246913580247

8708513,4,B00UVCHWN0,"For an independent release, this is higher quality production with an interesting cast that works well together. Vinnie Jones gives a strong and fun performance, Elizabeth Rhom is wonderful as always. I think the most interesting and comic like character would be the one played by Neil Brown Jr. Every scene he is in with Jamie Kennedy is unlike anything I have ever seen. At first I was not sure if I should be uncomfortable or laugh but ended up laughing because Neil is very funny and Jamie is...well it's Jamie Kennedy, he is often an awkward funny and this is no exception.

The film is an action crime comedy that feels like a throw back to a time when films were both fun and funny. A time when those elements mixed together were not the exception. There is action but it is not all blood, guts, gore and profanity, which is probably why it feels like a throw back to me.",1435795200,3,879,4.425925925925926
