8102240,5,B000CSTKKG,These DVD's were in very good condition.  I was very excited to watch this.  The DVD's came just before Christmas.,1391817600,,114,4.65
8102241,5,B000CSTKKG,"This is a 5-disc collection containing Pride 12-16(2000-2001). These were the years when Pride FC ruled the roost and was the premier MMA organization in the world. Fighters such as ""The Axe Murderer"", ""Rampage"", and ""Minotauro"" made their mark and became household names in Japan(and around the world).

The interesting thing about this era in Pride was that the rules weren't totally set yet and was constantly being tweaked from one event to the next(one example being knees to a grounded opponent). Of course Pride is legendary for allowing stomps and soccer kicks to a grounded opponent.

The fans in Japan are quiet during a fight and show knowledge of MMA techniques(they will patiently watch a grappling sequence and applaud if a fighter is able to gain favorable positioning). I love the respect they show to fighters. Each disc in this collection contains basically the same special features(photo gallery/highlights/History of Pride).",1358294400,,945,5.251655629139073

8102245,5,B000CSTKKG,"The events contained in this collection include Pride 12 through Pride 16. By this time, Pride Fighting had already moved light years ahead of where it had begun in terms of production and the magnitude of the events themselves.

In Pride 12, Guy Mezger wins, Heath Herring continues his winning ways and Carlos Newton wins decision. The highlight is Wanderlei Silva versus Dan Henderson. This is an amazing war with a great striking display. Very exciting! Ricco Rodriguez takes on John Marsh in a decent but uneventful fight that goes to a decision. Mark Kerr and Igor Vovchanchyn have their second Pride meeting. Kerr lies on top of Vovchanchyn, being able to barely squeak out a few takedowns. This time, the fight is ruled a draw and it goes to overtime. There is a final decision after the overtime round, but I won't spoil any of the GOOD fights for you. Kazushi Sakuraba takes out yet another Gracie (Ryan) by decision, continuing on his ""Gracie Hunting"" path.

In Pride 13, Vitor Belfort quickly submits Bobby Southworth and Guy Mezger wins again. Heath Herring continues to prove himself to be one of the most exciting fighters in Pride, as he immediately keylocks his opponent. Dan Henderson takes on Renzo Gracie and some people are shocked by just how good Henderson is. Mark Coleman KOs Allan Goes with vicious knees. Tra Telligman gets a somewhat shocking decision over Igor Vovchanchyn. Highlight is definitely the Wanderlei Silva v. Kazushi Sakuraba fight. Sakuraba had been cleaning up in Pride, winning much acclaim in Japan, but he was not ready for Silva. Wanderlei demolishes Sakuraba with strikes.

Pride 14:  This is where Pride becomes a huge event with all of the bells and whistles. Wanderlei Silva stops another opponent early in the first round (The Axe Murderer is one of the most entertaining fighers in the world of MMA).  Chuck ""The Iceman"" Liddell makes his Pride debut against Guy Mezger (UFC v. Pride). It's a standing battle and Mezger actually drops Liddell in the first round but, as you probably know if you watch the UFC, this is one of the highlight clips they show when they introduce Liddell... Chuck drops Mezger with a vicious right - and Mezger falls completely limp to the floor, awkwardly folding-up his left leg on the way down... Vitor Belfort and Heath Herring battle it out in a fight that could only be called decent... the decision at the end of the fight leaves people scratching their heads.

Pride 15: The best fight of this event has got to be the bout between Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson and Kazushi Sakuraba. Jackson repeatedly slams Sakuraba as Sakuraba attempts to secure submissions. Jackson actually slams his way out of submission holds. Sakuraba remains calm, as he is an outstanding warrior. This is an extremely entertaining fight to watch and we can all tell that we will be seeing much more of Rampage in the future. Another great fight from this event was Mark Kerr v. Heath Herring. Kerr lies on top of Herring for a while, as seems to be his practice, until Herring lands a huge kick and changes the flow of the fight. Pride 16: Ricardo Arona makes his debut against Guy Mezger and Don Frye makes his return against a thoroughly annoying Gilbert Yvel after 5 years of inactivity.

This set is where Pride really starts getting interesting. It is worth owning for the history, but also for the amazing action. Some true stars of mixed martial arts are established during these events. I definitely recommend it to fans of no holds barred fighting!",1149811200,6,3518,4.80495867768595
8102246,5,B000CSTKKG,"I haven't seen Legacy volumes 1 and 2, but I heard mixed reviews from fans. A lot of viewers were complaining that it was too boring. I'm a hardcore fan and all, but even I draw the line at some point. Well anyway, I was at Best Buy recently, and I saw the third volume for 20 bucks. I thought, ""What the heck,"" and picked it up.

I was surprised I actually enjoyed it. There are some dull matches and some really boring matches. Remember that at this time, Pride had three 10 minute rounds. So if the first round sucks, you have to endure another excruciating 20 minutes of ""laying and praying"" or ""locking and bolting."" However, the lame matches gradually dwindle and from Pride 14, it gets really exciting.

Here are some matches you might be interested in from each disc. There are more matches, but I'm only going to mention the ones that stand out or might interest you. Don't worry. There are no spoilers, although I do comment on each match.

DISC 1: PRIDE 12

Wanderlei Silva vs Dan Henderson - Wanderlei Silva is always exciting to watch.

Heath Herring vs Enson Inoue - This fight has you on the edge.

Kazushi Sakuraba vs Ryan Gracie - After Sakuraba disgraces the previously dominant Gracie family, Ryan steps up to avenge his fallen brothers.

DISC 2 - PRIDE 13

Wanderlei Silva vs Kazushi Sakuraba - Two of the best fighters collide and the outcome rocks the world of MMA.

Heath Herring vs Denis Sobolev - This is Herring's chance to show that he's a force in Pride, but the creepy-looking Sobolev begs to differ.

Vitor Belfort vs Bobby Southworth - Enter Vitor Belfort from the UFC and Bobby Southworth, the Omarosa of The Ultimate Fighter Season 1.

Tadao Yasuda vs Masaaki Satake - The referee who officiated this match should be fired. Otherwise if you're a lighthearted MMA fan, you'll find this match ridiculously entertaining.

DISC 3 - PRIDE 14

Wanderlei Silva vs Shungo Oyama - The same referee who poorly officiated Yasuda vs Satake, is back, and again, he screws this match up.

Chuck Liddel vs Guy Mezger - The ""Iceman"" Chuck Liddell invades Pride to take on its best light heavyweight Guy Mezger. A classic UFC vs Pride matchup.

Vitor Belfort vs Heath Herring - Sounds great on paper, doesn't it? Controversial conclusion that even stuns the commentators.

DISC 4: PRIDE 15

Quinton Rampage Jackson vs Kazushi Sakuraba - Jackson wreaks havoc and awe-inspires the audience.

Heath Herring vs Mark Kerr - Kerr sets to capture his former glory, but Herring is no pushover.

Antonio Nogueira vs Gary Goodridge - Enter the Minotauro...

DISC 5: PRIDE 16

Murilo ""Ninja"" Rua vs Daijiro Matsui - Enter Murilo Ninja. A battle of wits and stamina.

Antonio Nogueira vs Mark Coleman - The MMA world will never be the same again.

Don Frye vs Gilbert Yvel - ""The Predator"" Don Frye returns, but the desperate Yvel wants to steal his thunder... even if it means cheating.

Finally... this cheap DVD set will have you glued to the TV screen for days. Although the extra features are nonexistent, considering its price, this is a steal. If you want to see the rise of today's cream of the crop Pride fighters like Antonio ""Minotauro"" Rodrigo Nogueira and Wanderlei ""Axe Murderer"" Silva, all the while see some legends like Kazushi ""Happy Face"" Sakuraba and ""The Predator"" Don Frye, Legacy Volume 3 is your stairway to heaven.",1145491200,16,3343,4.6752136752136755
