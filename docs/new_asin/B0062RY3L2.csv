The dumping took place during the years I was in high school, and I was only in town for brief periods thereafter, so seeing this film after looking up some recent references on the internet to the community of Ramapough native people there was the first I knew of what happened to them or even that they were native Americans. This is a powerful story of injustice, and should be much more widely known.",1485216000,,606,4.324561403508772
8491466,3,B0062RY3L2,"This is a very important subject matter in the portrayal of how big business always wins via corruption and deep pockets with the aid and complliance of the very governmental agencies that are supposed to protect us; and how the relationship between politics and big business allows for genocide with absolutely no repercussions.  A more subtle message here is how the fetid political agency/corporate relationships have turned human misery and destruction into a cottage industry for lawyers.  Citizens United assured that corporations are people -- but the very legal structure of corporations prevents personal responsibility of corporate officers, so you CAN have your cake and eat it too -- if you have money and both implied and actual legal immunity.  The reason I didn't rate this higher is that they managed to take a really compelling case and widespread socio-economic issues and produced a documentary that repetitively misses the mark by dabbling in several critical --- historically and presently pertinent -- crises while not truly digging into any of them.",1482969600,,1072,5.294117647058823

8491469,5,B0062RY3L2,The truth comes out. Big business that cares more for profit than human beings. When will the madness stop. Politics and money are not good together.,1389571200,,149,4.769230769230769
8491470,5,B0062RY3L2,"Excellent documentary, surprised it never got more press.  It makes one wonder who runs the country, big business and money?  Profits at what cost is the issue with regards to human life.",1360368000,2,187,4.8125
