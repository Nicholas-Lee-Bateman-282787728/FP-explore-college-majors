2711582,5,B000LP528O,I received FitPack DVD as a gift for Christmas.  I haven't purchased many tapes as I'm not interested in most of the tapes that sit useless in my closet.  FitPack's short workouts are more like an uncomplicated workout format that allows me to get into shape in my living room and get my 13 year old daughter involved.  Unlike most gyms that don't allow children.  My daughter does the beginner and I the intermediate level and we both feel great about our accomplishments.  I really like the soothing music so I don't understand where the woman in the previous review was coming from with her comment.  This video has a nice unique feel with some special effects which I haven't yet seen in any workout video.  I'm sure you will love this DVD.  Definitely buy it.,1168473600,24,764,4.5661764705882355
2711583,1,B000LP528O,"I have at least 20 fitness videos, but wanted to get a couple on DVDs -- and I'm still looking, because this purchase was an expensive mistake.  No doubt if someone persisted in following these exercises, they'd get fit -- but I need leaders with enthusiasm, music with a beat, and participants who at least pretend to be having fun.  First exercise:  hold your hands out in front of you and waive your fingers and hands back an forth, for - no kidding - 120 seconds.  For excitement, stand on one leg, then switch to the other leg every 30 seconds or so.  Not my idea of motivation.  I'm going back to Denise Austin or ""The Firm.""",1168128000,18,631,4.35042735042735

There are  nine amazing workouts targeting just about every body part including a cardio workout to help shed those unwanted inches from your belly and tighten and tone those muscles!  The music is different and the special effects keep you interested time and time again.  Why go to a gym when you can workout at home with FIT PACK!!!",1165449600,7,516,4.389473684210526
2711595,5,B000LP528O,"These 9 short workouts work the whole body with no equipment needed.  Many of the workouts have different intensity levels from easy to hard.  One may work up from easier versions to more intense versions of exercises. I loved the abs & legs sections which are fairly intense.  Note that the short cardio section is high impact with a lot of jumps and you may want to modify or set up your own low impact cardio program like walking outside or getting an indoor walking DVD.  For many people, these workouts will add variety to your exercise program.

Here's the breakdown for the 9 workouts.

1. Shoulders (about 20 minutes) beginner, intermediate, and advanced
Exercises include arm & hand movements, planks, stretches, and so on.

2. Cardio (about 6 minutes) for all levels
This very short cardio is high impact, meaning a lot of jumping.

3. Buns (about 10 minutes) for all levels
All work is done on the ground (floor) as opposed to standing.

4. Abs (about 17 minutes) beginner and intermediate
Probably more of an intermediate abs program, you do what you can do and build yourself up over time.  This contains crunch variations, stretches, including work on the lower abs and the obliques (sides).

5. Abs (about 16 minutes) advanced
This contains an unique twisting or rotating exercise which I have only seen on this workout.

6. Chest (about 15 minutes) beginner, intermediate, and advanced
Exercises include arm & hand movements, pushup variations, and stretches.

7. Combo (about 30 minutes) beginner, intermediate, and advanced
Exercises involve arm & hand movements, stretches, pushups, back movements, leg movements, crunches, and holding positions.

8. Back (about 22 minutes) beginner, intermediate, and advanced
Exercises include back, arm & leg movements, along with holding positions and stretches.

9. Leg (about 29 minutes) beginner, intermediate, and advanced
This one may be intense and it has balance work.  It includes holding positions, leg movements, stretches, balance movements on one leg, squats, and calf raises.

Here is a little more detail regarding the levels.  Most workouts have a beginner, an intermediate, and an advanced version.  The advanced version may involve balancing on one leg so it may be more appropriately called a more intense version of the intermediate workout.  For example, lift one leg to make it more intense and lift it up higher for even more intensity.  So, balance work is covered in some of these workouts.

The upper body workouts are a bit different from other workouts and may involve  circling the arms and other arm and hand movements.

In addition, quite a few stretches are integrated throughout these workouts to aid you in getting more limber and flexible.",1320192000,12,2730,5.069506726457399
2711596,5,B000LP528O,"I purchased this workout about 3 weeks ago.  So far I am loving them.  I do a different workout each day. I started with Disc 1 and followed each workout, then went to Disc 2 and then back to Disc 1... I feel so good after.  You work your muscles with your body weight, stretch, yoga.  It is a great mix.  I can do without shoes, except for the cardio, and in my pj's!!  These exercises are not as easy as they may appear, try holding a pose for more than a minute or 2 and you will realize how many muscles you are using to hold your arm and leg...  Some workouts are 15 minutes some are about 25 minutes, but even the 15 minute days you get a great workout.",1316131200,2,659,3.946969696969697
2711597,5,B000LP528O,I ordered my product from fit pack dvd (on Amazon) rather than directly from Amazon. The DVD worked great. The workouts are short so you should have no problem fitting one or two workouts in a day. The exercises done during the workout are great for working out muscles you might not even think you had. Overall it's a great product and would purchase again if I had too.,1301184000,,371,4.391304347826087
2711598,4,B000LP528O,I liked everything about the video except the girl showing waaaaay too much animation in the abs segment. It is distracting!!,1279065600,2,125,5.0
2711599,5,B000LP528O,"After Joel Harper's Firming After 50, I added these Nine Short Workouts - not on the same day.  These workouts added bounce to my life.  It has energized me.",1267056000,4,157,4.379310344827586
2711600,4,B000LP528O,"First, I have not had any problems playing these DVDs. I have a ""regular"" (i.e. not Hi Def) Sony DVD player.

I first got interested in Fit Pack after receiving a DVD of Joel's workouts bundled with a copy of YOU the Owner's Manual. I like this style of workout--no equipment to drag out--just pop in the DVD and go. There are a couple of things I really like about this workout. First, it is pretty intense, and you should get some real muscle building/toning out of it, even without any weights. Second, there is a lot of work with balance, which you don't often see with strength training videos. This is really important for the 40-plus crowd as we can all lose proprioception as we age if we don't work on it. Third, there is plenty of stretching incorporated into the workouts. Also a big must for those over 40. Each workout has beginner, intermediate and advanced levels. But don't expect the beginner to be easy.

On the downside, Fit Pack is 9 ""short"" workouts, but I guess short is in the eye of the beholder. For example, the leg workout is about 30 minutes, but you don't get much (maybe not any) work on hamstrings. For that, you have to also do the 10-minute buns workout. That's 40 minutes just for legs. (However, you do get the balancing and stretching in there, so the time is well spent.) There is a lot of duplication between some of the workouts. The chest and shoulder workouts have so much in common that I do them together on the same day. I wouldn't recommend these two on consecutive days as you would be working a lot of the same muscles. At 7 minutes, the cardio workout really is short, but since 30 total minutes of cardio daily is the recommendation, a 7-minute workout doesn't fit in very well.
These issues are pretty minor. The one thing I really don't like is that there is a lot of sitting-on-your-feet style of kneeling. This puts a lot of torque on the knees and probably isn't good for a lot of people. I don't think this position is necessary for most of these moves, but there is no advice to modify given in the video.

Finally, don't expect high production values. Some of the cuing could have been better especially since you really can't look at the TV while doing many of these exercises. (Definitely do follow the recommendation to watch one time before participating.) When I hear ""Good Job!"" I expect I'm finished with a set. There is no counting out of reps. You try to do as many as you can in the time alloted, so it would be good to hear ""10 more seconds"" or something occasionally. It would be great to hear more about which muscles are being worked. For example, the back work out concentrates more on the lower back than the lats. It's easier to know if you're doing the exercise right when you're told where you should be feeling it. ""That back should be burning"" is not quite specific enough for me. You also get to see a dog run across the set and one of the models completely crack up during one of the work outs.

Having said all that, I really am enjoying these workouts. I'm sure I will be sticking with these for a good while since they will take some time to master and move all the way up to the advanced level. Regardless of your current level of fitness, these could be great for you as long as you have some weight training experience and feel comfortable making a few modifications as needed.",1265932800,9,3363,4.4106280193236715
2711601,1,B000LP528O,"I can't comment on the content of the DVD - I haven't watched them. Why not? These are not ""standard"" DVDs but are burned. They will not play on any player that will not play a ""home-made"" DVD.

The big print on the Amazon page for this product indicated DVD format. The fine print indicates: ""DVD-R Note: This product is manufactured on demand when ordered from Amazon.com""

2711602,2,B000LP528O,"I ordered this video series based on viewing the challenging, yet effective, workouts which Joel Harper produced for the YOU series created by Dr. Oz.  I figured I would get a DVD which permitted me to work out without a much equipment and a minimum of time.  From what I have seen, this series does indeed provide such a workout.  Unfortunately, I haven't seen much.  In the first Fit Pack I ordered, both discs were defective.  Disc Two skipped a lot, and Disc One would not play at all.  So Amazon kindly permitted me to exchange it and, kudos to Amazon, I received a replacement in two days.  The replacement is better since I can view most of the workouts, but one whole track on Disc Two will not play at all.  So, back it goes.

Based on the fact that another reviewer had the same problem, I believe this is no coincidence.  Something about the manufacturing process for this particular DVD set is flawed.  I would give this DVD a higher rating if I could, but it is impossible to separate the content from the delivery.  You simply cannot benefit from a DVD you cannot play.",1263513600,25,1083,4.441624365482234
2711603,4,B000LP528O,"I saw Joel Harper's Fit Over 50 program on PBS recently.  Decided to buy one of his workout dvd's.  Bought ""Fit Pack"" because it included 9 separate workouts rather than only 3 on ""Fit Over 50"".  I am 45.  I think the workouts are excellent.  There are three people working out on each segment.  One does beginning level moves, one does intermediate and one does expert.  I found that very helpful because as you get better/stronger, you can do the harder moves and not have to buy another DVD.  I also bout the Fit Over 50 dvd which has 3 workouts which I also liked, but that dvd is easier to do and at some point I will outgrow it.  Fit over 50 has one upper body workout, one lower body workout and one abs workout.

2711610,5,B000LP528O,"Fit Pack is a real amazing complete workout.
It taught me a lot of things.
I was sedentary, overweight and lacked flexibility.
I have a six pack indeed now, a lean core, strong shoulders, fast legs and I'm in the best shape and weight of my life. Everything with Fit Pack. You heard me. I haven't touched a dumbbell, a push-up bar, a medicine ball and neither I have runned outside.

Six Pack made me more knowledgeable about fitness and that allows me to explain something about this program.

Many won't notice it but Fit Pack includes a lot of different techniques to form the best cross training conditioning. They all so blend together magnificently that you don't realize you're doing so many things.

You have the calisthenics: push-ups, crunches, leg lifts, bun raises ...
You have dyamics: all the kicks
You have yoga: down dog, child, lord of the fish, cobra, eagle, table
You have isometrics: wall squat, knee-hand press, plank, side plank
You have interval training: cardio, squats ...
You have plyometrics: jumps
You have stretchings: harmstrings, shoulders, abs, back ...
You have balancing: all exercises standing on one leg

Studies have shown that push-ups provide a greater hypetrophic stimulus than bench pressing. And what about abs? Most gym goers just finish their workout with ab training which is just a series of crunches. Here you have one of the most complete abs training every including isometrics, heel drops, russian twists, superman, V-ups, legs lift, toes pointing.

There's everything you know to have the body you desire. It's a myth that body weight exercises can't build muscles. Resistance is resistance no matter the source. You can start with beginner positions and move to advanced and when even that isn't enough you can increase the reptition or crease challenging routine. For example advanced abs + legs + buns together. Then abs + chest + shoulders togheter.",1214092800,39,1904,4.993690851735016

1)  Joel incorporates three people-one is doing the beginning workout, another the intermediate and another the most difficult.  Most exercise videos/DVD's, that I have and I have quite an assortment-- don't do that.  And, so if the exercise is too hard--I can't do another version that still works the muscles but is more at my level.  Not to mention that I can do some of the beginner, some intermediate and some expert and do what works for me.

2) The exercises DO NOT require any extra equipment-no weights, bands, ball etc.  You use your own body weight to get a great workout.  So it is easily done at home or outside.

3) Workout time is perfect.  You can select from a whole group.  The combo is about 30 minutes and then other more specific workouts are less time and you can choose what you want or need to work on.

4) I even had questions and emailed Joel Harper and I got a response back!!  And, answered my specific question and did not send me some general email.  I was pleased!!

8162884,5,B000LP528O,Use the combo routine and in 20 minutes I workout the whole body. Great workout routines if you are pressed for time. You will see a change in your flexibility and endurance as time passes by. They are difficult at first but your body gets accustomed to the routine and adjusts accordingly. I feel more energized and see my body changing. Bought another cd to hand to my friends.,1366761600,,379,4.507246376811594
8162885,2,B000LP528O,"I was disappointed in this DVD. I'm 72 years old and these exercises are too difficult. I bought this because I have ""Joel Harper's Firming After 50"" which is more recent than  ""Fit Pack"", and I wanted to see his other work.  ""Firming After 50"" is infinitely a better production and serviceable for me.",1358467200,3,302,4.574074074074074

What I was looking for was Joel Harper's workout with resist tubes that was featured on RealAge.  The Fit-Pack was not it.  I am certain the Fit Pack delivers what it promises for people looking for this type of workout.  Joel's workouts are clearly represented and effective.",1351987200,,480,7.224137931034483
8162887,5,B000LP528O,"Excellent, excellent, excellent. I feel that these exercises do my body much more good than any kind of working out with weights or gym equipment would ever do. You have to remember that the goal of working out is to increase your strength, flexibility and endurance without *damaging* your body. The exercises here are pretty darn strenuous but without weights. There's one workout that's pretty much dedicated to pushups and the guy doing the ""medium difficulty"" - who I believe is an ex-Olympic athlete? - cannot keep up with Joel Harper at all.

I've had this video for a couple years, I've done all the exercises except the cardio, because I get my carido from walking and hiking. But my athlete friend who does yoga says the cardio one is intense.",1344297600,,753,4.748091603053435
