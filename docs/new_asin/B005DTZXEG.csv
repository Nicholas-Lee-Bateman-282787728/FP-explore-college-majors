8467507,4,B005DTZXEG,"Bronson is always a pleaser. The Brando Movie, ""Missouri Breaks"" wasn't known to me. I'm not a Brando fan, but this one was an entertaining surprise.",1364256000,2,149,4.769230769230769
8467508,1,B005DTZXEG,"All three films in this collection (Breakheart Pass, Man of the West, and The Missouri Breaks) have been squeezed onto the same side of ONE disc.  That's more than five hours of content, which results in absolutely horrible picture quality.  Add to that there are no bonus materials whatsoever, and that makes this just a terrible set.  Do not buy!  If you enjoy these films, you are better off seeking out the individual releases, even if they are more expensive.  Do not be fooled by the low price of this set.",1352505600,8,512,4.582417582417582
