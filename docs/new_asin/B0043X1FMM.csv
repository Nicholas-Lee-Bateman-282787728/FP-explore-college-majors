8415412,5,B0043X1FMM,"First Glance at the back of the DVD will find you saying:
""Where are the hits?""

By the time you reach the 3rd song or so you will find yourself saying:
""I can't believe these songs weren't hits!""

The reason they all sound like hits can be traced to the Figgs.  This set-list would be GOOD in the solo hands of Graham.
With the Figgs it is a truly superior show [...].

Pete Hayes on drums is as solid as Charlie Watts.  Pete Donnelly is as good as McCartney.
Mike Gent is a gem.  He's plugged into the same Chuck Berry Zeitgeist as KEEF.  The difference is that Mike knows where the mic is and he remembers all the lyrics.

Graham is an international treasure and a genuinely nice guy [...]

P.S. Thanks to moonlighting keyboardist Scott Janovitz [...]

THANKS!!!",1401062400,,765,4.4
8415413,5,B0043X1FMM,"I enjoyed this DVD much more than I expected to.
I don't usually find that DVD concerts represent any artist faithfully.
I'm a huge Graham Parker fan, and was not disappointed as I watched this fine concert.
Graham was in rare form and the Figgs were great.
GP's music, his songwriting ability, his incredible wit, all come through in this video.
And... the interview was a very nice icing on a wonderfully enjoyable cake.
If you are a fan, you need to own this one.",1295568000,,466,4.4941176470588236
8415414,5,B0043X1FMM,"The list of artists that can change your life, or at least the way you think about life, is really pretty short. Graham Parker is on that list. GP could not write a bad song if his life depended on it. The fact that he is still churning out great music is a gift to us all. I was thinking the other day about the sad fact that many artists do their best work later in their careers, but our youth-fixated society dismisses them out-of-hand. Well, unless they do a duets type record paired with young, hip, current pop stars. Of course, GP was never embraced by the mainstream, so no use lamenting too much. That whole story has been told. This DVD is so wonderful, from the song selection to the audio and video quality. The pacing of the set list is perfect, mixing new songs off Imaginary Television, with a wide span from other records. The Figgs are way cool, and seem to genuinely enjoy every moment of playing. You can tell that they respect the stature of GP, yet they come off like a cohesive band in their own right, including Graham. Being very competent, but not virtuoso musicians, they let the songs shine and never distract with any grandstanding or doodling. GP's voice still has all the emotion you need, tempered by a man who has seen it all and seems comfortable in his own skin. He appears comfortably resigned to his place today, and hopefully in rock n' roll history. In one segment he introduces the band members and tells about their day-jobs. These aren't folks with allusions of stardom, just your neighbor up the street that loves to play music  in between coaching high-school wrestling or making investment banking deals. There is something heart-warming about the whole dynamic. The audience is of course enthusiastic, being periodically coached on the making of the DVD aspect. Still the rapport is intimate and the band is very gracious to the small sized crowd. Graham can still touch the heart with ease, and bring home a ballad (hear 'Broken Skin') like nobody's business. There is a wonderful interview with GP included, that is very humorous at times and reveals nifty things about his early days, the the making of Imaginary Television, and his approach to song writing (which somehow seems simple, would that it were). Note: He never played in a pub rock band! I believe that someday the larger world will better come to know the music of Graham Parker, but maybe at this stage of the game everything has been written about GP that needs to be said, and it is time to just put in the DVD and enjoy the show. The package includes a CD with most of the songs on it, for when you can't take your TV with you. Thanks Graham!",1294876800,6,2658,4.549060542797495
8415415,5,B0043X1FMM,"If you're a long time Graham Parker fan you'll love this performance and the included interview and you'll definitely want to add this work to your collection. For those new to Graham I highly recommend this DVD/CD, you will not be disappointed. For those who have never heard of GP, well you probably aren't reading this review anyways. Let's just say he is the music industry's best kept secret.",1293753600,,397,4.768115942028985
8415416,5,B0043X1FMM,"I'm really glad I treated myself to this DVD.  I'm a long-time fan of Graham Parker and have seen him live about 4 times, but never with The Figgs.  I do have some live CD's with the Figgs backing Parker, so I knew I could expect a tight performance.  This performance shows why Graham continues to rely on them as a Rumour replacement.  The band's sound is great, though during Local Boys, when GP trades verses with his bandmates, it is clear that the mics for guitarist Mike Gent and bassist Pete Donnelly are too low.  I have no other complaints as the production value is good.  Watching it, one gets the impression GP is playing to a much larger audience.  The value is amazing considering you get an audio CD of the performance too.  Great interview with GP going over his origins and influences, and an explanation of his latest album Imaginary Television.  The new tunes shine in a very interesting set list, which could actually disappoint fans who expect more of GP's early years.  GP plays a nice array of songs from his entire career, but not songs you would necessarily expect -- one surprise being a grooving version of Black Lincoln Continental from Steady Nerves (a song choice that I've never seen in his set lists from previous tours).  This is a must for anyone who appreciates Graham Parker.  Worth every penny.",1292976000,3,1332,4.621276595744681
8415417,5,B0043X1FMM,"I picked up this dvd last weekend at a GP solo show.  The audio and video quality is great, and it contains a nice interview as well. (For anyone who doesn't know, Graham has a great personality and it's generally pleasant to hear what he has to say.)

The show has a nice feel to it, pretty much like you have a great seat at a live performance, without any kind of 'fluff' to get in the way.

I only have one other GP dvd (which is not formatted for US region, and i can only view on my computers) so this is really a special treat to own.  Any fan would LOVE to have this and, since i love sharing music i love with others, it is a good vid to interest new fans.

one last thing--i have only seen GP perform twice with a band, and all the rest were solo gigs, so owning a performance of him with a band is a lot of fun.
check it out and enjoy!",1292457600,2,846,3.867052023121387
8415418,5,B0043X1FMM,"I was at the show, and this sounds and looks a lot better than the live event.  If you are a fan this is a must have, any music lover would appreciate the quality of GP and the Figgs performance, and would be a good intro to his style and back catalogue.  I'm just waiting for my royalty check as we appear about a half dozen times in between tunes as the camera scans the audience.  Filmed one night in Fairfield Connecticut in a venue which probably seats about 150.  Great memories, and this is a great live disk with the bonus interview.",1292371200,5,541,4.223300970873787
8415419,5,B0043X1FMM,"If you're a big fan of Graham Parker, you must own this.  The video quality is top notch, as is the 5.1 audio.  This is really a true concert video.  It's the real thing, from the 2010 tour promoting the Imaginary Television album.  So there's a lot of material from the new record.  Most artists would have leaned more on the old chestnuts, knowing that the show was being videotaped.  But GP is too real for that.  Make no mistake, there are a bunch of old faves, particularly strong renditions of Life Gets Better, Local Girls, Mercury Poisoning, White Honey, and Soul Shoes.  In addition, it's a treat to hear some refreshing deep tracks like England's Greatest Clown, Blue Highways, My Love's Strong, and Turn it into Hate.  His band is great, and the rapport on stage is very revealing; they know they're in the presence of greatness and thusly basking in the glory of it all.  I basked as well...I'm endorsing the basking.  Bask away!",1292371200,11,941,4.608433734939759
