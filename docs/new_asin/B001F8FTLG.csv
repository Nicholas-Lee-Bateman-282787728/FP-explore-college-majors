8301296,2,B001F8FTLG,"I felt a little short changed.  There are only 4 projects covered in this DVD, the product description tell you about the 4 but I thought there would be more. Also, having a segment on ""the world famous Mentos Fountain"" is a let down because this information can be found all over Youtube.

It was an interesting DVD but not worth the money.",1444694400,,341,4.396825396825397
8301297,3,B001F8FTLG,"This is a good video if you are a visual person that likes to see someone actually fit stuff together.  The most irritating part though is the long, unable to fast-forward, and constant safety disclaimers and reminders.  It's really too much and it's too bad that a legal department got hold of this.

Stick to the books, many of the same projects are in there.

Also, if you want to watch this with little kids, be warned.  The Barrage Garage girls are there as eye-candy, and kind of cheesy.",1252972800,,493,4.49438202247191
