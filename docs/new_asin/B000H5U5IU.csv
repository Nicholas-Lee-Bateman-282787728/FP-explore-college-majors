8136403,4,B000H5U5IU,"When I popped Tiki into my dvd player, my expectations were not very high but I was hoping to be entertained. Truthfully, this is a low budget picture with average actors. If this fact is enough to scare you away, avoid this movie. If you are okay with this, then give it a shot.

The plot of this movie centers around a Carrie-like theme. Nerdy girl is humiliated by snobs and gets revenge by use of a tiki doll manifestation of her anger. Most of the murder scenes are brutal, creative, and sometimes comical. I could not help but laugh at the absurdity of the murder methods and the gibbering of the tiki throughout the movie.

Don't expect a lot of extras or a widescreen presentation. There is a making of featurette and trailer.

This is not a knock your socks off surprise, but I was definitely more entertained than I expected to be. If decently executed stupidity is what you are looking for, then you will probably find this movie worth a viewing. I am being generous with the four star rating because I typically dig independent films with limited budget and talent because I am pretty tired of the schlock out of hollywood. I like giving my money to people who will more likely appreciate it.

I had fun watching it, and I hope you do too. I am not comparing the movie to cinematic masterpieces. This to me is a four star independent horror picture, which is totally different from a four star big hollywood production. I rate with consideration of budget, personal expectations, and overall entertainment value.

If you watch this and hate it, remember, this is my personal opinion of this movie and I apologize if my review causes you to watch it and feel as if you have wasted 80 minutes of your life. Remember, it is a great privilege to live in a country where we have the ability to watch what we want, when we want. That in and of itself is a beautiful thing. Just knowing that I have that opportunity is enough to make watching any movie time well wasted.

Thanks for reading the review. Now go tell somebody that you love them.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tiki/dp/B000H5U5IU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tiki</a>",1182470400,2,2172,4.763297872340425
