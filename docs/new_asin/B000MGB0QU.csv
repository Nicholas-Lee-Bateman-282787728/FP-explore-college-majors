8198820,5,B000MGB0QU,"I could not find this series anywhere else. I found it here and understood about the PAL format. When I popped it into my computer to play I did not get any prompts to change my region settings. I do have a number of video converting and playing software programs installed on my computer, and that is probably the reason. I loved this show as a kid, and I am so glad I have finally found copies of the program to watch.",1395878400,,420,4.134146341463414
8198821,1,B000MGB0QU,"I was  very disappointed, not able to use due to region.  Nothing was noted on this when purchasing. I even tried on my laptop but it told me I had to change my region settings, and the worst part is your only allowed to do this a max of  3 times.  I love the movie but can only watch once.  This also happened again on another movie I purchased through amazon, it was called Live Virgin, this one required a different region than this one.",1367625600,,440,4.129411764705883
