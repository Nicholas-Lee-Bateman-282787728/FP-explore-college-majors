8684716,5,B00OSZVC9Q,"First up, let me say I'm a big fan of the film. There are many who don't care for it, complaining it's too slow, too long, etc., etc. To each their own, while I admit it's not perfect, it's close. It was probably the last big-budget epic film with real people and not computer trickery, on that point alone it's amazing. It's a shame that during Sergio Leone's lifetime he wasn't as revered as today, but to his eternal credit, he knew what he wanted and moved heaven and earth to realize his vision. Every film of his beginning with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-The-Bad-The-Ugly/dp/B004TJ1H2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good, The Bad & The Ugly</a>"" was butchered by studios, recut and remolded without his input, but time has been kind. With all these films, including ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Upon-a-Time-in-the-West/dp/B004T0XYM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Upon a Time in the West</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Duck-You-Sucker-aka-A-Fistful-of-Dynamite/dp/B00MA151W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Duck You Sucker aka A Fistful of Dynamite</a>,"" now available in versions that honor his vision, we and future generations can now enjoy the work of a master craftsman......

When I first became aware that the 2014 Extended Director's Cut was on the pre-release timetable I sold my original 2011 Blu-ray. If you're thinking about buying this and doing the same, I advise you to search out the single-disc Extended Director's Cut, and keep your older Blu-ray. The new two-disc Collector's Edition has the same ""Director's Cut"" as re-released in 2011. Upon initial viewing I thought it had been re-remastered as well, but a more intense comparison proved me wrong. The new expanded edition looks fantastic, the detail and clarity is palpable and exhibits more depth and some nice grain. The biggest difference between the two is the color reproduction, the Extended Version's palate is totally different than the 2011's. It has a more brownish-almost-sepia ""aged"" look as opposed to the original Blu-ray release which had a more ""standard"" look, which some viewers might prefer. The film as a whole is darker as well, you only have to compare the very first scene, where Eve comes into Noodle's room, to notice the differences between the two. I might add that the effect is subtle, not overdone as in the original version of HEAVEN'S GATE. I also didn't realize that most of the added footage doesn't match the quality of the rest of the film and has a ""washed out"" appearance. Quite a few reviewers don't think the added footage adds much to the original release either. In some cases I agree, but some of it fills in some plot holes and better explains character motivations, it's a shame it's not in perfect shape. The two-disc set comes in a nice sturdy slipcase containing a small hardcover book and a standard two-disc blu-ray case......

So, what is the extra footage you may ask? Here's a rundown of what's added with my opinion of it's value. Obviously there are going to be MAJOR SPOILERS (and dissenting readers), you've been warned! There are six additional scenes:

1. After ""Noodles"" (Robert De Niro) goes to the mausoleum where he finds the bus station (Grand Central?) locker key, there is a scene with Louise Fletcher as the cemetery manager, while they talk, Noodles notices a black Cadillac that seems to be following him until he walks toward it, causing it to pull away. After my first viewing I felt it was the most superfluous of the six, maybe because it's also in the worst shape and jarring at first. After a second viewing I found that it, and the one that follows later on, helps explain Noodles initial paranoia (1:34:49-1:38:21)....

2. Noodles is outside Secretary Bailey's (James Woods) gate and sees the now famous garbage truck (""35""). The black Caddy is shown leaving Bailey's compound, and as Noodles is watching it go down the street, it explodes. The scene helps support two later, when Noodles is watching a TV report of the incident at Fat Moe's (Larry Rapp) and of course, the finale (2:08:39-2:10:35)....

3. Making small-talk with the chauffeur (producer Arnon Milchon!) while waiting for Deborah (Elizabeth McGovern) to go on their elaborate date, Noodles mentions the persecution of the Jews in Germany and that he's Jewish. The driver says he knows, and that he is Jewish as well, studying for a degree. He chides him for being a Jewish (and imitation Italian) gangster, making Noodles defensive, bragging about how much money he makes. Interesting, but it really doesn't add much except reinforcing why Noodles doesn't retaliate when the chauffeur shows his disgust and refuses Noodle's money after the rape (2:34:00-2:35:10)....

4. After Deborah's rape there's a scene showing how he met his girlfriend Eve (the one who gets gunned down in the beginning). This scene later cuts to an extension of the scene showing Deborah preparing to take the train to California. The scene helps explain why he stays with her after their initial one-night stand (she's nice) (2:48:13-2:54:00)....

5. Deborah is shown performing the lead in Shakespeare's ""Antony and Cleopatra"" with Noodles in the audience. It's the final scene in the play where she commits suicide by asp. Her soliloquy about being the downfall of Caesar and Antony is obviously meant to be a comment on the Max/Noodles paradigm. The scene leads into where they talk in her dressing room  (3:28:03-3:30:20)....

6. This scene adds the most to the emotional balance of the film, and quite frankly I can't understand why it was cut. At Bailey/Max's party, after the shot where Max is looking out the window at his son, it cuts to a scene with Jimmy O'Donnell (Treat Williams) that explains more fully why Bailey/Max is in trouble. At one point Treat's character even recommends he commit suicide. After Treat leaves, Noodles comes in as in the previous versions. This scene is the lengthiest addition and sort of puts to rest the view that the whole movie is Noodle's ""opium dream."" Max's self-loathing and sense of defeat throughout both scenes lends credence to his choice of ""death by garbage truck"" (3:41:42-3:46:45)....

All in all, if you're a fan of the film, this version's a must. At first I wasn't sure if I liked the color palate, but upon a second viewing I kind of prefer it, the brownish hues lends a more autumnal quality to the film as a whole. The older ""Director's Cut wasn't too shabby either, and as I've noted I'm sure many other viewers will prefer it's brighter picture and more vibrant colors. Leone fans will want to have both. An essential purchase......",1459987200,37,6740,5.180899908172635

Although it is very violent and I usually do not care for movies of this type, I was O.K with spending the cost since it was an entire evening of quality movie.
