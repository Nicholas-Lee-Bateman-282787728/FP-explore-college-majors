2290630,5,B0009HKUEK,The warm up exercise included in this DVD alone is worth the money. If you follow Tony's advice to practicing you will build the strength in your fingers and coordination to play in a band sooner than later. The DVD includes a password so you can download and print the warm up exercise sheet at the icons of rock site. I keep mine in my case.,1158105600,24,343,4.212121212121212
2290631,2,B0009HKUEK,Definitely for the absolute beginner who has never seen a bass upclose. Very little learning material. Could do with more indepth explanation. Would not recommend this one.,1156291200,13,172,5.407407407407407
2290632,5,B0009HKUEK,Great instructional video for new aspiring bass players. Shows the fundamentals in easy to understand language. Just great.,1142812800,25,123,5.888888888888889
2290643,5,B0009HKUEK,Thank you!,1404691200,,10,4.5
2290644,5,B0009HKUEK,This is an excellent product.  Very helpful in learning to play the bass guitar.  This is one product that is very helpful,1396483200,,122,4.5
2290645,4,B0009HKUEK,just a little difficult follow dvd while using book. Can be used with practice. not sure any other program could be easier.,1372896000,,123,4.636363636363637
2290646,4,B0009HKUEK,"Very good instruction, better than the freebie that came with the bass itself. My only reservations are that I believe it's difficult to learn any instrument properly without real personal instruction, though that's not the fault of this DVD itself of course. But I'd say it's a good start so you can start plunking away immediately and get the feel for the instrument before starting to pay significant money for a professional instructor. BTW if you are thinking of buying this, you should also be shopping for a good tuner, preferably one of the combo tuner/metronomes.",1369267200,,572,4.96875
2290647,3,B0009HKUEK,"It's definitely what it stated, but it should have emphasized the word beginner. If you feel that you need something very very basic that will explains how to hold the bass, how to pluck a bass string and some descent bass excersises to do, and that you or the one you're sending it to lives out where they don't have the internet, then it does it's job well. If you have the internet, go to youtube and just look these up. Very very basic. If you've played guitar at all and are making a transition to bass, I wouldn't recommend.",1332115200,2,530,4.31
2290648,2,B0009HKUEK,"I know not everyone is a great public speaker, and the guy's credentials are amazing. Plus he knows his stuff and teaches some decent exercises. Hving said that, it's touch to watch and listen sometimes because every other word was Uh um, etc. It's like they did it all on one take, and it came off unprofessional. I really should have just listened to friends who advised me as a  beginning bassist just to use free you tube videos. I see why now.",1331856000,11,448,4.397590361445783
2290649,5,B0009HKUEK,"My husband is a self-taught musician and is very talented. This is the perfect video for him to branch out into bass because it jumps right into showing the user how to pick up the guitar and play. If you have no background in music, you might want to opt with something with a little more introductory background.",1326067200,3,314,4.431034482758621
2290650,2,B0009HKUEK,"For the price, this video gives you a brief overview of raw beginner level material. I can't get over how vague Tony is in his suggestions of technique. But by judging from his very inefficient left hand fingering (notice how far from the fingerboard his left-hand fingers are while fretting) I am surprised that he has been so successful. I enjoyed the humor but can't get past the many ""I've been playing for 30 years"" comments.

Another bass video that gives you a trickle of the still-new electric bass guitar method from someone who is obviously self-taught (not always a bad thing) but has acquired poor left hand habits. Since he's been playing for ""30 years"" he is obviously now set in his ways. Unfortunately, those ways might be transferred to others just starting to play the bass guitar.",1321920000,6,799,4.748201438848921
2290651,4,B0009HKUEK,"Tony seems a little uncomfortable on video, but he starts to loosen up a bit.  The whole thing could have been better scripted, but Tony does a good job of taking you through the basics to start.  Early on it seems he could have made some of his points faster and moved on to other topics.  The vid would also have worked better with a lot of shorter chapters that you could easily jump to.

I was happy to see a 5-string bass on the cover, and also happy to see Tony playing his 5-string to start.  But just when he gets down to real instruction, he puts down the 5-string and picks up a 4-string.  Nothing wrong with a 4-string -- and the concepts are certainly transferable -- but if you're starting out on a 5-string, you may wish for an instructor who can teach you from the very beginning how to incorporate that low B into your playing.

Still, there's some solid instruction here, and it will at least tide a new player over until he or she decides to get some instruction in person.  If you follow what Tony says, you won't be learning the wrong things.  And the exercises he provides are great for developing speed and dexterity.",1304553600,8,1139,4.334905660377358
2290652,5,B0009HKUEK,This Video lets you know just what it takes to be a great Bass player and shows how to get to that level. Great DVD!!!!!!!,1202601600,3,122,3.92
