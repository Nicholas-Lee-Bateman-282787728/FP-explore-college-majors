8346521,2,B001VJ4A96,"I saw the movie as a kid, I didn't like it then nor now.  The quality was poor then, it hasn't changed.  As I said this was to complete my collection only.  It does not get played at all. For the collector, I would say get this and look for the cheapest sale price, damn the free shipping, find it for a penny if you can.",1400976000,,321,3.8333333333333335
8346522,5,B001VJ4A96,"If Bruce Lee ever had an Afro-American male cousin ""Jim Kelly"" would be ""it,"" and hard to ""forget!"" Back in the day (1960's - 1978) Enjoying Jim Kelly so much, to break the color beerier I would wish I was wealthy enough to have all three; Bruce Lee, Jim Kelly and Chuck Norris in a movie together teaming up against the bad guys.  And I would title the movie ""The Three Kung Fu-teers"" (A futuristic Martial Arts version of ""The Three Musketeers"").  If the Martial Arts' Industry would have ever gave credit to ""Black American History"" Jim Kelly would  be somewhere in the top three next to Joe Louis and Hammomad-Ali.  To have ever seen Jim Kelly in his early Martial  Arts footages would make any fight-fan . . . ""Bruce Lee Proud!""  Many blessings to the surviving Lee friends and family as well as blessings to the Kelly friends and family.  As they say in legendary world history. . . ""They'll Never Be Another!""  I heard:""After God Made Them He Broke The Mold!""
  Sincerely
