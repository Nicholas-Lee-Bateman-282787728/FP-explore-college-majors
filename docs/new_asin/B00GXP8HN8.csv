6123786,5,B00GXP8HN8,"Great for beginners. Very detailed and I like the way she presented herself. I would definitely recommend this video, even for intermediates",1401926400,2,140,5.409090909090909
6123787,5,B00GXP8HN8,"I will preface this review that when I watched this video I was not a complete beginner to photography.  I already understood the basics of using shutter, aperture, and ISO to achieve a correct exposure.  However, the way the material is presented in this video is way better than anything I ever encountered when I first started learning about photography on my own.  This video would have made it so much easier to learn what I was doing and how best to adjust settings to achieve my desired outcome.

This proves to me that you really do get what you pay for.  Many of the resources I used when learning were free guides and videos found on the internet.  While the same basic information is provided in this video as in those other resources, the way it is presented and explained is different.  It's very obvious that a lot of time and consideration were put into how the video was organized and presented, and that time and effort deserves and is worth the price.  You can either spend hours and hours using a bunch of slapped together resources that are free, or just get one that will teach it the right way the first time.

In addition, you are encouraged to take some time actually doing what has been explained before moving on to the next step.  Take that time to actually do it!  Yes, you can learn what different settings do by watching a video or reading an article/book, but you won't truly understand it until you practice doing it!",1401321600,2,1449,4.513409961685824
6123788,1,B00GXP8HN8,Unless you know little or nothing about your dSLR don't waste your money. I'm a beginner but learned very little. Buy a good how-to book.,1399852800,,137,4.52
6123789,5,B00GXP8HN8,"I simply loved this video guide! It's so simple, and you still can learn so much with it. And the exercises reeeeally help!",1396915200,,123,4.391304347826087
6123790,5,B00GXP8HN8,"When I first got my Canon a few years ago, I was definitely a beginner! I still am. I've left it on Auto for the longest time until I received this video guide to help me enhance my photography skills.

I love that the DVD kept my attention. It wasn't boring at all. The entire video doesn't take much of your time which is a plus for me since I have a toddler that keeps me busy! Each chapter will go over the different modes on your camera and you'll get to put your skills to the test with the assignments included in the guide. I love this feature because you can practice the variety of techniques with each lesson as you go along.

This interactive video guide is a must for beginners!",1396396800,,691,4.18796992481203
6123791,5,B00GXP8HN8,"This course is clear, concise, & is very easy to understand. I recommend this to anyone trying to figure the jargon out. Simply awesome!",1394668800,,136,4.708333333333333
6123792,5,B00GXP8HN8,"I absoutely LOVE, LOVE my camera and totaly enjoy photography, but as much as I want to learn,  I don't have time to join an intensive weekend workshop that costs $200-$400. So based on the ratings this video guide was receiving, I decided to order and see what the hype was about. I am overly joyed!! The guided tutorial is easy to listen to, easy to understand, and it allows you to stop and practice what you've just learned. I tell you, this video connected my mind's puzzled pieces about photography!! FINALLY I know why my pictures were coming out blurry, dark, and just funky looking. I still need a lot of practice, so I'll be watching and reviewing this video for quite a long while. It is totally worth the money and totally worth your time.
PS) Photography Overnight has some, not all, of these tutorials on YouTube if your want to sample some of their videos.",1393286400,2,871,4.512658227848101
6123793,5,B00GXP8HN8,"I found this was loaded with good info. In fact, I will need to watch it several times to absorb it all.  I like that they give you assignments to do so you can really grasp what they are talking about as you go.",1392681600,2,212,3.8181818181818183
6123794,5,B00GXP8HN8,"Good beginners video to get you aquatinted with your new dslr and how to use it , I found this video helpful, and it explains how to get out of shooting in auto and how to shoot in manual mode and how to achieve  a correctly exposed photo in manual mode .After each  lesson is explained the video tells you to pause and practice what you have learned in small sections , easy to understand video and I find very helpful for someone who wants to venture off of the Auto modes, Remember the more you practice and take photo's the better you will get at your photography.",1391817600,4,568,4.25
6123795,5,B00GXP8HN8,"I wish I had watched Beginners Guide to SLR Photography when I first got my camera!

I watched the video via download on my computer, but it also comes as a DVD. I like that its not brand specific to one type of camera and that it won't matter what kind of DSLR you own to benefit from the information. Its about 40 minutes long and was easy to watch. Bethany, the photographer on the video, speaks slowly and clearly giving you lots of time to absorb the information and take notes. When I watched the video, I had a pen and paper with me to jot down some notes of items I wanted to remember. She also has assignments after each section where you can pause the video and go try out what you just learned with your camera.

Heres a few things that youll learn in the video:

1. Three Settings of Getting Light in Your Camera: Learn about shutter speed, aperture, and ISO and how to adjust them to get the shot you want.

2. Camera Modes: Learn when to use the modes on your camera (ie. Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority).

3. White Balance: Learn the types of white balance and when to use them as well as learning how to create a custom white balance.

4. Raw vs. Jpg: Learn what each one is and the positives and negatives of both.

5. Types of Lens: Learn the different kinds of lens and how to understand at first glance what type of lens is it just by looking at the name.

6. Types of Flash: Learn how to use a mounted external flash to control and diffuse light.

7. Taking Photos Outdoors & Indoors: Tips and tricks to get the best photos both outside and inside.

8. Common Photography Equipment: Learn about memory cards, batteries, lens filters and more.

Some of the information from the video I knew, but there was quite a bit that I did not know. For the stuff I knew, it was a good refresher especially motivating me to step out of my comfort zone and shoot solely in manual mode.

If you are a beginner or need a refresher course on using your camera, this is the perfect DVD to watch. It won't take up too much of your day and is packed full of information that you can use right away and put into practice in your photography.",1391212800,11,2146,4.245700245700245
6123796,5,B00GXP8HN8,"I have been searching for a good video that would help me to learn the different settings on my camera. I learned how to shoot in manual mode, and get picture that would be exceptional. I had been shooting in Auto, and it wasn't doing that great. They make it really easy to understand, and I took some pictures and you can truly see a difference. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn how to adjust shutter speed, ISO, aperture, and such in manual mode to get the most out of the picture!!",1390521600,6,504,4.260416666666667
6123797,5,B00GXP8HN8,"This DVD was very helpful in getting me used to the camera. If you are looking for more advanced lessons this DVD is not for you, but if you are looking for a great interactive guide to photography for beginners this is a great DVD! I paused after each lesson to try out the assignment and because I am a visual learner, it helped me to learn quickly.",1390003200,4,351,4.176470588235294
6123798,5,B00GXP8HN8,"I've had my camera for while now, but have been so overwhelmed with trying to figure everything out. This DVD lays everything out in clear, simple, easy to understand terms. Watching this DVD made everything I had heard, but not really understood about photography fall perfectly into place. Not only does she cover the basics to help you get started taking good pics, she also gives great tips for creating bokeh, diffusing light, and other ways to get a nice professional looking photo. I definitely recommend this DVD to anyone just starting out with photography. It would make a great gift too!",1389225600,4,598,4.872549019607843
6123799,5,B00GXP8HN8,"I had the opportunity to try out this awesome new video program, Beginners Guide to SLR Photography, to review on my blog. It teaches you all the basics of your dSLR camera in just one hour with plenty of examples, explanations, and even assignments which made it really easy to understand. I really enjoyed following along with the video and learning why I needed to move off of the automatic modes, even the semi-automatic modes like Aperture priority or Shutter Priority to make the most of my pictures. Taking the step forward to move my camera over to manual and not be afraid to play around the settings has made a huge difference in my photography! All the different aspects of my camera including aperture/f-stop, ISO, shutter speed, white balance, and other settings are very clearly explained with examples. This made it so easy to follow right along with the video, pausing or going back and replaying parts of the training video that I needed to hear again or take time to look up in my camera's manual. Really great course!",1389052800,2,1036,4.7292817679558015
6123800,5,B00GXP8HN8,This dvd is very informative. I would say it is for anyone new to dslr use.  She teaches well in a manner that is easy to listen to.  After each segment she encourages you to stop and apply what you've learned.  I would love for her to offer more of her dvds on Amazon.,1388016000,,269,3.9444444444444446
6123801,5,B00GXP8HN8,"I really liked how this is a more ""hands on"" approach to learning how to use your camera.  It was nice that the video stops to give you assignments to take different types of pictures with your camera and it really helped me to put everything I was learning into practice.  I also liked the example photos they used to show the different effects it will have on your picture.  I feel so much more comfortable using the different settings on my camera now.  Thanks for a great product!",1387324800,,484,4.404494382022472
6123802,5,B00GXP8HN8,"Hi Bethany,
I have posted my review on amazon and I want to thank you again for this
opportunity.  I have owned my camera for some time now, but could never
understand how everything worked.  I have had many explanations, but until I
could see the examples that you gave with each step, I couldn't put it all
together.  Also, I have wanted and tried to get some of your other dvd's,
but have been nervous about putting out the money for them. (being a single
mom, money is tight and I have been burned with past purchases) So, now that
I know what they are like, I am going to try to purchase other dvd's from
you. I can't tell you how excited I am about my camera!
Thank you so much,
Dawn",1387238400,,689,4.126865671641791

8628488,5,B00GXP8HN8,"As a budding photographer interested in portrait and wedding photography, I found this to be the most useful DVD to date.
