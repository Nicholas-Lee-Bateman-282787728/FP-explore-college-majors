2452549,4,B000C3L2BQ,"This DVD is entertaining and a good workout.  The time really flew--when I work out, I'm usually watching the clock and bored.  Today I was engaged the entire time and surprised when the cool-down started--it seemed as if we'd only just begun dancing!

Note: The case lists that this is a combination of hip-hop, martial arts, and Indian dancing.  I really only saw the bangra in the DVD itself.",1151971200,7,395,4.681159420289855
2452550,1,B000C3L2BQ,The DVD cover is misleading - the moves on this DVD are embarrassing. You could never dance in a club with these moves - they are so unattractive. I cant imagine why anyone would want to dance like these twins!,1147132800,12,210,4.275
2452551,5,B000C3L2BQ,"This workout video is GREAT if you're looking for variety and don't like repetitive movements.  But be warned!  It is VERY energetic and will definately leave you feeling it in your calves in the end of all 3 routines.  If you're someone who likes to get a lot done in little time, then definately get this video!!",1145923200,6,314,4.473684210526316
2452552,2,B000C3L2BQ,I bought this DVD because I like Masala Bhagra fitness video.  It was difficult to keep up with the twins and not enough room in my living room to do it.  Before I knew it the dvd was done.  It did get my heart rate up but for only 20 mins I try to keep it up for at least 30-45.  Overall it's just another workout dvd in my collection that I probably won't go back to.,1143158400,9,369,3.7532467532467533
2452553,4,B000C3L2BQ,"Ok, the sisters are a little difficult to keep up with in terms of their counting but the music is really great and the alternative to conventional aerobics is welcome!  The workout is just long enough to make you feel good, and short enough to leave you feeling that way.  I ended the workout with a smile on my face and saying goodbye to the twins on the screen.",1143072000,2,364,4.260869565217392
2452554,3,B000C3L2BQ,"I have given this workout 3 stars because I am sure there are some people who would like it, but if I based it on how much I liked it, it would probably get 1 star.  I bought it because I loved the twins' previous bellydance workout videos.  However, this is nothing like their other videos, so I hope no-one else makes the same mistake.  There is no bellydance in this video.  It is a dance form based on hip-hop and an intense form of Indian dance.  But for someone who is not familiar with the Indian dance form, it felt like it was entirely hip-hop, which I did not like.  It is undoubtedly a fantastic cardio workout and had me sweating, but I just hated the dance moves, the music, and pretty much everything about it.  I couldn't wait until it was over and I never watched it again.  So, basically, this is not for fans of bellydance, but I am sure that fans of hip-hop would like it.",1140998400,20,891,4.2
2452555,5,B000C3L2BQ,"I got this DVD for Christmas and did my first workout that morning. I have all the other belly twins workout dvds, and I have always enjoyed the production quality and that they show the moves pretty well, and that I tend to have fun doing their bellydance routines. This is the same for me, though there are a few differences. Here, they work out in front of a group of backup dancers, so it's more like a lot of other videos. They have a warm up, three mini routines and a yoga stretch. There aren't a lot of extras, just the play with music only option and a mini history of ""Indi-Hop"" and a little dance montage, but the montage is a bit too earnest in trying to be cutting edge with not much dancing to be seen, but the workout is good. I admit I hadn't worked out much an awhile, and I felt this, got sweaty and I really felt it in my arms too. It's sort of martial arts inspired, with a bit of Bollywood flair (I'm no expert in Bollywood and Indian dance, but I could see the roots of some movements I've seen in a couple Bollywood productions). Lots of kicking, arms up in the air, a few dance steps. The yoga feels great afterwards, and I found it a lot of fun. And it's 30 minutes so there's time to do the workout, and if you want more practice/exercise, there's always rewind.",1135641600,27,1288,4.176706827309237
8095481,1,B000C3L2BQ,"This is the first review I've done in hundreds of Amazon purchases and for a reason, too many. First, it said 42 min. and it went 35, second, half of it was yoga and if I want a yoga video then I will buy one, third, having all those people in the background is silly, childish, and not what I expected from their other videos I've done, and fourth, most importantly, it is marketed as ""low impact, high energy"" and it should be the other way around. If you have ANY issues with your knees, DO NOT attempt this and if you have ANY issues with your feet such as a history or a proneness to weak, sprained, fractured, or broken feet once again DO NOT attempt this video and DO NOT think because you don't weigh a lot you can constantly jump and beat your feet into the floor and you will be okay if you have any of the above conditions because you won't.",1521244800,,852,4.13855421686747
8095482,3,B000C3L2BQ,i don't expect them to do any counting and in this video they count through the steps. not my style and i thought not theirs either.,1482796800,,132,4.115384615384615
8095483,5,B000C3L2BQ,"I'm a middle age women with health problems and can't do all that high paced jumping around, but with the Belly Twins Videos I'm able to stay in shape and have great fun while I do it. I have purchased all the Belly Twins videos I can find and have even gotten my friends and family into the action. So enjoy and have fun while you get healthy.",1383177600,,344,4.073529411764706

8095485,4,B000C3L2BQ,"After seeing several DVD's on the market for Bhangra, I was interested in seeing what Neena and Veena had put together.  I like this video.  Video production which includes quality of sound and lighting were all well done.  They came up with a great workout using a nice blend of Indian moves as well as some from other styles to get a well rounded product.  And last, they included a nice montage video that lets you see a bit behind the makings of this DVD as well as some great dancing.  Good Job Ladies!",1189728000,,507,4.351063829787234
8095486,2,B000C3L2BQ,"I love bhangra music and dancing- this dvd was very much a teaser... you only learn enough to feel lke you saw a trailer for a workout dvd.  There are very brief warm-up and cool-down that (do but) barely use yoga moves.  And then three short 3-4 move ""routines"" that definately get you jumping around and work out your back legs well from the jumping but as far as taking them into performance or the dance floor- you probably wouldn't.  The workout felt good- my muscles felt really warm and my legs surely received some toning but as I am more interested in dance as an artform as opposed to a mere excercise... this dvd disappointed me.  I would recommend instead, The Bollywood Workout.  That one again really works the legs and challenges you to let loose and laugh with your whole body- a great workout but feels much more like you just had a dance party.  It is more fun and more useful for broadening your dance move vocabulary.",1176336000,6,937,4.482352941176471
8095487,5,B000C3L2BQ,"This is not your regular bellydancing dvd, it is more like a bollywood bellydance which is a lot different. I bought it because I have indian friends who got me into bollywood movies and I thought that learning that kinda dance would be cool and different. And it is lots of fun. I haven't done it for a while because I bought their belly dancing dvd which is more fun.

So if you are interested in indian bellydancing then this the dvd for you.",1165708800,,445,4.2976190476190474
8095488,4,B000C3L2BQ,"I couldn't believe how fast the time flew by. When I hit cool down mode I was stunned. It was by far the fastest and most fun workout I've ever done. I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't at all bellydancing, which I was really interested in, but it was still a great workout. I was sweating in no time, and my arms and stomach ached soon after. I recommend this workout for people who hate working out, and LOVE..or need cardio. This is a great workout for beginners and it takes no time to do, so there's no excuse not to work out.",1162339200,3,531,4.066666666666666
8095489,5,B000C3L2BQ,"I thought the dvd was fun, and energetic, it definitely got me sweating, I liked the Bellytwins so I thought I'd give it a try, like mose people said, this is NOT a bellydance dvd...I have a lot of bellydance dvds including Neena and Veenas, and I am a bellydancer, but I think someone could enjoy this if they are into any kind of Indian dance. They mix yoga in there...No these moves are not for the dance floor, they are more for just exercising...there is a bonus dance on the video for the more dance that you could do if you were wanting to try out the dance. Though I definitely prefer bellydance dvds...I do like this one, it's different from the other exercise dvds I've seen",1160179200,2,684,4.3515625
8095490,3,B000C3L2BQ,"I too love their old bellydance dvds which is why I gave this one a shot though I tried a Bhangra dance dvd before & hated ths stiff, jerky movement style of that dance w/a british woman leading who had no rhythm. On bellytwins com you can see a short trailer of some awesome Indian dance performances on stage that DO look great & I'd love to learn, but they are not on this dvd.
This is different from their old set, this one is smaller & the twins speak during with several aerobic instructor looking backup guys & girls.
It has a 6 min warmup that was stiff in my opinion, but had some good horse stance & twists.
There are 3 routines you build up to & it's taught in the usual learn one movment, learn another, repeat, learn another, repeat... The twins take turns teaching & do quite well, though not as in depth as they used to like their old bellydance dvds. When you first learn, they do it slow & build up to it's correct speed.
The moves themselves are, I agree with Erica's review...  silly & stiff. Like a modern version of 80s aerobics. A lot of hopping, kicking & moving hands for no other reason then to expend energy. Yes, you cannot do this anywhere but on stage becasue you're being paid to.
The cool down has some nice yoga stretches like pigeon, twisted sage, usual sitting forward bend, etc. but for only a few min. The entire workout is 33 min.
I gave it a few stars for the same reason another reviewer did. You will get a workout with all the hopping & the twins do teach well & some people  will like the moves, just not my style.

You can see a trailer at collagevideo com & also look on youtube",1159056000,8,1622,4.209003215434084
