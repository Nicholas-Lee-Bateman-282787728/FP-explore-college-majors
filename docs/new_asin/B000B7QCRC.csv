My older son watched it all the time when he was 5, and he still watches it now, at least once a month. He and my 6 year old wish the tv show would come back. I am going to purchase the other two dvds for them, they really do watch them often, and really enjoy the crazy aliens and the silly things they do. I feel this is a very good purchase for young boys, there is no bad language or teen-age stuff in it, and that is very hard to find these days.",1325116800,,527,3.7142857142857144
8082991,3,B000B7QCRC,"That's all I can say about this ""Pet Alien"" DVD: ""WHOA...""  That's because the four episodes in this DVD have titles that end with ""of Doom"", hence the DVD title.  Either way, there's more spacey shennanigans with Tommy Cadle and his alien friends.

Here's the lowdown of these co-incidental episodes:

""Crater of Doom"" is about Tommy getting a hideous pimple on School Picture Day.  ""Sounds of Doom"" involves Tommy being forced to take accordion lessons.  ""Box of Doom"" has Dinko and company discovering a strange locked-up box in Tommy's basement, and fear what's inside it.  In ""Doctor of Doom"", Tommy doesn't want to go to the doctor, which gives Dinko another harebrained idea.

If this DVD isn't part of your ""Pet Alien"" collection, you're doomed, too.",1139702400,,758,4.9603174603174605
8082992,5,B000B7QCRC,"Lighter Side of Doom is the 3rd and latest DVD title that Pet Alien has out.

If you don't know Pet Alien yet, it's a 3D animated series with aliens who fell down from outerspace and now living with their new friend, a young boy called Tommy. Tommy wanted to live a boring simple life, but when he encountered the aliens, his plans were dommed. Each of the characters have specific personalities: Dinko always wants to help TOmmy of Earth, Gumpers is a big gorilla-like alien who loves to eath, but is scared of everything (Haha) and ear-farts making the whole lighthouse smell, Flip is a hyper bird-looking alien who loves to play tricks on Swanky, Swanky loves owning things and secretly wants Tommy's lighthouse to make it into a hotel, and finally Scruffy (the dog-alien)wants to protect all of them (Tommy included) from danger and possesses a super long tongue that has a mind of its own.

It's the perfect recipe for edgy wacky episodes.",1134691200,4,944,4.680722891566265
