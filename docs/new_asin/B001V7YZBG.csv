3819321,5,B001V7YZBG,"I was a little apprehensive about getting three workout dvds I'd never tried before but I'm so glad I did.  This is crazy fun.  After finishing just one 15 minutes workout segment my legs were on fire, but I didn't care at all because I ended feeling exhilarated, excited, and enlivened after only 15 minutes!  I'm not in the best of shape so it's certainly a push for me, but it was really enjoyable.  I'm definitely going to have to invest in a better sports bra, though!",1264809600,23,473,4.402298850574713
3819322,5,B001V7YZBG,"I got this video for my wife and she loves it. She even got me to try it a few times. It is a moderately intense workout however is still fun and upbeat.

3819404,5,B001V7YZBG,"On days I can't seem to drag myself to the gym, this DVD provides at excellent workout from home. Best of all, it's actually fun to do! Finally, a DVD workout I enjoy!",1399248000,,167,4.090909090909091
3819405,5,B001V7YZBG,Love it! Such a great fun workout! Doesn't even feel like a workout feels like a dance party! I totally recommend this.,1395619200,,119,4.454545454545454
3819406,5,B001V7YZBG,"I have had this for about five months now.  The time goes by real fast, it's fun, and best of all it works.",1379462400,,107,3.652173913043478
3819407,3,B001V7YZBG,I would rate this higher because it is a good workout but I think I am more acustom to popular or Latin music. I would recommend it though.,1356307200,,139,4.0
3819408,2,B001V7YZBG,I love to do workout videos at home and I am always looking to add to my collection and have greater variety.  Hemalayaa seems like she is trying to sell sex more than an actual work out. She gives the camera coy little looks and it kind of gives me the hee-be gee-be's. As far as it getting my heart pumping - just didn't cut it.  I also very much dislike it when the directions are voiced over - instead of the people in the video doing the speaking.  It makes it harder for me to feel connected.,1322092800,4,498,4.061224489795919
3819409,5,B001V7YZBG,"I love, love, love all three of these DVDs.  It worked me a lot harder than I expected.  I work these in with walking and jogging in my exercise routine and I still get soar after doing them.  It works parts of my body that I wouldn't work out otherwise.  Plus they're fun and up beat.  My favorite is the basic dance workout one.  I'll probably end up buying all Hemalayaa's DVDs at some point.",1289692800,3,395,4.2
3819410,4,B001V7YZBG,"I recommend this seller for shipping times. The delivery of the DVDs was prompt and the DVDs arrived in excellent condition.
The workouts are definitely unique and for a person who works out at home, it's good to have variety in an exercise routine. The workouts aren't filmed as professionally as other workouts I use but I really like the dance element of this workout. I'm not sure that I would use these exclusively, but I absolutely recommend them in addition to a more traditional workout routine.",1287273600,2,503,4.793103448275862
3819411,5,B001V7YZBG,"I ordered these DVDs after doing some of Hemalayaa's workouts shown on FitTV.  The show times for the workouts on my cable provider were so sporadic that I decided to purchase the DVDs myself and give it a whirl.  I was a little skeptical at first because I always buy fitness DVDs and then tend to get burned out on them.  This one, however, with its three separate DVD workout routines doesn't get old.  I use them about three times a week and rotate the DVDs.  The nice thing about this product is that each DVD has the option to select individual workouts and mix them up, so you never get bored.

I love dancing (specifically Bollywood and bhangra dancing) as exercise because it combines cardio with toning, grace, and posture.  The cool down sessions on these DVDs are like mini-yoga lessons that allow me to ease from workout back to my day smoothly.  The only downside (and it doesn't even really apply to me) is that some of the dance moves can be hard on the knees and hips.  Hemalayaa does, however, allow for different fitness levels by saying things like, ""Do only what your body tells you to do.""  You can always modify the workouts to be comfortable for you.

All in all I highly recommend Hemalayaa's Bollywood Dance Workouts because the dances never get old, the cool down sessions are relaxing, and, most of all, the routines are fun!  When I use these DVDs, I tend to even forget I'm working out.",1272326400,42,1416,4.509803921568627
3819412,3,B001V7YZBG,I have yet to tried the tape. But what I saw it appeared to be easy. I like the music and the fact that you do not have to be an expert in the dance to do it.,1265846400,,158,3.1842105263157894
3819413,5,B001V7YZBG,I purchased this workout set of 3 DVDs because I had been so satisfied with their quality. I had tried 2 of the 3 DVDs by first renting them from Netflix prior to purchasing the package.  I've enjoyed watching Bollywood films and thought the dancing looked fun. It really gives you quite a work out.,1265500800,4,299,4.4363636363636365

8345596,5,B001V7YZBG,"I love watching Bollywood movies, and with this video I feel like I am participating in some of those awesome musical numbers! I find it a great stress reliever too because it is fun but also a great workout. I'm pretty fit but I have some minor back issues, so I can't do every move she does, but I just modify it to fit my needs. This is a nice collection too - lots of variety.",1438560000,2,380,4.0131578947368425
8345597,3,B001V7YZBG,"To me, this seemed like a traditional aerobic video except it adds some sexy hip and shoulder movements which require coordination, which apparently I don't have!  Although many times I wasn't able to progress to the more difficult movements because of my lack of coordination, I kept doing the easier movements and did get a nice aerobic workout from it.  Perhaps this is a video which gets more fun as you practice.  I will try it again and update my review if I enjoy it more with practice.  Of the three, I have only tried the dance workout video.",1434931200,,551,4.5353535353535355
8345598,5,B001V7YZBG,Got this for my mom as one of her Christmas presents and she still talks about how much she loves it. I've tried it too and it's a lot of fun. You definitely work up a sweat but it's not so intensive that you're dripping haha.,1428624000,,226,3.9347826086956523
