8144389,3,B000I8OOHY,"With a wacky offbeat plot, and some goofy characters, you may not be sure just where the horror/comedy Cutting Room (2006) is headed.  While you may not be very frightened, hopefully at the finish you will at least be mildly entertained by the violence, and the film's semi-serious tone.

Charles Drake (Weetus Cren) is a movie producer struggling get his new horror flick made.  Writer Ed Smith (Mark Elias) is still hammering out the screenplay.  Drake, Smith, and casting director Joanne Kramer (Elizabeth Daily) are trying to complete casting for the film, and get big star Brock Steele (Dimitri Lekkos) signed to play the lead.  Drake is under pressure to sign Steele, because he's the one that Steve (Richard T. Jones), the film's distributor wants in the film.

Things don't go well for Drake, as Steele decides to work on another project, and then is mysteriously murdered, so Drake has to go with sitcom star Nicky Dorfman (Garrison Koch) instead.  Next, Steele's agent Sandy Grossman (Jon Polito) is strangled in his office.  About the only positive development is the casting of Drake's airheaded assistant Mindy (Lindsay Labrum) as one of the victims in the film, because of her ability to scream.

A spoof similar in spirit to the program Sledgehammer, Cutting Room utilizes a lot of weird camera angles, and features an assortment of weird cartoonish characters using dizzy sounding dialog, and then bumps some them off in bizarre or semi-stylized fashion.  The police are involved, but no serious attempt is made to solve the crime.  Eventually with Drake turning investigator, the action narrows down to the production offices at the movie studio, for an ending with a twist.  If a very lightweight campy killing spree doesn't tickle your fancy, you probably won't find this film to your liking.  The acting is overplayed, and the exaggerated attempts at humor, not always effective.  Although the production values are decent, the quirky style of cinematography is overdone a bit.",1318636800,2,1997,5.0672782874617734
8144390,1,B000I8OOHY,"Good God, you people are easy to please. I just watched this movie last night, and I can't believe that, although there are only a handful of reviews, they are all positive; in fact, they're all practically glowing. I suppose it's true that the world - not just America, mind you - has been effectively dumbed down by Hollywood and bad indie filmmakers.

This film-within-a-film does not work on any level. As a horror movie, there are only a couple decent deaths (the best involving some tainted hair gel) and nearly all are practically bloodless, as they are shot in silhouette, occur offscreen or are, simply, low-key. As a parody, the movie's humor is forced and unfunny, while the movie skewers horror movie characters as opposed to horror movies themselves. The characters are irritating losers, and the killer is obvious from the beginning. Richard T. Jones and Jon Polito are the only standouts in a miserable cast, but they can't save a script destined for the bonfire.

Nearly all the action takes place within the confines of a production warehouse, complete with flickering lights, long boring corridors and dark cluttered rooms. The lighting and effects are generic and uninspired. More time is spent watching the producer watching other characters than watching a story play out.",1317772800,,1293,5.0093023255813955
8144391,5,B000I8OOHY,A tongue-in-cheek slasher comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously. A cult classic to-be. Cutting Room - watch it!,1233705600,2,119,5.315789473684211
8144392,4,B000I8OOHY,"My longtime friend Weetus Cren stars in this slasher spoof about the movie-making business so my review is most likely biased. However i have long been a fan of obscure film whether it be the heralded foreign film- anime- grindhouse- Corman styled b movie and the low budget independant project. This movie fits somewhere between a B-movie and an exploitation comedy horror. What saves this film is the tongue in cheek performances,  great colors, and quirky camera angles and cinematography. Everyone looks like they're enjoying themselves and many including Mr Weetus Cren give over the top expressions that make you laugh. All in all its a professional wellmade low budget film that is better than alot of films that try to do this type of film. Theres a few faces youve seen on tv or other films and at onetime Bruce Cambell was being approached to participate, but in the end its held by many firsttime actors and handled well!",1209859200,,932,4.825
8144393,5,B000I8OOHY,"Comedy in a Horror flick? Yep and there's no stopping this film from becoming a cult classic - Richard T. Jones and John Polito were superb, just great to see them bring those characters to life. Buy it and rent it!",1164067200,2,215,4.2682926829268295
8144394,5,B000I8OOHY,"I went to a screening of Cutting Room a couple of months and I was extremely pleased to finally see a cool horror movie which doesn't take itself too seriously and pokes fun at the whole ""Hollywood machine"", I'm very happy to see that it's finally coming out on DVD.

The characters are incredibly twisted and intriguing, and you won't see the twist coming.  I really enjoyed sitting through the film and watching as the bizarre story unfolded.

DVD's on my wish list and I can't wait until October 17!",1158710400,5,502,4.555555555555555
