6609599,4,B00N4W4YNA,"If I Stay (R. J. Cutler, 2014)

R. J. Cutler is known for his documentaries; 2009's The September Issue garnered raves on the festival circuit. Now he turns in his first big-screen feature, and a movie more different than The September Issue you are unlikely to find this year. If I Stay was adapted from Gayle Forman's novel by Shauna Cross, whose output to date has been, well, somewhat underwhelming (Whip It, What to Expect When You're Expecting). I'm not entirely sure what happened, but sticking this script to this director caused some form of magic to happen. How good is this magic? According to my spreadsheet, If I Stay is the three hundredth film I have seen so far in 2014. It is the fifteenth of those to get a rating of four stars or higher (as I write this opening paragraph, I am not yet sure if I'm going 4 or 4.5). Less than half of them have been features (the rest are shorts). This is, in a word, a stunning film.

Plot: Mia Hall (Let Me In's Chlo Grace Moretz) is a teenager. Her life is nothing special, save that it's a few levels above the rest of us; she's currently waiting to hear if she got in to Juilliard, her boyfriend's band is the hottest thing in Oregon, she doesn't hate her family and vice-versa. Everything is going along as usual until, on a routine car trip, her family is involved in an accident and Mia winds up in a coma. The remainder of the movie is told in split storylinesMia flashes back to the events of the past year and a half, during her relationship with Adam (The Fifth Estate's Jamie Blackley), and we also see scenes from the hospital, as Mia wrestles with the question of whether to fight for her own life or let go and walk out the door into the ever-beckoning light.

My synopsis of the movie makes it sound horribly cheesy. (This is one of the many reasons I never get too far when I attempt fiction.) It is anything but. While it is, on the surface, a romance, there are two ways in which it is markedly different than most romances, both teen and adult, you've seen on the screen. First, it's real. The chemistry between Moretz and Blackley sizzles, but there is the requisite awkwardness without the script ever going overboard. This is a textbook on how to write a first romance, Mary and Max-level stuff, in many ways. Second, while the romance is always therethe film's first flashback is of Adam first taking notice of Mia as she practices the cello in her high school's band roomthe romance angle never overhwelms the movie's other relationships. Mia's family are well-developed, strong characters; The Tall Man's Jacob Davies, as Mia's younger brother, turns in a star-making performance, while Stacy Keach may not have been this good since Southern Comfort in 1981. (Keach's monologue about three-quarters of the way through the film is one of its high points.) In a lot of ways, this is about as good as movies about human relationships get. As a yardstick when I say that, I will also mention that as of this writing, seven of my top ten films of all time have the exploration of interpersonal relationships as either the main thrust or a major subplot: Before Night Falls, Hotaru no Haka, Closetland, Ikiru, Jeux Interdits, Persona, and The Manchurian Candidate.

Balancing out the great things about this movie (and I use the term great in its classical sense here) are two quibbles. One of them is probably minor no matter who you are. The second may be just as minor, or it may be something that hamstrings the entire movie for you. It is this second point that has been causing me so much consternation since I saw the movie last night. I will try and talk about both without spoilers, but if you're not reading this at var.ev., imagine there's a big stop sign right below these words.

First off is Mia's audition. She nails it. It is sterling. Technically and conceptually flawless. She says in a later scene that she knows she has never played that well in her life. All of which leads to the somewhat inescapable conclusion that, during the time between her audition and finding out whether or not she gets into Juilliard, Mia should be supremely confident that there is no way the answer is no. And yet, her anxiety over whether she is getting into Juilliard is one of the defining facets of her character. There are reasonable explanations, but it wouldn't have been too hard to underline any of them in the script without sacrificing the rest of Mia's character. Second is the final fifteen seconds of the film. Without explicitly stating what happens, it is difficult to explain what it is about those final two shots that makes them, potentially, hamstring the entire film. (And I should add that, to be fair to Cutler and Cross, this seems to be a flaw in the source material that was simply transferred over to the film, but it is of course possible that it is handled better in the novel.) I will try by saying that where I was singing the film's praises earlier for not being a typical cheesy romance, those final two shots undo a portion of that workhow much will probably depend on the individual viewerby resolving the film in a typical-cheesy-romance way, and thus ultimately turning the movie into what it had spent the last hundred five minutes trying so deperately to avoid being, and largely succeeding in that goal.

Neither of these things, no matter how much the end of the film undercuts it for you, should be construed in any way as reasons not to see this movie. It is excellent on almost every level, and I cannot recommend it highly enough, whether you have a teenager to take with you or not (my wife and I went without one, and we were far from the only people in the theater without teens in tow). Do yourself a favor and take a pack of tissues with you; if this one doesn't give you the sniffles, it's possible you're dead. ****",1415577600,2,5839,4.5456273764258555
6609600,4,B00N4W4YNA,"One snowy morning, shy and talented cellist Mia Hall (Chlo Grace Moretz) is in a car crash with her father, mother, and brother.  Her parents both die.  She rouses on the roadside in a type of spiritual grey zone, observing from a few feet away as paramedics treat her bloodied and bruised physical self before spiriting her to the hospital in an ambulance.  A nurse whispers a declaration of dubious medical value in her ear:  it is Mia's choice whether she lives and comes out of her coma or slips away into death.  It is an intriguing, yet also fairly corny scenario, but, in a surprise twist, If I Stay as a film rises above it.  Part of the reason for this is a non-chronological structure emphasizing Mia's past, including her close relationship with her parents (both down-to-earth former hipsters gone soft and suburban) and her profound, tempestuous love with an ambitious local singer and guitarist.  Set in scenic, overcast Portlandthe stomping ground of, among others, My Own Private Idaho director Gus Van Sant and the Shinsthe film unfolds first and foremost as a delicate and touching story of teenage love and adolescent indecision, and it is grounded by the elegant and humane performances delivered by both the youthful stars and the veterans of the ensemble, including the always welcome Stacy Keach as Mia's grandfather, tearing into a pained monologue by her hospital bedside.  It is relatively easy then to invest in the charismatic characters and their intimate world.  So, by extension, I found myself interested after all in the outcome of the farfetched supernatural framing device.",1411776000,3,1608,4.992509363295881
6609601,5,B00N4W4YNA,"Following the trend of teen books being adapted to movies, comes ""If I Stay"". I didn't read the book, but the trailer seemed compelling enough to drag me to the theater. The trailer shows the film as a love story like a huge summer hit like ""The Fault in our Stars"", but there's a twist. The movie cuts deeper than just a love story, and we get to see how not only a young girl's life  instantly changes by a car accident, but also how it affects the people that surrounds her, like her other relatives, her friends, and her boyfriend. There's a twist: she falls into a coma, but she still can see her relatives, friends suffering for her at the hospital where she's in. This surely guarantees a lot of tears, so if you haven't watched it, get some tissues. This one will make you cry.

The movie is told in such a refreshing way, filled of flashbacks where we see how was her life before the accident, like finding her first love, her audition to Julliard, among other events of a typical life. I wasn't expect it to like it so much, and I dare to say that it's even better than TFIOS (you know it will always be compared to that one), Chlo Grace Moretz is such a talented young actress, you believe her performance from beginning to end, and the supporting cast is great as well. There's great music from great musicians, from indie, to classical music(get the soundtrack!), and good songs from the fictional band, Willamette Stone.

I read the book after the movie, and I can say it's a faithful adaptation and readers from the book and non-readers will enjoy it. After the film ends, you get to appreciate more life, and this movie will change a lot of lives. Can't wait to get it on Blu-Ray! Hope it's filled with bonus features. It's worth the pre-order, for sure.",1411689600,70,1770,4.423312883435583
6609602,5,B00N4W4YNA,"I just finished reading Gayle Formans If I Stay last night. While emotionally manipulative and lacking closure, I loved it. It was the kind of book I was able to tear through in a day. I loved the main character and didn't feel like I was reading about a stupid person when reading her narration, something I cant say for many young adult novel perspectives Ive witnessed in the past (Im lookin at you, Stephanie Meyer.) With the book still very fresh in my mind, I saw the film today.

Chloe Grace Moretz is a fantastic young star, and she will become this generations Julia Roberts, Im positively sure of it. However, filmmakers need to stop casting her in mousy geek-girl parts. She was simply too pretty to play Stephen Kings Carrie last year, and shes too pretty to play If I Stays Mia. But, the girl can act!

""If I Stay"" follows Mia, a young cellist who could very well be going to Julliard School of Music in the fall. Her parents (Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard) are rockers from the old days who reluctantly grew up when they had Mia and her brother Teddy. Mias boyfriend of some time, musician Adam (Jamie Blackley) is bitter about how their lives going in different directions, without one another. One fateful day, when Mia is expecting a potential acceptance letter from Julliard, a terrible car crash takes both of Mias parents, leaving Mias spirit seeing her worst nightmare unfold before her very eyes, unable to do anything about it, lying in a coma. Although, she may possess all the power - the nurse tells her, ""youre running the show, they're all waiting on you.""

""If I Stay"" will unfairly be compared to the summers other weepy teen romance, ""The Fault in Our Stars."" The two movies (and books) are constructed in completely different ways. Both will tug at the heartstrings and probably make the audience cry when it counts, but for different reasons. ""If I Stay"" is more manipulative, however, because of the way the story is told, which is identical to the book. The car crash is the first scene, and the back story is told in flashbacks, which felt like a refreshing structure.

Moretz is a very talented young actress, and I think shes getting better every part I see her in. She works hard to nail the big dramatic moments that are so crucial to how this movie plays out. She has an easy chemistry with all of her co-stars, especially Blackley, who could possibly have a very bright career in music ahead of him. You root for their relationship even when they treat each other like crap. Enos is great, also, as Mias mother. The parents are portrayed as confidants, and not the borderline antagonists that they sometimes are in YA novels.

""If I Stay"" is remarkably faithful to the book, with only positive changes made. There weren't any scenes or characters missing from the film that I particularly missed. Its emotionally exhausting, but uplifting and hopeful in all the ways it should be. Its a nice reminder to watch the way you look at life, to appreciate the little things, because it could all be gone in an instant.

6609603,4,B00N4W4YNA,"Mia Hall (Chlo Grace Moretz) has a wonderful family, in love with Adam (Jamie Blackley) who plays in a band, and she is a candidate for Julliard. The next thing you know, she is in a coma and we all have Puff moments as she examines her life and can see what is happening in the hospital as a soul or spirit. Mia must make the mental decision to recover or move on and follow the light. With much of her life destroyed, she asks the question of what will she have ""If I Stay.""

The film is filled with all the joyous melancholy of a teen girl's life (hint: target audience). For people who couldn't cry enough over ""The Fault In Our Stars"" this film is here to help wrangle that last bit of moisture from your tear duct. Mom (Mireille Enos) explains life to Mia while doing dishes and inspired the title for my review.

Actors gave a good performance for a script that was a bit formulaic. Newcomer Ali Milner did an excellent job as Liz, the friend.

6609604,4,B00N4W4YNA,"""If I Stay"" (2014 release; 106 min.) is the big screen adaptation of the YA novel of the same name by Gayle Forman. As the movie opens, we are introduced to Mia (played by Chlo Grace Moretz), a HS junior, and her family (mom and dad and her little brother Teddy). We are also introduced to Adam (played by Jamie Bleckley), a senior whose indie band is getting noticed in and around Portland. Mia, on the other hand, is a cellist. Then, about 10 minutes into the movie, Mia and her family are involved in a terrible head-on car collusion. The rest of the movie plays out at the hospital and in flashbacks. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience of this plot-heavy movie, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first , this is the debut fiction feature for director R.J. Cutler, a long time Award-winning documentarian, who has bought us move like The War Room, The September Issue, and American High. ""If I Stay"" couldn't be further away from any of those. Second, music plays a HUGE role in the movie, both rock and classical. Mia is quasi-obsessed with her cello, and it provides an out for her insecurities of not belonging. And while I enjoyed a lot of the (indie) music that is featured in the movie, there are way too many 'cool' music references in the movie (Adam wearing a Sonic Youth T, Mia's dad having a Husker Du poster in his study room, Mia dressing up as Debbie Harry, etc. etc. it just doesn't stop). There is such as thing as overkill, and it made the movie feel less authentic, rather than more authentic. Third, there are some great performances in the movie, none more so than Chlo Grace Moretz, a 17 yr. old playing a 17 yr. old, imagine that! (Compare that to the recent ""Breathe In"", where Felicity Jones, in real life in her late 20, plays a HS exchange student). Blackley is okay as Adam, and his singing is decent. But the best performance actually comes from Stacey Keach, as Mia's 'gramps' (check out the scene in his pick-up truck when he drops Mia off at her house). Last but not least, there is a nice soundtrack for this movie, available here on Amazon, with a bunch of nice sounding indie music as well as 4 or 5 songs from the fictitious band fronted by Adam. The ""deluxe"" version also brings some of the classical music featured in the movie.

The movie opened about a month ago in late August here in Cincinnati and the matinee screening where I saw this at today was attended okay but not great. Not surprisingly, the audience was overwhelmingly female. I ended up enjoying the movie more than I expected. Regardless of your age, if you don't care much for music, I'd stay away from this, as music plays front and center. Bottom line: if you are in the mood for something different that the endless stream of action movies and comic book super heroes that Hollywood has been throwing at us this summer, I'd suggest you check this out, be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1411603200,41,2966,4.470479704797048

6609632,3,B00N4W4YNA,"If I Stay is, without shame, a picture aimed straight at the tear ducts, presumably in the belief that a good crying spell is therapeutic, and cathartic for the spirit. And the picture mostly works hard to earn its tears honestly: The characters are attractive and appealing and likable, and the actors playing the characters also are attractive and likable.  This is the rare picture which features no bad guys.  Everybodys a good guy.

Based on Gayle Formans 2009 young adult novel of the same name, If I Stay chronicles the emotional experience of buttoned-up 17-year-old cello prodigy Mia Hall and her worlds-colliding romance with a free-spirited, up-and-coming young rock-and-roll guitarist named Adam.  That both Mia and Adam are on the cusp of professional breakthroughs in their musical pursuits accounts for most the of the ups and downs in their relationship.

Unfortunately, their romance is in the middle of one of its downs when Mia and her family are involved in a catatrophic auto accident, casting Mia into an out-of-body experience in which she can observe the people she loves but not communicate with them or interfere with their actions.

If I Stay is a picture that gives you the kind of satisfaction you get from following your doctor's orders, eating the right cerial, taking your medicine as prescribed, or getting a flu shot: You might rather be watching Guardians of the Galaxy of The Expendibles, but you just know that a movie with this much cello music in it has to be good for you.

And it is fairly good.  Young Mia has wonderful support from her parents, a set of amiable former rockers played appealingly by Mirielle Enos and Joshua Leonard.  Mias folks grew up and embraced responsibility when it became apparent to them that the late nights and party lights did not blend well with parenthoodan epiphany which makes even more perplexing their almost pushing young Mia out the door to be with her rocker boyfriend.

As Mias rock guitarist boyfriend, Jamie Blackley is somehow manages to be sullen without being pouty, simultaneously withdrawn and inarticulate about romance yet strong-willed and verbose about music.  You can see why Mias attracted to Adam, but if you're like me, you might be more than a little conflicted about their falling into bed quite so quickly.

Unfortunately, at some pointIm not exactly not sure when, but I think it's about an hour into the picturethe narrative becomes sticky and manipulative, and the picture begins to rely on broad characterizations, familiar stereotypes, and the ghosts of movies past to sort of swindle the tears from the audience.

And that's too bad, because by that point I'd already decided I enjoyed the picture, and was unprepared to modify my opinion.  That the scene which I believe began the manipulation featured the showcase moment for veteran actor Stacy Keach, as the crusty and lovable old Grandpa, made the cheat seem even more unexpected.  Keach, much like Robert Loggia, always seems such an honest and dependable actor.

Having said that, about 80% of the success of If I Stay belongs to young Chloe Grace Moretz in the central role as Mia.  Moretz is earnest enough in her craft to make us care about young Mia even through her most puzzling and selfish interludes.

A couple of weeks after the premiere, young Moretz also appeared in the high-profile action film 'The Equalizer,' starring Denzel Washington, as a victimized teenaged prostitute, a role which couldn't possibly have been further removed from her characterization in 'If I Stay.'  And combined with If I Stay, 'The Equalizer,' and Moretz affecting characterization in the title role of the previous year's remake of Carrie, it was more than plain even then that this was one young actress who was really going places.  Fast.

6609643,5,B00N4W4YNA,"A lot of people watch this and see devastation. It's actually an accurate story about life. We all want a happy ending, a miracle, life to go on as it was and things that happen in our lives no matter how tragic, to be a bad memory. Unfortunately no one tells you for every happiness there is a tragedy right behind it. I'm now 45 years old , a mother of 3 amazing, beautiful, kind children, who's lives we perfect, besides the normal bumps in the road high school can bring. Everything seems life altering at that age, you can't see past that day, and don't understand why. I've always been open and honest with my kids about everything, but I didn't have time to prepare them for their next step into adulthood and tragedy struck, and then again, and again, and again, it hasn't stopped. I do not take the word tragedy lightly, their lives exploded to put it honestly. They handled everything with grace and dignity, and put everyone else first as always,that's beauty. Live life, love life, if you can keep God close, and feel the prayers being said for you, because someone is always praying for you even though you don't know it. Sometimes I wish someone would have told me that every time your happy and start to think everything is going to be ok, that's when you get knocked down, sometimes you can get right back up, and sometimes it's so unreal it knocks the wind out of you and changes you and your life forever. There's no going back, it's just a distant memory, but remember you still have those memories and you have a whole life ahead that is meant to make more. Get up, smile a little, live life, love deeply and breathe because no matter how awful and heartbreaking life will be, you still have the amazing parts to live. And never forget your not alone, we are all holding you up.",1491696000,,1798,4.418674698795181

6609985,3,B00N4W4YNA,Its a teenage love story......thought there would be more wisdom and thought provoking enlightenment.  Cello is a cool instrument but not enough of cello's depth.  ....a lot of head banging short spurts and a rather unbelievable family set-up. It was distracting. I suppose they were trying to highlight the differences in musical instruments and therefore the personality differences; but again here there was no depth.  But must have been written by teenagers; I don't recommend it unless you're bored.,1484784000,2,504,5.3544303797468356

The two main characters had really good chemistry and their love story was believable.  Jamie Blackley is REALLY easy on the eyes and I like the way he carries himself.  But my most favorite parts of the movie were the scenes with the family together and extended family joining them - kind of makes you wish you had such a dream family that truly enjoyed each other's company.  The setting was cool (neat old homes/neighborhoods).  If you watch the movie, get ready to love the movie and shed lots of tears at the same time!

I'm happy I didn't pay twenty bucks to buy it because it was just a stereotypical movie that I thought would have some great moving ending. I could only laugh. It started out okay and just went downhill from half an hour in. I had no trouble leaving and letting the movie go for a ten minutes because it was so predictable.

But the later choice is harder than the former, especially for Mia, a girl who always hides herself in the shell at first when she faces any difficulties. In the beginning, she have no motives to live on because her parents are died, and the conflict between her loved one and her dream school seems like a endless mess that can never be worked out. Though Mia is hard to face the trauma by herself, she is lucky to have so many people to love her, support her and sacrifice for her. In return, Mia turns her head back from the path of death and lives on with all her courage. That's why the movie is so touching.",1475366400,2,726,4.192857142857143

6610921,5,B00N4W4YNA,"If I stay is a beautiful, moving film about a teenage girl and the life or death decision she must make. Mia is a teenage girl that has a wonderful, quirky family, a boyfriend who loves her to pieces, and a bright, ambitious future.
But, all of that changes when she and her family are in a fatal car accident. While Mia's body is in a coma, her mind journeys back to all of her memories, triumphs, heart breaks and future. She has to make the decision on whether or not to fight and stay alive, or let go and leave this world. Will Mia stay?
I love this movie. It made me laugh, cry and it helped me to see all of the good in my own life that I should cherish, because you never know when it could all change. The cinematography is beautiful. Most of the film is filled with memories that Mia has and the way they are portrayed is very neat. The music is also beautiful. Mia is a cellist and a lot of the film focuses on her dreams of becoming a successful musician, so the film is filled with beautiful classical music.
My Favorite character is Mia played by Chloe Moretz. This film shows so many aspects of Mia's life, so it's easy to find something to relate to. She has a great passion for playing the cello and dedicates most of her life to it. She has difficulties relating to her parents and even her boyfriend since their musicals tastes are far more edgy than hers. She has to face her insane loss and she has to choose between many different things in life. There's something about her life that I think anyone can relate to, so she's a wonderful character. Chloe does a wonderful job portraying everything she's going through and she moved me to tears many times.
This film makes me think about my own family and everything I would do for them. It makes me think of my life and all the joys and sorrows I've faced. There was not a dry eye in the audience because this film provokes unique memories for every individual. I felt especially connected to Mia's family because I too have a younger brother and am very close with my parents, so I was very touched by Mia's situation.
I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18 because of the intense emotions and mature content",1474243200,3,2209,4.261904761904762

She prefers happy endings that show a definite conclusion instead of making you ask questions and wondering what happened past that last moment.

A typical teen love story with all the usual angst, break-ups, self-exploration, more angst, arguments, bad boy/good girl dynamics, angst, etc..  Then it suddenly shifts gears and an unexpected paranormal element takes over the story.  Probably interesting to mature teens and young adults but for me it was interminably dull...I actually started checking my emails out of sheer boredom during the cello recitals or whatever that humongous instrument is that she plays.  I know, I could have stopped watching and ended the torture but I have a compulsion to finish books and movies that I start.  Does she stay or does she go?

Coming from a huge movie buff, that's a pretty hard category to fall in since there have been so many movies made!!! I'm all for a great twist or a surprise ending but they failed miserably!! I don't want to give spoilers for those who haven't seen it and you may very well love the movie yourself. But to me they did the exact opposite of what should've been done. I almost wrote the studio demanding my ticket money back!! I left so mad!!! So shame on you New Line and MGM shame on you for producing this crap movie!!",1469923200,,888,4.1686046511627906
