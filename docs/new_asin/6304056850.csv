775437,3,6304056850,"You know any movie that starts with John Carradine being blown to bits is destined for greatness. He plays a scientist playing with nuclear materials (didn't every '50s movie scientist do that?) who winds up extremely dead.  He doesn't stay down for long, though. His corpse pays a visit to a fellow  scientist and makes a rather stunning announcement: The corpse is occupied  by an alien being, and the rest of his alien beings are gonna invade in 24  hours if Earth doesn't surrender. Well, Earth doesn't surrender, the  scientist friend looks like a total loon, and the invasion begins. Lots of  stock footage of stuff blowing up and collapsing follows, and the invisible  aliens follow an unusual strategy: They possess the bodies of the recently  dead and invade sporting events (represented, again, by much stock  footage), spreading their message of surrender and impending doom. The  scientist friend, his lovely daughter (Jean Byron) and another scientist  (Robert Hutton) head out to the desert to work on a way to knock off the  aliens, still wrecking havoc via stock footage. The party of three hooks up  with John Agar, doing his best John Wayne impersonation, and they spend the  rest of the movie dodging the walking dead and working on wiping the bad  boys out.
This is all about as dumb as it sounds. The dead are sort of  creepy, in a pre-Night-of-the-Living-Dead kind of way, but this flick was  made on the cheap, so sets are minimal, acting is bad, and about half of  the film is stock footage padding. In other words, it's totally  entertaining.",956966400,24,1567,4.823308270676692

775680,5,6304056850,"I upgraded to the bluray of this film not because it merited being seen in higher definition, but rather because my all-time favorite old horror movie historian Tom Weaver did the commentary track.  Interestingly, he actually begins by saying he hates this movie.  He gives us the usual cool information behind the production you're not likely to get from many other specialists of these sorts of films, but he just takes no pleasure in the end result.  (And this from someone who likes Attack of the Crab Monsters!)  So, in light of all this, let me make my case to the contrary.  This little stinker was filmed in under a week.  And nobody was lavishing the production with planeloads of cash.  In the realm of goofy, low-budge retreads, Invisible Invaders has John Carradine and John Agar, that cool invisible feet shuffling through sand effect, lumbering corpses, and a military hero who shoots an out-of-control civilian.  With nothing but respect for Tom Weaver's knowledge and (for that matter) taste, let me submit that there's actually some fun to be had.  (And after Mr. Weaver pointed out that the lab where Carradine blows himself up is identical to the lab later in the movie, and that our heroes get UN recognition while seated in . . .aw, hell, I'm not giving that away--listen to the commentary track--Invisible Invaders has actually gone up a notch for me.)",1470441600,3,1374,4.837606837606837
775681,4,6304056850,"BOTTOM LINE: While not one of Hollywood's best alien invasion films from the good old days, it's far from the worst. Fans of fantastic cinema and low budget sci-fi programmers should be delighted with how terrific this old B flick looks here in hi-def. If you're a fan of such fare then this gorgeous Blu-ray edition of INVISIBLE INVADERS comes highly recommended. 4 STARS

THE STORY (contains major spoilers): Threatened by our nuclear proliferation and newly developed rocket program, paranoid aliens decide to attack Earth before we can take the fight to them. They have the advantage because they're invisible, so do they slip in unseen and swiftly eradicate us? Of course not! They instead opt to inhabit fresh human corpses, maneuver the reanimated bodies into the announcement booths of local sporting events and make vague, non-specific threats. Pretty terrifying, huh? In the meantime, a couple of whitebread science types hidden away in a military bunker struggle to devise a method of stopping the invasion before all mankind is wiped out. The adrenaline-fueled climax features jumpin' John Agar in saggy radiation-proof pajamas, riding atop a radar dish-equipped International Harvester panel wagon that idles aimlessly around the Bronson Canyon area. When an army of Invaders show up, (a few middle-aged white guys in greasepaint wearing dusty three-piece suits who wander about, looking extremely bored), Agar fires the super science weapon developed by the two sequestered scientists: a sonic ray rifle/backpack thingamabob, obviously constructed from PVC pipe, wood and a handful of TV vacuum tubes. With it he stuns the deadly aliens, who promptly collapse and reveal their ""true"" forms, (the monster costume from ""IT! The Terror From Beyond Space,"" optically distorted & blurred). The creatures curl up and dissolve into foaming piles of soapsuds. Sadly, the glowing mothership/saucer at the end of the film is literally a cheesy matte painting, with stock explosion footage superimposed over it.

THOUGHTS: One of the lesser ET invasion flicks from the golden age of sci-fi. The plot is routine, with plenty of head-scratching moments that make you wonder if the screenwriters for this sort of thing ever bothered to proofread their work before submitting it. The mostly set-bound film is jam-packed with wall-to-wall exposition, a poorly-staged fist fight or two, and plenty of stock footage. Thankfully it only assaults us for a little over an hour, though it often feels much longer. And yet there's just something about this film that I like. I picked up a rough-looking copy from PD supplier Sinister Cinema decades ago and, for whatever reason, it got under my skin. (Like a rash, I suppose?) The inclusion of two of low budget sci-fi's best Johns: Agar & Carradine, are likely the strongest reasons for my affinity for INVISIBLE INVADERS. The addition of Brit ex-pat Philp Tonge, (the Macy's manager from 1934's Miracle on 34th Street), gives the flick a touch of class with his sincere, angsty turn as Dr. Adam Penner. Genre thesps Jean Byron and Paul Langton are also on hand to up the B-level star power a touch. The few original F/X shots are kinda cool and the zombie make-ups are effective and surprisingly gruesome for the time period in which these were filmed. Most of the remaining ""action"" comes courtesy of reams of natural disaster stock footage. In all honesty, the best thing about INVISIBLE INVADERS is the flashy trailer for it which, like so many films of this type, promised far more excitement than it actually delivers. But hey, what do you honestly expect from a movie that was slapped together in less than a week?

THE BLU-RAY: One of their strongest efforts yet, the Kino Lorber release of INVISIBLE INVADERS looks stunning, quite frankly. The picture is clean, solid and almost entirely free of dirt & debris. No pixelation, artifacting or edge enhancement was detected. Focus is razor sharp without the crush (video noise) that often results when sharpness is dialed up on older films to maximize picture clarity. The techs at Kino Lorber are either getting really good at achieving a better balance with their remastering process or else they got their hands on a print of the film that was in pristine condition. Audio is clear & level and the soundmix is loud & proud! Bonus features include a full-length audio commentary with film historian Tom Weaver, the film's theatrical trailer and the preview for another recent Kino Lorber Blu-ray release, The Magnetic Monster.",1468972800,7,4526,5.105263157894737
775682,4,6304056850,"The fact that I have upgraded from the DVD to the Blu-ray version of this movie should tell you that I like this movie a lot.

775862,3,6304056850,"Back in the 50s and 60s just about every movie dealing with monsters, aliens, weird phenomena, supernatural, preternatural, and everything in between had one thing in common - Atomic weapons. Radioactive fallout was causing insects and animals to mutate into giant monstrosities, atomic energy was lifting man off the planet tossing us across the stars and into unknown peril, drawing the attention of alien civilization. The ideas were endless. Sometimes good and sometimes not so good. In the case of Invisible Invaders (1959) it wasn't too bad.

Amazon Prime has a slew of old classic science fiction and monster movies and most of them are junk. I'm not trying to disparage anyone childhood memories here but let's be honest, just as it is today, a large portion of the movies made back then weren't very good. One could literally spend hours digging through the catalog searching for a decent movie to watch and come up short. Well today is your lucky day. I've conducted that dive and located a pretty good movie for you.

Invisible Invaders is an alien invasion movie. The concept is straightforward, mankind's development of atomic weapons signals to a super advanced race of invisible aliens that the Earth is now a threat. The aliens arrive, speak with one person who isn't terribly important or in a position of power, and demand worldwide surrender within 24 hours. The aliens are far superior in technology, using cloaking technology to hide themselves and their spacecraft. In order to communicate with humans they reanimate the corpses of the dead. When this fails they use the army of reanimated dead to destroy the Earth.

Watching older films within the genre can be painful or fascinating, or both. Invisible Invaders holds up very well for being fifty-six years old. The screenplay leans on narration to transition through time and location, which is common with older classics. A trite and silly romantic bond is written in for two of the main characters, another staple of classic genre. What's most fascinating is the use of zombies to take over the world. Sure they aren't the fleshing eating kind, and they are all white adult males wearing suits, but the idea is still pretty prophetic when you look at how fascinated media is with zombies today.",1433894400,10,2272,4.958005249343832

775866,3,6304056850,"John Carradine (The Grapes of Wrath, Red Zone Cuba, Legacy of Blood) is a government nuclear scientist  who gets blown up in his chemistry(?) lab in the 1st 30 seconds of the movie. (Yay!) As a result, Dr. Penner, his former colleague, (the evil Macy's psychologist from Miracle on 34th Street) informs a general with Burt Lancaster hair that he must resign as head of the  AEC . He retreats to his home where he resides with his 40-year old daughter (Jean Byron, Patty Duke's mother).

An invisible alien from the moon inhabits Carradine's body, confronts Penner and tells him that unless Earth surrenders, they will leave scuff marks on newly-waxed kitchen and gym hardwood floors everywhere (you only see shots of their feet moving through loose Earth - get it?). And kill everyone. To show they mean business, they rap him on the head with a cane (wait... I think that's another movie).. They compel Penner and his protege, Dr. Lamont (John Waters) to warn Washington of the threat. They are laughed at, and so the aliens elect to go direct with their message. They wisely begin by disabling announcers at hockey games and talking over the mic directly to the fans.
Hockey fans.

Then the aliens open a demolition agency and blow up old factories, bridges, and dams in Holland, Finland, and Russia, releasing floods of stock footage. All of the walking-dead aliens are middle-aged white males in business suits and ties with runny mascara who would not look completely out of place at a CPAC or Log Cabin meeting.

The military dispatches John Agar (Major Jerk, a humorless dolt in a poopie suit who browbeats everyone), to manage the effete, and quite probably, pinko scientists (just like the Manhattan Project!). He and the Penners retreat to a service station / lab inside a cave. Besides beakers with foam in them, there are big machines there with excellent signage employing very large fonts ""Chamber pressure, chamber temperature"", etc. They have less than 24 hours to find a way to stop the invaders.

What's the solution? One word: plastics (acrylic) delivered via spray gun (fire extinguisher). Although it is a Fantastic idea, it doesn't work, and they go on to develop Formula 409. They capture an alien (Don Imus)  and bring it to the lab, placing it in a chamber with high pressure and heat.

During a dramatic(!) moment, John Waters panics (a la ""The Thing"") and attempts to release the alien. In a fist fight with Agar, he manages to land the first three punches, decking him, before he is overcome. (In a fight between a military man and a scientist, always bet on the physicist. Only experimental, not theoretical, physicists, though).

The team discovers that sound makes the aliens visible and forces them out of the corpses. Justin Bieber recordings work the best.

In the end, the UN gets a plug.

In her only action scene, Jean Byron (the daughter) pulls a lever that opens a door.

Better than the average John Agar film.",1430611200,,2950,4.796844181459566

The plot is pretty much PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, although I'm not sure which came first.
In both, advanced alien invaders decide to resurrect and re-animate the corpses of our recently deceased in order to demoralize the Earthlings into abject global surrender.
(this is possibly because they don't have a Twitter or Reddit account).

Well, ummm-kay. The corpses don't have the desired effect-- being dead is apparently a drawback to their credibility.
Things get messy, and there is a lot of conventional knocking down and ray beams and exploding National Monuments and Important Famous Buildings blowing up and getting knocked over. All of this is done with standard stock footage of earthquakes, building demolitions, WW2 street fighting, etc.

In the end, of course, Humanity survives and John Agar gets the girl.

This is a B flick for free streaming-- it's not some timeless classic that you'd ever want to spend money to own.
Make some popcorn and enjoy! Think MST3K, the play-at-home version.

So, they inhabit the bodies of the dead, moving about the landscape, looking pasty and pale, in their very best burial suits.

The alien inhabiting the dead John Carradine appears to the elderly statesman scientist, demanding total surrender of earth to the aliens.  The elderly scientist has a history of advocating for international disarmament.  Thus, the movie teaches us a lesson about being soft on communism, like good sci-fi movies were bound to do in the 1950's.  Then, John Agar, Jean Byron, the scientist, and a soldier who shoots people to keep their mission moving, go to a cave stocked with scientific stuff to  invent a ray gun that  knocks out the zombie-like aliens.

Watching it again I remembered that it was the invisible creature effects that had probably scared me.

Interesting to note, because of the plot, you may say that this is one of the original zombie movies, in that the invisible invaders use the dead as their hosts to rage war on mankind.

When the planet declares the hapless egghead crazy, the interlopers inhabit other cadavers and seize mikes at sports arenas.

Apparently, the invaders prefer suit-wearing males as walking dead.  The litches still shamble as stiffly as Frankenstein's shabbily attired monster, however.  And the aliens ambulate no more agiley as their invisible limbs plow flatfooted through the dirt.

Of course, once atomic energy becomes a household word, the next thing you know, man will be on the Moon -- and the Moon Aliens plan to put the skids to THAT!

To prevent earthlings from exploring space, the ""Invisible Invaders"" (alien Moon residents) plan to attack, invade, and take over planet Earth, killing all the Earthlings in the process. Since these moon folks and their spacecraft are invisible it's clearly difficult to do battle with them. The invaders DO pre-warn Earth's residents to just give up the planet, but you know how stubborn Earthlings are. The Invisible Invaders can re-animate corpses so we end up with a sort of either ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" -type scenario as the battle for earth ensues.

As the situation deteriorates for the Earthlings a small band of Earth's scientists ultimately retreat to a secret military bunker where they attempt to devise a new weapon which will derail their alien attackers. It soon becomes apparent to these scientists that the only real weapon that the Moonsters (my word) have is invisibility itself. I'll have to stop there to avoid giving rise to a Spoiler!

The 1959 film, ""Invisible Invaders"" is shot in black-and-white and runs 67 minutes in duration. The aspect is full frame. Produced by Premium Films, the movie was directed by Edward L. Cahn and the big stars are John Carradine (superb!), John Agar, and Robert Hutton. The music was composed by Paul Dunlap (pretty good) and the special effects are by Roger George.

I'm a huge fan of this genre of period films and this one is okay - the actors played their roles quite well but both the story and the special effects are just a little too silly and absurd.

It all begins when John Carradine gets blown to bits in his lab after a failed nuclear experiment.  Nevermind he had to have been reduced to split atoms, those Invisibles someway cleverly reconstruct his body and procure him as their prophet of doom.  Tell Washington what we're up to, Carradine-ala-Invader intones, or within 24 hours we'll unleash total mayhem.  Well, Washington ignores the obvious and mayhem totally unleashes.  Earth is terrorized, or rather stock footage of earthly disasters which appears all the more alarming as they are, indeed, genuinely frightening actual disaster footage.

To the rescue come two scientists, a daughter of a scientist (Jean Byron), and Major Bruce Jay (John Agar).  They hide out in an underground bunker and fiddle with all sorts of dial-up knob-twisting technology and beakers of bubbly potions and steaming brews while peering worriedly at a closed-circuit television screen showing shots of the lurching undead gathering round their hideout preparing for attack.  Nothing avails to cease the lurching crowd, until a disaster almost strikes within the bunker itself.  I hate to spoil the ending, but an astute viewer shall catch definite shades of GHOSTBUSTERS within it.  Saved in the nick of time, and the Nations of Earth learn their lessons and vow to quit all those silly nuclear experiments lest something like this happen again.

Certainly this premise must have appeared unsettling to audiences of the era.  The atom bomb did threaten, the cold war was hot, and who knew what aliens lurked beyond suburbia?  All in all, I maintain a healthy respect for Cahn and his subject matter.  He worked the topics of the day with a sort of stylish, intelligent action-packed low-budget class.  I also hold a notable respect for the scientist's daughter ~ never once was she seen with a hair out of place or mussed makeup.

For those unfamiliar with it, INVISIBLE INVADERS was a quickly made sci-fi/horror programmer, with no real artistic aspirations behind its creation/production, just something to fill a double-bill in most theaters with another inexpensive feature; it was mostly aimed at younger audiences who, presumably, were not too discriminating in their filmgoing tastes. That said, it did have its virtues -- a good leading man in John Agar, as competent director in Edward L. Cahn, and a script that drew -- however irrationally at times -- from two touchstones of sci-fi and horror, alien invaders and zombies. Scholar/author Tom Weaver gives a bracing, riveting, and often delightfully fun (if occasionally snarky -- but who can blame him on a movie like this) commentary that is far better structured and more carefully put together than the movie itself.

Couple that with some fascinating details about the movie's release history from a second contributor, and a really sharp transfer of this picture, plus some crackerjack accompanying trailers, and you've got yourself one solid DVD release here (also available in blu-ray). I've done more than two-dozen commentaries on movies for DVD (and laserdisc) myself, and I can say that Weaver's is one of the best ever attached to a movie of this caliber (compare it to the almost insulting audio commentary on the Warner release of The Giant Behemoth). In some ways, his contribution is more fun than the movie itself. This one's a keeper, even if the movie doesn't seem like one (and it is better than I've made it sound -- for all of its flaws, it is sort of the link between PLAN 9 FROM OTHER SPACE and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, while still owing a debt to old-time movie serials in elements of its structure.

First, despite a budget that probably wouldnt cover  lunch for a modern film crew and a shooting schedule counted in days, the actors, director, and editor treat this like a big-budget film. The sincerity and conviction behind every element is top notch. Some of the dialog, mostly the narration, is corny, but it moves the already brisk story along. And the actors are professional and convincing.

Can't afford aliens? Make 'em invisible (though when they do appear, it's a cool, whitish blob); can't afford more than one radiation suit? Claim the stock pick-up truck can shield against radiation (keep those windows up). Cant afford a lot of special effects? At least make a couple of great looking sound guns. And the money we saved by not showing the aliens? Lets use it for make-up on the what was then unique: zombies (Plan 9 came out the same year, but the quality of that cherished cheese makes Invisible Invaders look like 2001).
