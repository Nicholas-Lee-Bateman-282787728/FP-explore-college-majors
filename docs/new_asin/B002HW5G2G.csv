8370537,5,B002HW5G2G,"Adrian Peterson is an awesome athlete as we all know. But what many people don't know is that actual training footage is very hard to come by and this DVD encapsulated all aspects of his ""coming off age"" in the NFL from the day he was drafted to where he broke NFL records against the Philly Eagles.
This DVD is a must for any fan of the game. Trust me, I am a Springbok rugby supporter (As I favor rugby to the NFL)but this DVD even astounded me and converted me.",1297468800,2,464,4.1098901098901095
