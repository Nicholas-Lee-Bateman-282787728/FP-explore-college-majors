8617679,5,B00FPNQHUY,"Bought this for my 1.5 year old for $5 from Walmart. Out of the collection of Pocoyo dvds, this is the best one. Instead of a bunch of episodes, it's like a hour long music video/variety show of songs all pieced together like a movie. My child enjoys it. Caught him dancing to it on different occasions.",1476489600,,303,4.333333333333333
