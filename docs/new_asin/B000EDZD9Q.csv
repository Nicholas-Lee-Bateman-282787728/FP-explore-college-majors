8108722,5,B000EDZD9Q,nice service nice price nice used...I collect laserdisc movies. because i like more laser disc than dvd or other. .,1356048000,,115,4.8
8108723,5,B000EDZD9Q,"This is the only way to see this movie in it's original form. The widescreen edition on Laserdisc is the last to exist before Lucas ripped it up and pretty much made it a joke. The original discs showed R2 getting captured in daylight, Solo shooting first and a handful of other editing mistakes. The widescreen special edition was released in '92 or '93 and for a very limited time. But is still the original version. Buy it while there are still very few copies available. The audio trumps anything on DVD and the video while a little pink at times is the best you can get. Also, the widescreen edition is the only way to get a disc with the very dynamic digital tracks. Anything earlier is analog.",1300492800,11,700,4.434108527131783
8108724,4,B000EDZD9Q,"Of note, this LaserDisc is the original release version of the story.  Not only does it show only the original special effects without the new CGI creatures and changes, but it still has Han Solo shoot FIRST when confronted by Guido in the bar scene.  George Lucas modified that scene in the newer editions.

I do like the CGI effects of newer releases, but prefer the original character development of Han Solo first presented as an imperfect scoundral.",1272240000,4,454,4.794871794871795
8108725,1,B000EDZD9Q,THIS IS the worst part of my life. I saved up all my pocket change to buy what i thought was a DVD of STAR WARS. Instead its a 20 inch wide disk. You would have a better time mashing up a vhs and putting it in a dvd player. I smashed this in my backyard when i was bored one summer day. That was the most fun i got out of this retarted piece of garbage.,1168732800,,353,3.5974025974025974
8108726,3,B000EDZD9Q,"This is not a DVD, in case anyone is confused by what a LaserDisc might be.

It is, however, one of the surest ways to have a 'digital' copy (i.e. no deterioration of the magnetic tapes in VHS etc) of the original Star Wars trilogy as they were meant to be, back in the days...

As someone who is affectionately attached the the way those films were originally done, with all their perfectly-made imperfections, this is something I hold on to dearly.... well, that is until someday if Mr. Lucas & Co. should ever decide to release a DVD or whatever future format there will be, for those origial films.

I bought this LaserDisc in the late 80's, that was the time when some of us geeks went out and bought a LaserDisc player.  In today's world, I'm not sure if anyone other than collectors would pay $100 for these things.",1147564800,6,822,4.423841059602649
