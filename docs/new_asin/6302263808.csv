447508,5,6302263808,"Whore is a must see for every girl over the age of 13. Or for anyone who thinks Pretty Woman was a good movie.

This movies needs a DVD release NOW!!!!!!!",1112745600,9,154,3.967741935483871
447509,5,6302263808,"Ms. Russell does a fantastic job in this movie. She is a beatiful street-walker, has pimp problems, acts so believable that it's hard to watch at times. What a great actress!

Oh, did I see a one-star review copied three times in order to lower the general rating of this film?

Well, just watch it and let your daughter watch it too! You may change your views on prostitution and realize that society should drop the morality issue and replace it by a human one. Perhaps then we will show some maturity to the rest of the world.",1103068800,29,529,4.387755102040816
447510,1,6302263808,"This movie frankly is awful and pointless.  It attempts to show the story of a prostitute and what her life is like but I could never tell if the movie was supposed to be a satire, if it was supposed to be comedy because it's characters were such caricatures, or if it was supposed to taken seriously.  Either way, the movie lacks anything remotely interesting.  It's neither titillating nor enlightening.  In short, it's a waste of a few hours.",1095206400,7,445,4.594936708860759
447511,3,6302263808,"The only one reason that I have seen this film is the director of this film, Ken Russell who is one of my favorite directors. However, contrary to my expectations, it gives only disappointment. As the title shows, it describes a life of one prostitute who threads streets of the city. At the beginning, this film progresses with her conversation to the audience that how she has became a prostitute and how she has lived. This kind of form makes a characteristic feeling, but as the whole, this film has lost persuasiveness. Unfortunately, I think, the director of this film, Ken Russell did not show what he really wants to talk about. This kind of film has to evoke sympathy from the audience, but it is lacking in this point. So, it was not particularly interesting and has no impression or excitement. After all, it just became a trashy work of Ken Russells films. He brought forward a problem well, but solving this problem was little bit clumsy.",1022371200,16,951,4.666666666666667
447512,3,6302263808,"Banned!
I won't pretend that this is even one of my favorite movies, but it was good.  I had to go way out of my way to see this film as it was banned where I lived and I think that was a disgrace to this country.  I wouldn't hesitate for a second to let my children watch this film, but I would take the time to explain it to them... on the other hand I'd do anything in my power to keep my kids, especially my daughter, from seeing Pretty Woman.",1008547200,13,447,3.847826086956522
447513,5,6302263808,"Being a long time Theresa Russell fan I approached this film hesitantly.  Theresa has been known to take on projects that most actresses would be too  scared to take.  This role for instant was thrown back by Oscar worthy  famous actress Michele ""Throw Me a Bone Here"" Pfifer.  Theresa  is a gambler....a rebel....a diva ala extrodinaire.  When she takes a  project she is basically marking a huge bullseye on her rear end and  sticking her target out for every critic to take his/her best shot.  With  ""Whore"" Theresa takes her character through a deep emotional  journey to the far and deep nether regions we common people know as  ""the gutter."" (a.k.a. rock bottom)  Well Theresa.....I'VE BEEN  THERE and sister you have shown everyone that a nite at the Cherry Motel is  NO LAUGHING MATTER!  What is the sum of 2+2?  Ask Theresa.  Her  monologues are sheer genius.  The look of the film is extremely stylized.  Many people don't know this but a young Kevin Aucoin did the make-up on all  of the whores.  (did he also do the bullseye on theresa's bum?  har  har)
PLEASE.....If you have a young daughter she needs to see this film.  It will teach her that being a street walker just ""ain't no fun.""  I recently heard Dr. Laura touting this film for educational purposes in  Jr. High Schools because of it's strong moral content.
Whether it's  Double Entry or Half and Half you can always rely on Miss Russell to  deliver a virtuosity of performances.  PLEASE KEN PLEASE...WE are BEGGING  for director and STAR commentary on the DVD release!  Ladies and",952646400,22,1554,4.696629213483146
447514,5,6302263808,"Overall excellent in its approach on Ms. Russel's character. Sort of a ""female version of Taxi Driver"". Her life rips from the seams right before us. Makes a great double feature with Ken Russell's  ""Crimes of Passion"" (1984).",950400000,11,226,4.947368421052632
447515,5,6302263808,This movie is a cultural phenomonon.  A feast of the senses.  Powerful performance by theresa russel.  She played a wonderful whore.  Convincing.  Breathtaking imagery.  This movie deserves six stars!!!,925689600,12,202,5.793103448275862
447576,2,6302263808,"The stars are for the DVD, not the film. Although a LionsGate film, it is not available on an official US DVD (as of 4/2015), but is available on an Italian import, for those with universal systems.  The disk is full-frame, which is the aspect ratio I have always seen in this movie, and the running time is the 84 min listed in most movie guides. The disk has Italian subtitles which can be turned off but ONLY from the main menu - not from a subtitle button on your remote. The sound is very muted, and the color is washed out, compared to the version shown on US cable/sat channels. The bit rate is about 1.0 Mb/s higher than a self-burned DVD-R, probably because it is in the PAL format. The print I saw on TV had both pillarboxing and letterboxing, probably because it was never upgraded for the HD channel that showed it, which makes the full-size Italian version somewhat more satisfying, though not much better in terms of image quality. All things considered, I would try to wait out LionsGate and hope for a decent US release - the import is not really worth the money unless you are desperate to have a copy of the film. In any case, for a Ken Russell movie, it is surprisingly cheap-looking, and not simply in service of the material - it looks like it was made on a shoestring.",1427673600,5,1290,4.375

447579,4,6302263808,I really enjoyed this movie when it first came out. I decided to add it to my collection of oldies but goodies. Teresa played her role in this movie to the tee.  I enjoy watching her in movies and respect her as a good actress.,1369353600,,227,4.044444444444444
447580,5,6302263808,"Why don't great movies like WHORE make it to DVD?  If you liked THE RAZOR'S EDGE with Bill Murray and Theresa Russell, then you'll like WHORE.  Other great movies that never made it to DVD include the Brazilian movie with Sonia Braga, I LOVE YOU, and THE IN-CROWD with Jennifer Runyon.  I'm just thankful that A NEW LEAF finally made it to DVD.",1362355200,6,344,4.428571428571429
447581,3,6302263808,"Director Ken Russell has never been accused of understatement, and this in-your-face character study of a jaded streetwalker is no exception. Theresa Russell chews major scenery in the lead role. The film has been misunderstood by viewers who miss the black comic undertones (I find it interesting that in 2006, no one blinks at Amy Sedaris' broad portrayal of a 42 year-old ex-hooker going back to high school on Comedy Central's ""Strangers With Candy"", but we still have reviewers tsk-tsking over Russell's 1991 treatment of the subject!) There are pacing issues that betray the story's stage play origins. Russell's character addresses the audience throughout, making the story a bit ""talky"" at times. In fact, characters in the film spend much more time TALKING about sex than actually engaging in it! Definitely a cult item. Currently not available on DVD, but used VHS copies can tracked down. Beware of the butchered ""R"" rated prints; the uncut ""European"" version contains 7 extra minutes (the excised scenes are actually tame by current standards). A note to my fellow reviewer regarding Ms. Russell's marital status: She is NOT married to Ken Russell, but to director Nicholas Roeg.",1152576000,17,1191,5.176165803108808
447582,1,6302263808,"This film is self-defeated by two opposing currents: it's much too silly and poorly acted to be taken seriously, much too sad and brutal to be considered good campy fun. I don't know what effect the makers were shooting for, but suffice to say that their aim was off by miles.",1145318400,6,276,4.431372549019608
447583,5,6302263808,"I think all of you are missing the point here. This film is first and foremost funny! It comes off all serious and trying to be ""hip"" (for 91' that is). I think my favorite part is when she gets stopped by two bike police and she makes fun of them saying, ""What do you want me to do? Run alongside your bike? Or were you just going to cuff me to your spoke?"" Defiantely makes me want to see ""Whore 2""!",1133395200,8,401,3.902439024390244
447584,5,6302263808,"Theresa Russell gives on of her best performances in this film.  This film is gritty and much more realistic than other films dealing with prostitution.  This is not the usual Hollywood ""hooker with a heart of gold"" type of film.  It shows what a depressing and degrading life prostitutes lead.",1133395200,15,294,4.84
447585,5,6302263808,"This is based on a British stage play and has been adapted to an American setting. The critics hated this flick but I thought it was great. It's not for everyone but I found it to be good character study with humor, sex, and all the other elements of the fun sleaze that make Ken Russell film so much raunchy fun. I like the character of Rasta and I haven't liked Ms. Russell in another movie before or since. Porn star Ginger Lynn Allen does a cameo as does cult actor Jack Nance. Go see ""Whore"" even if you can't say it.",1133395200,5,522,4.127450980392157

7823458,4,6302263808,"I don't quite get the prudery in not releasing this great film for U.S. viewers, unless it is that Ken Russell cuts too close to the bones of wholesome family values. You have Russell's deliberate theatricalization, that affords us a proper space to engage with one of his flammable subjects and his usual sacred terror of colors, as well as conducts the depiction of prostitution to strictly play out AS show--the display windows of the modern patriarchal imagination. Comparing some frame stills, I'm wary of this disc's fullframe presentation: the left and right parts of the frame look like they are cut off. We can certainly get better image definition, too. Criterion, somebody, please come to the rescue.",1509148800,2,711,5.033898305084746
