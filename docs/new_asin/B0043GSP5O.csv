8414941,5,B0043GSP5O,"When Lions Of Darkness first comes on, it is obvious that the definition is low. There are two movies on this DVD Disc: Lions Of Darkness, and Walking With Lions. I viewed both movies and I thought that Walking With Lions, was just as interesting. It was a little more clearer, and the definition was a little higher than Lions of Darkness. That was surprising considering its on the same disc but done by different producers. When I bought this documentary, I expected a higher definition than VHS.

Lions Of Darkness is a very good documentary, and it would be nice if Nat Geo, upgraded it to Blu-ray. It is one of the more detailed stories of Lion survival in the African jungle by a pride of lions. The story line is very interesting, and entertaining. This movie has been out for awhile, but is more detailed than the current movies made today on the subject of lions.

It's good enough for Nat Geo, to seriously consider, upgrading this unto Blue-ray. This movie shows lion take-over of other prides, young male lions being driven out of the pride because they are now old enough to take care of themselves and pose a threat, and a future challenge, to the male lions already in control of the pride. I enjoyed the story of Tao, the youngest lion in the pride, 6 months younger than the rest, and the last to be ousted from the pride, after he was old enough to fend for himself. This movie is on DVD, and looks acceptable during an up-scaling from a blue-ray player. But would look even better in 1080p.",1363824000,2,1510,4.487272727272727
