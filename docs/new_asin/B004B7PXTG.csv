Time to toss these old discs and remaster this wonderful program.  And if you do that, could we maybe lose the commercials?  The disc's root menu has a selection for Special Features, but when you go there, ""Return to Main Menu"" is the only option.  What gives there?",1487980800,,424,4.384615384615385
