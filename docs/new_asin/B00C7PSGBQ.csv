5696463,5,B00C7PSGBQ,"Really happy to finally own the complete boxset of this brilliant tv show.

I just love American comedy shows. This show has excellent jokes and makes me laugh. I haven't seen the complete series yet. So therefore can't comment on how the show progresses. I can't wait to see Wil Wheaton because I just adore the actor.

You may want to buy the Blu-Ray version of this box set if you care for perfect picture quality. In this DVD version, the picture quality is not hot and may be a problem for all you Full HD fans. It's not a problem for me as long as I can see the show and hear it.

Can't wait to watch these episodes from scratch.",1442102400,5,635,4.188524590163935

5696494,1,B00C7PSGBQ,Don't BUY THIS!!  It is blu ray and thought I would be getting high quality but I was wrong.  This is VERY grainy and not clear at all.

5696499,4,B00C7PSGBQ,Great Show and Blu-Rays are very good. Some small qwerks but nothing you can't live with. The cases the disks are held in are another matter. Many of the tabs that hold the disks were broken upon arrival. Many other tabs broke during use. Now disks are only held in by one or two remaining tabs and they are so loose they can easily fall out.,1474588800,,342,4.196969696969697
5696500,5,B00C7PSGBQ,We love this show so it was nice to be able to purchase the first eight seasons at a great price.

5696506,4,B00C7PSGBQ,Even though I love the TV series  I give it 4 stars cause its not fair putting it only on blue ray. Not everyone  has or wants blue ray. I wish the DVD company stop trying to shove blue ray down our throats nobody's going to sit back and rebut all their movies cause blue ray CLAIMS THEY'RE SO MUCH BETTER CAUSE THEORY NOT. I Have Watch Regular DVD Movies and  TV Series  On Both Blue Ray and  Regular  On All kinds  Of Flat Screens TVs. Even the new curved TV which  is so much better they claim than regular  flat screens. They not only cost more some for blue ray they not better than regular DVD they just cost more. And as soon as you rebuy  your movies or TV shows  on blue ray out comes something else which will claim better than blue ray.,1473552000,,747,4.0479452054794525

5696509,3,B00C7PSGBQ,"While you do get the entire series of the Big Bang Theory up to and including season 8, you do not get the same quality as the US made counterparts. I found the episodes to be very hazy and grainy so to speak and almost looked as if they were just unconverted DVD's. You still cannot beat the price even used will run you around $50 more comparatively.",1473120000,3,352,4.1911764705882355

5696511,3,B00C7PSGBQ,"This is a very nice set. It comes in a nice box. Each season is split up on two disks. My only complaint is the audio is out of sync just a hair. The audio is behind the video by a few milliseconds. It's close enough that most people probably won't notice, but that kinda stuff sticks out to me. It's not unwatchable, just kinda irritating. That's why I am only giving three stars. On a side not I wished it gave a description of the episode when you pick it in the menu. The names of the episodes are very random and it makes it difficult to find where you left off. Overall still a pretty good buy at a very good p",1472947200,2,616,3.975806451612903

5696516,5,B00C7PSGBQ,"I absolutely love this series.  I watch it with my man who is actually the one who introduced me to my first episode.  I love these characters.  I never get tired of their antics.  I was worried about it saying UK but I have a US dvd blu-ray player and have enjoyed every cd without any trouble.  I've watched all of them and can hardly wait for season 9 & 10.  Can't wait for more.  I'll be sad when the series is over.  Might pull a Sheldon Firefly move!!  Nothing feels forced.

5696518,5,B00C7PSGBQ,"One of my all time favorite television programs! My husband purchased this for me for Mother's Day and I almost teared up. I had been really wanting to watch this show, but the usual streaming services don't carry it. When you have an itch, it doesn't go away until it's scratched. Think of this boxed set as a nice set of strong fingernails. My itch was scratched! I've laughed myself into the wee hours of the night with little to no regrets. The show's theme song plays often in the back of my mind. Now, I don't need to worry about not being able to watch it, because I OWN IT!!!!!",1471996800,,585,4.2792792792792795

Continuous laughter and giggling all night long. I sometimes have to crack the door and peek in to see just whats going on in there sometime. The packaging was very exceptional and shipping as always was a breaze with my amazon prime membership. All 8 seasons in one convienient package was great and you just couldn't beat the price, you do the math compaired to buying each season seperatly. Absolutly a exceptional product and service from amazon as always.",1470873600,,591,4.6380952380952385
5696528,3,B00C7PSGBQ,"I really wanted this and when I found it for under forty bucks with a lot of good reviews I jumped for it.  Now the problems, the first episode is so grainy it's almost unwatchable but it seems to clear up after that.  Why a bad first episode?  Then their select episode menu is a joke, it's like no one tests stuff nowadays and they just put out crap.  The problem is you can barely tell when something is selected it's white or light gray for the difference and now the big problem is that's to get into episodes and once you get to episodes you can't tell at all if one is selected or not so it's a useless function altogether.  Expect to be doing a lot of fast forward or rewinding to get to episodes you want.  Really bad selection set up, test your products companies and use at least one brain cell if they suck to change it to a workable  product.",1470614400,2,855,4.1454545454545455

5696538,5,B00C7PSGBQ,"By my rubric the show is a 5.  Even though I could see it for free in any number of syndicated slots on cable  I bought the disks anyway.  And being a bit hearing impaired, I appreciate the subtitles.
A minor quibble  but something that comes up every time I use the disks:  The menu buttons have a similar color (dark gray, dark blue), so you have to be a real eagle eye to differentiate between the two and see what you are actually selecting.  Minor, but annoying.

Addendum:  It will take some time to get through 8 years worth of episodes  but I did binge-watch the extras and am glad to see that after season one, the menus are just fine.",1469145600,,644,4.213114754098361

I have already tested out the DVDs and not only do they work perfectly on my DVD player, they are amazing quality. I will agree with something that I read in another review - if you're a ""collector,"" it might not be exactly what you're expecting in terms of the packaging. Seasons 1-3 are together in one case, seasons 4-6 are in another, and then seasons 7 and 8 are in their own, separate cases. With that said, all of the seasons still include all special features, etc., and you WILL NOT find this many seasons for this low of a price anywhere else (not even close), so who cares how they're bundled up?! This price is beyond incredible for 8 full seasons in amazing, blu-ray quality. I would advise anyone who is a fan of the show to purchase this set. I seriously could not be more excited and pleased with this purchase! :)",1468540800,,930,4.381502890173411

As for the discs themselves and the U.K. thing, well, I live in West Chester PA, have a Samsung Blu-Ray player from 2010ish and these discs play fine.  One thing I noticed is that it may have taken a little longer than usual for them to start so be patient. When I put in the first disc, little discs began to revolve on the center of the screen, then the screen went black, then there was a message about piracy, after that a message that says if you have problems playing the discs, you may need to update the firmware on your Blu-Ray player and then the menu screen with the characters came up, pressed play and was good to go.

5696608,5,B00C7PSGBQ,"Upon purchasing this box- set of The Big Bang Theory I was very worried about being ""attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis"". I had this worry because of the discs being imported from the United Kingdom. The Blu-ray discs in the U.K. sometimes only work on region B Blu-ray players while in the United States of America region A players are the only ones that are easily available. Thankfully the discs in this set are region free and do work on any Blu-ray players. I have been a fan of The Big Bang Theory for quite a while and have been renting the show from a local video store. The money spent on renting each series does add up and if one is to purchase all that is in this set on iTunes it costs hundreds of dollars. This set of Blu-ray Discs is a much better deal. This set also costs less than the set that only includes series 1 through 7. I only have a small amount of complaints about this set. This set includes four Blu-ray Disc cases instead of the expected 1 or 8. The first box contains the first three series and the second box houses the 4th, 5th, and 6th series. Series 7 and 8 each have their own cases. I do not quite understand this layout but it is not a very large issue at all. The only other problem is the video quality on the first few episodes. The image is a bit grainy but not a problem with a small television. The other episodes are fine. Overall this set is a wonderful collection of one of the best American sitcoms and definitely worth every penny.",1460160000,11,1527,4.25085910652921

5696614,5,B00C7PSGBQ,"Our PS4 is out of commission currently, but I wanted to advise other shoppers that this set DID work in our PS3.

This set is very generic, not flashy. If you are looking for a quality display case with 8 separate cases for each of the seasons, this is not the set for you, dear collector. This is strictly a bargain set! So, seasons 1-3 are in one Blu-ray case, seasons 4-6 are in another Blu-ray case, seasons 7 & 8 each have their own Blu-ray case. The set looks kind of thrown together (3 cases have the same look, while the 4th has a different picture). This made no difference to me, as I only cared about watching the show, and the deal I was getting on Amazon. I will post pictures within a few days if I can.

My fiance and I love this show, so this was an excellent deal! The Big Bang has become our comfort show, much like Friends was for many, years ago.",1459468800,32,866,4.118343195266272

5696639,2,B00C7PSGBQ,"This is only a review of this box set. I love The Big Bang Theory. I thought this seemed like an excellent deal. The first disc I played, Season 1, was grainy looking. Blu-rays are suppose to be of better quality than dvds. If this had been a dvd I still would've been disappointed. I watched a few of the other discs to see if they were of the same poor quality. They were better, but not any better quality than of a dvd. After turning on the blu-ray player, and returning to watch the very same disc, it would not ask if I wanted to resume from where I had left off watching. The other discs did have this feature, even after watching a different blu-ray in between . The disc menus were a strange set up. I will now buy the individual seasons.",1455667200,5,747,4.158620689655172
5696640,5,B00C7PSGBQ,"I got this for my husband for Valentine's Day. He kept commenting on the fact that he's missed so many episodes of the show, so I decided to buy him the whole set. He was so excited to receive this and he said it's the best gift that I could have gotten him- that's how bad he wanted to catch up on the show. We put it in our Xbox One and it plays perfectly fine. Not only does it have a great picture quality, but it saved me a bunch of money by buying this version. I am super happy and I highly recommend.",1455408000,17,508,3.8476190476190477

5696659,4,B00C7PSGBQ,"Big fan of Big Bang Theory. I took a risk and bought a region-free box set because this is not available in the US. At first it wouldn't work, but my husband tinkered with our blu-ray player's settings and I was able to watch it. Hours and hours of enjoyment! Of course it doesn't hurt that I absolutely love the show. Just take note and do the research beforehand, so you're sure that this will work with your blu-ray player in the US. If it doesn't work you might need to buy the US version ones separately (if you're determined to own all seasons of the show). I took out one star because of that, but it's otherwise awesome!",1453248000,2,628,4.285714285714286
