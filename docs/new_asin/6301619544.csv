339911,5,6301619544,"I do not care what any says or thinks. Zapped Again! is the best teen movie of the 90's! Along w/ Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Mallrats, & Clueless. Those all the better than She's All That & all those other BS teen movies made five years ago. Anyways, I loved the whole & especially when Todd Eric Andrews followed Scott Baio's path. There is also an awesome music video at the end as well. If you grew up in this era like me or just love awesome movies. Than this is the best teen movie to see w/ your friends. Its totally 90s!!!!!!!!!!",1061942400,5,573,4.26605504587156
339912,1,6301619544,"This movie made the first one seemed a campy classic. Well, the first one deserved to be a campy classic. ""Zapped Again"" the sequel is none of the above.
Took place perhaps several years after the first one,  Todd Eric Andrews played another nerd who discovered Scott Baio's stash of telekinetic prune juice in  a secret compartment in the wall of his former lab. Meanwhile he is trying to start a science club while being harrassed by the jocks.
With a cameo appearance by Linda Blair, the classic clothes ripping finale of the first movie was mentioned in passing. So does this movie ended with a high note as the first?
No, not exactly. But let's say that in this movie, high school girls started wearing bras for a change and that guys can't no longer stuff their supposedly LONG tuxedo shirts into their skimpy underwear. Which means....the ending is a yawner.
And so is this movie. It fail to live up to the first one.....which shouldn't be too difficult to begin with.",997401600,11,975,4.630057803468208

339974,1,6301619544,"If you liked the original ""Zapped"" and are wanting to see this one because you think it will be just as good, don't do it. It's just really not a good movie at all. This movie was made in 1990 which was several years after the original. There is stuff briefly mentioned from the original film, but that's about it. The original had me laughing quite a few times. This one will not do that. You will either be yawning or crying, and definitely bored. It beats me why this movie is selling for so much. I got this movie new a few years ago cheap, watched it once, and then threw it on ebay right after I saw it. I can't complain because I actually made more money than what I paid for it. I can only recommend this movie for a rental, and that's only if you are curious to see how bad it is. Don't pay an arm and a leg for this stinker. It's so not worth it, unless you find it at a flea market, thrift store, or garage sale cheap. Not worth more than 3 dollars in my opinion. 1 out of 5 stars",1383350400,,991,3.96
339975,5,6301619544,glad to find it. been looking for it  for many years at  all stores and never had any luck thanks,1381104000,,97,3.8
339976,5,6301619544,This movie is great. Great plot. Great early 90sand comedy. I love early 90s movies amd this one delivers! Plus its BETTER then the 1st one. Yes part one is good...but 2 is better! And the girl who co-stars in it is hot! Dont knk wat it is about her but wow shes a hotty! Think ifs her sweet character.  Anyway don't listen to anyonr who hates this. Take my advice amd buy it(if u can find it) o and its kinda cheesy. But thats another reason why its great:),1369958400,3,458,4.088888888888889
339977,5,6301619544,Like the original zapped this one is a fun and funny high school movie. I remember watching this as a kid and wow talk about memories. It's no cloud atlas but its entertaining and has a high rewatch value.  Highly recommended !!,1369440000,,228,4.428571428571429
339978,5,6301619544,This movie continues the wacky antics started in the original with a new cast of misfits lead by a new kid who seems to rub everybody the wrong way but the science club.,1365292800,,169,4.151515151515151
339979,1,6301619544,That about sums it up.  The most interesting thing about this film is the uncanny similarity between the voice and delivery of star Todd Eric Andrews and David Spade.  But we already have one and we don't need another.,1212883200,,218,4.564102564102564
339980,3,6301619544,"Granted, its not as classically fun as the originally, but it still is worth having in your collection. The random stars in this movie make it worth it also. Linda Blair is HOT in this movie, and Lyle Alzado makes for an extra side to this sequel.

339981,4,6301619544,"This film is extremely goofy and isn't for anyone who wants a sophisticated film like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" or even ""Bambi"" for that matter!  I've never seen the original Zapped, nor do I want to, but the music for this movie is AMAZING!!; it's so nostalgically 80's and there's one song on here called ""If I Didn't Love You"" by Esther Terry that for a long time I was really wishing was available on CD somewhere!!!  now I know I'd probably sell it a month later if I did have it on CD, but anyway; the main character who gets ""Zapped"" (???) has a charming sense of sarcasm running on and off throughout the film and Linda Blair makes a special ""dress apperance"" (find out what I mean by watching the film!), plus the music and look of the film is so highly reminiscent of the late 80's!!!  It reminds me of those old days when I used to see the very beginning of ""Step By Step"" and shows like that (???) and then, I guess, my mother either turned the TV off or I had to go to school or something like that...but anyway; if you can make room in your DVD collection for little films like this and you went to high school in the 80's or **wish** you did, then this film **MIGHT** be for you!",1105056000,3,1195,4.209606986899563
