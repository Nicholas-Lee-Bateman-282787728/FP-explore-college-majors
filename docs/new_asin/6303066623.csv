545166,4,6303066623,"One of the more obscure of Anthony Mann's Westerns, The Last Frontier was also his only cavalry Western (aside from one brief episode in Winchester `73), though naturally he focuses on the outsiders and internal conflicts rather than offering a Fordian celebration of comradeship and shared ideals. Set not in his beloved high country but in the foothills and forests, it's a much more cynical view of life of the frontier, in many ways his Fort Apache without the need to preserve the legend: this outpost is made up of misfits, failures, cowards and the odd competent officer ignored by his superiors, badly led while the Civil War takes priority and all the best the army has to offer.

Victor Mature and James Whitmore are the free trappers who find civilization creeping up on them when they are relieved of their pelts and packhorses by a local tribe aggrieved by the incursion of the Cavalry into their territory. Rather than blame the Indians for their losses they decide it's the army's fault for building the fort and decide to demand compensation from them, ending up joining their ranks as scouts instead. But despite the best efforts of Guy Madison's amiable and competent acting commander to bring Mature into the 19th Century and make him fit to wear the uniform, the arrival of Robert Preston's humiliated Colonel eager to revenge himself on the tribe that drove him out of his own outpost - and Mature's clumsy infatuation with the Colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft, too much of a blank slate here to do much with the role of a woman who's tired of being saved by men who think they know what's best for her) - soon drive matters into much darker territory. It's not long before some of the soldiers are busily planning on killing each other, both sides trying to goad their subordinates into doing the deed for them: little wonder that at one point Mature throws away the bluecoat he has long coveted in disgust, screaming ""I would have died for this, but it's nothing but a dirty filthy blue rag!""

The Stallone of his day, Mature was one of those actors who could surprise you with the odd excellent performance here and there when matched with the right part and the right director. This is not one of his better days despite having his most complex part, perversely enough as a simple man - well-meaning but drunk, violent, uneducated and with a unsubtle, almost childlike lust for life, the part seems designed with Burt Lancaster in mind, with some striking similarities to his character in The Kentuckian. But Robert Preston's Ahab-like Colonel is clearly the best role, determined to resurrect the career he destroyed in a single disastrously suicidal Civil War engagement by launching another pointless suicidal campaign against the tribe that added another humiliation to the list that keeps him out of sight and out of mind of the promotion board. In his obsession to redeem his career he moves further away from any hope of moral redemption, driven as much by his sense of shame at his wife's sympathy as by the promotion of former comrades he regards as his inferiors. He's beyond salvation, but there's still a recognisable human being in there and one not entirely without a sense of integrity - he genuinely admires Madison's courage in making a futile attempt to get Preston's orders countermanded by their superiors - fatally skewed though it is.

Like its hero, the film is a little rough around the edges (and boasts one of the most surreal and jaunty title songs of any Western), but that only tends to make it more interesting, and there are plenty of Mann's typically elegant camera moves and plays on perspective, while the frontier setting is convincingly harsh and primitive. Unfortunately the deficiencies of the early CinemaScope lenses are very apparent in Columbia's DVD, with the image often dark (2.55:1 CinemaScope required a huge amount of additional lighting and early Scope films show a lot of trial-and-error) and grainy.",1194912000,6,3972,4.855457227138643
545167,5,6303066623,"I enjoyed this film, which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex love-hate relationships, along with interspersed action scenes and some lighthearted moments in which the mountain men counter harsh army discipline. All of the main characters are well cast. True, John Wayne or Robert Mitchum probably could have done as well in the starring role, but Victor Mature certainly comes across as a head-strong brawling tarzan of sorts. Reminds me of his film role as Samson, another difficult, but not impossible, man to tame.
  The 3 mountain men in the opening scene  are certainly an anachronism, as the era of mountain men pure trappers pretty much ended 20 years before this story takes place, with the collapse of western beaver populations as well as of the beaver fashion market.  This story supposedly takes place in Oregon, just before the end of the Civil War. Judging by the volcano in the background of the opening scene(probably Mt. Lassen , in California), the fort is in a  very remote area of the Cascades, as we never see any other civilians.  However, there is plenty of conflicting evidence that it actually takes place in the mountains of Wyoming or Montana! Red Cloud, the war chief  who threatens both the trappers and the army fort, is the namesake of a very famous Sioux war chief, who led a very successful campaign in 1865-6 to exterminate  recent army outposts in Wyoming and Montana. Fort Laramie(eastern Wyoming) is mentioned as  being not too far removed from the fictional fort. The plains tribe of Assiniboines is mentioned as joining Red Cloud. This aspect of the stroy, then, bears a general resemblance to historical fact.
  It may be of interest to note cetain resemblances between the plot of this story and that of John Ford's ""Ft. Apache"". In both cases, we have a fort commander assigned to his first frontier post with Native American  problems in the area, who underestimates the miliary prowess of his adversaries, regarding them as little more than cannon fodder to promote his career. In both films, he pays dearly for his inexperience in dealing with the enemy. Also in common, the greenhorn commander resents a subordinate who has long experience dealing with the local Native Americans, and who wants to tell him what is wise or unwise to do. In both films, we have a budding romance between a woman very close to the commander's heart and a subordinate, which the commander does everyhing to squelch. Clearly, the commander must be eliminated to allow these romances to proceed to completion.
  I also see certain resemblances with ""The Misfits"". The soldiers, as a whole, including the commander, are misfits of a sort(as one admits) in that they are mostly raw recruits from the East who know nothing about fighting Native Americans. The commander's wife, as apparently the only woman in or anywhere near the fort, is also a misfit, whose husband is very unsure of his future in the army. The 3 independent trappers, in turn, are misfits, not really wishing to adapt to army or civilian discipline, yet their previous independent lives extinguished by Red Cloud's  recent antagonism.
  Finally, I see certain resemblances with Anthony Mann's later western: ""The Far Country"", starring Jimmy Stewart. Again, we have a loner in a wild frontier area who finds it very difficult to settle down into a convensional role. In Stewart's case, he doesn't really have to make that choice.  He can go back to being a loner cowboy, minus his sidekick. But in the present film, Mature's character doesn't come up with an alternative practical way of being his own boss. He's lost his two trapper buddies and Red Cloud has made life in this area outside the army too dangerous to contemplate(This was certainly the case with the real Red Cloud). Besides, he very much wants the commander's wife.",1188086400,4,3843,4.913446676970634
545168,4,6303066623,"Victor Mature worked well in the Western genre, such as his performance as Doc Holliday in My Darling Clementine. The Last Frontier is another good performance by Mature, bolstered by strong support from Robert Preston, James Whitmore, and Guy Madison.

Mature plays a trapper/scout who is thinking of settling down in civilization. While he and his two trapper friends visit a fort in the wilderness, Mature falls for the young wife of an Army colonel who is anxious to address the danger coming from warring Indians in the area of the fort. Mature makes a play for the wife, sending Mature, the colonel and the whole fort to the brink of disaster.

The perfomances here are good, to a large extent due to the talents involved, plus the stout direction of Anthony Mann, who proved that he could take a seemingly mild-mannered actor like James Stewart and turn him into a rousing man of action. The Last Frontier is a good addition to anyone's Western DVD collection.",1121904000,18,967,4.7844311377245505
545169,5,6303066623,"THE LAST FRONTIER--also known as SAVAGE WILDERNESS--is one of the 3 best westerns ever made!!!  #1 is SHANE, #2 is THE UNFORGIVEN, and #3 is THE LAST FRONTIER!!!
  Victor Mature shines in his leading role as Jed Cooper, a rough, tough frontiersman who finds his whole world changing around him as he meets the Union officers of a fort in frontier territory, Colonel Marston (Robert Preston) and Captain Riordan
(Guy Madison).  This is an adult western, with well developed characters that help the movie to avoid the usual good guys in white hats, bad guys in black hats storyline of most westerns,  as the hard drinking and hard living Mature struggles to understand civilization.  The title song is great, the photography is great, and so is the directing and acting.
  Guy Madison--a former radio announcer--uses his voice extremely well to control his scenes, and Robert Preston is excellent as the obsessed military man.  And Anne Bancroft is superb as Preston's military wife, as she is literally swept off her feet by the bold Mature.
  Guy Williams--later of ""Zorro,"" and ""Lost in Space"" has one of his many 1950s bit parts in movies with major stars, constantly in the background--but never seen in closeups--as Private Benton.
  THE LAST FRONTIER is different from other westerns in almost every way, from its treatment of Indians to its portrayal of the military, to its development of the romance between an uncivlized frontiersman and a civilized married woman.  SHANE had the romance with a married woman--suggested--but no Indians, and THE UNFORGIVEN had neither.
  THE LAST FRONTIER IS ONE OF THE 3 BEST WESTERNS EVER MADE!!!

545170,3,6303066623,"""The Savage Wilderness"" tries very hard to achieve a realistic atmosphere but misses the mark under the weight of its Hollywood contrivances.  Still, the movie is a very notable attempt at an adult treatment of the genre, and the plot and presentation are intense enough to hook the viewer from the start.  Robert Preston plays the most interesting character, a commanding officer determined to go into battle at any cost to his personnel or his marriage, but Victor Mature gives the best performance as a standard semi-savage/semi-civilized trapper-hero.  Guy Madison plays the commanding officer who must defer to Preston, and another ""Guy""--Guy Williams of ""Zorro"" and ""Lost In Space""--has a minor role as Madison's underling.  Handsomely produced and laced with well-directed action scenes.",979948800,17,794,5.430894308943089

545283,2,6303066623,"I caught this film recently on TCM. Didn't remember seeing it back then [1955] and I really enjoy Westerns so I recorded it. Well, it's amazing what once passed for movie entertainment then.
  The story seems like it was inspired by the real life Fetterman Massacre that occurred in Montana in 1866. The Amazon editorial review states 'The story line reflects the changes that were beginning to work their way into the Western genre by the 1950s....it's still a fine example of the state of the Western in 1956.'
  Well maybe so but the implausible story line is a mess and the dialogue sounds like it was slapped together in a few minutes.
  Robert Preston gives the best performance here as the psychotic commanding officer. Looks like he had fun with this. His character steals all his scenes with an understated sense of menace.  Victor Mature bullies his way through a thoroughly stupid role as a drunken but of course honest and good hearted frontier guide, who falls for Preston's wife, a very young and very confused Anne Bancroft. Poor Ann, she has to chose between the psycho and the drunk with only cliche filled dialogue to express herself.  Guy Madison plays an absolutely do nothing Captain and James Whitmore furnishes the remaining cliches as Mature's mentor/buddy guide. The army's Indian fighting tactics depicted here are primitive, shades of Monty Python's Holy Grail, it's either 'Charge' or 'Run away'.

545290,5,6303066623,"No matter how many times I've watched this movie on the old Saturday Night At The Movies or recently on Encore Westerns, never get tired of watching The Last Frontier (earlier title: Savage Wilderness). I prefer The Last Frontier title, just something about 'savage wilderness' doesn't sound quite right.  And the soundtrack from the movie, with Rusty Draper's voice, is quite catchy.  All you buckaroos from the 1950s will remember Draper and his hit parade ""Freight Train"" song.

I am a Victor Mature fan having all his western films on file.  Victor may have said he was no actor having 20-some films to back that up, however I don't think he really believed that anymore than I do, and he gives a very smooth performance in this film. Backed up by several other accomplished actors he is the equal of any.  I'm no film research expert only watching those I like, but possibly this was one of Anne Bancroft's first films, and her more than adequate performance leaves a good memory with this viewer. Though her 'blonde' hair is a bit of over-the-top stunning for the western frontier.

Some things in this movie are a bit awry, especially the several drunken scenes, but overall this is a very good example of a Hollywood western script at its 1950s best.  The backdrop scenery for the movie truly compliments the story and the ruggedness and realism of Fort Shallet each in its own enhance this story of blue-leg infantry Army against Red Cloud's Sioux (today called Lakota). The talk of the Assiniboine joining the Sioux is not true to history as the Assiniboine tribe after 1832 was pretty much non-existent, the tribe had been scourged by the small pox epidemic that raged on the plains in those earlier days, having deadly effect on other tribes such as the Atsina, and Mandan tribes as well.

But western fans of both novels and movies this is truly a memorable film that can be watched over and over again. It's great to have it out on DVD, now if Warner Bros. will ever wake up and release Yellowstone Kelly with Clint Walker on DVD another fine color picture of the late 1950s will make western movie fans happy too.

7835944,5,6303066623,"RELEASED IN 1955 and directed by Anthony Mann, The Last Frontier (aka Savage Wilderness) stars Victor Mature as an uncivilized mountain man in 1864 who, along with his two trapper buddies (James Whitmore & Pat Hogan), seeks succor at a wilderness fort on (or near) the Bozeman Trail in the Northwest manned by a young captain (Guy Madison) and a brigade of inexperienced recruits. Jed Cooper (Mature) cant help but be attracted to a beautiful, but distant woman at the fort (Anne Bancroft), whos waiting for her gun-ho husband, a dishonored colonel, to return from another remote fort (Robert Preston). Meanwhile, Red Cloud & his braves threaten Federal advances in the region. Peter Whitney plays a grim, hulking sergeant and Russell Collins a reasonable doctor at the fort.

If you can get past the hopelessly hokey opening & closing song, this is a surprisingly great, original Western and one of Anthony Manns best. The main role was originally intended for Brando, who certainly wouldve been interesting, but Mature performs with his renowned beaming gusto.

While it might not seem like it on paper, the setting and plot are original for a Western and, believe it or not, this is easily the best fort & cavalry Western Ive ever seen. No kidding. The characters aren't one-dimensional and are therefore interesting.

Take, for instance, Prestons Colonel Marston: Hes sort of made out to be the antagonist, but you cant help respect his decisiveness, courage and honorability. A lesser man, for example, wouldve hated the young Captain (Madison) for defying him whereas the Colonel actually respects him for his bold actions and even commends him (!). He understandably seeks redemption for his gallant failure at Shiloh, which unnecessarily cost the lives of a thousand men. This would be fine if it were only HIS life on the line rather than an entire brigade of raw recruits.

The love affair subplot is handled well and the action-packed climax is unpredictable, although one-element (the final one) is eye-rolling and tacked-on by the studio (NOT approved by Mann). Nevertheless, The Last Frontier was a huge hit at the box off. Its akin to a mid-50s version of the remarkable The Last of the Mohicans (1992), albeit taking place a hundred years later in the remote northwest.

THE MOVIE RUNS 98 minutes and was shot in Popocatpetl Volcano, Puebla, Mexico (SE of Mexico City), which is an acceptable substitute for the Oregon/Wyoming/Montana region. WRITERS: Philyp Yordan & Russell S. Hughes based on Richard Emery Roberts novel The Gilded Rooster.

7835945,4,6303066623,"Although I am a fan of Victor Mature and like his movies, I was not very pleased with his acting in this film. I think he over-acted. He played an uneducated frontier man who felt he had a right to take what he wanted, even another man's wife, especially if she liked him (for anyone was better than her husband). Against the advice of the uneducated man who raised him, he wanted to go and work in the army fort because he wanted to wear the army uniform. He even took an army jacket from an Indian he killed, and wore it against army regulations. He was very good as a scout for the army, and he was very good at killing Indians. But generally he acted in a childish manner, less than immature.
He was up against the fort's colonel, a man who made a fatal mistake during the battle at Shiloh during the Civil war, resulting in over a thousand deaths. His dumb idea was that a person needs to be courageous. He said he would do what he did at Shiloh again. And he did when he went out to fight the Indians.",1487203200,,1007,4.142857142857143
