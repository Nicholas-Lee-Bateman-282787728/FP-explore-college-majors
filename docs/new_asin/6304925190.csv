This was not a special effects, action and suspense filled bonanza... but it WAS a well-told, well-acted representation of events as they would probably play out in the real world.  No ""super-cop to the rescue"", no super-tech evil genius to thwart, no gang-banging baddies to bust.  Just a normal, everyday, life for some school-age students, their teacher and the local cop-shop in a smallish European city --- until an act of terrorism provides and opportunity for individuals to find out their own personal definitions and differences between fear and bravery!

Very interesting mix of bit players as well... where & how did they manage to find the handsome African-American couple (the US diplomat and his family) for the movie?  Their contribution to the overall emotional intensity REALLY sold the movie for us!!  At first we thought --- that Black American couple will be the first to get killed...  but...  (well, we won't spoil it for you --- you just have to watch the movie and see for yourself)!!!",1312848000,,1157,4.989583333333333

I feel that The children play a pivotal role in the affectivness of the emmotional tension in the room.  The performances of Gregory Hall and Just Cirdler were fantastic.",1066176000,,297,4.363636363636363
