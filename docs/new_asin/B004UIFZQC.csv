4467192,5,B004UIFZQC,I have come to like this series and this particular season is also good.  I am definitely a fan and already looking forward to the next set of dvd's.  I watch them over and over.,1316736000,,178,4.057142857142857
4467193,5,B004UIFZQC,"I love this show. It is really great, they really do try their best to help people whether the issue ends up being paranormal or not. This show is so much more worthy than Ghost Hunters. I would love to see more and more from this group!",1316736000,,237,4.0638297872340425
4467194,1,B004UIFZQC,"Must say I have watched this show for the "" entertainment "" value more than anything, but with the latest release totally over it. I am not sure how dedicated the "" team "" is to helping people, if they are at all. It seems they love certain phrases and for people that do this sort of thing they seem VERY alarmed if they think they find something. Notice how the show is more and more of them blurting out and NOT of any real event or pick up, notice how they "" see "" shadows but the camera's never catch a thing, notice how there are hot spots and they seldom watch these area's, notice how short the "" dead "" times actually are, notice how they always do things in the dark for effect when many cases reported have daytime sightings etc.. It may also be my feeling of disappointment but in this last series there are more and more mirrors, more and more shots of Ryan looking at himself in them, surely he has earnt enough money by now to buy his own mirror or is he just vain ????? Maybe the director is possessed by mirror's or his mother was attacked by one but something is strange here and it's not the filmed vision presented which is after all, why one would buy this ! Maybe the most Paranormal thing is why we all still buy this stuff when ...................",1316649600,26,1271,4.213114754098361
4467195,1,B004UIFZQC,"I've been a big fan since the first Season aired on TV back in 2007. Then a few years later I was able to watch and view all season on Netflix in 2010 but I never had a chance to watch Season 5 until now in 2015 on Amazon stream.  I'm a big fan and really like the documentary show with the characters (original Pen State team) and all their interesting paranormal cases, but now that I finally had the chance to watched all of Season 5, I was extremely disappointed in (Episode 21 ""If I Should Die"") with the New Class/ new Pen State team. None of them look like or sounded like they had any kind of paranormal experience, or they didn't even provided any kind of entertaining value.  Thank god A&E did not produce another season with the New Pen State team.  Please bring back the original team, please add a new season starting in 2015 or 2016. Thank you!",1443312000,2,858,4.251533742331288

4467197,5,B004UIFZQC,The book was in great condition and it was delivered as promised. Very happy with my purchase. Would definitely recommend to family and friends.,1432771200,,144,5.041666666666667
4467198,5,B004UIFZQC,I've always liked this show because it has heart and goes into the unknown in a way that both educated and entertains the viewers. Its not silly or even always upbeat but it tackles the unknown in a very professional and engaging way.,1429142400,,234,4.465116279069767
4467199,5,B004UIFZQC,"Very entertaining season of the show.  This set also has an episode of a new paranormal group that has Chip Coffee with them.  I don't think it got picked up for tv though.  While watching this season, I think you can tell Ryan wasn't really into the investigations.  For those who don't know, Ryan stated he was diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer in 2012 but he ended up lying about it.  Ruined his career and he also ripped off a bunch of people from what was reported.  This season also has Katrina in her undies while investigating a haunted bedroom...hello ;)",1427068800,,562,4.57

4467205,4,B004UIFZQC,I was so happy to find PARANORMAL STATE. On Amazon Prime.  I was a fan of the show when it was airing on television. Ryan Buell's approach to addressing the paranormal is much more palatable to me than the bullying we find employed by other paranormal investigators.,1419984000,,266,4.659574468085107
4467206,5,B004UIFZQC,"this movie was great, I love everything about it and it was a little bit scary but well worth watching",1419120000,,102,4.15
4467207,3,B004UIFZQC,"Watch ""Dead Files"", if you want to see an outstanding, and ACCURATE, paranormal investigation. After 4 seasons, Ryan is just ""phoning it in"".It's as if his passion at this point is quite diminished... they don't even rally break out any equipment anymore. It's like... ""Here's what I think off the top of my head. Here's some blessed medals. See ya!"" I liked the show for its time. But, ""Dead Files"" blows everything away.",1418774400,,422,4.794520547945205
4467208,3,B004UIFZQC,"If you are looking for a lot of action packed, gasping and breath holding scenes this is probably not going to satisfy your ghost hunting craves.  The production hones the investigative segment into a shorter ""dead time"" and can spend more of the show on psychological  analysis of those affected.
For those who really enjoy more of the history surrounding the haunt, their coverage is at best fair. If you get tired of  prolonged equipment explanations and  nighttime filming, maybe you'll like this.",1418169600,,501,5.0
4467209,5,B004UIFZQC,I feel in love with this program from the first Season. and have seen them all. They are all worth it !,1418083200,,103,3.727272727272727

4467211,5,B004UIFZQC,I love this show.  I have witnessed several ghost sightings and it's great when someone else validates what you have witnessed yourself.,1417824000,,136,5.181818181818182

4467218,2,B004UIFZQC,"Its is an ok series. Just wish they woukd actually show some of the results from their findings. Like recordings and any video evidence. On a rare occasiin they might, but it is not consistant. Part of the reasons people watch these shows is to see first hand that these things are real.",1415836800,,287,4.433962264150943

4467223,5,B004UIFZQC,I always love paranormal state. This one is a little darker than past ones and deals with some new entities and the group starts asking some different questions.,1414972800,,161,4.785714285714286
4467224,5,B004UIFZQC,Love this show!!! One of the original paranormal reality to air...so sad it's not still on air. I was sad to hear about the founder of Paranormal State...prayers to Ryan Buell...;),1414886400,,180,4.838709677419355
4467225,5,B004UIFZQC,I like this show because they aren't super dramatic like other paranormal investigator shows.,1414800000,,93,5.714285714285714

4467233,5,B004UIFZQC,"This is my favorite of this type of show.  There are a lot of 'ghost hunter' shows on now, but this is one that I don't miss.  I like the way they stick around and at least try to help the people, which most of these shows don't.  I do NOT understand why the newest season is free and the past seasons are charged, but when it is free I will watch.  I NEVER pay to watch, that is why I got rid of CATV!!",1411344000,,403,3.7058823529411766

4467236,3,B004UIFZQC,They have some good spooky stories but always seem to end the investigation just when it starts to get good.,1410480000,,108,4.45
4467237,3,B004UIFZQC,"About the same as most of these kind of shows, but I do like the ""investigating the unknown"" tyoe shows. You have to go in knowing nothing earth-shattering is going to be discovered whether they are hunting ghosts,""squatches"" or ufos. Obviously if they did find something it would be on the news long before the show aired. But they are entertaining and at least make you think. The group of investigators on this show are young and seem to have a fresh perspective on things. The backstories at the homes they investigate are usually interesting too. The episodes are only half an hour so they don't have as much time to show investigations but they also don't have to fill an hour by repeating a possible EVP 30 times.",1410393600,,720,4.589147286821706

4467239,2,B004UIFZQC,It is an entertaining show but idk if its staged at some points. Its aggravating that they don't do EVP sessions standardly at each site. Would watch more seasons if they were included with prime but wouldn't pay more to watch.,1410393600,,227,4.560975609756097
4467240,5,B004UIFZQC,I like the guests that they bring on the show and that it's not an overly dramatic show.,1409961600,,88,3.9444444444444446

4467249,5,B004UIFZQC,"I LOVED THIS SHOW!! It scared the everything out of me. I believed these guys were probably for real if any of em were. So I got frightened out of my gourd several times over 5 years.  Come to find out they might not have been totally on the up and up, but you know how rumors are.  I, however, don't care one way or the other because those scares were my gold standard of scares and I could count on 2 or 3 top of the line ""make your dog walk through the dark room first"" scares.

4467257,2,B004UIFZQC,"Ghost hunters that are afraid of ghosts, a shave headed dope who keeps saying ""what the fu%*, (bleeped of course) and job after job where the ""proof"" is at best debate worthy, makes this a program a loser.  The locations are interesting, and the stories behind the ""ghosts"" give the show some interesting moments but there's nothing really here to keep you watching another episode.",1401494400,,382,4.876923076923077
4467258,3,B004UIFZQC,"My impression of Paranormal State is that there too many characters, too many family members, not enough evidence and too much staged drama. I can't tell you the number of episodes where the end result was a house constructed on an Indian burial ground, or near a burial ground ""where the spirits fly..ooooooooo"" as (Robert Plant sings in Misty Mountain Hop). I hate to be a cynic, but the show follows a trend of geeky PC guy, blonde hot girl in a tank top, 2 tired and fearful victims, photographs or grainy video from some captured moment, research in the local library and random eye witness accounts-Ghost Hunters is about as interesting.",1401408000,,643,4.75

I'm a fan of this type of show and have and continue to watch many of the older established (Paranormal Witness, My Ghost Story) but I have to say that Paranormal State is my favorite.  Great job Ryan & crew - you all are so brave and fearless although I know sometimes you're frightened, I think we know you guys are the real deal because you DO get scared.  I love it when I get the ""What the ****(beep) was that?""  That's what each and every one of us would say if we were in your shoes. Thanks for the education, I consider myself well versed and know that the paranormal is nothing to experiment with or ""try out""...too many inexperienced people don't realize  who or what they could attract and when or where they could mistakenly open a door for a demon to move in.  Keep up the great work.  One area that has always intrigued me is Ryan's childhood experience being tormented or threatened by spirits - if you could, perhaps now is the time to give us more insight into what has brought you to this place in your life.

Even after the investigation, he still left himself open to be contacted for future help. So for all of you that though he and his team, and even roman catholic priest father Bob Bailey were fake, shame on you.

What I Can Tell You:

I am a huge fan of A&E and I am also a huge fan of paranormal shows. Trying not to compare it to other widely popular shows, Paranormal State is headed by Ryan Buell who is also the director seems to really care about his cases. Although he is a little less empathetic than he was in earlier seasons. This series is different from the others because they use a psychic medium and often times bring in a priest to cleanse the house of any spirits. If you enjoy paranormal documentaries you will be interested in Paranorm",1319414400,7,750,4.165517241379311
4467352,2,B004UIFZQC,"First to the technical issues. With all the tech ppl and all the cameras on a computer screen showing multiple rooms, and all the equipment; they never show us one thing beyond the faces of the ppl reacting. They saw something move, saw a shadow, saw a figure. GREAT! Yet there's never any video to show us what they saw. ""Did you hear that?"" ""What was that sound?"" Well gee, who knows since all we as the viewer get to hear is the scary background music they throw in.

I have no doubt the crew is telling the truth as to what they see and hear, but you'd think for a show trying to capture it would actually show us things. We see nothing. This big camera crew and all they focus on is Ryan's face, Katrina's face, Michelle's face, their personal reactions etc..

I'm intrigued by the topic of anything paranormal and this has become such a complete disappointment. There's snipets here and there where you get a moment of excitement because they actually show something for half a second. It's a fleeting moment that passes quickly.

The biggest let down is Ryan himself. His whole reason for starting this quest and all his emotional moments of talking about his experiences as a child and how hard it was for nobody to believe him. He seems to have become very numb to this and now does the same thing to other ppl. In just about every episode, he is so eager to dismiss what the ppl pleading for help are telling him that is going on, what they've seen, what they've heard, and how they've felt.

In his talks with the crew, before he's even met the clients, he makes comments that things are probably hallucinations, bad dreams they probably had, mental issues, and even lying.. the one thing he himself still talks about in an emotional way about being so difficult for him. He seems to have become very numb to the people and more interested in debunking or capturing paranormal activity as his sole purpose of being there in these ppl's homes.

He's lost that compassion he once had in wanting to help ppl and not wanting to make others feel the way he once did in being told he didn't see what he knows he saw. That's what made this show different and made it stand apart from others. He truly cared and wanted to make sure others knew they would finally be believed and someone would understand.

This whole season 5 on every single disc, he does this to every single client by finding a multitude of reasons and excuses for why these ppl say they've seen things instead of just believing and listening as he once did. The only time this changes is if there's things that Ryan himself or someone on the team experiences first hand that can't be explained. Other than that, it's all in their head, there's more to the story, they're hallucinating, having nightmares, and the list goes on. He always tells them he believes they believe what they saw, BUT it's actually probably this this and this. How insulting.

He does this at times before even speaking to the ppl he's supposed to go help. He's completely lost his passion and compassion to help ppl. Even when he appears to help at the end, it's more of going through the motions of having someone come in to bless the house, bringing in a counselor, and the usual things just to make the ppl feel better.

But the actual help isn't there anymore; he's completely lost all the reasons why he started doing this in the 1st place. Oh and if you're a Chip Coffey fan.. Chip only makes one appearance on one short episode throughout the whole 3 disc set.

I'd recommend this for entertainment purposes only for those moments when there's nothing on tv. But overall, it's a huge disappointment. If you want to be scared, order 'A haunting.' If you want real evidence of paranormal activity from ppl who truly want to show the world it exists, order 'Ghost Adventures'. If you want to watch ppl react to things we never see, enjoy.
