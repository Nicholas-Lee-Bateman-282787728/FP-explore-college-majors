8276927,4,B001AD54XE,"I love all these mystery films and this one was a good one.  It is a fairly obscure film from Terry Moore and Debra Paget, but the storyline was original and kept me interested throughout the movie.",1400630400,,198,4.351351351351352
8276928,5,B001AD54XE,I was unable to see this movie as a young man.  I like what I see especially the length of time this movie has been in existence.,1393632000,,129,3.7777777777777777
8276929,4,B001AD54XE,"Crackin' little 60's thriller with debra paget finally getting the ""bad"" girl image/part that she was craving for all her acting career...and she put's in a fine performance too,good support from a good strong cast as well....recommended!",1349222400,,238,5.45945945945946
8276930,4,B001AD54XE,"This film is a rant against the death penalty and a showcase for Terry Moore, which is not surprising since she is also a producer.  All the regular points are made, but I think Ms Moore fails to pull the viewer into sympathy with her characters deepening crises.  What makes the movie watchable is Debra Paget in the smaller role.  Her character is mean, tough as nails, I believe one reviewer said she was miscast, but I disagree because she takes this character from nasty to one afraid, trying to come to grips with the moral dilemma, to trying to do the right thing and she makes you believe the changes,  Difficult, and she does this with a lot less screen time.  So, if you want to watch a good actress work and turn a so so film into a watchable one, watch Ms Paget put on a clinic about character development.  The woman truly believes there are no small parts",1334620800,2,869,4.366459627329193
8276931,5,B001AD54XE,I saw this film for the first time last night.  Great performances by Terry Moore and Debra Paget.  Well worth you time.,1330732800,2,120,4.409090909090909
8276932,4,B001AD54XE,"I first saw this movie as a child and was thrilled to finally be able to see it again on this DVD. Though on any objective scale it is a far lesser film than Susan Hayward's similarly themed I WANT TO LIVE, somehow THIS is the film that managed to stay in my head over the years, the film with the scenes I couldn't forget. Despite its flaws and a certain heavy-handedness, WHY MUST I DIE is still an entertaining film.",1268438400,2,419,4.185185185185185
