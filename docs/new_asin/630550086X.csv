This film was released in both a silent and a sound version, with the sound consisting of a musical score, sound effects, and a few lip-synched lines, all played on a record.  Thus it was that for the first time Tarzan uttered his famous yell.  Okay, this is not the famous yell, but it is the first one.
Despite the title and the oxymoronic idea of tigers in Africa, this serial is actually based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel ""Tarzan and the Jewel of Opar"" and is fairly faithful to both the plot and ERB's depiction of Tarzan as an educated man.  The plot has Tarzan's estate being destroyed by the Arabs of Mohammed Bey (Paul Panzer) and Jane (Natalie Kingston) is sold into slavery by a bad guy (Al Ferguson) pretending to a scientist.  Unfortunately Tarzan takes a blow to the head and develops amnesia, which makes him forget all about Jane when he meets La, Queen of Opar (Kithnou).  That is until Jane goes swimming in what is the most memorable scene in this serial.  The cliffhangers come fast and furious but if you take into account what year this was made they are more enjoyable.
This was Merrill's second appearance as Tarzan after 1928's ""Tarzan the Mighty,"" which was an adaptation of ""The Jungle Tales of Tarzan.""  There were plans for a third film based on ""Tarzan the Terrible,"" but the studio did not think Merrill's voice was going to work when when talkies got going big time.  This version of Tarzan is closer to the Elmo Lincoln style in the 1918 ""Tarzan of the Apes,"" which means lots of lion skins instead of loincloth look that would be in vogue at the end of the pre-code period.  Merrill also has the same muscular build as Lincoln, which would also be replaced by the Olympic swimmer ideal.  ""Tarzan the Tiger"" is more of a historical oddity than anything else, but given all the really bad Tarzan movies out there, this one at least has its head above water.",1068681600,7,2130,4.535248041775457
