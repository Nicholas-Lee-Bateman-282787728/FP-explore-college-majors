897970,5,6304525125,"This is a great DVD with good quality. Some of the other archive collection DVDs have better quality as this one has a couple of places where the voice and lips are not in sync but I still recommend this. I had never seen this movie before buying the DVD but it is very funny and Cary Grant is just wonderful.

All of the Archive Collection DVDs are available from the Turner website for $17.99. Please support Turner with getting more classic movies onto DVD.",1247961600,10,460,4.411764705882353
897971,4,6304525125,"if you want a similarity to ""an affair to remember"" this won't be it but its an entirely charming film , cary grant's performance is really one of his better works. Kerr has been better in other works. Grant, who wants a wife who can ""just find having babies and taking care of a man"" pleasurable , finds a dream wife from the fictitious country of Bookistan. hijinks ensue with Grant trying to get closer to his bride to be, meanwhile Kerr is his translator who follows his every step, not to mention the amusing ""skyscraper"" who knows what lengths Grant will go to to get a simple kiss..
charming. i can see this as a remake but as always the originals are better then potential remakes, and this is no different., worth a watch",1057536000,12,730,4.4148148148148145
897972,3,6304525125,"This is where Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr first displayed the chemistry that worked so memorably in the later AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER.  The plot is silly -Grant dumps workaholic Kerr for simplistic, adoring  ""old-fashioned"" wife-type.  But before the wedding Kerr starts  to educate the meek one.  Except for Grant and Kerr it is a mediocre work.  Oscar nommed for elaborate oriental costuming and Kerr's constantly  changing fashions.",933206400,41,433,5.279411764705882

898098,1,6304525125,"a silly film wasting the talents of three top stars - who would believe Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant would accept such silly roles in a such a silly story. Silly is the word - few laughs, an awful print that is our of character for Warner Archive - soft, not sharp, little contrast, some terrible glitches in the dialogue - more like a pirate copy from a VHS tape. Be warned. Some critics referred to it as ""slight"" but a leading one gave it 1 1/2 star out of 5. That was being generous. Avoid this turkey - the public did! It lost half a million.",1428364800,,546,4.11214953271028

898247,3,6304525125,"Order this because my wife thinks it's one of Cary Grant's best movies! After years of trying to find a DVD copy, we found Amazon had it (was only on VHS just a year ago).This copy is of fair quality, but the audio goes from loud to quite, with sudden drops in the volume throughout the movie (one drop lasted several minutes). As far as the movie goes it's 2 stars at best. I'd never seen the movie before, so we bought it...and besides I'm a big Cary Grant fan so why not get it? Now I know why it's never on TV. The movie is slow, and not at all engaging, it just never comes together to pull you into the plot. However it does have Cary Grant did I say that. As far as being funny (it's supposed to be), I didn't find very many laughs, I may have been amused once or twice at best. Thumbs down on the quality of the DVD, and the Movie!",1369094400,5,839,3.970414201183432

898250,4,6304525125,"This movie isn't a cinamatic masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but it did its job in entertaining me.  There were some places where I literally guffawed. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr had a lovely chemistry that was illuminated every time they made a movie together.  In this film, it was obvious that they were in it to have a good time.  Some of the amusing looks between them came across as absolutely genuine.  I enjoyed this film and think that I'd have no problems watching it again.

Oh, and I would have killed to see this filmed in color just to get the full effect of Deborah Kerr's wardrobe.  Man, that woman wore clothes well!",1319155200,,649,4.504273504273504
898251,1,6304525125,"""Dream Wife"" (1953) marked the inauspicious pairing of Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr - a few years before their classic screen encounter in ""An Affair to Remember."" Director Sidney Sheldon's contrived romantic comedy makes the elegant Grant look foolish and decidedly haggard. Not even the presence of Walter Pidgeon can save this dreary product from the MGM assembly line. Cary's last black-and-white film (and perhaps his weakest).",1311033600,,431,5.447761194029851

7874000,4,6304525125,"Four years before their legendary union in ""An Affair to Remember"", Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant were paired in Sidney Sheldon's battle-of-the-sexes comedy DREAM WIFE.  The sparks fly when Clemson Reade (Grant) returns from the Middle East, where he met a beguiling young princess, with new opinions on what makes the 'perfect wife'.  His long-time fiancee Priscilla 'Effie' Effington (Kerr) decides to indulge Clemson's fantasies, and brings the lovely Princess Tarji (Betta St. John) to America.  At first things couldn't be better - Tarji is the perfect obedient young woman, demurring to Clem in every way.  But then Effie decides that Tarji needs a few American-style lessons...

Reunited with Sheldon (""The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer""), Cary Grant again displays his comedic skills, and Deborah Kerr is lovely wearing an array of Helen Rose designer gowns.  Betta St. John (imported from Broadway where she had made a big splash playing Liat in the original cast of ""South Pacific"") isn't patently 'Arabian' by any stretch of the imagination but fills her role delightfully.

This DVD of DREAM WIFE was one of the original titles offered through the Warner Archive manufacture-on-demand programme, and the quality isn't the best.  The soundtrack volume fluctuates, and there is at least one portion of the film where the soundtrack goes noticeably out of synch.  The film opens with the old Turner logo, so I imagine this is an older VHS master.  I'm happy to say that the quality of the titles offered in the Warner Archive programme has improved in leaps and bounds since the programme started in 2009.  Perhaps one day, Warner Archive may decide to go back and remaster this film (which they have done with select titles in the past).

This is probably the best we'll get, but in the meantime it doesn't really deter from the enjoyment of seeing Deborah and Cary in their first film together.",1435622400,3,1902,5.022292993630574

It was a fun movie to watch and I especially enjoyed some of the comedy when all the guys got into a fight. I thought that Walter Pidgeon was excellent, too. I liked every thing about Dream Wife. It was great to watch all of these excellent actors at this particular stage in their careers. I enjoyed it very much and would recommend this movie to old movie fans or followers of those great actors.",1432684800,5,555,4.196261682242991
