7035661,5,B00UBZLI00,"No one has been better at the comedic insult than Rickles. His humor has stood the test of time. No matter how many times I watch the Dean Martin celebrity roasts I still laugh over and over when he's at the dais. He never had much success with any of his TV shows, but most fans would consider CPO Sharkey to have been his most successful, even though it only lasted 2 seasons. Like the celebrity roasts, the CPO Sharkey material was funny but what made it suburb was his timing and delivery. The series premise was perfect for Rickles's comedic style with a ethnic group of naval recruits playing to his brand of humor, and a semi-hapless assistant. Though not quite the same concept as the Phil Silvers show where Bilko was the consummate lovable con-man platoon leader for new recruits, the Sharkey character was pretty close. I've been hoping this short-run TV series would be released some day, so I'm very excited to see it's now available. The other thing about CPO Sharkey (and the Sgt. Bilko series) is that it isn't necessary for someone to have served in the military to get the humor. Although having served, I can attest there are a few hidden gems that hit home (especially around going through the boot camp experience).",1432252800,,1236,4.622727272727273

Stand-up comedian Don Rickles made a career out of insult humor and politically incorrect jokes aimed at all races. So what better sitcom for him to star in than one that has him playing a Chief Petty Officer at a U.S. Naval training facility in San Diego, where he gets to go off on recruitsespecially when those recruits include a Polish American, a Jewish American, an Italian American, and a Puerto Rican?

Call it Sgt. Bilko revisited, because Rickles is surprisingly good at playing a tough, acerbic CPO with a warm heart. The show lasted only two seasons, but its not because the sitcom isn't funny or because the cast isn't likeable. My guess is that it was another case of bad timing. The public already had one sitcom with politically incorrect humor, and did America really want or need another Archie Bunker?

Thats not fair, though, because Bunker was racist without knowing or admitting it. He tolerated black neighbors but wasn't really friends with them. Sharkey is best buddies with fellow CPO Dave Robinson (Harrison Page), an African American with whom he feels comfortable enough to make racial jokes. Notice I said racial, not racist. Theres a difference, and in todays hyper-politically correct world that difference isn't acknowledgedhence the warning on the back of this DVD: Some of the jokes and ethnic references heard in these episodes would most likely not be allowed on network TV today and reflect the tenor of the times. Because of that racial humor, CPO Sharkey will only be for families with children old enough to realize that such jokes cant be made today, no matter how fond you are of a person.

Still, CPO Sharkey is a refreshing change from the steady diet of family sitcoms that TV serves up, and its also a part of television history. The series big claim to fame is a tie-in to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Rickles appeared on the show, as he often did, and with guest host Bob Newhart presiding slammed down a cigarette box that Carson kept on his desk. But the gag went wrong, because Rickles accidentally broke the box. The next night, after Carson discovered what happened, he took his camera crew to the studio next door where CPO Sharkey was being filmed and interrupted the filming. That stunt is included here as a bonus feature, and as an artifact of a bygone era of television its pretty fun to watch. So are the episodes.

This first season a female commander (Elizabeth Allen) takes over, after Sharkey swore hed quit if the Navy ever admitted women. CPO Sharkey was based on contrasts, and that included a 67 tall aide named Pruitt (Peter Isacksen) that Sharkey had to get on a stool to go eye-to-eye with. Some of the humor is topical and has lost its comic edge, but the bulk of the jokes are of the insult varietywhat Rickles was known forand that never goes out of style. Just ask your junior high or high school family members.

This season, Sharkey adjusts to having a woman CO, a recruit wants out of the unit because he thinks Sharkey is prejudiced, Robinson thinks Sharkey is a ladies man when he glimpses a note in his typewriter, the men smuggle in an inflatable female doll (dont ask), a shy recruit announces hes marrying a cocktail waitress after two dates, the men mutiny over boot camp, Kowalski sleepwalks, Sharkey has to go to Tijuana to bail his men out of jail, some of the recruits get in trouble for sneaking women into the barracks (a step up from inflatables, at least), Sharkey and Robinson boogie on down to celebrate a birthday, Sharkey contemplates moving to a quiet apartment, the recruits mistakenly think Sharkey is gay, Pruit plans an end-of-training party without consulting Sharkey, and a wino who spent the night in the barracks complicates final inspection.

In a letter to fans thats included here, Rickles says the show was a labor of love and that the Navy is close to his heart because as an 18-year-old enlistee he served during WWII on a mother ship that took care of PT boats. I hope that this collection brings you some good laughs, Rickles says. And though there are a few clunkers or head-snappers, for the most part it does.

Language: Tame, but the insult humor and rude humor can seem abrasive
Sex: Some talk, some situations
Violence: N/A
Adult situations: Some drinking,
Takeaways: Its hard to believe what TV got away with in the 70s, and CPO Sharkey deserved more than a two-season run.

7035663,5,B00UBZLI00,"This is a real treat for Don Rickles fans.  Rickles did not do a lot of scripted television, so having ""CPO Sharkey"" back is a great way to watch the master of insult comedy in action.  The setting is a Naval recruit center in California and Rickles is a Navy ""lifer"" trying to adjust to modern times.  He pines for the good old days when things were less complicated and less politically correct.  Of course his company of recruits has a Polish kid, a Jewish kid, a Japanese kid, a Puerto Rican kid, etc.  This set-up allows Rickles to riff on cultural and ethnic differences.  Some of the jokes have a real bite and you realize most of today's comedy begins here (and with Saturday Night Live, which started at this time in the mid-1970s).  If it was just RIckles insulting those around him, ""CPO Sharkey"" would get old real fast.  However, they softened Sharkey just enough to make him believably human.  CPO Sharkey cares for his recruits and most of his schemes are aimed at making life better for these young people.  Sharkey's plans almost always go wrong, but he never loses his misplaced self-confidence.  Watching Rickles strut around as a ""sex symbol"" (as he believes he is) is a riot.  And no one - no one - does the ""pop-eyed stare"" better than Don Rickles.  Very funny stuff.  Very addictive.",1431475200,8,1306,4.573275862068965

7035665,5,B00UBZLI00,". Don Rickles, who plays Chief Petty Officer Sharkey, based at a naval recruit training center in California does what he's best known for in his stand-up comedy skits.

7035704,3,B00UBZLI00,"CPO Sharkey  Season One

Seven years had passed since Gomer Pyle (Jim Nabors) and his overbearing Drill Instructor Sergeant Carter (Frank Sutton) were marching across the television screens, and since then we had five years of Archie Bunker drilling us full of his perspective.

With NBC scrambling for a hit in 1976 they called upon comedy legend Don Rickles and CPO Sharkey was born.  Not nearly as intimidating as Carter nor as ignorant as Bunker, Sharkey trained, counseled, and occasionally mothered, the diverse group of men in his charge.  The men each represented a stereotype familiar to the audience of 1976 and perfectly walked both Rickles and the audience to the punchline they were waiting for.

Rickles had become known for his willingness to insult anyone and everyone regardless of their heritage, sex, social or political standing, and everyone lined up to see him perform.  NBC was banking on audiences doing the same.  Nonetheless, the second episode of the series (Shimokawa Ships Out) is clearly written to make sure the audience understands the humor of Don Rickles by emphasizing that he treats everyone the same.  Not necessarily well, but the same.  Unfortunately that is not the only episode that is written with obvious intent.

The first season of CPO Sharkey is now out on DVD and like many of the shows in the seventies; CPO Sharkey simply tries too hard.  The scripts are written to hit the audience over the head with the jokes; the actors portraying the recruits are a bit too old for the roles and far too obvious with the characterizations.  The highlight is the relationship between Sharkey and fellow Chief Robinson (Harrison Page).  There is clearly mutual respect in this relationship which allows Robinson to be mentor, confidant, and antagonist.  The performance of Page is one of the highlights of the series as he is the least cartoon like.

With binge watching becoming so common, it draws immediate attention to the shows like Sharkey which simply don't hold up if you watch them more than one episode per week.  The jokes and gags are extremely repetitive and the effort to make Im gonna keep my eye on you a catch phrase just becomes sad.

There is one piece of bonus material but be prepared that once you select it, it starts a bit abrupt with no set-up.  We see Rickles fumbling with the cigarette case on the desk of Johnny Carson during an appearance on The Tonight Show with guest host Bob Newhart. This section is quite brief as we then go to the return of Carson in a future episode where he notices that the case is now broken.  Finding out that Rickles had broken it; he takes his cameras next door where CPO Sharkey is being filmed and interrupts the shoot to confront Rickles.  Much fun despite the poor presentation on the DVD.

Recommendation: CPO Sharkey has become a contradiction that may actually work in this day and age.  The material of Rickles as delivered in these situations is now considered politically incorrect while the characters and premises are almost cartoon like, so, CPO Sharkey should fit right in on todays television landscape.  Rent it and watch it in small doses.  Better yet; get out and see Rickles live while you still can.",1432684800,5,3214,4.81056466302368
