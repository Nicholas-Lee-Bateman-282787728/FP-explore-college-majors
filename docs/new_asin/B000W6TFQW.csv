8221352,2,B000W6TFQW,"Framed for Murder isn't one of the better made originally for TV movies out there.  To say it's extremely predictable would be an understatement.  This 2007 made movie has Elisa Donovan (Clueless) as a wife who on the end of a violent usual assault from her husband while he makes fun of her medical bipolar issues defends herself with a statue knocking her husband to the floor, grabs their son and runs out the door leaving it wide open.  But his corpse is discovered and she goes to jail for eight years.  Her sister raises her kid and now she's out and eager to get on with her life and be a mother again.  But her sister's husband (Perry King) clearly doesn't like her, or the fact she wants to investigate what really happened 8 years ago, now that she remembers some of it and knows her husband was grabbing for her ankles when she fled.  He doesn't like her best friend who served time with her either coming over to his mansion.  But she's not going to stop until she's cleared her name, unless the real murderer stops her.

Framed for Murder was just so predictable.  You knew both who obviously murdered the husband and you could also work out why.  You also knew what their plan was now long before any of it went into motion.  Also stars Susan Walters (Delores - Seinfeld, Carol - The Vampire Diaries),  and Sophie Gendron (just about every TV movie made around the time this one was).",1502755200,,1398,4.43921568627451

8221355,4,B000W6TFQW,"I really enjoyed this movie when it came on T.V. (Lifetime), that's why I ordered the movie.  Of course Amazon had it.  I really love amazon because it carries mostely everything you need.  However, this is a really good movie if you're just in the mood to watch television sometimes.  I don't want to tell you the movie, but who would ever think who the killer was.  I had an idea but didn't want to believe it.  Get the movie its a good movie watch.",1242604800,5,451,4.247058823529412
