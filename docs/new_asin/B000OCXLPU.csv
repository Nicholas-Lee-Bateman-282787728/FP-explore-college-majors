It is nothing like the book. I realized this before even seeing the movie from watching previews! The only thing that is the same are the names of the characters and that they are werewolves. Everything else, including where the events are happening, are completely different. If you've seen the book, don't watch it. If you haven't read the book, this movie is pretty good. I just can't stand it because its nothing like my beloved book. They ruined it.",1179619200,2,605,4.410714285714286
2793275,2,B000OCXLPU,"When we saw the trailer for this movie several months ago, we thought that this was one of the worse titles for a werewolf movie--or any movie for that matter. The question is; where was Willy Wonka? Maybe he would have had a better a time playing with these wolves than eating chocolate.

""Blood and Chocolate""--from the German independent film director Katja von Garnier--tells the story of a young woman named Vivian (Agnes Brunkner) who happens to be a sexy she-wolf. She lives in the outskirts of Bucharest, Romania along with hundreds of her kind--during the day she works in a chocolate factory. Their secret society (loux garoux), must remain unknown to the rest of humanity--if any human comes across them, they will meet an unfortunate end. Vivian longs for a loving relationship but unfortunately, she is not attracted to any of the other werewolves--the alpha males--that are in the pack. While hanging out in an old church, she comes across a man named Aiden (Hugh Dancy), and they fall in love--Vivian decides for now to hide her real identity. Their romance, of course, does not go well with Gabriel ([Oliver Martinez] who is the leader of the werewolves), because of the strict laws of their society. He must take a bride every seven years and Vivian has been destined to be Gabriel's next bride. Will Vivian succumb to Gabriel or will she go with Aiden?

The director of this film (Katja von Garnier) has never done a horror movie--it shows--but has done more films dealing with woman relationships. She takes a different perspective with ""Blood and Chocolate"" (based on a romantic supernatural (werewolf) novel for young adult readers by Annette Curtis Klause.)

Katja von Garnier is more interested in the modern trend of ""cool visuals"" supernatural horror movies. To follow this new style, she gets an army of Calvin Klein like models who look like manikins and as a result, the move suffers. Also the close-up cinematography is dull and makes these characters look lifeless.

The screenplay adapted by Christopher Landon gives us a shallow story--something what would be accepted from a soap opera theme--with neither a strong romantic theme nor horror suspense that the book offered. In other words, Blood and Chocolate doesn't know if it wants to be a horror film or a dark romance.

Even the transformation from human to werewolf is pretty amusing and has no interesting qualities as werewolf films from the past. No signs of neither the terrible anguish of ""An American Werewolf in London"" or the sadistic delight of ""The Howling"". Instead, the audience views a very magical/spiritual type of outcome. In this film, humans change into werewolves by diving like Olympic swimmers with a glowing aura, then change almost instantaneously into ordinary wolves. To make things worse, the camera shows different angles of perspective as they are leaping--which reminds us of Lassie as a wolf.

If you never read this review, you will probably think this movie is about a sadistic killer who likes chocolate. However, if you have never seen a classic werewolf movie, then you will think werewolf movies are about young women who live in Romania. They have love affairs with humans, and work in chocolate factories. A movie like this cannot be recommended unless you have a sweet tooth for chocolate--or better yet, spend your money on a real Hershey's instead.",1179187200,4,3377,4.9787234042553195
2793276,2,B000OCXLPU,"Blood and Chocolate is based on a young adult novel of the same title.  I read the novel awhile ago and had mixed feelings about it--the writing was good, but there were a few characters I really didn't like, and I found the ending disappointing and rushed.  I knew, however, that certain things would be changed in the movie, so I thought it might be an improvement.  I probably should have known better.

The movie doesn't even vaguely resemble the book...which might be okay if it told a good story in its own right, but it was riddled with so many irritating things I don't know where to start.  The opening flashback is confusing and poorly handled.  Using a narrator to convey backstory is lazy storytelling, but it's even worse when the narrator has nothing important to say.

Some of the dialogue is so poorly written it's actually funny, though I don't think it's supposed to be.  Case in point, Aiden says to Vivian, ""If you cared a damn thing about me, you'd have left me before we ever met!""  I can't believe that line made it to the screen--didn't anyone edit this script?

The special effects are kind of ho-hum.  The transformation sequences, which you'd think would be the highlight of a werewolf movie, are glossed over--characters are simply human one moment and wolves the next.  And no one has to get undressed to transform, so apparently their clothes somehow disappear or transform with them.

Say what you will about the book's Vivian, at least she had a personality.  In the movie, Vivian has all the personality of a goldfish.  Aiden's not much better, having been transformed into a standard action hero who delivers quips like, ""Drink up"" before dousing bad guys with alcohol and setting them on fire.  Gabriel was a ""good guy"" in the book and is supposed to be a villain in the movie, though strangely enough, I found him less irritating in the movie.

The movie's not a complete waste of time.  There were parts of it that held my attention.  But overall, there was just too much silliness for me to recommend it.",1178668800,8,2042,4.637883008356546
2793277,2,B000OCXLPU,"I was really excited about seeing this movie when I heard what it was about.  I was expecting something fantastic because the plot sounded really good and creative.  However, when I finally got to see the movie I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the production.  I think the only thing I really enjoyed was the detail displayed in the gothic like scenery and I didn't think they did that bad of a job turning humans into wolves.  Although, with all of the technological advances of the day, I think they could have had something more impressive.  Overall, I don't think this movie is worth owning and it disappointed me.",1177632000,13,632,4.657657657657658
2793278,5,B000OCXLPU,"the movie blood and chocolate was very good. yes its true they did stray from the book but all in all it was a very good movie.

2793279,4,B000OCXLPU,"""Blood and Chocolate,"" despite its outward appearance as a modern-day werewolf story, seems more like a commentary on cultural understanding. This is something I initially didn't think possible, considering how classic stories like ""The Wolf Man"" portray werewolves as unsympathetic monsters. But on reflection, such an idea makes perfect sense: werewolves are shunned by human society due to their ravenous canine appetites, making any attempt at coexistence seem pointless and subtracting; likewise, werewolves are forced to live as outcasts merely for trying to survive. While ""Blood and Chocolate"" doesn't explore this theme in depth, enough is given to make the message clear to the audience. However, I can't say whether or not this makes the film good; it has some glaring flaws, most notably the fact that the entire werewolf mythos is barely developed.

Nonetheless, I'll go out on a limb and give the film four stars. I think what I found most enticing was the character of Vivian (Agnus Bruckner), who's full of teenage angst despite being in her early twenties. The film begins ten years ago in Denver, Colorado, where we see Vivian's parents murdered by a heavily armed group of men. We have yet to understand why such a terrible thing has happened; all we're initially told is that, in the present day, she lives in Romania with her aunt, Astrid (Katja Riemann). We also learn that she's a Rougarou--another term for a werewolf--the descendent of a long line of canine hunters. Contrary to popular belief, Rougarous are not affected by the full moon, and they have complete control over when and where they transform.

Unfortunately, being a Rougarou has its drawbacks, the most obvious one being they have to hide their true natures from the human population. They're also a traditional race of beings, adhering strictly to the belief that werewolves can only be romantically involved with werewolves. The reason is simple: if involved with a human, a Rougarou risks exposure and the possibility of extinction. But for Vivian, these rigid restrictions pale in comparison to the belief that she's mentioned in an ancient prophesy. Apparently, she will one day lead Rougarous into a new age of hope, free from the fear, pain, and hopelessness they've had to endure. Because of this, her future has already been planned; she's been chosen to be the mate of Gabriel (Olivier Martinez), the current leader of the pack. (I found this a little odd; Gabriel is also Astrid's lover, and their son is Vivian's cousin. Is incest always necessary in such stories?)

As you may have surmised, Vivian is a free spirit, and she views her current life as nothing but a prison. Her only escape is running around the local park, which is clearly symbolic of running away from her problems. She will never accept Gabriel, especially since she's expected to do so. But despite her convictions, she's weary of the unknown, which is exactly what she sees in Aiden (Hugh Dancy), an American graphic novelist. There's a definite attraction at work here, made stronger by the fact that Aiden also comes from a strict family that had expectations. When they meet, Vivian smiles for the first time, which, under these circumstances, is always indicative of someone trying to find his or her place; she may physically belong to a pack of superhuman creatures, but her mind and heart are unbounded.

Of course, Gabriel finds this unacceptable. So does his son, Rafe (Bryan Dick), who's so arrogant and hotheaded that one can't help but hate him. Moments between him and Vivian are always tense, and they're made worse by his consistently condescending attitude. Both he and his father vow to rid themselves of Aiden, not only for Vivian's own good, but for the good of the entire Rougarou species, as well. Unfortunately, they have yet to understand that Aiden is quite capable of defending himself (thanks to being raised by an abusive father).

As the film builds to a climax, Vivian's emotions are running higher than they've ever run: is she to remain loyal to her own kind, or is she to find happiness with an outsider she truly cares about? I found this dilemma interesting, especially since it's utilized in a werewolf story; she and Aiden may be of a different species, but that doesn't mean that she's incapable of showing him love. She also recognizes that Gabriel's hatred for humanity is fueled by fear. This is shown in a scene involving a ritual, one in which a human is forced to run through the forest while being chased by werewolves. If the human can make it to a river, his or her life will be spared (but it won't be easy; the human is cut before he or she runs, and the smell of blood drives the wolves crazy).

Such barbaric treatment brings the film's message out into the open: if there's to be any hope for a new beginning amongst Rougarous, such negative emotions have to be set aside. I'm sure some of you are thinking that I'm looking at ""Blood and Chocolate"" too closely; isn't it just a supernatural thriller about werewolves? Maybe so, but I'd like to think there's something more to it, something that can be cleverly disguised as a meaningless movie. I see it as a story of identity and acceptance, of tolerance and existence. While none of these qualities make for a particularly original story, at least they make for a more satisfying experience at the movie theater.",1170115200,16,5389,4.864923747276689
2793280,2,B000OCXLPU,"SPOILERS for the movie and the book.

I thought this movie might be in trouble when I saw the trailer weeks before its release date and the theater audience howled with derisive laughter at the trailer voice-over's oh-so-dramatic unveiling of the awkward title: ""BLOOD...AND CHOCOLATE."" The thing is, people who haven't read the book wouldn't get the seemingly incongruous title. In Annette Curtis Klause's 1999 Young Adult novel (read it eons ago), BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE was a metaphor for Vivian's internal struggle between her werewolf heritage (the ""blood"") and her desire for a human boy (the ""chocolate""). Here, the ""chocolate"" part seemingly refers to her being employed in a chocolate shop.

But let's get to the movie plot. In contemporary Bucharest, one of the very last wolf packs on earth survives and continues to hunt. Vivian Gandillon (Agnes Bruckner) is a troubled (but hot) young werewolf, haunted by a tragic past. She revels in running thru the Romanian woods but abhors the pack's bloodcurling tendency to chase down the occasional human victim. Vivian spends her days toiling away in a chocolate shop and her nights haunting the hot Bucharest night spots. One evening, while hanging out in a desolate chapel, she has a chance encounter with Aiden (Hugh Dancy), an artist who is researching the legends of the loup garoux (werewolves) for his next graphic novel. He's interested. She is, too, but rebuffs him. He persists and she succumbs to seeing him. Of course, they fall in love. Of course, it's not quite that easy.

As per ancient custom, it seems that the leader of the werewolf pack, Gabriel (Olivier Martinez), must take a new wife every seven years and has been eyeing Vivian for his latest bride; so he's not about to let some human get in his way. Add to that the unsavory capers perpetrated by Viv's cousin Rafe (Bryan Dick) and his clique, the ""Five,"" and the love story of Vivian and Aiden threatens to fizzle out before its time. Shades of Capulet and Montague!

I wondered if the film would be able to survive the burden of an incongruous title. Sadly...no. BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE suffers firstly from having a PG-13 rating as the movie finds itself reduced to a fangless state, with neither enough goriness nor titillation. Too, this film horribly butchers Annette Curtis Klause's popular book. Readers of the novel are bound to be disappointed and even heart-broken by all the changes made to make the feature more ""Hollywood,"" as the book's core story is basically gutted, leaving the character names and the lycantrophic premise as the sole survivors of the wholesale alterations. Briefly, some of the things that were changed: in the movie, the story is set in Bucharest, Romania, instead of in the U.S.; in the movie, Vivian works in a chocolate shop, instead of being in high school; Vivian's mother isn't present in the film (she has a key role in the book); also, the book depicts Vivian as embracing her werewolfness; and, importantly, the natures of Gabriel and Aiden have been drastically modified.

A word to the gorehound: the film focuses more on the romantic aspect than the horror elements. In fact, I wasn't too impressed with the horror elements or the action sequences. Here, when the werewolves transform, they do so in a sterilized blur, instead of the nifty, gory and messy gradual segue from man to monster. And since these are the same producers who did UNDERWORLD, I guess they're trying to make Vivian over in Kate Beckinsale's Selene mold. But I think there are enough film babes out there who deliver these same trite action scenes. Meanwhile, the special effects are serviceable, if ho-hum.

The actors are gorgeous but prove to be inconsequential. Agnes Bruckner and Hugh Dancy have some chemistry, but their ponderous acting serves to sabotage their rapport. Olivier Martinez, to me, is just miscast for the role of the heavy. Maybe it's too hard to be villainous when you have a French accent, unless everyone in the cast is French. Or maybe Martinez is just too...lightweight.

Another drawback. I've always thought there was an element of tragedy in the werewolf mythos, of being forced to become a ravening beast against your will and losing all control and inhibition when the moon is full. But, in this movie, the moon's phase isn't much of a factor as the pack can transform at will. To me, this takes away some of the tension and part of the allure of the werewolf mythos. As well with this movie's proposition that werewolves can't infect their victims and ""turn"" them. You're either born a loup garou or you're not. This premise also takes away from some of the implied peril in the movie. When in a zombie, vampire, or werewolf flick, one of the biggest fears and carriers of suspense is that the viewer's favorite characters might become infected.

Now I realize that part of my lukewarm reaction to this flick is that, after all these years, I still fondly remember the book I've read. I've pretty much accepted that when a great book becomes a movie, it loses something in translation. Every now and then, you do have superb film renditions of books (TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, LORD OF THE RINGS, HARRY POTTER...) or, even in rare instances, a film that improves on the book (TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT), but mostly, we'll get efforts like BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE. So let me say this, if I haven't read the book, I probably would've rated this film higher, maybe three stars. I'm usually pretty generous and I normally enjoy supernatural/fantasy horror features. But I have read the book and anjoyed it, and I'm a bit put out that so much was changed. Add to that the fact that the film's story is rife with cliches, the dialogue is boring, and the acting is only so-so. So, two stars from me, one star because Agnes Bruckner is hot.

But, hey, at least Uwe Boll didn't direct this one, right?",1169856000,92,5857,4.802579365079365

2793307,4,B000OCXLPU,"The werewolf, fighting a dual nature, troubled by the demands of both human hungers and pack loyalties, is a theme that has been played by many, notably Herman Hesse in ""Steppenwolf<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steppenwolf-A-Novel/dp/B00AQUTONI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steppenwolf: A Novel</a>."" The novel ""Blood & Chocolate<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-and-Chocolate/dp/0385734212/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood and Chocolate</a>"" by Annette Curtis Klause, on which the film's screenplay is based, was even titled in reference to a Steppenwolf quote: ""I had the taste of blood and chocolate in my mouth, one as hateful as the other.""

The teen loup-garou of Klause's novel adds puberty and normal teenage angst to her troubles. The novel has Vivian Gandillon living in a suburb in Maryland when her father dies, leaving the pack leaderless.

In the movie, set in Bucharest, Bruckner's Vivian is an American ex-pat whose parents were killed by a human mob in the States. We get some clues that Vivian blames herself for their deaths. Living now with her aunt in Romania, she is being groomed as mate to Gabriel (played by Oliver Martinez), the much-older pack leader. who trades in each wife for a new one on a 5-year cycle. (This behavior, so un-wolf-like, is never explained. It appears to serve mainly to show that Gabriel is more of an animal than a ""civilized man."")

In both stories, additional conflict is supplied by the advent of Aidan (the Hugh Dancy role), a non-werewolf (""meat"") boy near Vivian's age, whom she meets and falls in love with. In both, a rogue loup-garou who has given in to his wolf nature commits a murder that threatens to expose the pack.

Vivian's feelings of guilt about the death of her parents, her confusion about her feelings for Aidan, and her determination not to kill in the persona of the wolf, are presented in such a light-handed way that the viewer might miss the deeper conflict going on here. It is the same as Hesse's Steppenwolf fought: the desire not to allow the animal in our natures to rule the human spirit.

Liner Notes:
*  There are apparently many wolf images to be seen in Bucharest. The film includes a number of them; some in the foreground, and some as fleeting glimpses.
*  Multiple members of the cast and crew were named Vlad or Radu; single instances of Zoltan, Bogdan, Silviu, and Razvan also scrolled past in the end credits. Obviously, the location shots in the city of Bucharest were not the only thing giving local ""flavor"" to the film.",1455494400,,2596,5.271186440677966

If you are hoping to watch it after reading the book DO NOT. The book is completely different. The werewolf transformation was basically into a regular wolf.

All those story changes for the movie, because why bother using the plot of the book you bought the rights to and made a movie out of, result in a boring, cliched clunker about some insipid people you just can't care about.  It's a movie script guided by a committee of completely unnovel thinkers, who spend too much time on tvtropes.com.  Do yourself a favor, and read the book instead.

2793392,3,B000OCXLPU,"Too many of the reviews are about comparing this film to the book of the same name.  The film always come up short because of the altered plot.  I for one am only going to review the film on its own.
After completing it I was not impressed.  I don't care about graphics or disparaging plots between the script and a teen book or any other such discrepancies.  No, what I found slightly disturbing was that I did not sympathize with the heroine.  **Spoiler**  I did not like it that in order for her to ""get away"" she had to kill her own people.  In order to be free she had to leave everything that wasn't human behind.  And she had to do all this by destroying her past, culture, and familial history.  It seems too often in this day and age we are encouraged and sometimes even demanded to let go of tradition that is seemed too old fashioned.  The logic behind her reasoning for doing what she did was weak and too new-age.  I could practically see some self-help guru's words coming out of her mouth.  I think this film would have done better and perhaps even have soothed the book fan's ruffled insulted feathers that instead of taking the easy route of choosing either human or animal they delved deeper and found a way for balance between modern change and unchanging tradition. The whole thing was such a shame, there was so much potential.",1380326400,,1348,4.412955465587045

2793423,3,B000OCXLPU,"Vivian's decision to run against the pack places her new boyfriend in mortal danger in BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE, adapted from the popular teen novel by Annette Curtis Klause. This pre-TWILIGHT romantic Horror film finds trouble balancing the two genres, and often delivers more unintentional humor than terror or suspense while forging several regretful similarities to AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS. The unconvincing cast causes the film to fall flat on more than one occasion, especially throughout the passionless performances by the two young lovers. In the rush to introduce the players and establish the growing conflict within the pack, director Katja von Garnier neglects to develop any form of rapport between Agnes Bruckner and Hugh Dancy, and even less of an emotional connection between the characters and the audience. What we are left with is a Horror movie without any scares, and a Romance that is rife with cliches, but lacking in true love.

2793455,1,B000OCXLPU,"I read the book when it first came out in 99 when I was just a kid and I thought it was the GREATEST thing in the entire world. It has been my favorite book ever since. When my sister and I heard they were making a movie about it we were so excited, then we saw the trailer for it...and it was like ""Okay, this doesn't seem right at all but we'll give it the benefit of the doubt"". When I saw this movie there are not enough words to describe my disappointment. This movie is NOTHING like the book. If you've read the book than AVOID the movie because all it will do is tick you off beyond belief. The only things that were the same in the book and the movie was the character names, werewolves, and a few of the love triangles. When my sister and I saw the movie we just looked at each other and went ""What the hell happened? That's nothing like the book, not even close. How can they call it 'Blood and Chocolate'?"" I know that when books are turned into movies things aren't going to be exactly the same, but COME ON, I expect at least the story line to be close! This movie was just horrible and shouldn't have been allowed to have been made.

2793458,2,B000OCXLPU,Did not like this movie at all.  The story did not make any sense.  There was more blood than chocolate.,1353715200,,104,4.15
2793459,2,B000OCXLPU,"First off, I read Annette Curtis Klause's wonderful book (of the same title) when I was about thirteen or fourteen and I remember being so blown away by the amazing story and wonderfully thought out charecters that when I loaned my copy of the book out to a friend some years later and never got it back, I was devestated until I managed to scrounge up a used copy at a bookstore. I saw the movie almost five years ago and remember going, WHAT THE F*&^! I don't even know why I'm bothering to review now, but I guess its because a part of me just wants to lament over the butchering of a fantastic book by Hollywood.
First things first: the storyline is so off it's ridiculous. Vivian and her pack lived in the US, not Romania! Vivian's mother, Esme, was a HUGE part of the book, I couldn't believe it when her charecter was completely scrapped in the movie version. And no one's mentioned Astrid...I was so excited to see how the movie would portray a complicated villaness like she was in the book...imagine my disbelief when they portrayed Astrid as Vivian's loving aunt! No way that should have been allowed, in the book, Astrid tries to kill Vivian not once, but twice.

I REALLY, REALLY wanted to see how the producers described 'The Old Way' or the fight ritual in which the male werewolves battle in their wolf-skin for control of the pack. That wasn't even included. I wanted to see the gore, I wanted them to re-create the world that Curtis-Klause made you see, smell and almost touch in her book...this movie has none of that. The only things it kept were the premise of werewolves and the names of the charecters. It also kind of irked me that the producers introduced the idea of werewolves being able to 'control' their change, as in mind over matter. Sorry, but traditional werewolf folklore just does not work that way. Even in the book, the members of the pack had limited control over the ability to change...they could if they wanted to, but at other times they have no choice, just like the werewolves of old.

The cast was so-so. I really was not expecting Oliver Martinez as Gabriel, and it just did not sit well with me, the idea of this power mad leader that the movie describes him as....no humanity at all....whereas in the book, Gabriel is complicated and extremely conflicted over his double identity and sometimes comes off as the most human in the way he cares for and protects his pack. Agnes Bruckner is lovely as Vivian but her acting leaves something to be desired.

All in all, if you read the original Blood and Chocolate and loved it, stay far, far away from the movie version. I guarantee you, you will be very dissapointed to the point of sadness. It's nothing but the name and a waste of a good 2 1/2 hours of your life. I'm shocked that this mockery was even allowed to retain the original title. It certainly does not deserve it.",1346112000,,2871,4.496168582375479
2793460,1,B000OCXLPU,I did not like the movie because I have the book and I think the movie was a total waste of time if they just placed the movie in a different country and changed all the characters and their purpose in the book. I would not recommend this movie to anyone,1343433600,,254,4.0

2793462,3,B000OCXLPU,"After some events took place in Colorado years before, we are in Romania where a young woman named Vivian (Agnes Bruckner, ""The Woods"") is living with her aunt and Vivian hides a terrible secret, she's a werewolf and part of a clan and due to a pact by her father she is promised to the leader Gabriel (Oliver Martinez, ""Unfaithful""). She of course is very skeptical of this and also falls for a young man named Aiden (Hugh Dancy, ""King Arthur"") who is great at drawing. After her cousin Rafe gets in Gabriel's ear about how Vivian loves another, the decision must be made to choose her family lineage or go with the young Aiden?

There's romance, intrigue (well not really), some cool effects, lots of young pretty people dancing around to various songs (at least in the beginning minutes), some attacks by the wolves including a hunting sequence where they chase a drug dealer through the woods. The acting is typical but not bad, the dialogue is standard and ok and while nothing new at all I certainly wouldn't say this as nearly as bad as other werewolf or monster movies that have been released in the past few years.

The cast is also not too bad, Agnes is very attractive and a decent lead in this type of movie, Oliver is the usually brooding bad guy, Dancy does well as the young artist. Of course its nothing really fancy, the romantic storyline is hokey but again typical and while its never great its at least acceptable fare. ** out of 4 stars.",1343001600,,1458,4.518939393939394

Viv doesn't work in some pastry shop, she goes to high school. Aiden doesn't choose her, she ends up with a member of the pack... this movie is so far from what it should have been I cannot believe that it was allowed to be released like this.",1331164800,,366,4.242857142857143
2793475,1,B000OCXLPU,"Only reason this movie would ever get above 1 star rating is if you have never ever read the book or intend to.

This is perfect example of how to butcher a good story and have someone make 'creative changes' that just don't work. This is the example I base all terrible versions of movies based on books on. Worse movie based on a book ever! Someone pretty much went ""Oh hey that sounds cool, let's take the idea and change everything.""
The setting (not even in the right country), the ages, the entire story to the point of ENDING differently. The ONLY thing the same is the characters names, the characters themselves are completely unrecognizable.

Blood and Chocolate is one of my favourite books. I didn't see this movie until years after it came out and I'm so happy I didn't. This movie is bad, I mean it puts bad movies to shame. Down-right don't waste your time. If you're a fan of the book I'm sure you would have heard of it by now, and if you haven't: There is a reason for that!",1331078400,,992,4.327956989247312

2793477,3,B000OCXLPU,"I was actually relieved there was no gore, but I was happy to see the film used real animals and not CG. Mostly, the dialogue was lame and cheesy. Probably something a group of high school seniors could have come up with - especially the ""age of hope"" line they kept repeating there at the end. There was little real suspense. I've never read the novel, so I have no clue how it did or didn't follow the book. So, I watched the film with no preconceived notions of what the story was about other than a pretty girl that was a werewolf. I think the film was good, but failed in the story line and the script. I would probably give it two stars, but there were some redeeming qualities. I find it refreshing that the two main characters did not (yes not) hit the sack. There are no heavy petting scenes. But, there is a booty and crotch grab in the beginning of the movie, which I found did not fit in with the style of the rest of the movie. It seemed to be put there to keep you watching. The rest of the movie was comprised of a few wolf chases, a few cutesy scenes between the romantic duo, and over all, less action than I've ever seen in what I thought was supposed to be a horror movie. Small on horror, small on suspense, terrible script, but decent acting. That's my take on it.",1319155200,,1285,4.164658634538153
2793478,4,B000OCXLPU,"I never read the book so I'm not jaded by that aspect.  This was a good movie!  It has drama (lots), romance and a very pretty cast. The special effects blow Twilight wolves out of the water.  If you are a paranormal fan than this is your movie.  Obviously you shouldn't read the book first.",1313193600,2,291,4.236363636363636
2793479,4,B000OCXLPU,"This is one of the better ""B"" movies I have ever seen.  As a werewolf movie, I found the approach to be unique.  A clan of werewolves resides in Romania, but there are rules which must be followed.  The clan only hunts as a pack ~ no solo hunting and / or using one's beastly talents for revenge against a human.  Violating these rules can lead to expulsion from the clan, or worse.

Agnes Bruckner is a perfect choice to play the lead role (Vivian).  While Vivian is a werewolf, she would much prefer to spend her days & nights making chocolate treats rather than hunting humans.  Indeed, she is actually repulsed by the bloodthirsty attributes of her clan.  Bruckner's austere eastern European beauty and athletic body make her an exceptional match for the portrayal of a female werewolf.

Naturally, Vivian encounters an American tourist named Aiden, and her dark secrets begin to slip outside of the wolf clan.

2793484,4,B000OCXLPU,"Teenage girl Vivian Gandillon (Agnes Bruckner) is a Romanian-American who's biggest secret is that she is a werewolf that belongs to a special race of werewolves who transform into full ledge wolves at anytime instead of the full moon as they are the possible source to the werewolf legends. She lost her parents years ago in Colorodo as she now lives in a Romanian city to work at her Aunt Astrid (Katja Riemann) at a local chocolate store. However, she falls in love with a visiting American man named Aiden (Hugh Dancy) who's a graphic novelist that falls for her yet doesn't realize her secret until murders start happening as the leader of the wolf race known as Gabriel (Olivier Martinez) with son Rafe (Bryan Dick) are on the verge to kill him so he doesn't reveal their secret yet Vivian must try to protect Aiden.

A lush, well made and original take on the werewolf lore! this supernatural horror-fantasy romance film is based on the popular cult novel by Annette Curtis Klause which i've never read but will soon. I love how the werewolves in this movie are actual animals than just the plain half-human half-wolf beasts you see in other movies or change during full moon, this one owes more to ""The Howling"" where the werewolves turn at anytime. The acting isn't bad at all although Bryan Dick as Rafe was a little over the top, but i do appreciate that this is a well made lycanthropic love story despite weak characterizations that should have cult potential.

This Blu-Ray shows off very nice picture in highest crystal quality and even wonderful sound. The extras are little such as deleted scenes and featurettes.

 I will say why I despise this movie very plainly, so even if you haven't read the book, you'll know what I mean. ""SPOILER WARNING!""
 In the book, our heroine, Vivian, loves being a werewolf and gets along with most of the other werewolves. The wolves only want to be left in peace, and are extremely careful not to hunt humans, while in the movie they're a sadistic lot who likes terrorizing and killing humans in a sick game where the whole pack hunts one person.
  In the book, Vivian's werewolf love interest, Gabriel, is a firm but very fair pack leader who wants a mate (and wife) for life. Gabriel does not force attention on Vivian, he very patiently waits to see if she'll become interested. He is in his early twenties, she in her late teens. In the movie, the pack leader picks a new mate every seven years (??) Gabriel is supposed to be forty-ish (to Vivian`s late teens/early twenties) , and is the father of Vivian's cousin. Her aunt is still in love with him. And he stalks Vivian and insists she can't do anything about her `destiny'. Uh, gross!!! Oh, and in the movie she SHOOTS and kills him - that DOESN'T happen in the book!!
  In the book, Vivian's human love interest doesn't except her for what she is - in the movie, he's totally cool about it.
  And...in the book, a certain character tries to murder Vivian - in the movie that persons her aunt, whom she lives with!!

 The movie is actually less scary than the book - I know, all those plot changes, and not more of a thriller? The movie is just occasional gore and violence - the book is really creepy and well-written.
  I think the worst thing about this movie was it's total lack of respect for the author's work, and the total inability of the movie-makers to realize that an original plot about being a teenager - longing for acceptance and true love, and being unsure - with an awesome supernatural plot that is just as strong as the characters, would be a way better, more popular movie than a not-so-thriller with clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;.

He especially shouldn't be allowed to ""have"" someone that doesn't even want him.  What I kept waiting for was for Vivian to actually defy Gabriel, tell him she wouldn't lay with him even if he forced her to be his mate.  But she stayed soo nervous, for no good reason.  And why did all those werewolves follow him anyway?  I mean if Gabriel wasn't soo intent on having things his way, none of the fighting would have happened.

First off, if you are going to be using parts of the book and not even follow the whole story, and change things that were in the book. Then don't call it ""Blood and Chocolate"". Just say that it's ""loosely"" based on the book, which in fact it is. I was so disappointed in this movie. I thought for sure it was going to be good, since when i was in high school i loved the book. But no, i was gravely disappointed in this Hollywood POS. Secondly, the book was for a young reader, like the Twilight series. Though an adult could read the Twilight series and Blood and Chocolate and still enjoy it. They cast actors that are in their late twenties to early thirties. Hell i think Olivier Martinez is around 40 or older. They needed a much younger cast. They decided to base the movie in another frigging country, when really it was based in the United States. They have Vivian work in a chocolate shop, when in the book she didn't. There are just so many flaws in that movie, its laughable. If you've never read the book Blood and Chocolate, then you might enjoy the movie. But don't watch the movie, then read the book, because you'll probably hate the movie afterward. This movie could have been so much better than what they did to it. If i was the author i would be embarressed to see this movie. Also when you name a book ""Blood and Chocolate"" and describe what the blood and chocolate stands for in the book, than the reader understands why you named it that way. When you decide to make it a movie, then don't name the movie ""Blood and Chocolate"" because even i, who read the book, is going to think a name like that is laughable, especially when you see the previews. If i filmed this movie, i would have tried to put in as much as i could from the book and i might have titled it ""Vivian"" since she is the main character in the book and the movie.

The movie producers made the decision to Not try to mirror the book. The movie is for an adult audience, whereas the book is slanted for young adults). It's an artistic movie with a straightforward plot, and with a glaring moral theme: everyone should be entitled to freedom of choice.

Vivian is put under pressure as the next-to-be-chosen by the Alpha male werewolf. She decides to be contrary, in wanting the freedom to marry whom she chooses. Besides the chosen locale, the European influence can also be seen by their fascination for Rave-style Discos. In one scene a crowd of twenty-somethings (many of them part of the werewolf clan) gather after-hours to socialize, network, drink, and dance.

""Blood and Chocolate"" is a very good movie and is suitable for most audiences, although many had horror expectations and simply couldn't tolerate a romance:) A lot of effort was put into the production, and the actors were capable.

The Blood and Chocolate Metaphor:

Blood and Chocolate signifies a metaphor for Werewolves and Humans. Aidan represents tasty chocolate (what Vivian wants), whereas Gabriel represents healthful blood (what Vivian needs).

The movie's director decided to DIFFER from the book, in that Vivian ultimately chooses Chocolate. (This is THE major irritant to the book vigilantes, who came out to comment in force:)

In the book: Gabriel is the alpha male who is responsible for leading the pack. He loves Vivian but she initially favors Aidan. HERE Vivian eventually concludes that Aidan is fleeting and non-essential - and therefore Blood is better than Chocolate.

In the movie: Vivian says ""I have the taste of blood AND chocolate in my mouth"". HERE Vivian eventually concludes that Gabriel is just too cold and domineering to be with - and therefore Chocolate is better than Blood. (It seems to be assumed that the audience would be curious and listen to the director's commentary, to divine the meaning of this single utterance).",1234051200,2,2218,4.975675675675675

I thought this will be great it would the #1 at the box office!  So I dragged my friends to see it on the opening date.

Fist thing I noticed was that for an opening date the theater was not very crowded.  I thought ""oh, well maybe people didn't understand the title.""  Less than half way threw the movie my mouth just hung open in disbelief!  It was an ABOMINATION!  They where butchering the it with their cheeze misinterpretation of the book and using horrible effects!  They didn't go from human straight into wolves in the flash of a bright effects light!

This whole movie missed the torment, feelings and stuggle Vivian was going through in the end of the book.  I highly suggest for people that have watched this movie to go read the BOOK!

2793563,1,B000OCXLPU,"I loved Annette Curtis Klaus's novel.  It did for werewolves in a smaller amount of time what Ann Rice's Vampire Chronicles series did for vampires:  Made them human and empathetic.

Klaus's story wasn't just one of people who became wolves at night and preyed on humans, but of the inner struggle their human part has with their animal part.  Vivian learns eventually that she cannot help being what she is and that it's not so bad with a good, strong leader like her father once was.

Here is a disgusting story about nothing but senseless bloodshed, bad special effects, and it leaves you cold once the end credits begin to roll.  There is no moral to the story about being true to yourself--just one long, cheap bloodbath that couldn't even begin to satisfy the most hardcore horror fans.

I don't even know WHY it was butchered so badly, as it certainly doesn't improve the story, which was fine as it was.  Agnes Bruckner is good in the role of Vivian, as are the actors who portray the Five; aside from Rafe's penchant for the occasional murder in the film, these six characters maintain their essence in the adaptation, though no other character does.  In the novel Gabriel is sexy, strong, and cool, not hateful and perverted.  He is not Rafe's father, and he does not switch mates every seven years.

2793565,4,B000OCXLPU,"First I'll say I haven't read the novel so I wasn't let down by it because it differed from the original story.  I've seen nearly every werewolf movie ever made from old black and white classics like the Wolfman or Henry Hull's  Werewolf of London to the first 7 of the Howling movies (some of which I couldn't believe I actually wasted the calories watching the thing), Dog Soldiers, Wolf, Beast of Bray Road, American Werewolf in London/Paris, and even Cursed and Gingersnaps along with countless others.

These werewolves were certainly a bit more fluffy on average than the lurking monsters in some of the other films, towering on two legs with dribbling saliva, wild eyes and 3 inch claws. Like the original Howling, they didn't change by the moon.  While some argue this takes away from the mythos, it also has the potential to put an edge on a movie.  At least if they only change under the full moon you don't have to worry about being ripped to shreds during the daylight. And how many movies have been made where it's glaringly obvious something is going to happen because people are taking a stroll (or making out... monsters hate people making out in their woods) under the full moon?  With a free transforming werewolf the danger is real and present at any time, any place, and you're never safe.

The second thing I applauded the movie for was the human being actually having a brain and a spine.  Particularly in recent vampire/werewolf genera it's too often reduced to Lois Lane and Superman syndrome.  The buff, cool good-monster type is the object of a human's love, and the supernatural character has to go charging to the rescue every two seconds.  In this movie, the romantic interest actually managed to look after himself.

The transformation sequences were also more fluffy, but since they weren't as savage or scary as many of the horror movies, I didn't mind.  I'd rather have seen that than a bunch of cheap and badly done CGI anyway (Bad Moon, anyone?)

I found it different enough to be refreshing, a bit sappy (wasn't overly fond of Underworld although I own both of those, too), and certainly not your standard horror flick.  That can be good or bad depending on how you look at it.  If you want fluffy wolves and a romance plot which happens to involve werewolves and a certain amount of peril, then it's not bad.  If you want a horror movie with plenty of splatter, definitely bury this one in the back yard.

As werewolf movies go, there's certainly a lot worse out there.",1213401600,2,2506,4.64625850340136

Since the rating was only PG13 i don't even know WHY they changed Vivians character...the only reason the book is even seen as somewhat controversial is becuase Vivian starts the book as a 15 year old girl that loves to think about sex (what young teenager doesnt?) to make this less of a BIG deal they changed her to a 20something chocolatier that doesnt even live in the US (again having nothing to do with the book, she is in HIGHSCHOOL in a southern state possibly Tennessee with all the moutnains). Overall, like i said if you had NEVER read the book you might be able to overlook most of the cornyness...otherwise be prepared to be dissapointed.",1208908800,,1229,4.442477876106195

Although it features the same characters, the movie entirely twisted the original story, killing off the wrong characters, taking place in the wrong locations, and even featuring the wrong conflicts. While in the book the title blood and chocolate reffers to the main character's internal conflict between being part of a pack and falling in love with a human, the movie uses it to refer to her job at a chocolate shop, hardly showing any of her interal struggle. And this is only one of the many key points of the story that was changed.
I guess this would be an okay movie if you haven't read the book, but even then I feel it lacking an interesting plot, or even characters that have good chemistry.
In my opinion, an overall disappointment.",1207353600,,917,4.530120481927711

Hollywood slaughtered the novel in every way shape and form. I haven't been this disappointed in a book turned movie since the Eragon movie came out.

2793581,3,B000OCXLPU,"This is a well done movie with a simple storyline based on Annette Curtis Klause's novel `Blood and Chocolate'. The title is a metaphor for Vivian's (the heroine) internal struggle between her werewolf heritage (the ""blood"") and her desire for a human boy (the ""chocolate"").

In this story, werewolves are still among us, happily living in Bucharest, where this story takes place. This is not the classical story of werewolves Hollywood has portrayed. Here, werewolves can change from human to wolf by the mere thought of it, whether it is a full moon or not, whether night or day. The change takes place in a glow of light, almost instantaneously. There is no metamorphosis into a monster between human form and wolf. Furthermore, those bitten by a werewolf do not become a werewolf. Upon their death, werewolves do not become vampires, as related in folklore. This movie therefore departs from traditional folklore. In this movie, werewolves are shown to be revered, not feared. Like in the classical stories though, they are susceptible to silver, and they do hunt humans.

There are no scary scenes in this movie like traditional werewolf movies. This is a love story, not a horror story.

Though stories of werewolves are folklore, there are people who actually believe they are werewolves (just like there are people who believe they are vampires). This psychiatric condition in which a person believes he is a wolf is called lycanthropy.

Is love possible between a werewolf and a human? Watch the movie to find the answer.",1205625600,,1530,4.96484375
2793582,2,B000OCXLPU,"As an adolescent, I loved Annette Curtis Klause's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-and-Chocolate/dp/0385734212/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood and Chocolate</a>, the gripping tale of a modern-day werewolf pack. In the film adaptation by Katja Von Garnier (screenplay by Christopher B. Landon and Ehren Kruger), Vivian (Agnes Bruckner) and her pack live in Bucharest, Romania after fleeing a massacre in the United States. The solitary Vivian jogs, works in a chocolate shop, and avoids the advances of her cousin Rafe and his slimy friends. At night, she sips absinthe in trendy basement clubs. One night she runs into graphic novelist Aiden (Hugh Dancy), who is working on a piece about the loup-garou (werewolves), and Aiden seems to speak her language, viewing werewolves as noble.

Vivian tries to shake Aiden's interest in her, as she is destined to become leader Gabriel's (Olivier Martinez) wife and future leader. However, the two eventually become involved, with tragic consequences for all involved. The so-called romance felt forced and unrealistic.

The film is very dark and violent, with several scenes of pack hunting, vigilante justice, and graphic murders. It seemed to be all style and no substance; sure, the location footage of Bucharest looked beautiful, but served no purpose to further the story. There was no integration with local culture, and the trendy clubs could have been in any major European city.

What little plot there was focused on vengeance, with shamefully little devoted to the werewolf lore that was the center of the original novel. In the film, there are no special effects when the humans (rarely) change into werewolves; instead, we're shown a brief blur that dissolves into real wolves. Disappointing to say the least; given, it's not a human in a bad werewolf suit, but none of the mystery or romance from the original novel is there. The chase scenes were heavy handed and overused, as were the numerous club scenes. The violence was gratuitous and largely without merit, but not scary enough to make this a horror film.

Other than the names of several characters, little has been preserved from the original novel, and that's a shame. Klause penned beautiful descriptions of the change from human to werewolf, and of Vivian's delight in her dual sensual natures. In the original novel, Vivian is wrapped up in school and the pack hierarchy, and in many ways is a normal teenager interested in art and music. In the film version, Vivian feels empty; we never know what she enjoys, we never see her at school or with friends. Instead of the well-outlined pack hierarchy in the novel, Olivier Martinez's Gabriel is focused on protecting the pack through violence; there is none of the code of honor featured in the novel, and the werewolves' code is much more animalistic here. In the novel, Klause makes it possible to sympathize with the pack members who have all suffered personal loss and tragedy because of what they are; here, we never meet (or care about) the faceless pack members that exist only to kill humans.

The DVD offers several deleted scenes, a commentary from Olivier Martinez, and widescreen and fullscreen versions.

Final verdict: next time, stick closer to the source material. Some changes may have given the story a fresh new face, but the screenwriters basically rewrote the entire Blood and Chocolate story without any of the romance or wonder.",1205366400,,3467,5.226618705035971

2793584,4,B000OCXLPU,"I found this film story to be one of the more interesting twists on the wolf legend but thought the films special effects to be less than first rate. I had no idea it was based on a book until I read reviews by dissapointed readers. Since I never read the book the film could scarcely have been a let down.  However, the book must have been grand indeed to have produced so many unhappy critics of this fine film.

I also think the idea of the element silver producing blood poisoning relative to normal wolf blood chemistry was also an original movie concept and another area in which gifted writers of modern horror movies can make this field always young, vibrant and wide open to original ideas.

I was dissapointed with the way this film presented humans morphing into wolves.  It was a good concept which was poorly done and as a screen visual effect just didn't do it for me. However, the basic film plot was fascinating and held my interest, despite what I think were poor visual effects. I rate the film as a four (actually three and a half) star experience and also agree with a previous writer that the characters were well established and portraid.

Blood & Chocolate is probably the only horror film I can recall in which the basic story and acting entertained me more than the special effects. Generally speaking special effects are routinely handled by competant technicians and special effects houses (e.g., ILM) than a typical plot in an average horror or sci-fi movie.  For my money the best horror and sci-fi films place an equal emphasis on both.",1203552000,2,1566,4.615107913669065
2793585,3,B000OCXLPU,"After centuries of being hunted by humans, a small family clan of werewolves - also known as loup garou - have settled undetected in their homeland of Romania where once they were revered but are now forced to hide in fear of extinction. They are passionate, feral creatures, but there are rules and traditions that, if broken, carry dire consequences. So when young, headstrong Vivian - promised to be their leader's next 'mate' - gets too close to a human boy who threatens to steer her from the path she's preordained to lead, she is forced to choose between her family heritage and the one she loves.

I first read BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE by Annette Curtis Clause years ago when I was a teen, and from my vague recollection of the story this movie didn't stay entirely true to the book and yet it didn't stray too terribly far either. It was actually a lot better than I thought it would be but, as usual, it was not as good as the book. I did, however, think the 'gathering hunt' scenes were really well shot, albeit in the book they stripped COMPLETELY naked, not partially so, but I guess they had to maintain that PG-13 rating.

Overall I found this film to be decent enough and definitely worth watching if you've read the book. If you haven't, though, don't go into this thinking it's gonna be bloody and violent just because it involves werewolves. It's not a horror movie and it was never meant to be.",1203206400,2,1409,4.5

2793605,5,B000OCXLPU,"I'm one of the rare fiends who enjoyed the movie far more than the book.

For starters, the characters are all much more interesting.  Vivian isn't a slutty werewolf, Aiden isn't a helpless, shallow human boy, and Astrid (particularly in one of the deleted scenes) is actually a likeable, even ADMIRABLE, aunt.  The only character I even liked in the book was Gabriel, but I found it hard to complain about his character in the movie--he was changed to suit the new atmosphere and other characters.  Plus there's something appealing about his dark persona.

In addition, the setting was just gorgeous.  It was dark where it needed to be, bright and sunny when it should have been.

And finally, the graphics.  The human-to-wolf sequences were beautifully executed.  Vivian being the white wolf was a tad cliche, but it set her apart from the rest of the pack.  Her fight with Gabriel, and the ensuing scene with Aiden, are my favorite scenes from the movie.

In short, the movie is highly underrated.  No, it doesn't follow the book, but it stands alone so well on its own.  Keep Klause's world out of your mind when viewing this movie, if you liked the book, and you'll find yourself enjoying the story a lot more.

Sure, the werewolf lore (with a refreshing twist) was there but it wasn't the heart of the movie, it was the doomed love affair between our heroine (whose destiny controls the fate of her blue-blooded werewolf line) and a mere mortal man.  The Romeo/Juliette overtones are what drives this movie and the werewolf storyline is a great way to retell the classic romantic story of two ill-fated lovers.  I won't go into details since enough are provided elsewhere.

2793624,2,B000OCXLPU,"Not sure if character changes count as spoilers, but just be forewarned, changes between the book and movie are noted and slightly picked.

When I first saw an ad for this movie, I was hoping that it would break the cycle of good book turned bad movie. I was sorely disappointed. This book shatters the original beauty of the novel. Gone was the metaphor for which the book was named. Gone was the tragic connection between two characters that made the book stand out. Instead, the beauty was replaced with a cliche ""boy meets girl and the two must overcome various obstacles"" storyline. I'm for love stories, but the one that was originally behind this book made it all that much more enjoyable.

If you're a fan of the book, don't watch this mess of a ""retelling"" (and I use that in the loosest of terms). Vivian is turned from the free spirit who, after struggling between that which she desires and who she knows she is and can be, embraces her true self into a girl who is just like every cheap movie ""pseudo-heroine"" who does what she can just to get the guy. Gabriel is turned from an arrogant, later understandable, leader into a b*st*rd*z*d version of some stereotypical dictator who's more capable of thinking with what's between his legs more than what's underneath his scalp.

The five and Astrid are pathetic. Gone are their set distinctions. Astrid is even Vivian's remaining family in this version. No longer is there the rivalry between Astrid and the Gandillion women. No longer is Astrid the jealousy driven wolf. Instead, she's a simpering fool who pines for Gabriel like a band groupie.

Simply put, if you want mindless entertainment, I'm not sure I would recommend this movie even then. Heck, the only reason I don't give this movie one star is because Agnes Bruckner makes for nice eye candy.",1185494400,5,1815,4.69811320754717

2793626,2,B000OCXLPU,"In the movie's official press release, ""Blood and Chocolate"" is described as a ""female version of `I Was a Teenage Werewolf,'"" although, in terms of its plot, the movie has nothing whatsoever to do with that 1957 camp classic, except that one of the screenwriters, Christopher Landon, is the son of the late Michael Landon, the star of that film.

Actually, a more accurate title for the movie might have been ""A Romanian/American Werewolf in Bucharest,"" since it's all about a freethinking 19-year old girl from the States who isn't exactly thrilled about her lycanthropic heritage (the ""chocolate"" of the title comes from the fact that she works at a small candy-making shop; the ""blood"" you can probably figure out for yourself).  Vivian (Agnes Bruckner) hails from a long line of werewolves who have gone into hiding in and around the city of Bucharest, fearful that if they make their presence known, the well-armed humans will hunt them down and exterminate them as they`ve done in the past.  As a child, Vivian's parents took her to live in America (which explains her lack of a Romanian accent), but when their true bestial natures were uncovered, the locals took matters into their own hands, killing her mother and father and burning their home.  Vivian, who barely escaped the incident with her life, now lives with the memory of the event, determined to keep her identity a secret and deny the beast within.  Complications arise when Vivian finds herself promised in ""marriage"" to the local lycanthrope leader (Olivier Martinez), while at the same time falling madly in love with a young, highly inquisitive artist from America (Hugh Dancy).  This makes ""Blood and Chocolate"" an interspecies version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" as well.  Heck, there`s even an ""A Boy Like That"" moment lifted straight out of ""West Side Story"" to certify the parallel.

Based on the book by Annette Curtis Klause, ""Blood and Chocolate"" is a stultifying tedious and boring movie that spends more time on musical montage sequences and darkly lit shots of people running through the forest than on generating thrills.  The film even cheats by having these ""werewolves"" turn completely into wolves, which, of course, keeps special effects and makeup costs down, although the kennel and dog-training bills must have been enormous.  The Bucharest setting is unusual and intriguing, but beyond that there is literally nothing worth recommending about this film.

As I recall, there were more genuine thrills in ""Teen Wolf"" - a movie that actually WAS ""inspired"" by ""Teenage Werewolf"" - than there are in this silliness.  And that was a comedy!",1185408000,2,2624,5.02073732718894
2793627,3,B000OCXLPU,"This movie is based on a young adult novel, (albeit with major changes to the plot) and if you're looking for a traditional, gory werewolf film, look no further.  This is in fact a Romeo and Juliet / West Side Story sort of film, the young man (Hugh Dancy) being the black sheep of his family, while his love interest (Agnes Bruckner) is a wolf in girl's clothing.  You don't get much more opposite than carnivore and meat, but attract they do, much to the dismay of her pack, especially the leader, Gabriel (Olivier Martinez).

In this film, werewolves in their human form jump around like crouching tigers and hidden dragons. They transform at will by leaping or twisting creatively through the air, emerging in lupine form from a blazing streak of luminous light.  The sight or smell of blood causes their pupils to glow with a weird yellowish tinge, and as you know, amber means ""caution"".

As Duran Duran might have sung in ""Hungry Like the Wolf"":

Sharpen the silver, light up a pyre
Wolves in the city, eyes are on fire
Do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
Aiden, he wants her, shows her a sign
But when he's bleeding it sends chills up her spine
Do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

Other than Bruckner, the acting isn't the best, even for a werewolf movie, and you'll find it's less like ""An American Werewolf in London"" and more like ""Teen Wolf"".

2793628,2,B000OCXLPU,I think they were riding their wave from Underworld which I really enjoyed.  Some of the special effects were good but there just wasn't much story and not much substance to what story there was.

2793629,5,B000OCXLPU,"I Just finished watching this movie and I came on Amazon to see how people liked it. I was shocked to see so many people saying this was a bad movie. It was far from it.

A lot of the People on here complained that it was so different from the book. Well Yeah most Movies are different from books, I mean just look at Harry Potter, their is so much information the movie's are missing that are in the books, but I have learned to take it as two different things. There is one the book series and two the Movie series. Very Few Movies have exactly everything from the books they are based on, hence the ""based on"" meaning that related but not entirely.

Other people mistook the title to mean literal ""blood"" and literal ""chocolate."" The Blood in the movies means the actual blood that runs through the loup garoux(werewolves) veins. The Chocolate is the temptation that Vivian has in the movie, in this case like most it's a man named Aiden.

Now the Movies Special Effects were awesome to watch and the storyline flowed, there was no missing info and everything was explained in the movie. (or at least everything that I noticed).

A lot of people also complained about there not being enough blood and gore in the movie. Yes there wasn't that much of that stuff, but it still does not make it a bad movie. It was quite enjoyable to just put in and watch.

If you've read the book learn to separate it from the movie. If you like super horror infused Movie this movie is NOT for you, however if you are like me, a normal movie goer, you'll enjoy this movie for what it is.",1184284800,5,1573,4.31864406779661

I found the film to be compelling, tasteful, and satisfying. I guess it just really depends on what kind of film you want to see- with this one, be open-minded and take the blue eyes and the white wolves and Ms. Bruckner for what they really are: beautiful!

When they say it is based on the book, that is what they mean, the idea for this movie came from the book.  They never said is was exactly the same.  Since I did not read the book before seeing this movie, I enjoyed it.  The idea of the werewolf in this movie is similar to Donna Boyd's books ""The Promise"" & ""The Passion"".  Where a human can turn into a werewolf @ will and the transformation is beautiful.  Why do movies have to be all about the blood & gore to get good ratings?  All this to say, I really enjoyed this movie, and I am hopeing for a sequel.",1184284800,7,647,4.047244094488189
2793632,5,B000OCXLPU,"I actually wanted to give B & C about just above a 4.5 rating, so I rounded up. Among all monster/creature movies this is one of the best. ""Big Bad Wolf, Dog Soldiers and The Howling"" are the three best Werewolf movies of all time. ""B & C"" ranks right up there at No. 1. I love the type of horror movie that concentrates more on the story, than the monster. Even though ""Dog Soldiers and BBW"" had excellent special effects, the use of regular wolves in this movie did not hurt ""B & C"" at all. The ""young lovers forbidden from being together"" angle, though done a thousand times, was beautiful. Hugh Dancy and Agnes Bruckner were perfect in their interpretation of Romeo and Juliet. Oliver Martinez, as the patriarch of the werewolf klan held a foboding presence whenever he appeared on screen. His charismatic ""enemy of the good guy/girl"" vs Hugh Dancy as the young hero was a perfect match. Martinez' evil did not antagonistically snatch at the audience.

Don't look for the 8ft werewolf that you find im almost all other werewolf movies. Lookfk for a great transition from human to wolf though as the body motions of the actors jell perfectly into the shinning light before they are transformed into regular wolves. The regular wolf look will also make one concentrate more on the stories that the wolves just happen to be a part of. Agnes Bruckner was good as a brooding, bordering on depressed ""waiting for the fire in her life"" werewolfet. Any more depressed though and she would have taken from the ""rescue me from my life please"" beauty waiting for her heroic beau. Their ""stay at arms length, I wish I had, I love you regardless"" romance was done to perfection.

Martinez's son(I do not know the name of the actor)was the perfect little menace, best described as ""a little snot"". His rebellious, no matter what, face was perfect and will get him many similar jobs in the future. It doesn't hurt that he is extremely talented as the ""leader of the ""Jr. wolf pack"". I do not know what Hollywood calls it, but the non-vivid colors of the entire movie and the perfect visuals of Romania added to the dread of a ""werewolf"" tale. This movie goes to show what I have always beleived; If you have a good horror-romance /slasher flick, you do not need all the blood,entrails and popping eyeballs. This story is not new, but the enjoyment is. I would recommend it, not just to werewolf fans,not just to horror fans, not just to slasher fans, but to all other movie fans. There was never a dull moment.

By the way, there are few movies that I would give a rating of ""5"": JAWS, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, JESUS OF NAZARETH, TITANIC, NAPOLEAN, BAND OF BROTHERS, CRIMSON TIDE, JAWS 2, FRIDAY THE 13th, HALLOWEEN, ALIENS 2, OLIVER, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, ARMAGGEDON, A.D. , THE MOMENT AFTER 2, A THIEF IN THE NIGHT",1184112000,4,2826,4.5810276679841895

2793646,3,B000OCXLPU,"BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE (a misnomer at best!) is another in the seemingly endless appetite-for-horror-flicks appeasers. Freely adapted from the Annette Curtis Klause's novel by screenwriters Ehren Kruger and Christopher Landon and directed by Katja von Garnier, this version of the loup-garou legend takes place in Bucharest, Romania and while the corps group of 'night creatures' carrying the mantle of the clan appears small, the group seems more updated in its views of survival in the world of 'normal man' than most: the werewolves are a normal appearing bunch who change into rather elegant wolves through computer generated magic in a manner that removes much of the gruesome element form the film.  It helps.

Loup-garou child Vivian (Agnes Bruckner) witnessed the death of her parents at the hands of men in Colorado and escaped to Bucharest where 10 years later she is the next in line to be the 'bride' of pack leader Gabriel (a gaunt appearing Olivier Martinez).  Her aunt Astrid (Katja Riemann) with whom she lives had been the first love of Gabriel and a tension is set early in the film about the plight of the pack versus the desire to be a normal human, a tension that will help the resolution of the film's love story.  The mysterious, questioning Vivian meets young artist Aiden (Hugh Dancy) who himself has escaped America and his own demons.  An obvious infatuation cum attraction occurs and though Vivian admits to warm feelings for Aiden, she knows her affair is doomed: her cousin Rafe (Bryan Dick) and his pack of five discover her tragic near crossover the line of human desire, and the crisis of the story proceeds along the lines of victim and pursuer.

The unfortunate title for the film is clumsily drawn from the negligently important job Vivian has working in a chocolate factory, hardly a comparison for the importance blood plays in the hunt and kill formula that the title supposedly represents.  But then it does set up the dichotomy of choice Vivian must make, whether to obey her loup-garou destiny or enter the realm of normal human motivations and desires. Yes, it all gets pretty corny, but in many ways this 'netherworld of monster types' film rises above others in its management of the transformation scenes (actually quite beautiful) and in the acting of Hugh Dancy. In the end it is the chance to see how truly Bucharest as a city really is that makes the movie worth watching.  The cast does the best it can with the weak material.

2793647,5,B000OCXLPU,"I watched this film with a modicum of hesitation because it is not really my genre. I was more than pleasantly surprised to enjoy what I consider the best cinematic offering for the year to date.  It is a beautiful combination of a ""Werewolf in London"", the ""Bourne Identity"" and ""Before Sunrise"", with Romania providing an exquisite location for what essentially is a very poignant love story, and very tastefully executed, with finesse and class and Romance.  The soundtrack is simply first rate, the acting is very capable, with the two very memorable and commanding leads, and the violence is the antithesis to gratuitous. An Avid and very astute reader stated that the film followed the book very well.  However, you need not have read the book in order to find this film a truly well done film, with virtually nothing lacking, with the exception of more special features.  As of late June, this is the best film of the year, in any genre.

2793650,3,B000OCXLPU,"Director Katja von Garnier directed ""Iron Jawed Angels,"" an HBO movie about suffragettes lobbying for the right to vote in the United States starring Hillary Swank that was excellent.  Her first film ""Bandits"" starred Katja Riemann who plays Astrid in ""Blood & Chocolate.""  This film has a great gothic look, but perhaps doesn't build dynamically enough to the final climax, although Aiden's chase sequence is excellent.

Ehren Kruger who wrote screenplays for the ""Ring"" movies & ""Brothers Grimm"" teams with Christopher Landon for this film.  The screenwriting is probably the MOST controversial aspect of the film.  We expect screenplays from books to sometimes telescope events, perhaps leaving out some scenes or even minor characters.  Annette Curtis Klause's book had a strong following.  So remaking Gabriel's character to have a darker aspect and eliminating Aiden's betrayal of Vivian radically changes the story, as does having Vivian's mother die and trying to blend all of her raising into Astrid's character.  Probably, it would be a good idea NOT to let Kruger work on the final Harry Potter screenplay because fans of the book go crazy with as much dramatic license as Kruger has taken with ""Blood & Chocolate.""

Agnes Bruckner plays Vivian Gandillon.  Bruckner was nominated for Best Actress in the Independent Spirit awards for ""Blue Car"" in 2003.  As Vivian, the audience never feels like they deeply identify with her.  We get a TV-quality performance of a girl falling in love who has the complication of a crazy family.  The fear factor and the seriousness of the consequences never play strongly.  Her performance has more romance than horror, when both were needed.  She looks very sweet as she works making chocolates.  One of the DVD deleted scenes that is chilling has to do with a boy who comes into the shop.  We think he's an ordinary customer until he casually comments that the ""hunt"" will be tonight.

Former boxer Oliver Martinez, who made a big impression in 2002 in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unfaithful-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00006RCNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unfaithful (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and was also in ""Taking Lives"" & ""S.W.A.T.,"" plays the dark brooding leader of the pack.  The film veers from the book where humans were not hunted to this limited-hunt version.  Kata Dobo makes a stunning visual appearance as the bloodthirsty redheaded vampire at the hunts.  One of the deleted scenes shows an unclad Martinez walking in the woods after he has switched back from his wolf form.  Making the audience not like Gabriel is one of the contradictions that is hard for even a good-looking actor like Martinez to satisfy.  How can you be charismatic enough to hold a pack together and romantic enough to earn Astrid's loving loyalty and also be a rather shallow jerk at the same time?  Whether this is actor, director or screenwriter, it doesn't play well.

Hugh Dancy plays the human artist Aiden Galvin.  Dancy has been in ""Black Hawk Down,"" played Galahad in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Arthur-The-Director-s-Cut-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0002YLCG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Arthur - The Director's Cut (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;& was nominated for an Emmy for his work in ""Elizabeth I.""  As the romantic lead, he probably is the most successful in the film.  Yes, he becomes fearful when faced with Vivian's blood sucking relatives, but he comes across as a very nice guy that the audience roots for to win Vivian's heart.

Bryan Dick's rooftop-hopping Rafe is pompous and repellant.  As events unfold, the audience cheers his fate.

Katja Riemann's Aunt Astrid is a complex nervous woman.  She is in love and losing love at the same time.  Riemann won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the Venice International Film Festival for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosenstrasse/dp/B0006IIKRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosenstrasse</a>, a film about marriages between Jews & non-Jews during World War II.  She is a nervous ball of energy in this movie, always moving in several directions at once.  It is an excellent performance.

""Blood & Chocolate"" works less well than its producers from ""Underworld"" might have hoped.  The story goes in too many directions at once.  It does have a great look.  There is enough here to warrant an evening's viewing, then go find the book.  Enjoy!",1182297600,3,4485,5.567208271787297

2793652,3,B000OCXLPU,"When I was in High school, I found Blood and Chocolate on the book shelf of the library and thought it had interesting name, so I read it.  I loved it, and didn't want to give it back to the library.  It was such an interesting and unique book, that I wanted it, and wound up getting my mom to buy it for me.

When I saw several years down the line that they were making a movie from it, I was so excited!  I wanted to see it in theaters, but wasn;t able to and just today I got it off of netflix and watched it with my husband.  I was very dissapointed in it, (though he liked it quite a bit more than I did).

Yes, it does give a nice new spin on werewolves, which I did enjoy.  But I started watching it expecting something a LOT closer to the story than this.  They turned a story of teenage angst and struggle for acceptance both of herself and with others, into a Hollywood cliche.

While the characters are similar, the movie is set in a totally different country than in the book, and Vivian lost her parents in the movie, while in the book, her mother plays an important role.  So many differences!  The only thing it appears is still the same in both the book and the movie, is that they are werewolves, Vivian falls in love with a human, and Gabriel wants her to be his mate.  A few other similarities do occur, though they are minor, and the changes in the story make these similarities hard to recognize.

I did enjoy the movie, don't get me wrong, and I would have loved it if I hadn;t read the book first.  The lack of gore and greusome tranformation was actually rather a nice change to me, but dangit, I wanted to see the fight for dominanace that is in the book, the passage that Vivian went through from girl to woman.  Her final acceptance of who she is, and the acceptance of the pack for who she is.  I wanted to see the book I love put to life.

After watching the movie, I went to find my old beat up copy of the book, only to see that I had lost it, so if some of my comparisons are inaccurate, please forgive me, but I do know for a fact that this movie was not the real Blood and Chocolate, just a very expensive knock-off.",1182038400,21,2150,4.068883610451306

2793654,3,B000OCXLPU,"Despite the somewhat soap opera-ish title of this film, I picked it up because it's from the creators of the Underworld films which were an excellent take on the vampire/werewolf genre and still some of my top favs to date.

First, B&C is being pushed as a werewolf film.  These are not the dark brooding monsters we were treated to in the Underworld films, but rather National Geographic wolves down on all fours with humans transformed into them just by jumping into the air and transforming into the wolf in a ball of light.

We meet Vivian, a troubled wolf girl outside the pack.  Her family was killed when she was a child.  She lives with an aunt who oogles over a fractured affair with the pack leader, who isn't really like a leader at all.  He's just some hot guy with sexy hair and a beard.  Vivian is distant to the pack and also distant to the movie viewer.  It's very hard to get to know her.

The pack is more of a shirtless boy band leaping off walls like acrobats.  The leader enforces certain rules upon the pack to keep them alive, including a carefully set-up hunt for a captive human running in the woods who can go free if they can reach the river.

Vivian breaks law by falling for a human, a graphic novel writing tourist who is researching werewolf folklore.  He tears up his train ticket to stay with Vivian and spend time with her.  Quite the sappy and clean teenage love affair of hand holding and running through fountains.

He kills Vivian's cousin (who is also the pack leader's son), almost by accident, who had been sent by the pack leader to force boyfriend to leave.  The hunt is soon on when the human boyfriend becomes the hunted as the pack leader wants to avenge the murder of his son.  We finally get to see Vivian as a wolf as she sets out to save her love.  Spoiler: The best scene in the movie is where he almost kills Vivian because he doesn't know it's her.

Still lost over the title of the movie?  I was too.  Vivian works in a chocolate shop, which isn't really important to the plot.  Her aunt mentions something of a quote about the taste of blood and chocolate in your mouth.  And that's about it.  The blood is minimal.  The love affair with Vivian and the tourist is quite innocent.  The tourist becoming a silver bullet commando in the end to save the day is a bit like your favorite daytime soap opera.  The ballet-like leaps through the air and flashes of light among the boy band pack turning into Jack London's wolves is a joke.

I kept thinking my teenage niece would probably just fall in love with this movie, and that's okay.  If it had come before the Underworld films, I probably would have enjoyed it more too.  It could probably be appreciated more if it had a different title.  More blood and gore (like Underworld) would have upped the premise and hype!  But that's not really what the film is about.  Actually, for those who love shows like Buffy, or 90210, or all those other teen dramas, this movie would have actually made an excellent TV nighttime drama.  So, you might like it.

So...overall...not bad, but not all that good either if you are like me and much prefer the dangerous werewolves that scare us to death, not the ones who fall in love with the boy next door.",1181606400,3,3242,4.402356902356902

She sees the beauty in being a werewolf and withdrawals from the more violent aspects, so since we are seeing the events mainly from her perspective, why is it unusual to see the beauty more than the violence?  Additionally, the film is much more of a love story with supernatural elements than a horror movie, which is not a bad thing, and it fits more with the overall feeling of the original novel.  Ultimately, I recommend the film, but if you have read the book, go into it by looking at the movie as a separate werewolf story.",1181606400,10,1157,4.308755760368664

2793659,4,B000OCXLPU,"I read the book and, while the storyline in the movie doesn't follow it at all, I still thought the movie was good. If you're one of those people who can read a book and then separate the movie from the book, you'll be okay watching this. It's making me angry to read reviews on here from people who refuse to watch the movie based on the previews they saw. Stop giving the movie a lower star rating. You haven't seen enough of the movie to actually know if it's good or bad.

The other thing that's upsetting me is the humongous ridicule aimed at the title of the movie. First of all, it's taken from the book itself. Second, just because Vivian works in a chocolate shop doesn't automatically mean that's why the movie was given the title ""BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE"". If you hadn't noticed, minus the gigantic plot change, the major part of the movie's storyline still revolves around what the book's entire plot was written about: Girl werewolf falls for human boy. Girl werewolf is torn between loyalty to wolf heritage and love for human boy. Blood. and. Chocolate. Huh. Go figure.

The movie isn't exactly mindless entertainment, like so many other people on here think. I actually found the plot to be executed nicely and the acting wasn't bad at all. Yes, the story centers around a love story, but the action mixes in quite well. The loup garoux/werewolf plot wasn't overdone to me. It felt refreshing. I was afraid that I'd see a complete remake of movies like UNDERWORLD or THE COVENANT, but not only did the story take something as old as a Romeo and Juliet plot and give it a revitalizing twist, it did it well and, as a whole, blended romance, action, and past storylines together almost perfectly.

Put simply, yes, this movie isn't going to get any Oscars, but it's still an okay, in-the-middle type of movie that you can easily watch and not want to keel over afterwards with disgust for the movie industry. Give it a chance.

The only qualms I actually have with it is whoever created the DVD cover. Ew.",1180569600,4,2015,4.542699724517906
2793660,4,B000OCXLPU,"I have read and loved the book Blood and Chocolate multiple times, and was prepared to be rather dissapointed with this movie, especially when the previews so obviously showed a movie that aside from a few names and the fact that there were werewolves was not the book at all. I wasn't wrong in that assumption. This movie however, although it was not a brilliant bit of oscar-worthy film, was still not horrible. It was a light, slightly chick flickish, but enjoyable movie. Don't go into it expecting the book, or a movie that is on par with Underworld and you can enjoy it for what it is.",1180483200,2,591,4.481481481481482
2793661,1,B000OCXLPU,I'm going to sum this up in a few sentences or less. If you have read the book by Annette Kurtis Klause and thought it was a fantastic read despite the fact that it is a young adult's book then I would strongly advise against seeing this movie. The story line pretty much went against everything that was in the book. Not to mention the fact that the special effects weren't all that great either. I loved the book and point blank period the movie was god awful. I wanted to cry within the first five minutes because it was just that bad. I guess that Ms. Klause cared more about what money could be made from the movie than the actual quality of the finished product.,1179705600,7,668,4.267716535433071

8184320,5,B000OCXLPU,"This DVD portrayed the Lycan world in a most beautiful way.  I could relate to the story line in so many ways.  The highlight for me was the exquisite  changes from man to wolf.  I loved the real wolf scenes depicting the grace and flowing movements of the wolf.  The photography was outstanding in my opinion.  The wolf like movements the actors portrayed gave me so much inspiration to try to move with their empowered grace that they learned in wolf camp. I see more with each viewing of this DVD as I repeatedly watch it.  It would be awesome to find another DVD that portrays the Lycan world with real wolves along with a story line that depicts life's ups, downs and sideways in as stunning a manner as Blood and Chocolate does.",1520985600,,734,4.432835820895522
