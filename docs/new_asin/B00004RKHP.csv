1344267,4,B00004RKHP,"To prevent any confusion, this movie is part 3 of Andreas Schnaas' Violent ... trilogy, which goes under the name of Zombie Doom, VS 3, and Infantry of Doom. All the same movie. I recently got the dvd of ""Zombie Doom"" which also has a bonus film ""Zombie 90"" on the disc. Both movies are pretty bad as horror or action movies go, but as splatter movies they are pretty good. Some versions are in German with subtitles, the Shock-o-Rama dvd has english dubbing (done by the same group that dubbed the Premutos dvd). This dubbing is laughably bad, you will either hate it or won't mind cause it adds even more humour to an already humorous splatter comedy. Make no mistake, this movie is not to be taken seriously, it was intended that way. If you don't have an open mind going in you're likely to hate it.
 The plot really has little to do with the first two in the series, although the 10 minute gang fight introduction of VS 2 loosely fits with the story of part 3. Karl the Butcher jr. (played well by Schnaas himself as usual) has rounded up a group of metal masked maniacs to rule over a desolate island. Their weaponry mainly consists of spears, machetes, and guns for the higher ranking warriors. The meister wields a shotgun. They brutally kill and conduct sick, gruesome experiments on anyone who invades their territory. When 3 lost travelers happen to become ship wrecked on the island, the stage is set for mayhem and bloody violence, Schnaas style. The men are captured and released to be hunted by the infantry as sport. They meet up with some former members of the clan and some kung fu masters but stupidly go out on their own. Not long after, they meet a nasty demise at the hands of the infantry. The martial artists decide to form a resistance and attempt to take revenge on Karl and his father. The following battle scenes are chaotic and graphic as you would expect, but before they can get their hands on ""the meister"" they must destroy a group of zombies, a troop of ninjas and dozens of soldiers! You'll have to see what happens for yourself, expect a smorgas board of gory killing and butchery.
 Schnaas has clearly been inspired by zombie, kung fu, horror, and action films and he throws it all at you. There's a little bit of everything, but the real highlights are the gore scenes. People, I ain't joking when I say there are some of the coolest gore scenes ever put to film here. And there are many of them. Heads are split open, bodies cut in half, limbs hacked off, eyes gouged, spines ripped out, etc. All in blood spraying detail!!!The most decapitations I've ever seen in one movie! The effects are considerably better than his previous films, on many occasions my jaw dropped. If you like Olaf Ittenbach's films you're gonna like this.
 The few negative aspects of Zombie Doom such as poor dubbing, stupid storyline and low budget props (the infantry's shields are garbage can lids) are easily forgiven when there's this much carnage taking place. This gorehound was well satisfied.
 Zombie 90 is the only extra, but it's a decent gore flick on it's own. With even worse dubbing, acting and plot you get the feeling that everything is just an excuse to throw buckets of blood and guts at the camera. Works for me. Fast forward the slow parts and you will be treated to a frenzy of outragous gore effects and no holds barred zombie madness. This one's a real bloodbath folks, right up there with Premutos although some of the effects are a bit second rate.",1035504000,9,3488,4.5493630573248405
1344268,2,B00004RKHP,"For starters, I don't know why this movie was called ""Zombie Doom"" as there were only three zombies in this movies who had a total screen time of 2 minutes... Whatever..Like most of these low budget romps, the movie makes little sense, which I am sure you could ascertain by the previous sentence.  I would really like to give the plot away in this review but there is nothing to give away.  The only thing I can do is tell you what I saw: three ninjas, a steel mask wearing cult, a disfigured leader(the Meister!), a Hitler wannabe mad scientist, three white guys that show up for no reason other than being killed in horrible ways, and some zombies.
There is alot of gory kills in this movie but they look so cartoonish you have no choice but to laugh at it.  The best thing about this movie, though is the hilarious dubbing.  All characters sound like they are talking in a cave, as there is some heavy reverb whenever they speak.  The dialogue itself is hilarious - I am willing to bet money that the words you hear being spoken in no way resembles the original dialog.
Get this movie if you love gore and get a kick out of the dubbing in any of those Saturday morning Kung-Fu flicks, otherwise, stay clear.",1029628800,7,1211,4.388392857142857
1344269,5,B00004RKHP,"this is the greatest movie ever. It has utmost realism. The fighting scenes are lighting fast. Ohh especially the milk bottles, or i mean grenades. This is a great movie. The zombies appear for AT LEAST FIVE MINUETS. Then the three german chinese guys fight ninjas in the forest. Get it. Its worth your 35 bucks.",1015545600,,312,4.589285714285714

1344271,5,B00004RKHP,"This zombie/splatter movie is awesome. Zombie Doom is one of the sickest and goriest movies I've ever seen. Best of all, it is uncut! It's a cheap movie, but the gore effects are well done for an amateur movie. I would recommend this movie only to splatter freaks who like movies with a thin plot and lots of violence.",994291200,,318,4.406779661016949
1344272,5,B00004RKHP,"This movie is great. Andy Schnaas is the man. It contains some of the sickest gore i've seen (and believe me, i'm a horror buff) Look out Tom Savini!  It contains just enough humor to make the gore SICK AND FUNNY!  I  give it 3 thumbs up!  Check out [...] for Andy's  latest flicks!",952992000,5,282,4.148148148148148
1344273,2,B00004RKHP,"The dubbing was so bad, I couldn't last through Zombie Doom without a headache, and Zombie 90, which is also featured on this DVD,  has even worse dubbing. I wish it was in subtitles, Germans speaking German would probably be better than...americans speaking american..ha!

one star for the FX and gore.

1344276,2,B00004RKHP,"Some people have the idea that this is the goriest movie ever. Well, its not... Not even close. If you are looking for real gore check out Peter Jackson's Dead Alive, Re-Animator, Verus, Premutos or anything by Takashi Miike. This movie looks like a home video and horribly dubbed. This movie is so bad it is funny which is the only reason I give it two stars. If you want a good gory film look elsewhere. If you have money to waste and have every other good gory film then check it out for the laughs. Just don't expect more than a home video full of red caro syrup.",1065484800,,567,4.2110091743119265

1344278,1,B00004RKHP,"this is the worst movie ever!!! it looks like it was filmed on someones motocross track. the acting.....what a sec, this isn't acting...this is a joke. i think they did the dubbing in someones bathroom with the lights out. i cant believe this was burned to a disc. im so glad i got it used. i pitched in the trash cause no one i know(or don't for that matter) should see this. folks, this movie is so bad that MST3K wouldnt touch it. i love zombie movies and this is a disgrace. like i said before.............WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!!",1058054400,5,531,4.428571428571429
1344279,5,B00004RKHP,"Apparently, some people actually enjoy watching a senseless movie that exists for no other reason than throwing as much blood and gore in the viewer's face as possible.  I know this because I am one of those people.  If ever a company lived up to its name, it is Reel Gore Productions.  I am in awe at the boldness and daring of director Andreas Schnaas; the man has taken his love of blood and gore to a height most of us sick, demented viewers have only dreamed about watching.  The special effects are not great and are even rather sadly fake on several occasions, but give the man his due: Schnaas threw just about every type of horrible death imaginable into this movie.  If you're squeamish, you might want to stop reading at this point.  Countless men are decapitated in a number of ways; throats are sliced open; fingers are chopped off; several folks are literally cut in two both horizontally and vertically; hands and feet are pushed completely through victims' chests and stomachs; men fall in bunches to the hot lead of machine guns, shotguns, and revolvers; hooks literally rip the skin from men's stomachs and one guy has his face peeled right off his head.  Oh, it's a beautiful thing.  I can't even tell you how many bodies this film leaves in its evil wake, but it has to be at least a hundred.  There's one scene that is so gruesome I can't even describe it in this review.
In case you are wondering about the plot, I can tell you the movie does actually have one-not much of one, but it has one.  These three loser guys arrive on a seemingly deserted island for no discernible reason and are quickly captured by an army of smelly, unbathed men wearing trash cans on their heads.  They belong to the Infantry of Doom, some kind of disturbing paramilitary group led by the Meister (who looks like Rob Zombie will look in about two hundred years) and his son Karl (or Meister Junior).  Andreas Schnaas plays the part of Karl, and he makes the movie come alive as the only character who really seems to care about what he is doing.  Anyway, our three unlucky losers are forced to watch the Meister discipline his troops (and it ain't pretty), then two of them are sent off with a camp rebel to serve as the prey to be hunted  by the evil undead minions of  the Meister's personal mad scientist, Dr. Serius.  Serius is creating zombified soldiers to be used for the extermination of mankind, and you can tell he's not playing for the good guys by the fake little Hitler mustache he wears.  More people die, some ninjas show up, and you get the mother of all fight scenes at the end.
Zombie Doom is actually the third movie in a trilogy whose name I can't name here (although the editorial reviewer can and does), but it doesn't matter if you've seen the first two movies or not.  The only ticket you need for this gorefest is a love of extreme horror.  Make sure this is what you really want to see before you watch it; this isn't the type of gore you will find at your local cinema, so be prepared for extreme acts of human evisceration.  This movie drew a few oooh's out of me, and this ain't my first gory rodeo.  I loved this movie.  I don't care how stupid it is, nor do I care that it's a German film with the worst English dubbing known to man.  Zombie Doom gets a very bloody five stars from this reviewer.",1050537600,23,3329,4.394779771615008
1344280,4,B00004RKHP,"Andreas Shchnaas is responsible for this trashy low budget gorefest. VS1 however was shot on a camcorder so i can't complain of the quality. The violence is extremely vile and includes scenes of graphic torture, dismemberments, disembowelments, and numerous other perversions us gorefans kill for. If bloody guts and gore drenched fun is your cup of tea, then this one'll have you dry ... your vcr for more.  One scene is when the dr. is torturing his patient and he plays around with the intestines, which make a very rude farting noise, and then he snaps his leg in half. My mom broke the dvd in half half way through, but then again, she doesnt know i have the Violent Sh! t trilogy on dvd and that vs3 is the same(only a little more uncut).  There are many sick things here, including a scene... where... well... heh, let's just say Schnaas spins an ASSRIPPING good yarn. Get it. its worth the money.",1047513600,,904,4.574074074074074

1344282,5,B00004RKHP,"I just watched Zombie Doom, and laughed through most of this movie. The dialog would make Ed Wood look like an academy award winning writer! The dubbing must of been done by a third rate moron. If you're into cult movies with idiotic dialog, lame brained story line, and terrible acting then this flick is your choice. I enjoyed the cheesy FX with all of the head lobbing and copious amounts of ""blood"" which looked more like paint. I've seen some really bad Eurotrash before, but Zombie Doom has got to be worst, nevertheless the nonstop unintentional humor is worth the price!!",1042243200,2,579,4.686274509803922
7921398,3,B00004RKHP,"Zombie Doom, the third Violent S*** film, is a mixed bag of micro budget proportions. I give it three stars because of some of the violence and gore ranged from being great, to others being not so good. Its very quirky, with it's comedy aspects, and kung fu film influences. The dubbing is so bad, that I find it to be distracting. It was dubbed a lot worse than the usual european and asian releases. I do feel that if I had watched the film in the original language with subs I would have rated it higher. Some of the scenes are really violent, that I feel your casual horror goer would have a hard time watching. Also fans of big budget horror films, will also not give the film a fair review. This flick is for splatter fans only. If you are a fan of SOV 80s and 90s horror, and don't mind set pieces and camera work not being top notch, than this film would sit nicely in your collection. Note: The Zombie Doom title is misleading, as there are not many zombies in this movie at all. I think the original title was ""infantry of doom"" which I think suits the film much better.",1488412800,,1080,4.222222222222222
7921399,3,B00004RKHP,"Zombie Doom aka  Violent Sh*t III is strange for various reasons
This is the only installment of Violent Sh*t in North America
Do you need to see the previous two films absolutely not
At first you'll notice this strange look to the film!
It was shot on video (during the VHS boom it wouldn't be a big deal) but, on dvd you can tell something is off
One major positive of it being shot this way sometimes you could swear some of the footage was a snuff film which adds this strange organic realism to the feel  Not horrible by an means.... I've seen much work
The american language dub will make you wanna tear out your hair, The dubbing is horrid
The gore is a mixed bag (it's really easy to tear into this film and be overly critical) But, i honestly can't you can tell  director Andreas Schnaas put his blood, sweet, and tears into making this
Anybody can say it sucks and the same old internet keyboard warrior nonsense to those I'd like to see you do any better

If you are a die hard European horror fan it's a interesting film to see at least once
Andreas Schnaas does a hell of a lot with very little you gotta Respect him for that alone  7/10
The Shock-O-Rama dvd comes with a bonus Andreas Schnaas's  Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence

It's very entertaining, it's very gory (and the effects are awesome!), the acting is hilariously bad, the dubbing is *beep* hilarious, but the movie is not only unintentionally funny, it also has a couple of intentionally funny moments like the part when the 3 main characters fight against ninja zombies... The people that don't like this movie have no sense of humor!

I give it 5/5 and no, that's not too much. This movie shouldn't be taken seriously. If you think that this movie is *beep* because of the acting, the dubbing, the directing, the editing, etc... Then you're pretty stupid because those things aren't important at all in low budget gory movies.",1232928000,,750,4.769230769230769
7921402,5,B00004RKHP,"this dvd of zombie doom also features another movie by the same director called zombie 90. i'm going to reveiw both.

zombie doom 5/5- zombie doom is about a cult of killers who live on an island. the basic story goes like this. 3 friends end up stranded on the island. they get killed. some asian, kung fu guys who were banished from the cult get revenge on the cult and its masters. theres also some ninjas and zombies. i won't go any deeper than that. zombie doom isn't trying to be original or oscar winning. its just an entertaining, gory action/horror film. the film really isn't as gory as its said to be. theres still plenty of gore, but its mostly decapitations and blood squirting. the special effects are pretty good for a low budget film. the zombie make up is cool and the gore scenes are over the top and graphic. there are also some ninjas which is always cool and the end scene where the asians attack the camp is filled with explosions and action. if your a fan of b movies, zombies, kung fu and gore then pick this up and enjoy.

zombie 90 4/5- zombie 90 is the bonus film on the dvd. the plot is one of the most un-original ever. a plane carrying a chemical crashes and people become zombies. this movie iosnt as good as zombie doom. its probably one of the worst films ive ever seen. the editing is BAD, the dubbing is ridiculous, like some teenager high on shrooms trying to be funny and the special effects are extremely cheap. even though the special effects are fake looking, gore hounds like me will enjoy how graphic and disgusting they look and trusat me the gore in this movie is graphic. a baby is torn to peices, theres about a dozen decapitations, tons of gut munching and even some sexual mutilation in the form of a breast being cut off and a woman being cut open at her vagina. all of these scenes feature kill bill style blood spray. the films goreiest scene is when a tour group is attacked by the living dead. the group is killed and eaten in graphic, un flinching detail and the scene lasts for like 7 minutes. while zombie 90 is gory, its also very badly made.

overall, zombie doom is a great buy. you get 2 very gory films for the price of 1. go buy it if it sounds good.",1180742400,,2212,4.299760191846523

Otherwise, it's still a good gore and splatter flick.  It's a combination of Dead Alive (aka Brain Dead), the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and a bad kung fu movie.  Some of the execution scenes are worthy of Saddam Hussein or Torquemada. For this one, I recommend something at least 80 proof, such as Jim Beam Black.",1169164800,,459,4.6419753086419755

Second of all: EW!

Third of all: The ninjas are the ONE reason this movie gets a star.

It starts out as three guys arrive on this island where a psychopathic maniac has this cultish like religion, which involves a LOT of torture and death. In his religion group thing he has this insane doctor that likes to work on brains...

Oh, have I given the plot away?

This movie has more gore in it that I've ever seen in my life. If you thought movies from the 80's were bloodiest, you were wrong.

And most of it was completely senseless and looked incredibly fake.

Zombies had THE most minor role in this movie and seriously, ""Zombie Doom"" was the wrong name for this movie.

Most of the music was bad, and I know, I DO soundtracks for movies. The music needs to somewhat go with the movie!

And seriously! The amount of skin showed on the psycho leader guy is scary enough!

The only thing that saved this movie from being a total waste had to be the ninjas.

I won't tell you how awful the acting was either.  What I will say is this.  This movie has a grain of genius rarely seen these days.  I've seen plenty of movies that are so bad they're good.  I happen to think that the phrase has become cliche', but its true.  I've seen movies that should have been good, could have been good, but just weren't.  I've seen movies that were so bad they made you violently ill. (Anything by Uwe Boll...and not because the gore was realistic but because you feel sick that you've wasted precious hours of your life watching his crap)And I've seen movies that I forget 10 minutes later.  Zombie Doom is definatly not the last one...but a bizzare combination of all the rest.  The story, the setting, the acting, the dubbing, and the complete lack of sense in this film contribute to the reasons not to watch it.  The splatter effects are quite good though.  Now here's the thing... Take any of the faults I listed in this film, on its own, and you have a reason to pass on Zombie Doom.  But because of ALL these faults I think it may be your duty as a member of the human race to see this monstrousity.  Inexplicable ninjas...(Played by Asian actors with no apparent martial arts or even gymnastic skills), the death of the principle characters mid way through the film, and the lack of exposition where its needed combined with the exposition you don't need.
