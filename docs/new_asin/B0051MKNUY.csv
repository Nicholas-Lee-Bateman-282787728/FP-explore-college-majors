4523461,5,B0051MKNUY,"This is such an incredibly tough workout!  Bob starts off a bit easy with deadlifts and twists so you may be thinking this will be easy.  Think again!  He keeps kicking it up a notch, and you'll be drenched in sweat in no time.  Bob says at the end that you'll be cursing him the next morning when you wake up with a sore core.  Well, I won't have to wait until the morning....my core was feeling it right away. I thought Jillian Michaels' 6 Week 6 Pack was tough, but this workout puts that one to shame. Bob's workout is slow and controlled compared to the rush of Jillian's workout. If you're looking for a way to really get ripped abs, I highly recommend trying this workout.",1313366400,46,679,4.2734375
4523462,5,B0051MKNUY,"I loved this workout! This is a tough 50 minute workout that works your entire body. The next day my entire abs, back, and arms were so sore!

4523463,5,B0051MKNUY,"I have two other Bob DVDs -(Inside Out Cardio and Extreme Weight Loss) so I had an inkling that this would be equally tough and I was not disappointed. I was, however, drenched in sweat and thoroughly wiped out by the end of the 50 minute segment. The 10-minute ""quickie"" is no cupcake either. I plan to use this to supplement my normal routine of cardio/Pilates/weights and hopefully as time goes by I will find this a little easier. Word of caution: if you have any type of knee and/or back issues you may want to modify a couple of the moves, particularly the side burpee and the aptly-named Killer Side Plank Twist. If you want a challenging workout for the core then this is your huckleberry!",1312761600,48,697,4.496062992125984
4523464,4,B0051MKNUY,Bob delivers a very grueling workout...It has you sweating all the way through. The only area that seems to be toned down or simplified is the plank work. It is hard to follow and the rolling sit up and jump sections were next to impossible. Perhaps Bob could have included a variation for those who cannot drop roll and jump. Looking forward to seeing some abs underneath layers of having 3 boys in the last six years.,1312329600,9,419,4.454545454545454

4523477,5,B0051MKNUY,"Great core workout! Bob Harper always works you hard, no doubt there. I've come to ""dread"" doing most of his workouts because they are just going to hurt at some point! But, in a good way. You're not wasting your time if you're doing one of his workouts. This core workout is no exception. I also like that it's just under an hour, which works good for a busy morning or a bonus after-work routine. Some of the moves are tough, but for a good reason, they definitely work! I've noticed improvement in just 3 weeks in my core strength. I highly recommend this workout.",1470614400,,567,4.40952380952381

4523492,5,B0051MKNUY,Bob Harper never fails to produce a great product. I can definitely feel my core tightening up after the first week. I regularly work  my core but wanted to step it up a bit. I was sore after each workout for the first week. My clothes are a little looser. I recommend this  workout.,1433289600,,283,4.222222222222222

Super challenging for beginner to intermediate. I bought as many Bob Harper workout DVDs as I could find. He gives clear instruction. Easy to follow, but not easy to do. You will sweat and find some of this very challenging. Very pleased.",1433030400,,379,4.846153846153846

4523495,5,B0051MKNUY,"I hate to say this...but this beats Jillian's Killer abs DVD....and that's a lot for me to say, because usually, Jillian is my favorite above all. But I have to say, the Killer abs lacked a bit of intensity for me (except level 3, but I'm not getting in to that). Anyways, I got this one because I saw it on here and I have never seen it in the stores before. My core is my problem area, all the fat seems to accumulate there. I guess because of my body type. But I tried this for the first time about two weeks ago, and I LOVE it. I feel my abs ACTUALLY WORKING. I mean, you can tell you are getting stronger. My stomach is nicer since I workout now, but I'm hoping this DVD will help me drive it all the way home...giving me a complete toned tummy. The workout is fun, Bob goes at a nice pace and it's intense. Lots of balance for your core, and not a whole lot of basic crunching. The only time you will be on your back with crunches is like the last 10 minutes of the workout. Not for beginners, but definitely something to work up towards. The ONLY thing that is annoying about this workout is the guy working out in the background. He seems to have pretty terrible form while doing a lot of the moves, like he is always slouched down and it's kind of annoying because he needs to be doing it right like the other girls since it's an instructional workout DVD. But really, that's just me getting down into little silly detail. I wouldn't worry about it. :P It's just me because I get distracted by things like that easily. XD But would I HIGHLY recommend this to strengthen your core!",1430697600,3,1589,4.17915309446254

4523520,5,B0051MKNUY,This video definitely focuses on the core with a mix of cardio moves and should be integrated with anyone doing physical activity. This is a less intense option than his other videos but still a sweat inducing workout. I have noticed that my entire midsection had firmed up over time. Anyone with spinal issues should talk to their doctor first as with any video but this particular video will require control ( do not throw your body around).,1401148800,2,443,4.6923076923076925
4523521,4,B0051MKNUY,"I've been slim/skinny all my life except for my spare tire, muffin top, speed bump, you name it. If you think skinny women have flat tummies, think again.  Instead of the fat accumulating in other (in desperate need of some cushion - like my derriere, calves, and shoulders), it prefers to set up camp in my abdomen. Set up camp and procreate like bunnies. Now that I've hit my 30s, my metabolism has slowed, which just made it worse. Since I can't spot reduce or crunch my way to a flatter abdomen, I have to force my body to use up the stored fat.

I've been on a healthy diet for three months and now I can finally say that I can see a hint of my oblique muscles. This DVD is in my rotation and Bob really makes you feel it. Even though you don't do a lot of running around, you end up sweating profusely and your heart rate is up which equals to fat melting off your body. He incorporates exercises that targets the core, in addition to a few cardio such as Side Burpees *groan.* (Don't get me started on the Russian Squat Kicks.) I can't tell you how many times I went into child pose or hugged my knees into my chest ( I pause the DVD - I feel super guilty whenever I do it) because my abdominal muscles ached. After this workout, I feel depleted and cannot pop in another video. It's that challenging. Seeing poor Angel suffer alongside me makes me feel a tad bit better. This person is supposed to be fitter than me and he has poor form in some of the exercises. Maintaining proper form in this video is hard and challenging, such as the Single Side Leg Raise. Working the core requires balance and focus, which I'd like to say that I'm on my way to getting better.

Equipment needed: dumbbells. I use 5 pounds.

There's a modified version. The girl doesn't use any weights, but honestly the modified version isn't as easy as Jillian's modified versions or even classify it as for beginners. The fit girl struggles (without any exaggeration) to get through it.

Overall, recommended.

Be prepared to thank (or curse) Bob the next morning when you wake up with sore abs (knowing that you got a killer workout).",1399420800,3,2117,4.374045801526718

4523523,3,B0051MKNUY,"I workout six days a week and also do lots core workouts regularly and do weekly 30 minute core classes etc. I did this DVD a few times and the first time I did it, my abs didn't hurt but my lower back (also part of the core of course) and hamstrings killed for a couple of days after. I did it the following week and they just hurt a bit. However, the third time I did it I used a slightly heavier weight (3kg dumbbells) and I strained my lower back and gluteal muscle. I can only assume it was doing the single leg deadlifts and I must have pulled a muscle then. I didn't notice the pain until the next day. i couldn't do any exercise for about 10 days and even over two weeks later my flexibility still isn't great and I have to be careful! I am 30 years old and have exercised for years and I have only ever had shin splints so this was frustrating. I know that straight leg deadlifts take years to master properly but just be careful not to round your back during and don't lift heavy weights, particularly for the single leg deadlift exercise like I did! Overall, it's OK and quite innovative but just be careful!",1395792000,2,1119,4.161290322580645
4523524,4,B0051MKNUY,"If you want a little something to help define your abs, this will definitely help.  I use this as a supplemental workout every once and a while to change things up.

4523525,4,B0051MKNUY,"I like Bob more than Jillian. When she talks about fitting in to skinny jeans and so on I find it a little demoralizing. Some people like having their butts kicked a little when they are out of shape. Others, including me, find it demoralizing. Bob does not do that, he's not really in to fat or health shaming. There isn't much small talk and he mostly talks about the exercises. I personally find his demeanor kind of calming and it helps me focus. If you are a person who likes to get ""revved up"" you might like Jillian more. I like that he methodically explains all the exercises so that you can have proper form while doing them. When I got used to them I just sped up the pace a little.
I'm ""skinny fat"" so I just did the 10 minute bonus workout after my regular cardio for a few weeks before doing the regular 40 minute workout. This tape is customizable. As you build up your strength you can just use heavier weights ( most of the exercises incorporate them).
So if you are a not totally in shape person who wants a DVD that won't make you feel down about yourself and that you can customize as you build strength this is the one for you. His emphasis on proper form is very good if you are not in shape or used to exercising and do not want to hurt the next day. When you get in better shape just combine both workouts for a full hour and use heavier weights. This is a pretty tough workout if you do that.",1392940800,2,1416,4.152727272727272

More like a 40-45 minute workout.  The rolling exercises (where you go from standing to rolling on your back and up again) are hard to perform on hardwood floors if you are using a yoga mat.  Maybe if you have a thicker one it is OK but I have been doing crunches through these parts.

4523546,4,B0051MKNUY,"The beginning of this exercise dvd starts slow and you are completely acing the moves, thinking you are quite good at this, then you move from dead lifts, weighted squats and wind mills to plyometric squats, side planks, a side burpee, roll backs, Russian squat kicks and several other moves that don't make you feel quite so superior any more.  I exercise daily, and don't gravitate to these types of workouts overall as my first choice, but when I want something different, I know that Bob will work you till you are dripping sweat.  Yep, he does so again.  The moves are not difficult per se (well, I couldn't do the roll back, but maybe that just takes practice), but they are very targeted.  I DID feel it, starting later that day and into the next couple days, so Bob definitely can put a plan together.

The main work out is about 48 minutes and has a timer at the bottom of the screen.  I like seeing the time go down to zero and also it shows the name of the exercise you are currently doing.

The 12 minute bonus workout consists mainly of windmills, sumo squats, weighted side bends and leg lifts.  Perfect to add on to another workout or if you only have a couple minutes to concentrate on your abs that day.

I have decided not to purchase just because my enjoyment factor is kind of low for these types of workouts, but will borrow again from the library now and again when the mood strikes.  If you are a fan of Bob Harper, you probably enjoy his style and I would say add it to your collection.  It definitely delivers on the promise to work those abs!",1373673600,2,1568,4.353951890034364

4523552,2,B0051MKNUY,"This is a good ab workout (one of the few to make my abs sore!), but his warm-up goes completely against modern warm-up ideas, using static stretches before going straight into the workout. I was surprised by that, seeing as he's on the Biggest Loser (though I've never watched it) and his co-host Jillian Michaels has excellent workout DVDs.

Only one of his assistants (the one who does the 'easy' modifications, without weights) has good form...the rest of his trainees definitely struggle in this area! It's nice to see other people struggling with a workout, but if I'm expected to follow their form, I want to make sure I'm following good form!

Some of the moves are really good. 40 minutes is a looooong ab workout, and I've only made it through the whole thing once (and couldn't laugh for several days!). The short workout is not even worth your time. I'd say IF you get this DVD, be sure you're familiar with proper form and be free to skip around the moves to create a workout that suits you and your time.",1365638400,10,1018,4.557377049180328

I received the video and watched it a few days prior to actually doing the workout (I do this for workout videos... I want to know what I'm getting myself into!).  The workout looked easy enough when I watched it through.

When I actually did the workout, it seemed harder than it looked.  I used 8 lb weights which is 4 lbs lighter than I typically use at boot camp, but they did the trick with this video.  I don't really feel like I worked my core enough, or with the intensity I was hoping for.  My abs were not even slightly sore this morning.  My hamstrings, however, were very sore this morning which I thought was odd.

I also couldn't figure out how those folks could do those ""Roll ups"".  I'm not a big person at all, but I couldn't do them correctly.  Maybe I'm just too uncoordinated or didn't get enough momentum going?! I did weighted squats instead during those roll up sets.

Overall, I'm not too impressed with this video.  I was expecting not to be able to move this morning, but instead, my core doesn't feel like it got a work out yesterday. I'll end up keeping it because it wasn't expensive.  I will probably just use this for light workout days.",1363046400,2,1411,4.397683397683398

I did find certain moves, such as the ""roll back"" to be difficult. I got down fine, did the butt lift movement, however getting up is something that I find to be extremely difficult. Even though I am slightly slower than the people on the video, I do try my hardest and I imagine that I may someday be able to do the move with those on the dvd.

My core feels great after doing this workout.  Some of the moves they want you to use a dumbell weight with.

I must say though that Bob is a little cheesy in his dvd's with some of the things he says.  I have exercised to many of Bob's, Jillian Michael's, and Billy Blanks Tae Bo dvd's, and Jillian Michaels is by far my favorite trainer.

4523591,4,B0051MKNUY,"This DVD workout, and his style is for people who are advanced in fitness, know good form, and safety with weights.  This is not for beginners, since he himself even uses very POOR form while doing these VERY tough exercises.  He uses weights with very difficult movements, does not explain what good form should be, does not have the models demonstrate good form, their toes are way over their knees, backs are arched, not straight, etc....

His plank is like a downward dog!!  I was seriously surprised that his form was so bad, and that he allowed the models to use incorrect form and posture while doing the exercises!!  Very disappointed.

The workout is GREAT if you are very knowledgeable about proper form and posture, and can use heavy weights with difficult movements while being safe and using good form.  I can't stress this enough.  He does not protect new people from injuries or getting into very bad habits. IF a beginner were to do this , they would get very bad posture habits, and most likely hurt themselves.",1354838400,,1028,4.70391061452514

Even though I'm in great shape now, this workout really makes me work! I am sore the next day through my core and legs. The thing I love about this DVD is that it includes cardio to burn calories as well as strengthening your muscles, and there are very few actual ""crunches"" involved in this ab workout. Since I have diastasis recti (separation of the abdominal muscles due to pregnancy), crunches are not recommended for me as it can make the condition worse.

4523597,5,B0051MKNUY,"Bob is incredible.  I have done a ton of Jillian Michaels' videos in the past year and have found them to be effective in helping tighten, I've gotten a little definition in my abs but find her videos to focus too much on burning calories (cardio) and they lack the intensive focus I think needed to really carve out some nice toning & definition in the abs.  Personally, I don't store my body fat in my abdomen (cursed upper thighs!!) So I don't know why I'm not getting better results.  I'm 5'10"" and 120 lbs so its not that I've got a thick layer of fat hiding the muscle.  So with these solid workouts 4-6 days per week, eating a high-protein, low fat diet, drinking water, etc.  What gives?

That said...after recently tapping into the resource that is Bob Harper, I'm thinking those results are coming my way.  His workouts are longer and more focused at around 1 hour of solid, quality excercises with little rest time.  It pushes me to limits I didn't know I had, it is intense but the Bob's pacing, direction and style works you through it methodically.

I'd call myself a beginner/intermediate.  Many of the moves in the tougher section I can't do at all! Like the roll backs - getting down is hard enough but then there's no getting back up! So the second time they came around I stayed on the floor and did some Pilates rolling-like-a-ball moves.  Then the side burpees!! What!?
One thing overall that makes it harder for me is not just the stress on the core but with so many planks etc my wrists really hurt - also my shoulders.  My upper body strength is really lacking so I'm getting as much of a work out there as my core.  I will probably only do this work out once, at the most, twice a week and I look forward to feeling stronger and stronger.  The 10 mins bonus is really my level and I might incorporate that almost every day after another work out.",1346457600,,1066,4.216748768472907

I started back using the mini-workout for about a month and only today did the full workout again.  (I should say that I got your about 70% of the full workout!  It's going to be a while to work-up to the full thing again).  I'm 61 and would generally think this exercise program is better suited for those a bit younger than me but then, I've always liked a challenge and this has been one for me.

I have an old shoulder injury and injury to my Bicep tendon, so I have to be careful when I do plank holds, push up's, etc. I aggravated my bicep tendon a ""tad"" when I did this workout and had to rest/ice it. It's a chronic problem, so I wouldn't completely fault the workout for aggravating my shoulder. I need to be extra careful with my form and the amount of weight I use for core work with this video.

There is plenty of lower back and oblique work (PLENTY!!!) but the crunch series was at the end of the workout and for only 8-9 minutes...yes, I am nitpicking...but that's what a review is for!!

By the next day? You'll feel it.  Two days out?  You'll be swearing at Bob with step you take, and encouraged to complete the DVD again.

Others have summarized what exercises are in this DVD, so I won't.  I will say that I am generally bored and not a fan of workout DVDs, but I don't have this problem with Totally Ripped Core.  I *want* to do it again,  because it makes me focus on my core and Bob's workouts are highly effective.

I do wish that the DVD included an alternative to the Rollback Series, as I am not able to do a complete return to standing, especially not in the time allotted.  I will keep trying, though, until my core is 'ripped' enough to complete the motion.
Be careful if you have hamstring/groin issues or knee issues while doing the Killer Plank Twists.  The first time I did these I was not careful enough about the placement of my legs, and it was painful on my knee.  I've gotten better at adapting this to fit my needs.  Additionally, the Side Burpees are a bit harsh on the knees, but keep trying!

You get sweaty pretty quickly so you're going to want to be able to sweat on something other than your carpet or hardwood floors.  You do some exercise where you sit on your butt, roll back to your shoulders, and then roll forward and stand up.  This would be very painful on a hardwood floor or thin carpet.

Second, of the 5 people doing the workout, 4 of them were using small dumbbells with most exercises.  I didn't have any dumbbells and didn't know I should have had them, but I used 2 cans of coconut water to get me by.  You can do it without dumbbells of course, but either way, the DVD should have mentioned it as an optional/recommended item.

I started to do the workout without a shirt on and found myself slipping all over my mat because I was sweating so much (and I workout 5 days a week).  I had to pause the workout to wipe off my mat and put on a shirt so I could continue without twisting an ankle.

The people doing the workout struggle, and I felt like I was going to throw-up after about 30 minutes.  All-in-all, a very good sign!

In addition to the pure core exercises there are some brief but intense cardio sections and also a few balance moves which make for a nice mix.  I don't get bored. You use weights for the first 10- 15 minutes which I like because you are also working in some upper body strength. I'm in above average shape and do this video as part of my weekly rotation.  I admit there are still a few exercises that I can't do (side plank with leg lifted and the rollbacks) and a few exercises that I hate when I'm doing them but are the moves that are necessary to push myself into a new level of strength.

The ""Totally Ripped Core,"" the first one, was intense.  I found it very easy in the beginning, then a third into the way of the workout, starting with the single leg deadlift, it became difficult.

Not just an ab workout, this is also a lower body workout, with the deadlifts, squats and leg movements.  If you were to add a few more lower body exercises, one could almost retitle this workout as a lower body and ab workout.

The workout is done in a moderate and controlled pace, using two moderate weights for the first half of the workout.  No weights are used in the second half of the workout.

Warmup is about 2 minutes and 12 seconds.
Workout is about 42 minutes and 57 seconds.
Cool-down is about 3 minutes and 11 seconds.

Here's a list of what's done.

Deadlift combos

The second workout, ""Ripped Core Quick Blast,"" was quick and easy when compared to the longer workout.  This one uses one moderate weight. Start with this one if you can't do the longer one.

4523629,5,B0051MKNUY,"This is great ab workout but you also get a nice workout for your legs and little bit for your arms.
My only issue with this workout is the guy background exerciser.  He can barely do the workout and has horrible form though out the entire thing.  I cant believe they let him be in this dvd.",1316563200,,291,4.087719298245614

4523631,5,B0051MKNUY,"I have been doing the 50 minute core workout for a few weeks now (well once a week) and the shorter 10 minute workout.

Overall, this is a very good and through workout.  I have to take a little break in the middle of the 50 mintue workout because it is very tiring (but in a good way).

The only move I could not do completely as demonstrated is the rollback.

I have noticed an improvement in my core, so this workout does help.

It may take a while to get some of the moves in the workout, but you just have to keep at it.",1315699200,4,525,3.9150943396226414
4523632,4,B0051MKNUY,"I don't have much to say about this DVD, other than it is a challenging core workout.  I like both Jillian Michaels and Bob Harper and I can say, both are challenging instructors.  I am loving Bob more lately because his workouts are 1hour long and I feel I need to push myself for longer periods of time to feel challenged.  I love working my core and this workout does just that.  You will need dumbbells for some of the moves, but he also incorporates a lot of plank variations.  If you like Bob as a trainer, you will love this DVD!",1315267200,2,536,4.215686274509804

4523634,5,B0051MKNUY,If your getting tired of doing P90X Core Synergistics; this is a great alternate.  I would say it is just as intense if not more so!  Very well put together and worth every penny.  I feel sorry for the guy in the background who gets very little camera time towards the end of the workout because he can't hang with the girls.  Neither can I!,1314748800,3,341,4.2
4523635,5,B0051MKNUY,"Absolutely an incredible workout.  This workout is challenging.  I always love Bob Harper workouts because he knows how to challenge and push you to the next level.  I have done the inside the method series and outside of Pure Burn Super Strength (my favorite strength training video) this is one of his best.  My abs, glutes, back and arms are sore today.  I have been during Insanity for the past 7 weeks and have not felt soreness like this in awhile.  Definitely a good video to add to the collection.  I am for sure if you use this video along with intense cardio training you will see results in your midsection.  Highly recommend.",1313971200,7,637,4.575221238938053
4523636,3,B0051MKNUY,"Not a great ab workout if you have already done P90X and insanity. I bought it yesterday and did the workout. It doesn't rev you up like insanity and doesn't challenge your abs. I am not sore at alltoday, nor did I feel anything inetnse in my abs during or after the workout. If you do Insanity and P90x, you already have the core strength. There are alot of plank holds and plank holds with arm/leg extensions,which you already do in insanity. Once you have become addicted to the cardio rev up in insanity, its hard to find something as motivating and challenging. I also think Bob is BORING. I prefer Sean T's encouraging, challenging, pushing style of coaching.",1313798400,10,665,4.5966386554621845

Start by raising that heart rate to burn calories and loose weight then work those abs, abs, abs!  Bob eases into it with a short warm up and his cool down is refreshing.

8452908,5,B0051MKNUY,"My core is pretty strong...or so I thought.

I love Jillian Michaels but have done 6 Week 6 Pack and Killer Abs soooo many times now, and I needed a different challenge. The core portions of other dvds just weren't giving me a burn anymore.

Then I bought this. This absolutely lights my abs on fire, and there are moves I can't even finish, which is not the case with the other dvds in my collection. So getting through this in one go is my new fitness goal.

Bob is calm, clear, and pleasant to listen to. The workout includes short bursts of cardio, a constant timer in the corner of the screen so you can see how much of the workout is left, and an option for an easier mod if you need it. It isn't boring. The rock music in the background is enjoyable.

This is a solid addition to my exercise dvd collection, and the reason I just ordered a bunch of Bob's other workouts. I feel like this will really help me take my fitness to the next level. Bring the pain, Bob.",1489536000,,970,4.171122994652406
