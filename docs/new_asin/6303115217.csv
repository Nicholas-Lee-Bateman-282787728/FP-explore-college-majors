However, I have to offer praise for his performance in this episode.  He actually acts like a teenager with overactive hormones with a need to explore, for the first time, what love is.  It reminded me a lot of when I was his age.
The highlight of this episode is the humor.  Worf explaining Klingon flirting rituals is humorous!!  Then there is a scene where Jonathan Frakes (Riker) and Whoopie Goldberg (Guinan) are flirting with each other for a moment.  I actually had to laugh out loud at this.
There was nothing really memorable about this episode and it doesn't stand out as a favorite, but I would recommend it regardless.",1060128000,,778,4.521428571428571

Ignore the silly monster costumes and enjoy the genuine heart and emotion of this episode dealing with first love!",1017878400,3,258,4.468085106382978
7837883,3,6303115217,"This is a stellar episode of the second season.  The Enterprise beams aboard a beautiful woman who is destined to rule an alien planet.  Wesley Crusher has a chance encounter with her and falls in love with her, much to  the disapproval of the girl's caretaker.  This episode gets especially  suspensful when Wes learns that the woman he's fallen in love with isn't  what she appears to be.",961804800,5,390,4.661764705882353
