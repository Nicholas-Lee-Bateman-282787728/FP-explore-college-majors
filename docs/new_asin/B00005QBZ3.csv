7950053,4,B00005QBZ3,"My Pop's used to always sing ""nobody likes me,everybody hates me, guess i'll go eat worms"". So i bought this ""worm eater"" dvd for my dad for his 58th bday, we enjoyed it & all laughed our butts off.",1406246400,2,198,4.102564102564102
7950054,3,B00005QBZ3,"In my sixth grade English class, one of our year-long assignments was to write in a journal. Not necessarily about our personal lives, what lives a sixth grader had in those days I suppose, but anything we felt like expressing. Poems, short stories, lists of video games we wanted for Christmas...whatever. I chose to go the story route, and concocted the adventures of Worm Man and Panda, a deranged individual with a fanatical obsession to save the worms instead of the children. His companion was a cannibalistic panda bear named Panda. They floated around the country in a hot air balloon causing all kinds of havoc. Well, you can imagine what kind of discussion that poor old English teacher had with my mother after she read the journal for herself.

The point here is, ""The Worm Eaters"", is exactly the kind of movie an eleven or twelve year old boy might make. That's what makes it kinda special in a weird way. The humor is goofy and slapstick. The characters are exaggerated and annoying, as adults in children's stories often are. Even the theme song has a ""nya-nya-nya"" feel. And don't forget the heaping helpings of money shots for you Fear Factorites who love seeing squirmy creatures unpleasantly devoured.

The mayor and town council of some Hotel California town want to steal worm-raising hermit Umgar's land. The better to build those yuppie condos! However, Umgar discovers that when a human eats one of his magic ""tenya"" worms, they become a giant worm themselves. Well, more like a man or woman covered in soap and stuffed into a sleeping bag, but who's counting? Eventually, all the baddies, unwanted tourists and golddigers are wormed, and our hero is free to live in peace. Or is he? I won't spoil the ending, but it rolls right along with the boyhood fantasy motif.

This is the only film in the TVM Collection not directed by the man himself. Herb Robins (Steckler's amazing Thrill Killers, The Funhouse) is the guilty party this time, although Mikels produced and distributed the picture and sits in for a mostly descriptive commentary. Like his other tracks, he drops out for long stretches, but does tell some interesting stories and points out where some of the extras (including his own son and one of Tura Satana's daughters!) came from. The only other bonuses are a Mikels filmography, and six trailers. ""10 Violent Woman"" looks great! Sort of a sleazy and wonderful mix between ""Ocean's 11"" and ""Caged Heat"". Expect a review soon.

The Corpse Grinders and Astro Zombies are better intros to the weird world of Ted V. Mikels. If you like those two, you'll probably enjoy ""The Worm Eaters"". Dig that Shaft rip that plays during the chase scene! Check out the clay wheels on that skateboard! And make absolutely sure there's no worms in the popcorn...",1182297600,5,2783,4.815899581589958
7950055,3,B00005QBZ3,"This is a really strange one.  Umgar is an old man who wants to be left alone.  But when unscrupulous parties want to kick him off of his land, Umgar strikes back.
Umgar has been using his land as a resort (that's a laugh but it gets more characters into the story).
Well, Umgar discovers that if people eat his worms they turn into worm people.  Umgar sets out to put worms in the food of the bad guys (like sprinkling them on hot dogs).
Eventually worm people from the lake (unintentional victims) seek either women worm people or revenge on Umgar.
This is a wacky one that makes you wonder how people could not know they are chewing up worms.  If seeing people with worms hanging out of their mouths is not for you, you should skip this one.
This film also boasts one of the silliest theme songs around (yup, sillier than the one from The Blob).",1081468800,4,848,4.314465408805032
7950056,4,B00005QBZ3,"Bill Murry in Caddy Shack meets Motel Hell! This Robins guy is a great comedy actor!! The reason I did not give it a five star is because the supporting acters are not very good. It's too bad a major film company did not pick up this gem. The worm eating is old hat: you see this on many TV shows. But seeing the characters turn into half worms, plus Robins, make this film. The commentary by producer Ted V. Mikels is interesting. I hope Ted keeps doing this on his DVD editions. THIS IS A MOVIE YOU WON'T FORFGET!",1080518400,4,515,4.16
