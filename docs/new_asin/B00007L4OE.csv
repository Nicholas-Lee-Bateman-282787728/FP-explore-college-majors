The only thing I like about this movie is the breathtaking sunset and blue ocean, one star for that.  The other star is for Madonna's short dancing and singing.",1034294400,2,297,4.481481481481482
1818984,5,B00007L4OE,"I just saw this film, and I am quite impressed with what has been accomplished. This film begins as a comedy with Madonna acting like the biggest [witch] you've ever immagined she could be. While the comedy goes on, a great social and political point is set up, to be completed throughout the movie. I'm sure this quality of the film is inherrent from it's original version, however this remake does a nice job of bringing it into a modern prespective. The violence might be a little disturbing, but you have to understand that this is just Guy Ritchie's film making style. Also if you look at the violence from the perspective of its symbolism, it is not so bad. As one of the world's most ""sucessful"" women, I think Madonna has used this film to make a powerful statement. Take a close look and you will find that this is a fine piece of social commentary.",1034294400,5,858,4.471337579617835
1818985,4,B00007L4OE,"Guy Ritchie and Madonna got the idea to remake the 1974 Italian romance
""Swept Away"" from the Internet movie they made together last year for
BMW.
Ritchie directed his wife in a short in which she plays a petulant rock
star who goes on a bumpy ride with a chauffeur played by Clive Owen.
""Swept Away"" is about a wealthy woman stranded on an island who fights
with, then falls for, a communist sailor.
""Madonna saw the original version of 'Swept Away' first, like 20 years
ago. And then we made the BMW commercial. Someone saw that and said,
'Oh this reminds me of ""Swept Away.'"" So one night a friend played it
and I wasn't paying much attention,"" Ritchie told Jane magazine for its
October issue. ""And then I got hooked the second they got in the dinghy
and the engine broke down. I could see what was going to happen.
""By the time the film had finished, I said, 'Someone's got to remake
this movie.' I liked the edge of it. The passion,"" Ritchie said. ""And
Madonna said, 'Why don't you remake it?' I said, 'Well, why don't you be
in it?' She went, 'All right,' and that was that.""
Ritchie's version of ""Swept Away,"" co-starring Adriano Giannini, is
scheduled to open Oct. 11.",1030665600,10,1177,4.453703703703703

1819017,2,B00007L4OE,"Stiff, laughable acting and the story just goes flat.

Madonna's role as the wealthy, privileged woman doesn't help here. Her 'tude here is totally depressing and unattractive. She tries to be funny and fails. She has a quasi-Brit accent that someone born/raised in Michigan could never have naturally which is unintentionally funny. She sneers and pulls faces...I do think her hair looked fab though. She's SO mean. Played that part really, really well. Almost TOO well.

It's like a nightmare come true -being stuck alone with that beyotch. When the sailor yells, ""F -yourself, B!!!"" and ""F- off!!!"", I actually laughed out loud!

The sailor eventually breaks her down, making her call him ""Master"" (""Mah-ster"" when said by M) and likely feeding one of Madonna's personal fetishes of domination -he wants her to be his ""love slave"" and ""her god"", and it's a weird and uncomfortable exercise to watch. Seeing the sailor become an a-hole is also sort of disturbing in itself, because he was initially what I would describe as humble and charming. He's abusive, slaps her face and berates her.

After all this and with half an hour left in the movie, M's personality finally starts to thaw out and they develop an interest in each other that drives her character to NOT want to be ""rescued"" from her predicament.

It's like 1/4 of the movie is actually palatable, and that's only because the tone of her voice and her character softens up, the gorgeous island/ocean scenery, some of it being filmed like one of her music videos, and the ending. That's why I'm only giving it two stars -it's just not enough to carry the movie.

Best roles for Madonna were in ""Something About Susan"" and ""A League of their Own"". SUPPORTING roles. Everything else she's done seems to be a complete bore, just really hard to watch!!!",1410998400,,1813,4.813504823151125

1819022,3,B00007L4OE,"i found the performances by the younger Giannini and an even younger Elizabeth ""Hunger Games"" Banks to be spellbinding. I think it's hard if not impossible for Madonna to act like anyone else because she is and can only be herself, even on screen. I thought the mini montage of her doing Rosemary Clooney ""Come on a my house"" was the high point, campy and elegant at the same time, not unlike Madonna herself. Like ""WE"" and later attempts by her at filmmaking, this is heavy on scenery and location and not on plot.",1389139200,,515,4.48936170212766
1819023,3,B00007L4OE,"The critics gave mostly unfair negative reviews to this movie about the changes a spoiled, wealthy woman goes through once she and a male ship's attendant end up standed on a deserted island together.  The acting is good and confirms that Madonna can act if she is in the hands of the right director. The only thing I found that this movie suffers from is poor editing as Guy Richie, the director and husband of Madonna at the time this film was made, put the focus of the story more on the ship's attendant than on the character played by Madonna. The fantasy scene of Madonna performing in a nightclub was very entertaining and it would be interesting to see what another director could do with her talents in a more expensively produced film such as the in the production values of Evita. Madonna seems to shine the most brightly when her tongue is firmly in cheek and she's doing a comedy send up on the femme fatale dancer/singer type which Madonna can play very well as Madonna does have a sense of humor about herself.  She just needs the right director to bring her humor out more for us to enjoy with her.",1371513600,,1114,4.455882352941177
1819024,5,B00007L4OE,"I loved this movie, and am sad that the negative reviews that it received when it was released in 2002 kept me away from this film. When I heard about how terrible it was, how horrible Madonna's acting was, and how it flopped at the box office, I figured, why bother? But having recently watched this film, I'm glad that I missed it back in '02 when I fresh out of high school. I probably wouldn't have understood it anyway.

Madonna stars as Amber, a spoiled, snobby, arrogant, and bitter trophy wife. Even living in the lap of luxury, sailing on fairytale waters in the Mediterranean sea, Amber is unhappy. Her rich husband submits to her every will, and its clear that she doesn't respect or love him. But she's never challenged to be better, and perhaps deep down she knows it.  The film is about her journey away from selfishness and arrogance to love and respect.

I believe this movie was denigrated because Madonna was in it (people love to hate her), and because of the message against capitalism and materialism, which opposes the driving force of today's society.  Additionally, the movie suggests that deep down inside, a woman's greatest desire is to love, and ultimately, it takes a strong man to unlock the love inside of her.",1370044800,,1241,4.65296803652968

1819026,5,B00007L4OE,"I chose this rating because it was a good movie. What I disliked about the movie was Madonna bosing the man around treating him mean and disrespectful, so when the same is done to her she thinks it's wrong, accept he's even meaner then her.

1819027,1,B00007L4OE,"Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, Madonna surpasses herself in this boringly pretentious 2002 remake of Lina Wertmller's ""Swept Away""  directed in glum fashion by her then-husband Guy Ritchie. A beached whale of a movie, with no camp pleasures. Ritchie and Madonna fared better in a hilarious seven-minute short for BMW titled ""Star"" (2001)  one of the few bright spots in the Material Girl's filmography.",1354147200,7,420,5.161764705882353
1819028,1,B00007L4OE,"I'm a madonna fan, but this movie is unwatchable. The original is excellent, this version does not compare on any level.",1335312000,3,120,4.761904761904762
1819029,2,B00007L4OE,"To say I like Madonna in film (and her second flat attempt to copy an already well-established story, the first being ""Evita"") is to also say that I would rather prefer to eat McDonalds' artifical ""food"" than to sit at a fine restaurant and eat a well-prepared 5-course dinner.

I would love to give you a point by point description of how sad, boring, drawn-out and NON-feminist this movie is as opposed to Lina Wertmuller's fantastic expositive view on male and female roles, society, and love.

Madonna is truly a bitch in this disaster, and the only saving grace is given by the somewhat haphazard attempt to act by her co-star, Giancarlo Giannini lookalike (and son) Adriano. She gives him no real room to stretch out and show any kind of real emotion, and he ends up looking as wooden as the luxury boat they argue on.

I'm disappointed once again by her performance, which shows about as much growth as any 4th grader in their first leading role could.

I want to go on, and normally I do, but I'm going to leave you with this one thought:

The video? Crystal clear, and the island they are deserted on is wonderfully treated - swaying hot tropical jungles, almost white sandy beaches, perfect for two people to connect, both eotionally and sexually if they were deserted and knew that maybe one day they would be rescued.

The audio? Perfect as well.

The movie, the acting, the lack of real substance and horrible non-ending that is nowhere near the original ending and so forced my arm hurt from being twisted so badly? I almost threw up in my mouth a little.

Internationally, Madonna can do no wrong. I expect that in the UK she is as revered as another of our USA saints, Michael Jackson. Here in America? Not so much. Her star has dropped way off the charts a long time ago.

I give this disaster (which, after an abysmal showing in the U.S. theaters, the ""unrated"" U.K. version of the film was released directly to DVD worldwide) 2 stars at best.

Yuk.

I feel so dirty having reviewed this I'm immediately watching the original, which has a wonderful dry sexual spirit to it.

Madonna should NOT quit her day job.",1326672000,3,2129,4.559055118110236
1819030,5,B00007L4OE,I would like to say that this is worth the price it is asking for! I would recommend this to anyone who loves this movie. The only thing that bothered me was that this movie didn't have the audio in Spanish but I should of checked in the first place so that was completely my fault other than that good product and seller!,1326240000,,322,4.126984126984127
1819031,3,B00007L4OE,"While this movie pretends to be just another communism vs capitalism debate showing stock characters portraying each side (the spoiled self-centered but really ""unhappy"" capitalist vs the down to earth kind ""happy"" communist) it really turns the argument (maybe not intentionally) on its ear when the communist becomes in charge and what he does when he gets a lot of money. I don't know if this was just a pretense for the movie--this modern American (was this an American movie?) argument argued by spoiled young Americans. Anyway, it was really just about love . . . another love story. I mean it took a lot of time making propagandistic points about capitalism (unfairly of course . . . ) and communism (again not genuine), but turned out to be a love story. And over all it was a visually pleasing movie . . . pretty scenery, pretty people (Madonna looked like a rich person--her character--instead of her typically usual trashy appearance). Madonna was pretty good (yes I think her acting has been so suspect that we all have to comment on it whenever she is in a movie), even funny in the beginning, I thought. I just wish directors would help her focus and not lapse into her childish, immature behavior. Whenever she does that her acting goes bad. When she gets into the character it seems like she can act and is believable. But just like in Shanghai Surprise, Dick Tracy, Who's that Girl?, etc she gets whiny and silly . . . which I think is part of who she really is as I have seen from her interviews. Anyway, the ending was very very sad. It is a tear-jerker kinda movie. It is a movie best seen on a warm summer day alone when you are not afraid of being sad.",1324425600,4,1674,4.509868421052632
1819032,1,B00007L4OE,"I loved the original infinitely superior film so much more. It is heartbreaking to see such a travesty made of Lina's great masterpiece. Madonna has without a doubt the worst speaking voice of an actress in recent years. It is largely why she will never succeed as an actress in any medium. She also has fans who will not concede where she is a total failure which is why so many, clinging to their lives, have given this five stars! Who do you think you're kidding? When Madonna's fans stop grovelling and start asking her to improve, take time off, get training etc she'll be worthy of her fame. I mean she still can't even sing live properly. I'm a loyal fan of other artists and when they do poor work? I give them an HONEST review. This film leaves out so many important aspects of the origianl. it is also uncomfortable to watch Madonna's exercise addicted body, devoid of all hips, curves and femininity try to be hot. Her face looks wasted and gaunt and yet her body is lean, sinewy and boyish. I'm assuming this is pre-plastic surgery (the one that media keeps telling other women is her ""agelessness"") as one shot in the plane, where she fake cries has her looking like she is nearly sixty. The lead actor simply cannot follow in his father's footsteps, Ritchie is now back on top after moving on (his first film post divorce was the first hit since madonna ruined his career) and viewers should not waste time with this unparalleled waste of film, money but sadly not talent.",1310688000,2,1486,4.5278810408921935

I get the beotch thing so I enjoyed watching Madonna be a hot mess.  This is also a good escape movie.  It's romantic in some ways, you get to see 2 people fall in love.  It has a sad ending, so it's not exactly a fiary tale come true.  It's about what can happen in real life.",1308614400,2,392,4.078947368421052
1819034,1,B00007L4OE,"I would like you to read this summary of ""Swept Away"" and ask yourself if this is disturbing or not.  It's about a selfish, stubborn wife (Madonna) of a rich businessman going sailing across Italy; she often insulted and barked orders at her rugged sailor (Adriano Giannini).  Both her and the sailor took a raft to follow her friends at a expedition, but then the raft's engine stalled and they were stuck on sea until the currents drifted them on an uncharted small island.  From there, the sailor showed the nasty socialite who's boss and forced her to do all his chores, call him master, and be manipulated through physical and mental abuse into his own personal love slave.

Personally, I was terrified.  It sounds too much like a psychological character drama by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lars-Von-Trier/dp/B0002DB52M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lars Von Trier</a>, and yet this film treats this kind of story in a compassionate, loving light; heck, the film even dared to use an Arvo Prt&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/music/dp/B0009VI5CK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">music</a>&nbsp;to express a hint of romance, which was AFTER Madonna's character almost got raped.  I do not know what went on in Guy Ritchie's mind when he had his then-wife involved in such a film.  It's purportedly a remake of a '70s Italian film, and I'd probably give that movie a break given the times and how Italians treat women there, but I can't give the same leniency for ""Swept Away"".  The characters are so horrible and hateful, though to be fair, Madonna's character is suppose to be like that so she can have a personality change later on, but that turned out to be worse.  I felt sorry for the sailor at first, but once he had the upper hand, he went too far and threw away shred of likability about him.  His character could've been better had he just teach her the ways of survival and have her learn to see him eye-to-eye as an equally respectable human being, regardless of class. Instead, he stooped to her level and I hated how he forced her to do his bidding and making her fall in love with him.  This is not a romantic couple, this is a controlling, heartless, painful and scary affair built around male dominance from the primitive ages.

""Swept Away"" has no charm or elegance within this beautiful scenery, this is sadism.  In fact, by the time it reached the third act, I felt the complete opposite of how I was suppose to feel.  I was hoping for the couple to break up, I wanted for the 'bad guy' to win, because the wife has been too mindbroken to settle for such an abusive sailor.  It's movies like this that I had to remind people that there are more incompatible movie couples than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Edward-Bella/dp/B001P5HRMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Edward & Bella</a>.  This might be a film for anti-Madonna fans who like to see her get her just desserts, but she doesn't even deserve this kind of treatment and this is from someone who doesn't like her that much.

To me, this is one of the worst romance films out there, but maybe I just didn't get it.  Considering the average Amazon rating for this movie, there are people who praise this film, and I'm completely baffled.  I was also completely baffled about ""Doctor Zhivago"", an epic film about a man who dumped his family so he can be with a mistress, and yet most people thought it's a masterpiece.  Maybe this film's sadistic nature IS suppose to be charming, and I'm just too sane and level-headed to accept it.",1279929600,3,3632,5.082491582491582

1819038,4,B00007L4OE,"Being a long time Madonna fan I may be as biased as the next one, however, when this movie came out I had heard so much negative buzz about it that I was really worried that it was going to be an embarrassment.  However, I was pleasantly surprised when I finally saw it, and even if I was not the Madonna fan that I am, I believe I would still enjoy it nonetheless.  There are some parts which are better than others, but that's true for any film.  I especially love the scene where you can fully see the change in Madonna's character after catching her own octopus.  There is very little dialogue but you can tell that her character is about to bust from pride and excitement and Madonna is completely convincing.  Other moments which shine are the ""Come-On-A-My-House"" dream scene and the utterly heartbreaking ending, which I would never change.  I think the film is great.  Unfortunately, Madonna's acting is always going to be criticized because her audience can't ever seem to get past the fact that they're watching Madonna in a film.  My point is: when Renee Zellweger plays Bridgette Jones, you watch and think of her as Bridgette Jones, but if Madonna plays anyone or anything, she remains Madonna and not the character she's trying to portray... and though that may be her fault as much as the viewers, I think it's unfair to rule her out as a bad actress when she's not as bad as the critics make her out to be.",1253232000,2,1423,4.488372093023256

THE PLOT: A group of rich Americans take a private cruise from Greece to Italy where a spoiled middle-aged woman, Amber (Madonna), mentally abuses the crew, in particularly the first mate Pepe (Adriano Giannini) whom she constantly refers to as PeePee. The crew puts up with her pompous antics because she's the paying customer, but everything changes when Amber and Pepe are stranded on a deserted Island, putting Pepe in a position of control.

For the record, I'm not a follower of Madonna; I neither love her nor hate her. In fact, I almost didn't watch this film because she starred in it, but I gave-in because I'm a sucker for survival-on-deserted-island flicks. I'd also like to point out that I've never seen the original '74 film, so I have no nostalgic bias.

""Swept Away"" failed at the box office in 2002, but only because it was barely released to theaters and critics condemned it before it was even completed. It subsequently swept (away) the Razzies as the worst picture and a bandwagon effect developed with everyone jumping into the negative feeding frenzy.

Is it really THAT bad? No. Not even close. ""Swept Away"" starts as a fun, entertaining farce and morphs into a potent social commentary and, finally, a moving love story. The movie will make you laugh, make you angry, make you cry and ultimately move you -- no kidding. But it will only have this effect IF you refuse to listen to the drivel of the cookie-cutter critics and give it a chance.

As for Madonna, she's no Meryl Streep but she successfully makes you despise Amber in Act 1 and feel for her later on. She made me believe Amber was a real person. What more do you want?

I'm not an anti-capitalist but the film effectively points out the flaws of this system. It also effectively reveals how money/materialism can't of itself give true happiness, love or fulfillment. Amber had everything but was the most unhappy, loathsome person you'd likely ever meet.

One reviewer referred to the film as a ""wife beater's fantasy"" but failed to point out that it could just as easily be called a ""Man torturer's fantasy"" or ""Man emasculater's fantasy."" Let's be evenhanded with our appraisals.

I admit the physical abuse of Amber on the island (slapping, kicking and especially the faux-rape) is disturbing and almost tempted me to tune out, but then I saw what the filmmakers were shooting for, the filmmakers being Madonna and her husband.

In our society we've been misled to believe that mental abuse is less abusive because it's not physical. This film effectively shows that mental abuse can be just as bad, if not worse.

***SPOILER ALERT***

During the first half hour Amber horribly torments and emasculates Pepe (and others) because she's a spoiled brat and in control. When the tables are turned and she loses control on the island Pepe utilizes extreme measures to de-spoil Amber. In other words, Pepe realized that Amber was so far gone -- so utterly spoiled -- that she literally needed slapped back to reality. This is in line with a biblical proverb ""Blows and wounds cleanse away evil and beatings purge the inmost being."" Let's face it, some people are so far gone (that is, spoiled) that they literally need the snot beat out of them -- that's the only thing that's going to wake 'em up to reality. Apparently Pepe realized this on the island and acted accordingly. Do I think he goes too far? Yes, but -- then again -- I wasn't the one mentally tormented for days on the boat and totally emasculated in front of others. Regardless, the story shows that his methods worked -- Amber was humiliated to the point of seeing life from a totally different perspective, a much-needed new perspective. Pepe's discipline ultimately brings out spiritual character in Amber to the point where she refuses to call on passing boats to save her from her exile (two moving scenes, by the way). Why? Because she's been delivered from the bondage of selfishness, arrogance and materialism; she has experienced true love, fulfillment, team-work, companionship and independence (remember, she DOES learn how to fish for herself) for the first time in her life. It becomes more precious than gold to her and she doesn't want to let it go.

Again, I think Pepe goes too far with the physical abuse (in fact, I don't believe in physical ABUSE at all); he should've stopped with a couple of slaps, at most, but the filmmmakers are (evidently) saying she was so far gone that extreme measures were necessary. Besides, didn't she make her own bed, so to speak? Let her lie in it.

***END SPOILER***

The fact that Madonna -- one of the most successful women in history and the original ""material girl"" -- utilized this film to make this point speaks volumes. Is it a sign of weakness? No, it's a sign of enlightenment and spiritual strength.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Swept Away"" is much better than similar flicks like 1998's ""Six Days, Seven Nights"" with Harrison Ford and Anne Heche. Why? Because, not only is it fun and entertaining, it's also thought-provoking and moving. Really, what more do you want from a stranded-on-a-deserted-island romantic-comedy? Needless to say, those who go overboard with the negative criticism need to get real.

The film runs a short-but-sweet 89 minutes and was filmed in Sardinia and Malta.

The DVD features a 20-minute making-of piece with Madonna and Guy Ritchie interviewing each other. It's an entertaining, informative and revealing piece. The DVD also features 16 deleted scenes.

1819040,1,B00007L4OE,"A better question would be why didn't Madonna and Guy Ritchie ever make another movie  together since this one worked  so well for the both of them? The film is pretty dreadful and has very little to recommend. However there are a  few scenes that are  funny and genuinely  romantic. The highlight of the  film besides  Madonna in a tight two piece black bikini is a great performance from Elizabeth Banks. Banks plays the ultimate dumb blonde who is the younger girlfriend of one of the men on board. She is mocked mercilessly but is too stupid to catch on. What is  interesting is the possible  commentary that Guy Ritchie was making about his marriage.  The divorce details that were all over the gossip pages months ago show up here on  screen. Madonna (in  the movie at least) is extremely shrill, commanding, demanding, and  obsessed with working out. What is more interesting is why Ritchie, coming off of the success of Snatch, would  make this film which has haunted his career ever since. Why would he cast his wife in the lead and make her a very unsympathetic and grating character? The film boils down to this: a bunch of rich snobs rent a boat to sail from island to island on a Mediterranean vacation. The ship is run by mostly Italian sailors. The richies above make fun of the staff's broken English and comment on  how dirty they are. Madonna's character is the worst of them all as she singles out one man in particular . His name is PePe but she calls him Pee Pee just to annoy  him. He takes as much of this as he can.  There is  a hilarious scene where he  dreams of getting his revenge by pouring the food that she finds disgusting all over her and then throwing her off the ship. He then attacks the husband who sits idly by and doesn't say a word. One day while half the party goes to explore some islands Madonna and PePe go off in a separate boat to meet up with them. As it gets later in the day and they get farther away from the ship the engine goes out on them and leaves them stranded . She freaks out but he is amused. He is confident that by  morning they will be rescued. They end up landing on a deserted island where they wait for months  for a ship to spot them and rescue them. While on the island PePe turns the tables and makes Madonna his slave. He roughs her up when he starts slapping and kicking her. He demands that she start calling him Master. He makes her responsible for supplying her own food and shelter. She  also must do his laundry and prepare his meals.  In the middle of this extreme role reversal the two fall for each other.  It is interesting to watch as Richie shows  his wife being  dominated and put in her place by a man. Was he wishing he could do the same in real life? While on the island she opens up to PePe and offers an explanation for why she is unhappy. She explains that she's  bored with her life. She tells him that this is the first time she has been happy in a long time is  being here with him. PePe wonders if she will feel the same way when they are inevitably rescued and brought back to civilization. As  mentioned some of these scenes, complemented by the beautiful island backdrop, are very romantic and tender which makes the ending kind of bittersweet. Ritchie even throws in an exciting dance number showcasing his wife's ""talents"". It is an interesting film with some good moments but there is also a lot of unfunny jokes and annoying Madonna moments to wade through between the very limited good parts.",1231718400,3,3492,4.362229102167182
1819041,2,B00007L4OE,"Being someone who came of age in the mid-80s, Madonna was a big deal to me and I loved her music (still do ... most of it). Her movies, not so much, except for Desperately Seeking Susan. But I'd seen the original movie Swept Away was based on (Lina Wertmuller: check her work out), and was intrigued enough to see another Madonna movie. But this was plain terrible. It's not a faithful remake (with a different ending, more soap opera-ish), and it's overall just bad. Madonna just can't act her way out of her persona; it's too strong. Everyone else is pretty much so-so in this, but I'd leave it up in the air as to whether to blame the director, the rewrite he did, or the acting. It's pretty cartoony and ham-fisted stuff, though. But back to the remake: They don't have to be faithful to the letter, but the original (same name, but with a long subtitle) had so much punch and passion. The rich wife that gets swept away with the socialist sailor and their bickering is hot, intense, fun to watch. It's a great movie in itself, and it has depth with the class issues and smoldering sexuality beneath that bubbles up as these two are stranded. Plus it's tantalizing to watch the power struggle between the leads (in the original, again) as power shifts back and forth. This new version is just awful. No tension, no cleverness, no wit, no insights; just an aggravating 90 minutes.",1228694400,2,1383,4.51394422310757

This turkey deserves a zero! Atrocious acting and ponderous direction. It does absolutely no justice to the original by Lina Wertmuller but then the ORIGINAL SWEPT AWAY is a one of a kind gem of 70's foreign art house film. Guy Ritchie should never have cast Madonna and as untalented as she is, here it's painful and pitiful. If someone can't sing or act as is the case with madonna then I except them to be funny and campy-madonna is not campy OR funny. She looks (as she has for most of her life) like an exercise junkie and severely haggard. Why no one told her to bow out is beyond me. The black bikini houses a tiny, square, masculine female body, with no hips or breasts that frankly, for all her exercise, looks weak and desperate-the ""Anti-Amazon"" and a shape completely opposite of the great Hollywood sex goddesses.

1819046,1,B00007L4OE,"""Swept Away"" - was written and directed by Guy Ritchie, starred Madonna and Adriano Gianini and based on ""Swept Away...by an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of August"" (1974), directed by Lina Wertmuller with Giancarlo Giannini playing the same role as his son 28 years later. This is a story of class and sexual struggle between a man and woman stranded on a desert island. Madonna plays Amber Leighton, the arrogant wife of a rich American pharmaceutical mogul (Bruce Greenwood) who travels on a private yacht from Greece to Italy with friends. Her constant bitching annoys a first-mate Giuseppe Esposito... (Andriano Giannini)

I cannot believe that the same Guy who is behind stylish, energetic, funny, and full of wonderful tunes and interesting characters ""Snatch"" made it. Acting made me and my husband cringe dozens of times. I have not seen the original movie and would like to compare the two but the scenes between two main characters on the island in the Ritchie's movie were simply gross and tasteless. Giannini seemed to not having inherited any of his father's talent or charisma. The ending seemed so overtly sentimental and out of place. There were only three redeeming values. First, the beginning was kind of funny with Madonna playing the arrogant uber-bitch very convincingly. Second, deserted island and beach somewhere in Mediterranean sparkle. Third, and most important, the whole thing was only 89 minutes long.

I am not trying to trash Madonna's acting because heaven knows she's been called every name in the book already, but if this movie is any representation of her acting skills she should quit while she's ahead and go back to singing and dancing. Included on the DVD is the MTV special that Madonna did with her husband which is in all actuality better than the movie itself because Madonna seems more human and relaxed.

Madonna is so bad she can't even play a rich, pampered bitchy rich lady, I guess she had no idea where to look for inspiration? The politics and class which put these characters at odds in the first movie have been surgically removed and rather bland sexual desire is put in its place. Sorry but I find if hard to believe an latin man would find the .0002 body fat, over worked out Madonna sexy. The hardness of her physical appearance should add something to her self obsessed character but her unbelievable delivery of lines is just too distracting and undermines any chance of fleshing out her role.

1819054,3,B00007L4OE,"I deeply enjoyed the original version of Swept Away in 1974 and wanted to see what Madonna and Guy would do with it.  The M&G version is a film that tells the story about the relationship of a man and woman that is beyond the film itself; the relationship between Madonna and Guy.
Since it can be bought or rented, it is worth the price just to see the interview included in the DVD that Madonna conducts with Guy and that Guy tries to conduct with her.  Guy who wrote the screenplay, owes much to Lina Wertmuller for the story, but what he brings out of his wife and what he gets her to do as director-husband, is more interesting.  Guy must have had a fascinating and wry time writing the screenplay knowing Madonna would star. Also, the respect and follow through actress-wife gives to her husband-director is fascinating.  They both have a sense of purpose and humor, although Guy teases wife-actress more, especially since he is among a manly crew, but Madonna takes most of it in stride--she even forgives him for eating her lunch, he refers to her as Mrs. Richie.
Guy gets opposing performances from M, from being nasty and mean to getting her to grovel after she and Andriano Giannini are marooned.  Madonna-groveling and powerless. Who else could get that?
His creation and direction of Andriano's fantasy/hallucination of Madonna dancing and holding/catching various objects is pure folly and fun.  Madonna really enjoys herself here, pleasing her director-husband and not just putting on another queen-of-the-music-video performance.  It is interesting to observe Guy's obvious testosterone concern during the shoot, as Madonna and Andriano practice their spread-eagle-on-the-beach romantic scenes; he even inquiring as to how much their lips touch.
In these days of famous people having short marriages, diva divorces and lover scandals, this is a fascinating film that displays the talents, creativity and the love of both husband and wife in a project they worked on together.

Or wear the same clothes for a month and have them look like new?  No nicks, no tears, no nothing!  How is it that we never see either of the two naked -- even when they are having sex?  Last I checked I had to take *my* shorts and briefs off!  And, the coup de grace, as far as I am concerned is hair -- growth -- the lack of, that is.  After a month, neither of the two had any more hair than they started with -- head, face, underarms, legs, anywhere.

Yes, modern societal mores may dictate that TV shows have women with shaven arms and legs having sex wearing underwear, but this is not a daytime soap.  It's a R rated movie!",1135987200,3,897,4.192982456140351
1819058,3,B00007L4OE,"I have to admit this film was somewhat of a guilty pleasure for me. I actually enjoyed it, and found it to be nowhere near as bad as the critics ruthlessly dismissed it to be. I think by now the critics just automatically follow suit in trashing any Madonna movie vehicle and have made up their minds before they even see it. Having said this, I will also agree that Madonna will never be an Academy award winning actress. She's an amazing music and performance artist, but she comes off much better on stage and in music videos, than as a film actress. I don't know what it is, I don't think it's just the fact that we can't forget she's 'Madonna'; I think it's also her voice, it's a bit tinny and flat. Although she seems much less self-conscious and wooden in this film and her performance more believable, when you put her next to her co-star, Adrianno Giannini, she comes off as an amateur in comparison. Still they did have chemistry, and I found the love affair that grew between their characters quite tender and moving. And yes the ending is sad, but appropriate I think.
This 70's film remake probably suffered also because it's just out of place today and too politically incorrect. It's really more of an arty European style film, and frankly I think Madonna is just too commercial to pull it off. Without meaning to sound patronizing, I feel that many rather 'conditioned' more westernized audiences, may not get the point of it, and would find it too daringly offensive to women. There are however, many subtexts to this film and it does have some interesting and rawly honest things to say about power in a falsely, capitalistic society versing power in nature, and also the balance of power in male/female relationships (as well as the male ego).
The scenery and locations are beautiful and the music also fitting, but Guy Ritchie's script, which he admitted to improvising and writing as he filmed, is quite weak and not terribly inspired. The supporting cast don't have much to work with here but do a sound job. Jean Tripplehorne, plays her part well, and I actually found Madonna quite amusing in parts. She does like to swear a lot though doesn't she, both in real life and on screen. In the 'extra feature' off camera segments, every second word that comes out of her mouth is ""f***ing"". Does she think it impresses people? Not me I must say. It makes her come off as coarse and a bit childish. The 'Amber' character is is quite fitting for her in a way, however if I were a male, I don't know that I'd find her very muscular and adrogynous physique particularly attractive. I think she needs to soften her look a bit for film roles like this. She looks more like an athlete in training than a pampered millionairess.
Also, it seems apparent that Guy Ritchie was none too comfortable in shooting scenes with his Mrs in the clutches of another man, though he didn't seem to mind her being slapped and kicked around. The sex scenes (or lack of) aren't very realistic or erotic, and Madonna I notice, modestly covers her breasts in every coital scene (this from the woman who bared all in her sex book!). The fact that they were living so naturally in the primitive Island setting could have waranted raunchier and earthier sex scenes. May have also helped to sell more tickets too!
Overall though, this is one of Madonna's better outings and she's not at all bad in this film. Some might say Guy Ritchie will never live this one down, but I'm sure he anticipated the risks of making such a film with his mega-famous wife. No doubt he calculated a financial return at least in the home video market, from all those not game to see it in the cinema. Even if you're not a Madonna fan see this film if you're curious, and don't always be swayed and controlled by 'the critics'. Talk about balance of power, they have too much of it over audiences I think.",1135728000,2,3872,4.540772532188841

I just hope men don't see this and think hell yeah!  That's how I can get what I want. That might sound a little far fetched but acts of domestic violence against women occur every 3 seconds in the UK alone. That's in the western world.

Only in a movie guys! Real woman aren't secretly thinking oh yeah id love to get beaten into submission and sexually forced. I heard some woman fantasize about rape, but believe me its very different from the real thing. That's why it's called a fantasy. Just like most men fantasize about raping woman, it doesn't make them rapists unless they actually commit the act. I'm sorry, I don't mean to waffle on about this, but I've had my own taste of domestic violence and this movie isn't doing woman any favours. This movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.

1819067,1,B00007L4OE,"I'm a big fan of movies and it takes a lot for not to be able to enjoy a movie. This movie however is as bad as you've heard. I don't know what Guy Ritchie was thinking. He was the reason I saw this because I love Snatch. This movie is nothing to the level of Snatch.

Amber Leighton(Madonna) is a very wealthy woman. She is very cold and hates almost everybody. She has a flaw for everything and is very upset with the vactation that her husband Todd planned.

Giuseppe ""Peppe"" Esposito(Giannini) is an italian sailor working on the yacht that Amber is touring the Mediteranean on. He is given the assignment to take care of her every need and is always at her beckon call. The two hate each other and it's obvious. Peppe can't do anything though because he's the servant and it's his job to put up with all her crap.

While on the boat one day Amber misses the diving trip with all the other passengers. She demands that Peppe take her even though he says it's not safe to venture out. The two do and suprise suprise the raft motor breaks and strands the two.

The two find an island after some time at sea and Peppe has had enough of Amber. He quickly puts his foot down and tells her that he is the master know and she is his servant in all aspects. If she wants to survive she will do his will no matter what it is. She is disobiedient to him at first but after he slaps her around and beats her she comes around to liking him some.

The tension only continues to grow between the two and after Peppe rapes her on the beach Amber starts to fall for him. She knows he's the only way she can survive so she submits to his will and falls in love with him. Peppe doesn't know if the love is ture though and wants to get off the island. Amber however wants to stay because the two can't be together if they are ever found.

The movie is just horrible. From all aspects is it bad. The acting isn't good and Madonna needs to just give it up. She is a singer and should stick to that. I hate her character, but could never separate the two from each other.

Adriano Giannini isn't all that bad in the movie and is given the most to work with. However, there is no man patient enough in the world to put up with what his character goes through and that kills the movie. Amber is taken way to far early on. It is great though getting to watch Madonna get slapped by Giannini mutiple times.

The rape scene was the final straw for me. It was stupid and not believable the way they shot it. The whole idea of her falling in love with him after he does it is a far stretch as well. By the time this happened I really was looking forward to the end of this.

The love scenes are another bad thing in the movie. They aren't believable at all. You can tell Ritchie isn't comfortable shooting his nude wife with another man. He should have cast a different actress or not tried to shoot the scenes.

The movie is bad. The critics were right on this time. This movie should have been ""Swept Away"" to a dump because thats where it belongs. There is nothing good about this film except for some nice sets and scenery but even that can save it. So save some brain cells and miss out on this one.",1094947200,5,3179,4.137763371150729
1819068,3,B00007L4OE,"OK why in the world was this made out to be a comedy?  I was expecting by the reviews the critics gave, that this movie would be fun to make fun of.  I was wrong.

I don't think I laughed once.  It wasn't funny.  Not that that is a bad thing, I think this film was marketed wrong.

It gets a little carried away in the melodrama sometimes (what's with that faux rape scene?), but overall I thought this film was very very sad.  It had a Romeo and Juliet theme, in which two people from two different worlds are kept from each other even though they are in love.  But are they really kept from each other?  Madonna's character ""Amber"" could have easily just said ""screw society, this is the man I love,"" but she didn't.  I think that says a lot about people's inability to change.

On the whole, I wouldn't say this movie is horrible.  It surprised me with its ending, which is a rarity nowadays.  I just don't know why they marketed it as comedy.

And by the way, this is the first Madonna film I have seen, so I don't know how she acted in other films.  But in this one I found her delightful, I believed in her character and that is the aim of any actor.  See for yourself.",1093824000,,1175,4.132743362831858

1819070,3,B00007L4OE,"For a movie that was deadpanned by the critics this film is actually not so horrible. It is visually stunning with great scenes of Greece and the Mediterranean islands.

Madonna stars in this movie as a rich aristocrat with no soul; she is bossy, obnoxious and bitchy. Her character is entirely unlikable and her performance is bland. She perks up after she gets stranded on an island with the super hunk Adriano Giannini, who wouldn't! Once Madonna's role is pared down to survival her acting gets better too. Giannini is excellent as an Italian fisherman trying to earn a few extra bucks working on a Greek yacht. The story becomes a bit predictable until the ending which is actually quite sad.

This film's redeeming quality is found in the gorgeous backdrops as well as Giannini's character. It is a blatant slap in the face of the rich and powerful and shows them as a lower class hidden beneath all their wealth. Maybe that is why this film fared poorly at the box office! An afternoon would not be wasted getting swept away by this visually beautiful film.....the story might leave you begging for something more but it isn't horrible.",1092268800,,1143,4.738693467336684
1819071,3,B00007L4OE,"OK, let me start off by saying this movie wasn't what the critics made it out to be. The movie was actually good. Although Madonna's acting, as usual, left something to be desired, you can't help but think to yourself, she played the part off though . . . .and that's exactly what she did.
Firstly, I'd like to say that the script killed the movie. It wasn't a bad movie, it was just a horrible script. I cringed to so many parts of the film because I thought to myself, ""I know Madonna knows this isn't going anywhere."" That's why some complained, because the fact that it took so long to get into the movie, because honestly, the movie took off when Madonna and Adrianno were stranded, and the climax was the very unexpected ending. (I haven't seen the first, so it was unexpected to me.)
Madonna's nonchalance acting wasn't very believeable and at times, it was quite cheesy, but this was probably her best acting preformance after Evita ofcourse. The movie was saved by the acting of Adrianno, and the chemistry that him and Madonna shared. It was good to see a movie that stepped out of the love story clich'e a little bit.
The music in the movie was thoughtful and very good to listen too, especially the song that is playing while Madonna and Adrianno are sitting down with eachother to an orange sunset. My favorite song , well instrumental, has to be the instrumental that is played on several parts of the movie, and for the ending credits. (the instrumental I'm speaking of is titiled ""Partied"" on the soundtrack) The music montages that guy came up with were also funny, and that preformance by Madonna to a classic by Della Reese was also great.
I remember months before the movie came out it was getting a media blitz for being Madonna's next movie, but then weeks before it came out the critics destroyed it, and I'm sure that's why it was a box office bomb, because too many people took the point of view of critics that were criticizing Madonna more so than her acting. I thought that was ludicrious, and it was obvious because the movie wasn't at all what they made it out to be. But now in all honesty, it seems as though if a star couple gets together and makes a project, for instance, a movie, it bombs single-handedly. That's what happened to Gigli. Gigli was what the critics said, but they overblown this movie, which was at fault by from the dull script, not Madonna;s acting, although she was overshadowed by the powerful preformance of Adrianno.
Madonna isn't given credit for the wide array of roles she chooses, but honestly, that's exactly what she needs to rethink. Some of the roles Madonna potrays in films can only make me wonder, ""Why?"" She needs to reanalyze her intuition in choosing roles. I think she is still trying to gain respect from critics for her acting. She's still trying to get her Oscar like Cher did. She was humiliated because she said to a lot of reporters on interviews that she will win the Oscar for her role in Evita, but after her Golden Globe win she found out she wasn't nominated. I think they only did that to upset her and because she's ""Madonna."" She deserved an Oscar for Evita, if not a nomination at least. Madonna isn't the best actress in the world, but neither is the overated Julia Roberts, and she certaintly isn't a bad actress. Heloooooooooo she has a Golden Globe. Julia Roberts is remembered for two movies only, which are Still Magnolia's and the all time favorite Preety Woman. Madonna on the other hand with less success in the acting relm, is known for more than two movies, excluding the one's that bombed and were critically panned. Madonna has roles that she is known for: Desperatly Seeking Susan, Dick Tracy, A League Of Their Own, and her climax Evita. Evita was her role of the lifetime, and usually that term comes garnered with an Oscar, but they weren't ready to give her one yet, at least for her acting. It's ironic that many critize Madonna's talent as an actress but she's known for more roles that she played than heavyweights like Gweyneth, Julia, Kate, Sandra, and others. She's better than some actresses that don't get bad reviews like: Salma Hayek, Penelope Cruz, Debra Messing, Jennifer Anniston, and others. Like I said, I think that just cause she's Madonna they try to keep her stray from acting praises. It's obvious that critics don't quite favor the singer turned actor . . .let's face it.
See this movie. At least rent it from Blockbuster or watch it on HBO. Trust me it's not what the critcs claimed it to be. It's not the best movie in the world, certainly not Madonna's best, but it's quite close. I cried at the end . . .so you know this movie is emotionaly driven. Trust this review, I'm not biased because it did kind of cut up my favorite actress Julia Roberts. (I say that beacause I said she was overated . . .and she is. The fact that she is America's Sweetheart is what makes her movies so appealing, but her roles are very redundant and not to wide, while Madonna's are. Julia won an Oscar for Erin Brokovich . . . .and Madonna didn't even get a nod for Evita . . .that's why I say Julia is very overated, because for a role like she played on Erin Brokovich she gets garnered with an Oscar. That's not her lifetime role, but I guess because she's Julia then it's OK. Case closed!) Believe me, this is a must see.",1089417600,2,5334,4.5056759545923635
1819072,3,B00007L4OE,"When my wife brought this movie home, I looked at the DVD and thought: Wait a minute...oh no, this is that Madonna film that got panned left and right...what did you do?  But it was a rainy Friday night (movie night), and nothing else was on, so I went into this with the lowest of expectations.
I am certainly not a big Madonna fan.  While I admire how she's been able to reinvent herself musically, her acting ability leaves something to be desired.  Her acting in this movie was not good...not good at all.  But that aside, I felt the supporting cast was excellent, especially Adriano Giannini.  Next to him, Madonna looked like an awkward first year high school drama student.  Had someone else played the role of Madonna's spoiled rich girl, say Annette Bening or Debra Winger, the movie would have probably done much better.  Madonna's lack of screen credibility doomed this one right out of the gate.  Granted, Madonna's getting up there in age, but I was struck by how old and gristly she looked...even with makeup.
The cinematography was actually really good.  Shots of the beach, panoramic shots of the ocean, the flora and fauna, all were visually pleasing.  I'd probably watch the DVD again for that alone.
Would I run out and buy it? No. Would I rent it? Yes. Only if there was nothing else to choose from.  On an ""A"" to ""F"" grading scale, it's a solid ""C-"".",1085184000,2,1371,4.577868852459017

  Madonna plays Amber Leighton, a 40 year old rich woman, who as everything she wants, but it is very unhappy. She is a hard, demanding, selfish, cruel, cold hearted woman. People must obey her every command. Amber, her husband, Tony, and their friends, Michael, and his wife Marinna, and Todd, and his girlfriend Debi, all take a cruise to Italy and Greece. There, they meet Guiseppe (Peppe for short) (played by Adrianno Gianinni), a poor Italian fisherman. Peppe goes through constant torture and frustration with Amber. She annoys his with her selfishness and cruelness. One morning, the two get on a raft to catch up with everybody else, but they get lost. They find an island, which happens to be deserted, as usual. When they get to this island, Peppe turns the tables and tells Amber that he is now in charge. He wants her to know and feel what it's like to be treated like crap, to know and feel what it's like to fend for someone else. As Amber begins to change, the two begin to fall in love.
  Don't get me wrong. The movie wasn't all that bad. I just wish it could have ended better. That's the only thing I dislike about this movie.",1073952000,,1349,4.405622489959839
1819074,3,B00007L4OE,"I guess it would be all too easy to take the critic's word for it, and believe Swept Away is a complete disaster - ruined by Madonna's ""wooden"" performance.  But considering Swept Away grossed something around $500,000 at the box office and is available at very few stores or film rentals, I don't think most of this film's detractors have actually seen it. It seems like everyone today is talking about how bad an actress Madonna is (and in no small way comparing this film to Glitter or Gigli), but if everyone who criticizes this film has actually seen it, wouldn't it have made a lot more money?
That said, the film is good. The only problem I had with it was the rape scene. It is hard to believe that a woman would fall in love with a man who tried to rape her. However, the love scenes are truly touching (the most affecting is a series of love scenes to the sound of ""Fade into You"" by Mazzy Star) and the ending is tender and thought-provoking.  Although Swept Away is not all it could have been, it is a thoughtful and entertaining love story benefitted by a sincere and admirable performance by Madonna. As a dynamic character, she is believable and touching. I dare you to say Madonna can't act after you have seen this film, particularly the scene where she is crying in the helicopter at the the end of the film. .
People have been much too harsh towards this film. I don't think it was intended to be a blockbuster - the production seemed relatively small. It is, however, a funny, touching, and thought-provoking love story with a tender performance by Madonna and a great score (if you can overlook the sometimes loud tropical music in favor of the subtle orchestrations, piano, and brilliant song choices).  A hidden gem that looks good in my DVD collection next to other underrated classics, such as Far and Away (remember when people complained Nicole Kidman couldn't act?  She showed them!) and Artificial Intelligence.",1073865600,2,1940,4.614492753623188
1819075,4,B00007L4OE,"I was the biggest skeptic about this film, but I decided to give it a chance, because I always thought that Madonna was actually so much of a better actress than the critics have portrayed her.
I enjoyed this film; it was funny, the chemistry between Madonna and Adriano Gianni (Pepe) is superb. I couldn't have imagined either one playing opposite someone else in this film. The film is a perfect 3-acter: Madonna's character before (vain, mean) the love affair; during (funny, vulnerable, smart, loving), and after (confused, torn, changed). Each act is impressively well-developed.
Her love affair with Gianni's character -- showing how it goes from literal hate to a tender love -- is portrayed in a very real, human way, and it makes sense. Amazingly, it's not sappy. It's kind of bittersweet.
The only scene I felt was silly and out-of-place was the fantasy sequence where Madonna dances and sings. It was pure music video, and I wish it had been cut, even if it does add a splash of bright color.
The ending is sad, which makes it different and unexpected.

The dance/dream sequence is quite well done and the ending is a bit tender with the helicopter flying away & soft piano playing. Well worth checking out.",1072656000,2,473,4.386363636363637

After you watch Swept Away, your answer about Madonna's acting abilities will be negative. Madonna is always Madonna no matter how hard she is trying to convince you she is not. Madonna is like that wolf from the fable who tries to disguise himself in the lamb skin, but all in vain. Either wolf's ears show up, or his tail or his teeth start to show. During the movie I was unable to get away from the impression that I am watching some Madonna's home video recorded by Guy for their private viewing.
The movie is supposed to be a remake of the 1975 movie. The basic story is that a bitchy wife (no idea on what account) of a rich businessman and a bunch of friends go on holidays on a boat. Something happens and Madonna and some other loser actor get stuck on a deserted Island Bonita. A horrible wife gets tamed by a loser, they fall in love, and yadayada.
The movie is not funny, it is heavy handed, and you don't believe a word of what they say on the screen. The only idea I had all movie through (yes, I took the pain to watch it to the end) was how Madonna got herself in this mess?
At some point I was thinking to myself what if Madonna doesn't have friends who can tell her that her movies suck, and that she should do something about it. Who knows? In any case, Swept Away is no good. If you buy it, you'd waste your bucks. Unless of course you are a Madonna's fan and can eat Madonna under any sauce.

There is a thing called a bandwagon, and many infant minded people tend to jump right on it.
With that being said, I am glad I took it upon myself to watch this movie despite of the horrible reviews. I enjoyed it immensely and was shocked at the ending.

1819081,2,B00007L4OE,"Madonna has tried so hard over the years to establish herself as a film actress, that every time she makes a movie I secretly hope that she'll finally succeed. Unfortunately ""Swept Away"", although not the horrific mess it was portrayed to be in the press, is a mediocre film. ""Swept Away"" is the story of a rich socialite who ends up stranded on a deserted island with a tempermental fisherman who she eventually falls in love with. The film is neither as funny or romantic as it was hoping to be. This isn't entirely Madonna's fault, but her performance isn't particularly great. I don't think Madonna is a terrible actress, but I think she should stick to supporting roles (like she did in ""A League of Their Own"", ""Desperately Seeking Susan"", etc.) She just doesn't have what it takes to carry a film. The qualities that makes her a great pop star actually get in the way of her acting; every move she makes seems too smooth and choreographed and the result is that she appears wooden onscreen. Adriano Giannini is convincing and sexy as her love interest, and the two do have some chemistry. And the gorgeous Mediterranean scenery does make the film easy on the eyes. But overall, unless you're a huge Madonna fan, (or hate her so much that you'd really enjoy seeing her slapped repeatedly), I'd say skip this one.",1065744000,12,1318,4.636752136752137
1819082,2,B00007L4OE,"Some say that this film may not be as bad as critics say, and yes, I agree.  But if you ask me whether the new version ""Swept Away"" remade from the 1974 Italian original deserves a bad name, well, I also have to agree.
Let's forget the fact it's Madonna's film directed by Madonna's hubby Guy Ritchie.  Even so, this ""Swept Away"" starts very shakily; we are introduced to the group of not so likable people on a cruising boat.  Madonna is the ice queen Amber, ordering Italian fisherman Giuseppe serving her as lackey to do whatever she thinks of so cruelly, and she treats him as if he is an animal ... no, worse, she abuses.  Fans, is that what you want to see?  And she is so alarmingly convincing, too.  If only she is Meg or Goldie, we might be enchanted.  But of course, she is not.
Then Amber and Giuseppe are swept away (after several of very silly events) by the tide on a small broken boat, and they reach a small deserted island where no one lives.  You know it's the table-turning time, and Giuseppe, far apt to adjust to the new stuation, takes the initiative.  Now see what he does.  He slaps Amber several times, plus gives some kicks to her body, and even orders her to him ""Master.""
And sfter these incredibly rough proceedings, a true love is born between them.  Sorry, but I don't believe that.  Especially when you see an improvised musical section in which Madonna starts to lip-sync to the song ""Come on-a My House.""  And it was inserted as if to extend the running time, which should have been much shorter.
Even if it's not Madonna, the film would be a fiasco.  The film's tone is not constant, with jumbled mixture of anything you think of on the hot deserted island.  The love is sincerely described, or at last they try to do so.  But when we are surprised to find that tender tone superceding the film's story, things are almost over.
Maybe I should not say so, but Madonna is born in 1958.  Of course, she is still beautiful, but in this film, Guy Ritchie mysteriously refuses to show her that way.  Actually, Amber's character is so nasty at first, and her usual charms all vaporized under the scorching sun, so you cannot find the Madonna as we know her.
Whether Madonna can really act or not is a tough question to answer, and I don't know still the truth about it, but Madonna of ""Swept Away"" is not definitely the Madonna her fans want to see.  And the actor Adriano Giannini is just a typical Italian hunk, nothing more.  While watching this film, I wished that Tom Hanks and some backetball turned up suddenly, and take over the film entirely.  That ""Wilson"" was great, indeed.",1065398400,2,2613,4.436058700209643
1819083,4,B00007L4OE,"Having recently purchased & viewed this DVD, I'm a little confused. Where's the bad? I think Madonna gives one of her finest performances in this movie. I'm unfamiliar with Adriano Giannini, but I thought he did an excellent job with his role. I also liked the way Guy Ritchie put this film together and the scenery was beautiful. Was there anything I didn't like? Sure. I didn't like the ending. It was well acted, but not the kind of ending I enjoy. Also, the progression from hate to love between Madonna and Adriano's characters seemed a little fast.
If I'd seen this movie in a theater I wouldn't have felt like I'd wasted my money. Having purchased the DVD, I don't feel like it was a waste of my money. I don't know why everyone was so harsh about this movie. I've seen some bad films but this wasn't one of them. Perhaps the fact that it's a remake led to some poor reviews. Perhaps the fact that a woman was slapped offended some people. Who knows? Whatever it was that caused such horrible reviews, I didn't see it.
It's a good romantic film. Two very different people find love and ultimately happiness under extreme circumstances. If you're going to watch this movie, I challenge you to do so without preconceived notions. Put aside what the critics have said about this film as a whole and about Madonna's acting in general.

The media completely bashed this film, and most people I spoke to about the film never saw the original, they obviously did not understand the movie and what the message was. I think seeing the original first will help people understand the film much better. The dialogue was not as drastic and moving as the original, but I expected them to tone most of the film down to accomodate the north american viewers. Madonna did a pretty good job and had tough shoes to fill in this remake, and Adirano Giannini was just as good, but not better, then his old man.
I have to give this movie 5 stars as it was still just as moving as the original. Although there was not as much slapping around, and a lot less political talk, the ending moved me much more then the ending of the 1974 version.
I have to give Guy Ritchie props, as it's not easy to remake such a well crafted Italian movie, it's like trying to remake a Ferrari of your own, very hard to do.",1064793600,8,1090,4.348039215686274
1819085,2,B00007L4OE,"This movie got horrible reviews and it deserved them because it was a [####] poor remake. The original had great dialogue. In this remake, the characters of Pepe & Amber just curse each other out, are abusive toward one another for an hour and 20 minutes-- then next thing you know, they're in love for the last 15 minutes of the movie. You don't really see them fall in love. You don't know why they're so deeply in love. It could be because they're both very beautiful and tan. The character development is bad. You don't really care about them. It's predictable, but getting there is supposed to be half the fun. You know what's going to happen, but sometimes you need to see HOW it happens.
Adriano Giannini is so freakin' hot, but I didn't understand why his beard didn't grow after being stranded for a month. Can you imagine the smell of these two? A month with no soap,deodorant,toilet paper or toothpaste? Gross. The cinematography is lovely and so is the music. So watch (rent) this movie and decide for yourself. And again may I reiterate how hot Adriano Giannini is. Madonna has almost singlehandedly revolutionized how women in their 40's are viewed. And I love her for that. I still have many years before I am her age, but I still appreciate what she's done. I highly recommend seeing the original ""Swept Away"" (with Adriano's father Giancarlo Giannini). It's a much better film. Then compare it to this version. Guy Ritchie's adaptation is pretty, but that's all. Nothing more than a vehicle for his wife.",1063324800,5,1521,4.67910447761194
1819086,1,B00007L4OE,"At the box office, Madonna's ratio of success to failure has been roughly one to a million, and ""Swept Away"" apparently did nothing to change that statistic.  It was roasted by critics, shunned by moviegoers, and having finally seen it, not only can I understand why, but I can also sympathize with those who actually bothered to see it in theatres.  In this hopelessly inept remake of the 1974 film of the same name, Madonna is Amber, the agitated wife of a millionaire who boards on a cruise with two other couples.  Never satisfied with anything, she barks orders at the hapless worker Guiseppe (Adriano Giannini), and misses no opportunity to belittle him.  For reasons I won't bother to explain, Amber and Guiseppe end up on a deserted island, where Guiseppe becomes enraged by Amber's nasty behavior and slaps her around and forces her into submission for much of their stay.  This role reversal is supposed to warm up Amber's ice-cold demeanor, and she eventually ends up in a love triangle where she's torn between Guiseppe and her husband.  And so on.  But what you really wanna know is: ""Is Swept Away"" as bad as they say it is?  Well, it's bad.  Not merely because of Madonna's performance, which proves once again that she can't act.  It's not merely because of director (and Maddy's husband) Guy Ritchie.  And it's not bad merely because it's painfully boring.  ""Swept Away"" reeks chiefly because of its sexist plot, which basically says that an unreasonable woman can be ""tamed"" if you smack her around a few times and force her to call you ""master"" as Amber did at Guiseppe's command.  To avoid this movie is to preserve 90 minutes of your life.  You'll have me to thank.",1062201600,18,1686,4.709897610921502
1819087,4,B00007L4OE,"Let's face it, Madonna's acting abilities are passable at best.  She has done horrily, e.g. ""The Next Best Thing"" (although I loved the script), and ""Body of Evidence"" (I could only sit through that film once).  She has also performed beyond expectations, e.g. ""Evita"" (much more enjoyable in the theatres...on video, it's like sitting through a 2 hour music video) and ""Snake Eyes"" (I know...no one's ever heard of it, but she truly rises above expectations in that film).
Her performance in ""Swept Away"" is somewhere in between.  In some moments, you begin to forget it's Madonna, and believe it's Amber (the character she plays in the film).  In other moments, it sounds like Madonna is reading directly from the script and it comes off terribly.
As for her leading co-star Adrianno as Pepe...he gives an impressive, strong, and commanding performance in the film.  Then again, next to Madonna's acting abilities, who doesn't give such a performance?
The real star in my opinion is the director, Guy Ritchie.  His cinematography alone is breathtaking.  This man had a vision and apparently, making a gorgeous film to look at was part of it.  He mixes in the scenes beautiful, they seem to flow together as the ocean does in the film.  Although his character development is slightly off, that's not truly his fault as he has Madonna as the leading lady of the film.  The directing in this film, his angles, his use of music (a truly perfect soundtrack accompanies this movie) all come together magically.  I can only imagine how pain-staking the editing process must have been for him.  The man is obviously a perfectionist.
Enough has been said about the film to know what its plot consists of.  Thus, I'm not going to go into details about it.  But anyone who says the writing or script in this film is weak is kidding themselves.  The script is incredibly metaphorical, and true.  It challenges opinions regarding men, women, society, and love.  It's sad no one gave the film a chance.
The film gets 3 stars out of 5 (Madonna's acting, minus the last scene in this film where she somewhat shines, brings the movie down), but the DVD special additions make this DVD receive 4 stars.  The additions include a hilarious making-of special, and classic deleted scenes.",1060214400,5,2268,4.831606217616581
1819088,5,B00007L4OE,"I am not the type of person who listens to critics, but because this movie got such bad reviews, and I wasn't particularly interested in the premise of the story anyway (two people stranded on a deserted island? Yeah, sounds great), I didn't rush out to see it. I only hired the DVD the other night because nothing else grabbed my attention at the video store. I was really surprised just how beautiful this film is. I cannot comprehend why critics hated it so much. I can only assume they didn't even watch it! Guy Ritchie is a fantastic director! The dark humour and violence from his first two films are combined here with romance (and a fantastic soundtrack!) to create a truly moving story about two people from different walks of life stranded together and having to confront each other. By the time the credits rolled I had been taken on such a powerful journey that I pretty much watched it again straight away. The first twenty minutes which focusses on a group of rich Americans holidaying on a yacht are so incredibly funny! Ritchie's dark sense of humour is executed superbly. The violence is kept at a minimum, but later in the film there's a potential rape scene which is truly unsettling. Be warned. This contrast in atmosphere might confuse some people, but it is exactly this contrast which makes the film particularly real and effective. The romance which blossoms between Adriano Giannini's character (where has that talented actor been hiding!) and Madonna's character, is just beautiful. The chemistry is perfect. The scenery and photography are also flawless.
I seriously recommend people not to listen to the critics and make their own mind up about this film. It's an utter tragedy that it should be remembered as 'that terrible Madonna film'. What's ironic about Madonna's performance is that everyone thinks the singer is such a materialistic snob, and yet it is in those earlier scenes where she plays exactly this type of person that she seems particularly out of her league. She's not convincing. But when Pepe and Amber become stranded on the island, Madonna simply shines. She gives a truly moving performance as a woman who's view on life undergoes a radical change. She also looks absolutely beautiful throughout! This film really touched me.",1059436800,6,2275,4.881136950904393

I saw this film out of curiosity, because it didn't make it to theaters where I lived.  I enjoy films about being stranded on a deserted island, so I thought this might be worth a look.  As I watched it, I couldn't believe how incredibly bad it is, but I couldn't place my finger on what exactly was so bad about it.  I'm not sure if Guy Ritchie should be blamed for it or Madonna, but something with this movie is off.  With bad acting and a bad plot, this film is probably one of the worst I've ever seen.  On the DVD, the only saving grace is seeing a feature where Guy Ritchie and Madonna interview each other.  I wish that was offered on a separate DVD, because I'd buy that...and I don't want this film in my collection.  Its a film that should have stayed in the private collection of Ritchie/Madonna's home movies.  At the very least, I hope this film kills any chance that Madonna will be given another starring role in any future film project.  She's great in ""Die Another Day"", ""A League of Their Own"", and ""Dick Tracy"" but she can't carry a film (except ""Evita"") on her own.  I hope she sticks with her singing career and forgets about acting.

""Swept Away"" was also filmed beautifully. The last scene was so unexpected, and left a lasting impression.

1819093,5,B00007L4OE,"Despite achieving an extraordinary critically acclaimed career as a pop music artist, a successful acting career has so far eluded Madonna. Applauded for her debut role in Desperately Seeking Susan, subsequent acting roles have been publicly criticised except for a handful of hits (A League of their Own, Evita and Dick Tracy come to mind).
In 2002 Madonna once again performed in a movie, entitled 'Swept Away.' What makes this movie interesting though is that the writer and director is none other than her husband, acclaimed cult film director Guy Ritchie. I'm sure the knives were already out before the first scene was even shot. The critics don't seem to take too kindly to husband/wife filmmaking teams, and the Madonna/Guy combination was no exception.
Before the film hit the cinemas, huge headlines adorned the press proclaiming this movie to be the biggest bomb ever made, so the audiences stayed away in droves. Is this movie really as bad as those critics have suggested?
Even though I'm a Madonna fan I tried to see this film without any preconceived ideas, though I was hoping it would be good - and that hope came true.
The story centres around Amber (played by Madonna) going on a holiday with her rich husband and several socialite friends. Amber is a money obsessed, emotionally surpressed rich woman that we all love to hate. She makes Pepe's (the ship's resident fisherman and all round helper) life miserable.
A turn of events sees Amber and Pepe alone together on a deserted island. It is here where Pepe becomes the 'boss' and Amber must come to grips with being in a situation where money cannot be used to buy whatever she wants.
The first thing one notices about Swept Away is the stunning cinematography of the locations. You can almost reach out and touch that crystal clear water. The DOP and Cinematographer should have been nominated for some award for their talents here.
So for the burning question - how does Madonna perform???? She has shown that she has matured and developed as an actress to give a credible performance as Amber - playing the mean spirited socialite perfectly with a mixture of comedy and pure meanness. When we see Amber show her emotional and sensitive sides, Madonna comes up trumps here also - I had tears in my eyes watching Amber cope with those last remaining moments of the movie.
The DVD itself has some great extras. A 'behind the scenes' featurette actually lives up to it's name - no cheesy self promotional clips here but a true behind the scenes encounter where we see many candid moments between Madonna and Guy, including them with their children. Next is a selection of deleted scenes and the audio commentary with Guy and one of his producers. Whilst divulging the odd interesting fact, it is actually quite tedious to listen to with a considerable amount of umms and aahhhs. He may a brilliant filmmaker but he needs some lessons on how to give good commentary!!!!
I found Swept Away to be a wonderfully tender and romantic movie that reached inside me and tugged at my emotions. It is a shame that audiences have been brainwashed into thinking that this is a bad movie just because Madonna is in it.

Watching the movie, I couldn't help thinking about how she has been blasted, not just for acting performances, but in general.  No law required me to pay money to watch this Madonna DVD -- but there are laws requiring that I help pay for things I don't use (public schools) or want (crop subsidies).  There's no law preventing other entertainers from competing with Madonna, either as singers or actors -- but there are laws strictly limiting competition with the U.S. Postal Service.  Madonna has to provide for her own health care and retirement -- but our national senators/representatives have bestowed upon themselves lavish medical and retirement programs, all funded by us taxpayers.

To be fair, Madonna, like any artist, is subject to criticism.  The book, ""Sex"" and films like ""Shanghai Surprise,"" and ""The Next Best Thing"" were just ill-advised projects that did nothing for her or her talent.
But ""Swept Away"" is the perfect choice for a Madonna film.  Casting Madonna as a middle-aged housewife only shows that Madonna, whose fame and personality has always benefitted from her vanity, is embracing middle-age and is finding parts suited to her age.  I like how Madonna is shot in ""Swept Away"".  There are harsh close-ups, she is not made to look like a goddess, and her hair at the beginning is quite charming.
In fact, I found Madonna's performance to be quite poignant.  I liked how she played the brittle side of her character, and gradually let her guard down throughout the movie.  So many people have complained about how unlikeable the characters were, but I liked how the movie did not gloss over the less glamorous side of the characters, and allowed them to be seen in less flattering lights.  After all, passionate romances verge from love to hate, and this movie certainly showed that.
Madonna seems to be at another low point in a career of mostly highs (this is probably the worst its been since the post-""Sex"" phase).  I think the criticism being directed towards her at the current time is mostly unwarranted.  And I hope that in years to come, ""Swept Away,"" like the 1980 film ""Heaven's Gate"" will be rediscovered and re-examined again.",1052697600,2,1686,4.66554054054054

It was mildly entertaining, but it wasn't great at all. Madonna can't really act all that well, and needs to stick to her day job. She was great in ""A League of Their Own"", but in this particular film, you could tell she was trying really hard to make the best of it, but it just didn't work. The script by Ritchie was full of unbelievably corny scenes and bits of dialogue. The scene where Giancarlo Gianni and Madonna play charades in the cabin by the beach is unbearable...
Other than all of that, the scenery is beautiful, and like I said, its mildy entertaining...enough so that you can make it through the entire film. BARELY make it through, rather.

1819107,1,B00007L4OE,"Based on the 1974 film, SWEPT AWAY is scripted by director Guy Ritchie. How could he? Based on SNATCH and LOCK, STOCK... I was under the impression that the man had TALENT. There's no evidence of that anywhere in this movie.
Madonna plays Amber Leighton, a snotty, spoilt social climber who ends up having to take a look at herself when she is shipwrecked on a deserted island (they always are) with a lowly crewmate Peppe (Andriano Giannini). They bicker and fight and gradually, guess what happens next... but they don't have to worry about starving because there's no shortage of turkeys on this island.
SWEPT AWAY makes BLUE LAGOON (the Brooke Shields version)and even its sequel, look GOOD.
Of all Madonna's movies the only two she was good in were DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN and EVITA. Here she tries to be taken seriously by bravely showing off her wrinkles to the world. She also demonstrates her astounding acting range by bitching and moaning while smoking a cigarillo and riding an exercycle simultaneously. Dustin Hoffman eat your heart out.
Is SWEPT AWAY meant to be comedy? Drama? A soap opera? In any case, Madonna and Ritchie should be paying US to watch it (Though even Ritchie has admitted this is an awful movie). This is one of those movies where you feel like you've been watching for half an hour but when you check the clock counter on your DVD/VHS only ten minutes have passed. However, if you've always wanted to see Madonna on her knees grovelling and being slapped across the face this might be money well spent.
Extras (which are mildly more interesting that the film) include commentaries by Ritchie and the producer, a behind the scenes feature with Madonna and Ritchie interviewing each other, subtitles and deleted scenes. Save your money, unless you're a die hard Madonna fan. On the other hand, Ritchie's fans (myself included) would probably like to forget this movie even exists.",1051142400,7,1914,4.856269113149847

The film is directed with style and wit by Guy Ritchie, one of the most underappreciated directors today.  While some of the film is difficult, like Pepe constantly slapping Amber, I applaud Ritchie and Madonna for making such a risky and indie-feeling picture.  I am tired of the same old romantic comedy, and this is a R.C. with some bite.  This film is definately worth a look.",1051142400,2,746,4.369565217391305
1819109,3,B00007L4OE,"I have to agree with other reviews of this film and join the chorus of ""It's not the worst movie I have ever seen."" It's also not a bad performance by Madonna. I think unfortunately this movie was swirled with controversy (remaking a CLASSIC foreign film with politicial and feminist messges, lawsuits from another star who said HE wanted to remake the film with Madonna first, and Guy Ritchie directing his wife, and of course, Madonna's acting ability) before it was even made. When it came out, people were just downright MEAN. I would have loved to have seen it on the big screen, but it never opened here due to the bad press.
When you think about all the clunkers that many popular actors or actresses make, why does everyone act like it's the end of the world when Madonna makes less that a 5 star film. Isn't she entitled to some fun as an actress? Does it all have to be EVITA? I, for one, loved her performance in WHO'S THAT GIRL? I think it's a funny film and a good time.
I think SWEPT AWAY is a hoot. It's not brain surgery, but it's not meant to be. I agree that Madonna is over the top in the beginning, but during the subtle scenes later in the film, she is very convincing and dare I say, powerful. I think the film is a must own for a Madonna fan and the MTV special with Madonna and Guy is TOO CUTE.

The director Guy Ritchie made some revisions to the original script, like cutting down some of the violent female abuse which was a lot in the original film but cut down in this movie, which i think was ok since i don't think the American audience can stomach all the physical and verbal abuse that the female character had to endure in this film.  And i liked the ending, the ending of the original film was very depressing to me, with this remake, It was still a sad ending but you would somehow be relieved that it's not her fault after all...

Madonna looked like death warmed over. The story was something Saturday Night Live wouldn't touch. She had zero sex appeal and it seemed to have rubbed off on her Italian hottie. I kept hoping that he'd at least have some nude scenes. This theme is really as old as the hills. Cecil B. DeMille did this way back in l918 with Gloria Swanson and Thomas Meighan in ""Male and Female"". At least you had some real passion and energy. In this one, you watched Madonna and her new Italian boy toy smooching on the beach with waves crashing over them. I remember watching a promo for this dud on Entertainment Tonight and it showed madonna's husband, Guy Richie, watching the couple smooching on the beach and he kept screaming ""cut! cut!"" and then he turned to the camera to laugh and wink. As if we viewers were watching something naughty. Yawn. Bore. Ugh. Madonna just doesn't have any juice when she's on the screen. She wasted it all away on all those musical videos she did centuries ago. ""Swept Away"" did sweep away my insomnia.",1047340800,7,1193,4.502304147465438

Madonna isn't distractingly bad; and the relationship her character developes with the male lead is interesting and complex.  The film never drags, and the scenery is gorgeous.

1819125,4,B00007L4OE,"Richard Roper called Swept Away ""the worst film of 2002."" That was before I saw the movie so then I couldn't judge it. Eberts worst movie I'm fighting with but that is not for this reveiw.(Death to Smoochy was a geat movie.) I didn't think I would even get to see Swept Away. The movie didn't even make a million dollars in cash at the box office so when a small local video store got it I was shocked but glad. I have been wanting to get to see that film for sometime after reading the horrible reveiw for it on Ebert and Roeper at the Movies. I watched it and decided in two simple words ""not bad."" I didn't think it was horrible but most critics probally compared it to the orignal Swept Away. I'll have to see that and get to that later on in life. Swept Away was funny at times but I felt that the premise has been used to death. Getting stranded on a deserted island was funny with Gilligans Island but enough is enough. How about something different for a change. Like getting stranded at sea. There is something that I feel hasn't been done to death and it is interesting. Another ""Swept"" flaw is that it just took a really long time to get into it. They got stranded on the island after the first half hour was over and then got off it forty five minutes later. It's not a long film either. At a cool 88 minutes according to my DVD player ""Swept Away"" is a bumpy ride but thank goodness for me that bumpy ride doesn't last for the entire film.
Madonna is the star. Why? She is not that great an actress from what I have seen. Actually to me her best work to date is probally The Next Best Thing. She was alright in this but I considering Madonna as a better singer then she is an actress. No offenise Madonna. In the film she plays Amber. A rich, snotty, women who with her husband Anthony chartered a boat with a few of there friends. There friends include Debi,Mike Marina,and Todd. All couples they are traveling from Greece to Italy. The boat's crew cannot be more nicer to the couples but of course these rich people see the crew as there ""lesser class."" But Amber is always angry at fisherman Giusseppe played by Adriano Giannini the son of the director of the orignal Swept Away. Giusseppe is likewise always ticked off at amber and is tired to her calling him names like ""PePe."" The captain tells him to grin a bear it and that the vaction will be over soon. But when Amber makes him ferry her to a cave where they are going to meet her friends. He doesn't want to go to long distance but does and in the middle of the ocean the motor stops working and the boat capsizes. They land on an island and when Giusseppe looks around he finds out that there is nobody on the island. Since she can't hunt she finds out that she needs him to survive but he forces her to become his ""slave"" when he finds out. He makes her endure the same kind of treatment that she made him have. Of course if you spend enough time when someone you eventually fall in love with them which is exactly what happens between the two main characters in Swept Away. They must decide what they are going to do in the future and how they both feel about the opposite one. From the moment there feet touched that island their lives were both Swept Away.
I enjoyed Swept Away, I really did. It wasn't a great movie that I have seen this year like Adaptation,25th Hour, or About Schimdt but it was enjoyable. But comparing remakes to the orignal ones is something that I am against because they are both different forms of art. You can't compare two different thing.

Remake or not, this movie could have been made without the physical abuse.  And it would have been an excellent opportunity to show true heroism--a man who's man enough NOT to hit a woman who's treated him badly.  It's a shame.  The actor is so handsome, too.  But that shot his character's appeal all to heck.  Hopefully, his next role will be more heroic.
As for Madonna, I'm surprised that such as strong woman would appear in such a demeaning role.  Unfortunately, her character didn't grow much in the end.  If she had, she would have been strong enough to figure out how to fix her marriage or else get out.  Instead, she wimped out.  Where did all that octopus-spearing strength go?

However, not only does Madonna's acting improve throughout the movie, but the film traps the viewer, makes the viewer cry, and most importantly, makes the viewer think about the values in our society.

1819155,2,B00007L4OE,"I have been a huge Madonna fan for years. I have every album and have seen most movies. And still, I have yet to have a good experience watching a ""Madonna movie"". She's truly awful in most of them and just mediocre in a few. And while she is still better in this movie than before, she is not good or at all impressive. She is simply incapable of acting and relating to other people on screen. She's a distant, cold presence and I guess that makes sense because she has been such an electrifying solo performer for years.
But really, what would she have to work with here, anyway? No, the film is not as bad as other people have said. And it's certainly not the worst movie of the year (Anybody else catch ""Death to Shmoochie?""). But it has not point, no true reason to exist. The script is cring-worthy and Guy Ritchie, who actually has cinematic talent, is certainly slumming here.
There's a fantasy scene half-way through the movie that shows Madonna dancing and lip-synching ""Come On a My House"" to the camera. The scene has no point and is uncomfortably out of place, but for one fleeting minute we get to see Madonna in her element. It's just her and the camera.

Despite the bad reviews when it was released, it is actually a pretty good movie (!) - I wish critics would have given it the chance that it deserved.
I will admit, Madonna isn't the greatest actress ever, but she does make an effort.  (Why doesn't Guy help her more - that's what I can't figure out). Her showmanship really shows through in the dream sequence in the yellow dress - that was great! Once again Guy displays his unique film-making style.  And... Madonna LOOKS great in the movie - what yoga can do for you!  It's also a great story and it has a message.
The extras are nice, too - some deleted scenes and a ""Making of.""  I enjoyed the ""Making of"" - got to see Madonna interview Guy - it's so cute how he calls her Mrs. Ritchie and you also get to see the whole family playing around - Madonna, Guy, Lourdes and little Rocco.  You can tell Guy just adores Rocco to pieces.

1819158,4,B00007L4OE,"I've seen the movie twice in theater and rushed to get my own dvd copy after that!!!  It was released here in the Philippines relatively late ( just this week ), and had no plans of watching it because of the bad reviews.  I didn't have plans two days ago, and my friends convinced me to see it.  Now, I'm a big Madonna fan but not so much where acting is concerned ( she was great though in Evita and A League Of Their Own, but really lousy in Next Best Thing ).  After seeing it, I couldn't believe how much the critics trashed this film!!!  How could they?!  They obviously hate Madonna!  She acted decently, if not good.  I think the press insults her art and her intelligence as an actress.  That is how she thought the character should be portrayed and she did just that.  Obviously they have a strong idea on how the role should be done.  They must be really good actors, huh?!!!  I want to see them do the role so we'd really know their credibility as critics!  I wonder how they could eat from money they earned from trashing people?
  The movie was refreshing to see.  Madonna was great.  She made me hate her character in the first half of the film  but got my sympathy by the second half.  That is how an actress should make her audience feel.  She was terribly funny  and at the same time remarkably human. I could never think of any actress who could play this part as intelligently as she did.  Adriano Giannini was intense in his portrayal and painfully handsome.  How could anyone resist this man?  Madonna and Giannini's chemistry was like a little slice of paradise.  The movie had me in tears by the time it ended.  I wish Mr. Guy Ritchie would make a sequel.
  The film was also beautifully photographed.  The cinematography, spectacular!!!  It made me want to see this part of the world and be swept away.  The rest of the cast, plus that hot Italian guy (or was he Greek) with no speaking lines, were more than adequate.  All in all this movie got less that what it truly deserved.

Madonna does a fantastic job as portraying this snobby, mean-spirited rich wife and once she's stranded on the island, you eventually get to see her character grow as a human being which is always good. Adriano's character is an enjoyable one and his chemistry with Madonna works great. Also I want to mention that her female costars in the beginning of the film (Jeanne Tripplehorn & I'm unsure of the younger blonde actress's name) were colorful characters as well. Madonna is constantly slammed by certain critics and wrongfully they ganged up on her for this one as well. The movie also does not have a typical Hollywood ending but I did have to give the movie only 3 stars because the ending did feel a little rushed and I definitely wanted more.

1819171,3,B00007L4OE,"When ""Swept Away"" was released in American theaters last fall it was savaged by critics and dubbed one of the biggest  flops of the year. It is important to remember that ""Swept Away"" was never intended by Guy Ritchie and company to have the same box office as ""Spiderman"". ""Swept Away"" is basically a vacation picture for Guy Ritchie and wife Madonna, it was not intended to win any oscars. The budget was quite small, so nobody lost money...unlike say Eddie Murphy's ""Pluto Nash"" which cost 100 million, and only took in 15 million.
The movie is not nearly as bad as say ""Ishtar"" or ""Shangi Surprise"" that being said it is still not a great cinematic masterpiece. Much has been said about Madonna's performence, that she was wooden and simply cannot act (she is better than Ben Afflect any day!), which is not true. In the first third of the film, she does quite well as Amber, a spoiled American, who is the wife of a pharmaceutical big shot. She is rude, ignorant, and petulant, I have dealt with many a woman like this and Madonna does a great job here. The supporting cast does a good job here too, giving us an idea of Amber world as well as the ships mate fisherman Pepe (Adriano Gianini)-who also does a decent job here in his first English speaking role.
In the remainder of the film, Madonna's quasi English accent appears (which is odd here, well it is always odd..) since she is supposed to be American here. She is a tad unanimated once Amber and Pepe are rescued, which may be the fault of Richie's script and direction-other directors have gotten better performences out of Madonna (Penny Marshall, Warren Beatty).
That being said, the film is beautiful to look at. Ritchie choice of Malta as a film location was well selected, as it is one of the most breathtakingly stunning films to watch. Madonna also looks stunning here, even sans makeup, all those years of yoga, a vegetarian diet, and clean living have paid off here! Gianini is also, while unkempt, quite fit and pairs nicely with Madonna, though in the fight scenes I think Madonna could beat the pants off of him, her biceps are bigger than his.
All in all the film is worth watching, the small budget shows, Ritchie's script could have used more polish, but it is worth viewing, with an open mind. Viewers may be pleasently surprised that this film is much better than the press said.
The DVD is a great value: it features the film, 16 deleted scenes, The Making of Swept Away special, and trailers.

In the beginning, she is a bit wooden, but I think part of that was an intentional reflection of the character.

Madonna does give the most believable performance of her career as Amber.  Amazon[.com] does, however, say that the movie fails at making a valid point of the economics of capitalism, and this may be the case.  I, though, did not watch this movie as a statement on capitalism, but as a love story.  The style of the movie does change over and over again, and this is the only real flaw.

She's not a great actress yet, but she has her moments when she fully inhabits her character and is quite touching. People really have a hard time seeing beyond her persona. You may not want to run out and buy this one, if you haven't seen it yet, but at least rent it and decide for yourself.",1042416000,12,676,4.459677419354839

1819186,3,B00007L4OE,"Alright, first thing I'm going to do is establish my credibility. Yes, I have been a Madonna fan since 1983 and NO I do not think everything she makes is fantastic which I find annoying and cultish (you know, that glazed eyed look of her fanatic fans.) In fact, she's put out some real doozies (ahem... ""Next Best Thing"" anyone? What garbage!) Plus, I hated her album ""Music"" so this is to let you know I'm trying to be a fair viewer.
Okay, the movie. Well, I watched it out of morbid curiosity. I had heard so much bad stuff about this movie I just really wanted to see why it was so horrible. You know what? It wasn't that bad.
The storyline was somewhat interesting... fascinating really... take two opposite persons with different morals and values that defy the other and put each one in a place of power over the other and watch what happens. It is somewhat masochistic in a sense. In other words, it really is a clashing of personal values and  defying them until the other gets fed up. The lower class Italian worker simply rebels more and more when he is being dominated by Amber... interestingly enough, Amber, the rich nasty woman, submits completely when she is in the passive position. She really doesn't even fight. Why? Because her place of power really is an illusion whereas his isn't.
Regardless, all philosophical musings aside, you probably want the dirt on the flick. Alright, it's totally Guy all the way when it comes to filming and directing. You get his humor and camera angles from ""Lock, Stock..."" So if you liked that movie, you might get a kick out of this one.
How was Madonna? Not bad. She was actually interesting in her character. She's starting to really loosen as an actress and beginning to forget the camera. Remember, I said BEGINNING.
She's getting there. Also, it seems like she trusts her husband as a director so she relaxes a bit. She delivers her lines softer, but without as much emotion in the first half of the film. I truly believe Madonna should take acting lessons. She's too conscious of the camera and we as the audience are too conscious of the most famous woman in the world. And she's aware of this.
Is this a problem? Yes, mostly due to the fact that she has a HUGE obstacle to overcome in order for her audience to believe her as an actress; she has to make her audience forget who she is in order for them to like her character that she's portraying. She did this 100% in ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" and 75% in ""Evita.""
If she took lessons in acting, like she did with singing, I think she could go somewhere. Otherwise, her marketable product is what's truly knocking her down. What an amazing contradition!
Otherwise, the film was interesting. The scenery was just beautiful, especially the nighttime scenes. There are moments between the two main characters that are genuinely fun and tender. I liked the interaction between the two of them and how loving they are towards each other. The ending (Spoiler)  is truly sad which makes it more of an art film than a blockbuster movie.  However, you can tell it was put together rather quickly and could have used more polishing.  Not a waste, but not that bad.
Still, I plan on renting it when it comes out. I wouldn't mind looking at it again. Recommendations: big bang viewers, don't bother -- it's more of an insight to an artflick, something to chat about.",1041811200,32,3367,4.5787728026534

It got bad reviews even when it was still being filmed.  In my opinion, it's a GOOD movie.  It's not spectacular.  It's not a blockbuster that everyone in Hollywood is trying to make.  It's about romance vs. social classes.  It's got a good message and I think it deserves to be seen.  It's slighly off from the original which was more politically charged.  The best scene is the fantasy sequence where the real Madonna comes out.  It's worth seeing just for that scene.  And Madonna's looking hot in a bikini throughout the whole film.

Me and my wife could not see it on the big screen on opening weekend and made plans for the following week.  What IDIOTS! took it off the screen before it had a chance, is beyond me.  Now I have to wait for the DVD ( and there had better be one soon ) to watch it.  I'm sure many people will agree with me on this one.  Modanna, I will pay you personally if you can make me a DVD.

1819191,4,B00007L4OE,"Despite the critic's obvious bias towards Madonna on the big screen, this movie is really a lot of fun. It was getting slammed before anyone even saw it or a screening. I have to agree with Entertainment Weekly's review and give it a B or 4 stars out of 5.
Madonna is completely convincing as the rich, arrogant Amber who always gets her way and goes out of her way to torture her servant and costar Adriano Giannini. After the two are stranded on a deserted island, the fun begins and the power falls to her servant who can hunt and supply food. It is rather fun to what Madonna get slapped around.
The cinematography is also well done and the Mediterranean setting plays perfect. Over all, this movie really is funny and fun to watch. If people try to take it too seriously then they will and can find flaws, its not perfect. So, let your guard down, ignore the critics and see it yourself!",1036800000,3,892,4.379518072289157

Having conquered Hollywood once and for all, Mrs. R can now rest on her (finally acknowledged) film laurels and concentrate her ineffable talents on her gift of song, or perhaps the Kabballah (sorry if I muffed the spelling, dear).

1819193,4,B00007L4OE,"As much as I second-guessed seeing this movie, I am a fan of Madonna and wanted to check it out.  Perhaps since I was predisposed to be disappointed, I came away thinking that the film was not very bad at all.  The film is not Oscar material, but it is not a torture to watch.  I cannot believe how heavily the film has been trashed.  The scenery is great.  Madonna is beautiful albeit noticeably mature in some shots. But, in most shots she looks as attractive as ever and her body is always beautiful.  The fact that it may not be perfect enough for some plays into the role she is playing in this film.
The theme of the movie is not a popular one (anti-capitalist & anti-materialism.) Many of the critics claimed that this theme was too subtle and somewhat unclear as compared to the original. This really makes me wonder what the hell they could have been thinking.  It could not have been more obvious.
The movie shows the fallacy of a woman that charges her self-esteem by using money as a tool of belittling others.  She has made the mistake of feeling that her money (or rather her husbands) results in some type of accomplishment over others.  She badgers and emasculates the shipmates (in a humorous way that only a ""bitchy"" diva could do).  Eventually, the tables are turned and she is forced to play the role of a submissive and humiliated person.
Getting a taste of her own medicine forces her to come to terms with the vulnerability that she feels by being an aging woman.  Her anger and rudeness comes from living in a society where her wisdom, beauty and knowledge must take a backseat to whimsical 19 year olds with fewer wrinkles and whose like of wisdom and intelligence is often seen as a desirable characteristic among men.  Perhaps, the role of her husband could have had more texture.  At the same time, the emptiness of his character combined with his last minute conniving shows the viewer what type of world the ""rich"" characters live.  The film does not have a Hollywood ending.
The film is humorous, and it is also quite sad at times.  All in all, the film was enjoyable and I recommend it to fans and people that don't mind thinking a bit while they are being entertained.  The direction was awesome, but it is not the Wham Bam rollercoaster ride that we have seen in other films by Ritchie.",1035676800,6,2320,4.501193317422435

 WHAT IS ANNOYING IS  the trashy critics,very exagerating in makin a flop of this one ,i guess just because of the actress madonna,personnally she is one of the best actress which took her job seriously ,keeping it evolutive ,while i see none of the actresses doing so well artistically speaking,even julia roberts and not only her,almost knows how madonna is a threat to her careers,madonna is the girl who stops at nothing with or whithout critics. IN fact work of most hollywood actresses is bad choices and even .....BUT WE KEEP IT DOWN sayin that.
SOME think that really bothered me is some real bad reviewers of newspapers making remarkes about the look of madonna,the ageing skin ,apparent veines ON HER ARMS and so..WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSE TO  MEAN?and what relation to the movie?plus she's shinnig there!
I RECOMEND TO FOLLOW YOURS INSTINCT,for me it worked also for many in my entourage,""guy you are a talented fella,thanks""
I have no issues with this happy couple,the choice of livin outside america,or that the director ritchie isn't american ,the critics just want to shake this happy familly,well let them know that life isn't based on movie or a golden statuette,madonna will not be a victim as mariah she herself knows,that why she says about it:MISERY LOVES COMPANY",1034985600,,1752,4.989726027397261

It does have some weaknesses. I actually enjoy this movie. I don't think they gave Madonna enough credits for trying hard and indeed made some improvement in acting. She gives a credible and convincing performance and she actually does a better job than in ""Evita."" At least that is how I feel.
Her performance here (the first half) is quite similar to the one she did for BMW ""The Hire"" series. If anyone hasn't seen that short film ""Star"" directed by her husband Guy Ritchie, check out on the Season 1. She did a good comic job there. (Yes, she plays a spoiled star and as easy as it sounds, no, acting is not easy.)
A lot of people are going to dislike this movie because it's so ""unAmerican,"" just as much as they will find other European movies bewildering and unsettling, for example, ""La Pianiste.""
The tone of the film changes after 1/2 of it and it just got better. The chemistry between Madonna and the handsome leading man Adriano Giannini is infectious and only makes her transformation more convincing. Adriano does a wonderful job and especially to the end. The ending does make my eyes wet. It's entertaining and that is what I want from my $.",1034726400,,1324,4.4979253112033195
1819197,4,B00007L4OE,"All too often film critics will bash a movie simply because of a person who is in it.  Swept Away was called ""a leading contender for a Razzie"" (the anti-Oscar) before it even opened.  I hope those people actually go see the movie because they will be surprised.
This movie is not perfect.  Parts are very ""Taming of the Shrew""-esque.  I would have given more time developing the transition from ""Amber the ..."" to ""Amber the Nice"".  And there was one scene where Giuseppe and Amber are on a lift that is pretty cheesy.
HOWEVER, the rest of the cinematography was wonderful.  Madonna played the part beautifully, and in my eyes, redeemed herself after ""The Next Best Thing"".  Adriano Giannini was simply amazing...I'm sure we'll be seeing more of him in Hollywood.  The story was fast-moving, interesting, and fun.  This movie is well-deserving of four stars.
I highly recommend this movie, but just remember:
1)  Don't compare it to the original ""Swept Away...""  This is an adaptation for 2002.  It's not meant to be like the original.
