I'm convinced that the positive reviews were written by the three guys associated with producing, writing, directing and acting in this trainwreck. Actually, I would have enjoyed a trainwreck much more than the two hours I spent trying to see if this farce would go anywhere... and I mean anywhere.",1398124800,,388,4.893939393939394
8190882,1,B000PDZRQY,"So wanted it to be good.  It was unwatchable.  I tried twice to watch it, but just couldn't get past the first 1/2 hour",1353369600,,119,3.9166666666666665
8190883,1,B000PDZRQY,"Yeah, not a very good movie.  The actors were not good and too old for the parts they are paying and if you're looking for something hot and sexy just keep looking.  There are a lot better low budget movies out there",1341705600,2,216,4.119047619047619
8190884,1,B000PDZRQY,"What a waste of time! It's hard to believe that there are people, who enjoyed this piece of sh***t. I don't know what is worse: acting or the story...or the dull music. If you want to take a revange on somebody, make them watch this something.
Avoid by all means!",1341446400,,263,4.28
8190885,1,B000PDZRQY,I got this movie as I thought the others' reviews were good.  But the Acting was very poor.  It was an extremely amateur film. I don't think it was worth the money (14.95) paid for.  I'm confused why the reviews were so high.,1332115200,2,225,4.186046511627907
8190886,4,B000PDZRQY,"I must admit after reviewing the trailer of this film I was a little skeptical to watch the entire movie. However, after reviewing the film my perceptions were completely altered. This movie was complex at times and a little hard to understand, however, watching the lives of these two people, and seeing the obstacles they faced were very relatable to real life. Many gay people are confused and often ashamed of their feelings in today's society, as was Michael in this film. Many people feel as though they should act as if are someone else. There is lots of envy, and suspicion present in the film. Julia and Michael face many struggles throughout the film. The characters battle with not only life issues but also with the will to survive. The acting in the film was impressive. From a feminist point of view, I enjoyed the movie. I was not offended by any of the topics in the film. It is hard to realize that many women rely on their promiscuity to survive.  The movie actually broadened my horizons and helped me to thing outside the box. I have also realized how hard it may be for someone to disclose who they truly are. I would recommend this film to viewers who would like to embark upon a journey, and open their eyes to different ways of life. This film will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you yearning for just a little more.",1210723200,13,1353,4.455645161290323
