8396233,4,B003FTM1M8,"In director Clint Eastwood's SPACE COWBOYS (2000), four now-geriatric ex-astronauts finally get a chance go into space. Their mission: repair the outmoded guidance system on an old Soviet satellete, a unit too big to be lassoed by the space station.

The revived Team Daedalus crew: Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Jim Garner and Donald Sutherland. Their hated NASA boss is James Cromwell. NASA flight director: William Devane. Marcia Gay Harden is an engineer who falls for Tommy Lee. Younger backup crew includes Courtney Vance and Loren Dean.

Jay Leno cameos as himself. He does an ad lib TONIGHT Show interview with the four old men of space.

Industrial Light & Magic (George Lucas) supplies some impressive CGI that are somewhat
spoiled by a variety of rocket noises and other explosions in the vacuum of space.",1415318400,,813,5.052238805970149
8396234,5,B003FTM1M8,"This film has a great premise and starts out brilliantly and only falters just a bit in the third act. Clint Eastwood, James Garner, Donald Sutherland and Tommy Lee Jones are very good. However, Tommy Lee Jones looks about 15 years too young to be from the same era as the other three. Yet, I felt Jones came off the best and his character truly comes to an endearing end, which makes up for a lot in this film. All considered the camaraderie these four actors have really comes across and saves the day making the film really enjoyable. The animosity between James Cromwell and Clint Eastwood is central too the premise of this film and that also is enjoyable as it harkens back to the days when Dirty Harry bucked the system run by self-absorbed bureaucrats. As with most newer films, this Blu-ray version looks very good.",1414713600,,824,4.574324324324325
