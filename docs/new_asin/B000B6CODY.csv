2403040,5,B000B6CODY,"My favorite TV show ever.

Yes, I admit it.

Love this season, tied with the 3rd season.

But, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED BY THE DVD PACKAGE.

No booklet with information on the episodes.  THIS SEASON DOES NOT EVEN HAVE 1 EPISODE THAT HAS A CELEBRITY GUEST STARS NAME IN THE ""SMALL"" WRITE UP FOR THE EPISODE.

1ST SEASONS DVD PACKAGE HAD SOME OF THE GUEST STARS NAMED, THIS SEASON NOTHING.

No extras on this seasons's DVD package as well.

Very disappointed with the DVD package.",1131753600,9,476,4.517647058823529
2403041,5,B000B6CODY,"The 1st season was great but the 2nd season is even better! As one reviewer said, this is the Partridge Family I remember.

The 2nd season gives you the 2nd Chris (Brian Forster), groovier music, funnier situations and Shirley Jones in hot pants (""The Undergraduate"" - check her out!).

The Partridge Family - Seasons 1 & 2 are a must have! If Sony releases the 3rd & 4th seasons, I'll buy those too!

The songs from ""Sound Magazine"" and ""Shopping Bag"" were the best collections of songs from the seven LP'S released.

You couldn't go wrong. And they didn't.

The hampsters, Dora, Chris and Tracy running away to Reubens...I could go on.

I'm so happy this is about to be released on DVD.

2403043,4,B000B6CODY,"Being a kid is hard, and being a very successful rock group would be even harder, but the Partridge Family continued to pull an amazing balancing act throughout 24 episodes of the 1971-1972. By now the David Cassidy bubble-gum machine was in full force, but the Partridge Family remained a family show which treated all ensemble characters.

First up, Keith has to confront the truth about a girl's singing in ""Dora, Dora, Dora"", smitten with a guests beauty he does not want to admit that she cannot sing until ultimately hearing a tape for himself. He has another humbling experience during ""In 25 words or less"" because the winner of a teen magazine contest ultimately turns out to be 60-year old Gloria Neugast, (Kay Medford) not exactly the woman of his dreams.  Gloria is initially nice, but she ends up driving the family nuts with her habits---and briefly continues this in a letter from her new home

And that's the other part of this sitcom's charm. These international rock stars are a suburban family also prone to many of the other emotional experiences their audiences (in `concert' and home viewing) are most likely to have. For all of the success this family still enjoys, they play intimate venues and continue living in their home.

During ""Anatomy of a tonsil"" Danny has to get his tonsils taken out and is scared. Because he was so convinced that he would die from the procedure, he is genuinely shocked when he wakes up. However he is convinced that he cannot sing with his family anymore because his throat is sore immediately post-op. Danny continues believing this until his family uses a little reverse psychology upon him to encourage him rejoining the group; best friend Punky Lazar himself is recruited as Danny's `replacement'.

Keith tries to replace the `father figure' after receiving Coach Dawson's advice about being the eldest male in ""Dr Jekyll and Mr. Partridge"". He has good intentions, but Keith does not realize that if he was not interested in attending `cultural events' at Chris, Tracy, and Danny's age (let alone now) they were not that keen either. Keith finally realizes that all of this parenting does not leave him with the time needed to complete his homework.  The other Partridge kids also apologize for having gotten back at Keith.

Another mishap occurs with ""A tale of two hamsters"". Danny, Chris, and Tracy's hamster-raising business collides with the reality of touring. The Partridges cannot find a hotel which will accommodate lots of hamsters. Danny thinks giving a hamster away with the newest Partridge Family album will help alleviate things, but does not forecast how much work it is going to be in order to meet consumer demand.

Like many other families, the Partridge kids squabble, but they ultimately attempt to care about each other.  During ""Days of acne and roses"", Danny realizes the grocery store delivery boy Wendell has a large crush on Laurie. Rather than discouraging the `nerd' from dating his sister, Danny and Keith help him with dating tips and gaining confidence. Their lessons work great because he ends up going on a dream date, also getting attention from other young women. Laurie then becomes concerned that Wendell will ask her to go steady, but he confides that he would like to play the field instead.

Rob Reiner guest star in ""A man called Snake"". Because a young biker man camps out after Keith blabs incorrect information about his sister's love life to a teen magazine, this is one of the creepier shows. Laurie ultimately goes to the dance with him after initially being weirded out by the attention. This is one of the episodes which (despite the famous guest star) does not hold up well. The family seems unaware that the `sensitive poet' could actually harm Laurie.

The family has better luck when they pick up a hitchhiker named Jenny (Merideth Baxter Birney) during ""Where do mermaids go"".  She seems nice enough, but when she leaves a bank book containing one million after a few days at their house, Shirley becomes suspicious. She thinks that the money could have been stolen. As it turns out, the money really was Jenny's to give, but the Partridge family was ultimately happiest being a suburban family who happened to travel with a psychedelic bus.

Finally, Ray Bolger (the Scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz) guest stars as Grandpa Fred Renfrew in ""The fourty-year itch"".  Wanting to live a more youthful life, Grandpa shows up at his daughter's house just as the Partridges are about to begin yet another tour. Things heat up when Grandma arrives, but everything is nicely resolved at the end of the story.

This series is a must for anybody wanting to take a super groovy return trip down memory lane.",1127174400,42,4710,4.855361596009975

2403052,5,B000B6CODY,"This is the best season of all the Partridge Family episodes -- David Cassidy wasn't exhausted and stifled by the series yet; the characters had found their niche, the ""new"" Chris of Brian Forster was a much more appealing little boy than Jeremy Gelbwaks' popping Dondi eyes and squeaked ""Who?"", and Susan Dey had grown into her role as a sarcastically funny sister who doesn't take crap from the boys.  Best of all, the interaction between Keith and Danny is howlingly funny -- Keith is a vain, if well-meaning, small-town celebrity and local high school heart-throb, taken down more than a few notches by Danny's greedy plots and schemes to one-up everyone and make money.  Their caustic exchanges are priceless.  Also, Reuben Kincaid is less the put-upon, jaded middle-aged manager than a genuine family friend looking after his clients' interests.  He and Shirley have a believable-to-viewers platonic fondness for one another and adult empathy among a passel of youngsters, almost like having a friendly divorced stepdad around who still really gets along with mom.

I've read here mild criticisms that the second season just turned into another ""living room comedy"" of the 1970's, but at age 10-11, we wanted to see our idols act like normal young people, going to school and having friends of their own age, not always being perfect and popular, teenagers Keith and Laurie having occasional awkwardness on dates or a rival at high school giving them a hard time.  Instead of nightclubbing around the country, the band (with more obvious David Cassidy-Shirley Jones vocals than the previous season's lip-synching to the vocals of the Behlar brothers and Jackie Ward) now just tour in the summertime, or play local venues around town or in nearby communities on weekends -- festivals, fairs, club fund-raisers.  It makes their characters a little more down-to-earth instead of flashy Las Vegas performers.  Viewers can (almost) believe a family of entertainers with bickering siblings and pretty realistic problems -- Danny's even doing 1970's jr high bad things by the third season like shoplifting, even though none of the kids went anywhere near drugs.  But it's made pretty obvious Keith is already romantically, perhaps sexually, experienced by his last year in high school -- which was typical for the era.  Trust me.

It's still puzzling about poor little Chris and Tracy -- Mom barely acknowledges them except to order them to go to bed or to finish their dinner, and has no physical affection at all for them -- Danny's hugged and kissed and called ""honey"" and ""sweetheart"" by his mom a lot more than the two youngest, and especially a little girl between 4-5 years old like Tracy's character still needs a lot of cuddling from her Mommy.  But, once more, the little kids are ciphers who mutely follow Danny around or sit and watch while he teases Keith.  Laurie has absolutely no interest at all in her little sister whom she still shares a bedroom with and doesn't even address her by name, yet she tousles Danny's hair, hugs him, playfully insults him and interacts with him.  Chris can spout some lines and be a sidekick to Danny's mischief occasionally, but not much else.  Keith doesn't even know his youngest siblings are alive, except for the episode when he attempts to be the man-of-the-family father figure, and even then, it's all interaction with Danny.  I suspect even the real actors on the show barely paid any attention to these little kids while they were working on the set.

But, again, this is the best season with the funniest episodes:  Danny (with Chris's aide) stealing Keith's personal belongings, including his hair, and selling them to besotted local teenyboppers; Keith getting his own ""bachelor"" apartment at the next-door neighbors' and being miserably exploited by both Danny's greed (""These aren't potato chips!  This is potato dust!"") and enslavement to the neighbor's yardwork  (""I feel like a sharecropper!"" Keith spits in realistic anger as he clips the hedges.)  Everyone loves the not-too-cutsey Christmas show.  Then there was the howl of Shirley and Laurie going overnight camping at a nearby park, a worried Reuben, Keith and Danny following them with absolutely no provisions but Keith's guitar and a suitcase full of underwear.  The very best episode is the one about the gossipy article series Danny writes for the local San Pueblo Sunday newspaper's magazine section, luridly lascivious ""tell-alls"" about Keith and Shirley which invokes their wrath and results in them being the brunt of the community's hilarious derision.  This second season was still good clean family fun, but didn't patronize ""with-it"" 1970's viewers of any generation. . .. and by the third season, the show was understandably starting to run out of steam, and should have been cancelled while it was still a top draw, instead of the dreadful fourth season with the irritating little neighbor boy screaming nursery songs in every episode.  We were in junior high by then, had outgrown the Partridge Family, and avoided watching the show with contemptuous loathing, but it's also apparent Dey and Cassidy had ""God, what am still I doing here?"" expressions on their faces by that time too.

If you can only afford one dvd set of The Patridge Family, get this one, when they are all at their peak and the writing is the funniest.  Maybe the music will never rise above teenybopper bubblegum (it was actually a little better in the first season) but all of you Boomers of a certain age will nevertheless have many happy memories.",1469750400,2,5558,5.0

2403078,3,B000B6CODY,"When I was a kid I was a big fan of the Partridge Family and used to avidly buy their records, magazines about David Cassidy, and other stuff. So last year when I began ordering DVD sets of their TV series, I was excited to see them again after more than 30 years. So far I've seen again the first two seasons and am on the third one. While I enjoyed season one thoroughly, I found season two also good but I think the producers made a mistake when they decided for season two to turn the show into more of a typical family sitcom. By my count of season one, 19 of the 25 episodes were about the Partridge Family as a musical group to one degree or another, and in many of those 19 episodes they were on the road giving concerts. But in season two just 7 of the 24 episodes pertained to the family as musicians. As I said, I'm now watching season three, and so far the trend is continuing there.

  It's true that in season two every episode still shows them performing a song somewhere, and the fact that they're musicians or planning to give a concert soon is sometimes mentioned, but usually the song performance has little or nothing to do with the story. Further, most of the time they're at home and not shown on the road, so why were they seldom doing concert tours by season two? For instance, one episode has Laurie dating a member of a motorcycle gang, one has Keith going overboard trying to be a good influence on his siblings, one has Keith making a movie, one has Tracy and Chris running away to Reuben's apartment, one has Keith running away to an apartment next door, one finds Danny with a crush on a girl, and so on. By the way, most of the songs in season two are good ones, especially the songs taken from what is probably their best album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sound-Magazine/dp/B000TV4QWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sound Magazine</a>.

  Most of the episodes in season two are quite good, and actually some non-musical episodes are among the best in the series, such as the one with Arte Johnson as a Russian artist who paints a nude woman on the family's garage. The Christmas episode is another standout with its clever Western fantasy. However, what made ""The Partridge Family"" a unique show was the fact that they were a musical family, and as many reviewers here have mentioned, the show was loosely based on the real-life musical family The Cowsills. When the producers veered from that musical background in season two, the show became a pretty typical family sitcom that was enjoyable but not on the level of the best sitcoms such as ""All in the Family,"" ""M*A*S*H,"" ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show,"" ""Roseanne,"" and some others. The best sitcoms usually focus on some aspect of their background, and I believe if ""The Partridge Family"" had continued to focus on their musical background as they did in season one, the show might have become one of the best sitcoms of all time. Still, ""The Partridge Family"" is worthwhile viewing.

As for the DVDs themselves, the picture and sound quality of ""The Partridge Family"" Second Season are very good, with an image ratio of 1.33:1 and in color. These have a much higher quality image than my DVDs of ""All in the Family,"" which is also from the 1970s. The box and cases are good quality, with nice graphics and a short description of each episode. The Bonus Feature that allows you to play just the songs from all episodes on each disc is nice, and there are also some previews of other DVDs, but it's too bad there are not any featurettes or commentaries here as there were for season one.

So, I'm glad to be watching through ""The Partridge Family"" again after all these years, although I do wish they had kept focusing on the fact that they were a musical family.",1416096000,,3815,4.633136094674557

Arguably the best of the four season run of this awesome show, Season 2 finds Keith and Laurie and Danny and Shirley and Reuben and the two little kids (one of them the unconvincing tambourine player) comfortably finding their characters and interacting with each other in warm, funny and even moving ways.  And as always, no episode would be complete without the family on stage, in front of an audience that was always seated at dinner tables for some reason, and singing one of their terrific pop songs. -- One of the things that's nice is finding David Cassidy, who by this time had reached pop icon status, playing his part as Keith in a charming, self-deprecating way -- more sad sack than sex symbol.  He does this very well. And we all know that Danny Bonaduce was the comic of the show (his by-play with both Cassidy and Dave Madden is truly hilarious), but both Susan Dey and Shirley Jones have found their comic bones in season 2 and offer very funny performances.  The Partridges seem like more of a unit now, and their interplay is both convincing and very funny.  This is really one of the best shows of the 1970s and it holds up very well today.

2403098,4,B000B6CODY,"Despite a minor and never-explained cast change (blond Brian Forster taking over for brunet Jeremy Gelbwaks as drummer Chris), the Partridges retain their momentum in a second season whose episodes stem less from their show-biz career (though that's always an element) than from the natural crises of a family of five decent kids dealing with the difficulties of growing up and a sympathetic mother (Shirley Jones) trying to help them through the process.  Keith (David Cassidy) longs for his own apartment; Chris and Tracy (Suzanne Crough) decide to run away from home); Danny (Danny Bonaduce) goes to extraordinary lengths in his quest to finance a fur coat for his mother's birthday; and Laurie (Susan Dey) faces disaster when the school-newspaper editor unknowingly acquires her diary.  But they also address larger subjects on occasion, including the loneliness of the Jewish widow who wins ""a week with the Partridges,"" the burgeoning ecology movement of the 1970s, and the plight of American Indians on the reservation.  The family is wholesome and attractive, as too many modern-day sitcom ensembles aren't; the humor, if sometimes a bit broad or even embarrassing, is always clean; and the chemistry, not only among the family members but with their harried manager Reuben Kincaid (Dave Madden), is genuine and fun to watch.  Harry Morgan makes a second guest appearance, this time as a desert service-station owner who tries to get the Partridges to play for a festival benefiting his neighbors the Indians, and Ray Bolger and Rosemary DeCamp return as Shirley's free-spirited father and uptight neocon mother.  The songs are clean and tuneful (all the old Partridge albums are now out on CD), though of course largely performed by anonymous studio artists.  All in all, it's a good family show with a hearty dose of nostalgia for a transformative period.",1323388800,3,1865,5.179401993355482

2403100,5,B000B6CODY,"I grew up as a kid watching THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY.  I never missed the show and also bought all the albums.  It was such fun.  Now to watch it on dvd is a truly entertaining experience.  They put a lot of work into this dvd release.  The video is remeastered in high definition and has never looked better.  To watch the show unedited and without commercials shows how great this show really was.  The show is in no way dated.  It is quality family entertainment with Shirley Jones, David Cassidy, Susan Dey and Danny Bonaduce shining in particular.  I find watching the show as an adult that though very funny the show really was often tender and heartfelt.  This was truly a family that cared about each other and the unconditional love and support amongst them all provided a very strong message.

Season 2 was when the show really hit its stride and whether it be Shirley going back to college or Danny getting his tonsils removed each episode shines.  And don't forget the music.  Bubblegum pop at its best.  This set also allows you to watch just the song performances as well which is a nice bonus.  If you have fond memories of THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY buying the dvds is a no brainer.  And believe me, it has never sounded or looked better.  Highly recommended.",1317772800,,1265,4.5265486725663715
2403101,5,B000B6CODY,"After watching season 1 until he could quote the episodes verbatim, I leaped at the chance to buy season 2 for my son if only for a change of scenery on the TV screen and found myself once again sucked into the 70s courtesy of Shirley and family.  This season is decidedly sillier, with less of a 'moral' at the end of each episode, and the focus is more on the family at home, which is the way it should be.  Guest stars abound (my fave is Rob Reiner as the love-struck biker), the music is toe-tapping and fun, and the Partridges look beautiful!  Cast off your fashion inhibitions by slipping into a velvet pantsuit and enjoy over 10 hours of pure family fun.  Just don't be surprised if you are singing the groovy tunes in public when the collection is over.",1313193600,,761,4.338028169014085

2403104,5,B000B6CODY,"Season Two is where the Partridge's established themselves as cult favorites for all who were lucky enough to see this series when it first aired.  Danny and Keith's bickering provides just enough edge to keep the cute factor in check, and the music, while fairly treacly, is at least not offensive.  There's a new Chris (the first actor bit people!), a new theme song, and oodles of colorful period fashions on display.  And there's that goofily psychedelic bus and acerbic Reuben Kincaid (a terrific Dave Madden)and various 70's causes like environmentalism, Red Power, and women's lib-- take that, Brady Bunch!  The Partridges can kick your white bread asses!

Highlights include learning the answers to trivia questions (what was Keith Partridge's middle name?  Shirley Partridge's maiden name?),  manager Reuben Kincaid's film debut in fairy wings and a tutu, a still-relevant appeal to protect the whales (including ""The Whale Song"", an otherwise unavailable track with Shirley on lead vocal) in ""Whatever Happened to Moby Dick?"", and something that still makes an impact on me, the incredible Shirley Jones in hot pants (in ""The Undergraduate"").  She was TV's sexiest mom back then, and probably for all time.

The DVDs lack special features, but they have been remastered brilliantly and look amazing.  These take me back to happy kidhood -- wish I had held onto my trading cards, they're probably worth a bundle now.",1287014400,,1425,5.156521739130435

2403106,5,B000B6CODY,"I purchased this DVD figuring my daughters would enjoy it as much as my wife and I did when it originally aired. This program is fun, easy viewing and listening. We tend to think of the early 70's as the ""good old days"" but we forget that like today we had military conflicts, nuclear threats, and perpetual government political fighting. Nothing has changed but our age and angle of perspective. So, if the world is basically the same, why do today's television comedies depend on base sexual inuendo and insults to get laughs? It's sad. We were not a nave society in the 70's. Life was just as challenging then as today. We simply had the class to create polite and clean comedy. What a concept! The Partridge Family is fun to watch and has life lessons thrown in that we can all appreciate. Hang Ten and enjoy!",1263254400,2,813,4.5
2403107,5,B000B6CODY,"Throughly enoyed seeing all the Partdiges again - a really fine quality show, unlike the garbage that's on TV today.

Also, no commentaries on season 2 by Shirley Jones, David Cassidy, and Danny Bonaduce.  This is a big asset on Season 1, as Danny is informative along with being hilarious.  Hope Season 3 can bring them together for some more interviews, as this is an asset.  The songs on Season 2 aren't as good as on Season 1.

2403124,5,B000B6CODY,"Another great blast from the past TV series. Nicely done dvd's but it would have been nice to have a ""play all musical numbers"" choice on the disk in addition to being able to play just the musical numbers separately. Picture quality is excellent as well as the sound. Funny the way they use that same dinner theatre audience canned footage in most of the live shots. What really shines is the awesome talent of David Cassidy. After the first season though, the songwriting had gone to crap and there were fewer memorable songs as the series went on. No fault of the cast, the producers should have looked up Boyce and Hart or Carole King for some tunes.

All in all, a great trip back in time!",1169078400,,694,4.421875

It seems this is getting to be a trend releasing one or two seasons then stopping. It's happened so far with The Partridge Family, Leave It To Beaver, Here Come The Brides, F-Troup, Rawhide and Have Gun Will Travel. I don't understand what the hold up is on getting these great old shows released. Heaven knows there is nothing on today's TV but trash and if it were not for my vintage DVD's I would not bother to turn the TV on. I for one look forward to reliving wonderful times when watching these great shows. I guess at this point it's too much to ask for The Donna Reed Show, The Patty Duke Show and Father Knows Best to be released.",1168646400,9,736,4.118055555555555

2403127,5,B000B6CODY,"Why do we feel so good inside when we hear a song that can move us? Songs that are so happy and carefree that they can even move us to tears. Songs that can do that to us and for us have a special magic and power all their own. We all have a place, an era of music that we can say has been the genesis of why we genuinely, love and cherish certain types of musical sounds, lyrics, instruments, and voices.

 I too have found beautiful music that transcends me to heights of time and true bliss. I found that in the music of The Partridge Family. Others whom I would tell, or mention this to, from today's generation may look at me a little odd. I accept it, and move on from it. I know what I like and where the passion is and I can find it in their music. It is their lyrics, their special sound, their voices, and the harmony that in combination makes beautiful music. Their harmony by a number of augmented performers is by far and foremost the #1 factor that has put the imprint on my soul, to stay. It was and is the genesis to me that makes me appreciate harmony from other singers and groups from yesteryear and of today. Though the popular music from the 60's and 70's lives in my heart, something about the harmony from The Partridge Family stole my heart. I was never to see it again, happily so. In the past it has lifted me up from a melancholy day or sour mood. It makes me feel that any problem I have can be managed, that my problems are not so complex and out of reach, and that I can handle them productively.

 We all have passions, things that we love, adore and cherish. Things that make us so happy we want to share it, whether or not others want to hear us discuss it. Perhaps because what we are passionate about, may not be what other's find passionate. But just like I have my passion, others have theirs. What they feel in their soul, their hearts about what they like is the same exact feeling only in reverse. They may be different songs, music groups, celebrities, books, different pieces

of art, but passion and love for something is exactly the same. You just have to understand your passions to understand the other persons and then no one can call you crazy. They still might but we don't care because each of us has that something special that will make us feel good when we feel bad, turn around our cloudy crazy days and spin it around to something so much sweeter.

I could listen to many different singers, groups and even though I would enjoy their work, voice, emotion, lyrics, I still come back to what I grew up with, what nurtured me and what transformed me emotionally. The Partridge family music is the love of my musical world. They might not have been a real group to travel and do live shows, but they were real. Everything from the lyrics, the music, and by far the heaven sent harmony was real. Tom and John Bahler, along with Jackie Ward and Ron Hicklin were the foreground and background vocals that added to David Cassidy's foreground vocals that tell me I have been blessed to know these songs and voices.

It is these little gems that we search for in life that all of us need to have and to hold on to dearly. I am thankful for them. Since childhood, and thru my life's journey, I will hear their sweet sounds and a bright smile would appear on my face and stay there. I hear those simple wonderful lyrics about love, the beat of their music and those heartfelt sounds of harmony that seem to float in the air and take flight, and does not descend until the end. It simply feels like a magic of overwhelming proportions.

 In my childhood knowing that I loved their music a neighbor in my building gifted me their first two albums. As the years passed I would collect each new album, each one having so many songs that really grabbed me like a vice and never let go. Few groups I could say that I like all their songs or even most. The Partridge Family is one of few that I can say I do love most.

When major fans of The Partridge Family enjoy their most famous songs, as I do, I have my personal favorites that did not necessarily make the cut of ""Greatest hits"" collections or even their numerous albums. These would include in part ""The love Song""  ""Let the good times in"" ""Only a moment ago"" ""Together"" ""She'd rather have the rain."" ""Together we're better""

 ""I really want to know you"" ""Somebody wants to love you"" ""You don't have to tell me""  ""On the road"" and ""Too be lovers,"" just to name a few of my all time favorites. They get me out of the doldrums. They put love in my heart; a smile permanently imprinted on my soul and gives me inspiration in my gait. Aside from their musical numbers, they had the best background music. Anytime Shirley had a heart to heart with the kids the background music was there. It was both emotionally tender and sentimental. No matter how syrupy some may say it was, I bought it hook, line and sinker and after that came running back for more background music.

 No matter what music each person loves or wherever they may find their passion, those feelings you get from what you love is the same that I get with what I love. The subject may be different but the intense feelings of passion are the same. So you love what you love and I love what I love. Be thankful and consider yourself blessed. I know I do.

  I hope they bring out seasons three and four soon and don't keep us waiting.",1156032000,6,5391,4.288385826771654

It was rougly 6 months between the release of Season 1 and Season 2.  It has been about 8 months (from when I wrote this) since Season 2.

2403130,5,B000B6CODY,"This second season of the Partridge Family starts off with something new. (Chris was replaced by Brian Forester shortly after the first Chris moved back east with his family.)

The second season of the Partridge Family starts off on a sour note thanks to the character of Dona Kelly a woman whom Reuben got to sing with the Partridge Family who can not actually sing at all.

Through the season more things happen to the Partridge Family. Danny gets his tonsils out in an early episode and thinks that he can't really sing with the family for several weeks.

Other things that happen during season two is that Danny gets his first crush on a neighbor girl named Gloria Hickey, but she likes Keith instead. Also the Partridge Family hires an ex-con and Rueben gets put in jail because he went to see if the ex-con had done a bank robbery.

Also a very hilarious episode is on season two. The Partridges are going home after a Christmas concert, but the bus breaks down and they spend some time with an old man while Reuben and Keith fix the bus. The old man tells them a story about Christmas a while before and when he tells the story the Partridge appear as the people in the story.

Most of these episodes that have been in rerun syndication all these years had very minor scenes that were edited out and left on the cutting room floor because of politically incorrect jokes and other lame dialogue. Those of you familiar only with the USA Networks reruns in the late 1980's or VH1's reruns in the mid-90's will be happy to have the these versions!

Altho you would do well purchasing this set it really is only for the die hard fan or completist.",1139184000,,506,4.22680412371134
2403140,4,B000B6CODY,She was easliy and by far the most physically attractive person in the cast of PF. And interesting too. I love the way the writers allowed her to still carry most season 2 eps despite Keith's more defined and expanded role now than he had in season one. Speaking of season two it is less raw looking than the first season. With more suburban home emphasis than the first season by far. The plots and story are not terribly consistant with the first season but hey it is a sitcom. Better than anything we can make now on tv.,1134432000,4,523,4.292929292929293
2403141,5,B000B6CODY,"The second year of the Partridge Family found the gears of the Partridge money making machine spinning full tilt. David Cassidy's likeness graced the walls of countless teenybopper bedrooms and the music industry was taken by storm by an imaginary family band based on the Cowsills. But by year two, the Partridges had burst beyond the Cowsill mold and had implanted themselves firmly in the book of rock and roll history, their records outselling big performers of the time even breaking the Beatles reign of ""Let It Be"". Their LP ""Sound Magazine sold a staggering amount and hit gold status in no time and the show had been nominated for several awards. Season Two outshines possibly the rest of the four seasons and although many critics had passed off the show as silly, non-sensical fluff, the Partridges had already won the hearts of the American audience (as well as international fan clubs abroad!) The second season sees a lot of Danny's hairbrained schemes to propel the family to stardom and make money including making a whale part of the band and over breeding hamsters, Shirley going back to college, Laurie dating a biker (played to the hilt by All In The Family's own Meathead!), and the classic fan hit ""Santa, Don't Bring Your Guns To Town"" a funny yet touching Christmas tale starring veteran Dean Jagger.

When they are not tooling around the country in their tour bus, the Partridges still find the time to help those in need (the Papagos Indians and a down and out bakery owner), and master the causes of endangered species (""Whatever Happened To Moby Dick"". The shows are funny, light and full of weekly ""Moral of the Week"" sensibilty that makes it highly fit for family consumption. As far as the DVD set, all 24 episodes are neatly packaged in two slim cases on 3 disks, the transfer is still remarkably clean and colorful after all of these years except for the girl scout scene in ""H-E-L-L-L-L-L-P"" which appears a bit fuzzy. This can be overlooked whereas the rest appears crisp and the sound fairly clear considering most of the music was produced in mono. Those of you with stereo sound will note the songs still stand out and sound fairly clear. Sadly, for those who enjoy the extras, there are none here aside from the ""Jump To Musical Performances"" yet there must be a fountain of extras out there available, whether it be bloopers or extra commentaries. I was so pleased to own these great shows, I can overlook the extras not being there. When all is said and done, the Partridge Family's Second Season is worth having just for the episodes and songs, no extras are necessary! A steal at these bargain prices. Do yourself a favor and buy both season one and two and c'mon.......get happy!!!",1133913600,19,2725,4.7368421052631575
2403142,4,B000B6CODY,"The Partridge Family settle into a smooth groove in season 2, with episodes that less frequently emphasize the novelty of an ordinary family trying to maintain its normaility while being transformed into pop icons.

The episodes are no less fun to watch than season 1. However, some of the episodes in season 2 lack the realism of season 1, complete with dream sequences, some truly ludicrous plots, and slapstick that borders on Three Stooges insanity at times. None of this is necessarily a bad thing, mind you, but it does give an entirely different character to the show in season 2.

For example, ""In 25 Words Or Less"" has a pop star family inviting a complete stranger who won a contest to live in their home for a week, before they've even met this person once. Aside from the arrogance of such a prize, which contrasts with their humility in season 1, it seems unlikely that in real life the winner of such a contest would receive much more than backstage passes to a concert--surrounded by bodyguards.

Another episode (""Forty Year Itch"") reprises Shirley's parents in a plot that almost seems like a minor rewrite of a very similar episode in season 1, leaving me feeling somewhat cheated.

The biggest offense, however, is found in ""Where Do Mermaids Go?"" Here, we have the wholly improbable plot of a hippie girl giving the family a million dollars, no strings attached, simply because they were nice to her for a day. Even worse, the family ends up giving the money back because of some rather minor inconveniences from gold-diggers and such, which could easily have been avoided if the writers weren't trying so hard to make a morality play out of the whole thing. In real life, the family would almost certainly have kept the money (since the girl didn't need it), moved to a more private home, and used that money for the purpose that they formed the band in the first place: to pay for the kids' college educations. This episode could eaily have been written by Frank Capra, since we are supposed to be as proud of the family for giving away their financial security as Capra taught a generation of Americans to be proud of giving up their extraordinary lifelong dreams in exchange for suburban mediocrity. The episode shares another thing in common with ""It's a Wonderful Life""--both feature an evil banker!

At least two episodes stand out as particularly funny, however. ""I Am A Curious Partridge"" has Danny writing some vicious rumors about Keith and Shirley in a pop culture magazine, with predictably hilarious results (and getting a taste of his own medicine in return!). And best of all, ""H-E-L-L-L-L-L-P"", in which the men follow the camping women into the wilderness to protect them and end up needing to be rescued themselves, features what may be the best line in the entire series, when a beaten-down Reuben Kinkaid falls to his knees like Charlton Heston in ""Planet of the Apes"" and crys out, ""If nature is so perfect, why doesn't it make a can opener? Why, why, why?"" (Believe me, in context it will have you rolling with laughter!).

Despite the uninspired writing and silly gimmicks that plague season 2, this is after all the Patridge Family--one of the best shows ever on television--and the episodes still have a lot of heart. So I still highly recommend it.

The DVD itself, however, loses a star for completely lacking special features of any meaningful kind, as other reviewers have lamented. This three disk set contains 24 episodes, and absolutely nothing else that is noteworthy. For the price I guess even that is acceptable. Still, let's hope we get more commentary, insider information, candid footage and other goodies in season 3.",1133568000,5,3678,4.810126582278481
