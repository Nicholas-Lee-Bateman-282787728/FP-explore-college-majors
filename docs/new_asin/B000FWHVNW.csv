2593015,5,B000FWHVNW,"This anime is one of my favorites and cracks me up all the time.  It is the mini-pack edition, so it doesn't come with much extra stuff, but I don't mind it. While I understand it is certainly not for everyone, this one has great humor.",1231459200,,236,4.130434782608695
2593016,2,B000FWHVNW,"I bought this set based on the other glowing reviews so perhaps I had an overly high expectation.  As I didn't find this that funny, I wanted to write this dissenting review.  Overall, I found this anime to be boring and I almost fell asleep several times.

The type of humor consists of:
1.  a long setup followed up by a sudden incongruity.  For example, the straight character will describe how he expects to see a great tough guy, who is super tough, and everyone is scared and he is scared, and how this guy must be incredible, etc... he slides open the door, and it is... a Gorilla.  wha????  (Gorilla can be replaced by Freddie, from Queen, look-alike, or a robot, or an alien, a horse, et. al.)
2.  repetition of something really inane.  For example, as described in another review, a song that is being hummed... and everyone, I mean Everyone is caught up in trying to identify the song.
3.  inability to get something done - for example, to say one's name, to practice baseball, to not throw up, to go to the bathroom, etc.
4.  over-analysis of humor and the inability to appreciate humor... (um, does this review count?)

Well, that's the basic type of humor - absurd but, in my opinion, too shallow.  Most of the action is a talking head type of shot (like 80%) - hence my qualification that this is barely an anime (as self-referenced in the beginning of the show).  To be fair, I did laugh a few times, but it was rare.  And you may very well enjoy this anime, but it is not for everyone.

Also, note that the episodes are about 12-15 minutes long.  The actual show is like 8-10 minutes long with the rest being credits and a short preview of the next episode.",1196812800,7,1674,4.400651465798045
2593017,5,B000FWHVNW,"This show is effin' sweet. I love this when I first saw it on Anime Network. If you like ridiculously dumb random comedy, then you will definitely love this show!",1192060800,,162,4.433333333333334
2593018,5,B000FWHVNW,I really enjoy watching this DVD!  I think it is AWESOME and funny!  I am so glad to purchase this DVD from Amazon!,1172102400,,115,3.9565217391304346
2593019,5,B000FWHVNW,"While I have seen my share of anime, I am not overly big on it-- often, the humor falls flat and there's only so many times I can handle sweatdrops for no apparent reason or the random nosebleeds that seem to ail the population. (Yes, yes, cultural differences and all that. I know.) Despite that, there have been a few shining examples of seriously GOOD anime and this is one of them. It's ridiculous, which is where is gets its humor... like the episode that is ALL about a tune no one can name but everyone can hum. I've only seen an episode or two of Seinfeld, but I understand it as a reference to pointless humor and so, if I must compare, this would rate up there next to Seinfeld in that manner. I think this was better than Seinfeld, though.

On a technical note, the dubbing is exceptional on these and if you've watched any amount of anime (or foreign films) you'll know that the right dubbing can make or break the experience. Often times, we're given no recourse but to watch it subbed because the dubbing is so bad. No so with these; they did a great job with the voice acting, so fear not!

Go into these expecting ridiculous, pointless humor and you'll be very, very pleased. This is the best anime I have seen in a long time and next to Ranma 1/2 and a few other classics, one of the few sets I would consider owning. Good stuff! Enjoy!!",1165276800,10,1354,4.305882352941176
2593020,5,B000FWHVNW,"Funny, twisted, warped and that's just the first episode.  With it's parodies of Japanese culture, twisted characters and all around screwiness, this is an original.  If you are looking for something funny and different, then this is the anime for you.",1162598400,,252,5.121951219512195
2593021,5,B000FWHVNW,"I love box sets that cost almost as much as about two individual DVDs. This is a steal for an amazing series.

Now, this show is pure comedy. You will not find intricate plots or heart-felt relationships, but you WILL laugh. For example, should the main character tell his classmates that one of them is actually a robot? But wait, maybe they're right. Maybe he ISN'T a robot and just looks funny. Then everyone would think he's a jerk for calling the weird looking kid a robot. Awesome, cerebral comedy with commentary on how PC we can be sometimes. Plus, as a n added value, this anime has a much higher re-watchability factor than a show like, say, Escaflowne. With no true plot you can watch them again and again the way you might Seinfeld or Friends.",1161475200,9,755,4.510948905109489

8127561,5,B000FWHVNW,Honestly this show is like me and my friends when we like to act as satirical as possible. This show really hits home and we even have our own characters that are almost exactly like us when we like to screw around.,1356652800,,215,4.142857142857143
8127562,5,B000FWHVNW,"1st i thought this show was stupid from the 1st few episodes, but after a while i just couldn't start laughing my butt off. this is a crazy stupid funny as hell show. my only prob is that each episode is about 10 min long. but despite that any1 who is in to laughing should pic this wierd show up asap",1348876800,,301,3.9508196721311477
8127563,5,B000FWHVNW,"I first saw this anime on youtube & thought it was a joke; that somebody took an anime & did their own parody dub, but no! That was the actual show! I bust up laughing every time I watch it! An instant new fave!",1346198400,,211,3.8181818181818183
8127564,4,B000FWHVNW,"This show is hilarious, I only wish there were more episodes to watch! I will admit that the final episodes do begin to get pretty dry when compared to the rest of the series. But overall, this is totally worth watching for anybody that's a fan of FUNNY. I wouldn't consider myself an anime fan, but I do enjoy laughing. IF YOU THINK YOU ENJOY LAUGHING TOO, THEN DO WHAT I DID: BUY THIS DVD COLLECTION AND MAYBE WATCH IT SOME TIME.",1343260800,,431,4.2682926829268295
8127565,5,B000FWHVNW,"If you want a surreal look at the world of Japanese high schools, this is the one for you. Takashi Kamiyama, a normal high school student, is enrolled in Cromartie High, notorious for being filled with the baddest of badasses in Tokyo, some of which include a robot, a gorilla, and a man with a striking resemblance to Queen's lead singer. This collection is one of my absolute favorites, and I get more laughs every time I watch.",1339632000,,430,4.5256410256410255
8127566,5,B000FWHVNW,Terrific anime! Also got what expected so cant complain. Great quality for an older anime also. need four words more,1329696000,,116,4.85
8127567,5,B000FWHVNW,"Crowmartie is hilarious. I wish there were more anime as offbeat, quirky, abstract brand of comedy as this. I loved Excell Saga when it came out but in the years since, there has been few and far between with Crowmartie's flavor. This definately satisfied that need.",1255478400,,266,4.804347826086956
8127568,5,B000FWHVNW,"While the shipping did take some time, it did come within the expected time. The DVD itself is hilarious.",1251936000,,105,4.578947368421052
