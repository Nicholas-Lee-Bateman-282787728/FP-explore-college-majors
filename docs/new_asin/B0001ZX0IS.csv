8019239,5,B0001ZX0IS,I thought it was funny and yet action pack. People who don't know cassavona Wong get to know him. This guy kick butts and legs and abousately everything in sight,1422576000,,161,4.4
8019240,5,B0001ZX0IS,"Awesome film, featuring underrated kung fu film star Casanova Wong. Looks like the unlikely hero--until he starts kicking, then you know he's the man.",1413504000,,150,5.291666666666667
8019241,4,B0001ZX0IS,"...But wow, the fight choreography! The action is VERY good in this film, and I laughed at Casanova Wong's ""kung-fu master gone nuts"" character a few times in spite of myself. THE MASTER STRIKES is full of familiar faces: besides Wong, there's Yen Shi-kwan, the villain from FEARLESS HYENA; Meng Yuen-man from DAGGERS 8; and even Eddy Kao Hung(who popped up in numerous early-to-mid-seventies chop-socky flicks). It's also fun to count how many times the same extra plays a different character in this film ;)
If you like kung-fu movies in the old style, you won't be disappointed in THE MASTER STRIKES.",1103846400,4,603,4.921568627450981
8019242,3,B0001ZX0IS,"this movie has a couple of saving graces: the subtitles translations are quite ridiculious, and also the ""pole fighting"". i swear to god this has the best pole fighting action ive ever seen (and i have seen a lot). yet the characters are annoying and after a while one may become frustrated at watching them. (Action good =30 mins) rest of the movie is just pure filler. the movie as i remember it was long as hell so that 30 minutes may not even be worth the whole experience.",1095984000,3,477,4.370786516853933
8019243,1,B0001ZX0IS,"Having seen 2 other movies from the Dolemite Collection and enjoyed them very much, i was really disappointed by this one. Mediocre Kung Fu, boring story and characters, and way too much screaming from the characters. Way too much screaming! Now in every Kung Fu movie there are the occasional ""ha-ya"" or ""waaa"" or any other assorment of vocals sounds, but in this movie it was as if the directors instructions were to ""make the biggest most annoying shrilly high-pitched idiotic scream and act like total moron if possible"" in each scene. Maybe that was just a problem with bad dubbing, but not even the best dubbing could save this shipwreck of a movie. The crazy guy was just annoying and not much of a comedic character.. and what else can i say... i got this movie [at a local store] on sale for 1 cent, and I can understand why it was on sale for so cheap...
Go and get Hitman of the Buddha or Kung Fu vs. Yoga, from the same collection, but don't waste time on this one...",1018915200,,979,4.414364640883978
