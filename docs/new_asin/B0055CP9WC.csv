The settings were good and the acting was pretty fair.  All in all, not a bad 3 pack to add to a collection.",1391472000,2,277,3.963636363636364
4573750,3,B0055CP9WC,"Let me just open this review with a bit of a disclaimer. I like bad movies. I know they're bad and I like them anyway. I like good movies too, but I have a soft spot for b movies that would bias my opinion of them. So if you like b flicks too, your opinion of these might be more in synch with mine. That being said:

GRIZZLY RAGE: Four recent high school grads (average age 28) get liquored up and break into a ""private preserve"" for some good natured fun. They accidentally run over a bear cub. Happens every day right? Well in this story the bear cubs Mom is on hand to seek out revenge, as we know from scientific research bears always do. This mom though has been nipping at the toxic waste which bad guys dumped in a lake, which has the effect of mutating her into stock footage. It's also made her stronger, faster and meaner than your average bear.

  To make a long LONG story short, all the obnoxious ""teens"" eventually pass through the Momma bear's digestive system where, in death, they are far more useful than they ever have been in life as fertilizer for future prairie flowers and grasses. The fact that none of them were allowed to escape and reproduce is the best part of this movie.

HYBRID: Remember that movie The Animal that starred Deuce Bigelow Male Gigolo and that mildly cute girl from the first Survivor? He was a security guard or something and he was horribly injured so a mad scientist transplanted animal organs into his body and he got their powers? Well this is just like that except unlike The Animal it's not even accidentally funny, but the acting is better and it's somehow more believable.

  Basically Justine Bateman helps a dude out by replacing his damaged eyes with wolf eyeballs. This obviously leads to him developing wolf powers, like night vision, which is cool at first, until the more undesirable wolf traits start to manifest themselves, like growling, snarling, a thirst for human blood and butt-scooting across the living room carpet. This one's not bad and manages to add a twist to the werewolf mythology.

HELLHOUNDS: Ok so a bride is poisoned on her wedding night and dies a virgin. Her spirit is taken to Tartarus so she can marry Hades, who likes the virgins. He's also king of the Ancient Greek Underworld. The hubby, who's gotta be blue-ballin' it by now, gathers together a rag-tag band of ancient Greek adventurers and hopping the nearest portal to Hell, attempts to rescue his bride. Along the way, as you might guess they encounter various obstacles, including the titular Hell hounds.

Supposedly it took 15 days to film this movie. If that's true then everyone involved must have spent the first 14 days calling their agents and begging to get out of their contracts. As expected the effects aren't that great but that's usually not a big problem for me in these cheap b movies. The movie has no sense of fun, no spirit of adventure, things which we get in abundance from the old Sinbad and Hercules movies of the 60s and 70s which this movie seems to want to imitate.",1391385600,5,3034,4.560661764705882
4573751,2,B0055CP9WC,"Maneater Triple Feature 6: Grizzly Rage / Hybrid / Hellhounds  -Spoilers Below

Grizzly Rage:  Four young adults drive fast in a protected forest they broke a gate to enter and they run down a grizzly cub.  Mom Grizzly pursues and kills one young man.  Other three jump in their old four wheel drive and tear out, but wait one idiot wants to go back to the guy that is dead (does he think he's alive or is this some idiotic writers way to let momma Grizzly catch them?) and he grabs the steering wheel and drives them over a cliff. Momma catches up and chews up another trying to go for help because their vehicle is overheated, they have only thirty empty plastic water bottles, and there is no cell phone reception.  I don't know why they just didn't lay in the road and let the Grizzly roll over them.  Last scene two survivors, young girl and man are cornerd by mom, fake looking blood splatters on the TV screen, end of story.  No survivors and no reason to like it.  If they had stamped idiot on their heads and added some Darwinian comedy it may have stood a chance. I won't watch it ever again, it's a waste of everyone's time.

Hybrid:  Young man goes into fire and saves a smoking idiot that kept lighting cigarettes in a room with flammable drums.  Meanwhile Native American girl and her grandfather save an injured wolf and take it to a research lab.  Man that was blinded is brought to that research center and receives scientific breakthrough surgery giving him the injured wolfs eyes.  Man sees wolf memories and wants to hunt Buffalo.  Man escapes research center and is chased by military equipped security.  Man joins dog pack and invades Zoo.  Man is captured. Man escapes to Indian land and joins wolfpack.  Man and a few wolves chew up security.  The end.  Once again this is not a movie I would re-watch.

Hellhounds:  Best in the bunch.  An ancient story of a young warrior engaged to beautiful princess.  One of warriors friends is actually in league with Hades and helps him kidnap the princess.  The young warrior goes after the princess and his warrior friends and his scholarly brother join him and they enter Hades.  Hellhounds eat some including the bad guy working with Hades and then the hounds are finally killed.  Warrior and Princess marry and live happily ever after.  This I might re-watched if it's on TV.

This set wasn't nearly as entertaining as any other Maneater Series sets or movies.  Another shortcoming was the fact they stacked all three DVDs on top one another instead of having plastic inserts to separate Discs and store individually like others in the Maneater Series.  I am donating this set to some worthy organization and I hope they enjoy it more than I did.

4573752,5,B0055CP9WC,Service was great. Shipping was fast.  All three movies were great. I especially  liked grizzly rage. Hellhounds seemed a little more low budget but I still enjoyed it,1364860800,,167,4.928571428571429
4573753,3,B0055CP9WC,"I knew what I was getting into when I bought it...you don't go buying a three pack of any sci-fi (sorry SyFy) movies without knowing you're getting a set of b-movies...
Hybrid was the most interesting of the three, with it's blending of typical werewolf story and mystical experiences, I liked that one a lot.
Hellhounds was the one I was more interested in initially, it's more fantasy than horror/sci-fi. The Hellhounds of the title are barely in it, and quite frankly not as important as the sword & sorcery theme of a descent into the underworld to rescue a lost love while dealing with treachery and jealousy. Nothing spectacular, but not a bad bit of fantasy fiction.
Grizzly Rage was, to be frank, just stupid and bad. It is the worst stereotype of the carefree kids do something stupid, get in trouble, and do more stupid things repeatedly while being stalked by a grizzly bear who does very few things the way an actual bear would.",1350345600,,940,4.634730538922156
4573754,5,B0055CP9WC,"Grizzly rage is a marvellous movie, The performance of the actors is great and entertaining, The story line is different and worth 10 out of 10 for the entire movie, sit on your edge of suspense and wait for things to happen.

8457992,5,B0055CP9WC,"This set focuses on beasts, bears, dogs, etc. I have to admit ""Grizzly Rage"" was my least favorite of the three. Not to say it was bad, I just expected a little better. But, hey these are after all ""B"" movies and they are the best that they can be for what they are. These are the movies that play on SyFy on Saturdays and Sundays, but commercial free. I know, I hate those commercials too, they just seem to never end. I gave the set 5 stars because it entertains. But, I have to admit it is the weakest of all of the sets that Maneater has put out so far, and I own everyone of them. If only to complete the set, I suggest you buy it, if you are looking for a great set of ""B"" movies, then you would be better off buying a different set by Maneater.

8457993,2,B0055CP9WC,"Don't waste your time. While Hybrid was ""ok"" for a view the other two pretty much sucked. There are some pretty good movies in the Maneater series of films but Grizzly Rage was not one of them. Drawn out and not very reality based. Hell hounds,didn't like it almost immediately.
