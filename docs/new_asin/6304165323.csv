7863497,5,6304165323,Our grandchildren had watch video so much we wore out our original copy. Had to reorder new one. Was like new and they are really enjoying it.,1392336000,,142,4.296296296296297
7863498,5,6304165323,"My mother and I enjoy watching the Eyewitness videos which are jam-packed full of scientific information and beautiful imagery. Eyewitness Volcano is no exception. It covers some of the basic concepts of Volcanoes from eruption to aftermath. It includes an encapsulated account of the eruption of Vesuvius to the eruption of Mt. St. Helens.
In particular, I like the Eyewitness videos because they give plenty of information, without going into many of the gory details. I only wish they were longer! Suitable for the entire family, and nature-lovers everywhere.",1056326400,,562,5.325842696629214
7863499,5,6304165323,"My four-year old loves this video.  I was worried that the content would scare him, but it is well done.  It keeps his interest every time he watches it.  Eyewitness videos are a great resource for any subject your preschooler is interested in.  The dinosaur one has also been a big hit.",1035936000,11,287,4.461538461538462
7863500,5,6304165323,"I've got about fifteen eyewitness videos and this one is one of the very best.  (This one, coincidentally, is also my five year old's favorite.)  Some of the eyewitness videos are capable of putting you to sleep faster than cheap beer after a twenty hour day, but ""Volcano"" won't.  The other two eyewitness videos I highly recommend are ""Ocean"" and  ""Human Machine.""  The ""Rocks"" video is a snooze (I teach geology and love rocks but this one even puts me to sleep).  The ""Planets"" video is OK, though I thought there were at least two minor factual errors.  The ""DesertS video is kind of a snooze, as well.  ""Bears"" is a little bit better, but you get tired of seeing the cute and cuddly fur balls by the end of it--it doesn't hold up well to repeated viewings.  Surprisingly, ""Trees"" is pretty wonderful and keeps your attention to the end.  ""Monsters"" is another great one.  (The little guy loves that one too.)  Don't get ""Mammals"" video--they made it using a bunch of stock video, and the narraration sucks.  But it's definitely better than ""Rugrats.""  If you have kids, I strongly recommend getting lots of the videos in this series.  Buy them a new one a week.  It's ten times better for them, than letting them watch the cartoon channel--an activity which will completely rot their brains out.  It's better to sit kids in front of an ""Eyewitness"" series video, where they learn wonderful things about our beautiful world.",1007596800,30,1429,4.69758064516129
