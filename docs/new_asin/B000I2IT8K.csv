8143208,4,B000I2IT8K,"i  watch cheaters every week, i guess they got canceled so i ordered the best of, it is uncensored and better than what you see on tv.",1456876800,,134,3.962962962962963

8143210,5,B000I2IT8K,Cheaters is raw television. That is why this DVD is great.,1415059200,,58,4.363636363636363
8143211,3,B000I2IT8K,"Buyer beware! Half of these episodes are hosted by Tommy Grand, not the Great One Joey Greco. I was quite disappointed to pop this DVD into my player and see Tommy Grand introing the first episode.",1306022400,2,197,4.5
8143212,4,B000I2IT8K,"Well, it isn't completely uncensored. There is still some shielding / blurring of some of the action. And, I was kind of expecting these to be not before seen cases. I think I didn't read the description correctly. :)

All in all, it is entertaining.",1176336000,8,250,4.555555555555555
8143213,3,B000I2IT8K,I purchased this during a deployment to alleviate the boredom of an otherwise uneventful time.  I had already purchased Best of Cheaters Vol. 1 and Uncensored Vol. 5 and I was really happy with both. I was disappointed to still see some situation still blurred though all the cursing was spot on.  I would have to say that this one had more bark than bite.  I can only hope the Uncensored Vol. 7 has more action than this did.,1174953600,13,426,4.367088607594937
8143214,3,B000I2IT8K,"not all that different than tv show,just a lot of cusswords,i guess that is mostly the uncensored part,just not enough nudity for me really only 2 scenes of nudity,no caption which you need to follow all the back and forth talking between all parties involved including Joey and Tommy,but it did show alot of the scenes i had forgot about.",1173744000,7,339,4.666666666666667
