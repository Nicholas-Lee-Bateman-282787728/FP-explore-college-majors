4534103,5,B0053O8AZA,"The person that gave this a 1 star must not read much because these versions of Dragon Ball Z are true to the orginal material in the japanese comics aka manga. The Dragon Ball episodes are suppose to be missing the fillers, which are the episodes not included in the manga/comics. These versions of the Dragon Ball Z series known as Dragon Ball Z Kai are much better in my opinion than the other Dragon Ball Z sets due to new voice work and centain parts of the animation being redone. The other Dragon Ball Z set that are really good and includes all the fillers are Dragon Ball Z gold boxes, which is probably what that person should of brought if they wanted all the fillers.",1311724800,8,679,4.354330708661418
4534104,5,B0053O8AZA,"These seem to be high quality, the voice overs have been redone... and they also leave out parts of each episode! I was told that the Kai ones weren't uncut...and they aren't uncut. So far every episode I have seen has about 2-3 min of the episode missing when compared to the old ones. I find this to be normal as this is exactly what it was supposed to be.",1311465600,9,358,4.128571428571429

So far every episode I have seen has about 2-3 min of the episode missing when compared with my old ones.  I find this weird as they do have more of the blood graphics left in but have extra other stuff missing.,1311465600,2,385,4.175675675675675
4534205,5,B0053O8AZA,"The quality of this video is pretty good. This old anime has been remastered and the story turned back into the manga's tale without the filler and episodes of ""powering up."" It removed a ton of discussion that was pointless was also removed. This is 350 minutes of the true story. This provides great audio and cleaned up video that improves enjoyment. Good purchase for DBZ fans looking for the straight forward story.",1354320000,2,420,4.767123287671233
4534206,5,B0053O8AZA,"I really enjoyed watching this saga as well. One of my favorite fights in the entire show was Piccolo vs. Android 18. I do have to say it's strange to see the subtitles be completely different than what's spoken. Like I mentioned in my Part 5 review, I never got the chance to see previous episodes of Kai (Watched all the original Z episodes on GASP VHS!), but I hope they move forward with the Buu Saga.",1326844800,,405,4.2727272727272725

4534208,5,B0053O8AZA,I love this version of DBZ.  I like that they cut out the filler which to me was hit or miss.  Its great for a fan of DBZ.,1319500800,,122,3.3214285714285716
4534209,5,B0053O8AZA,"Just continuing my reviews of the DBZ Kai releases as I watch them. I've been watching since the late 90s when I was still in high school. Bought the sixth part on Blu-Ray. As I mentioned in the other reviews, the Blu-Ray is very crisp and clean, which is a blessing and a curse for an anime drawn in the early to mid 90s. I compare it to the previous DVD releases, not the DVD version of Kai.

There are some odd cuts in this part, more noticeable than in the previous sections. I figure it is due to the larger amount of unnecessary content. Often one character will be doing one thing, then the next time you see them they are in a different place, or doing something different for no apparent reason. If you watch the old DVDs or VHS series then you see where and why the cuts were made. These cuts are most noticeable though in those slow episodes. In the busier episodes, things seem to be more cohesive.

There is new English and Japanese dubbing. I enjoy both. The translation for the English was updated, sometimes with better results, sometimes with silly results (such as Cell continuing to ask Piccolo to 'show me' and such). But the more grown up translation is nice. It's fun to hear Krillin yell 'damn' or Goku call someone a 'bastard'. The music has all been remastered and even on the English dubbed track, the Japanese score is featured. Since they do make cuts from the original, even the Japanese music score had to be edited. I did like the American soundtrack for the Cell saga, so I wish they could have had that, but that would have required much more time for Funimation to rework the music to work for this edit.

The first disc in this set features a lot of 'getting there' episodes. There is one battle between Piccolo and Cell which was shortened quite a bit (remember the army showed up in the original... doesn't happen on this version). The first disc ends with the amazing battle between 17 and Piccolo. Disc two leads us into the transformation of Cell with pretty much non stop action.

I must say that I am a fan of this release. I was a huge fan of the Cell and Cell Games sagas and I remember quite a bit of the dialogue and action (from the old VHS dubs) and I am glad that this keeps true to the heart of the series. Also of note: with the new English dubbing, 16, 18, and Cell have very different sounding voices, so it takes a bit of getting used to with the new dubs. The voice acting for Goku, Trunks, Krillin, Gohan, Piccolo and Vegeta are pretty true to the original.

Watch in either English or Japanese, both are excellent. Just beware the intro and ending song in English sound weird. Listen to them in Japanese to see what I mean.

Well worth picking up for any DBZ fan young or old.

----

Also of note: The places where Toei made the cuts and edits are becoming more obvious now. You really kind of notice it for example, when Piccolo is talking on the lookout in his torn battle clothing then they show Tien, then Piccolo again, yet this time he has his shiny new outfit on. Since I have the original DVDs I have been watching the new release and going back and re-watching the old release. It is during these episodes where I start to think the original US release may have been slightly better quality (dubbing, music, and more content). I still enjoy this release immensely and do not regret purchasing at all.",1317859200,,3366,4.3744

The replacement music (DBZ's BGM) was an excellent choice for Toei to do, than using tracks from the DBZ games that were never heard of on the TV series.

Part Six was fun to watch compared to Dragon Ball Z it stripped down most of the filler and only contained most of the action packed fights as expected (more true to the manga than the DBZ anime series), Kenji Yamamoto's music (Dragon Ball Kai's BGM) was definitely great for the series as it was intended but got replaced with Shunsuke Kikuchi's (Dragon Ball Z BGM) due to plagiarism, as I always prefer to listen to the original DBZ BGM than anything else on a Dragon Ball game/series.

Sixth Part of Dragon Ball Kai was great but, it still left us stalled with Cell's Semi-Perfect Form (Second Form), so we'll see his Final Form / Perfect Cell on Part Seven and finally Part Eight.

And lastly, the video quality is as always, superb to see, the subtitles are in white.

You won't regret buying Dragon Ball Kai: Part Six on Blu-ray!

Update:

1. Added DBZK Parts 1-6 to the gallery and inside of the Blu it comes with Vegeta's image, subs are in white.

2. Please disregard the extra part of the review from the upcoming episode 93/98, I posted some inaccurate info about Gohan's scene towards Cell.",1316304000,10,1495,4.507407407407407
4534211,5,B0053O8AZA,I own part 1 to 5 of the kai series and Funimation did something right for a change.  I used to own the Dragonball Z entire collection until I sold them all because I was getting tired of the long storylines.  After watching the Kai series it has gotten interested in it again like watching it all over for the first time.  After watching the trailer for part six I saw the new animation sequences and I cant wait to watch it on Blu-ray.,1315526400,,437,4.178571428571429
4534212,5,B0053O8AZA,"I'm just chimming in here to enlighten the user's review complaining about how this series is missing a lot of all the footage. That's the point, in fact the point is to release the exact story like that Akira Toyiama had entended the series to be shown. Each episode is the exact retelling of his creations from the Manga's/comic's in Japan. I find this waaayyyy better beacuse you don't have all the crappy fillers and useless screen panning. There's even new animation to ensure that the panel frames that were in the manga aren't missed.

The laungage has improved as well, where dangit was the worst word they ever said in Dragon ball Z.

The musical sound track is even the original japanese audio as well, also a bonus for those hard core fans.

Enjoy",1315440000,,758,4.6
4534213,5,B0053O8AZA,"Dragon ball z kai is the remastered version of dragon ball z, aka no filler, spanning from the saiyan arc to the cell arc.
Remastered in HD, the quality is good but its got a slight blur to it which is to be expected because it comes from 16mm film that was made in the 80s.
The dialogue is completely redone and funimation has put a lot more effort into dragon ball z kai than the other Dragon ball Series.
The music has also been redone but due to legal issues the music had to be replaced by the original music used in dragon ball z. This started in part 5.
Part 6 hasn't been released yet so from what i can see from the picture:
It consists from episode 66 to 77, which is ""12"" episodes.
From the trailer it shows that cell finally appears.
I'm assuming that the next part will only have 11 episodes(78 to 88) and the following one will have 10 episodes(89 to 98). Which means a total of 8 parts.
Dragon ball z kai overall is better than the original dragon ball z series but its starting to lose points with the music being replaced by the original music, so it takes away from the new generation feel to it but that sadly can't be helped and that it ends at the cell arc instead of the buu arc.",1314835200,,1201,4.114893617021276
4534214,5,B0053O8AZA,"The sixth installment of dragon ball z kai in North America releases on Setember 13/2011 for a price of $18.99 on blu ray and $16.99 on dvd on Amazon. These sets will contain Kikuchi's score as will for the rest of the parts. This sets utilizes the same packaging as the other releases already out. This is also the first time that one of the sets does not contain 13 episodes, instead this set only has 11 episodes.

Nothing really spectacular sticks out compared dragon ball z kai part 3 which contained a interview with the voice actors which I thought was cool and would have liked if they kept doing those.

Nothing else I can really tell you except for the episode listings. **Note these are the titles listed in Japan translated into english.

So...tell me fans. What are you most looking foward to in this release? I know I'm looking foward to the appearence of Super Vegeta uncut in filler free scripts. I also wanted to point this out.
