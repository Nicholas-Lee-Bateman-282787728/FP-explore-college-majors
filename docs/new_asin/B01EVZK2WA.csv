7740954,1,B01EVZK2WA,"SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS

Tim is an arrogant but charming high-school student with an ego the size of Australia, where he lives. He decides he wants shy jock classmate John as his lover. He gets what he wants (he always does) and rips apart both families in the process. Having gotten John all to himself, Tim decides he ""owes it to himself"" to play around, so he ditches John and ends up in drama school. He ""experiences"" numerous known and unknown partners, picks up the AIDS virus, and eventually tugs on trusty, faithful, genuinely loving John's leash so he can pass the virus to him. John dies, slowly, and in agony, while Tim (by now a C-list actor) plays the role of tender caregiver. The end.

Thank God, it's not really the end, because Tim has the virus too and dies a couple of years later. Good riddance to bad rubbish. HE deserved it. John didn't.

Knowing that he didn't waltz on to other C-list triumphs on the coattails of John's death is the only thing that keeps me from really, really despising this extremely well-produced and mostly well-acted movie. I loved the beginning, when it seemed that the two boys really loved each other, but when Tim started his scumbag, selfish acting out, I revolted. What a jerk. What a vile, loathsome, self-aggrandizing, self-serving jerk. I'm glad Tim Conigrave is dead.",1488153600,3,1327,4.735930735930736
7740955,5,B01EVZK2WA,"The beginning of this movie requires a heavy suspension of disbelief  the same actors play the two main characters for the entirety of the movie, starting around age 16 and going to their 30s. The actors are probably in their late 20s/30s, and having them play the 16-year-old versions is unbelievable to an almost goofy degree. If you can deal with how obviously they are not 16-year-olds, the story will quickly engross you and it soon moves on to them slightly older, where the actors are much more believable in their roles. And you should try to deal with how bad the 16-year-old scenes are, because this movie is fantastic. While the film definitely follows a somewhat overdone gay-movie-plot trope, it is carried out beautifully. The emotionality and chemistry between the actors is so fantastic it almost justifies the terrible choice to use them for the all ages in the movie, and the various storylines come together without being either overly simplistic or leaving you wondering why something was never addressed.",1487376000,,1025,4.994152046783626

7740969,4,B01EVZK2WA,"Note: this review has some very light and general spoilers that probably won't be much news to those who know enough about the story to be reading about it here.

An extremely well intended adaptation of Timothy Conigave's memoir of the great love of life set in Australia in the 70s, 80s, and early 90s. The film did make me cry. And it was nice to see a gay love story where both the deep romance and intense sexuality of these two men were treated as utterly normal by the film -- if not by the society the two men were living in at the time. I also appreciate the way it pulled no punches on showing the devastating physical effects of AIDS in the days where treatment options were pathetically limited and ineffective. So there is much going for it.

But, frustratingly, some of that good stuff is off-set with cinematic miss-steps, at least to my eyes: E.g. Casting Aussie stars Guy Pearce, Kerry Fox, and Geoffrey Rush in cameos so small that their presence seems more weird and distracting than involving (Anthony LaPaglia also takes a small role, but one with enough meat that at least his presence seems to make sense).

Overuse of period songs: To a point this device worked well, but soon it started to feel like every other scene had a familiar period pop song as score  most a little too on-the-nose in their lyrics or meaning. This is a particular flaw at the very end of the film, when the crashing in of an up-tempo pop song short-circuits a moment of great emotional intensity I would have liked to have been able to sit with and emotionally experience.

And while it's great that a gay love story can now feel little different than a straight one in style, that's maybe not great when that style sometimes feels as familiar and mainstream as any slightly bland Hollywood movie. Add to that, some of the worst age make up I can remember seeing in a long time (trying desperately to make two very adult looking actors come off as teenagers at the start of the story), and a tendency to skip too quickly over the character elements of these two men that weren't directly about their relationship -- so that even after over 2 hours I felt frustrated that I didn't know more about these two as individuals -- which would have given added shape to the story of how their lives joined into one.

A worthwhile and admirable film, but one that I couldn't quite get myself to love, no matter how much I wanted to.",1482192000,11,2422,4.468325791855204

7740972,3,B01EVZK2WA,"Just got to watch the movie and open the DVD weeks after it arrived and found the disc loose and horribly scratched up in its container. That is why I am giving it a three star rating because of poor shipping. Luckily, the disc played the whole movie and only got stuck toward the end of the credits. Read online that there was something at the end and was able to search for that last little snippet from the movie.
It was a good love story and the actors did look like the real life Tim and John. They did look a little ""oldish"" when they first met but It worked well overall to keep the same actors to tell the story from their beginning to the end. Also appreciated seeing the AIDS epidemic from another country's perspective. I recommend We Were Here and A Normal Heart to get the American POV.

This is my review. First off, the cast is great and works beautifully together, a true ensemble. Anthony LaPaglia delivers another powerful performance. No wonder the guy has list of awards and nominations two pages long. Camilla Ah Kin, Kerry Fox, and Guy Pearce also deliver first-rate performances. Again, no wonder each actor has a list of awards and nominations several pages long. Ryan Corr, well, if he is in real life anything like his character, Tim, he must be a blast to hang with outside of work. However, his acting is multifaceted and convincing. However, the star from my perspective was Craig Stott. His portrayal of John Caleo was amazing. He portrays a gay man that doesn't but being gay first. Brian shows us a good person, who just happens to be gay, no stereotyping, just an honest guy that happens to love another guy.

7740979,5,B01EVZK2WA,"Just finished watching ""Holding The Man"" released by Strand Releasing.
Perhaps one of the greatest love stories of the late 20th Century, ""Holding The Man"" is the biographical movie of the life of Australian author/actor/activist Timothy Conigrove and how he met the great love of his life - John Coleo - based on the same biography written and completed by Conigrove just ten days before his death from complications due to AIDS.
Like Conigrove's autobiography, the screen adaptation of ""Holding The Man"" doesn't sugar coat the emotional and physical relationship between Conigrove and Coleo.  There are times when viewers will want to reach into the movie and slap Conigrove for being such a prick.
How Conigrove and Coleo first met in high school, where Conigrove was attached to a handsome Coleo, who was captain of the rugby team.  It's hinted, though I have yet to read the book, that Coleo would have never considered having a same-sex relationship if Conigrove hadn't pursued a friendship and then romance.  In fact, Conigrove writes a rather moving apology to Coleo after his hand strays a bit to far - it's a letter that almost gets both boys expelled, but a Jesuit priest intervenes on their behalf.
Eventually Conigrove and Coleo become intimate and are discovered at first by their fiends, who are okay with their romance, and their parents - who aren't.  Coleo's parents threaten legal action.
Still, the two young men defy their parents and remain monogamous, until Conigrove wants to taste the honey that is out there and have an open relationship - which Coleo refuses to do.
Ultimately the two split up; but after a series of one-night stands, Conigrove realizes he has nothing without Coleo and the two reunite.  Only Conigrove's wanderings have caused him to catch AIDS and he inadvertently gave it to Coleo.
Coleo's decline is heartbreaking to watch.  Conigrove's own decline is a far gentler one.  After Coleo's death, Conigrove has to endure the agony and humiliation of being referred to only as Coleo's friend - despite that fact that he stood up to his family and told them that he loves Conigrove.
Conigrove leaves Australia and finds a refuge in Italy where he is writing his biography as a love letter to Coleo and even finds himself falling for a boy who works at a resort to ease the loneliness.
A Grand Sweeping Romance!

7740992,5,B01EVZK2WA,"What a beautiful and breath-taking movie... Where to begin? I initially watched this movie, with the only knowledge that it was about a gay romance. I was not prepared for this movie. It was an emotional roller coaster and I was overcome by pure emotion, heartache and joy. I cannot remember the last time I cried this much or felt so alive. I was covered in tears by the end of it. The acting was superb, and both Ryan Corr (who is straight) and Craig Stott delivered some of the most touching, vivid and stellar performances I have ever seen. And the chemistry the two shared felt so real and palpable. I cannot thank them, nor the rest of those involved in this film, enough for the treasure they have given us. Though this movie is first and foremost about gay love and romance, there are scenes with sex and nudity which could make some uncomfortable, though definitely nothing even close to porn - this movie isn't a porno, not in the slightest. It is, on the other hand, a beautiful true story about the love that two young men found and shared in Australia in the 70s-90s. It deals with so many issues the LGBTQ community dealt with back then and still faces now: coming out, growing up in religious families, prejudice, trying to make a stand/difference, dealing with AIDS and loss... After a week of watching the film, I am still haunted by the scenes I saw and, though shaken, I feel honored to have been able to share in something so intimate and real. This is a must-see film inspired and based on a memoir of the same name by Tim Conigrave (which only makes the film all the more meaningful as none of it is fiction). As the movie left me absolutely shocked and devastated (in the best way), I don't think I could handle the more-detailed book. One day, some day, I will muster up the courage and read it. I highly recommend this movie not only to the LGBTQ community, but to everyone as it will change the way you see gay love and it displays beautifully the kind of true love two people can share, in the case two young men. Everything I said until now is but an understatement - you will have to see this for yourself (regardless of your sexual orientation) to experience and understand what I wrote.",1475366400,4,2217,4.436274509803922
7740993,5,B01EVZK2WA,"A beautifully moving and well recounted story of love, commitment, lust, disappointment, and activism. The script is beautifully written, telling a true story spanning a couple of different eras: from the early days of gay liberation and the ensuing AIDS crisis. This film captures some important moments in our history as a community. Though some people might find this film tragic, the story is more about the power of love through some very painful times. I appreciated the accessibility of the characters, the quality of the acting, and the moving story-line that engaged me all the way through. I smiled a lot, laughed some, and was moved to tears. A great soundtrack accompanies the film, giving it just the right touch to make the film that much more engaging. And the cinematography is exquisite! I wanted to see this film when it came to our local LGBT film festival but was not able to squeeze it in. I'm very glad I saw it now and will recommend it to friends. It will stay with me a while.",1475193600,9,1001,4.661016949152542

7741003,4,B01EVZK2WA,"My daughter told me about Holding the Man. She heard about it from Netflix. The movie was quite personal to me as I have lost two men I have loved, love still and will love until I draw my last breath. Maybe even after that. Both men died after 8 years of battling diseases that had only one ending. Terry died in 1995 due to the ravages of young-onset Parkinson's disease  - just two weeks before his 41st birthday. Vic died four months ago due to ravages of old age dementia and a life well-lived. He was 87. We would have celebrated our 19th year together this month. I wept right along with Tim as he wept for the loss of John. The realities of life are far more difficult, but far better stories than made-up movie plots.

The movie also had special meaning to me as I was just coming out during the same time period after a 20 plus years Navy career. AIDS/HIV was nightly news in the DC area where I was working. Fortunately, given all the craziness and chances I took in my mid-life crisis, I did not end up positive.

It was triumphant, yet I long for a movie where there is a positive, affirming ending to it.  This had that, but in a tragic way.

7741022,4,B01EVZK2WA,"*warning-some spoilers ahead*

Watching Holding the Man has got to be one of the most gut wrenching experiences, yet at the same time leaves a lasting impression.  While some elements of the film is flawed - at times very stage play (the reference to Romeo and Juliet is too obvious) and the central actors attempting to look 16 when clearly older - the film perfectly captures all elements of growing up and coming out in Australia in the 70s-90s.  What sets this film apart from others is that it's a true story, and a tragic one at that.

It's good to see the film not gloss over Tim's selfishness and the tragic results of his behaviour, and does not shy away from some of the gritty realism of Tim's and John's struggles to stay together, be together, and support each other at the most toughest of times.  The arc of the story emphasises that the core of the film is a true love story, whether it be the way John adoringly looks at Tim and never once blames him for the chaos he brings to their lives, or the moment when Tim comes to realise that he has 'killed the man I love'. You want to hate Tim, yet his genuine and real anguish at a key moment leaves you feeling just as shattered.  The parents' reactions to their coming out, seeing their relationships develop and the horror of what happens to them, is genuine, real and very close to the bone.  While their mothers fight for acceptance, Anthony Lapaglia's performance is the most powerful in struggling to find acceptance and understanding when it is all but too late. If only Guy Pearce was given a greater role.

Knowing that the story has a tragic ending makes the viewing experience uncomfortable, yet its lasting impression makes it a truly beautiful experience.  This film would make anyone - gay or straight- appreciate the value of life, and those they love.",1472688000,4,1831,4.541033434650456

7741058,5,B01EVZK2WA,"A complex and incisive ""gay love story"" set against the chronological backdrop of 1976-1994. With an all star cast, such as Guy Pearce, Anthony LaPaglia, Kerry Fox, and Geoffrey Rush in just the secondary roles, this is a realistically and brilliantly written and acted film. Beginning with their high school days, two young men - one a captain of the football team and the other an aspiring drama student and would be actor - finally acknowledge their mutual feelings and create an enduring relationship over a 15 year period.  As in life - and this film is actually based upon the autobiography of one of the two men, Timothy Conigrove (played by Ryan Corr) and his love affair with John Coleo (played by Craig Stott) - there are many ups and downs. Unfortunately, a monogamous commitment is not easily sustained, and the eventual wanderlust of one of the two main protagonists proves to be literally fatal to their relationship.  How this is overcome; how the two are able to reconcile and be accepted by their individual families and remain faithful and devoted to each to the very end comprises the true heart of this story. The acting is especially credible on all levels and the entire story is presented in such an intelligent manner that it avoids any melodrama. It is not possible to be unmoved by this film and it is definitely not manipulative. Be prepared to shed a few tears. But a story well told is worth it.",1470614400,16,1424,4.692

For those who lived through the early years of AIDS, this film version of the memoir by Timothy Conigrave, reconstructed here, may not be pleasant and may in fact elicit pain. This film integrates all of the political and cultural texts and subtexts of the time. However,
if viewers can hold this context and setting in a somewhat detached mode, they will be rewarded with a story of compassion, commitment and courage. True love is what many, perhaps most individuals hope for and the rarefied atmosphere and time shared by those whose good fortune bestows it, are blessed; and I should think they are forever blessed regardless of however long or short that time may be.
