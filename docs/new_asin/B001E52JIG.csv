I was wrong, this was one of the worst spanish horror films I have ever viewed. The price for the movie is waaaay to high at most retailers and not worth the price of a discount dvd at Wal-Mart. Skip it please.",1367193600,,357,3.9722222222222223
8296383,4,B001E52JIG,"This movie was so much fun to see, it has everything you want in sensless horror. In the vein of from dusk till dawn, 2 bit criminals apparentely escape from prison, kidnap a very sexy woman and proceeed to raise hell in hopes of avenging some stolen drug money. Needless to say its gangsta zombie violence with as the title translates lots of blood flows. Perfect saturday night movie fun.",1283644800,3,390,4.585714285714285

Mucha Sangre has been called a Spanish homage to Peter Jackson's infamous film Bad Taste. While I'm a fan of Peter Jackson's, I still haven't seen Bad Taste, so I can't comment on the validity of that statement, but I thought I'd throw it out there for those of you who have. Jackson's following is such that such a statement alone is probably an automatic recommendation. If you haven't seen it, though, worry not thy little head; Mucha Sangre is all sorts of good clean gory fun. As long as you're a gore film fan, you'll have a blast with this piece of silliness.

Spanish horror film icon Paul Naschy (who kicked off his career in the late sixties Waldemar Daninsky flicks and worked right up until his 2009 death; his final two films will be appearing later this year) gets top billing here, but the actual principals in the film are Choro (Rodolfo Sancho, who teamed up with Naschy again in the latter's final film, La Herencia Valdemar) and Cortaojos (Txema Sandoval, a veteran of low-budget Spanish sex comedies). The two of them escape from prison and just happen to stumble upon Iciar (El Desenlace's Isabel del Toro), suffering from car trouble and provocatively dressed. Ain't life grand? They kidnap her (after fixing the car, natch) and head out to complete Cortaojos' grand plan: getting back in good graces with his old boss Vicuna (Naschy). Problem is, Vicuna and his gang no longer have any need for their old pal; in fact, they're much happier without him. You see, Vicuna and his bunch have found themselves a new line of work. Telling you what would spoil the fun, but listen to the radio bulletins in the background for much of the first half of the movie and you'll have an idea where this is going.

First off, to get maximum enjoyment out of the flick, you have to be aware that it's a spoof. If you go into it expecting an actual horror movie, you're guaranteed to think it sucks. It's all about paying homage to eighties horror films, everything from Return of the Living Dead to the early Peter Jackson flicks (as mentioned above) to Jimmy Mura's Street Trash, so the more bad eighties horror movies you've seen, the more in-jokes you're going to get. And just suspend your disbelief right out of the gate (like I said, you break out of prison and five minutes later run into a chick with car trouble wearing a bustier?), because the longer the movie goes, the more outrageous it gets. Surprisingly for a movie like this, there's not all that much gore until you get to the final half-hour, but once you do, you're talking about FX guys throwing buckets of the stuff around, so gorehounds will get their fill. As long as you come into it in the right frame of mind, you'll have a blast. *** ",1281052800,4,2759,4.567676767676768
