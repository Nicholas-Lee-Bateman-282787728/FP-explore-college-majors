1236712,4,B00000JQVY,I saw this film about 8 years ago during a film preview and evening with the writers of the film.  It has great elements to it and having family from Boston brings it closer to home.,1141171200,,182,4.055555555555555
1236713,3,B00000JQVY,"Although while not cinematically the greatest film, this is a good film.  I was prompted to review based on other reviewers, particularly those with ""close ties"" to Southie or who've never been there, regarding the authenticity of the way life is in Southie.  This movie is so true to how ""died in the wool"" Southie Irish families are that I found myself at one point wondering whether I knew any of these characters from back in the day!  They certainly reminded me of a lot of the guys I used to date in high school and their families.  Also, the Irish mob is very present in Southie and yes, it's mostly backroom stuff.  Just ask anyone who plays the numbers!  They are a backroom, leather jacket, scully wearing bunch of scary guys.  This is a very accurate representation of many of the families and folks in Southie (trying not to generalize of course).  Also, the fact that most of the actors are from Boston helped keep the accent believable.  Ya, Boston accents are annoying, but they are ten times worse when someone is faking it.  So if you are looking for an independent film, a modern day gangster film that will give you a pretty true to life glimpse at the South Boston culture, you'll probably like this film.",1137888000,39,1225,4.552511415525114
1236714,4,B00000JQVY,"After watching 'Southie' I was surprised at its low rating on the IMDb; and somewhat puzzled because almost everyone who took the time to post a comment found it an excellent film. Although in overall effect it is not on the level of 'Mean Streets', it a still a very solid production; on the level of ""Monument Avenue"" and ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"". I suppose that a rather ordinary screenplay and a downbeat ending put some people off.

But this small film did a fine job of presenting a believable (if troubled) family, it utilized some interesting (out of favor) camera techniques to advance the storyline, and it showcased some excellent acting. It is refreshing to watch something without a hint of computer generated crap. If your production fundmentals are sound you don't need that kind of distraction.

There are two diametrically opposite scenes between Donnie Wahlberg and Rose McGowan that work so well that you wonder why they didn't alter the script to expand McGowan's part . One is in an Irish bar where Danny convinces his sister to enter an in-patient alcohol treatment program. The other is a few days later when he visits her in the middle of the program. The contrast between the intensity levels of these two scenes is amazing and McGowan pulls off the dramatic performance of her career. She is great at comedy but in these scenes she shows unexpected dramatic range. 'Southie' would be worth watching for just these two scenes but it is a solid effort from start to finish. Highly recommended.",1119744000,23,1521,4.801526717557252
1236715,5,B00000JQVY,"It's ironical because my name is also Joe Ward.  I loved this film!!!!! I grew up in Southie, but I saw a lot of myself in Wahlburg's character, and not just because we share the same name.  Waste no time in adding this gem to your collection.

J-Double",1107388800,5,253,4.229166666666667
1236716,4,B00000JQVY,"This is a pretty good film about South Boston. It shows the mean streets of Southie and the gangsters who inhabit them realistically. The story centers around the vicious Irish gangs that run the neighboorhoods, and how (unlike thier laughable Italian counterparts)the Irish mob is a truly dangerous and brutal group of people. The film is also a great showpiece for Whalberg and McGowan, both of whom are great in the fil. The director John Shea is pretty impressive here, and we need more Irish-American filmakers to aspire to the level of excellence shown by the great Scorsesse.",1095120000,18,582,4.948979591836735
1236717,5,B00000JQVY,I loved it.  Donnie is an amazing actor.  If you like Donnie as much as I do or South Boston get it.  The movie takes you through the life of South Boston and you can't stop watching it.  I say that everyone should get it.  Especially if you are a Wahlberg fan.,947808000,4,261,3.9423076923076925

1236798,3,B00000JQVY,Donnie Wahlberg was pretty good in this but the story and supporting cast were weak and McGowan only has a small insignificant part. For a 1998 film set in Brooklyn it looks authentic but the portrayal of the crime figures wasn't. Overall not a bad film but could have been much better.,1465430400,,286,4.519230769230769

I had trouble not smiling at the Donnie Wahlberg facial hair and hair style, but the feeling of grit in ""Southie"" seems authentic. Ann Meara is a delight!  Would say a ""must see"" for Wahlberg family fans just like ""Cry Baby"" is a must for Depp buffs.  Mark gets a lot of press,  but Donnie has it goin'.",1464652800,,484,4.274725274725275

1237145,5,B00000JQVY,"This award winner captures the real feel of South Boston better than most films shot there. First released in 1998, this drama, about an Irish American family caught in the crossfire of the Irish mob, helped launch the careers of young actors Donnie Wahlberg, Rose McGowan, Amanda Peet, and Will Arnet, and mixed in strong performances from veteran character actors Anne Meara, who plays Whalberg's mother, and Lawrence Tierney who plays the Whitey Bulger-like Irish mob boss. Many of the smaller roles were played by people that the director cast from the neighborhood, or by Boston born actors like Jimmy Cummings, Josh Marchette, Sue Costello, Lenny Clarke,  Steve Sweeney, Steve Koslowski, and Bob Whalberg, whose close to the street performances help make the film authentic. Southie was the first film shot entirely in South Boston; a film critic said that it had the ""ring of truth"". If you want to see what ""the toughest neighborhood in America"" felt like before gentrification changed it forever, Southie is a great film to see, with a strong performance by Wahlberg in his first starring role.",1447459200,2,1103,5.06043956043956

1237147,1,B00000JQVY,"This is another flop of a movie like so many others which were created on the coattails of Goodwill Hunting and subjected to the general public.  The cinematography is awful, it is NOT an accurate depiction of the gentrified and yuppy Southie that once was but also represents the one-dimensional views and abilities of a soft, nerdy type, Dave McLaughlin who wrote this and spent over a decade trying to get ""street cred"" after growing up in West Roxbury and couldn't resist a piece of low-hanging fruit with a compelling title name.  That is almost 2 hours of my life I will never get back.  Fortunately, I took a short nap :-).  I think we all know why Donnie and not the more accomplished Bostonian (Dorchester) brother didn't make this mess.  If he had it would be called, ""DOT"" and hopefully better written.  It looks, feels and comes off ""cheap"" and this is nothing more than another non-authentic medium in which the rest of the world has to see what ""Southie"" really is not.  If any viewer thinks and digs deep down they have seen this story before and everything in the plot before, just without the poor accents and definitely with a better cast.  The casting is typical.  Not only from the mediocre stars but adding Lenny Clarke and other local flops, this really is a passion piece from a writer who belongs at a horse track with the blinders he wears creatively speaking.  Rose McGowan surprisingly is at times refreshingly talented and this is an unfortunate glitch in her resume she will quickly outlive.

1237162,5,B00000JQVY,"the movie was done on many levels, but the basic theme was of one man making a comeback through very hard odds. of course Mark Wahlberg plays his usual great character. it is a movie to be appreciated, as well as ask questions about. One would be, how far would one go to change, and be a better person. it is real in the sense that he, at one point did give up, but then came back and followed through with what he had to do. in real life this would be very difficult, if not impossible, in the movie it gives the person hope that it could be done. as i said this is a gritty story, but it does help the average person realize that in life there are choices to be made and all of us, whoever we are can rise above a situation and conquer our fears. sounds very dramatic, but t thought the director did very well in getting the point across, again i am not the final word on this subject. but i look at a movie and want to get something out of it, and this one did that.",1373760000,,970,3.954081632653061

What he finds is that his sister (perfectly-cast Rose McGowan) has become an alcoholic, one of his brothers owes money to a local mob boss, and his mother's health is deteriorating. Not a bad outing for director John Shea using what he can with a low production to capture that profane, drunken, and violent environment that a certain underbelly of the neighborhood has always been known for.

1237193,2,B00000JQVY,"We get it. You Bostonians are a tough breed of pissed-off Irishmen. That doesn't mean we want to watch your movies, i.e., The Departed, Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, Boondock Saints, etc.

Southie is right up there with the best of 'em, trying its darndest to take off from the nest of predictability and poorly-crafted screen writing but finding itself falling back to earth in pathetic fashion with each new failed attempt.

What's funny is that Bostonian filmmakers are constantly trying to reinforce the tough guy tone that goes with their collective neighborhoods back home. Where Chicago filmmakers constantly try to portray their cities humor and New York filmmakers take every opportunity to reinforce their godlike status in the world, Boston filmmakers have a habit of flexing their muscles in every new piece of piss-poor filmmaking. We get it: you guys are tougher than us, more important than us, and more educated than us (tongue meet cheek). But, your films still suck and your inferiority complex to New York City will always keep the rest of the nation laughing.

In case you are truly one of the Irish mafia, please note that this review was written out of humor, so please don't hunt me down and kill me. Thanks!",1212019200,3,1231,4.880382775119617
1237194,5,B00000JQVY,"This is another film that you sometimes overlook, but nonetheless decide to take it home and try it. I am glad I did. Southie is a gritty and emotional crime drama revolves around life in South Boston. Danny Quinn played by Donnie Wahlberg comes home after a stint in prison and decides to make a positive go at his life. He does have to deal with an alcoholic sister, and a family basically on the verge of total collapse.

I'm not overly familiar with Boston nor am I Irish, but that should not a prerequisite for watching and enjoying this movie. I will say that even though this film gave me a microscopic view of Irish working class life and one which is criminal in nature due to the story, it is not an overall representative view of most Irish Americans, who from my own personal experience, are good, proud and passionate people.

I will say that even though Donnie may not be as popular or successful as his brother Mark, he is an actor that has truly demonstrated that he can excel and shine in his own right.
