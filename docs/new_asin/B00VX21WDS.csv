7113572,4,B00VX21WDS,"I bought this merely to see the clip of Duane Eddy & the Rebels performing.  I am still a big fan of Duane's.  Had an old VHS low quality copy of this movie I wanted to replace.  Dick Clark did a good job of acting for his first time, but the plot is pretty lame as might be expected.  It does give a good insight to movie-making and a slice of time for that period.",1436054400,10,366,3.84

7113574,4,B00VX21WDS,"A blast from my past.  I saw this on it's initial release.  However it never seems to surface on TV.  The theme song performed by Duane Eddy does make the rounds on radio and CD collections. Great fun to see the performers when ""they WERE young"".",1449100800,4,246,4.304347826086956
7113575,3,B00VX21WDS,not what i thought it was but ok for the time and the acting rec. it in new condition!,1444003200,,86,3.5789473684210527
7113576,3,B00VX21WDS,"A movie from its time period. Not more than that. I merely bought it for much too short performance by Duane Eddy - 1 track - ""Shazam"". As I am a big fan of Duane so this one was a treat. It's a pity thou he didn't perform the title track ""Because They're Young"" while being on stage . When it comes to Dick Clark he does his part OK but the character he's playing seems much too meek - even for the time period. Well,that's my opinion anyway.  The picture quality's perfect, as expected from the remastered original film. And so is the sound track.",1444003200,6,549,4.179245283018868
7113577,5,B00VX21WDS,Excellent movie I didn't know dick Clark was in movies but he was in this one and he was really good I recommend it to anyone DW,1443484800,4,128,3.7777777777777777
7113578,5,B00VX21WDS,"Vintage movie for anyone who loves nostalgia.  See Dick Clark, Tuesday Weld, Roberta Shore, Doug McClure, and a host of others in their early years.  The story line is great, and the acting is believable.  A great evening's entertainment.",1442275200,7,238,5.051282051282051

7113580,5,B00VX21WDS,GREAT MOVIE BY pHILADELPHIA  OWN  DICK  CLARK MADE  DURING BANDSTAND WHEN IT WAS IN PHILA,1440547200,,89,4.733333333333333
7113581,1,B00VX21WDS,"I bought this for the music of Duane Eddy, as in  those days we could only see these artists when they were on Bandstand, in a movie or at a R & R show, if we were lucky to have one; he only played one tune and it wasn't even the title tune.  I didn't expect too much from the movie and I got even less as  it was even worse then I expected.  I suppose if you liked goofy ""love"" movies without a plot or good acting, you might like this. I'm glad that I missed this when it first came out.",1438473600,2,489,3.7184466019417477
7113582,3,B00VX21WDS,"'Way back in 1959, Amercican Bandstand was the Hottest show on daytime TV and it's host, Dick Clark was a TV Star, so, Columbia Pictures built a movie around Clark. They cast him as a schoolteacher thereby surrounding him with teenagers played by some of the rising stars of the time. Sexy Tuesday Weld and Bad Boy Michael Callan were the lead troubled teens supported by pretty Roberta Shore and Hunky Doug McClure as the ""Good"" couple. Warren Berlinger is the teen with the wanton Mom. I guess I could have called this movie Hollywood High School Confidential or High School Photoplay, but I think you catch my drift. Everybody in this movie is pretty to look at except for the parents and authority figures. Everybody is as white as Wonder Bread. I think I saw one Asian boy in the high school dance sequence. Instead of ""Rock Around the Clock"" or ""Boppin' at the High School Hop"" we get a syrupy ballad ""Because they're young"" sung by James Darren. Duane Eddy and his rebels perform ""Shazam"". I only bought this because of the cast, all of whom I remeber well. Some have gone on to their reward, notably Clark and McClure, but, unless you were fans of any of the above, you can take away one star and skip this one.",1436313600,4,1219,4.495495495495495
8711606,5,B00VX21WDS,"I really like this film.  Early 60's squeaky clean troubled teens film.  Dick Clark, who almost looks like a teen himself, plays a caring teacher who is hampered by all the powers-that-be at the school, including his love interest, the school secretary.  The teen I most felt for is Tuesday Weld.  Apparently she did the deed with Michael Callan the summer before, and her mistake is returning to haunt her.  It's clear she was looking for someone to truly love her.  Her home life is a downer.  A hypochondriac mother who is never seen but definitely HEARD.  This harridan spends her time in bed shrieking at her daughter to be her servant and throwing her mistakes in her face.  She even seems to resent her daughter going to school when daughter should be waiting on her mommy hand-and-foot.  A father who spends practically every waking hour at the office to escape his warm, nurturing shrew of a wife.  Good musical numbers at a prom by Duane Eddy and James Darren.  The town butcher is a disturbing character.  He leads some no good teens in criminal activities, but that is not the most troubling aspect of his character.  He comes across as too chummy with the young men, in a brutish, unhealthy way.  The Mill Creek Entertainment DVD is surprisingly very good quality.  Highly recommended.",1489276800,2,1298,4.727678571428571
8711607,4,B00VX21WDS,"This movie is based on the book ""Harrison High"", from the 1950's.  The makers of the movie did a good job with the adaptation, but they ""cleaned up"" some of the story.  The white-washed version of the story is still very watchable, but it does not have the same impact as the book.  The actors all do a good job, even a very young looking Dick Clark.",1479772800,,350,4.1940298507462686

8711611,5,B00VX21WDS,"Dick Clark is classic, and I purchased this for my grandfather as a Christmas gift. He was extremely happy to receive it and we put it on immediately while everyone else was still opening presents.

It was entertaining to see that no matter how different each generation thinks they are from the previous one there are always things that remain the same, even 55 years later.",1469836800,,375,4.681818181818182
