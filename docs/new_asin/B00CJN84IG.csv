8582682,5,B00CJN84IG,"I used to borrow this from the library all the time when I was in middle school/high school. My mom bought one back then, but now I live on my own. I haven't used it for four to six years, but starting up with Neena and Veena again was easy and awesome. The sisters are pleasant, encouraging, and they go at a slow enough pace to let you learn and catch up. I recommend their other DVDs as well.",1404259200,2,395,4.012658227848101
8582683,2,B00CJN84IG,"If you are looking for just a beginners workout as described above, then this is for you. If you are looking for belly dance moves with instruction which focus' on arms, abs and hips, this is not for you. Two stars only because I'm the latter and did look at reviews prior to buying. I do like Veena Bidasha's belly dance instructional methods on other video's and is one major reason I purchased this one.",1402358400,,406,4.426666666666667
