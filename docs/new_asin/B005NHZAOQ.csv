4847796,3,B005NHZAOQ,This is an interesting story of a pushy boss who takes credit for her associate's accomplishments and then turns the whole issue into a harassment case to work it to her own advantage.

4847814,4,B005NHZAOQ,"NOTE: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. Taut and economical thriller starring Kristen Scott Thomas and Ludivine Sagnier, respectively as the cold, ruthless and calculating executive and the aspiring understudy.  You can read the plot on Wiki and elsewhere but where the film excels is in its inherent economy, pacing and psychology.  With nary a wasted shot or special effect- and a muted musical score- Love Crime is a stark exploration of the role bullying and intimidation plays in the development of psychosis.  The Isabelle character (Sagnier) is baited and humiliated to the breaking point by her single minded boss Christine (Thomas).  After suffering a series of job disappointments at the hands of Christine, and unknowingly aided and abetted by the wayward boyfriend Phillippe's shady financial dealings, she breaks and commits the ultimate crime against her boss.

The film's only real deficiencies are the lack of exposition about both characters , with few glimpses as to their formative backgrounds or motivations.  You're pretty much offered these two as-is and basically asked to accept their defining traits.  Also, in recounting the crime, director Corneau relies a bit too heavily on a scene by scene staging and recreation of the pre-crime events.  This approach results in a tight but somewhat unconvincing recounting of Isabelle's planning of the crime.  Leaving more to the imagination would have challenged the audience in ways this story board method didn't.

Overall, a very well acted and scripted psychological thriller. Not much action, but then again the action was mostly in words and gestures.  Mostly in French with English subtitles.",1410912000,,1659,5.366795366795367
4847815,2,B005NHZAOQ,"Maybe it was the subtitles but I could not feel the chemistry - not the passion, betrayals or the hatred It just was not believable",1392422400,,131,4.28
4847816,3,B005NHZAOQ,"The final film from Alan Corneau takes place in the board room of a Parisian headquarters of a multinational. This is about a cruel executive Christine ( Kristin Scott Thomas) who is evil and plays with peoples lives by using them to her advantage. She is enthralled by Isabelle (Ludvine Sagnier) who appears to be weak.  However Isabelle is not easily manipulated because beneath that veneer lies a person that is equally malicious. The film is strictly a game of chess between the two women until Cristine makes a false move that sends Isabelle over the edge.
The movie has a surprising turn half way but patience is rewarded. Just as in a good detective tale there are a couple of red herrings but this is a decent watch.",1390348800,,724,4.612403100775194
4847817,4,B005NHZAOQ,"File this one under Guilty Pleasure.  Whether it's Kristin Scott Thomas' delicious take on corporate villainy or the absurd proposition of Ludivine Sagnier (known simply as 'The Body' in France) as a frumpy, repressed workaholic brainiac, this movie - meant as a taut thriller - is equally enjoyable for delighting in the juicy turns of its two stars.  They are clearly enjoying themselves with this material.  In turn, so did I.

The thriller hidden inside here is a pretty cool one.  Tough to say much about it without getting into spoiler alert territory but, suffice to say, Sagnier's Isabelle is one smart cookie.

I love the way writers Alain Corneau (who also directed) and Natalie Carter talk about business.  We never really find out what Barney & Johnson (the company Isabelle and Christine - Thomas' character - work for) does, but there are enough plausible meetings, proposals, outcomes, trips and deals that it doesn't really matter.  It's the business of business that Corneau and Carter give us, rather than a specific business.  I really like the way that all played out.  Well done.",1388361600,,1100,4.961748633879782
4847818,3,B005NHZAOQ,"This film opened to a promising start.  For me, the intrigue came to a halting stop after the murder.  More than half the movie seemed to be covering up a crime.  When you have a film as amazing as Basic Instinct where the entire movie was engrossing this is ""slow kill"" and almost all cover up.  The two main woman were great in their roles and I would have liked to see one not simply kill the other but instead develop in what appeared originally to be their strange & twisted ""friendship"".  If it seems like it's filled with potential when you start watching it, beware.  The worst is yet to come.",1379203200,,601,4.321428571428571

4847820,5,B005NHZAOQ,"I watched this on netflix instant last night and it was just a wonderful viewing experience.  the french do such a marvelous job on film, getting nuances down to a story unlike any other country seems able to do. the film is in a business setting with two female executives. the top one is played by kristin scott-thomas. she is taking credit for the work of the number two executive, the blonde french actress on the box. when number two starts taking credit for her own work, number one starts fighting dirty, including using a man against her with whom they have both been sleeping.  what is number two to do?  the answer to this is absolutely fascinating and you will be unable to move away from the screen as the rest of the film unfolds.  i just loved this film.  if you've had a hard day at work and need a marvelous escape for the evening, this is the film to watch!!!!!!!!

4847821,4,B005NHZAOQ,"I thoroughly enjoyed Love Crime.  It provides an intriguing look at the game of office politics as played by the top executives of the Paris office of a multinational firm.  It is intricately plotted, with a storyline that starts out simple but is actually much more complex than the viewer originally thinks.  Ludivine Sagnier is, as always, a pleasure for the eyes to behold, and she gives a very credible performance in one of the lead roles.  And for American viewers such as myself the film provides a glimpse into the culture of the French business world, although it is probably no more representative of reality than the film ""Wall Street"".  But at the very least you get to see what high-end office space in Paris' modern business district looks like.

Because the plot is so important to the overall impact of the movie, I won't mention any details about it.  Once the storyline unfolds completely, the plot makes complete sense and helps to illustrate the actual power relationships between the characters.  If Love Crime has some lessons to teach, it is that the most ruthless person can indeed rise to the top, but only for a while, and only to be replaced by someone even more ruthless.  The cycle will repeat, because that is the nature of the beast.  There is no way to know how applicable this lesson is to the real world of business as practiced in France, but it does make for a very interesting two hour movie.

Ludivine Sagnier gives a strong performance, as does her co-star, Kristin Scott Thomas.  Some of the supporting acting seems a bit stiff.  Kudos to the screenwriter Nathalie Carter, who came up with the delicious plot.  My only complaint about the plot is a very minor one: the headquarters for the multinational company was given as Washington, D.C., although the firm also has a New York office.  Multinational firms with U.S. headquarters are much more likely to be headquartered in New York and not the nation's capital, which is different than France (Paris), the U.K. (London) or Germany (Berlin).  But perhaps the headquarters was purposely placed in Washington D.C. to emphasize the importance of politics in this particular company.

See Love Crime if you like French cinema and might be interested in a movie for adults about office politics.",1351641600,,2284,4.815384615384615
4847822,4,B005NHZAOQ,"It's not really fair to say anything about the plot of this terrifically twisty little French thriller.  Just go into the story cold and it will be far more involving.  This is the one that -- at this writing -- Brian de Palma is rebooting in his own inimitable style.  My rooting loyalties were tested by the dark, amoral nature of the material, but I was definitely engaged.  Ludivine Sagnier (""Swimming Pool"") stars as a woman with a very strong sense of loyalty. Or is it betrayal?  Or revenge?  or justice?",1350000000,,511,4.56043956043956
4847823,3,B005NHZAOQ,"I was recently browsing the foreign movie section of my local library and came upon this movie. Being a Kristen Scott Thomas fan, I picked it up, not knowing anything about the plot as such. The fact that this was the last movie directed by damed French director Alain Corneau before he passed away, only added to the lure.

""Love Crime"" (2010 release from France; 106 min.; original title ""Crime d'Amour"") brings the story of Christine (played by Scott Thomas) as the ruthless local (i.e. Paris) CEO of a global marketing firm headquartered in Washington, DC. Christine is on a fast track towards a top position in the firm's New York office, as a result of some great marketing successes which in fact were developed by Christine's right hand woman, Isabelle (played by Ludivine Sagnier). Christine seemingly toys with Isabelle, t the point of sterring Isabelle into an affair with Philippe, Christine's boyfriend. When Isabelle decides to take full credit herself for the next successful marketing campaign, Christine is displeased and then some.

I won't say much more about the plot, because at that point it is clear that someone is going to suffer badly, but you don't know whether it will be Christine, Isabelle, or yet someone else. When that plot point is revealed (about an hour into this), the movie takes a completely unexpected (and unbelievable) turn of events. In some weird way, it actually kept my interest in the movie, as I kept thinking that there would be some further plot twist that would correct all of this, but then there isn't. Talk about bizarre! Apart from the significant leap of faith one has to take on more than one occasion to keep the plot of the movie credible, I also was non-plussed by most performances (several times the camera cuts into a new scene, where it felt like the actors had been told ""Three, two, one... and action!"" and the camera started rolling too soon), in particular Sagnier's performance which I thought was wooden and came across anything but natural. Given the many other choices of quality foreign movies out there, I would not recommend this movie.",1348185600,,2111,4.8448753462603875
4847824,4,B005NHZAOQ,"Alain Corneau wrote (with Nathalie Carter) and directed this little French thriller about the extremes to which people will go to maintain their goals - and the spatter of mess they leave behind on everyone who comes into contact with them.  Despite a fine cast of actors this story is one in which the audience simply doesn't care about anyone involved.  Bad things happen to bad people, and that concept is taken to extremes.

Christine (Kristin Scott Thomas) is a wealthy corporate executive in Paris who makes international deals through her brainy cunning. Her protg is the equally bright but less world-wise Isabelle (Ludivine Sagnier).  At times it appears that Christine wants to be in a relationship with Isabelle but at the same time Christine has a lover Philippe (Patrick Mille) who works for her and who incidentally is also sleeping with Isabelle. Games are played; Christine takes credit for Isabelle's ideas in a manipulative way to gain a position in the US.  Two tigers cannot in the same environment survive and Isabelle carefully plots the murder of Christine: we see Isabelle stabbing Christine to death. After the murder Isabelle, in an apparent drugged state, confesses to the murder and is sent to jail.  But the story is far from over as Isabelle's brilliant and now criminal mind knows how to manipulate this predicament as well as Christine would have had the tables been turned.

Despite the fact that both Kristin Scott Thomas and Ludivine Sagnier are both extraordinarily beautiful women and superb actors, neither is a character with whom we can empathize much less care.  Yes the plot is a brilliant Hitchcock type story and the film, though it drags in many places, is very well made.  But in the end we are left in an emotional vacuum. Where is the love of the title? Grady Harp, August 12",1346284800,,1823,4.854838709677419
4847825,4,B005NHZAOQ,"The film reminded me of the American classic, ""All About Eve""...same set up of the older woman star (Bette Davis) having to deal with a younger, meek, adoring upstart (Anne Baxter).  I didn't see ""The Devil Wears Prada"" but it sounds like that had a similar dynamic.
Here Kristin Scott Thomas plays the devilish one, in a performance that's not as broad as Bette Davis' but which outclasses her in subtleties.  (Is there anything Kristen Scott-Thomas can't do?  She is acts brilliantly, writes, directs, and speaks flawless French! Plus she looks good.)

It also had a shade of similarity to Hitchock films, who would have loved that pale blond, Ludivine Sagnier.  She is very good, too, as Isabelle,  the obsessive, insecure, but very smart young woman who has attached herself to Christine, the star in this French corporation.

I loved the sets--the furniture and costumes, all done in shades of gray.  This obviously tells us something about the heartlessness of this world.  The only time we see a character in a bright color, it's Isabelle, in a bright dress at Christine's party.  Blood?  Well, it's French so the symbolism is there but it's subtle.

The film is smart, I enjoyed the plot twists and turns, especially the final scene with the ambiguous cohort leaving our Isabelle lying flat on her bed.

This isn't a feel-good movie. It's a stylish French head trip.  As another reviewer wrote, it left him smiling, but ironically.",1341360000,,1439,4.892561983471074
4847826,5,B005NHZAOQ,This was great...Missed it at the movie house but; now I can watch it over and over...Great flip / flop ending,1335225600,,110,4.285714285714286
4847827,4,B005NHZAOQ,"This is not a movie to make sense. It had all ingredients to fail, But Corneau tuned it into a Hitchcockian fable. Enjoy the ride. Alain Corneau was a good filmmaker, He knew how to control the rhythm of a movie.",1331424000,,212,4.195121951219512
4847828,4,B005NHZAOQ,"There aren't a lot of thrills in this proclaimed thriller but there is a good murder mystery, this time with women in the lead.  Kristin Scott Thomas shows her fluency in French as the head of a Paris company that is a division of an American based conglomerate that works in agricultural supplements (as near as I could determine).  Her right hand ""man"" is also a woman.  Younger, but smart, energetic, determined and motivated, Isabelle (Ludivine Sagnier) is also a bit nave, shy and not quite up to the social aspects of corporate leadership.

Christine decides to mentor Isabelle to replace her as she has her eyes on a senior position in New York.  Christine (Scott Thomas) sends Isabelle on a trip to Egypt to make a presentation that Isabelle had developed.  She even sends her boy toy Philippe (Patrick Mille) along for moral support knowing that it would lead to more.  When Isabelle closes the deal, Christine takes all the credit in a conference call with her American bosses.  Isabelle is pissed and decides to pursue another assignment without Christine's knowledge.

This time Isabelle gets the credit in a presentation to the Americans.  They are excited about Isabelle's future, but now Christine is pissed, really pissed.  As Christine's promotion is put on hold she does everything she can to sabotage Isabelle's future including using Philippe with whom Isabelle has now fallen in love. This plot point never made much sense as we are never led to believe that union was about anything more than sex.

Aided by information provided by an assistant (Guillaume Marquet), Isabelle concocts an elaborate plot to get rid of Christine and frame her former lover.  This subterfuge is the heart of the movie.  Without giving away too much, the idea of everything isn't always what it seems is the crux of the mystery.  There are no good guys here and no one to cheer for.  But it is fun from the aspect of trying to figure out what Isabelle is up to.  That is the seductive charm of the film.",1329868800,5,2003,4.759420289855073
4847829,3,B005NHZAOQ,"As I always enjoy this actress'work, I decided to try this thriller.  Story line is: boss lady uses assistant's work to promote herself higher in the corporate world.  Once the other lady realizes she is being used, her attempt of pushing her own work behind her boss' back, is fought by nasty boss with humuliations and ridiculing her assistant to all management.  Now the plot thickens with a vengeful plan that is quite contrive but makes the movie interesting.  Moral is, eventhough it is lonely at the top, do not step on working ants as the Queen bee needs all her workers, at least that is what it seems.",1329004800,7,611,4.577981651376147
4847830,1,B005NHZAOQ,"I'm a big fan of Kristin Scott Thomas so I had high hopes for this movie, but they were misplaced. She must have a child to put through college or something, to be making lame movies like this. The plot is pathetic and the acting bad; a total waste of time.",1328659200,3,257,4.0588235294117645
4847831,1,B005NHZAOQ,"I tried streaming this thing earlier this evening.  I don't know why.  I guess it's because I bought into the whole Amazon Prime membership thing, and thought I'd take a chance on a foreign film.

You know, there's a lot to be said about French cinema, and how it hasn't lost its boring roots to toss in angsty characters in long takes with stories about egos, but all of it is negative.

I don't know what the heck it is about the French and their films.  I just don't get it.  A country with as much ""culture"" and history as France has, you would think would be up there creating great films filled with action and drama.  But none such is the case.  I'm not sure whether it's because they've lost nearly every war they've fought, or because the last Concorde when down in flames in their nation, or the fact that even though they were one of the first to make the net public but failed to progress their nation's internet any further during the 80s, it just seems like the French and their advancements always get stymied.  Case in point; French cinema.

So it is with this film.  Laden with some sort of plot regarding U.S. business interests, I just didn't get why one woman was trying to psychologically brow beat the other, and what all the head games were about.  I mean I half expected to see a lesbian affair develop out of this thing (no, it's not the reason I looked into this thing) because the film was just kind of that far out there.

I don't know, if you're into ego trips about invasions of privacy combined with lots of head games, then hey, check out this film.  Me, I had to wash out the bad taste with a Gregory Peck classic; ""Captain Horation Hornblower"".  If you must stream a film from Amazon, then do that one and not this French flick.",1328486400,3,1762,4.345565749235474
4847832,4,B005NHZAOQ,"I would agree with the four/five star reviews in that the film was a twisty, thought challenging love triangle suspense with a largely unexpected and well acted and scripted storyline. However, with the four star reviews as opposed to the five star reviews the main criticism was ""suspension of belief"" which for them was a plot that was a little too perfect and polished, especially with all the complicated counters thrown-in meant to lead the viewer off track. It was just a little too unlikely a perfect crime storm to be believable. Entertaining none the less.
The film's thoughtful plot intrigue reminded me of the very different supernatural film ""The Caller"" where, there too, you are continuously being led into asking questions about the most improbable sequence of events.",1327449600,3,783,5.077519379844961

This is an exquisitely filmed movie. The tale of a modern businesswoman wrapped up in jealousy and skullduggery office politics.

Kristin Scott Thomas, plays Christine, the boss, who steps on the coattails of her underlings. We are told at one point that the last young woman to work with Christine is now in a mental institution. Christine has taken on a new young woman, Isabelle, played by Ludivine Sagnier. Christine has latched on to her because she is brilliant, and because Christine thinks she is naive and easily intimidated. The place is Paris, and the countryside and city, is, of course, beautiful. These are high stakes, and, at one point, Christine sends Isabelle to Cairo to represent the company. She also sends her lover, Phillipe to Cairo. Whether Christine has planned that Phillipe will seduce Isabella is not clear, but that does indeed occur. And, now, Isabella is in love. This presents a conundrum, just at the point when Isabella discovers that Christine is taking all the credit for their recent business coup. Christine is quite open about how she operates with Isabella, and tells her this is how all businesses operate. In many ways, Christine is trying to seduce Isabella. And, then, a startingly event occurs that puts Isabella in the spotlight, and she has to account for her actions. How Isabella moves through this time is extraordinary. Isabella is quite clever and her intelligence and foresight is quite evident.

Alain Corneau, has given us a modern day mystery with many plots and turns. Once we think we understand, we are then turned upside down with a great splash. This film is well written and acted, the characters completley believable. Some of the events are so clever, that we wonder about the persons involved. Are they OK, or is this some fiendish one time event. The ending will not give you any answers, but will give you a sense of deja vous!

Highly Recommended.  prisrob 01-15-12
