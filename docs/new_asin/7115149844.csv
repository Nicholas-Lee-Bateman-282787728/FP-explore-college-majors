7899658,5,7115149844,"An epic film with grandeur, passion, brilliant acting, and consummate story telling - all come together like fine silk in ""Les Miserables"" (1995, in French; directed by Claude Lelouch; staring a superb cast led by Jean-Paul Belmondo as Henri Fortin and Jean Valjean). The sun rose again on Victor Hugo's classic novel; the screenwriter, Lelouch himself, has mastered the art of film adaptation meshed with stunning cinematography and scene frame-up, natural settings, scene and story transitions from one beautifully-distilled reality to another.

Time is not lost on either story; crescendo, decrescendo, and denouement are so richly-textured within the film - that these qualities somehow transcend the limitations of traditional cinema. In the end, Lelouch, Belmondo, and a cast of stellar performers (the silver lining in any movie) accomplish a superior feat of visual story telling. Quite remarkable how Lelouch kept the precise, complementary balance between Fortin, Valjean, and the other characters. All unities of plot, character, time, place, and theme were heavenly present.

Highly recommend this motion picture as a most serious classic within its genre. Remarkable attributes only add to its artistic finishing touches.",1331510400,,1234,5.664864864864865
