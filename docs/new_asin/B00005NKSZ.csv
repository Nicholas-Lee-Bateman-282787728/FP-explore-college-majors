1634535,1,B00005NKSZ,"This movie is an adulterated chick flick targeted at the 40+ crowd, in my estimation. The remarkably poor directing, exaggerated French accents and recycled storyline made me reach for my computer for something useful to do while I waited for the film to end.

Please don't make your man sit through this drivel. Get Sex and the City instead. It might not be set in ""la ville d'amour"", but the writing is much better.

(I was forced to watch this with the women in the family, and I'm typing this towards the end of the movie.)",1212192000,3,527,4.479166666666667
1634536,2,B00005NKSZ,"Bisset has a forced French accent as she portrays the Madame that Hamilton's frustrated
 journalist travels to visit to learn lessons of love when she learns she is losing her husband in this chat opera. No doubt the divorce papers must have read as grounds, ""terminal boredom.""  Jaqueline Bisset's previous features such as ""Wild Orchid"" where she always kept her clothes on while her costars all shed theirs were really more of an asset to her career than this film which could compete with ""My Fair Lady"" and win an Oscar for blandness.",1192752000,3,539,4.78494623655914
1634537,5,B00005NKSZ,"This movie is for any woman who has forgotten herself. It reminds you that you have to love yourself, before you can love someone else. After watching Jacqueline Bisset transform Linda Hamilton into a sexy, more confident woman, I felt that I could do anything I wanted to. It's my favorite feel good movie.

Please watch it, you won't be dissapointed.",1153526400,18,352,4.770491803278689
1634538,5,B00005NKSZ,"I simply love this film!  It's great for any woman in any circumstance, but if you've been feeling ""BLAH"", then this is the perfect film for you!  You'll be strutting high and feeling good about yourself - great girls' night out flick!!!!",1127692800,10,238,4.642857142857143
1634539,5,B00005NKSZ,"I always liked this movie and it inspires me to want to go to Paris someday. It was great to watch Linda Hamilton's character go from this repressed career woman to a woman with Joie de viev (I think I spelled that right). Very inspirational and enjoyable to watch and a bit of a lesson for many American woman who love trudging around in greasy old jogging clothes, shopping at Target and then come home asking, ""Why doesn't my husband make love to me anymore"" or ""Why is he leaving me"" or ""Why isn't he romantic"". Watch this film and you'll know why. It definitely takes a little something from both sides to get inspired.",1117411200,30,624,4.434782608695652
1634540,5,B00005NKSZ,"This is an ideal film to share with wine and hors d'oeuvres and someone fun, even if that delightful person is the one you see in the mirror.

This is one of my all-time fun movies. When I found out it was being released on DVD...I bought it immediately.

Jacqueline Bisset is so incredible in the role of Madame Simone, and seeing her read the other characters while giving them a wry look is a pleasure.

I do hope they do a part II.  I would love to see the cast brought together again for a second part. It deserves a second part. Only one film with Jacqueline Bisset interpreting Madame Simone is not enough.",1099872000,16,613,4.304347826086956
1634541,5,B00005NKSZ,"For every woman in search of herself and for the men in search of what women are looking for...  take heed of this movie.  Linda Hamilton is curious, funny, sweet and poignant.  Jacqueline Bisset is elegant, refined, sensual and sexy.  The most I've ever enjoyed both of them.
This is one of those rare films whose title may mislead its audience.  It is not about pagan sex, but rather a delightful comedy with a lesson in life for women, and for the men secure enough to listen and learn to their needs.
Watch this film to better yourself and to learn to appreciate the woman you love (if you are a man), or if you are a woman, watch this film to blossom into anything you want to be.  Either way, be ready to enjoy this film as it will make you laugh and make you see life in a different light.
This film should belong in everyone's DVD collection to remember to live life to the fullest and reassure one's self while learning the meaning of true love.
And yes, I too am a heterosexual man whom enjoyed this film very much.",1048377600,26,1025,4.284974093264249
1634542,5,B00005NKSZ,"I was surfing around for something to watch and I saw this and loved it. It was a very good story that caught my eye that I enjoyed and I had to get the DVD. I have wished someone could have reawakened my life of sorrow when I was going to my doctor and had to be at the hospital and lost my enjoyment of life for a number of years. I would advise you to get a good story like this in your movie collection in DVD, you will love it. By the way this is no sex or lesbian film like a number of you think. There is just a stong sense of self put back in someones life. By the way I am a man and even a man can enjoy a beautifull story like this. Get it in DVD.",1042329600,18,657,3.6013986013986012
1634543,5,B00005NKSZ,"This story is for women of any age and any marital status. Some women profess it stiffles all that women have worked for in the ""coming of age"" but I say this will empower you.  How? It reminds us all that we must love ourselves before others can love us.  The garter belts,etal, are just to get us thinking.  It's true--the clothes don't matter nor does our weight or anything else.  It all comes down to how you feel about you. If you exude the confidence, the rest will come to you.  I know, because it worked for me and I feel fabulous!",997142400,7,540,4.203883495145631

Viewers who are only familiar with Hamilton from her Terminator days may be surprised, but in a good way, I think, by her vulnerability in this made-for-TV move.  Bisset is so much fun to watch, and impossible not to envy, for her flawlessly elegant French style.  She brings Hamilton's character out of her shell so deftly, and with such compassion, that it makes me wish I could take a month in Paris and find my own ""facilitator"".
