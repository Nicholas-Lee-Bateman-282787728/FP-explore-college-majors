3843913,4,B002436WG2,"This is much better than average, with a real shock about a quarter way in. It is moody, well scripted and paced (edited) and well acted. One of the best of this ilk (gargoyles/dragons/flying monsters).",1283817600,18,202,4.8
3843914,3,B002436WG2,"This movie is okay,and worth watching but it could have been better. A little more action with the gargoyles in a little bit more of an intriguing way would have made this movie much better. The plot was good, but they could have giving this movie alot more and made it killer, if they would have used a better producer",1259625600,5,319,4.333333333333333

3843936,4,B002436WG2,I bought this with the sole expectation of seeing a cheesy monster movie and imagining Eric Balfour as an AU Professor Duke. I was not disappointed in the slightest. Except that there's no subtitles. At all. Minus one star for no subtitles.,1447632000,,240,4.738095238095238

3843938,4,B002436WG2,You just gotta love the sci/fi channel for bringing us some great scary B movies. Not only are they shown on the channel but better yet they get released on DVD and can usually be found at Wal-Mart.,1434067200,,198,4.2368421052631575

3843957,2,B002436WG2,"I did not like this movie. The special effects were cheesy and amateurish. The original movie ""Gargoyles"" was so much better. I believe it was made in the 60's with Wendell Corey.

Update: Ooops the actor was Cornel Wilde and the movie was made in 1972 - and the makeup was fantastic for that time.",1387756800,4,298,4.418181818181818
3843958,5,B002436WG2,I watched the series many years ago on VHS and i thought it was a  terrific series so when i was looking on Amazon there they were so i will try to buy the series again,1386460800,,168,3.6666666666666665
3843959,5,B002436WG2,"Saw a while ago, from about halfway through, and always wondered how it started.  Was so glad I found this.  I love Gargoyles, even though movies always depict them as evil creatures, not protectors.",1377734400,,199,4.823529411764706
3843960,4,B002436WG2,"Since this IS a ""Maneater"" SyFy-Channel movie, it has a few things you'd EXPECT:

=====> Blood.
=====> Guts.
=====> Reasonably priced
=====> At least ONE famous singer/TV/movie star appears.
=====> Under 91-minutes.

were BOTH enjoyable... TO ME!",1369612800,5,716,7.814814814814815
3843961,4,B002436WG2,"The first Gargoyles movie I saw was made int he 60s and starred Cornel Wilde and Jennifer Salt. The movie was intelligent, well acted, and had great special effects for the time. This movie looks at Gargoyles in a similar way, but the creatures are more violent, bloody, and nasty. The special effects are, of course, better but CGI helps with that. I enjoyed the movie the coupld of times I saw it on the SciFi channel. TV is so bad these days, I find myself preferring my DVD collection.",1364860800,7,489,4.444444444444445
3843962,5,B002436WG2,First type of this type of movie for me. I was surprised I liked it. Will but more of this type.,1363046400,2,96,3.619047619047619

3843964,4,B002436WG2,"Much like Carny, this movie tries to do something different than average Syfy-commissioned films. There's less creature attacks, lower body count (less characters period), and considerably more focus on mystery and such, even though the audience already knows what's going on.

Among the very few Syfy-commissioned films that tries to be spooky.

One question though: does France even have churches.",1355788800,,399,5.633333333333334
3843965,1,B002436WG2,"Don't believe the hype on here, this is just another b grade film that should have been made with a bigger budget, makes you crave for the 70's Gargoyles film that Stan Winston did the effects on, at least that was scary and well made.
So may I suggest you buy that film instead, don't waste your time or money on this one.",1317859200,3,323,4.142857142857143
8350282,4,B002436WG2,Special affects are great as the gargoyle from a Catholic Church hunts human prey in Paris. The acting is okay as is the plot line. The gargoyle steals the show.,1510099200,,161,4.4
8350283,3,B002436WG2,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2009 and directed by Bill Corcoran, ""Rise of the Gargoyles"" chronicles events in Paris when a brutal gargoyle is released from an inner chamber underneath an ancient church. A discredited Professor who specializes in mythic creatures (Eric Balfour) has a close call with the gargoyle and teams up with others to destroy it and its numerous eggs.

While this has similarities to 2004s Gargoyle and 1972s Gargoyles, its easily the least of the trio due to: (1.) dubious camera work that seems a notch below the typical Syfy movie; maybe they had crappy equipment, I don't know, (2.) a lousy third act and (3.) a CGI monster that looks more cartoony than the one in the 2004 flick. Furthermore, there are dull parts here & there; and they coulda done better on the female front.

Nevertheless, the European city and catacomb locations (or sets) are great and the ending of the first act features a shocking sequence that is extremely well-done where a woman is chased to the roof of her apartment building and (Im not going to give it away). Tanya Clarke really gave it her all in this scene as she truly looks terrified.

THE FILM RUNS 94 minutes and was shot in Bucharest, Romania, & Paris, France (the latter I presume was just used for establishing shots). WRITER: Andy Briggs. ADDITIONAL CAST: Ifan Huw Dafydd plays the skeptical inspector while Caroline Nron & Justin Salinger play tabloid reporter/hacks. Nick Mancuso appears as the over-the-top priest.

8350286,4,B002436WG2,"Bad cover art aside, this gargoyle movie lacks the blood and guts required to make it a really and truly scary creature feature.  But then it is the age of CGI and it was made for the Syfy Channel.  La Fureur des Gargouilles takes place in France of course, Paris to be exact.  Where its not surprising to find a church built on top of another church.  In this case there was a reason for that, they had something to hide.  But in horror movies nothing stays buried for long.  Two deconstruction workers break into a hidden crypt and start pocketing the valuable objects they find.  In the process they disturb something they shouldnt and must pay the consequences.  After that, bodies start piling up.  A professor of sorts (Eric Balfour as Jack) falls under suspicion by a dimwitted Inspector who figures him for a mass murderer.  In truth, hes just a bad writer, through no fault of his own; people around him tend to die.  Which makes him a bad risk for a friend.  But he will keep stumbling around, gaining cohorts and suspicious characters like a nutty priest with a high powered rifle and a spare body he keeps around.  Together they fight the gargoyle.

Its pretty obvious but still entertaining.  Its certainly not the best gargoyle movie ever made but it will do until a better one comes along.",1476403200,2,1304,4.560344827586207
