3913852,2,B002DY9KUM,Based on lots of hard to believe theories and speculations. No serious research. No good documentary material! Not worth watching!,1336003200,3,130,5.55
3913853,5,B002DY9KUM,"Amelia Earhart has been fascinating to historians and aviators for several generations now. The video explores the theories about her final flight and what might have happened to her. There are interviews with folks who beleive various theories and why they beleive what they do. It's interesting and unbiased. Finally, the video concludes that the simplest explanation is the most likely. AE simply lost her way, ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific. If you are looking for an interesting documentary on the final flight of Amelia Earhart, try this one.",1325030400,6,562,5.053763440860215

Then I must see that movie on Youtube! Sorry!

3913855,5,B002DY9KUM,"I thought this was the best Amelia documentary I have ever seen.  And for those that are wondering, it's better than the recent movie release.  I learned much about Amelia's last flight and the possiblities that could have occured.  This documentary explores the different scenarios and offers facts, interviews, and evidence to prove or disprove each theory.  Did the Japanese get her on Marshall Island?  If so, did she die there?  Has part of her shoe been found on yet another island?  Was she doing covert work for Roosevelt only to come back to the U.S. posing as a housewife in New Jersey?  Did a girl in Florida hear her pleas for help over the radio?

The truth is out there, but we may never find it.  Meantime, the debate continues and this documentary sums it up neatly.",1260144000,20,782,4.601449275362318
3913856,4,B002DY9KUM,"What happened to Earhart?  Did her plane fall into the ocean?  Was she a castaway who was never found and died on some tiny island?  Did the Japanese take her prisoner?  Did she change her name and live out her life in disguise?  This documentary juggles all those questions.  It rarely comes to conclusions because it wants the viewers to make their own.
This reminded me of Titanic.  You can't help but ask, ""What went wrong!?""  And of course, there is not just one explanation.  The reenactments are done well here; they're not cheesy.
Thinking of gender politics, the narrator does say she was the first woman to accomplish several aerial feats.  However, this said she had a male co-pilot on her plight.  I wonder why history has mostly erased him?  Most importantly, I recall every interviewee here being male.  Usually works on women have female interviewees.  I wonder if this mystery speaks to guys, rather than women, in some fashion.
The work also leaves me hanging in one way.  It ended by saying Earhart was tired of publicity and said this would be her last flight.  The work never discusses whether she was suicidal.
The work had English captions, but I wish it had had foreign language subtitles as well.",1255910400,15,1220,4.710900473933649
