1890458,3,B00009V2J7,"When it was first released, The Big Bounce was crucified by the critics and its reputation has never recovered. It's not a great movie by any means but it is interesting and entertaining. The central characters are not particularly likable and the general attitude of the movie is pretty cynical.

The DVD has quite good picture quality and the images are firm and stable. This DVD looks good even when watched via a projector on a large screen.",1298073600,3,445,4.705128205128205
1890459,3,B00009V2J7,"and looks like the technicolor print I saw in the army which stands up beautifully.  Ryan O'Neil can not deliver a line, but Leigh Taylor Young can and in spades. She is a knock out and for me the fun of the film.  The supporting cast is also a good one.  It is a shame who ever decided to cut up Elmore Leonard's book wasn't fired before the film was made.  They left out a main character which created lot of the tension and blackmail. Elmore Leonard's Kill Shot was short changed the same way; too bad!  The books are good. I give this 3 stars for Leigh Taylor Young;and it is far from the worst film you will see.",1291075200,,617,4.108333333333333

1890462,5,B00009V2J7,"About a decade after its Troy Donahue/Connie Stevens teen hit Parrish, Warner Bros. sought to duplicate that flick's formula with 1969's THE BIG BOUNCE, which offered a new pair of TV stars - ""PEYTON PLACE""'s Ryan O'Neal and Leigh Taylor-Young - in another sexy soaper set in a fertile farmland valley. The giggles begin right there: while Parrish's lovers toiled and tore each others' clothes off in tobacco fields, The Big Bounce examines the amorous ways of... cucumber pickers!

Hitchhiking along the road after losing his job, handsome cuke field hand Ryan O'Neal is picked up by his former boss, cuke king James Daly, who's out for a drive with his teenage mistress, Leigh Taylor-Young. ""The pickers call you 'El Pepino Grande,'"" O'Neal tells Daly, helpfully translating, ""The Great Cucumber."" This talk about cucumbers instantly arouses the nubile Taylor-Young, and her pepino fixation only increases when she learns that O'Neal is a troublemaker who's spent time in jail. But she's not the only one who appreciates the finer points of O'Neal's character. At a local bar, lonesome judge Van Heflin asks O'Neal to join him for drinks, and, batting his eyes hungrily, hints, ""What do I look like--a nice, clean old man?"" Ever on the make, O'Neal opts instead for saloon fixture Lee Grant, who lives with her young daughter at the seaside motel Heflin owns. Soon O'Neal is gainfully employed as the motel ""handyman."" Just how handy? Well, Heflin nicknames him ""Stud"" as he cooks breakfast for the two of them in his tres gay motel unit, replete with lavender wallpaper and puce curtains.

Left alone in Daly's beach house, Taylor-Young promptly invites O'Neal over, and before long confides that she was ""Miss Perky Pickle"" for Daly's cucumber empire. That difficult confession taken care of, she next reveals, ""When I was 14, I was selling it to all the boys on the block."" O'Neal wonders, ""How old are you?"" To which Taylor-Young replies, ""How old do I have to be?"" O'Neal is unfazed that this promising tart is underage, nor does he see anything seriously amiss about her asking, ""Did you ever kill anybody? Was it fun?"" No surprise, then, that he's all for it when she proposes they go on a neighborhood rampage together, during which they throw rocks through windows, break into a stranger's bedroom and make off with a bottle of booze. The evening culminates, as you'd hoped, in a deserted cemetery where they make love on a gravestone. And this, mind you, all happens on the first date.

Things are less pleasant when Taylor-Young's married sugar daddy, Daly, is in residence. Hoping to gain political favor with a visiting senator, Daly insists that his jailbait sweetie bed the horny politico. ""What if I don't play?"" Taylor-Young asks. ""If I had to replace you,"" sneers Daly, ""it might almost take a week."" Having done the deed, Taylor-Young searches down O'Neal to join her in revenge. But first things first: before getting bogged down in detailed planning, they strip, run bare-naked into the surf, swim out to Daly's yacht and have sex onboard. Then Taylor-Young suggests they steal 50 grand of Daly's payroll money. Not yet fully comprehending that Taylor-Young is nuts, O'Neal agrees. They celebrate their resolve by going for a spin in her car on the highway, during which two teenagers in a dune buggy get in her way, and she, laughing maniacally, runs the buggy off a cliff.

Come morning, O'Neal is finally having second thoughts about Taylor-Young's sanity. He broaches the subject of the previous night's crash victims by asking, ""What if I told you they're dead?"" Nothing if not consistent, she replies, ""They had it coming to them. Want a drink?"" To which O'Neal, suddenly in a mood for nit-picking, exclaims, ""It's 8:30 in the morning!"" Now on the moral high ground, Taylor-Young lets him have it: ""So--the big rooster turns out to be a little chicken. Is that it, chickie? Don't go square on me! Next thing you'll want to get married and make an honest woman out of me."" O'Neal replies, ""The thought strikes terror."" (This dialogue is all the richer when you consider that, in real life, O'Neal and Taylor-Young were married when they made this movie together.)

Back at the motel, O'Neal discovers that Lee Grant has committed suicide. He comforts her grieving daughter by explaining, ""Sometimes grown-ups get tired. They don't know what else to do anymore, they just want to go to sleep."" (This is especially true of grown-ups who are watching HE BIG BOUNCE.) The movie reaches its apex as Taylor-Young, now going officially psychotic, tears up the beach house and puts a fatal bullet in what she claims she thought was a prowler. O'Neal observes, accurately, that it was he who was obviously the intended target. ""Why would I want to shoot you?"" Taylor-Young bleats. ""Maybe because you thought it might be fun,"" hisses O'Neal, adding, ""Was it fun?"" In this cheeseball classic's unusual idea of a resolution, Taylor-Young shrugs her shoulders and replies, ""It was... all right.""

For unintended hilarity, THE BIG BOUNCE is much more than just ""all right.""",1187913600,6,5087,4.929988331388564
1890463,5,B00009V2J7,"For one thing the score by Mike Curb I felt horribly out of place in the film UNTIL the last shot (I won't mention it not to spoil the film) then I ""got it"". The music is the antithisis of what is happening on screen, and it's meant to be! It's a well made film and there is a hell of a lot more Leonard in this script uncensored than there was in recent Hollywood versions of his novels, Get Shorty for example.

PS The scene with Leigh Taylor Young standing nude in the graveyard is one of the most brilliant images I've ever seen in films.",1119657600,7,542,4.065420560747664
1890464,2,B00009V2J7,"Out of curiosity, I rented the 1969 film version of THE BIG BOUNCE (TBB) from Netflix, and it proved the underrated 2004 edition to be another example of a remake that's way better than the original! The two versions of TBB are fairly close in plotting, but the 2004 model captures source author Elmore Leonard's loopy, cynical sense of humor much better, skipping the original film's mawkish asides and heavy-handed attempts at poignancy and psychodrama. For instance, the self-pitying, self-destructive, male-afflicted single mom played by Lee Grant in 1969 is rebooted in the latest edition as a cheerfully coquettish tourist played by Anahit Minasyan, whose fate is much more upbeat than poor Grant's. Also, TBB Mark 2's Hawaiian setting and George S. Clinton's playful score combining rock and Hawaiian-style music appealed to me more than TBB Mark 1's been there-done-that Los Angeles locales (by the way, I seem to recall that Leonard's book is set in Detroit) and syrupy soft rock by Mike Curb, of all people. Next to The Mike Curb Congregation, The Brady Bunch's albums sound like the Rolling Stones' greatest hits! Even if it didn't sound hilariously dated to early 21st-century ears, Curb's score is still all wrong for a downbeat crime drama like the '69 model (not that the first film is completely humor-free; Van Heflin's eccentrically decorated home was one of the film's few bright spots). I almost got the feeling Curb originally composed the music for an entirely different kind of film, perhaps some perky, inspirational heart-warmer starring the folks from Up With People which never got off the ground, so someone decided to graft Curb's score onto TBB v. 1 instead of letting it go to waste. While both films have great casts overall (the original includes Heflin, James Daly, and Robert Webber in the roles played in 2004 by Morgan Freeman, Gary Sinise, and Charlie Sheen), in the starring role of ex-con Jack Ryan, Owen Wilson's wisecracking slackertude in TBB Mark 2 is much more engaging than Ryan O'Neal's personality in TBB Mark 1. While I've enjoyed O'Neal in comedies, particularly 1972's WHAT'S UP, DOC?, I've never liked him in dramas. To me, O'Neal has always come across as moist and mewling when he's supposed to be tender and sensitive, and surly and petulant when he's supposed to be tough and hard nosed, and his performance in TBB #1 is no exception. However, both films have terrific leading ladies playing thrill-seeking kept woman Nancy: the 2004 version marked Sara Foster's screen debut, while the original starred the lovely and beguiling Leigh Taylor-Young, then O'Neal's real-life wife and former co-star on TV's PEYTON PLACE. (Fun Fact: Leigh Taylor-Young was nominated for a Laurel Award for Best Female New Face for her performance in TBB.) The chemistry between O'Neal and LT-Y is one of the film's few saving graces; they sure seem to enjoy tearing their clothes off, and they look good doing it, too! :-) Alas, except for the occasional memorable line (for example, here's Heflin slyly commenting on O'Neal's phone chat with LT-Y: ""You look like the mouse that got swallowed by the pussy.""), Robert Dozier's screenplay can't seem to decide whether Nancy is a victim of callous men, a calculating femme fatale, or a plain old homicidal psycho. The critics who panned TBB Mark 2 obviously never had to suffer through Mark 1! If you've got your heart set on an at-home Elmore Leonard film festival, rent GET SHORTY, OUT OF SIGHT, even the overlong but still exceptional JACKIE BROWN, and include THE BIG BOUNCE -- but unless you lust after Ryan O'Neal and Leigh Taylor-Young in their prime, make sure you get your mitts on the superior 2004 version!",1117584000,2,3700,4.978998384491114
1890465,4,B00009V2J7,"The four stars I'm awarding to this product are not for the movie, which probably deserves only one star, but for the musical score, by Mike Curb.

The soundtrack is unfortunately not available here at Amazon.com, but can be found by doing websearches for online record sellers using the soundtrack title, _The Big Bounce_, as well as the main song titles, namely, _When Somebody Cares For You_ and/or _Nancy's Theme_, which are the main tunes heard throughout the movie.  This soundtrack seems to be fairly rare, although if one finds a copy it will be cheap, probably under $10.  That would be for a vinyl record.

I would disagree with the editorial review by Robert Horton, above, in which he states:

""the exceptionally maladroit musical score by Mike Curb (remember the soft-rock stylings of the Mike Curb Congregation?), whose soupy melodies undercut the tension at every turn...""

What might be ""exceptionally maladroit"" to Robert Horton is exceptionally melodious to me.  In fact, when one clicks on the hot-link for the Mike Curb Congregation in Horton's review, one sees that the resultant page for their Greatest Hits album has 7 reviews, all of them 5 stars.  Unfortunately, this Greatest Hits album does not include any of the melodies from _The Big Bounce_ soundtrack. (EDIT, 15Mar06: I will acknowledge that this particular soundtrack probably does not go very well with the dramatic genre of the movie, but of and by itself, I like the music.)

I am not trying to malign Mr. Horton, as he is entitled to his opinion, but just want to point out that musical tastes vary greatly among people and many people do in fact enjoy the ""soft-rock stylings"" of the 1960's, as described by Mr. Horton.

If you are one of those people who likes the instrumental, easy listening, Southern California sounds of the 1960's,  then I would suggest you consider looking for the soundtrack to this movie.

To summarize, the album title is _Original Motion Picture Soundtrack The Big Bounce_, published by Warner Bros.-Seven Arts Records, Inc.  The number on the album is WS1781.  Music composed and conducted by Mike Curb; Lyrics by Guy Hemrie; Orchestrations by Jerry Styner.  The front of the album cover is overall blue in color with a picture of the actress Leigh Taylor-Young in the foreground and Ryan O'Neal in the background.

Although the lyrics to the songs are indeed rather cheesy, this is mitigated by the fact that one side of the album has them sung by a chorus, while the reverse side is instrumental only.

As an aside, the main song, _When Somebody Cares For You_ was also recorded by Donny & Marie Osmond, on their 1975 album, _Make The World Go Away_.",1110067200,2,2669,4.843612334801762
1890466,3,B00009V2J7,"About 35 years ago, I sat alone in a movie theater and watched this movie.  That should have been my first clue that this movie was destined for nothing, but I was then, and still am, a devoted Ryan O'Neal fan, perhaps the longest-lasting fan he's ever had!  For years I searched for a video of this to complete my collection of all his movies.  I guess this movie was so bad it never went to video, but the happy ending just came when a remake of this movie prompted the release of the original on DVD.
Ryan O'Neal is cute as ever in this pre-Love Story tale based on the Elmore Leonard novel.  Leigh Taylor-Young is beautiful; I think I had forgotten just how beautiful.  Their chemistry is magnetic and, after all, she did become the second Mrs. Ryan O'Neal in real life.
The story centers around an ex-VietNam GI drifter Jack Ryan (O'Neal) who while working as a migratory farm laborer meets and is instantly attracted to the boss' secretary/lover Nancy Barker(Taylor-Young).  Their physical attraction is such that Jack is willing to do anything to please Nancy, even go along with her petty theft schemes.  When Nancy comes up with the idea to steal $50,000 (yes, when this movie was released that amount could have set the duo up for life) Jack is cautious and becomes aware of a sick streak in his girlfriend.
Lee Grant, Van Heflin, and other actors of note must cringe when they look at their performances is this one today.  It's stereotypical, trite, a bit silly, and totally laughable, especially the scene where Taylor-Young, in a fit of rage,  destroys her boss' beach house.  And it even shows quite a bit of skin by 1969 standards as Leigh Taylor-Young is shown nude in several scenes.
Would I recommend it?  Only if you love either of these two stars as much as I do.  Did I enjoy it?  Oh, totally.  For me personally, it was a five-star experience, but to keep my credibility it should only get one star on amazon.  Therefore, I have compromised and given it three.",1079222400,22,1983,4.546478873239437
7993014,4,B00009V2J7,"""THE BIG BOUNCE"" was something of a rarity. released by then Warner Bros./Seven Arts, this movie from 1969 was about a former Vietnam vet
 with a criminal record, played by Ryan O'Neal, just one year before starring in Paramount's ""LOVE STORY"" with Ali McGraw, who gets involved with an ex-con in a plan by a somewhat shady woman in a scheme to rob a payroll over $50,000 from a California produce farm.the co-stars of this movie are LeighTaylor-Young, Van Heflin, Robert Webber and Lee Grant. this movie was later remade in 2004 with Owen Wilson, but most folks prefer this original movie. but what's special about this Warner Bros. release is that it was produced by William Dozier and his Greenway Productions company, who was responsible for the iconic ABC-TV series, ""BATMAN"" and ""THE GREEN HORNET"" that were both made in association with Twentieth Century Fox Television in 1966. Dozier had formed Greenway Productions in 1964 after working with Screen Gems, and his first official TV series with Fox was ""THE LONER"" for CBS in 1965 that was created by Rod Serling, and the short-lived sitcom, ""THE TAMMY
GRIMES SHOW"" in Fall 1966. so ""THE BIG BOUNCE"" was certainly a departure for William Dozier after the cancelation of ""BATMAN"" by ABC in 1968, and two failed TV pilots of ""WONDER WOMAN"" and ""DICK TRACY"" in 1967. for serious fans of Ryan O'Neal, I'd recommend this movie, as well as for fans of Mr. Dozier, this is a rare item from the legendary executive producer and narrator of ""BATMAN"" that I'd also recommend!",1518912000,,1523,4.812977099236641

7993021,1,B00009V2J7,There wasn`t much about this movie that I did like.  O`neal was miscast as a pretty boy without the grit one would expect considering his police record and the tough guy persona his character was supposed to have. Not much  true chemistry between he and  Taylor-Young who lacked the necessary sex appeal to ignite his fire even with her nudity. The music really turned me off as it seemed more suitable to  a Gidget movie than a noir type film.  Why do they  stick  songs in the middle of a movie and  slow down the action? ( A real turn off for me). The story was good  and had it been in more capable hands could have been a great noir piece. Some of the lines were very effective and others seemed to fall flat with  O`Neal and Taylor-Young`s delivery.  I would like to see the story  done as a film noir the way they did in the 40`s.,1385510400,,837,4.19496855345912
