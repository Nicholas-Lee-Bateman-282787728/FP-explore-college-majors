When I was satisfied I purchased the said item.
I have played the Video & bar a slight inperfection with the quality, I am very pleased with the purchase & the same goes for the seller & Amazon.
As such, I will be happy to deal with Amazon again in the future.",1330387200,,416,4.024096385542169
381994,5,6301942671,"I have loved this movie ever since it first was released. It has been a Christmas ""must see"" at our house every year.  Now, the VHS is worn out.  When, if ever, will it be released on DVD?  It is such a heartwarming story, much different that a lot of the mindless newer Christmas movies out now.",1325376000,4,296,4.157894736842105
381995,5,6301942671,"A wonderful movie for all age groups, that even in Australia is relatively unknown. Bud Tingwell was a very well-known Australian actor, but I haven't even seen this film on TV since the 1990s. Ned, the star of the film, is the cutest little boy, and his belief that Father Christmas (Santa for all you Americans!) will come, no matter what else happens, is so wonderfully innocent. It takes us all back to our own childhoods. When will they bring this movie out on DVD so we can continue to enjoy it in the future?? If you still have a VHS player, buy this tape.",1305158400,,563,4.371428571428571
381996,5,6301942671,Good film on old time values.  Great to use as a teaching tool for the way thing were in the earily 1900s.  Found myself drawn back to my life on the farm and water issues.,1293580800,,172,3.8857142857142857
381997,5,6301942671,My siblings and I would watch this video when we were much younger ;-) and quote it all of the time!! I was so happy to find a copy of it and in GREAT condition. This item was as advertised and delivered timely!,1260230400,,211,3.9302325581395348
381998,5,6301942671,"As a family we've watched this film every Christmas for years.  It has so many elements 1) an unusual setting, Christmas in Australia, 2) a touching story on several levels about family, loss, kindness, honesty, love, hardship and the belief of a little boy in Santa, 3) a real sense of humor, 4) the love of a family struggling to make it 5) the pain of loss from of a wife and mother passed on and the healing that's needed for the father and son left behind.

This movie has a charm that is not found elsewhere.  Just the idea of a Santa in Australia during their summer season and that man being on the run, with redemption possible for him as he works to fulfill the dreams of an innocent and precocious child.

Most folks we know have never heard of this movie.  We can't recommend it enough.  We cherish our tradition of watching it each season.  It reminds us in many different and beautiful ways about the spirit of Christmas even in summer in December in Australia.  chrisbct@hotmail.com",1166572800,7,997,4.5
381999,5,6301942671,"American actress Dee Wallace Stone (E.T; ""10"") and Australian actor John Waters (Breaker Morant, All The Rivers Run) star in this brilliant Australian motion picture directed by George Miller, best known for his critcally acclaimed file - The Man From Snowy River. Shot entirely on location in the breathtaking wilds of southeastern Australia, this impressive feature captures the exciting adventures and personal conflicts a rugged group of settlers endure in the remote bush country during the 1890's. Visions of taming the frontier quickly fade one summer's drought until a series of miraculous events rekindles the pioneers hopes. Running time: 106 minutes. Color",1102636800,5,667,5.549019607843137
382000,5,6301942671,"I love to watch this movie every Christmas!  The story concerns a family living in Australia in the 1800's.  Australia is very hot at Christmas, because their summer is then, so the holiday gets celebrated very differently.  During the story, a drought is on and everything is dying. The family is very poor and can't afford to buy gifts but their little boy is sure that ""Father Christmas"" whom he thinks he's met in person, will get him a gift if he's good.  When a scoundrel pretending to be Father Christmas, and the local rich man get involved, it becomes a Christmas none of them ever forget.  The movie has one scene that would make it worth watching anyway, even if it weren't a good movie:  the scene where they try to have a traditional English Christmas (complete with Yule log in 100 + weather) and the roasted pig takes a header across the room.  You'll love it!",1056585600,17,875,4.5
382001,5,6301942671,"What a wonderful, overlooked holiday film. An amazing cast of characters that reveals the hard life in turn of the century Australia. One of our families annual traditions is to watch this movie together.",1038268800,7,204,5.029411764705882
382002,5,6301942671,"A different look at Christmas in a different culture with fine acting, crisp dialogue, good humor and the underlying true meaning of Christmas coming through without overbearing moral overtones.  A wonderful,  entertaining alternative to typical Hollywood gushy Christmas shows  produced with half-wits in mind.",945043200,10,311,6.0227272727272725

7817285,5,6301942671,"I loved this movie and have kept it in my heart for years. I had looked for it each year to see if it was playing again on tv or if it was being sold in the stores but with no luck. This year, really wanting my daughter to be able to see it, I tried again and googled to find any Christmas movies set in Australia. I had no idea what the title was. But, yay, finally I found it! On VHS? Boo :( I really, really wish that someone would put this one onto DVD or just digitize it for Netflix or something. It's such a good movie, it really deserves to be watched. I would certainly buy it!",1481414400,,586,3.8512396694214877
7817286,5,6301942671,"This was a gift for family. Their old copy, which they had recorded off TV had failed them. They were thrilled to get it. The seller went out of his way to transfer it to a DVD also at no extra cost. Thumbs up here.",1481241600,,215,3.8
7817287,5,6301942671,"I really liked this movie.  It has sincere and good acting.  The story illustrates, among other things, how pioneers from the northern hemisphere learned to celebrate Christmas in a totally different season ""down under.""  The attempt of the rich man to burn a yule log during a long hot drought was painfully amusing.  It ends on a note of hope and forgiveness, transformation and reconciliation, but not in quite the clichd way some films do it.  Maybe I'm biased, but I rank it as one of better Christmas films made and very much wish it would be released on DVD and/or blu ray. Don't care if they release it as Miracle Down Under or as The Christmas Visitor (the name it played under on U.S. TV/",1447027200,,698,4.507936507936508

7817291,5,6301942671,"A wonderful heartwarming story. Very touching how a little boy can change the heart of one hard-hearted man who has forgotten what friends and family really mean, that money is not everything, and how a community can come together to help one another..
