7126875,4,B00W8W38G6,"The film displayed touching, humorous, sentimental performances, particularly by Max Adler and Danny Mooney.
The Director, Matt Ladensack kept the film moving forward frame by frame.
The film contained humor, sorrow, and hit on today's trending topics and national discussions concerning religion, the LGBT community, and family values.
I recommend this film.",1439856000,,359,5.923076923076923
7126876,4,B00W8W38G6,"Just finished watching ""Saugatuck Cures"" released by Breaking Glass Pictures.
Beautifully filmed ""Saugatuck Cures"" is a road-trip dramedy that at times mirrors the Hope & Crosby road trip pictures.
Maggie; stoically played by Judith Chapman, the widowed owner of a bed and breakfast in Saugatuck, is calmly and sadly facing death as the cancer that threatened her life has returned with a vengeance.  An experimental treatment does exist in Chicago, but it will cost $75,000 and is not covered by Obamacare. [Imagine that!]
Maggie is trying to have one last happy Thanksgiving with her family and friends which include her openly gay ex-jock and volunteer fire-fighter son Drew and her religious zealot of a daughter Penelope.  When a fight erupts between Drew and Penelope - who just happened to have been engaged to Drew's best and drunken straight best friend Brett - the truth is revealed about Maggie's condition and Drew falls into despair because he doesn't have the money to get his mother the treatment she needs to save her life.[Wasn't Obamacare supposed to take care of this?  No wait, Maggie falls under the death panel clause of the law!]
So at a nearby bar where Drew and Brett are having a few drinks later, Brett hits upon a scheme to raise the money needed for Maggie's cancer treatment.  They will pose as reformed gays, saved by religion to bilk money out of gullible Christians by promoting themselves as the cure to the gay blues in the ""Hetero-Mobile.""
Now there is a bit of stereotyping in this movie of Christians and yes, even Jews, where our would be gay-reformers are bilked out of $200 at a synagogue; but its mostly inoffensive and a bit hysterical.
So will Drew and Brett bilk homophobic religious zealots out of the $75,000 Maggie needs for her cancer treatment in Chicago; or will a gay minister in a Saugatuck church attends lead the behind the scenes community effort to save Maggie.  Will Penelope and Brett ever get back together?  Spoiler Alert - And if that's really the Village People, they've aged badly!
""Saugatuck Cures"" isn't a great movie; but it has enough bright moments of comedy and real life moments to make it a sweet and touching movie about the determination of hope.
Recommended!

7126878,2,B00W8W38G6,"Wow. Where to start. I wanted to like this film. I wanted to love this film. As an avid watcher of Glee, I became a huge fan of Max Adler. Max brought such range and complexity to the role of David Karofsky, closeted jock bully turned out and proud gay man. But as great of an actor Max Adler is, he could not save this dreadful, dreadful movie. In fact, the only reason I am giving this film two stars instead of one is because I want so badly for Max Adler to succeed. I want him to do well.

There are a handful of humorous moments in Saugatuck but ultimately the film relies heavy on cheap gags, schmaltzy dialogue and cliched plots. What was the most problematic role of this movie was the role of a sassy, black transgender woman/drag queen - honestly the movie is next clear as to who she is- character named Lacresha/Laquisha/Lakeisha. I swear they pronounced her name they referred to her. Come to think of it, this movie is chocked full of stereotypes, everything from the Fundamentalist, homophobic sister to the lovable but annoying screw-up best friend.

If you are looking for something to laugh at instead of laugh with, I suggest you check this film out. But you have been warned. This movie is ... not good and not even a pants-less Max Adler could save it.",1437955200,,1274,4.44017094017094
7126879,5,B00W8W38G6,"I loved this movie.  All you need is a sense of humor and a box of Kleenex.  The scenery is magnificent with all the Autumn leaves on the trees. So glad I purchased, because I plan on watching over and over again.  You will laugh and you will cry.  Enjoy the rollercoaster ride.",1436313600,4,278,4.188679245283019

8712556,1,B00W8W38G6,"Heart's in the right place, but that's about it.  As a part-time Saugatuck resident, I really looked forward to seeing the film and all of the recognizable parts of this lovely, bucolic, gay-friendly town.  Unfortunately, the scenery is the only thing worth recommending.  This mixed bag of so-so acting, poor editing, lots of dialogue that seemed made up on the spot, and cringe-inducing clich after clich was just too much.  The relationships between the characters are so underdeveloped that it was hard to believe or care about any of them.  How do films like this get made?  It could have been good.  Save your money and time and come see what really makes this little town so special.",1451520000,,690,4.796610169491525

8712558,2,B00W8W38G6,"I'm really surprised by all of the glowing reviews for this film.  For the most part, I thought it was pretty lame: ridiculous plot, poor acting, and WAY too many clichs (the whole Village People thing was downright bizarre).  On the other hand, the confessional scene was poignant, and the ending was cheerful (if not just a bit too formulaic).  I think the best I could give this film would be a C-minus...",1446508800,,408,4.561643835616438

8712560,4,B00W8W38G6,"Predictable, Sincere, and Cute.

This is a very modest film, but it won me over. It's not about the plot, or great acting, and the script is none too deep, but the editing and direction make the most of this material. It's a fun film, well worth a rental. The ending is lovely, also, easily the best part of the film.",1440806400,,317,4.19672131147541
