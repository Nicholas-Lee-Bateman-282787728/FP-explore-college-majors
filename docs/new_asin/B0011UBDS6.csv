3068330,5,B0011UBDS6,"A little Animal House, some Van Wilder, a dash of American Pie, and a pinch of Gilmore Girls-esque drama, Greek is the kind of premise that could have easily gone cheesy and overdone. Fortunately, it doesn't; whether it's depictions of life in the Greek system are accurate or exaggerated, it manages to find a happy medium between alcohol-drenched party scenes and actual character-driven drama.
It's the characters, while mildly stereotypical, that really make the show; anyone who was awkward as a college freshman, whether they were in the Greek system or not, will identify with Rusty, the dorky physics major who longs to be in a fraternity; his older sister Casey may at first glance play the perfect blonde sorority princess, but she has plenty of flaws and problems to work through. Her current high-society boyfriend Evan, while definitely arrogant and a little flaky, also seems to have a sensitive side; but it's Casey's ex, ringleader of the Animal House-esque Kappa Taus, aptly-nicknamed Cappie, who steals the show. A funny, fast-talking, goofball with a heart of gold (which gets broken entirely too often), he's the kind of character you can't help but love (unless your Evan Chambers, anyway). The supporting characters, too, are surprisingly well-developed (Dale, Rusty's Bible-thumping, physics nerd roommate is hysterical, and Casey's archenemy Rebecca is the girl everyone loves to hate), and the show even tackles such issues as gays in the Greek system. However, the main theme of the show seems to be the importance of brotherhood, family and friendship. All in all, a great show, definitely worth a look.",1206662400,22,1630,5.178030303030303
3068331,5,B0011UBDS6,"Greek is by far the best show on television right now.  The ABC Family original comedy is probably more suited for people in their teens and 20's, but my mom also loves the show.  It's smart, funny and sometimes painfully true.  As somebody who experienced Greek life, this show really brings back a lot of memories.  The DVD is a bit skimpy on extras, but the episodes themselves are enough to keep me buying Greek on DVD for future seasons.",1206403200,11,442,4.4875

I've never been happier to be proven wrong about a show. The story of Rusty and Casey Cartwright's unique experiences in their college Greek system made me wish I had rushed myself.

3068387,5,B0011UBDS6,"The show starts off with Rusty Cartwright, a nerdy poly-sci major, who wants a full college experience. His main desire is to find himself a place in the Greek system, and 'Rush' a Fraternity. His sister being on the other end of the spectrum, she is unsure of her major, but is likely going to be the next president of her Sorority ZBZ. Rusty looking to his big sister for help gets torn between joining two Fraternities, Kappa Tau, and Omega Chi.

This chapter includes the 1st 10 episodes which equals a semester of collage leading to winter break. The next chapter starts with all the students returning from there visits home. While it is technically just volume one of season one, it is a great breaking point in a dvd-tv-series for once.

This was one of the best shows I had ever seen, and it was hidden on ABC Family. Unless you like to watch 'pregnant teen american' or 'who's pretending to be our dead friend', I'd say its the best thing on that channel. Tho I do enjoy some PLL. ;p",1391299200,,993,4.420765027322404

3068415,5,B0011UBDS6,"Television about college aged kids nowadays, frankly, sucks. It sucks bad, mostly because it's reality television. When Greek was on, it was a breath of fresh air. Yes, there were parties, and drinking, and sex, but there was also real human emotion, and problems that everybody from every walk of life could relate to. Every time it was on, no matter what responsibilities I had, you better believe I was tossing my homework across the room and cranking the volume up.

Our main cast of characters is:

Rusty Cartwright (Jacob Zachar) - A flat out nerdy, inexperienced slip of a kid who is always living in his sister's shadow. Rusty is determined to make a name for himself at Cyprus Rhodes University by going from geek to Greek and pledging Kappa Tau, a rowdy fraternity filled with goof offs and partiers.

Casey Cartwright (Spencer Grammar) - Rusty's ""perfect"" sister. Casey is an active and proud member of Zeta Beta Zeta. She takes the Greek lifestyle very seriously, but also feels pressured because of Rusty's academics to be more than just a pretty sorority sister.

Cappie (Scott Michael Foster) - President of Kappa Tau Gamma, as well as Casey's ex-boyfriend. Cappie actually takes his role as leader of the KTs very seriously, handling the job while living his life with a devil may care attitude. He takes Rusty under his wing an introduces him to college life.

Evan Chambers (Jake McDorman) - President of Omega Chi Delta, and Casey's current boyfriend. He is a well-to-do rich kid, the well groomed heir to the Chambers empire who may not be as content with his life as he seems. Together he and Casey are the campus ""It Couple"", but must recover from a huge blow to their relationship.

Calvin Owens (Paul James) - An Omega Chi prodigy who knows his way around a sports stadium. Calvin and Rusty bond and immediately become good friends. He is struggling with his identity of being a masculine gay man in a frat house full of on-edge straight guys, and is still (mostly) in the closet.

Ashleigh Howard (Amber Stevens) - Casey's sorority gal pal and another active member of ZBZ. Ashleigh enjoys the partying lifestyle of the Greek system and happily spends her time planning social events and attending them. She makes some less than perfect choices about how to live her life, however, and learns things the tough way. She and Calvin bond.

Rebecca Logan (Dilshad Vadsaria) - A young ZBZ pledge and slightly bratty politician's daughter. Rebecca has some less than pure intentions behind a lot of her actions, but underneath it all is just a girl who wants love from her constantly absent and less than capable father. Rebecca and Evan become a little too close for Casey's comfort, and she eventually begins to bond with Cappie.

Dale Kettlewell (Clark Duke) - An uptight conservative Southern Baptist who proudly displays a Confederate flag above his bed and goes to sleep to the sound of gospel music. Dale and Rusty become good friends, despite Dale's staunch anti-Greek activism, although he spends a good amount of time warning Rusty of the dangers of pledging himself to a life full of such sin. He loosens up a bit as Rusty and Calvin widen his world-view.

There are plenty of loveable background characters, such as the conniving Frannie (president of ZBZ) and goofy KT member Beaver (go ahead and ask him how he got his name, go on.) A lot of issues that college students actually tackle are addressed here, such as the stress of the Greek system, sexual pressures and expectations, and how to balance a school life and a personal life. There's plenty of funny times amongst the seriousness, so one never has to worry about whether or not they're going to laugh.

Now, be warned. For those who are just getting into this series, this is only the first ""chapter"". While it is a normal television season (ten episodes) the ""full"" season is composed of chapters one and two. This DVD includes the episodes...

3068418,3,B0011UBDS6,"There are basically (2) reasons I like this show; college newbie RUSTY CARTWRIGHT is a very dorky looking innocent and enthusiastic nerd/geek and his many endearing qualities grew on me quickly, and the ""Animal House"" like fraternity KTT - because they're such an odd mix of weird characters but they come up with some fun activities.

Outside of that you get to enjoy (or in my case ""NOT"") the never ending back-stabbing, conniving, bitchiness of the characters of the ZBZ sorority sisters.  And while of course there are people like this in real life, I'm sick to death of it on TV.  People growing up thinking this is how they should be, how they need to be to make it.  And, if it was ""real life"" those ""sisters"" would've gotten physical - and would've been kicked out of the house.  I can't see anyone living in that caustic of an environment for long.  Other characters are VERY sterotypical...

Amazingly, this takes place in Ohio - but the weather in the show seems to be more like California or Florida. They wear shorts and sleeveless tops etc. pretty much the whole school year long - occasionally a hat or a sweat-jacket (hoodie) is worn.  And except for a VERY FEW episodes, nobody seems to have class or study. Where all the money comes from for most of the things these college kids do is also a wonder. Are they ALL from rich parents?  They seem to have endless financial resources - none of them having to work and they throw elaborate parties and activities with all kinds of expensive catering and decorating and costumes etc.

Overall, I didn't think it was all that realistic or interesting of a show but watching young Rusty (aka ""spitter"") grow/mature, and the antics of the KTT house was entertaining.",1346803200,,1725,4.644736842105263

I still can't figure out if we're supposed to like Casey or not. And the sorority girls get really annoying. I guess there is a certain audience for this, which is not me. If you are a girl that's into clothes, money/status, makeup, and being boy crazy, this show is for you. If you're a guy that's into girls and parties, and don't really think about much else, this show is probably for you as well.",1330214400,3,639,4.378151260504202

3068435,4,B0011UBDS6,I love this DVD set! One that all Greek lovers should own! Definitely a neat TV series for current college students. My only complaint is you don't get the whole first season.

3068438,5,B0011UBDS6,This show was an absolutely pleasant surprise. I was expecting it to be idiotic but it wasn't. Rather the stories were great and having been in a fraternity not without a great deal of realism. A nice mix of crazy fun and eye candy with good storytelling. I recognize many of the characters in there as being of very similar personality types who join fraternities. Very very good - you will not be disappointed.,1267228800,,412,4.581081081081081
3068439,5,B0011UBDS6,"I don't remember how I came across Greek but I started watching it online about a year ago. I started off with one episode and couldn't seem to stop. Soon enough I was finished the entire Chapter and craving more.

The show follows Casey, Cappie, and Evan (who are all in their third year) and the trials and tribulations that they face in their respected sororities and fraternities.

What gets interesting is when Rusty (Casey's awkward and nerdy brother) shows up. He adds a different perspective to the show. He's out of his element yet he pledges anyways in order to get the full ""college experience"". I like Rusty so much because his character allows for great diversity (among the already diverse cast) as he shakes things up. The characters are likable and they develop wonderfully as the show goes on. The plot always keeps you wanting more. I can't even describe how lovely the show is.

I would also like to point out that this show is age friendly! I loved it so much that after I purchased it I got my mom, dad, and grandma into it (plus a few friends my own age).

Definitely looking forward to the next season and I recommend this show to anyone and everyone!",1250467200,2,1174,4.523584905660377
3068440,5,B0011UBDS6,"Like many reviewers I was shocked upon my first visit to Cyprus Rhodes University.  Having been almost attacked with promos all spring in 2007 the series just seemed over the top, stereotypical and bland so I passed when the series initially aired.  But then a friend insisted that I watched the series.  And to my pleasant surprise I discovered a wonderfully entertaining and funny story of a group of kids just trying to survive the college experience.

 In the pilot many of the characters are presented as 2-Dimensional stereotypes.  You have the preppy boys, the hot/only-mildly-smart girl, the religious Texan, the nerd with the insane GPA and on and on.  But not thirty minutes into the series the writers start to peal back the layers of the characters showing the audience their true aspirations, fears, and heartache.  Within several episodes the characters have evolved from archetypes to people you very well could have gone to college with.  The people who you ate with in the dinning hall, the people you crammed with before finals, your friends.

 But I don't want to give the wrong impression of the show.  First and foremost this is a quirky soap-comedy.  Straying away from territory put forth by the perma-depressing ""Felicity"" or the too literal realm of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Dawson's Creek,"" the college presented in ""Greek"" is a understandably a fantasy college.  Money is never an issue, while the characters are seen in class they seem to have as much free time in the world (especially since not one of them have a part-time job).  But it is in the characters that you feel hooked into the series.

 Put into a satirical almost fantasy-like world of the ultimate view of college (complete with 300 sq ft dorm rooms), these characters are the heart of the show.  I know that for myself while I was entertained immensely from the amusing weekly shenanigans (which range from a depression-era speak-easy party, to a quest to make it rain beer, and having to run from an escaped mental patient) but it was the dynamic between the characters, the relationships, that brought me back episode after episode.

 ""Greek"" is not a perfect show. It is cheaply made and obviously first-and-foremost aimed at those not yet in college.  But for those who enjoy great character structure there is enough poignancy in this return trip to college to definitely make up for the price of admission.  Highly Recommended.

  The Special Features on the DVD include: a selection of deleted scenes, a sneak peak at ""Chapter 2"" (which is already available on DVD with `Chapter 3' as well), the featurette ""Greek: The Initiation"" (which is a behind-the-scenes look at the conception of the show, casting, and the initial several days of filming, and three commentaries (Creator Shawn Piller and cast talk over the ""Pilot,"" while members of the cast discuss ""Friday Night Frights"" and ""Separation Anxiety.""",1249689600,2,2915,4.948559670781893

3068442,5,B0011UBDS6,"Greek is unique in that it begins by setting up a series of stereotypical characters--the nerdy freshman, the southern fundamentalist, the sorority girl, the jerk boyfriend, the closeted gay guy--and then, over the course of the season's run, destroys each and every stereotype.

By gradually adding depth to the characters and then letting them run loose in the college setting, the show's creators have managed to create believable and interesting situations that balance drama and comedy. The snappy writing is supported by strong ensemble acting. Ultimately, the show succeeds at what it sets out to do: to create a group of interesting characters that interact with one another in interesting ways.

The series is an interesting peak into college life in general and Greek life especially -- both the good and the bad, but mostly the good.  The reason why I couldn't give this DVD set more than three stars is because of the profanity (mild as it is), the promiscuity, and the binge drinking.  Oh, and then there's the sorority president prostituting one of her sisters to keep one of the popular guys in the most popular fraternity attached to their sorority.  Then that same sister dresses her sorority up like tramps to keep another fraternity from winning a floor hockey game.  This is not something that belongs on a so-called family network.

3068460,5,B0011UBDS6,"I've only recently gotten into the show ""Greek"", but I'm so glad I found it. When I first saw promos for the show I dismissed it, because, um...it's on ABC Family. I thought it would be a lame - heavy on the PG side of things - comedy series that wouldn't even be close to the college life I've experienced. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised when I finally caught an episode a few weeks ago, and then promptly ordered the DVD set.

""Greek"" is such a witty, fun show. It doesn't sidestep the racier elements of college, but it also doesn't make it it's primary focus either. The characters are awesome (I heart Dale. Outside of infomercials, you don't see many Christian rock loving characters on TV) and the relationships are complex, realistic, and inspire many a chant of 'OMG. Just get back together already!'. Cappie and Casey, I'm looking at you. And I look menacing.

As for the DVD set, there isn't a whole lot on there.

This show is quite refreshing.  In the midst of all of the shows aimed at teens which aim to show teens acting beyond their years, this one is much more young and fresh.  Sex is not at the helm of this show, and only a couple times has it been a centric theme.  It shows a group of young adults enjoying their lives, freedom, friendship and college.

Of course we have all the cliches of the genre (betrayal,love,friends,ect...)but in a light and not too soapy way. It's like American Pie became a TV show without the horny geeks (we still have some though,but they're not the main characters).Plus,there's a big change compared to the shows of my youth,the gay guy (who isn't a crazy queen or a depressed kid who feel cursed) is as important and developped as the rest of the characters of the show,and it's a nice and modern way to put it.

3302827,5,B0011UBDS6,"A little Animal House, some Van Wilder, a dash of American Pie, and a pinch of Gilmore Girls-esque drama, Greek is the kind of premise that could have easily gone cheesy and overdone. Fortunately, it doesn't; whether it's depictions of life in the Greek system are accurate or exaggerated, it manages to find a happy medium between alcohol-drenched party scenes and actual character-driven drama.
It's the characters, while mildly stereotypical, that really make the show; anyone who was awkward as a college freshman, whether they were in the Greek system or not, will identify with Rusty, the dorky physics major who longs to be in a fraternity; his older sister Casey may at first glance play the perfect blonde sorority princess, but she has plenty of flaws and problems to work through. Her current high-society boyfriend Evan, while definitely arrogant and a little flaky, also seems to have a sensitive side; but it's Casey's ex, ringleader of the Animal House-esque Kappa Taus, aptly-nicknamed Cappie, who steals the show. A funny, fast-talking, goofball with a heart of gold (which gets broken entirely too often), he's the kind of character you can't help but love (unless your Evan Chambers, anyway). The supporting characters, too, are surprisingly well-developed (Dale, Rusty's Bible-thumping, physics nerd roommate is hysterical, and Casey's archenemy Rebecca is the girl everyone loves to hate), and the show even tackles such issues as gays in the Greek system. However, the main theme of the show seems to be the importance of brotherhood, family and friendship. All in all, a great show, definitely worth a look.",1206662400,22,1630,5.178030303030303

Rusty looking to his big sister for help gets torn between joining two Fraternities, Kappa Tau, and Omega Chi.

3302912,5,B0011UBDS6,"Television about college aged kids nowadays, frankly, sucks. It sucks bad, mostly because it's reality television. When Greek was on, it was a breath of fresh air. Yes, there were parties, and drinking, and sex, but there was also real human emotion, and problems that everybody from every walk of life could relate to. Every time it was on, no matter what responsibilities I had, you better believe I was tossing my homework across the room and cranking the volume up.

Our main cast of characters is:

Rusty Cartwright (Jacob Zachar) - A flat out nerdy, inexperienced slip of a kid who is always living in his sister's shadow. Rusty is determined to make a name for himself at Cyprus Rhodes University by going from geek to Greek and pledging Kappa Tau, a rowdy fraternity filled with goof offs and partiers.

Casey Cartwright (Spencer Grammar) - Rusty's ""perfect"" sister. Casey is an active and proud member of Zeta Beta Zeta. She takes the Greek lifestyle very seriously, but also feels pressured because of Rusty's academics to be more than just a pretty sorority sister.

Cappie (Scott Michael Foster) - President of Kappa Tau Gamma, as well as Casey's ex-boyfriend. Cappie actually takes his role as leader of the KTs very seriously, handling the job while living his life with a devil may care attitude. He takes Rusty under his wing an introduces him to college life.

Evan Chambers (Jake McDorman) - President of Omega Chi Delta, and Casey's current boyfriend. He is a well-to-do rich kid, the well groomed heir to the Chambers empire who may not be as content with his life as he seems. Together he and Casey are the campus ""It Couple"", but must recover from a huge blow to their relationship.

Calvin Owens (Paul James) - An Omega Chi prodigy who knows his way around a sports stadium. Calvin and Rusty bond and immediately become good friends. He is struggling with his identity of being a masculine gay man in a frat house full of on-edge straight guys, and is still (mostly) in the closet.

Ashleigh Howard (Amber Stevens) - Casey's sorority gal pal and another active member of ZBZ. Ashleigh enjoys the partying lifestyle of the Greek system and happily spends her time planning social events and attending them. She makes some less than perfect choices about how to live her life, however, and learns things the tough way. She and Calvin bond.

Rebecca Logan (Dilshad Vadsaria) - A young ZBZ pledge and slightly bratty politician's daughter. Rebecca has some less than pure intentions behind a lot of her actions, but underneath it all is just a girl who wants love from her constantly absent and less than capable father. Rebecca and Evan become a little too close for Casey's comfort, and she eventually begins to bond with Cappie.

Dale Kettlewell (Clark Duke) - An uptight conservative Southern Baptist who proudly displays a Confederate flag above his bed and goes to sleep to the sound of gospel music. Dale and Rusty become good friends, despite Dale's staunch anti-Greek activism, although he spends a good amount of time warning Rusty of the dangers of pledging himself to a life full of such sin. He loosens up a bit as Rusty and Calvin widen his world-view.

There are plenty of loveable background characters, such as the conniving Frannie (president of ZBZ) and goofy KT member Beaver (go ahead and ask him how he got his name, go on.) A lot of issues that college students actually tackle are addressed here, such as the stress of the Greek system, sexual pressures and expectations, and how to balance a school life and a personal life. There's plenty of funny times amongst the seriousness, so one never has to worry about whether or not they're going to laugh.

Now, be warned. For those who are just getting into this series, this is only the first ""chapter"". While it is a normal television season (ten episodes) the ""full"" season is composed of chapters one and two. This DVD includes the episodes...

3302915,3,B0011UBDS6,"There are basically (2) reasons I like this show; college newbie RUSTY CARTWRIGHT is a very dorky looking innocent and enthusiastic nerd/geek and his many endearing qualities grew on me quickly, and the ""Animal House"" like fraternity KTT - because they're such an odd mix of weird characters but they come up with some fun activities.

Outside of that you get to enjoy (or in my case ""NOT"") the never ending back-stabbing, conniving, bitchiness of the characters of the ZBZ sorority sisters.  And while of course there are people like this in real life, I'm sick to death of it on TV.  People growing up thinking this is how they should be, how they need to be to make it.  And, if it was ""real life"" those ""sisters"" would've gotten physical - and would've been kicked out of the house.  I can't see anyone living in that caustic of an environment for long.  Other characters are VERY sterotypical...

Amazingly, this takes place in Ohio - but the weather in the show seems to be more like California or Florida. They wear shorts and sleeveless tops etc. pretty much the whole school year long - occasionally a hat or a sweat-jacket (hoodie) is worn.  And except for a VERY FEW episodes, nobody seems to have class or study. Where all the money comes from for most of the things these college kids do is also a wonder. Are they ALL from rich parents?  They seem to have endless financial resources - none of them having to work and they throw elaborate parties and activities with all kinds of expensive catering and decorating and costumes etc.

Overall, I didn't think it was all that realistic or interesting of a show but watching young Rusty (aka ""spitter"") grow/mature, and the antics of the KTT house was entertaining.",1346803200,,1725,4.644736842105263

I still can't figure out if we're supposed to like Casey or not. And the sorority girls get really annoying. I guess there is a certain audience for this, which is not me.

If you're a guy that's into girls and parties, and don't really think about much else, this show is probably for you as well.",1330214400,3,639,4.378151260504202

The show follows Casey, Cappie, and Evan (who are all in their third year) and the trials and tribulations that they face in their respected sororities and fraternities.

What gets interesting is when Rusty (Casey's awkward and nerdy brother) shows up. He adds a different perspective to the show. He's out of his element yet he pledges anyways in order to get the full ""college experience"". I like Rusty so much because his character allows for great diversity (among the already diverse cast) as he shakes things up. The characters are likable and they develop wonderfully as the show goes on. The plot always keeps you wanting more. I can't even describe how lovely the show is.

I would also like to point out that this show is age friendly! I loved it so much that after I purchased it I got my mom, dad, and grandma into it (plus a few friends my own age).

3302937,5,B0011UBDS6,"Like many reviewers I was shocked upon my first visit to Cyprus Rhodes University.  Having been almost attacked with promos all spring in 2007 the series just seemed over the top, stereotypical and bland so I passed when the series initially aired.  But then a friend insisted that I watched the series.  And to my pleasant surprise I discovered a wonderfully entertaining and funny story of a group of kids just trying to survive the college experience.

 In the pilot many of the characters are presented as 2-Dimensional stereotypes.  You have the preppy boys, the hot/only-mildly-smart girl, the religious Texan, the nerd with the insane GPA and on and on.  But not thirty minutes into the series the writers start to peal back the layers of the characters showing the audience their true aspirations, fears, and heartache.  Within several episodes the characters have evolved from archetypes to people you very well could have gone to college with.  The people who you ate with in the dinning hall, the people you crammed with before finals, your friends.

 But I don't want to give the wrong impression of the show.  First and foremost this is a quirky soap-comedy.  Straying away from territory put forth by the perma-depressing ""Felicity"" or the too literal realm of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Dawson's Creek,"" the college presented in ""Greek"" is a understandably a fantasy college.  Money is never an issue, while the characters are seen in class they seem to have as much free time in the world (especially since not one of them have a part-time job).  But it is in the characters that you feel hooked into the series.

 Put into a satirical almost fantasy-like world of the ultimate view of college (complete with 300 sq ft dorm rooms), these characters are the heart of the show.  I know that for myself while I was entertained immensely from the amusing weekly shenanigans (which range from a depression-era speak-easy party, to a quest to make it rain beer, and having to run from an escaped mental patient) but it was the dynamic between the characters, the relationships, that brought me back episode after episode.

 ""Greek"" is not a perfect show. It is cheaply made and obviously first-and-foremost aimed at those not yet in college.  But for those who enjoy great character structure there is enough poignancy in this return trip to college to definitely make up for the price of admission.  Highly Recommended.

  The Special Features on the DVD include: a selection of deleted scenes, a sneak peak at ""Chapter 2"" (which is already available on DVD with `Chapter 3' as well), the featurette ""Greek: The Initiation"" (which is a behind-the-scenes look at the conception of the show, casting, and the initial several days of filming, and three commentaries (Creator Shawn Piller and cast talk over the ""Pilot,"" while members of the cast discuss ""Friday Night Frights"" and ""Separation Anxiety.""",1249689600,2,2915,4.948559670781893

3302939,5,B0011UBDS6,"Greek is unique in that it begins by setting up a series of stereotypical characters--the nerdy freshman, the southern fundamentalist, the sorority girl, the jerk boyfriend, the closeted gay guy--and then, over the course of the season's run, destroys each and every stereotype.

By gradually adding depth to the characters and then letting them run loose in the college setting, the show's creators have managed to create believable and interesting situations that balance drama and comedy. The snappy writing is supported by strong ensemble acting. Ultimately, the show succeeds at what it sets out to do: to create a group of interesting characters that interact with one another in interesting ways.

The series is an interesting peak into college life in general and Greek life especially -- both the good and the bad, but mostly the good.  The reason why I couldn't give this DVD set more than three stars is because of the profanity (mild as it is), the promiscuity, and the binge drinking.  Oh, and then there's the sorority president prostituting one of her sisters to keep one of the popular guys in the most popular fraternity attached to their sorority.  Then that same sister dresses her sorority up like tramps to keep another fraternity from winning a floor hockey game.  This is not something that belongs on a so-called family network.  If you 16 or older you'll enjoy this series; if you're younger than that your parents should be blocking it.",1215302400,8,858,4.6866666666666665
3302956,5,B0011UBDS6,"ok, this whole series is great!  i can't wait for the second season on dvd and was glad the series was renewed.  but i'm in 'lust' with cappie!

this series is NOT 'animal house' and there is plenty of angst to go around, but basically the series is very funny and very watchable.

3302957,5,B0011UBDS6,"I've only recently gotten into the show ""Greek"", but I'm so glad I found it. When I first saw promos for the show I dismissed it, because, um...it's on ABC Family. I thought it would be a lame - heavy on the PG side of things - comedy series that wouldn't even be close to the college life I've experienced. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised when I finally caught an episode a few weeks ago, and then promptly ordered the DVD set.

""Greek"" is such a witty, fun show. It doesn't sidestep the racier elements of college, but it also doesn't make it it's primary focus either. The characters are awesome (I heart Dale. Outside of infomercials, you don't see many Christian rock loving characters on TV) and the relationships are complex, realistic, and inspire many a chant of 'OMG. Just get back together already!'. Cappie and Casey, I'm looking at you. And I look menacing.

As for the DVD set, there isn't a whole lot on there. But I enjoyed finding out what roles certain actors tried out for in the beginning (Scott Michael Foster/'Cappie' was originally going to be Calvin? What?), only later to get another role instead. Also, some of the guys in the cast do commentary for one episode and much hilarity ensues.",1211587200,5,1224,4.584474885844749

This show is quite refreshing.  In the midst of all of the shows aimed at teens which aim to show teens acting beyond their years, this one is much more young and fresh.  Sex is not at the helm of this show, and only a couple times has it been a centric theme.  It shows a group of young adults enjoying their lives, freedom, friendship and college.  This is what I wish my college experience would have been like.",1211155200,2,568,5.558139534883721
3302959,4,B0011UBDS6,"It's about time! a show about teenagers which isn't only about a boy and a girl being together and talking about how they feel for each other over and over (we have some but it's not only about them).So we follow the freshmen year of several characters when they arrive to college. Of course we have all the cliches of the genre (betrayal,love,friends,ect...)but in a light and not too soapy way. It's like American Pie became a TV show without the horny geeks (we still have some though,but they're not the main characters).Plus,there's a big change compared to the shows of my youth,the gay guy (who isn't a crazy queen or a depressed kid who feel cursed) is as important and developped as the rest of the characters of the show,and it's a nice and modern way to put it. And of course,the soundtrack is huge! Hope it will be released in France,where I'm from.",1208217600,8,861,4.561290322580645
3302960,3,B0011UBDS6,"While one understands that this show has to be entertaining in order to survive I believe that it doesn't properly showcase what being a member of a Fraternity/Sorority is about.

8242479,5,B0011UBDS6,"Note: The show itself: 5 Stars-great show, funny, very smart, diverse set of characters, lots of pop culture references-pretty much can't say enough good things about it. However, I admit the picture quality is not good. This isn't the seller's fault, though. It's just when the show was transferred to DVD it was obviously not a priority for the production company. The packaging was fine, the discs weren't scratched or anything, just don't expect a crisp, HD looking picture. Expect it to look how it would watching on streaming site like N*tflix or SD when the show originally aired. Still totally worth getting, because the show's so good.",1476489600,,644,4.972222222222222
