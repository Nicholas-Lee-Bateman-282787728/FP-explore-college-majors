8271755,4,B001934SPA,"I saw this movie at the premier in San Antonio.  Most of the film was shot in San Antonio, most of the crew are local as well.  Overall I would call it a good B action movie.  I liked the acting performances of the shop owners and the deaf robber and black robber.  The insurance agent was hot as well.  It's amazing the quality of film they delivered on the budget they were working with.  Support your local artist, buy it.",1218240000,2,425,4.185185185185185
