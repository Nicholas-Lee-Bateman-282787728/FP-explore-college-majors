923078,3,6304601867,"Matt Corrdell won't stay dead. And this time he's back to clear the name of a cop who kills someone in a foiled robbery, but the footage shown made it look to be her fault, when it was defence. And onc eher name is cleared, for some reason Matt Cordell wants to pot her as his bride.

This one didn't make a lot of sense to me in a few parts. But it has all your cheesy horror movie cliches in it that make this just a late night thriller for those who wanna be entertained and who won't go nitpicking on details and plot lines.

I really lked the ending of the film. It was really a blazing way to go out.

Here's to looking forward to Maniac Cop 4, hopefully.

They should release this as a box set or something. Have the trilogy on one disc maybe? Hell, they didn't bother to include ANY bonus features so 3 of them will fit on a four hour disc.",1122076800,,848,4.0

923080,4,6304601867,"Considering the fact that William Lustig (director) and Larry Cohen (writer/producer), creators of the two predecessors, were also responsible for this follow-up, it's not surprising that also Maniac Cop 3 turns out to  be pretty good - even though Lustig stopped filming after 24 days and was  replaced by another director. The cast, including Robert Davi (No Contest)  and Robert Forster (Scanner Cop 2), is decent, and you can spot Ted Raimi  (Skinner) in a cameo. There are quite some new and interesting ideas, and  the whole movie's pace should satisfy any undemanding horror buff, although  the end is closer to an action than to a genre flick. Lustig is currently  trying to raise money for another sequel - and if it is as good as this  one, why not? If you look at Lustig's (in)famous Maniac, it is obvious his  style is getting better and better. If directed by some other b-movie  filmmaker, this might have turned out to be just another cheap trash movie.  Of course, MC3 is not a masterpiece, it's just good thrills for horror  fans.

923531,5,6304601867,"So awesome to see this trilogy out on Blu-ray and updated. Mayeb it's because when I was a little kid I saw Maniac Cop 2 and 3 before I ever saw 1, and always dug 3 the most. Best kill scenes. Maniac Cop looks the sickest (he just gets uglier with each sequel). Either way, you can't lose with any one of the Maniac Cop flicks. No, do not expect stellar acting and screenwriting. But, you will get QUALITY original, old-school slasher entertainment that can only be re-made and imitated but never duplicated. I'm surprised Quentin Tarantino hasn't already taken a crack at the slasher genre, ""borrowing"" many aspects of this killer trilogy. If you're new to the series, start with the first and work your way up. But all of them are essential pieces to any real horror and other film-fanatic fan's collection.

923605,4,6304601867,"Plagued with behind the scenes problems, lacking an agreed-upon and strong script and with last minute cast changes it is a wonder that Maniac Cop 3 is as good and as shamelessly fun as it is. Director William Lustig has since taken his name off it and so the film is presented now as an Alan Smithee feature but despite this and despite, according to the producer, Larry Cohen never providing a finished script, there is a lot to love about this concluding part of the trilogy. In Halloween 2 style and because there was a lower budget, the main body of the film takes place in and around a hospital and so the wild car chases and grimy city streets are not so present in part 3 until you get to the insane last ten minutes of the film, but more of that later.
So, some good things about the film then. Firstly, Maniac Cop 3 looks great. The cinematographer, Jacques Haitkin (Nightmare on Elm Street), makes it look like a glossy, big budget affair. The actors are having a ball, Robert Davi steps up his action man game as McKinney and even gets into some forced, ham fisted, lip locking with Dr. Susan Fowler (Caitlin Dulany). There is a stand out scene with Robert Forster (Vigilante/Alligator/Jackie Brown) and Paul Gleason (Breakfast Club, Trading Places, Die Hard) that is hilarious and worth watching the film for! The kills have been made more elaborate in this one as well. It's not just a stalk and slash with a baton concealed blade, in this, our local, friendly maniac cop kills people in all sorts of elaborate ways. The most inventive of which is strapping someone to an X-Ray machine and pelting them with radiation continually till their face melts. It's both horrifying and hilarious in equal measure.
Now to that action packed finale! If you thought you'd seen it all when they lit Cordell on fire for 10 minutes, threw him through a wall and four stories down into a bus that explodes, at the end of the part 2, then you are in for a surprise because the end of Maniac Cop 3 takes the car chase and the burning from part 2 and ramps it up to 11. It's a really incredible sequence to have achieved.
So are there any downsides to Part 3?
Well, yes, the main one being the lack of a great Jay Chattaway score, it doesn't have the edgier, grittier vibe of the previous two films, it's clearly filmed in LA and no attempt is even made to hide it or make it look New York-like in any way and it can be a little hard to follow in places as the plot is convoluted in the extreme but, ultimately, as much as I would've loved to have seen what Lustig and Cohen could've done with a part 3 at full strength, maybe what we got is as good as you could possibly get from stretching the zombie cop angle out to a part 3.
Yes, like most 80s and 90s franchises, the films get increasingly goofy and over the top but the third one, despite some flaws, remembers to never stop being scary, action packed, comedy fuelled fun. How many films can you say that about nowadays?

BLU-RAY REVIEW
Much like the Blu-Ray for Maniac Cop 2, Part 3, the collector's edition, is a Blu-Ray/DVD Combo pack, boasts a strong transfer, a crisp image, a pretty good sound mix and a strong set of extras. It's worth pointing out that Maniac Cop 3 had a much better quality version out on the market already, compared to part 2, but the full 1080p HD image on this disc, presented in its original aspect ratio of 2.35:1, is still definitely worth the upgrade. Cop 3 only gets a 5.1 DTS-HD audio transfer but on my set up I didn't notice a huge difference.
As for the extras, you get the documentary ""Wrong Arm Of The Law"" which attempts to explain Maniac Cop 3's troubled production. The main draw here is William Lustig and producer (and uncredited director of some scenes) Joel Soisson talking candidly about their differences and the production problems. Larry Cohen is there too, a little, but I couldn't tell if he really wanted to be or not. The making of also talks to some of the cast and crew, all of whom, somewhat, stay either neutral or side with the producer but without ever attacking Lustig. It's fascinating and it's the closest we'll ever get to what happened but I can't say I was much the wiser when it finished. Either, politeness or memory keeps the conclusion pretty vague.
There are also a great number of deleted and extended scenes on the disc, which is always enjoyable and a fun opportunity to sort of form your own edit of the film in your head.
Rounding out the package is a trailer, a gallery and the original synopsis for the film, which is very cool and fascinating to see what might have been.
The disc is also region free and should be viewable on any Blu-Ray player worldwide, although this has not been tested by me.
All in all a worthwhile purchase and a definitive edition.",1384732800,2,4790,4.430839002267573

923681,3,6304601867,"Like the previous two films in the series, Maniac Cop 3: Badge Of Silence (1993) is an ultra-violent affair that features former New York City policeman Matt Cordell (Robert Z'Dar) committing all manner of mayhem.  Unfortunately while credible plots have never been a strong point in the series, this time the story is probably the most farfetched and dumbest so far.  Cordell is typically motivated by vengeance, but here his actions seem particularly twisted and obscure, apparently guided by feelings of affection.  The screenplay by Larry Cohen delivers plenty of cartoonish violence, but fails to produce a story that ties these events together very credibly.  Indicative of the problems with the film, director William Lustig, who directed the first two Maniac Cop films, quit Maniac Cop 3 because of creative differences, and was replaced by Joel Soisson.

Officer Katie Sullivan (Gretchen Becker) is critically injured in a shootout at a drugstore, and is taken to a local hospital, where after an operation, she is apparently brain dead.  Frank Jessup (Jackie Earle Haley), the criminal who shot her, is also recuperating in the same hospital.  Robert Davi who appeared in Manic Cop 2, returns as police detective Sean McKinney, a close friend of Officer Sullivan.  Both Jessup and Sullivan are under the care of Dr. Susan Fowler (Caitlin Dulany).

At the conclusion of Maniac Cop 2, Matt Cordell was lying dead in a coffin.  At the start of Maniac Cop 3, a voodoo priest named Houngan (Julius Harris), through a ceremony involving human sacrifice, brings Cordell back to the world of the living.  Apparently lonely, Cordell takes an interest in officer Sullivan, and visits the hospital several times committing acts of violence, before eventually adducting her.  With Houngan's help, Cordell hopes to bring Sullivan back to life.  McKinney and Fowler get on Cordell's trail, and ruin his plans.  Justifiably upset, the maniac cop attempts to kill the pair, while they are in an ambulance, on the way to the hospital.

The film features a couple of gunfights, a fire in a church, and a crazy chase through the city streets.  While the action sequences are clearly the highlights of the film, the writing could have used some tightening up.  Voodoo as a source for re-animation seems pretty weak.  Cordell moving through the hospital unnoticed, is unlikely.  A tunnel that leads from the hospital, directly to Houngan's church, is much too convenient.  And altering Cordell's basic motivations, undermines the whole premise of the series, and makes him unsympathetic.  Playing things straight and serious, Robert Davi helps lend credibility, but there are many other issues to be overcome.  Maniac Cop 3 delivers some decent action and destruction, but the story behind the mayhem is probably the weakest in the series, as the movie comes in with a rating of 2.5 stars.",1315958400,5,2878,5.104700854700854
923682,4,6304601867,"At the gravesite, I loved how they asked for forgiveness for Maniac Cop Cordell, ""we'll not sit in judgment.""  Why not?  The guy killed a b-zillion people in 3 films.  I'm certain all those characters would disagree, but there you have it, he's back and he's still miffed.

I love how they keep avoiding his face in all three films, as though we haven't already seen him, as though we don't know who he is, as though that could ratchet up the suspense or fright....or maybe the camera man wasn't tall enough to keep it in the shot?

For me, the most shocking scene was Robert Davi's character smoking in a hospital.

This entry in the series is very bizarre.  I still don't understand the whole ritualistic head stabbing thing to bring Maniac Cop back to life.  It's not as if he wasn't already an expert in that regard.  I also saw more similarities to Phantom of the Opera than anything else as poor misunderstood Maniac tried to get himself a brain dead wife (all that lurking about in the steam piped walkways beneath the hospital).  He might be decomposing but he still needs love.

I rate this as being on par with the other two.  I'm glad I have the whole collection now.",1314835200,5,1178,4.453271028037383
923683,4,6304601867,"As some others have rightly pointed out, this film isn't quite as good as either of its predecessors. That having been said, it's still a fairly good horror flick and does a decent job following up on the previous two films.

As with part two, this ones takes off directly after its predecessor and continues the story with, again, a couple of surviving cast members from part two. The plot is somewhat lacking compared to the previous offerings, but the musical score is, in my opinion, probably the best out of the entire trilogy.

Yes, there is about 30 seconds in total of re-used footage from part two here (as in non-flashback, re-used to save money and not to provide back story). I won't begrudge them that since lots of lower budgets films do it, but it was kind of funny. At least it was tastefully done and could probably be missed by someone that hadn't just watched part two the day before (like me!).

As far as the action scenes, this movie is probably somewhere between the first and second films, up until the end. The car chase is pretty good, longer than expected but good throughout. The stunts in this part of the trilogy are fairly well done, especially the scenes with Maniac Cop being on fire. In fact, this has some of the best 'fire suite' stunt work I've seen in a long time, horror movies or otherwise. Really top notch stuff.

Bottom line though, if you liked the first and second films, you need to add this to your collection and finish off the trilogy. At the price, you can't go wrong and despite its flaws, it's still a great horror flick.

Get it while you can, since it was hard to obtain for a many years and may not be available in the future. This is a real classic and should be in every horror buff's DVD collection.",1294531200,,1757,4.427244582043343
923684,3,6304601867,"Yep, this dvd holds the R-rated cut of the film.
The weakest entree in the series. Perhaps because producer Joel Soisson took the film out of director William Lustig's hands and shot many scenes himself behind Lustig's back. He constantly interfered with production until Lustig finally walked off. Soisson finished the film himself and stuck Lustig's name on the credits. It gets a bonus point for also starring Jackie Earle Haley. I'de rather have this 'Maniac Cop' flick than none.

923686,3,6304601867,"The Cohen/Lustig team return for Maniac Cop 3, but the results aren't so hot.
Matt Cordell has been resurrected by witchdoctor/shaman/homeless guy, Julius Harris.  I'm not really sure why.  Harris babbles some junk about Cordell being a ""restless soul"", but doesn't really explain why he brought him back to life.  Maybe it was a slow day and he didn't have much else to do.  Detective McKinney(Robert Davi) is also back and he's so cool he doesn't even bother to wear ear protection at the shooting range.  When McKinney's friend and fellow officer, Katie(Gretchen Becker) is seriously wounded in a drugstore shootout, she's rushed to the hospital where McKinney looks after her.  Then Cordell springs into action!  He goes to the hospital, killing everyone in his way, to get to the dying woman(sounds a lot like Halloween 2, doesn't it?).  Why?  I'm not too sure.  He wants to marry her or sees her as some kind of soulmate or some ridiculous nonsense.  You know a horror series is getting a bit long in the tooth when plots like this start popping up.  When a story that involved a killer zombie-like cop with a grudge against the police department starts delving into spiritual hocus pocus and romance, it's about time to hang it up I'd say.  So in the end, McKinney must once again square off with Cordell to save his friend's soul.
This sequel wasn't terribly impressive.  It had it's moments and was just entertaining enough to keep you watching, but when compared to the two previous films, it's a big letdown.  There's just too much lollygagging and it never seems as though anything's really going on.  The kills aren't very impressive, and even the great Robert Z'Dar is terribly underused.  Plus the climax is a bit too drawn out.  You get the feeling that the film was made just for the sake of making it considering the limp noodle plot.  But even with it's shortcomings,  Maniac Cop 3 isn't all that bad especially when you consider the state of straight to DVD horror titles these days.",1228780800,2,2003,4.734104046242774

923688,4,6304601867,"I thought Maniac Cop was an excellent film. It was well paced and didn't leave much fat to pad the movie down. I recently bought part third because the second one has yet to see the light of day. Why is that anyways? Well this movie is still good. It reminds me of Halloween 2 in a way. It contained a little more creative kills but nothing speical. Highly recommend this movie to horror fans. This has to be one of the most underrated horror movie franchises around. You can pick up 1 and 3 for less then ten bucks, do it!",1204761600,,523,4.137254901960785
923689,5,6304601867,"Matt Cordell, once a respected officer of the law, but now a rage-driven zombie, forced to live an excistence as neither living or dead.

This time he's out to get the persons responsible for a accident that put a female cop in coma.

The movie is very entertaining, perhaps even better than part 2(wich I also liked very mutch) It has good and talented actors, not teenage amateurs like in most other slasher films. The effects are also great, especially a burning car chase that must've been very complicated and unpleasant for the stuntman.

So if you liked part 2(Like I did) then go and get this one as well.",1140998400,2,613,4.554545454545455

7877143,4,6304601867,"I'll just give a quick review of the bonus documentary on this Bluray. It's pretty short, about 20-25 minutes,  but a lot is covered in that time with the actors, producer and director and if you like hearing about drama behind the scenes this is for you. Not so much with the actors but producer/director/writer as they had a missing script, which I think may have deliberately gone missing out of spite, and the director who eventually just walked off the set never to return. It's a tasty feature on the disc you'll want to check out. Sadly, no commentaries on the disc. There's deleted scenes also I haven't dug into.  I still have to re-watch the movie, it's been like 20 years.",1485216000,2,683,4.544715447154472
