3788503,5,B001T6KW4I,"This is the best Spider-Man series ever made.  It's fast paced yet has a clear clever story line.  Much much better than Spider-Man the animated series of the 1990's.  The characters act a lot more believable.  This series is the Bat Man TAS of it's day.  It draws from the original Amazing Spider-Man comic stories and the Ultimate Spider-Man comics to blend them in to the best retelling of the Spider-Man ethos that has yet been produced.  Sure you can wait to buy it cheaper, but if you like a great quality animated series like this one then paying for it now will only encourage the production of more.

Just one word to the other raters.  What is the point of rating something based on price and not the quality of the product.  Why would anyone buy something for their 3 year old before watching it?  Super Hero comics and most cartoons have some level of violence and sexuality in them.  They are geared towards teens and adults not toddlers.  Maybe you should have bought them a Snoopy DVD instead.",1244160000,,1008,4.538888888888889
3788504,1,B001T6KW4I,"My 3 year old loves spiderman so I bought this movie.  The dialogue between Spiderman and Cat Lady has sexual undertones.  I returned the movie, I would not recommend this for children.",1243296000,2,185,4.75
3788505,3,B001T6KW4I,"My sons (ages 6 and 4) love this new animated series, The Spectacular Spider-Man. The show is much better suited for younger audiences than Spider-Man's last animated series, which lasted only one season on MTV in 2003.

This series features all of Spider-Man's most famous villians, including the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Vulture, Rhino and Electro.

In Volume 4, Peter Parker dons the black suit, faces the Sinister Six (Vulture, Electro, Shocker, Sandman, Rhino, and Doctor Octopus) and ends the first season against his deadliest foe, Venom/Eddie Brock. Volume 4 has four episodes: Episode 10: ""Persona""; Episode 11: ""Group Therapy""; Episode 12: ""Intervention"" and Episode 13: ""Nature vs. Nurture"".

If you absolutely must buy a DVD right now (birthday present, etc.) this is a good choice for Spider-Man fans. Amazon has the DVD priced $5 below suggested retail price ($19.95) and this is a good choice for young children who love Spider-Man.

The more economical decision is to wait for a DVD set release of all 26 episodes from Seasons 1 and 2, which should be priced around $30. It was announced earlier this year that Season 2 would move from the CW network to Disney XD. Season 2 is scheduled to begin in March 2009. However, the Spectacular Spider-Man ended production after completing the 26th episode (the end of Season 2). A third season might happen, depending on the ratings Season 2 gets on Disney XD.

In summary, I'd rate The Spectacular Spider-Man series five stars based on the entertainment value for young superhero fans. The shows are accessible without being too scary or adult for the under-10 audience. However, by marketing the first season into four DVDs, I deduct two stars. The series is overpriced, especially in light of the current economy.",1235692800,10,1788,5.047457627118644

3788515,4,B001T6KW4I,"My four year old granddaughter Grace loves Spider-Man so I rented this DVD for her.  She was mad when she came to my house and I didn't have it so I bought it.  Now she watches it everytime she visits. I find myself watching it with her.  The characters are nicely portrayed with pleasant voices and even though there is some violence it is not dark and menacing. This DVD has only four episodes of the first season so I have ordered the DVD with the whole first season. I will definitely get the 2nd season when it comes out, hopefully on one DVD!",1247270400,4,548,4.25

8340744,5,B001T6KW4I,"Simply put, this is a great series. Bought them for my son and he loves them. Being a Spider-Man fan since my childhood I can say that the Spectacular Spider-Man cartoon gives a very solid rendition of Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Full of fun animation, quirky dialogue and an overall great story line, Spectacular Spider-Man will make Spidey fans proud. This comes second only to the 90's Amazing Spider-Man cartoons. Definitely recommend.",1437177600,,440,5.125
