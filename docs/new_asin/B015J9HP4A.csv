7441815,5,B015J9HP4A,"This film tells most but not all of the story of the hardest working man in show business.  The one thing missing from this film is that Mr. Brown always made clear to young people the importance of staying in school.  In fact he had a big hit record on the R&B charts in the mid sixties called ""Don't be a Dropout"" and made reference to this point on a number of other recordings.  He also made one of the very few patriotic R&B songs called ""America is My Home"". Prior to this recording the only other R&B artists to write or record patriotic songs were Chuck Berry, Back in the U.S.A., Curtis Mayfield & The Impressions, This is My Country and The Drifters who recorded the original version of Only In America.  Unfortunately, Atlantic Records did not think that was the right time to release it by them.  So instead they recorded it with a white group called Jay and the Americans.  But the film is great and it is clearly worth the time and money to buy it.",1451260800,10,962,4.316666666666666

7441817,5,B015J9HP4A,"Think about the musical landscape before James Brown came along.

At the time, Elvis, and the new genre of rock and roll, was probably the most controversial and dangerous new thing in pop culture. Mr. Brown was still trying to find his voice. He was singing familiar styled blues and R&B songs. Kansas City, for example, became one of his early staples. By 1959 rock and roll nearly died; then came the Beatles, Motown, and a host of cultural upheavals during the 1960s.

Out of this decade of upheaval emerged the Godfather of Soul. He surrounded himself with great players and he found what he could do, and do well  bring the funk and soul. Nobody had heard anything like Cold Sweat, or Papas Got a Brand New Bag, or Say It Loud.""  Imagine what it must have been like to hear these songs for the first time!

The Rise of James Brown chronicles this time period; his climb to the top. This is not a survey of his entire career, but the period in which he was the most innovative, politically active, and a force to be reckoned with. So much so, that in 1969 LOOK Magazine placed him on their cover asking if he was the most important Black man in America.

The documentary includes fresh interviews with significant people associated with Mr. Brown, including, Jabo Starks, Clyde Stubblefield, Maceo Parker, Melvin Parker (with a story about pulling a gun on Mr. Brown!), Pee Wee Ellis, Danny Ray, Alan Leeds, Bootsy Collins, Fred Wesley, Bobby Byrd, Martha High, and Al Sharpton. Informative and entertaining stories are shared about different events in his life including his appearances on the Ed Sullivan show, the Boston concert, his natural vs his conk, how his songs were written, his business dealings, and a segment by Mick Jagger (conveniently one of the producers) telling how James Brown did NOT upstage the Stones on the T.A.M.I. show.

This DVD includes great interviews, footage, and insightful backstories. With that said, I felt like it ended rather abruptly  either that or I just didn't want the story telling to end! A comment was made in the documentary about Browns mustache period (a reference to his look in the 70s) and the next thing I knew the movie was over. In my humble opinion Mr. Brown deserves to have the other periods of his life chronicled, as well, and perhaps the producers and financiers (including Mick Jagger) will find the time to tell the rest of JBs story with the same quality as The Rise of James Brown.

Fans of Mr. Dynamite need to get on the good foot and check out this DVD!",1449187200,18,2527,4.635346756152125
7441818,5,B015J9HP4A,"haven't watched this all the way thru but I am secure in giving it 5 stars. I learned more about JB here (and I'm a studious fan since 1966) than any documentary and I appreciate how professionally done were the interviews w the JB players and behind the scenes support. Great team of Leeds and Weinger ensured class!

Longtime fans will be stunned to find live material from a concert attended by Doctor Martin Luther King, in 1965, following a long March for Civil Rights. One realizes how important Brown was even at that early juncture in the fight. Most of us recall mainly the 1968 ""makeshift"" concert for Peace within 24 hours of the death of King.

Brown: Musical innovator and cultural emanicipator; poet; choreographer; show business savant. All covered nicely and consisely. However, I *did* find some unnecessary negatives about JB, courtesy of Melvin Parker and Mick Jagger.",1448150400,3,887,4.906666666666666

7441823,3,B015J9HP4A,"First half of the DVD is fantastic!  Lots of great footage of the early James Brown days.  Interesting interviews and documentary.  Of course the music and live shows are electric!  The second half of the DVD is devoted largely to the civil rights movement and politics.  While an important part of James Brown's life, so much time is devoted to the subject that it takes away from the music.  Perhaps a 2nd DVD could have been included to cover that material.  Meanwhile, would have enjoyed watching more live performances, especially with Catfish and Bootsy Collins.  Overall, very worthy of a viewing.",1489449600,3,604,4.910891089108911

This film is excellent and captures the essence of James Brown, the man and the music. He definitely was the hardest working man in show business. His drive and ambition coupled with his amazing and awesome talent is showcased well in Mick Jagger's fantastic documentary. Seeing James Brown in person was the only way to really experience the real Mr. Dynamite and here you get to be exposed to his live performances.

It provided the chance to understand a lot more about the R&B and Funk music that still has a huge impact in the 21st century. It gave us a glimpse into the genius of the man...and a compelling look at the complexity of the man haunted by a horrific past of neglect and racism. We got a chance to understand how smart he was with the hint of some of his business dealings. Most people don't know how many radio stations he owned at one time. It was amazing accomplishment of a long and storied career that spanned 5 decades. The exclusion of the traumas of his personal life were understood as being out of scope of this piece.,1465171200,3,684,4.436507936507937

8733777,2,B015J9HP4A,"Far too much emphasis on JB Bandmembers ....and not NEARLY enough on THE FAMOUS FLAMES.
If you were to believe this DVD , James Brown was always a ""solo"" act, and  never sang with a VOCAL GROUP.
Everybody knows otherwise, of course, as proved by the huge sales figures generated by the T.A.M.I. SHOW DVD.
(But then , MICK JAGGER wouldn't WANT you to remember that,of course, since James and The Flames came out before the Stones at that legendary 1964 concert, and CLEANED THEIR CLOCKS onstage...and ,as the producer of the film ""GET ON UP"" and this DVD, JAGGER had the unique opportunity to control the output of  BOTH films, so that important facts were just ""conveniently left out"").
Like the fact that JAMES BROWN & THE FAMOUS FLAMES were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 (Brown) and in 2012 (The Famous Flames) . Not ONCE was it ever mentioned in EITHER film.
In fact, without BOBBY BYRD and The Famous Flames , there would have never even BEEN a ""James Brown"" . He would have still been rotting away in prison on a 8-16 year stretch for Robbery. It was BOBBY BYRD and his family that got him out in the  FIRST PLACE . And, as stated in Wikipedia: ""It was, in fact, Bobby Byrd and The Famous Flames who launched BROWN'S career, not the other way around. Indeed, the majority of Brown's early recordings between 1956 and 1962 were not solo recordings, but as a member of the Famous Flames"".
This is an entirely ACCURATE statement.
THE FAMOUS FLAMES were a very important part of Brown's early career....since James actually BEGAN his career as a member of The Flames . Yet, they are only mentioned in passing (and very briefly, in fact) on this DVD.
If, indeed, the TITLE of this DVD is correct, and is supposed to cover ""The RISE"" of James Brown, It SHOULD have focused his early years...meaning his R&B ""Mr Dynamite"" years with The Famous Flames....not on his ""Funk"" era. That wasn't until some TEN YEARS LATER. That would have made the title far more accurate. My verdict ?
It could have been better...
Because The Famous Flames DESERVED better.",1528416000,,2072,4.564516129032258

I thought this movie would be the story of his life, but the first three quarters is him before 1970, with very, very little on him afterwards. The 80s is 3 minutes on how he influenced hip hop. A lot happened in his life from 1970 on- too much focus is placed on him in the late 60s. The people interviewed are cool, but Al Sharpton is in this movie way, WAY too much. this is worth seeing for the footage, but I wouldnt recommend buying it. The 4 and a half star rating this dvd gets on Amazon is just wrong. TOO MANY TIMES have I read raves of things on amazon, to buy them and find they are NOT worthy of 4, 5 stars or whatever.

8733781,5,B015J9HP4A,"For those that love the music of James Brown and roots/origin of R&B/Soul/Funk, this two-hour documentary covers the rise of James from a life of poverty and neglect to creating an exciting genre/style with his personal stamp on it.  There are interviews with fellow band members/collaborators:  Bobby Bland, Maceo Parker, Melvin Parker, Albert ""Pee Wee"" Ellis, Danny Ray, Bootsy Collins and more. Audio, video and footage quality are all excellent in this Mick Jagger-produced work.

Almost as important as the outcome of the mission of James Brown was his quest in getting there:  his difificult childhood, the many personal sacrifices on the long road, living a life of poverty while working his way up, dealing with racial indifference.....and emerging on the other side of a hard and long journey. Besides Little Richard and Smoky Robinson, James Brown was one of the most significant African-American entertainers on the scene in the '50s.

His music/stage presence crafted a unique style which went on to influence the likes of Michael Jackson, Prince, Morris Day and many others.  In addition, there are other sides of James' life revealed -- as a perfectionist and activist in social cause for African-American rights.

James Brown's contribution to the shape of modern music as it exists now is immeasurable, and well-represented on this DVD.",1519516800,,1352,5.231481481481482
