8065539,4,B0009RJ63G,"...I figured this might be fun to watch.

It is. I don't know how many times I'll watch it but I'm glad I picked it up.

Randy comes off as a totally down to Earth guy. He gets a little self-serving right at the end but by then it's not a deterant at all. Bill Lee comes off just as you would expect. He's the real deal. MLB needs more players of that caliber who follow their own path in my opinion.

You don't get familiar with any of the other Americans. A few of the Cuban players are spotlighted and I would have liked to see more of them.

I'd recommend watching this if you're a fan of baseball or feel any empathy at all towards the Cuban children that live under Castro's misguided regime.",1182902400,,698,4.110294117647059
