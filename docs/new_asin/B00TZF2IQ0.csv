7026360,4,B00TZF2IQ0,Bought this for my husband as a Birthday Gift. His favorite all time show is Cops. There wasn't alot of wild chases but the clips were still fun to watch.,1436054400,3,154,4.166666666666667
7026361,1,B00TZF2IQ0,"Cops: Wildest Chases looks great, even though it's not a collection of the 'wildest chases', rather it's a collection of seven episodes of Cops from seasons 26 and 27 of the long running police reality show. Therefore I must relegate this release to the realm of 'stocking stuffer'. Pick it up if you're a clueless grandparent and you want something 'fun' to put in a gift-basket for that no-good slacker laying around all day at your Daughter's house. Otherwise, skip it.",1435104000,,472,4.839506172839506

8703554,3,B00TZF2IQ0,You need to have more episodes in one disc because after three or four episodes of only 15 to 20 minutes I can play a play on my own and rehearse the whole damn thing so either you add more episodes to one disc or throw it out the window it was good but you need more episodes because I can I can tell you clearly exactly what happens and I watched it three times you just need more even if you had the price up so what you got to put more on the desk we watch a DVD because we don't have cable and itialy I don't so you need to put 14 episodes hello hello,1501545600,,556,3.7203389830508473
8703555,2,B00TZF2IQ0,"""Cops - Wildest Chases!!"" -
If you Love High-Speed - Adrenaline - Heart Pounding Reckless - Crazy - Insane - Chases - then -
This DVD Isn't for you!!
Title is a Misnomer. Very Misleading title!! Just basically the usual 'Cops' foolishness.
And - This DVD case is one of those Cheapos!! Paper-thin!
BTW - When is 'Cops' going to produce a Box-Set??? A Very Disappointed, Scott M.",1493769600,,378,4.573529411764706
