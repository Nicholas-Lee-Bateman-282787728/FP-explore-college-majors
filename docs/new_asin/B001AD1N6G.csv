It begins with a troop of Cavalry in the background. What are they doing in Texas? A wagon has a problem with a wheel. Roy offers a suggestion to fix it. The Governor doesn't have the money to pay the Rangers, the Army will police the land. ""But they have no experience"" says one man. The Governor has disbanded the Rangers [budgetary constraints are constant]. Will the outlaws take over? Ray will join the Cavalry. [The advantage of a Government job in an economic depression.] A newspaper reports about the threat from ""Desperadoes"". [No Militia or Vigilante Committee?] Can a Private ""State Patrol"" protect ranchers and others? The Cavalry patrol learns about an attack. All are dead! They follow the tracks. Sergeant Roy rescues one horse, the others are taken across the border (this wouldn't stop the Rangers).

[Note the dust from the dry land. No bandannas across their nose and mouth?] Shod horses tell of white men. Roy can't go after those killers as long as he is in the Cavalry. Will he desert? [Note the use of Western saddles rather than regulation Cavalry saddles.] Roy escapes on his distinctive horse! Senator Harvey tells how the ""State Patrol"" can safeguard the people. Roy advises the people to reorganize the Texas Rangers, their honesty has never been questioned. Roy finds a poster on Morgan Burke. The Colonel orders ""Call to Arms"" because his daughter is missing. Roy sings to Mary, then leaves as the Cavalry approaches. Mary tells who kidnapped her - an old man with a long grey beard! ""The Governor!"" Roy locates those stolen horses and overhears the plans for a bank robbery. Burke has a plan. Rogers will be taken and used in the robbery. ""Dead men tell no tales.""

There are plans for protection. Should they use a private corporation instead of a government group? [This political argument still goes on.] Falling rocks allow Roy to escape. There is a chase. [A long shot is used for a stunt double.] ""The White Horse Raiders are coming!"" There is a lot of shooting! Can they call the Cavalry? Roy sabotages the saddles so they will fail when used. The Cavalry arrives and arrests all. Roy is tried and discharged for desertion. But the Governor is reorganizing the Texas Rangers and Rogers will be commissioned.

This is an interesting story with a complex plot. The idea of government officials working with bandits seems revolutionary. But when you read about government officials being convicted of crimes today you'll understand this story. Was there such corruption before 1876?
