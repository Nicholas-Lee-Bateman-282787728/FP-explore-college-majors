8285889,5,B001C476XM,So much did I appreciate this production that I bought another 10 to share.  John Lennox is the ultimate in Christian apologists when it comes to questions of God and science.,1405382400,,175,4.645161290322581
8285890,5,B001C476XM,"if you familiar with ""Mere Christianity"" by Lewis, you know that his approach to the subject was very ecumenical. So is this video.
It simply addresses question whether religion [Christianity] and science overlap.

To rephrase Steve Gould, there is NOMA (non-overlapping magisteria) between the two. That is they never overlap, and those in one area ore of no authority in the other.
Well, so far so good.. but then there is small print. One is objective and about the world, and the other is sort of a personal subjective [existential] view [illusion?]. And of course the one that is objective is science.

McGrath and Lennox argue for POMA (partially overlapping magisteria).

You will have to watch the video to learn more..

you can get it from Fixed Point Foundation",1295740800,3,771,4.953488372093023

Alister McGrath, John Lennox (both Oxford professors), and Larry Taunton (producer) use this format to discuss some of the most important points of the science/christianity debate, such as evolution, the idea that all good scientists are atheists, the idea that science and christianity do not overlap, and the like.

Though the arguments presented are by no means exhaustive, this is a great introduction to the larger cultural discussion that is taking place.

Now I would suggest taking this to the next level and watching the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-God-Delusion-Debate-DVD/dp/B001C19HNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The God Delusion Debate DVD</a>&nbsp;between Dr. Lennox and Professor Richard Dawkins.  In that event, the thoughts that are put forth here can really be seen put to the test and matched up against the thoughts of the atheism.

I highly recommend this, though.  Very thoughtful.",1217980800,9,1176,6.048192771084337
