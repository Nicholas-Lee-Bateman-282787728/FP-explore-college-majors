8323980,4,B0009E2OSI,Cheesy 80's workout from my teen years that is fun to laugh at and fun to watch as well as actually a great cardiofest that gets your heartrate up! I am paying extra to get it put on a disc since the VHS is almost worn out. Great warm up and cool down as well as different levels you can follow for high or low impact.,1523232000,,318,3.8333333333333335
