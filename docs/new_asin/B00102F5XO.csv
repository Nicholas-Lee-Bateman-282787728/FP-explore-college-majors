3044782,2,B00102F5XO,"The video is not what one would call a lecture by any means.  It was filmed in a church, which is not an issue, and features a man who comes across as intentionally ignorant of the subject matter.  For instance, he makes the claim that Rome is not on seven hills despite the fact that it is (an almost universally acknowledged fact).  They are hills and not mountains, a distinction he is oblivious to.  He does that to ""prove"" his assertion that Rome/Roman Catholicism is not the Harlot spoken of in Revelation 17 and 18.  Don't get me wrong, I agree with that statement.  Roman Catholicism is not Babylon.  However, his argumentation is in need of a lot of help.  He also goes to great lengths to ignore an oft cited characteristic of Babylon; the fact that it is an actual city.  The angel makes this quite clear.  There can be some good arguments that would still sustain his premise, but he doesn't appeal to them.  And while an initial inclination may be to say that he is making sense, as there are certain connections that can be made, a closer look reveals that is not exactly the case.  Watch only if you're bored and/or looking for an elementary introduction into some of the other views on the identity of the city of Babylon as described in the book of Revelation.",1365206400,2,1277,4.48051948051948

Most who disagree have had their ""ox gored"" by the fact that the free_masons affect all religions. SO EITHER THE DETRACTORS ARE Masons or Mormans.
Joseph Smith was a mason, and a treasure hunter, and his mother was into the occult.
So even mormanism is masonic.
From the level of gods they worship to the magic underwear to ward off lucifer.

So we are infected.
JESUS SAID IT WOULD BE SO!
I have been aware of the Masonic Washington D.C., because my husband worked below their ""holy temple"" in alexadria va.... and the men who went there to worship, that were big in the city of alexandria government, used to try and convert my husband.
He resisted because of a book I gave him showing the occult leanings of the masons etc.
(Strange their temple  IS in Alexandria Va.)
FRANKLY I am reading everything I can to find out what is going on as churches are denying Jesus to fit in.

The gospel was penned by men and is essentially opinion, and opinion is something that all men will have. Had the Reverend Klein changed his oft repeated 'perversion' to 'evolved from' or 'evolved to' it would have changed the entire piece to one of remarkable enlightenment.
