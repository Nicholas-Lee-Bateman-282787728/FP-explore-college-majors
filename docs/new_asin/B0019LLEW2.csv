3438685,5,B0019LLEW2,"We visited the Mayan city of Tikal last winter.  Our guide recommended the book ""Cracking the Maya Code"" by Michael Coe.  I bought it and have worked at it, but it's a difficult book.  This documentary tells the story, with well chosen, picture-is-worth-a-thousand-words footage, and illuminating interviews with the living principals, including Michael Coe.

I had little appreciation for the Mayas, and confused them with the Aztecs, before I visited Tikal.  I learned that, at its peak in 800 AD, their civilization was more advanced than Europe's.  It collapsed, probably due to exceeding its environmental limits.  This movie, directed toward understanding its written language, also documents Mayan accomplishments in astronomy and culture.  It is accessible and engaging and explains some of the difficulties and the dramatic breakthroughs.

This may not make sense for the story of an intellectual achievement, but the story is so well told that, at times, it is so thrilling that I had to suppress a cheer.",1310515200,2,1015,5.29375
3438686,5,B0019LLEW2,"This information story documents the wonderful journey in decoding Maya writings in pictures.  Maya culture was well developed and established long before Columbus made to the American shore.

The Spanish came in burning the codex and killing priests knowledgeable in the writings. Why they did that to them?  There were only 4 survival codex in different countries.  This program shows the endeavor of a group of devoted people, scholars and a 18-year-young boy in breaking and understanding the rich culture of Maya, an invaluable American treasure.

With the codes, reader finds meaning and secret of the stone hieroglyphs in their history context in kings and queens, mythic heroes, cosmology.  It is wonderful to learn this discovery in a plain non-technical explanation in about an hour.  It is a miracle to bring history alive in learning and appreciating.",1300665600,2,863,5.255474452554744
3438687,3,B0019LLEW2,Very thorough explanation of Maya writing.  Not a video I would use with younger students studying Mayan culture.,1266796800,2,113,5.277777777777778
3438688,5,B0019LLEW2,"In the jungles of the Yucatan peninsula there was once a great empire.  They grew in power and knowledge far beyond what many would expect of people centuries ago, creating lunar and solar calendars as well as detailed astronomy records.  As a result of their isolated existence, they developed a unique system of hieroglyphs, iconography, and a system of written word that is just as complex, if not moreso, than many contemporary languages.  The difficulty for archaeologists, anthropologists, epigraphers, and linguists, however, was determing whether or not it was ancient writing or simply art; and then, if it was translatable.  Therein is the challenge faced by those who chose to take on the challenge of unlocking the secrets to the Mayan language, and possibly their mysterious culture.

When the ignorant religious fanaticism associated with the Spanish Inquisition decimated the Mayan civilization, and destroyed the majority of their historical texts, much of what was Mayan was lost.  Combine that with their culture's mysterious abandonment in 9th century, followed by the great but dormant cities being swallowed by the jungle, and the puzzle's difficulty increases exponentially.

Nearly 1,000 years later, Spanish explorers found the towers and cities, and soon the difficult task of translating the Maya code began.  Early breakthroughs as the result of a French artist's renditions of the inscriptions uncovered yet another deciphering difficulty: the problems of preconceived biases affecting translation.  Even the most trusted Mayan heiroglyphic scholar was completely wrong in his presumptions for several years.  I found it amazing how something considered to be the unequivocal truth could be turned on its head when new blood and new eyes bring about fresh perspectives, which happened when young minds questioned the status quo.

The difficult task got much ""easier"" when several books were found, one of which being the Dresden Codex, which contained important discoveries.  However, it is nonetheless sad that the Maya have had to hold on to their cultural heritage with such difficulty because of the dearth of written legacy.  Luckily, great effort has brought about change, and secrets have been uncovered that have unlocked the Maya code.

As a fan of linguistics, cryptography, and history, I found this documentary superb and incredibly compelling.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is even remotely interested.",1215993600,26,2450,5.444444444444445
3438689,5,B0019LLEW2,"There are many documentaries in which we humans pat ourselves on the backs for erecting edifices.  The same is true for eradicating infectious diseases.  However, besides the work on the Rosetta Stone, I can't think of any documentary that looks at learning ancient writing.  Thus, I appreciate this contribution.

Just like the Rosetta Stone documentary, polyglots and those of us who want to be polyglots will love this work.  Just like great individuals figured out Ancient Egyptian, this work lists the great individuals who cracked ancient Maya.  The Rosetta Stone worked with the familiar and became more abstract.  Modern people knew Greek and that's how they moved on to know demotic and hieroglyphs.  Here, it's not like an object had Spanish and then Romanized Mayan and then Ancient Mayan.  The code crackers lacked that type of aid.  Still, the work never states whether the code crackers had to learn spoken Mayan from living Mayans in order to move forward.

The documentary is diverse in that you see men and women, Americans and Russians, and even the young and the old.  The filmed interviews of deceased persons were done so well that they had to write that the persons were deceased.  Otherwise, I am sure that viewers would watch this and think that they could e-mail those people.  I must say that most anthropological works interview Western and indigenous scholars.  This work concludes with saying that living Mayan could now teach some of the writing to their children.  However, it would have been nice if some actual Mayan scholars or experts could have had some input here.

The work points to something important: how scholars are not always objective and how they bring their baggage with them.  For example, one researcher in the 1800s assumed that some words had drawings of elephants in them, thus reflecting the idea that the Mayans were related to Asian Indians, but that is not the case, just his misinterpretation.  The work said one scholar of Maya was a World War I vet so he liked spreading the idea that Mayans were peaceful people who just watched and recorded the stars.  The work later shows many drawings that present warfare, murder, and masochism.  This reminds me of how some says that Margaret Mead's work on Samoa was tainted by her desire to show at all costs that some cultures have sexually liberated young women.

This might be a great documentary to show at schools with many Mexican-American students.  Viewers who liked the cartoon ""The Road to El Dorado"" may really like seeing this as well.",1214956800,14,2549,4.89044289044289

8274386,5,B0019LLEW2,"Growing up, I was fascinated by ancient civilizations -- Rome, Assyria, Egypt, Greece, and the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans.  Forty years ago, the Mayan writing system was still largely a mystery to everyone, archaeologists included.  Since then, thanks to brilliant work both in getting new samples to study and in analyzing what was available, the ancient Mayans have become far more visible.  This DVD is about a century of discovery and the dedicated men and women who illuminated the script of the ancient Mayans.  Rich with photos,interviews, animations, and re-creations of critical events, even a non-archaeologist like me could follow the steps taken to link a complex script to its underlying meaning.  I'd recommend this DVD to anyone who has an interest in languages, archaeology, or Central America.",1358553600,,809,5.2890625
