2807502,3,B000P296EE,This movie was OK I was just expecting more from Wood Harris he is a good actore and it just let me down.,1213660800,,105,3.608695652173913
2807503,1,B000P296EE,"I really wish i had took the time to watch this before i spent $14.99 on this crap. There was no story whatsoever (if it was i didn't understand it), the acting was garbage, everything about it was garbage. This is not even a good bad movie (Dolemite, Plan 9 From Outer Space). I would have thought that with Wood Harris in this that it would have been at least somewhat watchable, but nope. Just a terrible waste of talent & time.",1189296000,2,431,4.2682926829268295
2807504,1,B000P296EE,"I usually don't do rewiews but I had to on this movie. I was very disappointed and was very glad that I did not purchase it. If you did not read the book, you will not know what is going on in the movie! Acting was bad, sound quality was awful! It was just plain awful, please do yourself a favor and pass on the movie, but do pick up the book!",1189123200,2,344,3.7916666666666665
2807505,3,B000P296EE,"I do like Elise and Wood as actors but this could have been a BET movie or an episode of the Wire.. The whole story line we've seen before and I predicted almost everything that happened, but like I said I love them both as actors and will add it to my african american movie collection.",1188950400,,287,4.142857142857143
2807506,1,B000P296EE,"I live in Baltimore and I thought this movie was bad.
The acting sucked and story wasn't good at all.",1188432000,2,101,4.1
2807507,5,B000P296EE,I must say if you are a writer and can have a book that is so good go to film you are doing the damn thing. This a movie that is based on the book Thug Life by Thomas Long. In this movie you are able to connect to the characters of the book. I really enjoy seeing Wood Harris and Elise Neal in this movie because they are both well know actors. The only thing I hate is the way that the book ended. I thought it would saw them living happily. But the book was the bomb and so was the movie...,1185840000,4,492,3.7403846153846154
2807508,1,B000P296EE,"I try to support independent urban films. Most are surpisingly very good. But this has to be the worst of the worst. The plot if you can call it that does come together at all. This movie is really all over the place and you are left to draw your own conclusion A LOT. Many times in the movie I found myself wondering what in the world does this have to do with the movie. Ie. When Jaretha (Elise Neal) was rolling around on the bed looking like she was going through with drawls after Dayvon rescued her from her abusive ex Malik. The person I watched the movie with read Thug Life by Thomas Long thats its based on. He said there is alot to the story that is either left out or just skimmed over. Like the ex (Malik) beats her up, gets her hooked on heroin and turns her into a hooker. You'd never know any of that watching the movie. You'd be like me wondering why she is rolling around on the bed like a fool. Honestly it's like a broke down low LOW budget episode of the Wire, the location is W B-more just like the Wire and with the two of main characters I might add. (Wood Harris who name in this movie Dayvon, in the Wire its Avon...what a far stretch lol and Ed Williams who is Boodie in the Wire) Also is it just me or does it look like for the majority of the movie he is standing on the same corner he was hustling on in the Wire. Any ways I've said it before and I'll say it again. Time is something you can waste, but never get back. This movie is a major waste of time.",1185753600,4,1485,4.0033670033670035

8188396,1,B000P296EE,"I'm extremely disappointed because Wood Harris and Elise Neal are two of my favorite actors.  This was easily the worst performances of either of their careers, and a horrible movie to boot.  The story reminded me of one of those ""smut book"" by one of the many ""fly by night"" so called authors that seem to be popping up all over Baltimore.  The acting was terrible, the story was terrible, cinematography terrible, soundtrack terrible, camera work terrible in fact the only thing that was good about the movie was Gina's beautiful eyes and smile when she opened the door for Dayvon.",1349568000,,583,4.752475247524752
8188397,1,B000P296EE,"I just watched this movie on Netflix. Even though I watched it for free, I still feel robbed. Robbed of an hour and a half of my life that I will NEVER get back. Some of the acting was bearable at best, and the plot was all over the place. What made it so confusing for me was that there were so many different characters introduced during the movie, but I couldn't quite catch how all of them were connected to one another. I had to keep asking myself, ""who is this person, again?"" and ""what do they have to do with the plot?"" I could have watched one of those old school blaxploitation movies and would have been more entertained than I was while watching this... :(",1334361600,,668,4.2265625
