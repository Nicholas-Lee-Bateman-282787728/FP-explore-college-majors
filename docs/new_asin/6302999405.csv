7834605,3,6302999405,"This video is a collection of highlights from the first 9 wrestlemanias. This video was released back in 1994. Even though there's a lot of stuff to be seen on this video, The mere fact that many of these highlights don't last no more than about maybe 3 minutes is enough to make the quality of this video go down. On this video, We see clips of classic wrestlemania matches like Randy Savage Vs. Ricky Steamboat, Hulk Hogan Vs. Andre The Giant, Hulk Hogan vs. The Ultimate Warrior, And many more. This video is good if you only wanna see what the earlier years of wrestlemania were like. But, If you want a much better experience of the earlier wrestlemanias [Or any wrestlemania in general], It's still best to see the wrestlemanias in their entirety. Though this is a collection of wrestlemania highlights, It's sad that we don't even get to see the endings to some good matches. There's some good matches like The Rockers Vs. The barbarian and Haku that don't even play for more than about a minute and that match right there we don't even get to see who won that match! And, There's a match from wrestlemania 9 on here that features The Steiner Brothers that doesn't even get played for more than 10 seconds! It's little foolish stuff like that that brings the quality of this video down. If this tape showed some longer highlights of these matches, This tape would be an ideal viewing experience for every Wwe fan out there even if it does pre-date every wrestlemania past 9! This and all the old Wwe tapes that were released from coliseum video are now out of print. But, This tape was re-released through Wwe home video for dvd and it's now available again on dvd for about $5-$10. Even though this tape has clips of some classic matches, I would still reccomend that Wwe fans buy the 4 volumes of the wrestlemania box set or if you do have the money it takes, Buy the entire wrestlemania box set that the Wwe released about a month ago. That way, You'll have every wrestlemania you want.",1133740800,,1996,4.516574585635359
