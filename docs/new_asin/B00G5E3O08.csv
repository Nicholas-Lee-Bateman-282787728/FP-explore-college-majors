8620890,5,B00G5E3O08,"Great workout for advanced exercisers, though other levels could do it with modifications.

It's broken up into 8 blocks. Each block starts with three rounds of 40-second, Tabata-style exercises with 20-second rests between each. Plus, each 40-second burst is a different move which is nice. No repetition. Then there are two-minutes of compound weight exercises (I use 12# dumbbells and 8# for a few moves). Finally there's a one-minute round of abs/core. Every block is different, so again, there is no repetition which keeps the workout from getting dull. Plus, the instructor's enthusiasm is fun. When he says, ""holy guacamole,"" he's not kidding. Great workout, just like his others.",1433548800,,687,5.302752293577981
8620891,5,B00G5E3O08,"This workout is awesome! It's long but it contains blocks so easy to shorten. I love him. Wish he would come out with more dvds! The cardio portions are hard. All high impact. Strength training also hard and gets heart rate way up. Each block has ab work, and the ab work is very good.",1414454400,,285,4.2
8620892,5,B00G5E3O08,A well organized workout that will work every muscle in your body. It's set up in 8 blocks--in each block you'll do three cardio drills for 40 seconds each with 20 seconds of rest in between. Then 2 minutes with weights--the weight drill will increase in difficulty every 30 seconds. The last part of the block is a minute of core work. You will tone up and lose fat doing this work out.,1405468800,3,387,4.315068493150685
8620893,4,B00G5E3O08,"I consider myself at an intermediate-advanced level of fitness.

Uses mat, high step, free weights.

Pros:  Decent production values for film quality, sound, and location (I have seen better and I have seen worse.)  Camera angles are good (no unnecessary ab closeups with no idea what move is being done.)  Instructor is pleasant, gives decent cues, does not do excessive pep-filler talk.  Backup folks non-annoying.  Music has a beat, no singer, and does not interfere with instructor cues (there is an option for no music if preferable.)  Moves are simple but effective and rotates so you get cardio, weights, and abs in rounds.  A timer shows on screen and motivates you to hold out knowing the interval end is near.  There is some up and down with ab moves usually being on the ground but at least is not a constant up-down-up-down which is usually a little annoying for me.  I sweated a lot and felt I got an intense workout --- instructor is also shown dripping sweat like crazy so if that kind of thing bothers you this may not be for you.

Cons:  Hour long workout and no options for chapters or timesaver mix so if you want to break it down you have to do it yourself.",1390435200,3,1177,4.5476190476190474
