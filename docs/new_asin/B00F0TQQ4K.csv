8611211,2,B00F0TQQ4K,"The sound and picture quality on this DVD was mediocre at best. There is no menu, there is no navigation except pause. You can find much better quality performances of both pieces on other releases. Try Michael Tilson Thomas Tchaikovsky 4th Symphony on DVD and Barenboim's 70th birthday concert for Tchaikovsky's 1st piano.
Dennis Matsuev did an admirable job, but suffered from under sized and under skilled Ensemble accompaniment.",1520899200,,432,5.27536231884058
