Glory Days was quirky, creepy, funny and most of all ENTERTAINING! I highly recommend this show and really do hope that I can buy it soon.",1293580800,,308,4.421052631578948
7940978,5,B00005JO2F,"Ah, yet another gem that lasted for an oh-so-brief nine episodes before the WB realized they had something brilliant and watchable (unlike most of the trash that litters that network) and promptly cancelled it.
Glory Days told the story of Mike Dolan, a mystery writer whose sole bestseller was inspired by his own father's mysterious death years before. When a cryptic note brings Mike back to Glory, the small island Pacific Northwest island town where he grew up, he finds he's alienated almost the entire town in the process of writing his book; his mother and older sister are upset at being portrayed as neurotic control freaks, his best friend (and local sheriff) Rudy is miffed that his character comes across as the village idiot (and a repressed homosexual), and local diner-owner, Hazel, is understandably annoyed at being cast as the murderer in Mike's book (especially considering her real-life affair with his father). The only person he hasn't offended is the town's new coroner, Ellie Sparks, and his teenage sister Sam.
But all is not well in Glory; week after week, Mike, Ellie and Rudy find themselves trying to solve bizarre crimes, all while Mike tries to discover the truth about his father's death.",1222128000,4,1221,4.990196078431373

7940980,5,B00005JO2F,"This was an awesome show.  It centered around an island that a troubled youth had left, moved to New York, published a book, came home and all the townspeople hated him for writing the book.  Apparently the book slung mud at several citizens.  All these odd mysteries keep coming up and an awful lot of murders for such a small community. All the small town vibe with lots of intrique.

The show was interesting and pretty much an edge of your seat type thriller.  It is available in England in PAL format under the title DEMONTOWN.

I remember it used to say on the ad: Welcome to Glory -population dwindling.",1115683200,8,610,4.5
