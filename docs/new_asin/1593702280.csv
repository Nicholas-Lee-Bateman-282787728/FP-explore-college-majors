7799661,5,1593702280,I am an electrical/instrumentation tech and though I have worked quite some time in the oil industry I just recently started full time in a refinery. I have the previous version of the companion book and it is great as well. To me however there is nothing as good as animated graphics with explanations. This covers almost all of the basic processes you will find in a refinery. I have learned quite a bit from it already and am going through the videos for the second time. It will probably take several times through the series along with my day to day experience to get the most out of it. Cost is a bit prohibitive but if you are working in the industry it is a worthy investment. Knowledge is power and the key to advancement.,1376352000,2,731,4.382352941176471
