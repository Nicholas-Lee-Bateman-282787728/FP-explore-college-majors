2744946,3,B000MRNWME,"The main reason for owning this movie is if you like Dennis Hopper and want to have a collection of movies he has starred in. That's why I was willing to take a look at it in the first place. Given the cover and lack of info. (such as what aspect ratio) I suspected nothing better than a ""B"" movie.  That it is.

In its defense, I think critique criteria has become somewhat warped with special effects driven suspense and drama. That, this move doesn't have.  What it does have is dialogue that, though lacking in some ways, is believable in many of the settings where they occur.

Flaws? Sure.  But if you like Dennis Hopper his acting isn't bad. The film overall is lacking.  So his performance gets dragged along with it.  The character he plays doesn't call for a range of emotions.

Finally, the transfer, as mentioned by others is surely from a VHS tape.  At one point the colors change in a scrolling fashion across the screen as you would see in a VHS tape.

All in all, I consider it worth having.  Not because it is a great movie; because It's part of Dennis Hopper's filmography.",1342396800,2,1091,4.405
2744947,2,B000MRNWME,"Dennis Hopper's THE INSIDE MAN (aka ""Slagskmpen"") is not to be confused with Spike Lee's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/INSIDE-MAN/dp/B000GFLKF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">INSIDE MAN</a>&nbsp;(2006).

This Cold War spy flick is a joint Swedish-British production done in English. It's based on a Swedish best seller about an actual incident: a Soviet sub that's found lurking in Swedish waters by a modified laser.

Here, the laboratory that develops a usable submarine tracking laser is torched and the device stolen. An agent (Ekman) of the Swedish equivalent of the FBI suspects scientist Paul Mandell (Krger) of the arson/theft, so he plants an operative (Molder) as Mandell's driver. Hopper is a U.S. government official trying to reacquire the laser before the Russians get ahold of it.

Even diehard Dennis fans may find it difficult to sit through this one, and for those who fondly recall Krger's turn as the model airplane designer who rescues Jimmy Stewart and several other stranded crash victims in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-FLIGHT-OF-THE-PHOENIX/dp/B00008MTVZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX</a>&nbsp;(1965), you may wonder where his fine acting skills disappeared to.

A real disappointment.

(4.4) The Inside Man (Sweden/UK-1984) - Dennis Hopper/Hardy Krger/Gsta Ekman/Kre Mlder/David Wilson",1266969600,3,1499,6.507537688442211
2744948,2,B000MRNWME,"I agree with most of the other reviewers on this one.  This is a dreadful, dreary awful movie. With Dennis Hopper in it, I was hoping for more than a B movie.  The story line is a good one, a true story about a Russian submarine able to sneak into Norwegian waters.  The acting is poor, the characters are predictable.  The action star even drives a Trans Am (in Norway non the less).  If you like submarine movies, there is about 30 seconds of submarine time in the whole movie.  Even the Michael Dudikoff sub movies are better than this one. :)",1253923200,4,546,4.303921568627451

2744950,2,B000MRNWME,"The movie was satisfactory as far as the plot.  The DVD was terrible in the transfer.  I've had this movie about six months and have attempted to watch it many times, but never got past the first 15 minutes due to the poor quality of sound and picture.  I finally watched it completely and only give it 2 stars for the basic plot which was only satisfactory.",1170979200,2,358,4.313432835820896
2744951,2,B000MRNWME,"This film, set and filmed in Sweden, had the potentials to be a good cold war thriller. After all, they have some good actors, like Dennis Hopper. Unfortunately, the story is not that great and the pace is slow. It's not an awful movie but it's also not as entertaining as it could have been. Nice to see Gsta Ekman and Dennis Hopper together, and Lena Endre, who has since become one of Sweden's most famous actresses, made her film debut in this one.

The movie is something of a curiousity piece and even though I didn't think it was very good, I'm glad I have seen it, and there are cheap DVD editions, so if you're curious about it, go ahead and spend five or six dollars on it, but don't expect too much.",1156291200,3,710,4.2592592592592595
2744952,2,B000MRNWME,As we used to say in the submarine service . . . you get a double punch on your Hurter Card for sitting through this.  How did they get Dennis Hopper to sign on for this one?  It looks like it was filmed with a camcorder.  During the semi-nude scenes I found myself looking for holes in their underwear.  I'll give it 2 stars since it was in color and had sound.,1134518400,,362,3.986111111111111

2745039,1,B000MRNWME,"The story is based on a true incident from 1981.  As a former veteran of the U.S. Submarine Service I was looking forward to see how this movie was produced. I thought it would be a good movie with a star like Dennis Hopper starring.  I was so very wrong on all aspects.  I could only handle about 5 minutes of this movie.  Besides it being filmed in the old square 4:3 aspect ratio and standard definition (not even standard digital), the dialog was horrendous and the acting had a lot to be desired. If you want to watch a really good submarine movie watch Das Boot.",1463097600,2,568,4.280373831775701

The story revolves around a device that is USED on subs, but this is just a terrible Swedish/American spy thriller.  Everything about this movie sucks.  The score is retro '80s electronica (and not in a good way), the acting is HORRIBLE (yes, even from Dennis Hopper), there is unnecessary (male) full frontal nudity and the story is CRAP.  Plus, the fistfights are laughable, the Swedish characters speak with British accents and the cliches just never stop.  Wow!  This is awful!  Stay away!",1439424000,3,566,5.021505376344086

8171436,2,B000MRNWME,"I was hopeful that with Dennis Hopper this movie would be good, but no. Hopper has done so many great movies from Easy Rider, to Blue Velvet and beyond. I like most of his work but he does not overcome the weaknesses of this movie. It's not all bad but I feel the setup is for a submarine movie and we get a movie about a search for a secret agent mole. Hopper isn't the central character - the agent searching for the mole is played by Gosta Ekman (as Stig Larsson).

If you were hoping for a submarine movie (as in you see submarines) you need only watch the first 8 minutes. The rest is low action search for the ""inside man"". This is not an action movie by any reasonable measure.

I did watch it all the way though, but it barely kept my attention. Just not my kind of movie. If you like slow-moving puzzle solving movies this might be good for you. There are lots of other movies of this type done better and. ""Ice Station Zebra"" with  Rock Hudson, Patrick McGoohan, and Ernest Borgnine comes to mind as a very well done example of genre.

In conclusion this would be 3 stars if it were ho-hum, but I feel it also misrepresents the type of movie in the opening sequences. Because it kept me watching till the end it's not 1 star. That leaves 2 stars. With Dennis Hopper I'd hoped for more.",1500854400,,1295,4.209677419354839
