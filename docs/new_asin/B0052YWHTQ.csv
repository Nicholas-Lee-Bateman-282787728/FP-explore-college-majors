4532822,5,B0052YWHTQ,Hope the American version is as good as this one it was really great from the teenage point of view. But really if the kids today honestly act like this we are totally screwed.,1309392000,4,176,4.205882352941177
4532823,5,B0052YWHTQ,Great Movie! Mother and Daughter goals.,1525305600,,39,5.666666666666667
4532824,5,B0052YWHTQ,Loved the realisticness of this movie! Demi and Miley are both great.,1525046400,,69,4.833333333333333
4532825,5,B0052YWHTQ,this was a great movie. i loved it.,1524700800,,35,3.5
4532826,5,B0052YWHTQ,"I thought I'd hate this movie like most millenial movies (no offense mills) that I watch.  To my dismay, I absolutely loved this movie titled LOL (Lots of Love)!  Of course, I related to Demi Moore's character & her peers! ...Wee",1524700800,,229,4.560975609756097
4532827,5,B0052YWHTQ,What a nice movie! Joy to watch,1524700800,,31,3.5714285714285716
4532828,4,B0052YWHTQ,"cheerful romantic stories for mother and daughter in Chicago.  Typical Wholly Weird pretense that the socially destructive toxin Marriage You Wanna is harmful only to the users, but in this film without disrupting the cheerful story lines.",1524355200,,239,5.45945945945946
4532829,5,B0052YWHTQ,loved it!,1524355200,,9,4.0
4532830,2,B0052YWHTQ,Bland rambling plot.  I felt no connection to any of the characters in this movie and the mother-daughter relationship wasn't all that convincing.,1523923200,,146,5.3478260869565215
4532831,2,B0052YWHTQ,"What was the point of this movie? There was no turning point. Every conflict that the characters came to was resolved without them doing anything about it. Lol gets mad at her boyfriend, without talking it out, they are in love again. Mother and daughter get into a huge fight, then again without any resolution they are not mad at each other again. I feel like this was probably the directorial debut of the son of some big shot Hollywood director who had a lot of money to make and promote the movie. Absolutely no substance.",1523664000,6,527,4.5
4532832,5,B0052YWHTQ,I liked it. Lots of bad comments about it so i guess Im the minority in this.  The tunes are stuck in my head from this films as well,1523664000,,133,3.586206896551724
4532833,4,B0052YWHTQ,Just fun to watch it's not that bad nor that great it just reminds me my teen years,1523664000,,83,3.6666666666666665
4532834,1,B0052YWHTQ,What is this? I love you Demi but Why are you appearing in this trash Demi? This saddens me. Are you this desperate for a role :( you are so much better than this movie.,1523577600,,169,3.857142857142857
4532835,1,B0052YWHTQ,"awful, horrible acting, as suspected",1523491200,,36,6.4
4532836,3,B0052YWHTQ,I'm not sure what I was thinking or where I was when this came out in 2012. I hadn't heard of it so decided to give it a try. Meh. It's pretty mediocre. I guess the best part was seeing that Demi Moore just never ages. Seriously! lol.,1523491200,,234,3.8958333333333335
4532837,1,B0052YWHTQ,"This is a terrible terrible movie. Within 30 min, I realized that there is no direction or plot for this movie. I quit watching it. Miley Cyrus is a terrible actress.",1523404800,,166,4.387096774193548
4532838,4,B0052YWHTQ,Wasn't expecting this movie to captivate me yet it had its ways. I enjoyed the dynamic between family it displays.,1523318400,2,114,4.75
4532839,1,B0052YWHTQ,I couldn't even finish it,1523232000,,25,4.2
4532840,4,B0052YWHTQ,"Clicked on this movie, curious about Demi and Miley, haven't seen much of them in recent years really. But both of them are just as beautiful as ever, very engaging actors. The movie was not a deeply moving one, more as a lighthearted and casually interesting plot. Marlo Thomas was a pleasant surprise, and an inspiration to every woman alive, to look as wonderful as she does as she has gotten older. The beauty of these three women, in three different stages of life, was really wonderful to see. As well as their talent on the screen, making every moment of the movie enjoyable and pleasant. I've seen some bad reviews, about ""parenting"", and ""good examples"". But hey, it's a movie. Overall, it was a good watch if you like Demi, Miley, or Marlo.  I like all three of them, and I liked the movie.",1523145600,,800,4.517241379310345
4532841,2,B0052YWHTQ,Not sure why I watched it to the end.,1523145600,,37,3.2222222222222223
4532842,1,B0052YWHTQ,"certainly expected more from Miley, and Demi. If ever there was a movie that the actors did not give their all- this is it.",1523059200,,123,4.166666666666667
4532843,2,B0052YWHTQ,"This is so light and fluffy that it becomes hard for this film to even drive the point home, whatever the point of this was. They didn't spend enough time developing the relationships between characters. My thinking is that you should want to care about Lola or her mom or anybody, instead after about 30 minutes you wind up thinking about why you even chose this in the first place and that perhaps you should be getting ready to start your day. It did have the potential to be a cool teen drama, in the very beginning. I like the narration by the character, in the opening minutes because it makes you think this is going somewhere AAAAANNNNNDDDD then you realize you've just wasted 45 mins hoping that things will get better. The two stars are for the acting, which i felt was pretty good given the set up of the story. Also mucho unrealistic in terms of the real world, but whatever... you got me LOL...won't happen again.",1523059200,,926,4.485207100591716
4532844,1,B0052YWHTQ,"Perfect portrayal of dysfunctional family.  A real disgrace!  Lack of any morals, honesty and integrity.  Its no wonder today's kids are so messed up.",1523059200,,150,5.166666666666667
4532845,1,B0052YWHTQ,"am pretty sure MC was an actress on some Disney channel show or something like that years ago... Experience like that should make you a pretty good actress right?  Hardly the case, she's awful. Horrible script with name actors and decent lighting make for an absolute bore if you're 12 years old...outright ridiculous scenes make this one of the worst movies every made for teens... absolute trash.",1522972800,,398,4.940298507462686

4532848,4,B0052YWHTQ,"With 4 girls, this movie nearly drove me nuts. But I was a teen in high school before so I know what goes on. Demi Moore is stuck in time, she never ages?! So beautiful. And the cop in the movie was fine! They picked a good one for her hook-up! For strict parents pre-screen the movie before allowing pre-teens or teens watch. There were no morals at the end but it does give the opportunity for conversation.",1522540800,2,409,4.256410256410256
4532849,5,B0052YWHTQ,Really good. Very relatable.,1522454400,,28,6.25
4532850,1,B0052YWHTQ,"It's 2018!! Empowering women?!? Epic fail... I am 60. I have always been independent and did what I want when I want. I have never been oppressed.... I  learned from my grandmother, that I can be anything, if I really want to... I learned from my father, that I am equal to a man in the workforce... that was 55 years ago!! ... I learned from my husband to stand up for myself and do not let anyone use or bully me.... That was 20 years ago.... There are more and more good movies that DO NOT try to brainwash women and men into believing, that for a woman to ""be in charge of my own life"" they have to wear uncomfortable, expensive clothes and underwear that is sexually pleasing to men.... have sex, take drugs, and drink alcohol as a young teen... and obsess about men all the time.... Hello Hollywood: Women have brains, too, not just boobs and vaginas....",1522454400,,860,4.341614906832298
4532851,1,B0052YWHTQ,it's hard to give a damn about them. And Demi Moore's character offers a classic example of bad parenting.,1522195200,4,106,4.631578947368421

4532856,5,B0052YWHTQ,"I loved this movie. I loved the relationship between mom and daughter. Real life. I am going to be in that situation soon. My son is twelve but we have a similar relationship, so I identify myself in Demi Moores character. Demi moore was FABULOUS. Love all the cast. I don't have anything negative to say.

4532859,5,B0052YWHTQ,"Highly entertaining.  Nice clean movie, no blood or sex, and no cuss words.  Thought it was pretty realistic of todays world.

The adults get as much screen time as the kids too.  The last half hour when the kids go to France, lol for days.
Side note; Demi Moore is ageless.  Either she sold her soul, or she has an excellent cosmetic surgeon.",1521158400,,343,4.380952380952381

Get over your hatred for Miley, she is a good actor and a fantastic person. Yeah, she's crazy, but she works it (maybe not elegantly, but there isn't a rulebook anywhere about it). The whole cast envelopes you into their world to make you feel like you are there.

There are much more fun bad movies to watch. I'd imagine, if you had this on Blu-Ray (and I'm definitely not encouraging you to buy it), the 1.5x function might make it a little more tolerable. If you're watching this as a bad movie, I'd say, just watch it until it starts dragging for you, then skip to when they go to France, then stop whenever it gets intolerable for you.",1425686400,,591,4.422018348623853

4532952,1,B0052YWHTQ,"I only rented this movie because of Paul Sheer's ""How Did This Get Made?"" podcast, and I can't wait to hear them pick over this worthless excuse for a movie.  I constantly felt like I was watching some sort of Nickelodeon/Disney hybrid show that got picked up by FX or AMC, a tweeny-bopper movie with the sex and drugs stuff added in there.  I wasn't expecting much from Miley Cyrus and her ""friends"" in the movie, but was very disappointed in all the adult characters in the film (I'm talking to you Demi Moore, Thomas Jane, and Marlo Thomas).  It seemed no one wanted to be an adult and act their age!  Plus with all the misogynistic elements (young girl practically eye rapes her teacher every chance she gets) and demeaning of girls and women in the story, I was very surprised to learn that this was written and directed by a woman.  Now I hear that the French version of this film is very good, and was acclaimed and considered for awards. But if it's the same plot as this stinker, I'm afraid that I'll have to pass on that one.

To summarize, this movie is dumb and you can find a better way to spend 111 minutes of your time.",1416182400,5,1134,4.3254716981132075

Demi Moore as her mom seems very authentic and takes her place out of the spotlight gracefully. The teen group are believable and the adult characters are actually pretty funny. Douglas Booth is well-cast as the friend that becomes the boyfriend who is incidentally gorgeous and a talented musician too.

4533006,4,B0052YWHTQ,This was a very refreshing story. Although some parents would love to have this type of relationship with there kids.,1403740800,,117,4.9
4533007,2,B0052YWHTQ,"Was this movie terrible? No. I don't feel like it riotously earned so many 1 star votes. Obviously people haven't seen truly terrible productions. You have to go into this movie expecting it to be a bit of a risqu&eacute; teen chick-flick featuring none other than the infamous Miley Cyrus. I'm guessing this was Miley Cyrus's attempt at transitioning from Hannah Montana to a grown girl. It's a well-played move on her part to take this role. As it wasn't too 'adult', but definitely separated her from her sweet innocent image. Obviously, since this movie was made she's made an avid attempt at recreating herself. But during the time when this movie was made, I'm assuming the ENTIRE purpose of it was to bring Miley from little girl to grown teen woman in the eyes of the public. Did it work? I don't know.

Miley's acting tends to follow her spirited personality in Hannah Montana. In this film you see a few serious scenes from her, but nothing that's going to really 'wow' you as a viewer and make you think she's definitely ready for more mature roles. In the film she plays the teenage daughter of Demi Moore. Her mother is concerned about Miley's character Lola losing her virginity. All the while all Lola really cares about is dating a guy she actually cares about.

The film is... forgettable. I honestly watched it two months ago and am having trouble recalling enough of the film to write a thorough review. There was definitely nothing that stuck out as amazing or worthwhile. The storyline was predictable. The acting was mediocre. Nothing really shown brightly.

Ironically enough in the film Lola's mother (Demi) is a pot smoker? It's such a weird additive to the film. I don't understand the point of it at all. If the film was targeted towards teen girls, I'm guessing this was a way of showing that no matter how strict Lola's mother may seem she's actually ""cool"" because she smokes weed? I think having Demi's character smoke pot was a very sad attempt at making her seem relatable to the kids. I mean- I'm not necessarily 'anti marijuana' but would I want my teen daughter watching a film where the mother is smoking pot? Heck no. That's a ridiculous example of parenting. If some mom wants to go out with her friends and have a good time occasionally- fine. And I don't necessarily have anything against parents who responsibly smoke. But I sure as heck don't want my child thinking that pot-smoking parents are cool. Just like I don't want them thinking cigarette-smoking or drinking is cool. I was really offended to see that involved in the film at all. And I think a lot of other parents would be disappointed as well.

Overall, I don't know who'd I'd recommend this film for. Older teens 17 to 19 in age? It's a bit too 'young' for them. But it's a bit too maturely-written for anyone under 16. And most adults are bound to find it boring and stupidly scripted. I want to give this film more than 2 stars. But nothing made it magnificent. Is it a one star movie? No. It's not TERRIBLE. But it's certainly not memorable. It's barely decent. I like both Miley and Demi. But participation in this film was not one of their greatest choices.",1403481600,,3168,4.611702127659575

4533026,2,B0052YWHTQ,"Now I know why I've not heard of this movie. It was more of an after school special only not as good. The movie had no flow, it seemed forced. It was full of singular moments that seemed cut and pasted together to make a movie. The language the people used was inconsistent throughout, again making it feel cut and pasted. Where you would think it made since for cursing they did not, but for no reason they would toss out a few curse words that just made it feel dumb. This movie feels rushed and incomplete. To bad, this could have been worth your time to watch it.",1398816000,,567,4.2110091743119265

4533028,2,B0052YWHTQ,"Bored within the first ten minutes of watching it. Miley's character is so shallow and ""teenage"" that her actions can't even drive the story anywhere. She's like a twelve year old's definition of popular and it drives the plot (if there is one) straight into the ground with the incessant ""OMG"" style lines and boy-crazy antics.

Would not recommend to anyone except pre-tween girls at a bad sleepover.",1398643200,,402,4.911764705882353

4533033,1,B0052YWHTQ,I couldn't watch this movie past 10 minutes into it. Miley's character was absurdly hypocritical and the execution of this repulsive character was too painful to stomach watching a full movie of her. I definitely did not finish the movie.,1398038400,3,238,4.975
4533034,2,B0052YWHTQ,"some guarantees you will take from this movie:  miley is a horrible actress, scary bad. demi moore looks fantastic.  no one suffers like wealthy white beautiful teenagers. it was the longest 90 mins in film - dragging a body thru the woods is less stressful.",1397865600,,258,4.711111111111111

4533038,4,B0052YWHTQ,After reading the other reviews did not expect to like this. Yes some of the plot lines were a little far fetched but for the most part really accurate. No I don't think all teens behave this way but am positive more than 75% do. Go in with an open mind and you will be pleasantly surprised.,1397174400,,291,4.12280701754386

I know a lot of folks are not fans of Miley, but if you can get past that you will find that she did a great job in this movie. After a few minutes of watching I realized I'd already seen this movie when it first hit Redbox, but it still kept me interested enough to watch it again. If you enjoy the coming of age theme , you will find this movie entertaining and it might even tug a few heart strings.",1396742400,,519,3.814814814814815

4533045,3,B0052YWHTQ,"The film was not too bad but had a pretty generic feel to it. The plot line was not anything new, a pretty typical coming-of-age type of story, and the acting was not bad. You knew exactly where the story was headed within the first 5 minutes of the movie. Personally, I enjoy a movie that keeps me on my toes but LOL didn't really have much substance to it as there were no real lasting obstacles the characters had to overcome. Overall, the movie was okay for a free movie. I would not buy nor rent it.",1396137600,,504,4.153061224489796

4533070,1,B0052YWHTQ,depended on star power.  No story. Nothing interesting.  We can all enjoy better disagreements with our teens in real life. Perhaps a good lesson on lousy parenting.,1391472000,,165,5.074074074074074

4533075,1,B0052YWHTQ,"This movie was chock-full of what every teen thinks life is like, but it couldn't be any farther from the truth. It was like a slutty after school Disney channel show.
No teenager knows what real love is after getting drunk, smoking weed and sleeping around!

4533144,4,B0052YWHTQ,"I did not expect to like this movie.. at all.

I'm a married, young 24 year old mother of an 18 month old boy. I hated my teenage years, and I love my life now. Each day I thank God that i'm not in high school anymore! With that being said watching this movie I began to feel a sense of nostalgia about my high school days, and a part of me wished I knew then what I know now. This film also gave me a sense of comfort that me and my friends weren't the only ones who went through stuff like that.

 I mean no, i would not recommend that young girls lie, sleep with guys, drink, or smoke weed, BUT thats exactly what a lot of young girls are doing and have done, at some point in the past I was one of them. I could completely relate to Miley's character. I believed her character and the struggles she was going through because I went through some of them or had friends that did as well.

I think that the mother daughter relationship in this film is dynamic and honest. There are many occasions in which their openness with one another was depicted to the viewer as the GLUE that holds their family together and is also responsible for many obstacles along the way. Honesty and openness is what I believe is lacking in most parent child relationships, they force it out of one another. Partying, erratic, irresponsible behavior is what is typical of our young people. If you know anything about psychology you know that its almost not even their fault, it is a phase, and they will be better off for having some wild experiences. Were you never a teen? you never lied? lost your virginity? smoked? or drank? made decisions that you weren't proud of? found your self in situations that your choices put you in, and was mortified? YEAH RIGHT! Chill with the judgement, and focus on the positive message of this film and you will LOVE it. I plan to watch this film with my unborn teenage daughter, any opportunity to create a dialogue and have OPEN HONEST communication about what she is going through, and how real it is for her, I will take.  The acting was great, writing was better, and the character development phenomenal.

I love the truth in the film. Each character's truth is consistent with whats going on in homes all across america. Mom's who have their own struggles, trying to raise daughters, who think they can raise themselves but don't know how. We're all just trying to figure it out.",1380326400,2,2404,4.403153153153153

4533155,4,B0052YWHTQ,"Here we have a film..in which it really is a director's film..and she sais she has much $$ and adds a commentary and although many didn't appreciate the contours in which the film is shot its interesting to look at as a french filmmaker looks at a suburban mther daughter relationship and the issues there, and also with another group of adults with similar issues, like a control and regular group, who don't appear to be all that different, and then the daughter goes globetrotting away from the suburbs..to varying locales. I think at first viewing it is doubtful an american director, the makeup, the way its shot, scenes..that crossed my mind and the way the french scenes are shot that is more apparent? I enjoyed the film and the issues raised and the failure in a certain sense, is to accomodate two scene presences, demi moore and miley cyrus? DEmi i believe during the filming was in therapy or some problem..but her scenes here are fully realized..much more then in all her seductress roles, the reluctant amour, she seems more into this role..and miley must respond in her scenes with demi..which is an acting chore from her standpoint? The director here has to accomodate.and he has to showcase miley..and i believe she really wants to show the mother's side..and she really is constraine dsince she knows what her viewers expect..thats why casting often changes what you get, and the two actresses want the film and their presence to make it their film..i'm kidding and im glad on film sets this stuff doesnt go on..but it often goes into the writing and set ups? There is a film 9 to 5..here the action is geared to the nocturnal..the talk action drama..unlike the film 9 to 5..characters who live the whole day for whatever reason..the adolescent mind seems all pervasive..from just about every angle even the girls fight among lovers..and betray each other..this story of prolonged adolescent..the sleeping bear syndrome? the action picks up in detroit chicago and france//the models..beautifully photographed..will have everyone flocking from the world for parisienne fashions and lifestyle, to gawk and take a photo..wonderfully photographed and the american scenes on the subway..the early shot and the lifestyles don't match up..with the paris life or what life should be and transitions are shot throughout the film..did you find the scenes in a few places unsubtle..sometimes the director goes overboard especially with ascene in class with an apple..entertaining film, which tries to tell so much from miley cyrus..and her loves..and battles with men and women..post adolescent life..and demi moore the maternal star with 3 real kids i think, and she comes off real good as the mother, ..INdecent Proposal and Disclosure, such scenes are in the background here, also JUROR..here we have the maternal..the 9 to 5 persona..if not sunrise to sunset..and the different scenes, and the way this europen director sets them up...lift this film from the mundane? I recall a music video as a kid..""voulez vous coucher avec moi?""..i think out of Quebec which is different from quebec french...quebecois french..louisianna french..here we have parisienne french..and the scenes of france..the young and lifestyle...make us all want to flock as the youn gpersons pictures here..",1378166400,,3290,5.139925373134329

Stuff that could never happen to your child. But this is the real world. And this movie allows you to see it through a teenage girl's eyes. If your child is influenced by media, that isn't the media's fault. Media will never stop doing as it does. You just have to teach them what should influence them. This movie was great.

4533210,1,B0052YWHTQ,"Bah. They tried to have a typical ""teenage movie"" and mixed stereotypes with nothing but sex and bad parenting. Are there seriously mothers out there who act like Demi Moore did in this movie? That might explain why the younger generations behave the way they do. And the French stereotypes killed me. Whoever made this movie needs to meet authentic French people and stop relying on certain stereotypes... They also need to talk to some real American teenagers; they're not all obsessed with sex and drugs believe it or not.
And of course at the end of this movie, all's well that ends well -_-
This movie was bad. I can't believe I sat through the whole thing, I guess I had hope that it would redeem itself but it was just...bad, from beginning to end...

We were bored for a while; but then they start having sexual conversations and then there is an actual sex scene--don't show this to kids! It should be rated R for an ACTUAL on-screen sex scene! I am very disappointed and I wouldn't show it to anyone under 18 years old because of the sex scene! Not to mention obsessive drug use....but I am BAFFLED by the sex scene between Miley and the other guy (Don't remember his name--movie was so bad) I never walked out of a movie before--but we had to it was so bad and disturbing!

The portrail of a divorced parent that has nothing together raising a daughter that is an absolute brat yet is able to get the guys (are you kidding me). This movie also displays that its ok to drive in traffic with earbuds in bopping around carefree and not paying the slightist bit of attention to traffic (they might as well be driving while texting so they can be in an even more dangerous situation than they are already in). In the same movie scene the mother and daughter can not communicate even when their sitting next to each other. This movie is absolute trash!,1367020800,,771,4.586956521739131
4533278,5,B0052YWHTQ,This is a really cute and fun movie! It's just a feel good chick flick. The movie is about teens however due to the sex and pot smoking I would not actually want my teen to view it. I would say the viewing age would be more like young adult-30's.,1367020800,,246,3.94
4533279,5,B0052YWHTQ,It was very interesting to see miley Cyrus doing what she loves best and she was a teenager in love omg that is great,1367020800,,117,3.9166666666666665
4533280,3,B0052YWHTQ,"With the cast, I expected it to be better.  Very predictable movie that seemed choppy and inconsistent in certain areas.",1367020800,,120,5.0
4533281,1,B0052YWHTQ,"I'm a sucker for bad chick flicks (like the Hilary Duff, ""Raise Your Voice"" kind), but this one starts horribly, goes nowhere and ends with some weird resolution for something that wasn't even a problem in the first place (although they go to Paris and have a great time insulting the stereotypes of the French. Passport to Paris was less insulting than this was). The story sucks, even for a pre-teen chick flick. Girls, don't waste your time, you will lose brain cells watching this.",1366848000,,485,4.7176470588235295
4533282,3,B0052YWHTQ,I think it was a decent movie. I didn't set out expecting to be overly impressed and was pleasantly surprised. Give it a try!,1366761600,,125,4.25
4533283,1,B0052YWHTQ,this movie is overrated and boring every movie i see miley cyrus in i only liked one of her films out of all the movies i see her in but this movie i watched for free and it was by far her worst movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! whenever i wanna watch a real movie now i read either a book series or watch movies that appeal to me this movie was a waste of time to make and release miley cyrus is the worst actress on earth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1366761600,,444,4.235294117647059
4533284,3,B0052YWHTQ,"I bought this movie for my preteen daughter as she is a Miley Cyrus fan.  Thankfully, I watched it first before handing it over.  The movie was OK and has some real life situations that if watched together would be great conversation starters for the appropriate way to behave in certain situations.

Some reviewers have written that this is a poor betrayal of parenting.  While some of the choices may not be what they/you/I would have done, I can see some real truth to the situation.  This is why we, as parents, are responsible for teaching our children that not everything you see in a movie is a good example on how they should behave.  I personally appreaciate the honesty of the real world portrayed in this movie and the fact that it didn't sugarcoat real life.  Not everyone lives behind a white picket fence with a Mom, Dad, 2.5 children and a dog.  I love the opportunity to use this movie as an example of what I expect from my children and I can point out what is acceptable and what is not from the sceneraios portraed in this movie.  You never know you could be sending your child to spend the night at a friends house with this very family dynamic and it won't be a suprise to them what you expect from them in this situation.

In summary, the movie was OK, and if viewed with an open mind it could be a helpful parenting tool.",1366761600,,1344,4.36144578313253
4533285,4,B0052YWHTQ,Great movie with Miley and Demi.  I thought they both were wonderful in this movie.  I thought this was really entertaining.,1366761600,,124,4.857142857142857
4533286,5,B0052YWHTQ,"THis movie is Different. Nothing ridiculously dramatic, but that is what is good about it. it is very grounded and stays ""real-ish"". i will give it 5 stars to attempt to average out those that are close minded.",1366675200,,210,4.552631578947368
4533287,1,B0052YWHTQ,This movie makes it look like this type of teenager and parent to child behavior is acceptable. Its really a shame. Children should not be acting like that and parents should not be condoning or letting it happen. This whole movie was a mess.,1366675200,6,242,4.5227272727272725

4533289,3,B0052YWHTQ,"OK its an american movie, with easy sentiments, prude and big clichs (french are not like that, trust me),
but the story is ok, even if you know the end at the beginning, you like to see how it will happen
and actress are nice to watch
have fun !",1366588800,,246,3.94
4533290,5,B0052YWHTQ,"Im a huge Miley Cyrus fan, so I wanted to see this movie regardless of what it was about. I thought it looked good from the previews, so I was expecting a good movie. I cant believe all of the negativity against this film. I loved it, one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I think it can be very relatable to just about any high schooler, or at the least, enjoyable. From start to finish, I give it 5 stars. Plus Miley Cyrus and Ashley Greene are both super gorgeous, cant beat a two for one. On a side not for anybody who already watched it, did Chad remind you of Scarecrow from Batman Begins? I seriously thought it was him at first.",1366502400,,649,4.038759689922481

4533294,4,B0052YWHTQ,This was a pretty good movie all in all but it does start out rather slow. And some of the parts with Demi were strange to say the least but she is a good actress and so is Miley. Is it a movie you can watch more then once I would have to say no but it is good enough to watch the first time.,1366329600,,292,3.5076923076923077

4533297,4,B0052YWHTQ,"As I watched LOL, I really did laugh out loud. This movie is both dramatic and funny at the same time. This movie is a bout Lola Williams and her friends navigating the peer pressures of high school romance and friendship while dodging their sometimes overbearing and confused parents. I enjoyed this movie a lot and recommend it to people who are fans of Miley Cyrus, but also to people who like to laugh. But beware, this movie has sexual content and coarse language and should not be viewed by anyone under 13 years of age.",1366243200,,526,4.489583333333333
4533298,5,B0052YWHTQ,"Finally a movie where they show the bond between mother daughter and grandmother, I'm surprised about the relationship between them is beautiful and normal for many people.

4533299,1,B0052YWHTQ,"There are lots and lots of people standing in between a movie being conceptualized, green-lit, written, shot, edited, marketed and distributed. Not one of those people said 'hey, we should maybe stop throwing good money after bad and desist with making this horrible atrocious affront to storytelling because we think Miley Cyrus will get the young ladies to the theatre'. And that's the real tragedy here- that none of those professionals did anything to end this awfulness.

I made it 7 minutes and 53 seconds into the film before I had to stop it. What utter trash.

Miley is Miley, the same as she is in everything, an energetic bundle of over-rehearsed, well-meaning Disney sassafrass that never quite rings true. She demonstrates no depth of character or feeling, and she crashes through her scene work with all the care and specificity of a drunk parrot. Demi Moore is collecting a paycheck, and you can see that she gives exactly zero f@#%s about what she's doing. All the boys look like they just stepped out of a group audition for Camp Rock, I could not tell one from the other.

That's pretty much all I can say, having only seen about 8 minutes of it. Don't waste your time.",1366156800,64,1187,4.697115384615385
4533300,1,B0052YWHTQ,"I was absolutely unimpressed by LOL.  The mother-daughter relationship portrayed is a horrible example of parenting.  Your child is supposed to be your child, not your friend.

4533303,5,B0052YWHTQ,Funny chick flick. Reflects modern teenagers and their attitudes towards wanting to grow up. The acting was good and the relationships show daily problems for parents of teenagers wanting freedom and privacy.,1366156800,,208,5.53125
