8133900,5,B000GQLA8O,"As a therapist, I use this DVD frequently on inpatient psych unit.  Patients get a lot out of it & families as well.  Although disturbing in the beginning (throw-back to the early days of mental health abuse), if you can warn your patients that the first few minutes are hard and stay with it, there are lessons to be learned with how people cope and succeed in managing not only their illness, but their lives.  The stories presented here are full of hope & lessons of recovery.  I highly recommend to anyone learning about mental illness and especially therapists/treatment facilities as a teaching tool for patients & families.",1278374400,21,630,4.805555555555555
8133901,4,B000GQLA8O,"This documentary has great intentions.

It spells out the ways in which the problems of the mentally ill become everyone's problems.  If some people don't receive treatment, they become absentees or increase the numbers of the unemployed.  If health benefits don't cover mental illnesses, patients go to doctors for physical side effects when they really should be seen by therapists.  The work does a wonderful job in showing how deinstitutionalization helped to lead to the increase in the prison population.  I especially loved that the interviewees here were diverse in terms of race and gender.

The work begins by saying it was produced by an interfaith group.  As a non-religious person, I was initially disturbed by the ""churchiness"" of the piece.  But in all fairness, the work does say many individuals with problems approach their spiritual advisers before anyone else.  Also, this work both praises how churches have helped this population and criticizes them when they turn their backs on these people.  This was a well-rounded and fair-minded discussion.

As much as I am happy to have seen this work and happy that it was produced at all, I have two major concerns.  I thought the people focused upon were ""the acceptable ones.""  In our oppressive society, light-skinned blacks are treated better than dark-skinned ones.  Latinos who are bilingual are treated better than those that only speak Spanish.  Gay men and lesbians who gender-conform are treated better than those who are gender-radical.  Here, this work doesn't focus on people who are severely retarded or psychotic.  No one is shown talking to themselves or yelling in public ""I am the Lizard Queen!""  It covers depressants, bipolar people, and others.  If these people take their meds, no one would know they have problems.  These are not the people who society harshly mocks.  In so many ways, this work focuses on the people with whom the majority of Americans would be ""comfortable.""

Secondly, almost all of those who spoke about their mental challenges were fat.  I'm fat too and love seeing real bodies, rather than the made-for-Hollywood types.  They also say the camera adds 10 pounds.  Still, I think some viewers may get the impression that all people with these mental challenges also have weight issues.  Some drugs may cause weight gain, but I haven't heard that they compose the majority of treatments.  In fairness, all these interviewees seemed to be middle-aged and that may play a role in their weight.  I am just worried that resistant viewers may use this dynamic as a reason to trivialize the issues presented.",1180224000,40,2610,5.049180327868853
