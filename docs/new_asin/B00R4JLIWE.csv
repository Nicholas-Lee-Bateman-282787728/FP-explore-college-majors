6898668,5,B00R4JLIWE,"After searching through tons of kid's yoga video, we finally found one that has clear instructions, features kids and an adult, uses REAL yoga moves, and doesn't rely on campy gimmicks or distracting jump cuts to other scenes to be engaging, and is appropriate for young kids (mine is 2 years and 4 months) as well as older kids. Surprisingly, that is a tall order.  My son LOVES this video and could follow the moves - even after the first viewing.

P.S. For the yoga ball section, my son just grabbed one of his bouncy playground balls - and it was the perfect size. (His improvisation, not mine.) ;)",1471910400,4,602,4.513761467889908

6898670,5,B00R4JLIWE,"We used to be able to get several episodes of kids' yoga On Demand through our cable provider but haven't been able to find them since the new operating system. This lady is awesome at connecting with kids' imaginations to hold their attention for yoga and make it enjoyable. This is great for my son, who is 8, and I to do together (though the ones on cable had a ""do together time"" that I miss in this one). Looking for more!!",1454112000,2,428,4.2317073170731705
6898671,5,B00R4JLIWE,"My daughter loved ALMOST each set. One set requires a ball.  If we ever get one, I'm sure we'll love it too. We'd love more Jodi yoga videos for kids!!",1452643200,,151,4.033333333333333
6898672,4,B00R4JLIWE,"My son LOVES all the Gaiam yoga for kids. He asks for them every day, and runs through 2-3 episodes before he gets bored with it.
But really. The science is off. If you're going to use science to interest kids in yoga, please be current. For example, Pluto is no longer a planet.",1447113600,3,279,4.185185185185185
6898673,5,B00R4JLIWE,Bought for my 8 year old. Easy to follow. She especially loves the bonus exercise ball sequence.,1443052800,,96,4.705882352941177

6898675,5,B00R4JLIWE,"My six year old loves Yoga Kids Outer Space blast off.  She has been doing yoga since she was little and has enjoyed many yoga videos as well as just a simple practice with me.  What sets this particular video apart for us, is that it incorporates a fitness ball and she LOVED that addition.  I actually love the fact that it is not only good for her body/mind but educational as well.  When you can learn while having fun-that is a perfect combination-Jodi has a great connection with the kids and is quite engaging.  My daughter will put this video in by herself with no prompting by me and enjoy her practice;)  I would highly recommend this video!",1426032000,2,651,4.428571428571429

6898677,5,B00R4JLIWE,Just what I was looking for. This is perfect to hold the attention of a preschool group. They love doing yoga time!,1494374400,,115,4.2727272727272725
6898678,5,B00R4JLIWE,"My 6-year-old daughter waned to do yoga because she saw me do it. The videos are fun and short, so kids with a short attention spans can do them (each video is ~15 min) and won't get distracted.

The only thing I don't like is that the poses are not explained well and the instructor just kind of jumps right into them. For example, the warrior pose is not easy for kids but is shown very quickly, and the instructor very quickly switches from one leg to the next. I still like the DVD because I can show my daughter how to do the poses correctly. However, I would have liked possibly an intro video that would show how to perform the more difficult poses correctly before jumping into the main videos. Overall, the videos are great and a fun way for me to connect with my daughter before bedtime.",1491782400,2,797,4.3133333333333335
6898679,3,B00R4JLIWE,"Talks about Pluto being a planet. Later references it as a dwarf planet, but hard for me to take a video seriously when it teaches my kids wrongly.",1489449600,,147,4.285714285714286
6898680,5,B00R4JLIWE,"This DVD is great for little and big kids alike! It teaches information about planets in a fun away, and the poses are easy to follow. I particularly like the positive comments the kids do about themselves and to a partner during the practice, ""there is light in me"" and ""there is light in you"", ""I am healthy"" among others. I highly recommend it!",1488844800,,347,4.4375
6898681,5,B00R4JLIWE,My kids love this video and are attentive to it but I think the part they like best is when it requires that I participate too!,1485302400,,127,3.923076923076923

6898683,5,B00R4JLIWE,My kids age 4 and 7 love this video.  The only problem is that you can't play all ( there are 4 15 min videos).,1480809600,2,111,3.44
6898684,5,B00R4JLIWE,"My daughter is in LOVE with yoga. She is 4 years old, and locally there are no yoga classes for children under 13. It is very basic, and does change the names of common poses to match what the theme is. We also have the Dinosaur one and she loves that as well. This keeps her engaged for the entire set, all of the sections, which is absolutely amazing (as any parent of a 4 year old will tell you.)
I love that this series teaches kids ways to be active and it has helped her calm down when she is stressed. I don't know how this could be improved upon at all, I am truly happy we made this purchase!",1478563200,2,601,3.975206611570248

8694054,5,B00R4JLIWE,Bought this for my granddaughters and they are having a lot of fun watching it.  They get out their yoga mats and try to copy what the video is telling them.  They are 4 and 7 years old and it great for that age.,1531353600,,212,3.7954545454545454
