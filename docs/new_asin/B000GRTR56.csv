2617345,4,B000GRTR56,"I bought this in 1985 on VHS format, then tossed it when I converted to DVD.  I remember enjoying Felix Vivian in Pallettes and in The Ice Skaters so I rented the DVD.  It was a mess -- so dark it was nearly impossible to see what was going on.

However, I decided to purchase the DVD anyway because Felix Vivian's performance were so fantastic that I wanted them, and while too dark they were watchable.

The DVD I bought says ""digitally remastered"".  The picture was still a bit to dark, but the dancers were somehow lighted up and the who DVD was very enjoyable, and I am totally satisified.

But ---- I am not going to take a chance on POB's Seven Ballets.  Rented that one and it was totally unwatchable.",1309996800,,709,4.325757575757576
2617346,2,B000GRTR56,"I don't know what they did to the video.  The effective resolution is no better than 160x100.  The dancing is on par with other POB performances but the video transfer failed to show that.

The video is watchable on my computer in a small window.  Watching it on a modern HDTV would make you wonder if your TV is broken!  The dancers are great but you can't see them clearly to fully enjoy the program.

I guess the advance of the modern TV has made the older videos like this one unwatchable.  Very sad.

I rented this DVD from Netflix.  I would not want to own it.

2617347,2,B000GRTR56,I have many ballet performances in my collection. Mostly Russian ballet. Quality of this film is poor .I expected more colors -better stage design. Why dancers perform classical pieces in modern or may rehearsal type of costumes? I couldn't even finish watching it. Cover photo on DVD box is too promising.,1263513600,,306,5.019607843137255
2617348,5,B000GRTR56,The Paris Opera has got to be the best ballet company in the world.  There dancers are so fluid in their movement. Awesome.,1244160000,,123,4.3478260869565215
2617349,3,B000GRTR56,"I need everyone who sells the idea that six pack abs can be accomplished by the right diet and exercise to let users know that genetics has a part to play as well. While the right diet and exercise program will lead to fat loss and muscular development, there is really no guarantee that you will be able to attain the definition seen in John Basedow's abs. This video while inexpensive, is simply just a combination of ab exercises that you can get from any fitness website (for free) and put together yourself. He also spends some time talking about supplements which you can again research yourself or walk into any nutrition store to get the information you need.",1198540800,,667,4.61344537815126
2617350,5,B000GRTR56,I bought this for my son. He enjoys it very much and has quickly seen an improvement.,1182816000,,85,4.0588235294117645
2617351,5,B000GRTR56,"I'm never going to look quite like John Basedow, but by alternating the three sets of exercises (I do one set each day), which take about ten minutes or so at the most to do, for about two months now, I've seen a lot of improvement and won't be embarrassed on the beach or at the pool this summer (well, except for my complete lack of a tan).

For overall health, I think you need to combine this with a healthy, sensible diet and some other exercise (all I do are pushups and long daily walks). Six pack abs won't do anything for your arms or shoulders or anything other than your abs, but it does tone muscles that are pretty hard to build up otherwise.

Basedow demonstrates everything very well, and is a pleasant enough exercise partner.",1174867200,,742,4.369565217391305
8134349,5,B000GRTR56,"I got a six pack off this 14 years ago. Now in my 30s, I been running marathons lately and decided to do it again. It's great. You can take his variety of workouts as the basics and then do it as often and switch it up as much as you want.",1518912000,,239,3.6153846153846154
