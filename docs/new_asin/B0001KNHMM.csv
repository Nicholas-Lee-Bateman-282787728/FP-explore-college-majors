8013809,1,B0001KNHMM,"Bad movie, folks. I try to find the good in anything I watch, but this is just a mess. This film is to Jeff Wincott what&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Attack-Force/dp/B000ION79Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Attack Force</a>&nbsp;is to Steven Seagal - such a cataclysmic fall in technical and dramatic quality that you wonder whether it was put together by high school students. For particular schlock devotees, only.

The story: As an extraterrestrial plague devastates the earth, a scientist (Wincott,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mission-of-Justice/dp/6302586313/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mission of Justice</a>) rushes to a hidden facility to generate a cure - closely pursued by his murderous ex-partner and wife (Maria Ford,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Key-to-Sex/dp/B00002NDM5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Key to Sex</a>).

The conflict is driven by two very odd plot points: an evil general (Stacy Keach,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Legacy/dp/B005LAIIQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Legacy</a>) facilitating the eradication of human life so's to populate the world with a breed of superhuman created from animal DNA, and Maria Ford's character being half-mad with grief following a miscarriage and wanting to raise the creations as children. Wincott carries these embryonic critters around in a portable incubator called ""the ark,"" and spends his time blundering through a generic B-movie facility while Maria stalks him. No less than five times does Ms. Ford get the drop on Mr. Wincott, and each time he manages to escape via some stupidity (one time, he knocks her out with a mannequin torso - another time, a toilet plunger).

There are dumb scenes galore and the production values are irredeemably shallow, but what kills the movie dead is its terrible editing. The film has no sense of pacing, thanks to this. Its first half is spent trying to simultaneously further the plot while illustrating the backstory, which it does by inharmoniously hopping between scenes in the past and present. The second half just flounders on its own, because while the filmmakers were probably going for a swift and exciting pace, it just seems like the movie's trying to shove a lot of story and scenes into a short runtime - a bad decision, especially when among these should be an unnecessary sex diversion and repeated footage of Wincott's childhood nightmares (yeah, there's a whole thing on that).

The DVD cover features spacecraft in the background and Jeff wearing futuristic armor, but you'll see neither in the movie. You will, however, see crazy scenes devoted to Jeff's character's obsession with the works of Lewis Carroll, and like me, you'll wonder what the heck they're doing in here. The movie is all over the place, and isn't even entertaining for it. Don't expect good action or good acting - this film has virtually nothing to offer.",1422835200,2,3059,6.04147465437788
8013810,1,B0001KNHMM,"The earth retrieves some RNA and then later it is a virus, from a comet and deliberately crash it into Africa in hopes that it will ravage the planet of much of the human life to pave the way for the ""Aryan Messiah"" according to General Wallace (Stacy Keach). The virus managed to survive the inferno of the crash. The beginning of the film has flashbacks of John Denniel (Jeff Wincott) and him narrating his bad dream about the death of his father. John who is scientific researcher and helicopter pilot id being pursued by his wife Anna (Maria Ford) fellow researcher and helicopter pilot. She is attempting to shoot down his helicopter to recover ""the ark.""  What we notice is that their clothes are color coordinated with the color of the helicopter with Ford in red and Wincott in blue. Clearly this is the work of the genius of Roger Corman who created well coordinated costumes and vehicles in ""Death Race 2000"" perhaps the greatest snub in Oscar History since ""Billy Jack"" or anything Jennifer Aniston thinks she deserves.

What Anna wants is the other half of the story. They managed to have created zygotes of mixed human/animal genes from which they can extract serum for a cure to save the planet. He wants to extract the serum and allow the zygotes to die while Maria wants to bring the Doctor Moreau zygotes to term because they may have souls...even though they will most likely die at some point while developing.

This seem liked a great idea, but they employed deplorable actors and dialogue to bring this film to life plus the low budget aspect turned this into a nearly unwatchable film with the distraction of the idiotic Alice in Wonderland metaphors and dream sequence that should have been spent on developing a better linear plot.

Yes, Maria Ford gets naked early in the film, but if you keep watching just or another scene of her, you are wasting your time.

8013811,4,B0001KNHMM,"This is a Roger Corman Phillip Jackson Daniel Dor picture. They've done some great ones and this definitely isn't their best- yet some bits really stand out, the Man and Wife fight between protagonists Jeff Wincott and Maria Ford over what to do about a potential cure to save dying humanity is both hilarious and scary at the same time. In that sense ""Future Fear"" makes ""War of the Roses"" look like a picknick.
Stacy Keach has a cool cameo as a profetic genocidal military man.
You have to struggle a bit to stay withy the story throught the first bit, but if you do it becomes haunting and scary by the end. You'll actually talk about this one , what it all meant etc if you watch it with anyone.",976579200,7,699,4.343511450381679
