8266080,4,B000CCR4ZA,"Filmed along the West coast of New Zealand's rugged and stormy South Island, this low budget thriller is unique
and as such will not be accepted by all. Melanie (Rachael Blake) is lonely, living in a small town, working in a dead-end
job and in need of male companionship. She meets a man (Sam Neill) at a local pub and agrees to go back to his boat,
where she passes out from her drinking. When she awakes, she finds that the boat is headed out to sea. I defy anyone
to figure out the ending to this many-layered, original story, even after viewing half way through. The film tone is definately
tense and somewhat claustrophobic with a slow buildup of tension, helped by a great soundtrack and the moody landscape.",1396915200,,715,4.507692307692308
