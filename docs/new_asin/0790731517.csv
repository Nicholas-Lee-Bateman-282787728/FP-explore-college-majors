111208,4,0790731517,"I loved this movie when I first saw it in the theater. It was released on Christmas Day 1993, which was perfect timing. It has a nice, warm Christmas ""feel"" to it. And lots of snow. Jack and Walter are great again (as usual). Lots of good-natured gags throughout. (The fish-rotting-in-the-back-seat gags are a standout! Matthau's reaction to the horrific-smelling trout is hysterical!)  Keep it running at the end for that hilarious outtake reel. Burgess Meredith is a riot. Great fun!",997228800,,485,4.987654320987654
111209,4,0790731517,"This is a great and watchable ,ovie, especially if you're a Jack Lemmon(Out to Sea,Grumpier Old Men)! Its plot is great too.
Two old men start to fight over a redhead lady who is their neighbor. They keep competeing with each other to see who will get her. I don't want to give the end away-it's too funny!
This movie is hilarious-especially the take-outs at the end of the movie. The only problem in it is that the plot can get sorta old. Other than that, it's pretty much a must-see. Check out my other reviews for other comedies like the National Lampoon series!",984096000,2,565,4.4423076923076925
111210,5,0790731517,"This is a quite unusual movie, because it has no young lead characters. The only younger is the men's children and their families. Of the lead characters, the youngest is played by 52-year-old (at the time) Ann-Margret. All the actors are very good especially Lemmon, Matthau, Meredith and Ann-Margret make this movie very good and charming. The writer and director have also made good jobs. I recommend this movie to everybody.",977097600,2,428,5.042253521126761

When attractive Ariel (Ann Margret) moves into the house across the  street,Max and John become all out enemies,stopping at nothing to win  Ariel's affections. Full of great pranks like puttting dead fish in each  other's cars,this movie is a perfect heartwarming comedy.

111212,5,0790731517,"Being a thirty-something woman, I thought, how could I possibly find a movie about two grumpy old men funny?  Turns out, VERY EASILY!  If I could give this movie TEN STARS, I would!  This has to be my all-time, favorite  comedy.  Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are at it again; creating that  perfect ""odd-couple"" chemistry.  This time, the story is set in  snowy Minnesota, with Lemmon and Matthau, (two old-time rivals), competing  for the attentions of the refreshingly eccentric, yet extremely attractive  widow, who has just moved into their neighborhood. The writing in this film  is excellent; the actor's comedic timing is pure genius, and the zingers  never seem to stop!  This movie is a classic!  Don't be a putz - buy it  today!",948153600,22,740,4.854838709677419

Neighbors John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon), and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) have always been friendly rivals that play practical jokes on each other. Things really heat up with the arrival of a vivacious neighbor Ariel Truax (Ann-Margret).",1507334400,2,408,5.181818181818182

111237,1,0790731517,"I own this movie on VHS.  I rewatch it from time to time because of the excellent performances by the cast.  I watch it despite how very hideous the relationship between John and Max truly is.  This time around, the fact that the immensely manipulative Ariel character is, without a doubt, what was referred to in high school as a c_ _ k tease, (there is no more apt description), has reached its zenith.  These men were far better off with their grudges and pranks. Ariel, who you will notice, if you watch 'Grumpier' old men, turns from the high-spirited woman of the original movie, into the same kind of frump that 'Maria"" did in The Sound of Music, immediately following marriage.  But the Ariel character is one wicked woman, and the degree to which the old buddies are taken in, is pathetic.",1487635200,,798,4.5524475524475525

The romance portrayed is improbable (I speak from experience at age 72, but not bitterness)but helps tie the plot together. When all is said and done, the opposite of love is not hate, it's neglect.

111788,5,0790731517,"A classic in film comedy.  If you've ever had anything to do with folks from this part of the country, it's even funnier because the humor from that area is right on the mark.  Enjoyed the new widescreen version especially.",1384905600,,223,4.55

111800,5,0790731517,"It's no surprise that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are the stars of this movie after being together in The Odd Couple together many years prior.  It's almost as if the story has continued, but the two at odds men live next door to each other instead of in the same apartment.  Their quips and their tendencies are similar to their original characters and it works perfectly.  The nostalgia in us flares only because these two juggernauts of comedy and acting are now no longer capable of making the movies we so loved.

Grumpy Old Men focuses on two older gentlemen with similar interests, different lifestyles, and a penchant for going at each other every chance they get.  Their love-hate relationship tips more towards hate when a vibrant woman moves across the street from them.  Their snowy Minnesota town of Wabashaw becomes a playing ground for slapstick antics and attempts to win over the lady next door.  Their friendship becomes estranged and hilarity ensues when they butt heads.

It's a love story, a story of friendship, of life and death, and of social relations done brilliantly in the line of the Odd Couple rehashed into Grumpy Old Men.",1379462400,,1156,4.803030303030303

Your guaranteed laugh out loud moments with Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon working together. The on screen chemistry with these two has always been great. It has some mild foul language that you would expect from old friends feuding, but nothing most 9 year olds haven't heard now a days. Be sure to watch through to the credits the outtakes are just as humorous as anything.",1372550400,,534,4.572916666666667

111856,5,0790731517,"My bargain-rack movie for last night was ""Grumpy Old Men"" starring Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann-Margaret. I found it on the five-dollar rack at Wal-Mart and jumped at the chance to buy it. Lemmon and Matthau are two of my favorite old-line comedians. I remembered when the show first came out and I missed it because of an overly busy schedule. Well, these two ""Senior Comedians"" play a couple of aging Middle-School chums to perfection. All the middle school insulting language and pranks are still there even though these guys have aged an additional 55 years and each has gone through a marriage. Now they're both bachelors again and living next to one another in their well-aged middle-school condition. It's funny. Trust me. And they bring it off well, right from the opening all the way through. The scene is complicated by the arrival of a new woman (Ann-Margaret) in the neighborhood, something of a rivalry romance develops and it's right back to the good-old high-school days when they were sparring over a different girl.

Add to the story that everything took place in a Minnesota winter. It made me realize how much I enjoyed the winters in this part of the country and how boring things are in San Diego winters. Alas, It was a good setting and had a lot of winter activities such as snowmobiles and ice fishing. The winter scenery was very well done. Just as I remembered. Nice touch. The acting was excellent and the story unfolded at a nice pace. The romance between Lemmon and Ann-Margaret seemed a bit unrealistic, but hey, this is a comedy. In any case, I'm now 76 and they were 68, and I winced here and there but thoroughly enjoyed the movie.

111859,5,0790731517,Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau come together in this very funny film.  After seeing it you can almost imagine it as a preview of things to come as people age.  It was very enjoyable.  Seeing two grown men fight and carry on over a woman.  There are a lot of reasons to enjoy this film.  One of which for me was seeing Burgess Meredith in it.  I watched all the Rocky films so and most of them included him in the cast so seeing him cast in this film as well was very delightful.  I also enjoyed the work that Ossie Davis did in this work.

111866,4,0790731517,"First, I give the movie 5 stars. Unfortunately the DVD was released in Warner's bad old days of the cheapest possible release with really not much to recommend the presentation over the VHS.

Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau made a number of strong comedies together, and this one does not disappoint. Set as aging widower neighbors who haven't gotten along since they both loved the same girl in their youth (Lemmon's character Gustafson married her), the two feud, play pranks on each other, and exchange very funny barbed quips throughout the movie.

When widowed Ann-Margret (as beautiful as ever) moves in across the street, the old rivalry cooks up again. The irrepressibly vivacious woman puts some spice (or at least hopes of spice) back in their lives. Complicating matters are their kids. Matthau's son had a life long crush on Lemmon's daughter, and when she moves back in with Dad after separating from her husband, a second chance is at hand.

Burgess Meredith delights as Lemmon's father, in one of his last performances.

The movie is warm and funny and bittersweet. The performances of the two stars in one of their later roles is not to be missed by fans of these two fine actors.",1299888000,,1195,4.814634146341463

111872,4,0790731517,"First of all let me say, in this review I intend to review the movie itself, not the content of the package.  I could go on and on about the lack of bonuses, the full-screen aspect ratio, and whatever else is bringing down the overall rating of this DVD, but I simply don't want to go there.  After all, I view bonuses as mere ""eye candy"" -- they are not the main reason for buying a movie.

Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are comedic gold.  This film is no exception.  I love to watch the old men bicker with each other, and watching them compete with undeniable jealousy over the same woman is hysterical.  The many pranks and games they get into with each other are very funny.  Watching two old men fight could never be more enjoyable!

So, despite what one could call a wasted opportunity, it is still a movie well worth watching.  The sequel, ""Grumpier Old Men,"" is also quite good.",1248652800,,888,4.365853658536586
111873,5,0790731517,"Grumpy Old Men is probably my favorite comedy of all time. I saw it in the theater back when it came out, then bought the VHS tape as soon as it was released. Then when DVD's took off, I waited and waited and waited for it to be released. It finally was, but only in FULL SCREEN. So I never bought it and only ever had the VHS version until this Bluray came out. Nothing more needs to be said about this movie, it is hilarious and heart-warming at the same time. A gem of a movie that shows you do not have to act old just because you hit your 60's, 70's or 80's. So I won't say any more about that... I will say it is so nice to finally see this in widescreen, and for a movie pushing 20 years old, the picture quality is great. It is a BIG bummer that all that is included on this Bluray disc is ONE trailer. This is easily the weakest Bluray I own when it comes to bonus features. But... I feel happy to get the movie and since it was only [...] bucks new, I can't complain.

Audio is 2-channel Dolby Digital --> so 80s
This Blu-Ray version does not come with any extras worth mentioning. No commentaries, no interviews, no previews (which is actually good), and only Blu-Ray Profile 1.0.

I should say that its mostly available light looking and mostly drab and overcast so I think its pretty good as blu-rays go. I paid a bit over $10 and I'm delighted...sure I'd have been happy for some PR interviews the actors did as bonus items but for a crisp and finally Widescreen version of this movie I'm happy.

But it will have 2 English language tracks!  And BOTH in 2.0!  (Man, you guys really went all out!)  Well, to give the studio credit, one of the tracks is lossless HD, so you won't have to listen to all that horrible hissing noise you will (not) hear (anyway) on that rusty old Dolby Digital track.

111879,5,0790731517,"First off, I must show an obvious bias toward this movie.  The setting is Wabasha, Minnesota.  It IS NOT a fictional place.  It is located about halfway between St. Paul, MN and LaCrosse, WI on US-61, which is one of the most scenic highways in America, especially in the autumn.  My mother was raised in Wabasha, and my late father born and raised 15 miles away in Lake City, which is where my mother lives today. It is where I actually call my ""home away from home."" So of course, there are many aspects of the movie I can personally relate to, like the real Slippery's in Wabasha, which in real life is much classier than a throw-your-peanut-shells-on-the-floor tavern.  The people living in this area are very down to earth and friendly, and for many, fishing and snowmobiling in winter is a way of life as portrayed in this movie.  The city of Wabasha (population 2600) has so exploited the ""grumpy flicks"" they now host a Grumpy Old Men Festival every February!  How cool is that???

Now considering these facts, Max Goldman (played by Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (played by Jack Lemmon) truly exemplify the persona of real life in Wabasha, with the twist being these two very schmucky widowers who having known each other since childhood, living next door to each other most of their lives, and still have NEVER gotten along with each other. That's when the lovely Ariel Truax (played by Ann Margaret) moves into the house across the street while accepting a faculty position at Winona State University (where my late father actually went to college) some 30 miles away. This sends the two ""grumpys"" into an infatuated tizzy, and they both put on their best impression in schmoozing her, with the grumpy old man Gustafson finally winning out. The movie is complete with off-the-wall pranks and schmucky humor, and John Gustafson's dad (played by Burgess Meredith), in his second-to-last acting role, is an absolute scream with his antics. Some of the language contained herein is rather vulgar, and I would not recommend anyone younger than age 17 to watch it unless with a parent.

111887,5,0790731517,"I read in an interview that Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon had never had one argument in their life. That struck me as surprising since the two argue so well - and there's a whole lot of arguing in this 1993 movie that spawned one sequel.

This particular movie holds a special interest for me. My family in the United Kingdom had hosted a Minnesota student in the 1980s and so I have made a number of return trips to the state over the years. When this movie was released I was spending the Christmas holidays with friends in the `Land of 10,000 Lakes' where this is set and saw this movie with a girlfriends family on New Year's Eve. There's something to be said about watching a Minnesota movie among a crowd of Minnesotans - they just get the humor and are so self-deprecating that when the movie pokes fun at their culture (ice fishing huts ON the lake) they take it in their stride with good humor.

Set in the fictional town of Wabasha, Minn. the movie follows the age-old rivalry between John Gustafson (Lemmon) and  Max Goldman (Matthau) and the interest they share in their new neighbor across the street, the free-spirited Ariel Truax (played by the timeless beauty Ann-Margret.)

Of course the highlight of this movie is seeing the two (Matthau and Lemmon) shoot of barbs at each other. The characters apparently were friends when younger but a woman caused the two to break off a friendship and the arrival of Truax has reawakened all those feelings. In fact one of the overriding images I have of this movie is the sight of Max trying to spear John with a frozen fish as Burgess Meredith storms through a crowd of on-lookers to order him to ""Put that fish down!"" It's hard to tie down exactly why this movie works so well and has so many gut-busting moments, the two obviously have a great chemistry and their comic timing is second to none. The barbs are funny and the pranks that they play on each other are both ingenious (Max using his TV remote to change Johns TV channel as the latter is trying to follow the lottery results) and at times juvenile (John putting a fish in the back of Max's truck).

Combined they gel into one very funny movie. And the coup de grace comes when Max shows his true affection for John by helping him after he suffers a stroke, both in getting him to the hospital and then in fighting for him with the IRS man who is determined to seize Gustafson's home.

There is also that golden  moment at the hospital when the nurse asks him if he is ""friend or family"" to John and after a moments pause Max admits ""friend."" Some have accused this movie if losing it's way in its final act, but personally I find the closing minutes of the movie to be among the best dramatically and let's face it - who wouldn't like to see this particular IRS man get his comeuppance.

Added to this movie are the two long suffering children of the pair. Daryl Hannah (whatever happened to her) appears as John's daughter Melanie and Kevin Pollak appears as Max's son Jacob.

A word of caution, there is some very adult language in this movie, in fact some referred to it as ""Dirty Old Men' back when it was released. If you have only seen this movie on TV where some words of dialogue are noticeably changed, then chances are you have not been exposed to the great comic timing of Matthau and Lemmon.

This movie is available by itself or as part of a collection with its inferior (but still funny) sequel GRUMOIER OLD MEN. In both instances however the movie is only available in full-screen. Hopefully Warner will release a widescreen version with special features in the future. But for now sit back and enjoy two masters of comedy work their magic, and be sure the stick around for the outtakes at the end  which are usually edited - probably for language, from TV broadcasts. They are all extremely funny and elicited some of the biggest laughs with the audience I saw the movie with.",1148515200,,3912,4.4726507713884995
111888,5,0790731517,"Walter Matthau was a well established character actor the first time he was paired up with headliner Jack Lemmon in The Fortune Cookie.  Two years later the were reteamed in the movie that would elevate them to superstars, The Odd Couple.  The would make twelve films together (one Jack just directed (Kotch), one they would just have a few scenes together (The Grass Harp) and one they never had a scene together (JFK)).  Grumpy Old Men was the seventh film together.

John (Jack) and Max (Walter) have been lifelong neighbors who have been feuding most of the time.  Both are widowed with children (Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollock).  They both share a passion for fishing - summer and winter ice fishing.

Things hit a fever pitch when Alex (Ann-Margret) buys the house across the street from the boys.  Alex is a sexy free spirited widow.  Both men want Alex and do anything to one up the other to get her attentions.

Things even heat up between the kids.  They have always liked each other but never acted on it.  Now they are both single, they decide to act on it.

This is a variation of The Odd Couple characters thirty years later.  While Oscar and Felix were still in their prime, Max and John are at the end.  Oscar and Felix's differences stemmed from their personality traits and Max and John's were from social conditions.

In any case, this is one of the best teamings of Jack and Walter.  Add to this a hilarious performance by Burgess Meridith as John's father.  While Ann-Margret is an unrealistic choice for their object of desire but she handles it perfectly.

The interplay of Mathau and Lemon contrasting an appearance of hate but with a genuine love for each other is not common in real life.

The attempt to always have the upper hand on each other even in the the love of a woman causes one to feel passionately for each of them. And, the love of each for the children of both brings the families closer together with each new scene.

It is a comical love story. It is always worth watching on a cool night with a fire in the fireplace and warm thoughts of a love in your own life.

111891,3,0790731517,"When this film came out in 1993, many people were surprised at how well this film performed with critics and audiences. Indeed, by that time, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann - Margret were no longer surefire box office draws, but enough people were still interested in them, since ""Grumpy..."" grossed $70,000,000 at the box office.

The problem is, 11 1/2 years later, ""Grumpy Old Men"" isn't as good as many remember it. A lot of the jokes between Lemmon and Matthau seem dated, and while both turn in excellent performances, you can kind of tell they weren't completely satisfied with the movie. (In 1995, when Entertainment Weekly did an article on the sequel ""Grumpier Old Men"", Matthau confessed he only did the first one for money). When you boil it all down, Ann-Margret kind of carries the movie, as it tends to get boring when she's not onscreen. I actually was upset that she didn't get as much screen time as I thought she had. I saw ""Grumpier Old Men"" (the sequel) first, and noticing how much screen time Sophia Loren got (nearly every scene), I expected the same treatment for Ann. However, the film sometimes goes over 10 minutes without her. I am compelled to say the reason I watch this film is because she looks very beautiful in it. (For proof of what I'm saying, fast forward to the scene where Matthau visits Ann's house for the first time, and pay attention to her outfit, a dark red shoulderless sweater. Even at 51, she still could grab a man's eye).

The film's plot is standard comedy fodder. Two old codgers named John Gustafson (Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) have been best enemies for over 50 years. They trade of playful, insulting banter about each other's fishing skills and how much sex they had (I will admit that Lemmon's line ""I've laid more pipe in this town than Wabasha plumbing"" is priceless and quotable). However, all that changes when a beautiful yet highly eccentric widown Ariel Truax (Ann-Margret) moves in across the street. Both men are immediately smitten, and their little fights become an all out war. Both vie for her affections, and at first John has the upper hand, until Max makes him feel sorry for him and practically forces him to give her up. By the time Lemmon's character suffers a heart attack, the film becomes achingly predictable, and while the outtakes at the end are funny, I still felt underwhelmed.

I was particularly peeved about the treatment of certain actors, specifically Burgess Meredith. As Lemmon's fiesty ninety-something father, Meredith gave out some great lines and carries a lot of the scenes without Ann-Margret. But overall, his role is basically an extended cameo, and this film really could have used him more. The fact that I felt that the blossoming love between Matthau's son (Kevin Pollak, who is always an entertaining asset to any of his projects) and Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and John's IRS troubles (featuring a stern IRS agent portrayed very well by Buck Henry) took center stage more often than the actual plot, plus the fact that Ossie Davis' character was also after Ann-Margret made the film seem to cluttered, didn't help my opinion of the film.

So, in conclusion, Ann-Margret and Burgess Meredith are still great in their roles, the joy of seeing Matthau and Lemmon onscreen again still reverberates throughout the film, and the scenery is still awe - inspiring, but ""Grumpy Old Men"" may not be as good as some might remember it.",1121558400,,3454,4.80976430976431
111892,5,0790731517,"What more can be said about this movie that already hasn't been said. When it has Mathau and Lemmon, it's probably going to be funny and written to fit their styles. And boy does it ever.

The laughs start and never stop until the movies is over. Their are even a few bloopers that they show as the credits roll. Other than that, there isn't much to this DVD. Just a great movie with a great cast of characters. And the price i got this for is unbeatable (unless it was free).",1120348800,,476,4.173913043478261
111893,4,0790731517,"It's hard to avoid a certain melancholy watching this 1993 Lemmon/Matthau hit these days.  All of the film's ""old men""--grumpy or otherwise--have died in recent years. Most recently Ossie Davis who played the more aimiable Chuck.  And of course, Lemmon and Matthau were preceeded a few years in death by Burgess Meredith, who as Lemmon's crusty father, provided some of the film's biggest laughs.  (Don't miss the now-legendary comic outtakes that run over the final credits.)  One can't exactly talk about a ""GRUMPY OLD MEN curse"" or anything.  These were all men fairly well advanced in years, but it adds a certain melancholic tinge to to the various death-related gags--of which there are several--in the movie.

But GOM is also, as they say, a ""life affirming"" movie.  Nothing truly original, certainly, but it comes by its laughs and tears about as honestly as any Hollywood film ever does.  Lemmon and Matthau could have walked through roles clearly written for them.  They riff of each other like they did previously in THE ODD COUPLE movies, and they do so with such finesse that it's hard not to love 'em.  And then there's Ann-Margret, looking great, and acting as kooky and as unconventional as she ever did in any 60s era flick.  Is it kookiness of a conventional Hollywood sort?  Well, yes and no.  She's clearly meant to be a breath of fresh air on the frozen Minnesota tundra.  And she pulls  it off.  Her unconventionality is pretty much dream factory standard issue--midnight snowmobile rides and 1 AM drop by visits to a new neighbor are eccentricity writ pretty darn large.  But this is Ann-Margret we're talking about.  And she imbues her character with genuine warmth and sexiness, so much so that Lemmon's character can only be said to be lapsing into downright idiocy to even think of giving her up for the sake of friendship.

Matthau and Lemmon were great comic actors.  GOM is an entertainment, not great filmmaking.  But it's good entertainment.  And ""life affirming"" at that.",1116028800,2,2004,4.884272997032641

Watching seasoned pros like Jack Lemmon, Burgess Meredith and Walter Matthau do what they do best is always worth the price of admission or purchase.  Ann-Margret who is aging wonderfully brings a sense of la dolce vita to these crusty old men's drab lives, and Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah add some youthful exuberance as well.  Ossie Davis is also fine as a store owner who is the first to accept Margret's invitation to enjoy life to the fullest.  With a snowy Minnesota background and some fun scenes, GRUMPY OLD MEN is a delightfully entertaining film, and only serves to remind us of the losses of some of these fine actors.",1115683200,,755,4.611940298507463
111895,2,0790731517,"Ok, so i'm young and probally thats the reason I really couldn't get into this film. Maybe, maybe not. To get to the point, this movie really bored me. I rarely fall asleep while watching a film, but this one was given that honor. If you found your grandparents stories boring, then this film will probally not be on your top ten list. If you enjoyed those long, memories grandpa used to tell, then this one should be given a chance. For me, I didn't like it, but whose to say you won't.

Watching two older men fight and squabble over things that should most likely have been forgotten the moment  they happened does not influence me in any way shape or form. Plus, the fact that a substantially older (Younger?) love interest suddenly moves into the neighborhood rather made me feel patroninzing than thrilled over the turn of events.

What transpires could have been funny if there where just a few less age aproppriate jokes peppered throughout. Age appropriate by being so old, that I either didn't understand them or relate.

111896,5,0790731517,"One of the most superb comedies ever filmed, Grumpy Old Men showcases the multidimensional talents of two of Hollywood's most accomplished actors, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. With the additional brilliant comic performance of Burgess Meredith, Grumpy Old Men transforms from a gem of a picture into one of the funniest movies ever made. A sweeping commercial success, the film spawned the sequel Grumpier Old Men - a rare breed of movie that almost lived up to the quality of the original...

In Grumpy Old Men, lifelong friends and neighbors John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) trade jibes on a daily basis against the backdrop of the frozen Minnesota tundra. Maintaining a relationship that appears to be nothing more than a give and take of acerbic sarcasm, the two men actually enjoy a strong bond of kinship that has lasted all their lives. Widowed and retired, both men live a confined and comfortable existence, defined by routine ice fishing trips and visits from immediate family.

But John and Max both find new life when a rambunctious vixen named Ariel Truax (Ann-Margret) moves into the neighborhood. Ariel befriends both men who act as if they aren't interested in her because of their inner fears of leaving their comfort zone. It takes the actions of their friend, local fish store owner Chuck (Ossie Davis), to jar the two men from their comfortable, yet boring lives. When Chuck pays a visit to Ariel's house late one night, he rouses the jealousy of both men who instantly transform into competitors for Ariel's affections.

While Max seemingly has the upper-hand in the quest, the tables quickly turn in John's favor when Ariel communicates her feelings during a late night visit to the Gustafson abode... Meanwhile, John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollack) develop a romantic relationship with one another.

With John and Ariel becoming an item themselves, a wedge is further driven between John and Max who continue their feuding unabated. Only a true father can break up these two fighting boys, which John's father does... But will their friendship be ruined forever?

Flooded with countless one-liners, perfect delivery of insults, and an endless number of comic scenes, Grumpy Old Men is one of the most hilarious films you'll ever have the pleasure of enjoying. The onscreen magic between Lemmon and Malthau is unsurpassed by any comedy duo before or since, and the screenplay is expertly written. In fact, the closing credits may actually be more entertaining than the film itself, which is quite an accomplishment. As the credits run the course of the screen, original outtakes from the film are shown. Burgess Meredith steals the show with his matter-of-fact, coarse utterances, such as ""Looks like Chuck's gonna' bury his bone!""

With well-timed humor, and the ingenious performances of several Hollywood veterans, it's no surprise that Grumpy Old Men ranks as a definite must-see film. If you haven't seen it, you have no idea what you've been missing. Trust me, you could rent a hundred films before coming across something that's even close to being as funny as this one...

Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are great together as a comedy team, and Anne Margret is as good in this one as she was in The Villain, with Kirk Douglas.  They should be so lucky as to have such a dish fall for them, at their age.  No wonder Lemmon had the heart attack!

These two were the perfect match for an EXCELLENT movie like this. The plot of the movie is great. The setting of cold and snowy Wabasha, MN was a the perfect setting.
The movie starts out on a snowy morning with two rivaling neighbors John Gustufson (Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Matthau). These two have been at each other's throats since they were kids. They always insult each other like calling each other a putz, a moron, or even a schmuck and other rude names. Whatever the two do they compete against each other to be better. One of those things they compete against is they both ice fish everyday and Max always ends up with more fish than John. So one day after they finish fishing, Max has half a dozen fish and John only has two. So Max of course picks on him and John throws one of his dead fishes into Max's car which causes a terrible stench.
That night John is watching the lottery and Max has the same T.V. remote so while John's watching the numbers Max over in the next window switches the channel. Then John switches it back then Max does it again and again. Finally John finds out it's Max and Max's son Jake (Pollak) opens the window to make him apologize and when Max goes to the window, John sprays his garden hose at him. Will these two ever stop fighting?
Then the rivalry takes another step up when a beautiful new neighbor Ariel (Ann-Margret) moves in and catches the attention of Max and John. Ariel is a lovely, warm-hearted, spirited woman who Max and John start fighting over. Max takes her ice fishing where she catches a 3-foot fish that she actually THROWS BACK before Max can take a picture of it. Then John and Ariel have dinner together and then go snowmobiling together and eventually sleep together. MAX IS FURIOUS!!!
Now Max and John are out fishing and Max is thinking of how to seek revenge. So John is in his shanty when it starts moving. He looks out the window and Max is moving it with his car heading straight for THIN ICE. John jumps out and his shanty is sunk. Of course Max is in his car chanting, ""Yeah!"" The two finally have a brawl and John is convinced that Max deserves Ariel more than he does because John can't support her because his house is about to be taken away from the IRS.
Will John get her or will Max? This movie is a great comedy everyone can enjoy. It's very touching and loving and is full of laughs. Your comedy collection is not complete without ""Grumpy Old Men."" This is a 5-Star MASTERPIECE!",1054684800,11,2635,4.435051546391753

They're both very capable dramatic actors, and each has an Academy Award as proof, but their signature trademark will always be their comedic ability.
In this movie, Lemmon and Matthau play the roles of John and Max, respectively.  John and Max have been next-door neighbors their whole lives, and though they have an extremely hostile love/hate relationship, they remain each other's best friend.  Their hostility stems from decades before when John wound up marrying the girl they both loved.  Both are now widowers who live alone in their separate houses, and a woman named Ariel (Ann-Margret) moves into the house across the street.  Both men are immediately smitten by Ariel, and it leads to a rehashing of the same hostile feelings they once held for each other in their youth.
While the plot may seem like heavy material, it really isn't.  The story is presented in a extremely touching yet light-hearted way.  Both John and Max are extremely loveable, and the audience is made to feel sorry for them because both are lonely in their old age.  The only flaw in this movie is in the plausability of Ariel actually having romantic feelings for either of these two men.  She's a relatively young woman and energetic woman, and the fact that she has these two old men fighting for her attention doesn't seem quite believable.

What happens is the adventures of two bitter old ice fishermen that compete for the affections of their new neighbor.  Some of the pranks they pull on each other are so funny you'll find yourself laughing hysterically.

The screenplay is at once very funny and touching, telling with tongue in cheek the good things and the bad things about being old. To remind us that age is only comparative, one of the old men's fathers is also here, played hilariously by Batman's Burgess Meredith. He shows the two younger 'old men' that there is still lots of fun to be had and perhaps lots of years left if you're lucky. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau hasn't faded over the years, and they still work off each other well. As someone who has been to Minnesota in wintertime I could almost feel the cold biting through those poor guys' clothes as they went ice fishing. The delightful Ann-Margret (does she never look older?) is excellent casting as someone who could at once be near enough Lemmon's age to have a relationship with him and also look young enough to be a seemingly unattainable object of his lust.
