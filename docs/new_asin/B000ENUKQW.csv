2524428,3,B000ENUKQW,"My girls and I LOVE Winx Club!!!!  It's our favorite show.  We were so excited to buy these DVD's - we bought the first 4.  HOWEVER - these are DIFFERENT from the ones currently running on Nickelodeon.  They are NOT as good.  My girls don't seem to mind, but there is a big difference.  It seems that these ran before  (early 2000's?) and were re-tooled for the current TV run.  These appear to be the OLD episodes before the re-tooling.  For example, many voices are different (my girls noticed that), Tecna wears a weird hat and has an English accent.  The music is not NEARLY as good, and one reason we love Winx Club is the great music (which we download and listen to from amazon's MP3's).  They also seem more violent, and for more ""mature"" audiences - this particular collection has Riven telling Sky that Bloom ""hooked up"" with lots of guys at school and why would he want to date her?  Then two older ladies, teachers at the fairy schools, talk about when some guy was two-timing them.  They also seem more violent, and the characters aren't as fleshed-out personality-wise.

So....these will do for my kids but I'm really disappointed that they are so different from the current episodes.  I wish they had disclosed somehow that these are episodes that ran elsewhere, or somehow told me that up-front.  I hope they release the newer episodes in DVD form.",1349913600,4,1364,4.620833333333334
