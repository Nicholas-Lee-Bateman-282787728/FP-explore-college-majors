This movie opens with a sound only recording of the Stones retrospecting their careers at 50 years in. No cameras were allowed, so the film blends in archive footage of the Stones dating all the way back to the starting point. The cameras were out for the Stones' first tour, and even before. You are immersed in mostly B&W footage of the band... on the stage, backstage, in the streets, at the airports. You see and hear how the boys reacted to the fame as it rose up to overcome the group, as well as society around them. You take a ride on the Rolling Stones roller coaster through the years via a unique backstage pass.

The closeups of a very young Mick Jagger are revealing. Even though I grew up with the Stones I was reminded as never before what a lamb Jagger was; gentle, soft spoken, soft skinned, baby-faced and girlish. But the lamb turned into a lion when Mick picked up a mic! What a startling juxtaposition!

One fascinating passage is when one of the Stones comments on the pea running down the aisles during concerts. Young girls getting so worked up they lost control of the bladders. That was how the 60s characterized the phenomenon, but of course today we are wiser regarding the inner workings of female plumbing. Hmmm.

Definitely worth watching if for no other reason than the footage of the 60's.",1480809600,,1467,4.545454545454546

8563706,5,B00B7QNPYO,"first off, I admit it. I love the Stones so I am a bit biased. Having said that, I have seen and owned a large number of films about the Stones, Beatles, Dylan, Doors, Hendrix and other iconic ""sixties"" bands ... this one, Crossfire Hurricane is at the top. I loved the history of the Stones but the most outstanding part of the film is the music. Crossfire Hurricane has more AMAZING live performances than I can count. Almost all of the music on the film is outstanding.  It also features the best editing I have ever seen in a rock movie. while the Stones sing, the editor seamlessly blends in several different performances from different venues with Mick and Keith in different costumes and he does it so flawlessly, that it takes a moment to realize what you are watching. My son, who's not much of a Stones fan, fell in love with them when he got to hear this film. the Stones are great on Vinyl or CD, but they are FANTASTIC to see live ... and Crossfire Hurricane serves up the best live Stones I have ever seen (and yes, I have seen them in person) ... if you like the Stones, you'll love this.  If you LOVE THE STONES ... you couldn't have a better record of that than this. I almost bought a seventy-five dollar imported copy until I spotted it here at Amazon. The price is amazingly reasonable. Buy it today. Share it with your friends.",1371340800,,1349,4.349206349206349
