7624095,4,B01B8OVALE,"I honestly had a great time watching it. Had a number of really funny, belly laugh moments. I even had to rewind a few parts because I was still laughing and missing the dialogue. If you like TJ Miller, it's a no brainer. Adam and Richard are great as well. This is one I will re-watch.",1463443200,2,286,4.125

8749701,5,B01B8OVALE,"When the love of his life (Shannon Woodward) jilts him at the altar thanks to his hard partying pals Jason (T.J. Miller) and Evan (Adam Pally), Nardo (Thomas Middleditch) follows her down to Mexico where he's carjacked and left naked in the middle of nowhere. Reluctantly calling Jason and Evan to help him with his runaway bride-to-be, Nardo gets into all kinds of trouble and so does his 2 man rescue party. They run into all kinds of messes and each is hysterical and so funny. These 3 guys were perfect and if you are a lover of ""Hangover"" you will love this too. I thought this was so funny, I laughed out loud so many times as did my friends when we watched it. The circumstances that these guys get into are really a laugh riot. Let me just say that I think you will enjoy this if you have the type of sense of humor that likes some crude stuff and just fast paced wit.",1510531200,,876,4.251497005988024

8749703,4,B01B8OVALE,"At first I thought Search Party was going to be pretty lousy.  We see three marijuana smoking guys sitting in a van having a ""deep"" discussion.  One of them (Thomas Middleditch's character) is about to get married, but his friends misinterpret him when he says marriage is like jumping off a bridge. It's just a figure of speech man!  When you're about to do something life-changing and drastic you say these kinds of things.  This movie improves a lot pretty soon and turns into an awesome -but really silly- comedy!

The next day when Thomas gets married, his one friend (T.J. Miller) storms into the wedding and disrupts everything!  He hilariously says ""I'm here because I love him!"" referring to Thomas, but he says it like he's saying he loves men which confuses the family/friends who've gathered around, lol.  He meant to say he's here to save his friend from doing something he'll regret- that being marriage.  When one of the kids in the crowd laughs, T.J. says ""Your bangs are longer than your face!""  lol  This prompts the wedding to be called off... and a punch to Thomas balls by the upcoming wife (Shannon Woodward's character!)

T.J. Miller is one of those kind of friends who ruins everything.  He always says the wrong thing, has a silly side that rubs people the wrong way, and is just an all around nuisance.  However he's also REALLY hilarious!  The only reason I'm not giving this movie 5 stars is because the comedy segments get a little TOO silly at times.

Anyway now that the wedding's off, Thomas lies around at home depressed.  He thinks he's dirt and garbage, and though his friend disagrees (Adam Pally's character) he just pulls the blanket over Thomas' face as he heads off to work, lol.  Turns out Thomas' wife went to Mexico and Thomas feels the need to head down there to make up.  But when he does, he becomes stranded and confused (and naked!).  He calls up T.J. and begs for T.J. and Adam to drive down to Mexico and pick him up, but T.J. warns Thomas of all the snakes that can bite.  He even lists them all, lol.

This movie is basically split into two stories for 70% of it.  One story involves Thomas stuck in Mexico and doing whatever it takes to survive.  He bargains with a nearby Mexican woman to make a phone call but he's unable to pay her back which results in the woman about to stab him.  However just then a cop shows up and the woman pretends this naked man is about to rape her and screams for help.  The cop chases Thomas around this small town until he finds himself in the back of a cocaine-shipping truck involving dangerous drug dealers driving across the desert.  When the two Mexican men arrive to their building, they discover Thomas and that he's covered in cocaine.  He rambles total nonsense when the Mexicans find him as a means of defense, but one of the Mexicans only pretends he can't understand English but actually understands Thomas very well when he mentions jacuzzi's, lol.

Everything's all fine and good until the boss of the drug dealers appears- J.B. Smoove's character.  He's a boisterous and nutty in the head drug dealer who speaks clear English, and he... licks the cocaine off Thomas' face, lol.  Hey, you can't shoot the guy if he's covered in cocaine sweetness now can you!  The blood would drip and ruin it, lol.  Thomas argues that J.B. doesn't have the quality of a Mexican, lol.  That enrages J.B!  It's hilarious when Thomas frees himself from the roped chair, jumps in the truck and drives away but... he has to stay down while driving away because the gunfire of the drug dealers is quite heavy, so he drives backwards out of the building... only to accidentally turn around and return, LOL!

Meanwhile his friends, T.J. Miller and Adam Pally, have their own problems.  Adam can't talk to women without making a fool of himself.  When he tries to talk to the business woman he works with (Alison Brie) he can never speak properly and accidentally makes several sexual jokes which just confuses her, lol.  T.J. and Adam take off for Mexico in search of their friend, and along the way they stop at an Indian casino.  A man who calls himself the Amazing Hugo works there.  He acts like he doesn't mind T.J.'s presence (perhaps they're old friends) but he instantly rejects Adam.

After Adam tries to impress a woman she drugs and kidnaps him to an upstairs hotel room, numbs his body and sits on top of him in bed.  She wants his kidney!  She even drew his kidney location on his body.  I guess she wasn't kidding when, during the chat the two had downstairs, she said she might be a crazy woman who steals men's kidneys.  Hugo's here as well.  The funniest part is when Adam's scared what these two are going to do to him, and Hugo explains ""We can remove your kidney the back way, but we prefer to scoop it out from the front and let you bleed out after we leave"", LOL!

T.J. and a SUPER hot girl who goes by the name Pocahontas (Rosa Salazar's character) come up with a plan to break Adam out of the hotel room after finding out Hugo and that woman kidnapped him.  Hilarious when Hugo says ""It's just a puppy!"" and T.J. suspecting it's Adam responds with ""Either show us Adam or show us the puppy to prove you're telling the truth!""  They walk to the room next door, head outside to the balcony, jump across using a chair and enter the room to rescue Adam.  Adam tries to jump back across but since he can't feel his arms and legs he falls into the swimming pool below.  Come on T.J., use those arms!  Hugo eventually sees what's going on and shoots an arrow through Adam's numb body.  Adam doesn't feel it!

When T.J. and Adam try to jump in a car and leave the casino parking lot, the Amazing Hugo has a nasty surprise- a triple stacked bow and arrow!  He shoots at the car from the upstairs window, and perhaps the only unfunny and bland moment of the movie comes next.  It's when T.J. jumps out of a burning car (the car's on fire because Hugo's arrow got stuck in it) leaving numb Adam behind.  T.J. stupidly forgot that Adam can't move, so Adam has to wobble out of the car.  T.J. says ""Come on little penguin, you can do it!""  Okay that line's funny, but the way T.J. rescue Adam before the car explodes is really predictable and silly, and the way Adam wobbles looks too silly for words.

Actually let me mention my favorite moment.  This happens earlier before the Indian casino visit when T.J. and Adam find a kid who specializes in making illegal photo identification cards.  T.J. and Adam visit this kid by sneaking into his basement.  They make noise and the mother wakes up.  T.J. and Adam hide behind a curtain but the mom sees their feet.  She opens the curtains and screams at the two intruders!  T.J. tells the mother what her son has been doing making fake ID's for people, but the kid hilariously responds by saying the two men want to take pictures of his balls and that's why they're here, LOL!  The mother goes ballistic, and when they try to drive away a blonde-haired lady who claims to be the second mother (what? LOL!) appears and tries to smash Adam with a brick.  She brings him down to the ground but T.J. comes to the rescue.  Good thing- that would've been one nasty smash!

Anyway eventually T.J. and Adam find Thomas in a Mexican prison, which leads to more chaos since the cops refuse to let him go.  The one cop shows happiness for also licking cocaine off Thomas' face and smiles in embarrassment lol.  T.J. and Adam pretend to fight each other as a way to sneak across the counter and take the gun.  Meanwhile the three drug dealers that Thomas had to deal with earlier show up and start shooting at the prison.  This leads to another action-packed and hilarious segment such as when T.J. shoots what he thinks is a bazooka only to find out it's a net gun, and a donkey gets covered in the net, lol.  The donkey even throws up in disgust!  The guys (and Shannon the wife who's along for the ride, since T.J. and Adam found the hotel she's staying in before finding Thomas in jail in an attempt to apologize for ruining her wedding) cause an explosion that apparently kills the drug dealers.  This scene's weird because it looks like the drug dealers simply disappear, lol.

This is the kind of movie that can be outrageously funny one minute, then has a misfire or two along the way (okay maybe more than two or three times!) but ultimately the movie has enough jokes I highly recommend it.",1497484800,,8421,4.478660538411031
