8148974,5,B000J3EAZ4,"Abel Nightroad is a Cruznik. A vampire that feeds on the blood of other vampires. He is also a clergyman that fights to protect the humans. A organization is out to start a war between humanity and the nations that are ruled by the vampires. Abel and his friends must fight to protect humanity and the vampires from a war that could wipe out both races. Like it almost did 900 years ago.

This anime is beautifully done. The animation and voice acting are great. The soundtrack is pretty cool too. Like all the great animes this story has tons of great characters and very compelling story. There's nothing bad about it. I am shocked to see that there are people out there that didn't like this series. It's certainly different, but not one you'll soon forget.",1354752000,,760,4.547445255474453

8148977,3,B000J3EAZ4,"In this volume of Trinity Blood, the storyline that will dominate the rest of the series begins as the remainder of the main cast is introduced.

In the midst of the tragedy that occured at the end of the last volume, a devestated Abel pulls himself together with help from Esther as AX tries frantically to save Rome from the same fate as Barcelona.  This phase of the series ends with an appropriately muted tone, not forgetting what has already occurred.

Of most interest, however, are the following episodes.  So far, we have only seen malicious, evil Methuselah in spite of mention that others exist.  We now finally meet the two most prominent ""good"" vampires of the series - ""good"" being defined for the purposes of this story as having no wish to harm humans and desire to live in peace.  The first is Asta Duchess of Kiev, a mid-ranking but extremely competent female Methuselah operative who reluctantly teams with Abel on a mission.  The second is Ion Fortuna Earl of Memphis, a young male accompanied by his best friend Radu as bodyguard, who in spite of his inexperience speaks directly as ambassador for the Methuselah Empire hoping for the best but guarding against the worst.  His first impression of humanity is not given a good boost when he has to deal with an assassination attempt almost immediately - and the first human he spends time with turns out to be Methuselah hating Esther.  Sparks fly and the two get off to a less than auspicious start.

Not the best episodes of the series, but the European scenery is still stunning and Asta and Ion add an interesting new element to the mix.",1173571200,2,1611,4.660777385159011
