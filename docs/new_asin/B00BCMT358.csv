5578478,5,B00BCMT358,"I recently purchased the final season of The Gene Autry Show which means now I have all 5 seasons and was very much impressed by the quality and clarity of all episodes. Well done TMG for  restoring these priceless and entertaining TV shows.
  How can I explain the enjoyment I have received from all 85 episodes ? Well just rollicking good fun adventure, comic relief from Pat Buttram and some refreshing cowboy music from Gene himself , what more could I ask for ? And all this at a reasonable price thanks to Amazon. If you purchase these shows you won't be disappointed. Regards Bill.",1379548800,,588,4.580952380952381
5578479,5,B00BCMT358,"This completes the set! How long will these great restored treasures be available? Collect them all while you can, The restoration is well done and the show are most enjoyable. I have bought them all- at this great price!",1376006400,,221,4.6923076923076925
5578480,3,B00BCMT358,I am not writing this review to discourage anyone from buying this. I'm happy that I bought mine. Buy it if you want it! This was on CBS in 1955 with 35mm. prints (Sundays at 5 pm. mst.). Here we have 16mm. syndication prints very poorly mastered. 16mm. can be mastered and look really good...I don't know what happened here! The center and right side are sharply focused...the left is out of focus. The prints are well used and show wear. I'm very critical. The $11 price is right and you probably won't be as hard to please as I am. So go BUY IT.,1375920000,4,548,4.228571428571429

5578482,4,B00BCMT358,this was a nice box set with good info but would not give 5 stars asit is not the best remastering I have seen. The overall presentation  is nice to see these in colour and the sound is ok,1373760000,,188,3.8205128205128207
5578483,4,B00BCMT358,This completes my The Gene Autry Show collection.  It is in color!  He was one of my heroes as I was growing up.  Maybe that is why my generation had a better understanding of good and bad.  If you enjoy The Gene Autry Show this final season is a must for your collection.,1369785600,2,272,4.0754716981132075
5578484,5,B00BCMT358,Another of the Autry produced shows with top quality values and great for the whole family.  Again lots of action and not to much viloence.  Abonus for us fans was the  use of color in the final season letting us see the color of his costumes and great back ground scenery.,1367366400,,273,4.313725490196078
5578485,5,B00BCMT358,"At the end of season one of The Gene Autry Show, in 1951, episodes 25 and 26 were filmed and broadcast in color over CBS using their short lived color system. In season five, the show reverts back to color after seasons 2-4 which were in black and white. Though two of Gene's movies in the late 1940's had been filmed using an inferior film process called Cinecolor, all color shows from seasons 1 and 5 of the television series look very good. Gene now runs a ranch for boys; the stories are still terrific, with superb characters and plenty of action for children of every age.",1361664000,7,579,4.420560747663552

8566206,5,B00BCMT358,"Though I love westerns, I didn't get to see much of Gene Autry when I was a Kid.  That was when we only had two channels to watch on TV.  So now I am making up for all the episodes I missed 60 years ago, and loving each one of them.  These videos are great to watch with the grandkids - something found very rarely with today's media.",1471478400,,334,3.8823529411764706
