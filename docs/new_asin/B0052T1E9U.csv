4530915,5,B0052T1E9U,"This movie begins in 1925 when a family is evicted due to a legal expropriation. Those kids will remember this event for the rest of their lives.

When the end of World War II air-independence begin to emerge along and across the globe, these three brothers Said(James Debbouze), Messaoud(Roschdy Zem) and Abdelkaer(Samu Bouajila) assume key positions of the epic direcccionalidad release.

A superb script, fast narrative pace and fair employment of violence without the usual excessive display of other latitudes, the film takes us into the scenes of these abrasive seventeen years until July 5, 1962.

Rachid Bouchareb (London River) shows his talent once more. In all fairness this film was nominated along with Dog Tooth, Biutiful, In a better world and Incendies, as the  five films that competed at the Academy Award as best foreign film.",1316995200,,845,5.145985401459854

4530917,4,B0052T1E9U,"Writer Director Rachid Bouchareb's first view of the Algerian involvement in France's participation in World War II as the extraordinary DAYS OF GLORY from 2006. Now he continues his story of the bravery of the Algerians in OUTSIDE THE LAW (HORS-LA-LOI) using many of the same actors but placed in different roles.  This is a fast-paced film that covers a lot of territory and time and gives an insider's view of how the Algerian soldiers and the Algerian people struggled post WW II to gain freedom from French colonization. On many levels the films works well: on the level of character development and audience empathy it stumbles - but doesn't fall.

The film opens in 1925 when a family in Algeria faces the French representative who informs a family that the government is taking their ancestral land and home: Le p&egrave;re (Ahmed Benaissa),  La m&egrave;re (Chafia Boudraa) and their three sons Sad, Messaoud and Abdelkader.  Understandably devastated they pack their scant belongings and leave.  Jump to 1945 and the massacre of Setif, an event that forces the family to disperse: La m&egrave;re with Sad (Jamel Debbouze) move to a shantytown for Algerian refugees outside Paris and Sad becomes involved with organized crime in Pigalle to support his mother (he begins as a pimp, then as a Cabaret owner, and moves into more dangerous activities such as fixed boxing matches, etc).  Messaoud (Roschdy Zem) has become a soldier with the French army in the fruitless war in Indochina (Vietnam) and observes as the French retreat that external colonization of a country will always fail because of the inherent patriotism of the indigent people.  Abdelkader (Sami Bouajila), because of this participation in the resistance during the Setif Massacre, has been imprisoned in France where he gains insight from his fellow Algerians that they must revolt and fight to regain independence for Algeria. Once reunited Abdelkadan becomes the driving force behind the Algerian's FLN movement. He is the local figurehead and brains, while his brother Messaoud acts as the muscle and bodyguard. Brother Said continues his pursuit of money through shady night clubs and as a boxing promoter, but he is never far from his brothers' sides - even if he isn't quite as politically motivated.  The film jumps to the 1950s and the early 1960s following the development of the Algerian resistance as it becomes a murderous group, assassinating the French officials and police, engaging in fierce gun battles, all the while under the malicious eye of their nemesis Colonel Faivre (Bernard Blancan). As deaths in the family occur the family dwindles but always with the promise to each other that Algeria will gain its independence, a fact the is revealed through historic film footage from 1962.

The film is a tense reenactment of battles and crime scenes, but there is a problem with the script in detailing the personalities of each of the characters beyond their devotion to Algerian independence.  Even a marriage and the birth of a son and the death of the mother fail to substantially affect the three brothers beyond the expected reactions. The actors are all excellent but without the benefit of a script that allows them to offer us unique and meaningful individuals they become tropes.  As a viewer remembering the brilliance of Days of Glory this film is strangely uninvolving. There is a sense that Rachid Bouchareb feared condemnation by either the Algerians or the French.  Much can be said in favor of that stance: no one is 'right' or 'wrong' in war.  But at movie's end we are left oddly outside the emotional aspect of the film that was the key to the success of Days of Glory. In the end this is a very well made and powerful film that answers many questions about the French Algerian conflict few of us understand.  Grady Harp, July 11",1311379200,5,3843,4.956454121306376

8454366,5,B0052T1E9U,"I enjoyed this middle film. I enjoyed the first film, I hadn't thought about Colonials serving the Mother country's needs and how they were treated afterwards. The first film filled in that void. This film showed the Colonials fighting for what was taken away from them in Algeria, and their struggle in France. Again fleshed out their struggles. Also how the family torn apart, come together. The eldest
served in French Indo China, faces a struggle between fighting France with the struggle to reconcile this struggle with family life.
The three sons struggle with the same crisis with different results. Excellent trilogy. I am looking for the last film. Well researched,
presented, and thought provoking. The character who played the Office in the First film and plays the National Police Officer in the second film, barely provides the French view, but like Gen. de Gaulle, realizes colonialism is a relic of the past. A great movie added to my collection.",1386547200,,961,5.0125

8454368,5,B0052T1E9U,"This film compliments DAYS OF GLORY and the classic THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS well. Algerian brothers starting an anti french colonialism movement on french soil. Good depiction of life during french occupation and algerian migration to the shanty towns of france. Good story, very moving and uplifting. I like how it showed inspiration from the vietnamese victory against french colonialism. It shows french clerical and communist support for algerian independence. And it shows the harsh reality of being an insurgent, you have to literally give yourself to the cause, sacrifice and be selfless, be determined and resolute. Those were the days, before reactionary islamic fundamentalists came on the scene, back then arab insurgents were secular democratic nationalists, and or communists. their cause was legit and you could root for them. I love how they showed real footage of a french victory  over nazi germany parade in the beginning, then at the end show real footage of an algerian victory over france parade.",1335571200,,1015,5.265432098765432
8454369,4,B0052T1E9U,"A family in Algiers is ousted from their generations old farm. It's the 50s and the Algerians are gearing up to break free from their French occupiers. The family moves to a shanty town in Paris. Two of the three brothers get politically involved in the freedom fight, while the third starts out pimping then moves to open a club and start up in fight promoting. The struggle is brutal. People die horrible deaths and the French, who have just got their butts kicked out of Indochina, stoop to some unsavory tactics to try and not let that happen again.

At 2 hours and 18 minutes this is somewhat of an epic. You follow the family in their move from Algiers to Paris and how their lives change and evolve with the political situation over several years. The viewer gets a good idea of what was involved in the fight for freedom along with the tactics used by the French. This is a good watch. Both sides are uncompromising and the Algerians aren't portrayed with halos around their heads. They are as brutal as their occupiers. You get to see the human/ emotional toll it takes on two of the brothers as they are very high up in the resistance. They have no lives outside the resistance and all they know is death.

The acting and production values are all very professional. It all moves at a very steady pace. Somehow it needed a bit more intensity for my dollar and I don't see the need to view it a second time. But for a one time shot this is a very good political thriller.",1321574400,,1480,4.378181818181818

I've been through two of these from Amazon, so far.  I'm giving up and buying the UK blu-ray disc, instead, since I have a multi-region blu-ray player.",1317772800,5,338,4.694915254237288
8454371,4,B0052T1E9U,"This is another offering from French film maker Rachid Bochareb and it is the sequel to the acclaimed `Days of Glory' and indeed stars the same actors. Most notably is Jamel Debbouze as `Said as the youngest brother in the family'. The first part dealt with the African colonial forces that helped France rid herself of Nazi occupation. This takes it a stage further to when those same soldiers fight against France for the self determination of Algeria.

The film is predominantly in French with a fair smattering of Arabic and some pretty good sub titles. It starts in 1925 with the family being thrown off their ancestral land by the French and then takes us on a tour of the many low points for France heading toward the painful birth of Algeria. We even have the massive defeat of the French by the Vietnamese at Dien Bien Phu thrown in. This is not a war movie, even though there is plenty of action, and I have to say it gets the thumbs up for attention to period detail. There are depictions of the massacres that took place in both Algeria and Paris too and the only punches pulled are those in the boxing ring that Said sets up as one of his nefarious money making deals.

It deals with the inter political rivalry of the FLN and the MNA, the two leading and conflicting Algerian parties are shown in their brutal reality. It has a noir feel about it in places and shows the crushing poverty that drives people to do extraordinary things. It is well acted, well directed and beautifully shot. It has been criticised for being anti French, but it is really anti colonial and some might see this as a post revisionist guilt trip, but I think it is a slice of awkward history from Frances' recent past.

The depiction of the para military death squads, extra judicial, executions as well as legitimate ones, show a willingness to really explore the story in all its' facets. A third instalment is planned, but as this did not do as well as `days of Glory' it may be a bit of a wait. Either way you do not need to have seen the first film to get this. I thought it was ruddy good and kept me guessing right up to the end and held my interest through out, I can only recommend",1317772800,4,2181,4.380246913580247
