948665,3,6304960670,"From the Hammer Collection. An original Shaw Bros. Film from HongKong. The DVD comes in 2 version, one on each side of the disc ( US release, and Asian release ). I watch this film when it was originally released in '74,  the color redition is very good. The story is about Count Dracula in  Transylvania who was trapped inside his castle when he was last defeated by  Dr. Van Helsing. At that same instance in China, a Vampiric Cult which  worshipped 7 vampires was also on the rampage. The cult ravage the village  it was in by abducting women whom they literally kill to sustain  themselves. A chinese peasant tried to save his daughter who too was  abducted, but was too late to do so... in the process he killed one of the  7 vampire, but died in the process. The cult slowly desintegrated, and the  monk leading the cult decided to seek help from ...guess who? Count Dracula  in Transylvania. He travelled there, and found Dracula. And Dracula used  him to escape his entombment in the castle. Travelling to China, Dracula  took the role of the monk and revive the vampiric cult. At this time, Dr.  Van Helsing ( Peter Cushing)and his son was in China giving a lecture on  vampirism. He was only taken seriously by a student named Hsi Ching ( David  Chiang ) who coincidentally was the descendant of the peasant who killed  one of the original vampires. He believed in Dr. Van Helsing and wanted the  doctor to help him eradicate the vampires now terrorising his village. The  movie has some exciting Kung-Fu fight scene which have all-together  disappear from the silver screen. This movie brings back some of those  wonderful scene although unrealistic, but certainly worth watching. Unless  you like old Kung-Fu shows, stay away from this one.",930268800,33,1752,4.678688524590164

Combining all those elements together, I just knew I couldn't stay away from this  movie!  I went in expecting it to be extremely cheesy (like most Hammer  films), yet extremely fun to watch (also like most Hammer films).  Needless  to say, I was not disappointed.

948785,2,6304960670,Hammer Films' slow moving horror and squirming nubiles combined with Shaw Studios' brisk martial arts melees. It's an odd and marginally successful combination. Often awkward but with personable stars. Especially funny watching some of the Chinese vampires half-hopping about; apparently they had played Chinese hopping vampires and had a little trouble adapting to the European style. Or maybe it was intentional.,1322179200,,414,5.80327868852459

948787,1,6304960670,"I was so glad when on a whim one day I noticed that old Hammer horror titles previously released by Anchor Bay Entertainment appeared to be getting a re-release. Boy, was I wrong about that! Don't be fooled. DVD-R's are no substitute for a real factory manufactured product. The pictures appear murky, bleeding and washed out even though its obviously a direct burn from a genuine Anchor Bay DVD. The sound drops in and out. I played each disc on 3 different players manufactured by 3 different companies. In all I wasted $20 dollars a piece on 3 of these pathetic knock offs. Originally when I purchased these titles there was NO mention of them being bootleg quality DVD-R's. I don't know who's ingenious idea it was to propose such a gross misuse of wasted effort. Either shame on Anchor Bay or shame on Amazon for perpetuating such poor quality knock offs at such an absurd price. They even use the original Anchor Bay DVD's cover art printed by a laser printer however most of the special features listed will not appear.

I.E. - The Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires does not include the U.S. cut of the film as mentioned.

What a crime in itself either release the film correctly or don't bother at all. What a tease. What a waste of my money and time.

The movie had this been a genuine product released through Anchor Bay would've received 5 stars.

I threw my money away on:

Dracula Prince Of Darkness

Frankenstein Created Woman

The Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires

Save your money until somebody with half a brain decides to do the right things with the old deleted Hammer titles. I'm still very dissatisfied with this scenario.",1260316800,7,1640,4.592465753424658

948790,4,6304960670,"I love the 1974 flick titled Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (or possibly the 7 Brothers Meet Dracula if you're more familiar with the shorter version with some alternate editing.) I'd been meaning to see this flick for awhile (after hearing Ben and Dan talk about it on the Mondo Movie podcast), and recently I got a chance to sit back and watch the very odd pairing of two cult movie studios, Hammer and the Shaw Brothers. Yeah, I know what you're thinking, how exactly do you mesh kung fu and horror? I was skeptical too, but after watching it I have to say that these two go together like chocolate and peanut butter.

I don't have a ton of experience with either studio's work though I have seen a few films by each and I've really liked everything I've seen so far. Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires was Hammer's shot at trying to breathe some new life into the studio, aiming to cash in on the burgeoning popularity of kung fu cinema in the 70s. The film was written by Don Houghton (who had penned some episodes of Doctor Who as well as a few other Hammer films) and directed by Roy Ward Baker (who was also part of the Hammer stable of creators), though it's also been noted that Shaw's most prolific and well known filmmaker Chang Cheh also worked on the film.

We get the basic gist of what's to follow as Kah, a Chinese monk on a quest, begs Dracula to help him awaken the legendary seven golden vampires so that he can take control of a province in China. Dracula refuses, and instead decides to take over Kah's body and so that he himself can return to rule over China and eventually the world.

Honestly this film should be a horrible disaster as right off the bat there are a ton of conflicting story holes, not to mention that the film relies heavily on the films that have come before it, but I still couldn't help smiling with glee throughout the whole thing. The insanely colorful lighting, the corny dialogue, the interesting though pretty sub-par effects work, it all mashes up into a wonderful hour and a half of crazy monsters and fun kung fu action...

Peter Cushing reprises his role as Professor Van Helsing, though this time he's traveling through China in 1904 in hopes of enlightening the local Universities with his knowledge of the undead.  What surprised me a little was how much Cushing wasn't doing, action-wise. If there was one thing that I noticed about Cushing's performances in the other Hammer films I've watched (Curse of Frankenstein, the Horror of Dracula, Hound of the Baskervilles and Night Creatures), it is how amazingly action packed his roles have been. When chasing down Dracula, the man is jumping on tables, running and tumbling everywhere, so different from his turn as Grand Moff Tarkin in Star Wars. In Lo7GV Cushing pretty much kept to the background as soon as any fights broke out (of course, he was 61 or so at the time, but still.)

What's kind of weird is that this whole movie sort of negates Helsing's battles with Dracula in the other Hammer films, as the character supposedly disappeared from Transylvania in order to travel to China to awaken the seven golden vampires. Even though there are giant plot holes, this is still one of the most enjoyable vampire flicks I've ever seen.",1244678400,6,3245,4.56701030927835
948791,4,6304960670,"This movie was great. If your a fan of the old school horror movies,you will enjoy this. Peter Cushing delivers a great performance as always,and it's just a good movie.",1241136000,4,169,4.666666666666667
948792,5,6304960670,"An extravagant claim but one I'm gonna endeavor to back up.

'Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires' is the last horror picture Peter Cushing made for Hammer - and he's magnificent. He plays Van Helsing, (yes.. honest!)and to his eternal credit he looks believably close to tears every time he utters an emotionally-charged line like: ""In Europe it is the crucifix, in Asia, the image of the Lord Buddha"".
I adore Peter Cushing anyway, and to see him in any film is good for me but to see him in a work of this magnitude and gravitas is a real treat. He must be lying there now, thinking about his 50-odd year career, each performance building up to: ""My knowledge is restricted to the Western Hemisphere"".
Strangely, there's not much in Peter Cushing's autobiography about 'LOT7GV' which is unfathomable.

Julie Ege is the female lead; a Scandinavian buxom-vamp fresh from her Oscar-nominated role as Voluptua in 'Up Pompeii-the Movie'; (""There's no decorum/ in the forum/and they're quite at home in the hippy-drome, you can chose who you prefer/'coz Ben Him looks like Ben HER!!"") and the biting satire-twins 'Not Now Darling' and 'Rentadick'.
One disreputable publication described her performance as 'a pair of t*ts with a Swedish accent', just goes to show that however much genuine talent you have, you can never drag the gutter press erm..out of the gutter. (!)

Robin Stewart plays the 'young hero' role. He's a classically trained comedy actor, mostly seen with Sid 'Sir' James in the abject Brit-Com 'Bless This House' and wearing a kaftan in the Michael Armstrong 60's slasher: 'the Haunted House of Horror' - a gory travesty with Frankie Avalon and Mark Wynter(yes.. honest!).
Viewing Stewart's performance as Leyland van Helsing (a FANTASTIC analogy with the Bolshevic-run 1970's car giant British Leyland, whose workers spent the whole decade on pointless strike) it's easy to criticise, but he is in fact showing 'solidarity' with his lion-hearted co-unionists. This is breathtakingly poignant and relevant; it's not every-one that can fight 50 heavily armed kung-fu zombie vagabonds with the conviction of a house-brick. 'Red' Ron and all the other commies back in Blighty held out at their braziers for another year on the strength of Stewart's subtly and deftly understated showing.

Count Dracula, present in every scene and the central evil core of the movie, is played by John Forbes Robertson in the campest make-up in British cinema - all pinks, greens, bat-eyebrows and lipstick. Much criticised among the unknowing (described in another disreputable publication (not really - it was the same one!) as a 'pantomime dame'), but it put me in mind of Olivier's Oberon in 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'(another - slightly lesser - work of feminism and sexual ambiguity) and JFR's performance as one of British literature and world cinema's most recognisable and serious characters, just HAS to be experienced:
As the villain he has all the best lines: ""A curse on you and your house!"" ""I am Dracula; Lord of Darkness, Master of the Vampires, Prince of the Undead, Ruler of the Damned!"" (yes.. honest!)  and ""Right!  van Helsing - you will once more see my face... before you die! Behold van Helsing - look on me, now."" You'll fill up - as I did - at the magisterial impact of it all.

Music is by James Bernard, re-jigging themes from his previous scores, and even here 'LOT7GV' wins. Not many blockbusters were recycling in the wasteful, excessive 70's. The Bond movies for example, had Sir Roger Moore flying all over the world, inadvertently ruining it. So well done Hammer!

The plot is so sophisticated and progressive, no-one can understand it. Unkindly scorn holds sway. Stupid critics pathetically concentrate on the appalling special effects(post-modernism); atrocious action (satirical slapstick) and the cavernous holes in the script(delicious irony) as justification of universal condemnation. How wrong can you be?

The '7' of the title also refers to van Helsing's companions; 6 lads and a girl heading to their remote village to destroy '7' vampires that have plagued them for centuries and this is where the feminism and sexual ambiguity comes in.
The 'sister' can fight kung-fu nearly as good as the men (yes.. honest) in a film set in 1904(!) and only dies when she weakens for love. What a gal. Rest easy Emily; it seems chaining your bra to the railings wasn't for nothing after all.

Director Roy Ward Baker claims his masterpiece was flawed by studio interference (In this instance, co-financiers the Shaw Brothers; based in Hong Kong and who know nothing about making martial arts movies). They should've just let the ex-English public school prefect to his vision, he was obviously so in-tune with the aesthetics of the medium, their pettiness could easily have ruined the film.

'LOT7GV' is deliberately hysterical. Some beautiful, screaming girls with their breasts revealed as they lie strapped down next to a bubbling cauldron of blood, is vital to the plot in a real sense, as well as the abstract that Ward Baker is delicately invoking. Tears rolled down my cheeks as the scene unfolded, so moved was I by its multi-layered intensity and relativism.

So you see, there can be no doubt as to the claims of 'LOT7GV'. I've only scratched the surface here - the action sequences seriously challenge Kurosawa and the terror, so originally and tensely conveyed, is as full-blooded and awesome as any Jacobean tragedy.
Acting is Welles-perfection and production is refreshingly minimalist and compact.
Much like '2001', 'Once Upon a Time in the West' or 'Jaws'; the locations are so visual and forceful, you feel like you're actually there in Szechwan Province with Peter and the boys, vanquishing vampires and returning the world to safety and contentment.

And isn't it wonderful that since Hammer/Baker's uber-treatise on cultural bonding and the futility of violence was released in 1974, there hasn't been a single war.

Now, you tell me, could anything but the greatest film ever made do that?",1226707200,8,6034,5.045180722891566
948793,3,6304960670,"The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires is a less than successful hybrid combining Hammer horror and mid-70s chop socky movie as Dracula (not Christopher Lee but an inadequate John Forbes Robertson), for reasons never really explained, possesses the body of a Chinese bad guy to control six golden vampires while Cushing's Van Helsing, on a far from successful Chinese lecture tour, finds himself teaming up with seven brothers and their one sister to rid a remote Chinese village of yada yada yada.. ""Black belt against black magic"" screams the trailer, and while it's not as poor as I recalled, the only things going for it are a few okay action scenes and a magnificent display of bosom heaving from Julie Ege in one particularly memorable shot.

But it's a masterpiece compared to the butchered US version, retitled The Seven Brothers Meet Dracula, which makes it sound like a bad Howard Keel musical. Although the original was far from dialog-heavy, a good two-thirds of the dialog has been dropped completely (in some cases you can still see the actors' lips moving but no sound emerging). Even more bizarre is the opening two reels, which reuse much of the same footage three times in a row in three separate scenes, hoping that by flipping it around no-one will notice. The end result is a surreal experience that just washes over you.

Anchor Bay's extras package is particularly good: both cuts of the film, the US trailer (which the narrator constantly refers to as 'The Seven Brothers and Their One Sister Meet Dracula'!) and the old LP narrated by Peter Cushing as an audio extra. However, the double-bill set with Frankenstein Created Woman is a better bet than this individual release/",1204675200,,1696,4.865051903114187
948794,3,6304960670,"I think this was an interesting idea given the time the film was made to link the horror and KungFu genres. Apparently there were many problems involved with the shooting of a European film in Hong Kong, at the Shaw Brothers studios. Despite these problems the film is good visually, and is reminiscent of the earlier Hammer 'Dracula' films.

The acting standard is about average, with the customary excellent performance from Peter Cushing in the pivotal role. Sadly missing from the cast is Chris Lee; John ForbesRobertson is hopelessly miscast as Dracula. This problem is not helped by the poor Dracula make-up, which often got laughs in the cinema.

Thankfully Dracula doesn't appear too often in the film, and it may have been improved if they had cut him out altogether! Convincing performances are delivered by all of the Chinese cast. The golden vampires are impressive (and were a good, original idea), in their golden masks and medallions, etc.

Another, possibly intentional, humorous touch are the zombies. They appear to virtually hop around everywhere in a very comical manner. Les Bowie's special effects are marvelous, especially the resurrection scenes (somewhat similar in nature to the sequence in 'Plague of the Zombies').

Julie Ege is enticing as the film's loveinterest. David Chiang (who had previously worked with Bruce Lee) plays the leader of the brothers well, and has only a slight accent. His KungFu techniques are highly convincing.

Totally mixcast is Robin Stewart (a British TV comedy 'actor') as Van Helsing's inept son Leyland. His style of acting appears to come from the 'oakschool', and his presence always seems to detract from the atmosphere of the film.

The movie is beautifully crafted by the consistently amazing Roy ward Baker (the style recalls memories of his earlier 'Vampire Lovers'). Even without the KungFu this would have stood alone as a good horror film. The MartialArts aspect complements the film, and it amply deserves its cult classic status.

Sadly the film didn't receive its deserved widerelease after completion in 1974. It has only been around the UK film circuit a couple of times since then, usually on the lower half of an inferior doublebill. It took five years to be released in the States, with a ridiculous title change. However, it has still managed to become a cult film.

Only a butchered version was available in America. Most Hammer fans avidly sit through this film many times whenever it makes one of it's rare screen appearances.

It was one of the old Hammer company's last attempts at a comeback to the horror genre, the other being 'To the devil, a daughter' in 1975. Neither film was financially successful enough to keep the company above water, so that further movies could be made.

One great asset of the film is the superb score by James Bernard and Phil Martell. (A story read by Peter Cushing with some music is available on an exceedingly rare soundtrack LP.) As an exmartial artist I feel that the KungFu sections were of a high enough standard to satisfy fans of that particular genre, as well as the straight horror fans. KungFu films were extremely popular in 1974/5 following the Bruce Lee movies.

It makes a pleasant change to see vampires being killed by the use of unusual weapons and fighting methods (the fight scenes were always actionpacked and highly exciting), rather than the traditional  run into the ground  stakes, crosses, garlic, etc.

On subsequent viewings the film holds up well and never becomes boring, audiences never seem to tire when watching it. It's a great shame that this film is virtually the only one of its kind, being a most agreeable blend of differing film styles.

Despite the minor flaws of Dracula and Leyland, Roy Ward Baker is to be commended on the construction of an atmospheric and enjoyable film; a fitting tribute to the skill and craftsmanship of the Hammer cast and crew.",1175644800,2,3913,4.9435975609756095
948834,2,6304960670,"This Hammer attempt to capture the new kung-fu market, which was expanding in the early 1970's thanks to the auspices of the Shaw Production team, is a failure. Hammer fans were growing up and the studio did not attempt to make more mature pictures, instead they saw their numbers dwindle even more by teaming up the Dracul legend with Kung-Fu action set in Peiking. Most of Hammer's audience was now watching 70's porn which showed more than the mere bulging breasts that Hammer had given fans in the 1960's. Peter Cushing is once again back as the mad professor Van Hesling and he is giving a lecture on vampires in China.

The mood is mysterious but there is never really any strong plot to get the viewer interested, instead we get terrible kung fu action sequences, mixed with cheap sword play. One example is the Englishman who is fighting off 8 dead zombies, he doesnt know how to fight and yet he is beating off the gruesome creatures! The only thing that is good to say is that the vampires are a cheap mixture of Italian special effects which aren't that bad, almost bordering on the Dead Knights Templars series which had been a hit in Spain.

(UK/Hong Kong - 1974)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

Whilst lecturing in Chungking at the turn of the 20th century, Professor Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) is asked by a poor villager (David Chiang) to help defend his community from a plague of vampires controlled by Count Dracula (John Forbes-Robertson).

Filmed on location in Hong Kong under extremely difficult circumstances, this Hammer/Shaw Bros. co-production attempts to meld the antiquated Gothic melodrama of Hammer's bygone glories with the new breed of kung fu thrillers which had recently been popularized by the worldwide success of KING BOXER (1971) - known in the US as 5 FINGERS OF DEATH - and, especially, ENTER THE DRAGON (1973). Roy Ward Baker (THE VAMPIRE LOVERS) took the reins from original director Gordon Hessler (THE OBLONG BOX) after only a few days, though his work was clearly hampered from the outset by co-producer Don Houghton's simplistic script, which describes events either in broad strokes or hasty scribbles, leaving most of the actors in disarray.

Cushing is urbane as ever, trading successfully on his established screen persona, but co-star Julie Ege (a former Bond girl) is merely decorative, while Chiang - an accomplished screen actor (also known as John Keung Tai-wei) whose work stretches all the way from STREET BOYS in 1960 to THE ADVENTURERS (1995) and beyond - is ultimately defeated by the English dialogue, which he's forced to deliver in a stilted, phonetic style. Robin Stewart (THE HAUNTED HOUSE OF HORROR) and Shih Szu are also featured as the juvenile leads, alongside hugely prolific actors Fung Hak-on (later a regular in Jackie Chan's movies) and Lau Kar-wing (an experienced performer and director in his own right).

Elsewhere, Forbes-Robertson does a fair impersonation of Christopher Lee in Dracula-mode, though his first on-screen appearance is almost ruined by a comical makeup design. Feeble special effects by Les Bowie, too. That said, however, the studio sets are appropriately vivid, and the widescreen Panavision photography (by John Wilcox and Roy Ford) makes a virtue of Johnson Tsau's atmospheric art direction - watch for the haunting image in Dracula's castle of ghostly shadows billowing softly on a multicolored wall just before the Count begins to stir from his coffin - and the fight sequences (arranged by veteran choreographers Liu Chia-liang and Tang Chia) are lively and energetic.",1025049600,37,2486,5.2969543147208125

Set in turn-of-the-century China, ""The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires"" (1974) delivers plenty of chop-socky action with the occasional blood-sucking chills. Peter Cushing makes the most of his final go-round as Van Helsing and even participates in the climactic melee. However, it's easy to see why Christopher Lee ended his vampiric reign after 1973's ""The Satanic Rites of Dracula"" (John Forbes-Robertson takes over the role in a mercifully brief cameo). Despite the Count's unnecessary presence, this wild hybrid emerged as Hammer's best chiller of the 1970s. By all means avoid the dreadful American re-edit: ""The 7 Brothers Meet Dracula.""",1428624000,,728,5.451327433628318

7880657,2,6304960670,"This Hammer attempt to capture the new kung-fu market, which was expanding in the early 1970's thanks to the auspices of the Shaw Production team, is a failure. Hammer fans were growing up and the studio did not attempt to make more mature pictures, instead they saw their numbers dwindle even more by teaming up the Dracul legend with Kung-Fu action set in Peiking. Most of Hammer's audience was now watching 70's porn which showed more than the mere bulging breasts that Hammer had given fans in the 1960's. Peter Cushing is once again back as the mad professor Van Hesling and he is giving a lecture on vampires in China.

The mood is mysterious but there is never really any strong plot to get the viewer interested, instead we get terrible kung fu action sequences, mixed with cheap sword play. One example is the Englishman who is fighting off 8 dead zombies, he doesnt know how to fight and yet he is beating off the gruesome creatures! The only thing that is good to say is that the vampires are a cheap mixture of Italian special effects which aren't that bad, almost bordering on the Dead Knights Templars series which had been a hit in Spain. If you have nothing else to do, go ahead and see this but don't expect more than a few moments of interest.",1387411200,,1261,4.506550218340611

7880659,5,6304960670,"Immediately after the release of THE SATANIC RITES OF DRACULA, Hammer began producing another Dracula film intended to star both Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.  However Lee was not very pleased with the direction his immortal character was taking, especially after the box office failures of both DRACULA A.D. and THE SATANIC RITES OF DRACULA, therefore he decided to bow out from this project, which was a shame since this film managed to maintain more of a Gothic atmosphere over the previous two films.

Hammer proceeded with production despite Lee's decision, replacing the actor with John Forbes Robertson as Dracula.  The film was a co-production between Hammer and the Shaw Brothers of Hong Kong, since Warner decided not to be involved in the Dracula series after the poor box office returns generated by DRACULA A.D.  One of the the stipulations in the agreement was that there had to be some kind of martial arts combat footage introduced into the subplot.  The result was Count Dracula Meets Kung Fu!

The film takes place in the Orient where the legendary Seven Golden Vampires ride across the screen mounted on their demonic horses armed with swords, evil spirits and an army of mindless zombies; all of which fall under the command of Count Dracula himself!  Its fast-paced, exciting, AND has likeable, believable, and interesting characters.  The take on the 'Golden Vampires' is a fresh and original idea, and the idea of them serving a 'warlord' necromancer type adds to the flavor.  Their undead zombie minions - while laughable at times - add a great element that enhances the martial arts scenes, and Cushing's Van Helsing is as inspiring as ever!

We are only ever treated to two scenes with Forbe's Dracula - at the very beginning and at the very end.  Both are well done, if not a bit campy.

In the film, Dracula has now taken on the physical identity of an Oriental Warlord, and under his new disguise, he deceives the people of the Orient.  Meanwhile, professor Van Helsing (Cushing) ventures to the Far East to investigate rumors of a vampiric nature in the form of the Seven Golden Vampres, where he winds up confronting his life-long nemesis, Count Dracula.  Once again, the two foes face off in another battle, while around them their allies fight in pitched combat using all the pizazz that one would expect from a martial arts film.  It is only at the end of the film that Dracula drops his disguise and reveals himself to the professor.

Had Hammer invested more into this film, the outcome could have been more exciting; as it is, it is a great film; complete with vampires, zombies, martial arts, and even a relatively decent plot.  I have long since been a fan of this movie, and will continue to be one for a long time to come.

Five Stars for this one, says I.",1332979200,2,2802,4.7541322314049586
7880660,4,6304960670,"I first saw this ,ovie under its other title, Seven Brothers Versus the Seven Golden Vampires.  The attraction here is the marriage between Hammer horror and Chinese martial arts films.  The result is quite effective and scary.  The zombie addition helps raise the horror quotient.  I enjoyed rewatching this horror film.  Peter Cushing lends his talents in this tingling tale of vampirism in rural China.",1324425600,,405,5.1692307692307695
