Many of these shorts center around consumerism, like buying a house or going to the mall. They do however capture the flavor of those times, or at least, how we would like to remember them. In one short, the perfect mom makes chicken salad while in full make-up and a lovely dress. I also particularly liked Dateline Long Island, as that's were I grew up. Sigh! Those days a re long gone.",1306972800,2,532,4.2254901960784315
