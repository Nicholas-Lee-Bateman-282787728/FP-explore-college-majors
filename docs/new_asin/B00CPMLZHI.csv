5732562,1,B00CPMLZHI,The DVD sent was a terrible copy. The Youtube version was much better! At least you could read the words and hear the sound. I think it was a copy not an original.,1376956800,,163,3.9696969696969697
5732563,5,B00CPMLZHI,"[COMMENT BEFORE OWNING DVD] This movie looks very promising. Looking forward to owning it. It's not very often that good, solid fantasy movies get released.
[COMMENT AFTER OWNING DVD] [May contain mild spoilers; nothing too revealing.] As an independent filmmaker, my review will be a little more on the technical side. The movie is... very high res. It's nicely done. The color grading is exceptional. The world is convincing. Make-up was also very well done. Wardrobe was decent. For anyone heavily into fantasy movies (specifically sword/dragon), this is a must watch movie. It's worthy to be owned, but this is one of those movies where you only need watch it once. One and done. . Acting is slightly above average. Direction and cinematography was ok. VFX was ok. It's not over done. They mix a bit of CGI in with some Jim Henson-ish design. I liked that. Dialogue wasn't horrible. Character development was pretty poor. This can really kill a movie. Storyline was seriously flat. It's not a memorable movie like Willow; where the characters are likable and unforgettable. No one in this movie was really likable. The best character was the dwarf, and he played a small role. It just seemed to me that everyone hated everyone else. So many directors do this. No body wants to see people hating one another. There's a difference between characters struggling with something that affects the theme, but these characters just seemed to not have good chemistry. I can see what the director was trying to do, but the delivery was ""eh"" at best. All in all. If you love fantasy, it's a must-watch. It's a contemporary film. If you are not swayed by fantasy films either way, this movie's a coin toss. I still give this movie 5 stars. But that's because I am biased to fantasy films. There's just not enough of them out there.",1376784000,,1823,4.79047619047619

8584558,4,B00CPMLZHI,"Eager for some new low-budget high fantasy, I ordered a Blu-ray version from Amazon's UK site for dirt cheap. Chagrintastically, I then discovered this film already in my collection under a different name, so...
As a public service announcement, let's clear up any confusion right here:

(original title) -- SAGA: Curse of the Shadow

UK (English title) (DVD box title) -- Rise of the Shadow Warrior

USA (alternative title) (English title) -- Curse of the Dragon Slayer

USA (alternative title) (English title) -- Dragon Lore: Curse of the Shadow

USA (English title) (new title) -- SAGA: Curse of the Shadow

World-wide (alternative title) (English title) -- SAGA: The Shadow Cabal

If I were feeling cynical this evening I would say a crafty filmmaker changed the name around to cause absentminded geeks like me to purchase the same flick twice. Maybe it was changed to have ""dragon"" in the title because ""dragon"" is a choice marketing term for this genre, but then they got sued by somebody and changed the name back to something about shadows?
Below, I'm just going to refer to it as ""Curse"" (short for ""SAGA: Curse of the Dragon Lore Slayer Shadow Cabal,"" or alternatively, ""Curse of the Many-named Movie"").

So is it worth watching? That depends on your viewing needs. Here are some details:

*Cinematography*
OUTSTANDING. Somebody cut their teeth with Curse, and Hollywood may take notice and scoop up the talent involved. Granted, Utah is intrinsically beautiful, but it still takes talent to scout out the perfect spot and to use camera angles that will make the most of natural splendor. The topography caught on film is lavishly varied, with forests, wetlands, and plenty of mountainous terrain. Going above and beyond the call of duty for a B movie, they even bothered to do some underwater scenes (featuring mermaids who curiously wear bikini tops made of synthetic material). On top of this, serious color grading during postproduction resulted in saturated landscapes and artificial darkness to provide for an otherworldly vibe.

*Actors*
""They cursed the wrong elf, and they're going to regret it,"" says Nemyt Akaia. Because she is just so damn telegenic that I don't want to imagine this flick without her, I'm reluctant to admit that Danielle Chuchran as the elf named Nemyt was perhaps miscast. According to IMDb, Danielle was ""born in Upland, California but moved to Utah shortly after."" Upland is dangerously close to actual Valley Girl territory, and at times you can't help but think of Nemyt Akaia as being a California elf. Anyway, she was competent in her scenes, and there's something oddly alluring about a girl like that who can spit so well (her elf spits at whomever she's currently disgusted with, which changes frequently). According to the final credits she had a body double, but humorously she also served as a ""Booty Double"" for the treacherous mermaids.
I will be seeking out Danielle Chuchran in leading roles elsewhere, and I selfishly hope that she doesn't gain fame and leave the B movie circuit.

Curse was Richard McWilliams' screen debut, and Richard did very well indeed as the protagonist Keltus the Wanderer.
Paul D. Hunt, who already had experience on the screen, also brings life to Curse as the frenemy orc Kullimon the Black, and he deserves extra credit for wearing what must have been uncomfortable facial prosthetics.

The stunning Bailee MyKell Cowperthwaite (she'll need to change her name if she wants to be a starlet) plays the prophetess, although by ""plays"" I mean she stands there looking solemn (nice work if you can get it) while another woman does her telepathic voice. Come to think of it, Bailee looks more like she belongs on the cover of Vogue than in a movie overflowing with orcs.

*Plot / Script*
Not mind-bending in the least, but if we're going to be charitable we can say it goes beyond simplistic and keeps the audience engaged. I'm just glad there was no actual ring involved, keeping Curse from being The Frenemies of the Ring (since it borrows so much from FotR already). The dialogue was written by two dudes who make it abundantly clear that Curse is concerned with genre and cinematography over launching the career of a screenwriter.

*Soundtrack*
A bit grandiloquent for a B movie, but I'd rather hear ambition than afterthought. Well done.

*Special Effects / CGI*
Hit or miss, but mostly adds to the credibility of Curse rather than detracting from it. There was a big fail in attempting to portray an undead minotaur (or demon or something) that had papier-mch hands, but that was the only disaster.

Family friendly? Well, if you are fine with your kid witnessing multiple decapitations but can't abide bare breasts on mermaids, then you've come to the right place. The mermaids are fully clothed and there are plenty of melee scenes that end with heads flying off.

Final thoughts: Somewhat superior to the Mythica film series, Curse is amusing if you're willing to overlook obvious but expected low-budget flaws... would have been a lot less fun without Danielle Chuchran as the valley girl elf.",1446336000,3,5086,4.950704225352113
8584559,5,B00CPMLZHI,Incredible movie. Some of the most beautiful scenery you will ever see is in this film  the 3 lead actors give fine performances. The makeup and special effects are pretty impressive for a low budget film.,1443916800,,205,4.694444444444445
8584560,1,B00CPMLZHI,"Excellent film, but subtitles!!! Don't have subtitles and is for latinamerica?",1408320000,,78,6.181818181818182
8584561,2,B00CPMLZHI,"What I got was the same exact movie that was  ""Curse of the Dragon Slayer"". I don't know if this was a mistake by the DVD manufacturer or the producer, but my understanding is there is a Dragon Lore Trilogy, and this is supposed to be part of the trilogy, not the same exact movie as ""Curse of the Dragon Slayer"". I don't want to accuse anyone of deceptive practices, but it was disappointing. I was going to return it but one of my cousin's kids wanted the mislabeled DVD  because he had seen a movie trailer of Curse of the Dragon Slayer.",1405036800,4,540,4.233009708737864
8584562,5,B00CPMLZHI,"To say this is an ""obvious ripoff"" of lord of the rings is a bit unfair.  Tolkien didn't by any means INVENT elves, rangers nor even dragons.  I'll give him halflings, but much of what is available in the fantasy genre was not invented by him.  Are Indians ripping off the west by eating Naan while the westerners ate bread?  Were the Beatles ripping off Donovan because he taught them some clawing guitar pick techniques and were in the same genre early on in their careers? This film is based on the lore of Saga, which was a frankly awesome computer game a few years back (it's still available and is free now).  It combined Warcraft strategy style with a collectible card game (used to attain more troops, or you could buy them in game for resources like gold, stone, wood etc) and other than being a fantasy setting wasn't really a ripoff of LOTR.  Dwarves for example were mechanically minded in nature and had invented several machines that had similar functions to that of the more magically minded races.  Look up the Saga game and see some of the differences in the lore of that world before just labeling a blatant LOTR ripoff.",1404950400,4,1138,4.549019607843137
8584563,2,B00CPMLZHI,"This review is for contents of only the movie.

This movie has several titles.  IMDB has this listed as Saga: Curse of the Shadow.  It is a straight out rip-off from J.R.R. Tolkien and the Lord of the Rings trilogy using an Elf, an Orc and a human.  The three, tentative comrades, working together to take down the baddie.  All three must battle personal demons, more orcs and ocassionally each other to wind up the story line.

One obvious bonus, the movie was shot in Utah lending an absolutely stunning background which is worthy of a far better movie than this.  Even the acting here was hesitant, occassionally forced and often contrived.",1404518400,,643,4.6875
8584564,3,B00CPMLZHI,"Nemyt Akaia (Danielle Chuchran) is a fiery elf who is a bounty hunter. She kills an orc and gets cursed. Keltus (Richard McWilliams) is a human wanderer because ranger has been already taken in LOTR. Nemyt has a strong natural resistance to the curse. This allows her to travel among the orcs and fallen elves. In addition to attempting to get the curse removed, it seems the whole world is about to come to an end with the release of the Shadow Lord or ""he who which we don't speak."" There are also dwarfs in this film who swap their allegiance to the orcs.

Yes, if you haven't figured it out, they did some wholesale stealing from LOTR including a night rider and several scenes that didn't involve more than 10 people. While the story boasts a shadow curse, it was a little light on dragons, as in none. If you are going to put dragon in the title you have to do more than talk about them and have them in one scene. The make up was pretty decent. Our elf wore cheap light blue contacts, but it looked good with her handlebar ears. The fighting choreography was noticeably bad in a few scenes. There were also too many poorly lite night time scenes. Kids should like it.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, nudity. Filmed in scenic Utah.",1388793600,,1239,4.406113537117904
8584565,5,B00CPMLZHI,"If you are a fantasy lover - you'll love this film. The story line drives you ever onward, but it's in the effects where they shine the most - truly epic & amazing. The acting is well done and enjoyable.
To know this is an ""indie"" film is the best part of all - doesn't feel like it.

Well done guys!",1387411200,2,300,3.918032786885246
8584566,5,B00CPMLZHI,"I got the DVD for this from the kickstarter.  I was impressed with the quality of the special effects, and costumes and the story was great.

The movie drops you in the world and let's the world reveal itself organically through the story rather then spoon feeding you with needless exposition.  Looking forward to more from this studio.",1378080000,3,337,4.775862068965517
