7808957,5,6301015460,"The KISS ""Crazy Nights"" video is a video all KISS fans should check out.  While ""Lick it Up"" and ""Animalize"" were the best non-makeup 80's albums KISS released, ""Crazy Nights"" still rocked.  So it is defintely a thrill to own three videos for ""Crazy, Crazy Nights"", ""Turn On The Night"", and ""Reason to Live"" all on one cassette.  All of the videos and the songs were great, and the girl who was in the ""Reason to Live"" video was a total babe, and so was the one in the ""Turn On The Night"" video.",1097193600,3,495,4.24468085106383
7808958,1,6301015460,Don't waste your money.  This video is only about 12 minutes long with three videos.,1076716800,,84,4.6
7808959,5,6301015460,"Hoo! 3 of the best songs on Crazy Nights! Turn on the Night and Crazy Nights focuses on live footage with the big 50 foot multipowered logo behind them and reason to live showcases a girl with a nice way of revenge >:) 13 bucks is too much, but check it out.",1005004800,,258,3.980769230769231

7808961,5,6301015460,"All three of the videos from KISS are awesome 80's music video gems! Of the three, Reason To Live is the greatest one! The song, written by Paul Stanley and Desmond Child, is (in my opinion) their greatest song ever....and is, yes, like KISS' big hit: Beth....another ballad....but just listen to the words and music....absolutely incredible!!!! It makes me feel very good to be alive, every time I hear it! :) The video is stunning and gives the song a memorable picture each time it's heard on my Crazy Nights CD. The other 2 music videos: Crazy Crazy Nights and Turn On The Night are full throttle rockers that show the band electrifying in concert and charging up the crowd! I can't wait until these music videos find their way to a KISS video compilation DVD....it sure will sell alot of copies!",982368000,5,800,4.640845070422535
7808962,4,6301015460,"Three videos from the 1987 Album CRAZY NIGHTS...hence the title.  (Imagine that.)  The videos are good, I just wish there were more of them.",973814400,,140,4.791666666666667
