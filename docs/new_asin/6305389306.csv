8638220,5,6305389306,"For those of you who have not been introduced into the VR5 world this series was originally created in 1995 by acclaimed executive producer/writer/director John Sacret Young (""China Beach"") and co-producer Thania St. John (""Life Goes On""). The series is about the daughter of a neurobiologist who has apparently lived through a tramatic experience of losing her father and sister. She is haunted by the memories of ""the accident"" and somehow she stumbles in her dealings with computers upon the Virtual Reality world. The main character Sydney Bloom played by Lori Singer is able to bring a person into the computer into a visual world she creates and both her subconscious and that of the person she brings in are brought into play. The other person never remembers the experience. The five levels of VR 5 are VR.1: Computer Screen  VR.2: Interactive Video Game  VR.3: Flight Simulator  VR.4: Cyber Space  VR.5: Virtual Sensory Reality
In the Pilot the show introduces Sydney Bloom a mild mannered TelCal worker and a lonely soul.  Her only escape is through the use of her computer fitting when she taps into the VR world that she feels free and her confidence changes.  Her only friend seems to be Duncan (Michael Easton) whom seems to be a street person with a vast array of knowledge.  Upon stumbling into the VR world she goes to Dr. Frank Morgan (Will Patton) who tells her to stop what she's doing before it's too late.  This episode guest stars Penn Jillette as Kravitz and Adam Baldwin as her co-worker Scott Cooper whom seems to have a shady past.  Enjoy!!",986860800,18,1567,4.795539033457249
8638221,4,6305389306,"This particular double episode is typical of all the series of VR 5. It is  excellent. I was a fan when it aired on FOX television and was blessed when  I saw the soundtrack in a price slasher bin in a suburban Philadelphia  store. Years later it began to air on the SCI-FI channel and I could not  get videocassettes from Rhino or the scifi.com web store. (Bast...)  Fortunately for all of us Amazon.com is getting them and making them  available. I've been spreading the word. (No, I don't work for them.)...  (Could I?)... Anyway, This whole series preceded the movie ""The Net"" which  had almost plagiaristic similarities. Since then several television series  have come and quickly gone trying to capture the magic woven by the shows  writers and producers. Obviously the on screen talent is exceptional, but I  think they get enough press on their own. (This is starting to sound like a  plug.) I highly recommend each and every episode, including this one, in  the series. It does what few producers are willing to do: Go off on a high  note. Leave us wanting more, rather than flashback and dream sequence  episodes when the idea well is running dry. Then our last memories of our  favorite shows become tainted and we long for the early season's re-runs.  But enough about ""The X-Files"", find the soundtrack wherever you can (maybe  Amazon.com will even find it for you (hint to web survey editor) and  immerse yourself in cyberpunk.",956188800,2,1441,4.737903225806452
