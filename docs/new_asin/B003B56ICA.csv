8393493,5,B003B56ICA,"This is a powerful documentary telling the story of some truly amazing vintage aircraft and the people who restore and fly these machines. It tells the tale of ""beating swords into plowshares,"" bringing a unique level of emotion and an impressive feeling of honorable history to bear. This program originally aired on PBS, and it was a pledge favorite for the network for years after. Since then it has been that sort of hand-to-hand treasure that history buffs love to pass around.

If you are among those history buffs, or if you simply want to share the emotion and majesty that can be inspired by tales of human ingenuity and undaunted patriotism, I'd go beyond highly recommending this video. I would insist that you add it to your collection now, and share it with as many people as you can! It is the perfect primer for teaching children about the roots of aviation technology as much as about the challenges, the tragedies, and the triumphs of our veterans. An A+, and worth every penny.",1330387200,,995,4.718390804597701
