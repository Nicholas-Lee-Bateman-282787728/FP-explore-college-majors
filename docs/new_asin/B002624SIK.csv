3850706,5,B002624SIK,"Since the advent of Showtime's Borgia series, no film or documentary at all pertaining to the Borgias cannot pass without some comparison to the Showtime offering.  In many respects I found this film superior.

The success of a film is dependent upon a multiplicity of factors.  Some of those are intangibles.  Why we like one performer's work and not another's.  Such an intangible struck me at the very onset of the film.  The actors from the start of the film were 'darker' and more 'angular'.  Certainly in keeping with my own preconceptions of a proper 'Borgia-esc' look.

Much of the film was exceptionally well done.  However, some literary license was taken with historical fact.  While it makes for a better telling story, purists may bristle.  There is also some violence and nudity which some might be troubled with.  This IS a foreign language film (Spanish) and for those like me the subtitles are essential.  This film flashes those subtitles perhaps more quickly than any other film I have encountered recently.  While they are by no means beyond comprehension, they do require a bit of effort to keep up with and can deter somewhat from one's appreciation of the action on the screen.

It is said that Mario Puzo drew upon the Borgias as inspiration for the Godfather.  'Los Borgias' is certainly an excellent 'Godfather' where Sonny lived and there was no Michael to assume his father's mantle.",1318636800,6,1411,4.890295358649789
3850707,3,B002624SIK,"I don't remember why I got this movie.  It is really an almost.  I think I had the impression that the actors were very good, but the script and the unity of the story was just not the cream of the crop.  However (not being an expert on these things) the costumes and sets were fabulous, really well done.  For me I live somewhere where there are no spanish speakers, or media, and so it was nice to hear the Spanish language spoken and tell myself I'm not losing it.  I imagine that is not a great concern for most perusers, tho.  This might be only a 2 star.",1314489600,4,560,4.091743119266055
3850708,5,B002624SIK,This is a great primer for the new SHOWTIME miniseries with Jeremy Irons. The action scenes are fun. My only complaint would be how fast the subtitles seem to fly by.,1304553600,4,166,4.387096774193548
3850709,5,B002624SIK,"The casting, acting, direction and writing are all excellent. Los Borgias is a sympathetic interpretation; the darker rumours are portrayed as just that but left ambiguous enough that they could have some truth to them. The movie makes what on paper sounds stranger than fiction comprehensible. For example, when you read that Cesare threw a dinner party with 50 prostitutes for his father (the pope), sister and their friends it seems unimaginable, but the way it is portrayed in the movie makes it somehow less scandalous and more comprehensible (Rafael Sabatini questions this episode altogether, though his arguments are rather weak, especially in light of his interesting comment that our modern concept of modesty was not yet invented). The movie achieves that with all of the scandalous things--it humanizes them. Nonetheless, it still leaves you feeling abhorrence for Cesare and some for Alexander too. Lucrezia, on the other hand, is portrayed as an innocent victim of her family's ambition.

The movie manages to cover all the most important events without feeling rushed. And while it does condense things, it does so while staying as true to the history as possible.",1303257600,6,1179,5.205263157894737
3850710,5,B002624SIK,"English subtitles, but a good view of the time of the Borgias.  Women were just pawns, no matter how much their families loved them.  The families used the young women to make alliances and seal pacts.  Lush photography.",1295049600,3,220,4.7368421052631575
3850711,4,B002624SIK,"My only major complaint is that the closing credits are in such small print that they are indecipherable, even on a large HDTV screen.

My best friend's major complaint is that everyone shown in the film was too clean, as if they all bathed every hour.

I don't know much about Italian history of the era of the Borgias, but the film appears to try to give an accurate and reasonably unbiased summary of known facts about the Borgias and their times.  The cinematography is excellent, the music enhances the emotions without being overly dramatic, and the costumes and architecture aappear to be accurate.  The acting is superb and convincing.  Paz Vega is outstanding in a very small part.

The events are depicted realistically, with more violence than many would care for; this film is not for the squeamish nor is it appropriate for children.

I liked this film immensely, but I cannot place it on my list of 100 greatest films I've even seen.  But I would regret having missed it.  Note that it is presented entirely in Spanish, with English subtitles available.",1278460800,31,1067,4.755434782608695
3850712,4,B002624SIK,"If you love history, as I do, you should not miss this movie.  Pity it wasn't longer.  Details are amazing.  The resemblance - based, of course, on existing paintings - of the actors to the actual characters they were playing was just incredible.

Lucrezia Borgia, I was glad to see, was depicted not as the wicked woman we all remember but as a dutiful daughter, used by her unscrupulous father again and again as a pawn for the benefit of the family name.

This is an outstanding period piece.  Thumbs up from me!",1275696000,27,515,4.483870967741935
3850713,4,B002624SIK,"First, a few clarifications. Although the ""Product Details"" section says the film is 120 minutes in length and is presented in a ""full screen"" version, it actually runs over two hours and twenty minutes and is in a wide-screen format(it looks to be about 2.35:1 to me). Yellow, English subtitles are also available.

Now for the movie itself. I'm not an expert, but the film seems to be fairly accurate historically, especially for ""movie history"". This is most apparent in the depiction of Lucretia Borgia, played by Maria Valverde. She is not the murderous poisoner of legend, but a pawn of her father and brothers who is married off so the Borgias can create political alliances with other powerful families. There are some liberties taken with historical facts in order to tighten the narrative and make events less confusing. For example, in reality, Lucretia was only thirteen years old at the time of her first marriage. However, there's plenty of corruption, intrigue and assassination to keep the film interesting. Late in the film, when it looks like it might be slowing down a bit, Paz Vega shows up as sword-wielding Borgia opponent Caterina Sforza and gives the film a shot of adrenalin.

The movie is beautiful looking with lucious sets, costumes, and photography. It's fortunate that the film is presented in widescreen so this can be fully appreciated. The acting is also fine. The film has many virtues, but for me, comes up just short of those other Renaissance films QUEEN MARGOT and the first ELIZABETH with Cate Blanchett. That said, it's still a fine, entertaining film and well worth watching.",1260230400,100,1616,4.959409594095941
3850714,5,B002624SIK,Scandalous. A must see for the lover of intrigue and decadent church practices. Well crafted and acted.,1245888000,21,103,5.117647058823529

8351760,2,B002624SIK,"As with most versions of the Borigas, the filmmakers cherry picked from history to tell a story that only occasionally resembles the truth. If you're a fan of the history it can be infuriating to watch. Some moments are handled with reverence, while others are entirely fictitious: a little research will tell you which are which. The portrayal of Lucretia Borgia on film is almost always a bust. Los Borgia, at least, doesn't show her as the devil she's been portrayed as in the past but neither does it show her constantly making the most of her position and governing several cities, even, in her father's absence, the Vatican. Here she's a simple family pawn in search of love, playing second fiddle to the men. At least they left out incest. Then the film handles Juan's death with care but passes over Charles VIII's invasion of Italy entirely. And the early montage depicting the Borgia's reign of terror was ridiculous, it felt as if it were lifted from the Assassin's Creed history book.

If accuracy isn't your concern, the film comes up even shorter. Beautiful scenic cinematography can't save it from poor pacing. It feels like a miniseries chopped down and crammed into two and a half hours. Even Paz Vega fails to add any energy. She only briefly appears as a very simplified version of Caterina Sforza. DVD quality is good. No special features.

If you want entertainment, there are better films. If you want history, you're better off getting a book.",1486598400,,1466,4.790513833992095

8351763,5,B002624SIK,"Many legends surround this family from Aragon, Spain who raised to the pinnacle of power in the XV century Europe: the Roman Catholic Papacy.  When taken out of context, the cunning of this family is judged by XXI century standards and it is shocking.  This movie shows the raise of a family in an antagonistic environment where a few families had the civil and religious power under control and this Spanish Pope was not part of their plans. Rodrigo Borja is a smart, resourceful and highly intelligent man who aspires to the higher power amidst a milieu of violence, treason and murder, supported by his family: he had grown up children from his wife (it was not unusual for a couple to live together without a marriage ceremony: Galileo is another example about 100 years posterior to Borja).  Popes, and clergymen had mistresses and children, they fought in wars and were expected to behave as other heads of state (kings, emperors, chieftains).
Under the name of Alexander VI, Borja deals with changing times in Europe: the discovery of America, the power struggles between England (the War of the Roses and raise of the Tudors), France (with the Valois cousins, eventually with ""the most Christian King"" in Francois I), and Spain with the Catholic Queen and King (also king of Aragon); and of course the threat of the Ottoman Empire invading Europe.
The Borgias lived during what has been called the bloodiest century in Europe and supported the progress of Europe into the Renaissance.",1420070400,,1492,4.8893280632411065
8351764,1,B002624SIK,"You really would expect that the country that, you know, gave us the Borgias could do a better job of telling their story, but even a first-rate cast of actors couldn't save this stinker.  In fact, this movie is so bad it almost seems like a parody, but no.  It doesn't quite cross the ""so bad it's funny"" line and just stays in the ""really, really bad"" category.  Awful direction, terrible writing and even worse editing.  I really wish this had been available as a rentable video because then I wouldn't have it taking up space on my bookshelf.",1396310400,,546,4.484848484848484
