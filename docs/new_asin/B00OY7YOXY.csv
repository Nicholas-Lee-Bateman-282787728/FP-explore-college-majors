6775806,5,B00OY7YOXY,"Although I haven't worked my way through all the volumes, I loved this show when it was on television and was not happy when they stopped making it or showing it on television.  Although I recognize many of the stories from the original show, it's still good to hear about other people's faith and the ""miracles"" in their life.  It gives you hope for your own life and can boost your own faith.",1440374400,5,394,4.383561643835616

8685284,5,B00OY7YOXY,"I've seen several series featuring ""Miracles""- this is the best I've seen (I've watched the entire series).  Not only are the segments well-acted, but the miracles are amazing, often mind-boggling (and verified from multiple unimpeachable sources).  Another aspect is Richard Thomas' demeanor- he couldn't be better- engaging, authoritative, authentic, compassionate, affecting, dignified. No hyperbole here, just facts most profound, unassailable. Extremely well-written. Another bonus is that recreations with actors are juxtaposed with the real people's accounts, and often Thomas follows up with them live to see how they fared later. Very, very inspiring. This will restore your faith in humanity and life's infinite possibilities.  I've watched this through twice now, find it inspires me and raises me up when I'm mired in petty concerns or life's travails.  HIGHEST recommendation.",1522627200,,889,5.868217054263566
