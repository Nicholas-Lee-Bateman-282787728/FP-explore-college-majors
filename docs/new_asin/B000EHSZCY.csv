2520909,5,B000EHSZCY,"We have nearly every children's educational video ever made, including the entire Baby Einstein series, and Holy Baby! 2 is far and away the most entertaining, fun, creative and educational program ever made. Our yougest three children -- ages 8 months, three years and five years -- absolutely love it. They demand to see it over and over again. Best of all, Holy Baby! and Holy Baby! 2 have taught them how to pray. Our older children, who didn't have the benefit of these shows, always equated prayer and religion with boredom. The Holy Baby! series has managed to present faith and prayer as something joyful, and it has done so with reverence and respect for tradition. I truly believe that Holy Baby! DVDs have put prayer in the hearts and minds of our children for life. -- Mary Angelo, Wisconsin",1139875200,6,803,4.702127659574468

Dear Holy Baby Producers,

It has come to our attention that your Holy Baby video part II has a significantly disturbing Freemasonic image in one of Holy Baby IIs scenes.

As you may or may not know, Freemasonry has been condemned by the Church many times. As we understand the inclusion of such an image may have been done out of ignorance or oversight, we wish you become edified with the aforementioned fact and be very careful about the content you choose to include in your Christian videos in the future.

Sincerely and without malice,

Baby Priest totally weirds me out, but our toddler seems to enjoy the video, and that's what's important. Imagery of other little ones coupled with Catholic imagery keeps her attention.",1398038400,,262,5.116279069767442
8110253,5,B000EHSZCY,"My mom purchased the first Holy Baby for my son's baptism almost 6 years ago. When my daughter was born, this edition was purchased for her. Now my almost 6 year old son and his 4 year old sister STILL love these movies. I must say this one is my favorite too with Baby Bosco and his dog. My children even have the dolls and ball to play with while they watch. It's amazing to hear them singing the songs and reflecting on Jesus in the Mass as tiny tots. It's also making their religious education an organic learning instead of a forced endeavor.",1388707200,,547,4.269230769230769
8110254,5,B000EHSZCY,"Love this vol. 2! It is more unique than the 'Catholic baby Einstein' than vol 1 is. The music, prayers, pictures, reverent children are so sweet and innocent. The images, words and songs have captured my 2yr olds Interest. She daily asks to watch Holy Baby, sings alleluia, makes the sign of the cross and mimics the various reverent gestures and postures of the kids in the video. Best baby video! I have two older children who watched the wiggles and teletubbies, that was cute but Holy Baby is meaningful, eternal and beautiful. My older kids like Holy Baby too and enjoy teaching their little sister the songs and prayers. The video has even helped my left handed, embarassed to make a mistake, 7 yr old how to properly make the sign of the cross with his right hand. We greatly prefer vol 2 to vol 1.",1372809600,,806,4.489795918367347
8110255,4,B000EHSZCY,"Real world objects, classic music, children and babies to look at? Any baby would love this. When I first bought Baby Einstein movies, I was turned off by the videos that repeated nursery rhymes and songs. What is my baby really learning? If you're going to show them something, let it MEAN SOMETHING. My daughter now prefers Holy Baby to Baby Einstein, and obviously, I do too. Very quality, cool animation, and all the songs are well done (with the exception of the ever-annoying ""This Little Light of Mine"").",1275264000,,511,4.752808988764045

8110257,5,B000EHSZCY,"After several years of enjoying our original ""Holy Baby"" DVD, we were thrilled to get this next one in the series.

This one features ""Baby Bosco"" inspired by St. John Bosco and it is lively and entertaining just like the first Holy Baby DVD.  All four of my young children enjoyed it.

This one is about Jesus and the Eucharist - it includes many of the prayers and scriptures of the Mass and features various images of the precious Body and Blood, a monstrance containing the precious Body, and images of two very kind and friendly Priests consecrating the bread and wine.  It also includes some children's songs [such as ""Rise and Shine"", ""Jesus Loves Me"", and ""This Little Light of Mine""].

This DVD is extremely well done and I am pleased to have it in our home - both to reinforce the prayers and Bible verses my older children already know and to help my younger children to learn about their prayers, scripture, and the Sacred Mass.

We are very pleased with this DVD.  THANK YOU Rosary Project for giving us another excellent tool to help catechize our children at the earliest possible age!",1145145600,6,1100,4.61025641025641
