3411953,5,B0018738R6,"If you are into Lily Tomlin you will get a kick out of this one. It is short but Lily tells about her early days in Highland Park, Michigan. It has a warm ambiance and is rather humorous. Did you know that Lily Tomlin is Miss Frizzle on the Magic School Bus? She was also on Laugh In and various films such as ""The Incredible Shrinking Woman"" & ""Nine to Five"" This is an amazing woman who was a personal friend of my mom's when they were just school girls. I hope to meet her some day and get my mom and her together for lunch or coffee. Let me know if you see this review Ms. Tomlin. I really enjoyed this biographical video.",1235779200,4,626,4.056451612903226
3411954,5,B0018738R6,Great interview with Lily Tomlin and so heartwarming (as well as heart wrenching) to hear her talk about Detroit. Those of us who once lived there will understand....,1399593600,,166,4.964285714285714
3411955,4,B0018738R6,I enjoyed this video.  It kind of left me hanging as it seemed too short.  At this length a series of artists interviewed in a similar manner would be very interesting.,1398643200,2,168,4.387096774193548
3411956,4,B0018738R6,"I was not aware that this very engaging documentary had been made.  It is a part of a documentary about Detroit that included Ms. Tomlin's comments about her former home, Detroit.  It was nice to watch.",1396224000,,202,4.583333333333333
3411957,1,B0018738R6,I did not like it because of all the other garbage recommendations it brought up making it a very bad choice.,1371945600,,109,4.238095238095238
3411958,4,B0018738R6,"Having grown up in Flint, I have some of the same memories that Lily does, I'm sure. The sad look on her face when they spotted her old house and it was very neglected kind of brought the whole story home.  Detroit just is not what it used to be. Still, the video did have some insightful and happier moments. I will give it a B+",1348272000,,329,3.984848484848485
3411959,5,B0018738R6,I love Lily Tomlin.  She is great.  This movie is great.  Footage you will mostly likely not find anywhere else in the world.  It is very insightful and thought provoking.  Glad I own it.,1312070400,2,187,4.382352941176471
3411960,2,B0018738R6,"Whether Lily was reticent to bad-mouth her childhood digs or the author and editor left her pithier comments out of the final edit, this commentary has virtually no values attached to it. I'm sure Ms. Tomlin has a lot to say about Detroit, the government's abandonment of cities, her mixed feelings about revisiting her old neighborhood.  Sadly, none of that is here.",1258848000,3,367,4.919354838709677
3411961,5,B0018738R6,"Lily Tomlin has told stories for much of her career. Here she is, doing what she does best. Love it!",1254873600,,100,4.05
3411962,5,B0018738R6,What else can you say?  It's Lily Tomlin!!  She's a great storyteller... and this is well worth watching.,1253491200,,105,4.777777777777778
3411963,5,B0018738R6,"This film is a wonderful look at not only Lily Tomlin but most especially at the city of Detroit.  Lily's emotional connection to her hometown is very evident as she both laughs about great memories and suffers over what's happened to her neighbordhood.  Great work by the filmmaker, and a true treasure.",1252713600,3,304,4.826923076923077
8268600,4,B0018738R6,Very nice like most I wish the documentary was longer I hope to see what she has coming up soon but it was nice to see where she grew up,1498348800,,136,3.566666666666667
8268601,2,B0018738R6,not what i was expecting. not funny.,1466294400,,36,4.285714285714286
8268602,5,B0018738R6,"I just adore Lily Tomlin and always have.  I reside in LA and saw her live at the Wiltern  Theatre many years ago and she was beyond fabulously hysterical and brilliant.  This very short  documentary is well done.  She basically does a brief life review of her childhood, her experiences, and the people she encountered and the impact it all had on her life.  She seems saddened to see what has happened to her former neighborhood in Detroit and very sad when she mentions that her mother passed away.  You can see the sadness in her eyes and hear it in her tone.  But, for any of you who want to learn more about this fabulous actor, I encourage you to watch this.  You won't be disappointed.  She has  a way of really capturing her audience.  With that said, I wish the documentary was longer.",1465257600,,795,4.406896551724138

I thought what was in the doc was great and i love lily tomlin just thought it would've gotten a little deeper.",1458000000,,276,4.431372549019608
