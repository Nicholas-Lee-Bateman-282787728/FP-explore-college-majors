1722811,4,B0000687FM,"This is considered a TV show turned movie. It's very well made, with great fight choreography (By Donnie Yen), casting, directing, and camera work. Some things to consider: I was confused about a line in the back of the CD case which said that Donnie's character was to train in the Shaolin Temple. Shaolin was not in the movie. Also there are many missing scenes or unanswered questions. The reviewer before me stated that there might be a ""The Kung Fu Master 2"" in the making. I sure hope so as I'd very disappointed (as I think others would too), if those questions weren't answered. Fantastic movie....please show the rest.",1046217600,3,627,4.709090909090909

7963865,5,B0000687FM,"I was hesitant to get this dvd due to some negative reviews, but being Donnie Yen fan I took the risk and boy was I glad I did. Knowing how old kung fu tv shows are like I was prepared for the worst, but I was very pleasantly surprised on how the plot remained strong throughout the show, how the characters portrayed their circumstances and the action scenes were fluid and very enjoyable. This show has some heavy duty philosophy and portrayal of human struggle trying maintain dignity in the face of cruel oppression. Not only was I entertained by the fight scenes but the relationship between father and son as well as the relationships they have with other characters are very moving. Dare I say it...it actually brought tears to my eyes. One of the best features I like about the dvd is the commentaries and I can't seem to stop watching is over and over again. If you're into classic Kung Fu TV shows, I'd say this one is it. Enjoy!",1316390400,,939,4.433526011560693
7963866,2,B0000687FM,"The costumes and settings reveal this movie's shoestring budget. The fighing scenes are below par compared with other good films starring Donnie. The acting and the plot are not intersting either. This is more like a bad TV show than a movie. Donnie's famous for his kung fu skills. You should see Iron Monkey, Hero, Butterfly sword, Once upon a time in China 2 and Blade 2 to appreciate how good he is.

It's still worth renting to satisfy your curiosity.",1197158400,,456,4.62962962962963
7963867,2,B0000687FM,"i love donnie yen on iron monkey and once upon a time in china 2, so i decided to buy this movie expecting a raw good kung fu action.  However, I ended having a a huge dissapointment on the film because the action are being fast forward in purpose so that it will look like they are fighting rapidly.  I would have continue watching the film if the director would just left the action scene the way it was without fast forwarding it.  The action lost its rawness; therefore, about 20 minutes later of the film i stop watching it.  This film is about the fourth time in a row that I wasted my money with kung fu movies such as the last duel, deadful melody and the leg fighters.  I need to be more cautios next time =(",1168992000,2,717,4.129496402877698
7963868,4,B0000687FM,"While this film is definitley a must for all Kung Fu Junkies out there, it may be a little hard to swallow for the average person. Donnie Yen Is Incredible, and this movie does produce some great fight scenes, However, the Production, direction, and several other aspects leave so much to be desired that its actually distracting from the movie.

Much Love though to Donnie Yen and all the other great Martial Artists who contributed.",1154131200,2,434,4.786666666666667
7963869,5,B0000687FM,"The last reviewer mentioned that the flick bombed because of the quality and all that. I would just like to bring to his attention that this is not a film, it is a TV action series which obviously doesn't have the financial backing a regular movie has. Considering the before mentioned explanation, it is my opinion that this is great entertainment. I cant't wait for Revenge of The Kung Fu MAster to arrive by mail.",1105747200,,416,4.56
7963870,4,B0000687FM,"Kung Fu Master is part one, The Revenge Of the Kung Fu Master is part two of this series. The kung fu action/story is great, and you have choice of watching dubbed or subtitled. DVD also has extras with interviews with the director etc. The Revenge of The Kung Fu master is more entertaining, however lacks the dubbed version and does not include mandarin as an option. Part one is the tale of an underground resistance lead by the red dragon against a government that is absurdly evil. Fight scenes are not bad (a little sped up in some scenes and lots of wires), though not as good as the New Legend of Shaolin (same characters in jet li movie), however I have a preference to Jet Li's style to Donnie Yen.  Although it's a matter of taste because they are both awesome.",1103328000,2,772,4.398601398601398
7963871,1,B0000687FM,"This movie was seriously the worst movie i have ever seen.  Well not exactly i didn't see all of it because it was too lame so i turned it off.  I love kung fu movie too so thats not the reason i have a collection of a bunch of new and old kung fu movies.  And i like donnie Yen in Hero (jet li) and iron monkey, but in this movie he was unlikeable.  The main thing that made this movie bad was the fighting it was bad it was chopy and way too excelerated.  It was nothing like Once Upon a time in China, or Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Hero. It wasn't like Jackie chan style or Like Fists of legend it was just bad.

If you liked any of the other movie i named you won't like this one.",1092960000,,741,3.979591836734694
7963872,3,B0000687FM,"Donnie Yen fan here.  Love him.  Think he's the best.  I'm talking about the video version here, not the DVD.  Classic storyline, but the movie goes on and on.  The fight scenese are pretty, but hard for me to follow, the action was sped up to the point of being too fast.  I wish that the HK audience would be less into that stuff, and more into what's really important-- good kung fu.  Good kung fu can be just as exhilarating at realistic speeds, and we could appreciate the skill of the principals better.  A little speed up I can take, this one seemed TOO FAST for me.
The story went on and on.  Yes, the characters evolved and struggled and grew.  But it was just Donnie's character going through one iteration after another of the same lesson-- I must learn to see more of the big picture, I must not let my rage take over my actions.  Still, as expected, his heart is in the right place, and that ultimately helps him to develop his kung fu to overcome all else.
Oh, I didn't mind necessarily.  Seeing Donnie Yen is what I get and watch these movies for.  The movies that burn me are the ones where you get cameras zooming in on Donnie's SHOULDER the entire fight scene.  What's the point of that?  This one at least provided some good scenes and good action, with good camerawork for much of it.
A lot of pole work in this movie.  It seems to be Donnie's favorite weapon throughout many movies-- pole or spear.  He's wonderful with it.  It's not really my expertise, but I know enough about it to appreciate the difficulty and his skill.  Still, I wish we could see more movies from him where it's more realistic speed, hand-to-hand, endless grunts and shouts, as they exchange blows and counterblows across rooms, up and down stairs, like in the old B-Hong Kong kung fu movies I watched at midnight on TV as a kid.
Still, I've seen worse from Donnie.  This was a solid film as far as HK kung fu movies go.  Legend of the Wolf, for example, where I got very acquainted with Donnie's left shoulder during fight scenes, and was left dumbfounded by the lack of even a simplistic plot.  But that's another review.",1079827200,,2118,4.390745501285347
