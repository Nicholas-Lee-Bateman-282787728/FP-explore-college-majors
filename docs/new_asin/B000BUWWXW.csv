8206530,5,B000BUWWXW,"EL BARBARO DEL RITMO offers an excellent show featuring the music of Beny More, Cuba's Frank Sinatra in the 1950's.  The DVD tracks feature a 21 piece latin orchestra with full brass and percussion ensemble that is a joy to listen to. As a bonus, the old cuban style 50's tropicana show also showcases scantily clad female salsa dancers. However, there's no doubt the star of the show is former Van Van vocalist/troubadour, Israel Kantor, who is perfect singing the music of Beny More.  Impeccable likeness of Beny. ""Bonito y Sabroso"" and ""Camarera"" are true gems. The DVD picture quality and sound are excellent.  Enjoy.  Highly recommended.",1161216000,,642,4.97196261682243
