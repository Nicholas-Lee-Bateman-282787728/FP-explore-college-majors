7616742,5,B01B1XA2KC,"This movie was so cute!  Two love stories woven together.  I enjoyed the search of the mystery love story just as much as the current one. I adored the character of Gabe!  If you're a regular Hallmark viewer, whether their regular channel and/or their movies and mysteries channel, I bet you'll enjoy this one!",1468540800,9,310,4.703703703703703
7616743,5,B01B1XA2KC,"This movie is a gem and is something a Hallmark movie advocate would enjoy. This movie is about a photographer, Chloe Davenport, who finds a memory book featuring a ""young and in love"" couple decades ago and she sets out to find them and see that true love really exists. Throughout the movie, Chloe and the male counterpart, Gabe, search for clues in hopes to locate them and it takes them on a cute adventure. I love this movie! It's romantic, sweet, has cute flirty banter and heart. I look forward to this when it comes on TV but now I can buy the DVD. I recommend this movie for any romantic.",1468454400,,597,4.339285714285714
7616744,5,B01B1XA2KC,I have never been much of a fan of Hallmark/Lifetime movies but this one sticks with you. The plot line is very real and actually believable..Luke Macfarlane is excellent! It even got a skeptic to believe that true love is really out there. Highly recommend!,1467763200,,258,4.7555555555555555
7616745,4,B01B1XA2KC,"The Memory Book is about a photographer who stumbles upon a photo book of a young couple from the early 1970s.  She has a hard time believing true love really exists and sets out to find the couple in the photo book.  She also sets out on a journey to find true love herself.

I thought the movie was entertaining and made for a good chick flick.  It is a pretty predictable love story, but I did like the fact that she set out to find out who the photo book belonged to and what happened to the people over the years.

I received this movie free from Fishflix in exchange for my honest review and opinion.",1466553600,5,606,4.145299145299146

7616781,5,B01B1XA2KC,"My family and I really enjoyed this movie! I initially watched it on Hallmark and of course fell in love with it, so we purchased the dvd right away. Great, touching storyline about a young girl who finds an old ""memory book"" at a flea market with tons of pictures in it of this couple. She becomes infatuated with finding out their story and ends up sharing this adventure with a very charming man she meets along the way. It's very clean and family friendly as well! We laughed, we cried, and we fell in love with this story and the characters. Highly recommend for all ages.",1476662400,6,577,4.401869158878505

If you like a relationship that develops realistically within the scope of 90 minutes, ditto.

7616796,5,B01B1XA2KC,"This is not a detailed film review. We have wonderful reviewers here on Amazon, of which I am not one. This is just a message about what this film is, for anyone who has read the basic plot and remains undecided. This, as you may have noticed, is one of the Hallmark Channel made for television romances we have all seed popping up many times every year on that channel, particularly at Valentine's Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas. This particular film aims, very specifically, to tell a story about a woman who fears failure in relationships and who genuinely believes that all relationships are destined to failure. It is about the journey she takes, with a lovely and kind gentleman, to discover, through meeting new people, what her life will be if she doesn't let go of her fear and stop pushing people away. It is a wonderful film to watch with a socially phobic person. I watched this and then passed in on to a male friend who fears commitment, not to say that he should settle down but to say that he should open up to people if he wants a life filled with love. I actually had the opposite reaction to this film, specifically, feeling that I have enough love and should work more, watching this young woman work so hard in her actual job while taking a journey of self discovery. Whatever your response, this is appropriate for all ages, has no objectionable content and contains a heartwarming message about love and family and the many roads we take to find meaning and connection in our lives. It is not a sexy story, it is not violent, it is not action packed. It is quiet, romantic, simple and sweet. I hope this helps you to make your choice. Good luck.",1470614400,26,1669,4.511551155115511
8749051,5,B01B1XA2KC,"I first caught this movie on the Diva channel here in Singapore several years ago and loved it! Decided to later purchase the DVD. Both Meghan Ory and Luke Macfarlane had on-screen chemistry, with a great supporting cast (particularly, Art Hindle and Adrienne Barbeau, and John Cassini).

8749060,4,B01B1XA2KC,"Love story mystery unfolds as a nice movie. Low key and mellow, artistic, beautiful San Francisco and a bit of nature scenes of Yosemite. Actually, what I will most remember about this is the incredible clothes she was wearing, especially toward the end, these blouses that left me wondering 'where did they get those masterpieces' (my taste anyway) and how lovely they were against her beautiful skin/face. Glowingly beautiful woman. In the beginning, she was in black with red lipstick; little did we know how feminine and natural and stylish she would be shortly thereafter. The leading man was also good. You could feel their chemistry. Quite a romantic movie in it's on indirect way. Recommended for romantics.",1512345600,,715,5.067796610169491
