8228014,3,B000XCZF00,This DVD is cheap because the quality is bad. There are other versions of this same show available that cost a little more - but the quality is ten times better than this DVD.,1356480000,,175,4.176470588235294
8228015,4,B000XCZF00,"I watch this Christmas show every year and it always produces the same reactions in me.....Garland looks lovely in this episode of her short-lived series....beautifully quaffed & wearing a very flattering hostess gown, she's in very good voice..... exquisite when singing Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, Little Drops of Rain, and an incredibly moving Over the Rainbow....and to hear her beautiful voice wrapping about The Christmas Song (in spite of whatever her and ""Torment"" were going through) is a very special moment. As for the other elements of the show, for me it's mostly a mediocre affair. Jones is boring, I'm not fond of Mel (Mort!), and cannot stand the way he ""conducts"" that phony, plastic-sounding chorus.  Lorna and Joey should have spent the night with Joan Crawford and her kids (they cannot even remember the words to Silent Night heaven help them!), and Liza is, as another reviewer so aptly put, definitely not ready for prime-time, extremely embarrassing to watch her romping about with her ""beau"" Tracy, and her rendition of Alice Blue Gown is suitable for today's wretched ""American Idol"" standards.
Why oh why couldn't the forces at hand just given us more Garland without all the tacky christmas kitsch going on about her?
Again, Garland's artistry is magical to behold as usual, and is the only reason to view this Christmas concoction.

There is another for sale with Judy in a red dress that I own as well - very different quality.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Judy-Garland-Show-Vol-03-The-Christmas-Show-Show-15/dp/B00002IIYL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Judy Garland Show, Vol 03 - The Christmas Show (Show 15)</a>",1290556800,3,453,6.9298245614035086
8228017,5,B000XCZF00,This brought back some old memories.  Very fun step back into the past!  Arrived in good time and great shape.  It was worth the buy for me to reminisce!,1269216000,,153,4.206896551724138
8228018,4,B000XCZF00,"4 generations watched this together and we all enjoyed it.  I especially liked seeing the old commercials from that time.  I really miss variety shows.  I wish they would rerun all the classic specials like this, Andy Williams, Osmonds etc.",1251676800,,240,4.95
8228019,5,B000XCZF00,"I love the music in this show!  There are so many classic songs as well as one's I have never heard before, but are now some of my favorites. Very fun film to watch and/or listen to while putting up the tree or wrapping some gifts!  Very fun show!",1227139200,2,247,4.020408163265306
