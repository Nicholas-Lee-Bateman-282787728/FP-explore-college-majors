Who then follow thru to the logical conclusion and become American Citizens. I found it both Extremely moving and touching in a huge way.

I also feel that these folks are the major reason. On why we as America are the last and best hope for the World. Because they could of gone anywhere in the world . But they choose us. Which in my humble opinion says a lot about us and them.

Also these folks bring so much hope, faith and drive to these shores. That and they have jumped thru all the hoops and done it the hard, right and honorable way. I admire them so much and they make me so proud to be associated with them!",1496016000,,794,4.083333333333333

More than anything this shows that people becoming U.S. citizens appreciate this country so much especially compared to where they came from.
