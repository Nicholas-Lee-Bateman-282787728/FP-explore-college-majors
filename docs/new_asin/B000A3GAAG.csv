The movie is something along the lines of Jim Henson's darker creations like Labyrinth or Dark Crystal. Similar to these films, the characters in this film are played by real humans, but with puppet heads and body parts. The characters are animals, chickens, rats, pigs and dogs (as is the main character).

Now let's make a distinction between Marquis and Henson productions. This movie is NOT a family movie, nor could it ever be. It is also NOT a fantasy. It plays more like a drama, a mock drama at that. You can not help but laugh at the actions and facial expressions of the characters. And if you finally get past all the puppetry eye candy and listen to what is being said, you will quickly realize that the whole movie is a social commentary.

This is sure to be one of the most bizarre films you will ever see. The whole premise is broken up with conversations between this dog-man, mentioned above, and an unmentionable body part of his. Quite whacked. Quite Bizarre. Yet oddly watchable.",1206144000,,1181,4.530516431924883
