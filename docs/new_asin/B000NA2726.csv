8176012,5,B000NA2726,"Well I'm revisiting my childhood here but I thought this particular dvd was a fun purchase and well worth it!
 I only wish it was an hour longer! There is some bonus material that makes up for it a bit.
The Heavy Metal Sisters were/are my favorite! Ninotchka ,  Palestina and And Tina Ferrari have some great match ups as well! I bought this and started collecting the rest .
It's so fun to go back to these matches and watch them as an adult, and for me this is way better than WWE right now!!!
Great skits and raps and so lighthearted without a care G.L.O.W. is legendary and I feel sorry for you if can't enjoy this!",1354665600,,619,4.19327731092437

8176015,4,B000NA2726,"I wish the complete full seasons were released rather than the Best of editions but this one is still worth checking out. The other reviewer pointed out the matches to you, but there are some extra features that you might enjoy like clips from the GLOW Games of Summer which was hosted by David McLane and Susie Spirit (sporting a cast after breaking her elbow...really wish they'd show us that match again!). If you recall thats when the first season gals competed against each other in the pizza eating contest, the escalator races, the tug of war, arm wrestling, etc... Another feature is the full length music video of the Bad Girls performing ""Nasty and Mean"". However, I was disappointed that they only showed a few seconds of the Good Girls music video ""Good Girls Don't"". What were the dvd producers thinking not including a full segment of the GLOW girls wearing bikinis at the Riviera Hotel poolside?!?! There is also a small compilation of Chainsaw and Spike's greatest moments in the wrestling ring. To the dvd producers, give us the complete full season box sets!",1179100800,10,1076,4.790322580645161
