211362,5,6300180247,"Ok, here it goes, i was around the house one sunday afternoon, when i turned on the sci-fi channel, becausei know that around sunday, they have some awesome low budget movies, i love those!!!(most of them anyway) I had only missed the beginning by around 10 minutes, so i didn't miss a whole lot. But what i did see astounded me. the frst thing i saw was a low budget, so i was intrigued, and i'll aggree with phantosmos that the acting was a little on the bad side, but what hit me hardest was that the makers of this fine piece of film had a very low budget, but they used every bit of that budget to the very maximum. i thought that the individual motifs for the monster guys was pretty cool.",1032480000,4,695,4.1940298507462686
211363,1,6300180247,"If you ever happen to be viewing the Sci-Fi Channel at around 2 a.m. and begin to wonder what the perpetual image of dung with monsters floating around in it is, then you may be watching NEON MANIACS. This little piece of bad 1980's shock-and-scare tactics should be ranked amongst the worst films ever mentally conceived, let alone actually produced. But hey, do not simply take my word for it. Listen to the brilliant storyline. Basically, it all starts with a crusty old fisherman in San Fran who discovers a pile of trading/tarot cards depicting various monstrous creatures in stylish poses. Old salt is subsequently killed by the REAL heathens, and he isn't the only one! The Halloween rejects then commence with their trek to the inner city to prey upon unsuspecting teens, thus finding a tasty group and slaughtering all involved sans the beautiful blonde with no acting ability. For some reason, the goobers sweat a green goo, this being the only evidence true evidence in the murder case. Naturally, no one believes the impressionable young blonde was attacked by corporeal comic book monsters, and the only one who can bestow any form of comfort is the young Bobby Vinton wannabe who has a crush on her. The duo end up running afoul of the goobers some 20 times before staging the final battle at the school dance, a lengthy scene depicting everything from death by waterguns, mutant disco, and even a rotund character who falls victim to a goober dressed like a surgeon while watching T.V. in the bowels of the building. Sound cute? It certainly is not. The driving question of this film can oddly be summed up in word: Why? Why do the goobers emit green goo? Why can they only be destroyed with water? Why is the acting so bad? Why is their a ridiculous attempt at a poetic monologue at the beginning of the film? Why are the goobers referred to as the 'Neon Maniacs'? Is it because they only attack at night, i.e. like neon signs, implying that they work best at night? Why do the goobers live under the Golden Gate Bridge? Why does San Fran have Subway systems? Why are the goobers all humanoid except for the diminutive cyclopian reptile? Is he their leader or a bad plot device? Why doesn't the 80's metal band Judas Priest come to the school dance to show the goobers what a real rock group looks like? If this were so, would it make the film any less incomprehensible? Would it actually make it more difficult? Where did the trading/tarot cards come from? Do the goobers have their own printing company? Why do they decide to kill instead of bring peace? Why do they exist AT ALL? What exactly is their mission? What ARE THEY ANYWAY? Where in the name of the vortex did these things come from? Why won't they JUST GO HOME!? Why didn't I TURN THE CHANNEL!? The best answer is that their is no answer. If David Lynch had wrote and directed this film, there may at least have been some fraction of artistic merit to it. Even Lynch ties his films together in some manner. THIS is just scattered nonsense. The make-up/prosthetic effects are anything but special, the soft music score is completely out of place, and the screenplay is so absurd that it was probably defecated rather than written. To be honest, I would not even give this excrement one star. This is easily one of the 10 worst films ever made, alongside such winners as ""Street Trash"", ""Space Mutiny"", and ""Freddy Got Fingered"". So, viewer beware, for the Neon Maniacs are out to get you and your aesthetic judgment. Be sure to pack plenty of waterguns and common sense, because they happen to be the only defensive weapons against this garbage. You have been warned.

211384,4,6300180247,"This is an absolutely 80s horror film & its obvious when you watch it. It is very enjoyable however. This was my first time watching it & I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Is the plot anything great? No but it was fun for what it is. The maniacs were also varied in both their looks & how they killed people. The story is a bit thin, they just show up at the beginning of the film, kill some teens in a park, 1 girl survives but no one though the movie believes her until a bit later. Its never really fully explained where they come from but a hint of sorts is seen at the end of the film. The effects were ok but I felt the make up was well done for its time. If you are looking for a fun 80s horror film that will hold your attention this is it, its also something a little different in that its not a typical slasher from that era. Worth checking out for sure. Not many extras on disc except an isolated music score, an interview & the original trailer but still worth the buy for me. For those that want this on Blu Ray its available on the Screen Archives web site from Code Red, that's the version I own & have seen.",1443830400,,1142,3.9912663755458517
211385,3,6300180247,"It's total 80's horror b-movie monster cheese! which is excellent if that's your standard for movies. It does have very little explanation that takes away from some of it's charm. That being said, the cast is pretty great (once you get past the first ten minutes)  , they hold steady in a movie that could have easily been flushed had it not been for the banter, costumes, music and partial plot.
I couldn't honestly rate this above a 3 on a scale of the entire film, so i'll break it down a little bit.
- The plot was decent but lacked a solid ending, even for a ""horror"" movie open endings are fine, but this felt like someone pulled the brakes.
- Spending waaaay too much time on stupid things, like walking, i don't care, i know they got from point a, to point b, i don't need proof!
- The amazing make-up deserves 5+ stars, it's beautiful cheesy and still a bit gross. Perfection.
- The Band scene, i actually enjoyed the song, the second band not so much  (i get that that was the point, but it dragged)
- Paula is pretty awesome, and i think a lot of us early horror fans can relate to her, i just wish they delved into her character more.
It's totally worth a shot if you are a fan of 80's cheese (sorry to keep using that term, but it is! it's nacho cheesy goodness ) . If you aren't, then you will more than likely hate this.",1437177600,2,1335,4.190661478599222

211421,4,6300180247,"As bad films go, this one's pretty enjoyable.

Anchor Bay, not long ago, released a wonderful widescreen DVD of NEON MANIACS. But you can also enjoy this on tape, because VHS copies are still floating around at used video stores. And perhaps an old VHS tape might be better for generating that 80's feeling...

This is the infamous low-budget horror flick from 1985 that boasts a gaggle of weird, oozing monsters--each with a different look and method of killing--who come out at night, ready for action. The movie takes place in San Francisco--and the monsters actually make their home under the Golden Gate Bridge (!). Sure, why not? It could happen.

The title monsters are NEVER referred to as ""Neon Maniacs"" by any of the characters. A narrator has a brief speech early on in the film and says something like ""The children's path shall be darkened...by the SHADOWS of the...NEON MANIACS."" (Yeah. Whatever.) But that's the only time you hear the term, and as a justification for the title, it's flimsy at best. AND, as noted by many, the monsters are NEVER explained in any way. At all!

Near the end of the film there is a climactic scene at a high school costume dance featuring an astounding ""Battle of the 80's Bands"" (one a Rick Springfield knockoff, the other a lame heavy metal group) that will have you squirming and your face contorting into various peculiar grimaces and scowls. Yow!

This is a time capsule film. You watch it to see what things looked like, what was going on twenty-odd (very odd) years ago. But please take care: What you see, you may find upsetting.

80's horror had its own very unique and pointless stamp, and this is one of the best examples of an endearingly BAD 80's horror film--just as THE BREAKFAST CLUB is one of the best examples of an endearingly good 80's teen film. That is to say, NEON MANIACS, despite how awful it is, is memorable. It gives you a strange warm happy feeling inside when you watch it. And when it's over, you think about it--chortle to yourself over it. You might even recommend it to your friends. And you know perfectly well that it's not a good movie at all! That it's one of the worst movies you've ever seen!! See it tonight! Yes, it's crap. Yes, it's fun.",1335830400,4,2226,4.594458438287154

211454,1,6300180247,"This is without a doubt one of the worst films i've ever witnessed in my life. It starts out explaining how the maniacs got there but I couldn't hear it. A man sees tarot cards of the monsters and is killed. Then a bunch of teens are partying and get slaughtered expect one. The monsters are pounding on the van and within seconds they are gone (along with all the dead bodies) as the cops show up. This was one of many unanswered questions in this awful mess. The acting was pretty bad as most of the lines have a delayed reaction like oh right, my line. Then we find out the maniacs are killed by water and they live under the Golden Gate Bridge. &*!#@ this film is beyond stupid. I wonder if M Night Shyamalan borrowed the idea of killing aliens with water from this movie. The these maniacs stalks the virgin but she hides and finds time to make out with her boyfriend. There is no sense of danger as the monsters barely do anything. A few scenes of gore but nothing to get excited over.

Overall, one of the worst executed films of all time. So many unanswered questions will leave you scracthing your head and reaching for the stop button. I've seen bad films but this diffently goes in my top ten or maybe even five. AVOID THIS MOVIE!",1279670400,,1241,4.303418803418803
211455,3,6300180247,"NEON MANIACS is a slice of B-Movie greatness that is overlooked far too often. It offers all of the 80s Horror cliches that many fans grew up loving in its corny teen characters, synthesized electric score, and abundant latex monster designs. A lone teen survives a brutal attack by a group of mutant freaks beneath the Golden Gate Bridge, and she must convince two unlikely friends to help protect her when the monsters return to finish the job! The film is clearly a fan-made fantasy Horror effort that was used as an excuse to showcase the creative make-up and gore FX. Unfortunately, the concept was just too large for the script or director to handle. There are constant struggles with pacing as the plot meanders between a teen drama and full-blooded monster flick. The actionless exposition serves as nothing more than filler between the killings, stifled by throwaway characters and empty dialog Once the creeps hit the scene, though, it is all mindless murder and gratuitous gore, but these bloody moments are few and far between. Though it is a small film, it is given a large feel as the mutants take to the streets and subway in pursuit of the teens. This creates the impression of a city overrun by monsters in just a few short scenes. The maniacs themselves show an array of unique and interesting designs, creating a group not unlike the inhabitants of Midian from Clive Barker's NIGHTBREED, though lacking the mythical qualities and lore inherent in Barker's conceptions. In the end, NEON MANIACS is a mixed bag. It is awesomely entertaining at times, while mercilessly boring at others, but even in its worst moments, it remains a nostalgic look back at the height of 80s cheese.

211456,4,6300180247,"The Neon Maniacs are a gang of mutant monsters that live inside the Golden Gate Bridge.  We never find out just who or what they are, but we do know that they come out at night to slaughter people, and that water kills them.  They use a variety of weapons including crossbows, swords, axes, guns and chains.  Each creature seems to have it's own theme.  There's a samurai, a doctor, a biker without a nose, an ape, a soldier, a Native American(he uses a tomahawk), a Toxic Avenger lookalike, a reptilian beast, an electricity shooting robotic type, and a few more.  They look sort of like a zombie/monster version of the Village people.  Natalie is the sole survivor of the opening Neon Maniac massacre(it's stated she's a virgin, so naturally that's how she must have survived), and soon becomes their new target.  Why?  How the hell do I know?  So Natalie teams up with new boyfriend, Stephen and a horror movie obsessed girl named Paula.  Naturally the police are useless, even when they become involved.  Natalie, Stephen and Paula have a few chases and escapes with the Neon maniacs, but it all comes to a head at the battle of the bands at the local high school where we get treated to the rocking sounds of Quiet Riot wannabees, Jaded.  We also get a few tunes from Stephen's fruity A-HA clone of a band.  Armed with squirt guns they go toe to toe with the Neon Maniacs.
Yup, this movie is about as dumb as it sounds, but that's what makes it a fun little B monster flick.  Stephen and Natalie break numerous horror movie safety rules, the cops are about as cliched as it gets, the music doesn't fit, and the monsters are silly(yet cool looking regardless), but these are all good things.  To me this film comes across as a kind of horror version of the Garbage Pail Kids movie.  Mindless monster fun.",1208563200,,1808,4.516923076923077

The film moves along quickly and by the end you know exactly the same amount about the maniacs as when it started... yep, they're ugly and mean(you do get to know how to defeat them) and kill, well; because they are the bad guys of course!  Don't ask so many questions already!  Just put your brain on cruise control and enjoy the show... oh, and be prepared to laugh and shake your head.

  It seems that these........ uh..... Well maniacs have always lived inside the Golden Gate bridge and for some reason decide that now is time to leave and slaughter most of the population of San Francisco. They , as one reviewer states, appear to be the Village People with more than the Y.M.C.A. on their mind. Their only weakness is strangely water, which must make living near the water very rough, and a few of the teens who manage to stay alive get ready to send these nasty suckers off to sing ""In the Navy"" with water guns, hoses, even beer cans.
  It sounds and is silly I know but it has the effect of watching a 3rd grade play unfold, Not very good but the kids sure try hard. The gore level is high so if you don't like that skip it, but if you just want to ""kill"" a little time this might be for you.",1187654400,2,996,4.066326530612245

211460,3,6300180247,"The introductory scene was an odd one to be sure; a fisherman on the Golden Gate Bridge heads home for the night. He passes a big metal door beneath the bridge and finds a bunch of Tarot-like cards in a bleached white cattle skull (sure, why not?). Each card depicts a neon maniac, and as he stoops to look at them, the door opens quietly in back of him. Cue the axe wielding deformed maniac standing over him as he looks at the axe wielding deformed maniac's card. The next thing you see is the axe going up and coming down, and another fisherman is quickly dispatched in typical scream screen style. I quickly reached for the DVD liner notes to see if I had missed something explaining the significance of using the trading cards. Nope. Okay, it looked like the director was going for ambiance there; no sense, but lots of ambiance. Perhaps he was aiming for a marketing tie-in: neon maniac trading cards, with bubble-gum; see the movie, and then trade them with your friends. Hmmm...maybe not, seeing this film was rated R.

I read more of the liner notes. ""...it's the neon maniacs, a group of ruthless, outrageously attired and made-up killers who emerge from beneath the Golden Gate Bridge to wreak havoc on helpless teenagers"" and fisherman too, apparently. ""Where the Maniacs come from is never explained, nor why they live so close to San Francisco Bay, considering that water...is the only thing that can harm them."" Wonderful, I thought, not only are they hideously deformed and fashion-phobic, they are dumb too. My favorite quote from the liner notes, however, would have to be this one: ""...and the producer now says, ""It was a much better script than a movie..."" That quote is a keeper.

And, yes, they do look like some devil's version of the Village People, except for that midget dinosaur, with the one eye in the middle of its head. What exactly is that thing?

After the teenage slaughter in the park, the cops, of course, do not believe the lone survivor. The lone survivor, played by Leilani Sarelle in a very subdued performance as Natalie, heads home and...jumps into the backyard pool for a dip. After watching her friends get beheaded, hung, and gleefully mutilated by the village people from hell, she puts on a bathing suit, in the middle of the night, and goes for a dip in the backyard pool. Did I mention that she was all alone and it was the middle of the night, and, oh yes, her friends were horribly mutilated by deformed and apparently dangerous criminals that could be, at that very moment, lurking in the bushes just waiting to kill her too? Oh, look, right on cue...there's that funny looking hairy cave-man looking neon maniac reaching out to her...and, oh, conveniently it started to rain.

Enter the stereotypic spoiled and precocious adolescent, who just so happens to be a budding horror director, sticking her nose into the mystery of the missing teenagers. Played by Donna Locke, the character of Paula is really annoying in that I told you so and I know better because I am rich and can afford all this camera equipment kind of way. With her baseball cap tilted to one side, and her strong willed determinism, I was hoping she would be gobbled up in no time by the midget dinosaur, but, as luck would have it, she was scripted to survive. And also to be smarter then the police; although they are smart enough to find the green goop that the monsters leave behind, only she is smart enough to follow the obvious trail of green goop droppings that leads to the big metal doors. No trading cards or cattle skull this time, just dead white pigeons in front of the doors. If any film ever cried out for a commentary track, this is the one.

Putting the green goop and dead white pigeons together, metaphorically, Paula comes back later that night with her really expensive video equipment that can shoot night scenes without a light source, and hides behind some bushes to stake out the metal doors. She watches as the neon maniacs leave their hiding place, only to be turned back by the rain. One of them trips into a puddle of water and starts bubbling, so she now knows their weakness. More terror ensues as a neon maniac goes after Paula while she is sleeping, but she quickly dispatches him with a water pistol, bucket of water, and the trusty standby, the bathtub. Why is it always so easy for stalking monsters to find their victims home addresses?

Paula, Natalie, and the token handsome but nerdish boyfriend, quickly devise a plan to arm every High School student with water pistols. I am not sure where they could have found so many water pistols in so short a time, but there they were, armed and ready, at the Sock Hop versus Alice Cooper wannabees band contest later that night at the High School. They, of course, gave everyone a water pistol, but unfortunately forgot to tell them when to use the darn things: so that plot device was conveniently forgotten when the neon maniacs showed up on the dance floor. A few dismemberments later, panic ensues, and the students are getting sliced and diced, and julienned in short order fashion. Paula finally grabs the fire hose, in plain view, and douses the monsters but good. Of course, in true scream screen logic, Natalie and the token handsome boyfriend, run away from the safety of that big wet water hose, and up a few flights of stairs to the Principal's Office, which, of course IS LOCKED because it is after hours and the principal has gone home for the night. Along the way, the graphic grue scene with the neon maniac surgeon stands out in an otherwise gore-lite film.

Now that the Principal's Office is unavailable (why did you head there anyway?), our frightened and apparently dumb teenagers are being hunted by more neon maniacs, so they decide to make out. Huh?

The police, in a 1950's styled these kids are crazy but what the hell we've got no other choice approach, along with the fire department, converge in front of the metal doors underneath Golden Gate Bridge. Whipping out their water pistols, and hoses, they opene the doors and search the surprisingly small storage space. Nothing is found, and the kids are derisively told to get the hell out of there. Of course, the obtuse detective in charge of this bizarre series of events, heads back into the creepy storage space without any backup and sans water pistol. Oh, yes, and do make sure to open the back doors on that ambulance, you know, the one with all the weird lights and sounds coming from it. He gets hooked, literally, and so ends this very strange film. Believe it or not.",1134950400,4,6562,4.636285468615649
211461,5,6300180247,"There is one virtue in having a movie that just jumps headlong into a mindless and disoriented story---at least there's no slow beginning to put you to sleep. Not coincidentally, this is the case with Neon Maniacs, a movie that involves a little maniac but virtually no neon. I remember as a young lad of about sixteen seeing bits and pieces of this movie, and since I had never again endeavored to look for it, until, by happenstance, now, I had begun to believe the movie to be something mythic. But no, it's real, right down to the latex masks. Apparently, these cataclysmic goons live inside a bridge, and they have a deck of Tarot cards with their likenesses. The Neon Maniacs are the Village People of the Horror world. You have Samurai Maniac, Biker Maniac, Army Maniac, Doctor Maniac, Indian Maniac, Monkey Maniac, Crossbow Maniac, Robo-Maniac, and the list just goes on and on.
Earlier on (like in the first five minutes) you have this pretty high school girl emerge unscathed from the massacre of her friends by the Neon Maniacs, because the Maniacs are chased away just before they can finish the last girl, by rain, because the Maniacs, for reasons unknown, turn to green slush when they come in contact with water. So, the pretty girl, the sole survivor, bravely goes back to school, where she is pestered about the disappearance of her friends, and then suspended from school because she claims monsters (the nefarious Neon Maniacs) as the culprits. Fortunately, her time spent lounging around the house gives us the opportunity to see her poolside in a bikini. Hoo-wah! Anyhoo, eventually she teams up with her boyfriend and a younger horror-fan girl, and they prepare to do battle with the Maniacs. This improvised warfare involves ponderously complicated strategies like water guns and fire hoses, and at one point, one of the Maniacs is actually driven back by a spilled cup plastic cup of beer or something. At one point, the younger horror fan expeditiously fires a hose at the Straight Jacket Maniac, and knocks his head clean off, like a pop-top on a big can of puke-colored slime. Throw into the action the big highschool ""Battle of the Bands"", featuring Jerkweed and the Sissy Mary Combo, and Twisted Sister Reject Band with the Loverboy rip-off lead singer. Oh, wait a minute, did I forget to mention that this move takes place in the very hairspray vortex of the 80's? This of course adds an additional level of difficulty to the old cheez-o-meter. But, guys, stay with me. Hang in there; I know you can do it. Skip back to the bikini scene if you have to, but keep at it.
In short, if you like horrible movies, you will love this movie. It has pretty much all of the key elements: Indiscernible plot, terrible acting, terrible music, Space Giants special effects and a pretty girl just to keep it interesting. More than that, the DVD is pretty inexpensive, so I personally cannot see any flaw in the equation.",1079913600,18,2936,4.736328125
211462,4,6300180247,"Neon Maniacs takes me back to my younger days when late night television was a veritable smorgasboard of underrated and highly enjoyable B horror films. This film makes me long for the days of USA Saturday Nightmares and TNT Monstervision. Set in San Francisco, this far fetched tale of crazed monsters on the rampage is a great way to recall those low budget horror masterpieces from the 80's. If you are looking for a film with big name actors, highly developed storylines, and million dollar FX then this film is probably not for you! If, however, you are searching for a fun way to waste some well earned R&R and love this film genre then look no farther than Neon Maniacs. For anyone who is a fan of B horror films I give this film 4 stars, and highly recommend it!",1075248000,14,770,4.468085106382978
211463,4,6300180247,"This movie has everything you need to make a great '80s horror film work.  Young, defenseless teenage girls for vicitms, great FX, and creative murder sequences (the acting abilities basically have no importance in these kind of movies, so don't waste your time trying to analyze the characters!) I remember this film as a child growing up in the '80s.  It was one of those movies you stay up until midnight to watch.  The Neon Maniacs consist of: ape. archer. slasher. soldier. axe. decapitator. juice. hangman. doc. samurai. mohawk. biker. All giving different forms of tourture to their vicitms of San Fran.  I urge you to see this film if you are a fan of the horror genre and if you are a fan of films like Basket Case, Prom Night, any Friday the 13th entry, and Waxwork.",1073520000,8,776,4.601449275362318
7803533,5,6300180247,"Let's get one thing straight; when I refer to a piece of cinema as garbage, I mean that in a highly complimentary way. I love movies. I love great movies, I love dumb movies, I love old movies, I love creepy movies, I love awful movies, I love sweet movies, I love stinky movies, I love lovable movies, I love plotless movies, I love gnarly movies, I love ha-ha movies, I love intelligent movies, I love ghastly movies, I love wonderful movies, I love movies that make me question why I love such questionable moviesokay, you get the picture.

There is a time and place for Schlock, Exploitation, and/or Z-Grade movies. Sometimes that time can be anytime depending on my mood/state of mind, but there's also a factor wherein if my day required a lot of pressing thought or hard work, I want to reward my brain and entertainment receptors by turning them off for awhile. In other words, I find it highly therapeutic to NOT watch a masterpiece. Bring on an antiblockbuster!

I'm aware that it may be offensive to some (including the filmmakers) to label a film as less than ""good"", but some films are beyond good, or any of those nice words we were taught in school. Keep in mind that, to me at least, ""bad' can equal one of the greatest films I've ever had the privilege of allowing it to change my life. Confused? I can respect that. I'm no Einstein, and, in my opinion, none of the above should be over-thought.

I have a great admiration for people who unselfconsciously set out to make films (provided that no one gets hurt in the process, mean-spirited people should not be allowed to exist in society let alone hold a movie camera), as long as they found it important to their vision of what someone else might like to see, I'll probably find it worth viewing.

Anyway, so I see the cover of this DVD on Amazon. Do I think, ""Wow, look at that artwork, this is probably a cinematic breakthrough; a Horror Film that better deliver the scares to meet my dialed-in expectations or I am going to be severely disappointed""?

Heck no! I think, ""Whoa, this looks like I may have possibly struck GOLD; those creeps on the cover look uncredible plus it's brilliantly and meaninglessly titled Neon Maniacs and I want to own this NOW because, well, if nothing less, it might stave off the yearning for self-medication another week"".

Alright then, at this point if you need plot details (I didn't), please see other reviews. This movie DELIVERED the good old bad goodies. It may not be healthy for fans of serious Horror, but will add ten years to the lives of those who seek Schlock.",1501718400,2,2577,4.543103448275862
7803534,5,6300180247,"The film itself looks fantastic: The image is sharp and clear without being so done over that it loses that distinctive 80s feel. Its anamorphic widescreen at 1.78:1 and contains one mono track, which does come in clear. The only extras are an interview with the makeup artist, trailer, and isolated music track, so wait for a good deal to grab this since you're not exactly paying for a lush package.

The film itself is pretty freaking wonderful. I assumed itd be kind of a trashy, pessimistic movie and was really happy to see I was wrong. The characters are likable, with one of the female leads reminding me of Tommy Jarvis in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter with her interest in horror movies and pluckiness when it comes to the bad guys. Theres a lot of humor and a nice amount of blood for the gorehounds, and the music (including the band in the movie) is gold.",1480291200,3,873,4.490566037735849
