Don't waste your money folks, not bloody, gory or even interesting (NOT SCARY AT ALL). As a kid, I did not enjoy this movie when it originally came out in theaters and as an adult, I did not enjoy it the second time around (on DVD). Dumpster material, I'm pushing the diminish button on this one (REMOVED FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH). Schroeder/Cult Movies Magazine & TV",1391472000,,493,4.428571428571429

8024051,3,B000294GE0,"Well, I was just going to give just a teaser for the film, but the editorial review pretty much spills the plot (so just pretend you did not read it). In 'The Godsend', Cyd Hayman and Malcolm Stoddard are the parents (Cyd is a woman) of four children; one being an infant. One day while out on a walk with the family they meet and befriend a pregnant woman and end up inviting her to their home. Oddly enough she ends up going into labor while she is there. The following morning, the couple finds themselves with a newborn baby and no mother. In a failed attempt to locate or even find out who the mother was, they end up adopting the infant, especially since their own infant mysteriously dies in it's crib that it happened to be sharing with the new infant. As the new addition to the family gets older, strange accidents start happening to the other children resulting in death. This also begins to drive a wedge between the husband and wife as one is suspicious of the new child and one sees the child as a 'godsend'. I actually enjoyed this movie both times I watched it. I should, however, point out a few things that some will find instead as a detraction. This movie, although of a horror subject, is paced and scripted like a familial drama; meaning it takes its time. Although this movie is rated 'R' (and that in and of itself is a mystery), it could have, and I believe did, play on TV without having anything cut. I do believe that very fact led to negative reviews as the movie was marketed as an Omen type movie which it is not. 'The Godsend' is also frankly a depressing movie which takes its subject seriously; do not expect any cheese, humor, or for that matter, gore in this one. One other importatant note is that the plot is obvious and this not a movie about figuring out the plot, but about how it plays out. One of the things I did like was the performance of the little girl who plays the older Bonnie, the godsend child. She can come off as innocent and devious without being overt; and talk about a wicked look in a child's face. Hayman and Stoddard give good performances as the parents as does the girl playing the oldest daughter. The script, although a little weak at times, does maintain itself and gives Hayman and Stoddard something with which they can work. Angela Pleasence gives a creepy if not effective performance as the pregnant woman. I did enjoy 'The Godsend', but I can certainly understand that this movie is not for everybody and feel that an understanding about this film should hopefully avoid disappointment if you know what to expect. One other note: if you find films that involve the death of children particularly disturbing, you may want to avoid this movie.--Bob",1104278400,10,2718,4.4929292929292926
