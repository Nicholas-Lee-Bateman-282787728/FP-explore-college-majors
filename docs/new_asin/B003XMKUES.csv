4217813,5,B003XMKUES,This was an excellent documentary of how Vietnam was and its effects on the soldiers.  It was very detailed and graphic which doesn't sugar coat the stress and difficulties the soldiers had to endure.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in this long war.,1423958400,,263,4.822222222222222

4217816,3,B003XMKUES,"It's OK but not great. Lots of repeat film clips and mostly made up of DOD 'rah-rah' films all with gov't. bias.
With the U.S. investing sooo much time, money, supplies amd most important, American lives.....how did we lose?
This is what happens when assanine politicians try to run a war....a lota' people die for nothing. Film....not bad for the price and if you like watching mostly government made films.",1304121600,11,408,4.8428571428571425
4217817,5,B003XMKUES,"I have seen them all...but it really does not get better than this!  Starting from the French disaster at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 all the way to the final American pull out in April of 1975, this collection does not miss a beat! Many of the other DVD collections out there are packaged in beautiful tin boxes, or with attractive, flashy covers. This 8 DVD collection does not have to do this. There are many scenes that I have never in the twenty years of watching anything related to Vietnam even knew existed! The music that accompanies each scene actually enhances what you are watching, instead of distracts and annoys the viewer! We are talking about 36 very worthwhile hours here!  It's worth every second! This is where the ""Screaming Eagles"" story is actually told by men of the 101st Airborne Division. Incredibly, this includes exclusive home footage donated by Vietnam Veterans themselves to enhance this production. Covert Operations are covered as well. ""Shadow Warriors"" is the true story of America's Special Operations men, also known as ""Black Ops.""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-War-within/dp/1741962099/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The War within</a>&nbsp;These Vietnam Warriors, i.e. SOG Seal Teams, Marine Force Reconnaissance, Ranger and Green Beret teams were critical to the code that today in Iraq and Afghanistan our Special Operation forces live and die by. The complete story of the air war over North Vietnam and the battles for the ""Hill Fights and Central Highlands"" in South Vietnam are included. Equal time is given to the Naval War, both off the coast of Vietnam as well as the PBR boats and Armored Troop Carriers in the Mekong delta, known as the ""River Rats."" The 1968 ""Tet Offensive"" and it's political ramifications in the U.S. are also explored. Do not miss this one!",1294963200,28,1852,5.274576271186441

8408390,4,B003XMKUES,Yes. Ho did this in a deadly land reform that year in North Vietnam. Understand this fact (mentioned in Ken Burns's new book Vietnam--also available at amazon)before you watch of this interesting stuff. The North Vietnamese were worthy of being stopped in the 60's!,1516579200,,265,5.045454545454546

8408395,5,B003XMKUES,"Great set. The first DVD was a bit boring but from then on the rest were very informative and entertaining. A lot of information and great archival footage of the war. Worth seeing but beware, it's ten long DVd's. It'll take some time to see it all.",1477872000,,249,4.319148936170213

8408397,2,B003XMKUES,"This was a Christmas gift for my husband who is a Vietnam Navy Veteran.  He said there is very little about the Navy.  Also, there was a lot of stuff about WWII in the collection.  This product is not as advertised.  There were a lot of repeat episodes too.  Would not recommend.",1456963200,,279,4.288461538461538
