8260702,5,6301962834,I bought this set as a two hour Laser Disk but it didn't have the Pacific Frontiers material included. We loved it and to avoid LD obsolescence copied onto Two VHS tapes. Now with my DVD recorder connected directly to my LD I can copy to DVD directly with much better quality. It will always be a great piece in our DVD library.,1344038400,,328,4.222222222222222
