8342094,5,B001TND12G,"I own this course and another seven or eight by Brad Carlton. He is a phenomenal teacher. As another reviewer said, Brad embeds every moment of video conveying new nuggets of useful information. His CAGED course is one of the best guitar education purchases I've ever made. It puts chords and scales and progressions all together in a way even an average intermediate player like me can understand. His approach is conversational and engaging...like you are in the room with him...and always exudes the confidence and enthusiasm you need to pick up an idea and move to the next level.
This is a course for the motivated learner, with solid foundational concepts that you acquire progressively through practice.",1451174400,,710,5.02542372881356
8342095,4,B001TND12G,"I heard and read that it (Caged System) is supposed to make the fret board easy to navigate and learning chords and arpeggios much intuitive.  I haven't tried using it yet, but I am planning to find a teacher who can incorporate it into my lessons.",1405555200,,248,4.391304347826087
8342096,1,B001TND12G,"The instructor on this DVD refers to the chord charts and other supporting files frequently during lessons.
Inside the DVD case there are instructions for downloading supporting files. You are directed to a web address with a short form to fill out. ""Look for an email with a download link within minutes"" is printed on the inside of the DVD case. I waited a day and tried again. I emailed Guitar Sherpa directly. It has been a week and I have had no response from this company. I am returning this DVD.",1345852800,,503,4.478260869565218
8342097,3,B001TND12G,"I think the information is good in this. The problem I have is that it is so boring.  It would be nice if Brad was a little excited about playing guitar.  He seems to have have come out of a band similar to the one in the Blues Brothers who were rescued from playing in a club inside a Holiday Inn.  I cannot remember the name of the band but I think it was something like the Mellotones.  Anyway, the information is good but it is really hard to sit through.",1331596800,,459,4.010989010989011
8342098,5,B001TND12G,"The CAGED system is something I stumbled upon late in life. I had heard about it but thought it was a gimic and that site reading and pentatonic patterns were enough...WRONG! Looking at the fretboard as Mr. Carlton presents it really opens up so much understanding of how the guitar is laid out. It will increase your understaanding of scales, arppegios and postion playing to no end. With a straight forward  approach to teaching, this instructor will make light bulbs go off in your head. After focusing on the major groupings (CAGED) you will then readily slip into the minor groupings (EDCAG). Seriously, you won't look at your guitar neck the same way ever again....it becomes a world of possibilities. Highly reccomended for those with a little playing under their belt. If you can comfortably play barre chords up the neck....your ready for this one.",1283212800,8,857,4.910344827586207
8342099,5,B001TND12G,I own this course and find it to be quite helpful to me in my understanding of the Caged System for the guitar. This is a Guitar Instructional course that I would recommend to any guitar player who has the basic information and some basic theory already in hand. Brad Carlton covers a lot of information while he is demonstrating the concepts and you might find yourself stopping and going back over what he is saying so understanding some basic guitar theory would be recommended to get the most out of this course. At the same time the concepts concerning the Caged System for the guitar are easy to grasp the way that Mr. Carlton lays it down for you. Very recommended for the early intermediate to intermediate guitar player who wishes to expand his Theory knowledge on his way to mastering the guitar fretboard.,1283126400,9,816,4.63448275862069
