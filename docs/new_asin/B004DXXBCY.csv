He grew on me and the family was so genuine and so funny I just couldn't get them out of my head. Every character was so well played that they seemed like a real family. Rebecca Front as the mother was my favorite. She usually plays characters that are not very likable, but she overcomes that and shines as the center of the whole shebang. I would gladly have watched many more seasons of this lovely show.",1517616000,,525,4.422680412371134
8426201,1,B004DXXBCY,"Sick and tired of the ""Entertainment Business' passing of Trannies as women.  It's deceitful.  BTW, IDGAFF if you are offended by my comment.  i'm offended by this BS.",1510531200,,167,4.892857142857143
8426202,5,B004DXXBCY,"Humor is so subjective; we happened to be the kind of people who found this strange little sitcom so hilarious that we decided to ration the episodes, treating ourselves to just one at a time for our nightly 'tonic.' By the middle of Season 1, we found it not only laugh-out-loud funny but the related characters (especially the off-again-on-again fiancee Clive) grew very darkly messed up, so viewing became a strange combination of anguished anxiety (heightened by all the action being confined to the wonderfully pokey and claustrophobic interior of Grandma's 'lounge')and hilarity, like old-good Woody Allen. We absolutely loved it and were sorry to see the end.",1510272000,,666,5.175925925925926
8426203,5,B004DXXBCY,"one  of the very best comic portrayals of a dysfunctional family ever.

failure.things always go from hopeful to bad to worse. awkward and
heartbreaking , funny and sad. genius. wonderful. i never wanted it to end.",1507248000,,286,4.607843137254902

8426207,5,B004DXXBCY,Simon Amstell is a joy.  I wanted to watch this series so badly that I hacked my computer to get it to play Region 2 DVDs.  It was well worth it.,1436486400,,145,3.6451612903225805

8426209,5,B004DXXBCY,"Simon Amstell is full of angst. Gay, neurotic, Jewish and drop-dead gorgeous, the man to whom John Barrowman once  said ""Are you trying to outgay me?"" (see YouTube) has written this gem of a family sitcom. Described by one critic as ""beyond the cringe"", its humour is so spot on that you want to laugh at it and cry with Simon. His depiction of a dysfunctional family, of people who want to care but can't show it, walks the narrow line between comedy and tragedy to perfection. A masterpiece.",1337904000,7,493,4.53932584269663
