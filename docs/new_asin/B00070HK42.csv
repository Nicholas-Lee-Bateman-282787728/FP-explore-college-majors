2199062,4,B00070HK42,"The most recent issue of FILMFAX Magazine (Autumn, 2007) includes an interesting article which claims that this movie was one of JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald's 'trigger' films.

Oswald's widow went on record (in the Warren Report) stating that Oswald watched this film twice in 24 hours when it was shown on a local Dallas TV station, just over a month before Kennedy was killed.  Researchers have verified that ""We Were Strangers"" was, indeed, screened twice in Dallas over a weekend in October of 1963.  Following Kennedy's death, the film was effectively buried---it wasn't shown again on TV and was never released on video.  It was only released on DVD about five years ago.  Even the official PR copy for the DVD neglects to mention these facts.

Nobody knows if Oswald ever saw ""The Manchurian Candidate"".  But he did absolutely see ""We Were Strangers"".  Wondering what he was looking for in this movie, and wondering how this movie might've influenced history, make watching this film an interesting experience.",1188864000,5,1020,5.029761904761905
2199063,1,B00070HK42,"I bought this movie for its historic value. Practically no film exists that covers Cuba during the late 1920s and early 1930s. Although I knew this was a US interpretation of the period and that it was made in the 1950s, I had hoped for some nod to the Cuban revolution of 1933. In fact, it is an overly dramatic love story of revolutionaries fighting for some undefined revolution who dig a tunnel from the home of an innocent and beautiful orphaned young woman. The rest is entirely predictable. She falls in love with one of the ardent young insurrectionists who is killed. Cuba is only some exotic backdrop for the age-old story of youthful promise and sacrifice. For today's taste, the acting is blatant, overdrawn, sappy, and predictable.",1167782400,3,744,4.775193798449612
2199064,4,B00070HK42,"In between making the classics ""Treasure of the Sierre Madre"" (1948) and ""The Asphalt Jungle"" (1950), John Huston made ""We Were Strangers,"" which virtually vanished and was never released on VHS and seldom shown on television. At the time of the film's release, which was right at the beginning of the HUAC Committee and American  political paranoia, it predictably received unfavorable and questionable attention. It was released in April of 1949 but audiences were perplexed by it and it quickly vanished from theaters.

Based on the overthrow of Cuban dictator Geraldo Machado Morales in 1933, the story is about a group of revolutionaries who plot to bring down their corrupt government. China (pronounced Cheena) Valdez witnesses her brother's murder after he distributes leftist pamphlets and vows that she will kill his assassin. At his funeral, however, she is persuaded to join an underground group whose motives are more carefully orchestrated. China's house is next door to a cemetery and the leader of the group (John Garfield) devises a scheme to assasinate an official whose family plot is in the cemetery and detonate a bomb at the man's funeral thereby killing as many officials as possible. To do this, they must dig a tunnel from China's house to the cemetery. Most of the movie is concentrated on the digging of the tunnel as Garfield and Jones' develop a romantic interest in each other. However, the film never lets the romantic issues overpower the film's basic purposes of depicting the desperateness of the Cuban terrorists and the film ends with a violent and exciting shoot-out sequence.

The film often suffers in a few places from sluggish pacing but the performances are all first rate. Jennifer Jones, doing a convincing Cuban accent, is radiant but intense as China and has good chemisty with Garfield. The supporting players are unusually fine. Pedro Armendariz, as the corrupt police chief, is deliciously menacing. Look for silent greats Gilbert Roland and Ramon Navarro in strong supporting parts as members of the resistance. Look for a cameo appearance by director John Huston who appears as a bank teller.

Many of the film's outdoor scenes are shot against rear projections, which are quite noticable. The film, however, achieves an almost documentary-like feel with its stark black and white photography.

This high definition dvd transfer is very good with excellent contrast and a minimum of softness and grain. There are a few noticable specks and scratches but nothing to warrant any serious complaints. Sadly, there are no extra features provided.",1110240000,12,2592,5.161904761904762
2199065,5,B00070HK42,"At long last a forgotten blockbuster film from Hollywood's Golden Era will soon be released on DVD! Passed up for re-issue on video this action packed, star studded epic will leave an unforgettable impression. Starring Jennifer Jones as the sultry cuban belle and revolutionary, ""China"" Valdes, John Garfield as Tony Fenner, a courageous Cuban-American revolutionary, Pedro Armendariz as Ariete, the ruthless chief of dictator Machado's police and co-starring Gilbert Roland, Morris Ankrum, Ramon Novarro and others. Filmed entirely in Havana, Cuba in 1948 and released in 1949, this film is based on a true story of the Cuban underground fight against the dictatorship of Machado,during the final days of his regime in 1933.

""We Were Strangers"" is definitely one of Hollywood's best action films, virtually forgotten but luckily will soon be available.

I highly recommend this film. Do not miss it as it will definitely become one of your favorites!",1104019200,14,952,5.34

8044404,5,B00070HK42,"One of Houston's lesser-known classics, We Were Strangers is a handsome, beautifully crafted B&W gem of the 1940s, when B&W film had reached its technical zenith. I saw this movie in an art house in LA once, and it had so much depth it was almost 3D.

But the real quality of this film is the acting. Garfield at his height is a force of nature, exuding drama with every word and movement. This is powerful stuff. No one today, and few then, had that kind of screen presence. He was truly one of the greats, not least because in real life he was a man of great integrity. His career came to an abrupt end when he dared to stand up to the HUAC witch hunt and was subsequently blacklisted. Unable to work, he died shortly thereafter of a heart attack, struck down in his prime by a gang of tacky far-right political hacks led by a jumped-up demagogue named McCarthy, a shyster lawyer named Cohn, and a sleazy weasel who ended up in prison for fraud. They were all later exposed as frauds, but not before they had destroyed many innocent lives.

The other cast members are also very fine. Jones is very moving and Gilbert Roland gives an indelible performance as a Cuban revolutionary.

Houston's direction is very surefooted & the story builds to an exciting but very grim climax. The movie ends on a bittersweet note. As in life, few things of value, especially the fight for justice & freedom, come without a steep price.",1476144000,,1421,4.478764478764479

8044407,4,B00070HK42,"WE WERE STRANGERS (1949) was Columbia's attempt to combine street fighting with love and politics.  Story, set in 1933 Havana, concerns attempts of average citizens to overthrow brutal police-state government.  Jennifer Jones and John Garfield, both on loan from other studios, are fine as budding revolutionaries, Jones especially so as mousy bank secretary who (spoiler) takes to the guns by movie's end.  Occasional use of exterior day shots adds credibility, and ominous mood generally holds, but this 106-minute feature does not quite have the Warner Bros.-like tautness it ought to.

8044408,3,B00070HK42,"The history of Cuba had been replete with struggles against tyranny well before the boys of the Sierra Madres, you know the Castro Brothers, beloved Che the Argentine internationalist heart of the revolution, the lost Frank Paisa man of the cities, and all their brethren who took down Batista in the late 1950s. Took him down almost without a fight at the end when the masses waited in the cities and farms for the boys (and girls, don't forget Haydee Santamaria) to work their way to Havana town. Of course everybody remembers, or should, the legendary 19th century revolutionary Jose Marti, celebrated in story and song, still honored in Cuba today and his struggle to get rid of the bloody Spanish oppressors and the later struggle in the 1930s against the hyenas, the Machado, the hyenas who were replaced later by the that self-same Batista. So the island of Cuba has been no stranger to the struggle for freedom (and the Bay of Pigs-style operations to thwart such struggles) the film under review, We Were Strangers, demonstrates in its depiction of the fight against the hyenas in the 1930s mentioned above. Of course this film which was released in 1949 could not have dealt with the regime that followed, Batistas, since this film is centered on the 1930s struggles. That later regime necessitated the Castro boys taking up arms in the hills after the initial defeat at Moncado.

Here is the skinny. The hyenas took over in the 1920s and ran rampart over the country and for the foreign, mainly the United States, interests in the sugar production. (Cuba was a classic monoculture colonial and semi-colonial country around the sugar crop, and to a lesser extent still is). The younger generation of professionals and a smattering of workers and peasants decided that they had had enough and as was the norm in that day, and not just in Cuba, created underground revolutionary organizations in order to overthrow the strongman. A familiar enough story particularly in the 20th century.

And so the young upstarts and old freedom-lovers created an organization and devised some ideas about how they could overthrow the regime. But then they ran up against the problem every revolutionary organization faces in times of serious oppression, the passivity or resignation of the masses. The question for such organizations then becomes what to do-wait until the masses are so oppressed they will rise on their own or to nudge the masses into activity by an exemplary action aimed at the heart of the regime. Well our boys, most of them, opted for not waiting, for action now.

Of course that decision entailed making a plan to create the biggest splash possible and to a great extent the core of this film centers on the creation of that splash promoted by an angry young revolutionary who had been in exile for a while (his father had fled Cuba after some problems which caused Fenner (played by John Garfield) endless shame and a need to bring back to his family name. The gist of the plan, seemingly foolproof, was to kill some well-known top governmental official and then set a massive explosion at his funeral which was sure to be attended by the president and the major players in government. Wipe them out at one blow and set the masses in motion for their freedom. Maybe in a cakewalk. By hook or by crook the group that Fenner recruits to do the preparation and digging of a tunnel underneath the graveside complete their work under tremendous pressure. The target (a Senate President) is duly killed and Well, and the guy in NOT to be buried where he was supposed to be. Scratch Plan A, plan B is to get Fenner out of the country but he is subject to a wide scale manhunt and is finally cornered and killed after a heroic individual struggle not to be taken alive. Shortly thereafter the freedom forces do overthrow the hyenas and set up the next level of struggle in Cuban history.

Oh yeah, this is a Hollywood production after all, a 1940s production and there naturally has to be some romantic interest to keep the action from being too tedious. So enter China (played by Jennifer Jones), the sister of a fallen revolutionary who is intimately involved in the plan, and gets intimately involved with Fenner (1940s intimately film involved). That involvements shifts both their motivations slightly as they now want to struggle so that they can raise a family in freedom, not an unworthy motive, no question. But also one where a certain softness set in which the security forces were able to exploit in order to corner Fenner. China was let to speak his eulogy, to write his epitaph in the then new Cuba.  Fenner died heroically but if any cautionary tale is to be taken from this film then it is once again that isolated revolutionary action in lieu of mass struggle is ultimately futile. That wisdom would surely be at the top of the list.",1411516800,,4861,4.74792899408284
8044409,3,B00070HK42,"The fellows probably loved it, it has an excellent cast and great acting but I was not aware that this was strictly a political thriller ""without much romance in it.""  (One should never judge a DVD by its cover). I think there is a great deal of suffering and sacrifice in the subversive plot and a bit of romance would have made it more palatable to the ladies, that's all.

8044410,5,B00070HK42,"This is one of the forgotten A film noirs of the 40's,with excellent acting and cinematography. It is a political thriller with sad overtunes which remines one of the Spanish Civil War and Hamingway's For Whom the Bells Toll.  Also, it is ironic that Cuba, like most Latin countries, has never been mature to develop a democracy.  After the dictatorship in 1933, which is the subject of this movie, came Castro with his brutal communist dictatorship which has been much worse than the 'right wing' dictatorships of the past. And we are going toward the same fate here in the USA.",1354233600,,579,4.7227722772277225
8044411,5,B00070HK42,"Released in 1949, WE WERE STRANGERS had the misfortune to run into the Communist Witchhunt on two counts. The first was actor John Garfield, a liberal who defied the House Unamerican Activities Committee at the height of its dark powers. The second was the film itself, which a presented a group of leftist Cuban militants in a sympathetic light as they worked up a terrorist plot to overthrow a repressive right-wing government. Garfield was blacklisted by the film industry for his refusal to play ball with HUAC and he died of heart attack at age 39 in 1952. WE WERE STRANGERS was not as popular as director John Huston's earlier or later movies, it received mixed reviews at the time, and it quickly disappeared from theatres. The rare television showing aside, the film virtually disappeared for fifty years--and particularly so after the assasination of John F. Kennedy in 1963.

The story is based on the 1933 overthrow of right-wing Cuban dictator Gerardo Machado y Morales, who was ultimately toppled from power by United States influences working Cuba--which is exactly what the film shows.  China Valdez (Jennifer Jones) witnesses the murder of her brother by a government official and is radicalized as a result.  She is determined to murder her brother's killer, but she falls into a group insurrectionists who have a wider plan: the overthrow of the government itself. The team, which is merely a cell of a larger organization, includes Cuban-American John Fenner (John Garfield), Armondo (Pedro Armendariz), Guillermo (Gilbert Roland), and ""the chief"" (Roman Novarro.)  They plan to dig a tunnel from China's house to a nearby cemetary, where they will plant a bomb; then, when they assasinate a notable figure and his funeral draws dignitaries--including the president--to the funeral, they will kill them all with the explosion.

The film is unexpectedly brutal, gritty, and noir-ish for 1949; it feels much more like a film from the late 1950s than a film from the late 1940s.  The cell members discuss whether or not it is right to kill innocent women and children in order to topple the government; somewhat later, when the target of the assasination is revealed, one of the cell members is upset to find he actually knows the man they plan to kill in order to draw the president to the funeral.  To further complicate the plot, John and China fall in love, but China becomes an issue for the terrorists when she accidentally draws the attentions of the same man who killed her brother.  There is not a false note in the cast.  The notion of Jennifer Jones playing a Cuban woman is off-putting in the abstract, but she gives one of the best performances of her career; Garfield, Roland, and Novarro are memorable, but this very much her film.

Several sources state that Lee Harvey Oswald watched WE WERE STRANGERS at least twice in October of 1963, about a month before he assasinated President John F. Kennedy, and his wife Marina later reported that he had been greatly excited by the film. There has been a rumor that the film had a copycat effect on Oswald, who had suspected ties to Cuba, in his decision to kill Kennedy. It will certainly be of interest to the many who study the Kennedy assasination. Whatever the case, it is a memorable film, an often powerful film, and one that I strongly recommend to fans of its stars and directors--and to movie fans in general.
