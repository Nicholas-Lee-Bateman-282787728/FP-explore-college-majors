I do not speak Spanish.",1366416000,,106,4.3
8034023,2,B0002X7H4W,"The quality is bad, bad. it was merely scanned off a VHS and there are even frames missing from some scenes.",1341878400,,108,4.190476190476191
8034024,1,B0002X7H4W,"This late 1950s Spanish film is a retelling of the Faust tale.  This time, a devil with Jewish imagery (Fernando Fernan Gomez) makes a pact with an old lady who is rejuvenated in the form of Mexican film star Maria Felix (whose voice is dubbed by a Spanish actress, except when she sings a bolero by Agustin Lara).  Maria Felix is very over-the-top in this film, the direction is undistinguished, and the production values are on the mediocre side (like in many 1950s Spanish commercial films). Worst of all, its boring. This is for diehard fans only and the Vanguard DVD of an old Spanish film is of characteristically poor quality.",1214265600,2,633,4.693693693693693
