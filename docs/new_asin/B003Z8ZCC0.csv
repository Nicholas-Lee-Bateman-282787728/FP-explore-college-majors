8410023,5,B003Z8ZCC0,"And the secret word is . . . ""fun."" It's been more than 50 years since Groucho Marx's ""game show"" You Bet Your Life premiered, and it still holds up. And still holds lots of laughs. It's amazing to watch him banter with his guests, many of whom are in obvious awe of being in the presence of the Great Man. And it's that bantering-filled with double entendres-that's the real star here. This three-disc box set features 16 episodes of the show, along with special bonus tracks, including two nifty episodes of The Hollywood Palace, one of which reunites host Groucho with his frequent co-star Margaret Dumont.  Hooray for Captain Spaulding!",1293926400,7,640,4.7657657657657655
