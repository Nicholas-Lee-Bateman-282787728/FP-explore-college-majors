I loved the first season, and I still love the second season. I can watch each episode over and over again. I love the cast and the chemistry they have.",1440288000,,311,4.032258064516129

6080799,5,B00GJTKVT6,"It's not easy to run an airline.
Especially when the flagship of your air fleet is a DC-3 that first took flight before World War II.
Oh, and you're trying to run this airline in the wilds of northwest Canada where weird weather is a constant companion and it sometimes gets so cold that aircraft can literally fall out of the sky because oil freezes solid and wings ice up.
Welcome to 'Arctic Air,' a wonderful Canadian series about the lives and loves of the men and women who spend half their lives in the skies and the other half trying to navigate the often unfathomable world of human relationships.
Starring Adam Beach and Pascale Hutton with a great supporting cast and some very sharp writing, 'Arctic Air' is an action/adventure series that - despite some really endearing characters - fell victim to government budget cutters who slashed the CBC's production funds and forced its cancellation. Shame, really, because this excellent series highlighted the rugged beauty of the Canadian Northwest Territory and the resilience of the people who call it home. It also gave many First Nations actors and writers an opportunity to display their talents to a wide audience, something that is not often done.
This second installment in the series, which only lasted three years, features some hair-raising adventures and some very interesting plot twists as the men and women of Arctic Air try to keep the airline flying in the face of a sagging economy, stiff competition and some off-kilter romantic situations. There is humor as well as action in this series and the characters are believable.
I enjoyed it very much and highly recommend it.",1427155200,5,1647,4.906810035842294

6080802,5,B00GJTKVT6,"If youve read Late Nights on Air by Elizabeth Hay then viewing Yellowknife, the setting for this CBC TV Series, from the air gives you a birds eye view of a landscape so vividly described in the novel. The show draws on the famous daring-do of the Canadian Norths Bush Pilots who fly and land anywhere in any weather in their float planes or on skis in a territory where compasses tend to spin round and round so close to the magnetic pole. For airplane buffs the show is a museum collectors dream with float planes and single-engine Beechcraft. The venerable DC3 is prominently flown.

CBC is at pains to show off its star attraction in this series, Adam Beach as Bobby Martin though until he goes on a diet and spends some time in a gym he should think twice about exposing his flabby midriff. The family run airline at the centre of this show lurches from crisis to crisis as it follows the lives of its pilots, mechanics, and office staff on the ground and in the air. The cast plays an eclectic mix of missfits such as one would expect to show up in the North. Interesting to see Nathaniel Arcand who plays a good guy on Heartland playing a heavy here. For actors bad guys are often more fun.

Just watched the last three episodes last night. Alas there will be no resolution of the cliffhanger rescue that ended Season 3. Not only was the show cancelled without warning but the sets, costumes, and props were sold off in almost ungodly haste. The CBC Radio Drama Department has been cut and original CBC TV Drama is rapidly disappearing. CBC Sports are gone, whats left?",1402531200,,1576,4.46875

6080804,1,B00GJTKVT6,"First two discs in set were great, third disc would not play, skipped, pixilated and just wouldn't play the first episode on the disc. In fairness the last two on the disc did play just fine. I cannot return or exchange this item so am very disappointed.",1394236800,,254,4.425531914893617

8623895,5,B00GJTKVT6,The CBC made a mistake in cancelling this excellent series at the end of season 3. Why on earth?  I fell in love with YellowKnife NWT Canada and its inhabitants at Arctic Air. Spectacular scenery every episode.  Every episode imparted northern atmosphere.  The ensemble acting was outstanding! The characters and dialogue authentic.  Special Effects very well done.  I miss the people already and look forward to watching the 3 series over again down the road.,1459209600,,460,5.08
8623896,5,B00GJTKVT6,"Season two pretty much takes up where first season left off.  Adam Beach returns in the role of Bobby Martin.  The Arctic Air family faces tragedy coming and going beginning with a near fatal plane crash that almost kills four of its own.  The family is also confronted with raging forest fires, ruthless diamond thieves and a drug addled rock star whose only interest in life is getting the drugs he needs to sustain his habit and at any cost never mind whose life is put in jeopardy.  The rugged scenery of the Northwest Territories continues to form the backdrop for this well acted series with believable story lines.",1456963200,,621,4.669724770642202
