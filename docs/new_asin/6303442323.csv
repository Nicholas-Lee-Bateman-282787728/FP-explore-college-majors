7846507,5,6303442323,I enjoyed this long miniseries that filled in my almost non-existent knowledge of the event when it occurred and provided some insight into life as a hostage held in a geopolitical stalemate.,1482451200,,191,5.0

7846509,5,6303442323,This was so long ago I don't know how many people would remember.  I wish history teachers would get these videos of world events and show them in their classes.,1416009600,,161,4.366666666666666
7846510,4,6303442323,"A heartbreakingly honest, and telling tale of the Western hostages who were released from Middle Eastern prisons in the mid 80s.  Played so well by the excellent cast, one tends to forget that they're not, in fact, the actual men who were imprisoned.
  It's especially sad that here we are, some 32 years later, and these atrocities have escalated, rather than subsided. Still, the film has much for us to learn, not only about the tenacity of the tortured, teachers and journalists, who were imprisoned so unjustly; but also that of their families who suffered by missing them for so many years.",1409788800,,596,4.823529411764706
7846511,5,6303442323,Cannot imagine what these poor people went through for years. The cavalier attitude of the authorities never took into account what they were suffering. The British reporter was afraid of cockroaches and ended up eating them off his chest. Yuchh! Bonding with each other kept them alive. Meanwhile the authorities in the US were shown preoccupied with Tanya Harding's skating antics and Kurt Cobain's suicide. Priorities a little askew. Well acted.,1307577600,,448,5.323943661971831
7846512,5,6303442323,"It is funny to be writing about a VHS videotape production in this day and age of its approaching obsolescence.  This most certainly needs to be released on DVD at some point, especially considering that two of its stars are Academy Award winners -- Colin Firth and Kathy Bates.  I cannot think of anything that has shown the misery, fear, stripping away of dignity, and ultimate triumph of the human spirit better than this film.  It had to cover a lot of territory in under 2 hours and did so incredibly well.  Terrific acting helped, most certainly, with this stellar cast. It is still quite relevant to today and many of the real people depicted are alive and well and productive members of society as I write this.
Unless HBO plans to reissue this onto DVD, not many will get the opportunity to see this small gem of a film and the first-rate performances that make up its appeal.",1301356800,5,885,4.547169811320755
7846513,5,6303442323,"Brilliant acting from Colin Firth & Kathy Bates. Also the guy who plays Terry Anderson looks just like him.

Miles better than that ""Blind Flight"" bollocks starring Ken Barlow's son.",1233100800,,182,5.066666666666666
7846514,3,6303442323,"This movie is about the Civil War in Lebanon in the 1980's.  During this time US citizens in specific were being targeted, over 50 Western citizens were taken hostage during this time and exposed to appauling conditions, and treated like animals.  Back home however while the detainees are struggling for their lives, the victims families are struggling too- for the justice that will see their loved ones returned to safety.  This film is a very emotional journey, be prepared few a few teary eyes!",1015718400,9,499,4.916666666666667
