8052038,2,B0007UZMWO,"If this is an exercise video she should have worked both sides of the body, which she does not on several occasions. She goes through alot of basic belly dance moves but it does not sound like she has any idea how she does them. For example she explains a basic shimmy by telling you to just shake, not what the knees are doing or what should be relaxed or what muscles to use.  She explains a freeze by telling you to twitch, just let everything vibrate (I think that would be a seziure). Alot of things I think she is just plain wrong about like, holding your breath while you undulate and sinking you chest back while you do a shoulder shimmy.  I was really suprised this was made in 2005. It really does look like a home made video from the 70's and the ""teaching"" is very vague.  Also the jacket says video contains a featurette on the making of the costumes.  I guess that was the part where she tells you to go buy and pattern and make a costume. In conclusion, don't bother even renting this one.",1245369600,,1004,4.2408376963350785
8052039,3,B0007UZMWO,"Despite the videography is outdated, the teaching is excellent for beginners to belly dancing. If you are on the market to learn steps, isolate muscles Ms. Diamond's instruction is clear and better than I received in live class. Don't expect flashy images or good music. Focus on the basic moves, then you can purchase more advanced workouts.",1187395200,,342,5.017543859649122
8052040,5,B0007UZMWO,"Susan was my first belly dance teacher so even though this video is likely the re-release of her first video and was produced very simple, etc., I adore her.

Susan's father is from Iraq, just FYI, which partly lead to her interest in belly dance.

She is one of the most beautiful belly dancers in the U.S., so I thought it necessary to at least enlighten some of the negative reviews below.  thank you",1152835200,,403,4.418918918918919
8052041,2,B0007UZMWO,"I own many bellydancing DVD's but this one is the most disspointing and basic one I have.

Miss Diamond does not come across as a professional bellydancer and as long as you know nothing about bellydancing than this DVD could be for you, but be warned IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY.",1135382400,11,278,4.346153846153846
8052042,1,B0007UZMWO,"If this is the same Susan Diamond at the early 90's ""Belly dancing Lessons with Susan Diamond"" re-released, I can honestly tell you that buying this will be a HUGE waste of money. The music drones her out and after two years of not seeing the video I can still remember how dumb I thought it was even as a beginner.",1133222400,7,315,4.180327868852459
