8010931,4,B0001DMXAG,"They're hip.  They're cool.  They're California dreamy.  They're Totally Spies !  Once again Sam, Clover, and Alex scour the globe chasing down bad guys, cracking some cases, and getting on with their social lives, too.

This DVD, which still isn't much to talk about, has three more of your favorite episodes and mine, plus the second part of the episode ""A Spy is Born"" to follow up the first part in the first volume.  I also liked the episode where the girls get medieval ... in Medieval times, of course !

Like ""Powerpuff Girls"" and ""Atomic Betty,"" or even ""Winx Club"" and ""Kim Possible,"" you can bet that the female league can kick some tail, too.",1128384000,2,654,4.586206896551724
8010932,4,B0001DMXAG,"This show is great if you've got little ones at home and you're looking for a show that you can really get into yourself.  This dvd has no special or extra features, which is why I gave the dvd a 4 instead of a 5.  There are four episodes on this dvd:

THE GETAWAY:

The title show, the girls are sent on a vacation from their busy world of spy work.  But, even on vacation, they can't seem to escape work, and they end up involved in a strange mystery.

THE ERASER:

STUCK IN THE MIDDLE AGES WITH YOU:

While preparing for a Halloween costume contest, the girls are sent back in time to the Middle Ages.  How will they ever return?

A SPY IS BORN -- PART TWO

The conclusion to the cliffhanger from Volume 1, this excellently written episode gives us a little  better insight into how the girls became as they are.",1104019200,6,945,4.301136363636363
