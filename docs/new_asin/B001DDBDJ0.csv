8292826,2,B001DDBDJ0,"The idea of presenting the life of a Beijing taxi driver has great potential for some really interesting stories.

Instead the movie jumped around so much that those connections never evolved in a way that made sense. The acting was surprisingly good in spite of the struggling story.",1238630400,,412,5.164179104477612
