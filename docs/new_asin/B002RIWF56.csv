8378750,4,B002RIWF56,"Tells the history of the US Navy SEALs from WW 2 up to 1999 or 2000.  Aired on the History Channel back when it was an actual history channel.  Has stories from its beginnings in WW2, the Vietnam War era which was interesting and how the viet cong and NVA feared the ""men with green faces"".  SEALS took the battle to them and turned their own game around on them.  Also mentions SEAL Team 6 and Red Cell.  Also talks about BUD/S and Hell Week.  After they finish BUD/S its still nt over for these guys. And Even more training to do before they even get to wear the SEAL Trident and get assigned to their teams.  Over all pretty good story of the baddest MO-FOs around the battlefield.",1354492800,,684,4.255813953488372
