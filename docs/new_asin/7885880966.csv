1137196,1,7885880966,"Wonderful picture quality, act, interpretation, directing... but awful sound quality in MONO!!! I was expecting more from this DVD.",1042329600,6,131,5.947368421052632
1137197,5,7885880966,"Those who owned the first muddied, dark and blurry VHS print of this on VAI will be shocked but pleased (as I certainly was) to discover that this pristine copy on Deutsche Grammophon DVD is almost a different film. The VHS release had one thinking that the concept was of the opera as being set perpetually at night; here on the DVD we see day and night scenes. Plus, colors are vivid, faces are clear, and all looks clean and fresh.

The performance is a mixed bag though. Furtwngler is possibly the wrongest conductor of Mozart as can be, as evidenced by his dirge-like tempi, sludgy textures and Mahlerian heaviness. The value in this film comes in seeing the performers captured - rarely, as it turns out - as they were in their heyday, and pretty close to their prime. In some aspects there is only historical value, as in the case of the Donna Elvira, Lisa Della Casa, who is otherwise photogenic and voluptuous. Tonally though, she is white sounding and ""tubular"" in vocal production, which after a fashion creates a sense of monotony, despite her committed performance. Then there's Erna Berger, perennially touted in this role as being vocally well-preserved and fresh of voice. I hear a nasality and spinsterish tone, and as far as the performance goes, the results here are of a matronly, sexless Zerlina, where the attempt at girlishness is arch, coy and downright embarrassing. Otto Edelmann's very German, very broadly played Leporello doesn't match Siepi's very Italian, very subtle Giovanni.
Much better is the young Walter Berry as Masetto, masculine and firm in tone; and Anton Dermota as Ottavio, not ideally fluent but sweet in voice and certainly one of the best tenors in the role to be had at the time.
Elisabeth Grmmer is a spontaneous, emotionally appealing Donna Anna. Grmmer had the ability to project a very feminine sincerity, and her singing and acting always had a from-the-heart manner which made her an outstanding artist and personality.  Her singing is admirably precise, the tone steady and which peals forth with shining clarity, with its unique timbral ""tear"".
That leaves Siepi, perhaps the most memorable and natural Don Giovanni of the last 50 years.  He has everything for the role: elegant dash, rakish charm, dark, romantic matinee-idol looks, athletic physique, a careless savoir-faire, and not least, a golden, suavely beautiful tone.  Siepi has a way of moulding a line which can depict an ardent kind of romanticism and elegance that befits the character; he sees Giovanni as a hedonistic charmer who has a fatal lack of concern for the feelings of others. Of course, when his irresponsible behavior finally catches up with him and Hell beckons, Siepi has no trouble whatsoever in conveying Giovanni's fright as he's being dragged down to the subterranean depths of Devil Land. Siepi is frighteningly intense here, and really does sound like a man scared out of his wits. It's a eerie, effective sequence.
How fortunate that Siepi was caught in a role which he practically owned during his career, and which was a hard act to follow - which this release certainly proves.",1035676800,20,3120,4.925855513307985
1137198,5,7885880966,"Opera performance involves many people. It is an extremely rare event when each of these people is in the right place at the right time. Furtwaengler's ""Don Giovanni"", recorded in Salzburg, offers more than that: the lost art of making real music without being vulgar or pedantic, the triumph of taste and experience over modernist pseudointellectuals, the ease of accomplished virtuosity, the impeccable quality of singing, compared to which any Metropolitan opera performance recorded during the last 30 years sounds like an amateurs' rehearsal, compared to which Parteigenosse von Karajan simply fades out of memory like the bloodless, lifeless ghost, inflated to the extent of invisibility. I am not afraid to use the strongest expressions: this is, probably, the best opera performance ever recorded, and it shall stand forever as one of the highest human achievements, putting to shame and tormenting every envious follower of the ephemeral fads and perversions. I am very glad that this recording has been issued on DVD, which substantially improves the quality of sound and image. This DVD is also reasonably priced. Previously, I've cherished a very expensive ($80) and rare VHS tape, somewhat blurry in both sound and image. Now I am given a bliss of seeing it again in sharp and bright colors on wide screen, as if I've been sitting right there, in the orchestra pit, beside good old scary Furtwaengler, breathing the fresh evening air of that miraculous night in Salzburg, watching Don Giovanni, that archetype of modern irresponsibility, being consumed by the flames of confusion and pain he caused to others. Curiously enough, when I was very young, Don Giovanni seemed to me a hero rejecting prejudice and irrationality; the older I became, the uglier stood this freak who flouts prejudice only because he is full of it, because he has challenged the mediocrity not from above but from below. Self-destruction never comes uninvited: ""M'invitasti, e son venuto.""",1025308800,29,1976,5.216981132075472
1137199,5,7885880966,"There are others who went in great detail regarding this performance.  I will only add that this is the best Don Giovanni performance I've ever seen or heard.  Siepi is absolutely the most superb and sexiest Don ever and this is why he is so believable.  The acting of others is great too, and this is all on top of extraordinary singing.  Although I like the La Scala production with Thomas Allen, and other Dons were OK - like Raimondi and Ramey, this is an absolutely outstanding performance from all standpoints - singing, conducting, acting, costumes and everything else.  A true work of art and a must-see for opera fans.",1023148800,15,627,4.663636363636364
1137200,2,7885880966,"I didn't like this performance other than Siepi who was OK.  Lisa Della Casa is one of the most irritating sopranos I've ever heard other than Mari Zampari who is at the top of my list of singers to avoid.  The acting was corny because of the dated performance (1954), sound quality was certainly not up to my standards of acceptance.  This is a Don I'll gladly give away to someone who can appreciate it because I couldn't.  I don't recommend unless someone wants to collect a historical performance of Don Giovanni on DVD.  The other four available are far superior.",1020384000,5,568,4.584158415841584
1137201,5,7885880966,"The DVD of Furtwangler's 1954 Salzburg Festival production of Mozart's Don Giovanni is a document of an extraordinary performance, the only filmed version of an opera conducted by the legendary maestro, Wilhelm Furtwangler. The production is wonderfully conducted, beautifully sung by an all-star cast of the era, photographed in excellent color and recorded in very good monophonic sound.  Especially outstanding among the cast is Cesare Siepi as the Don, perhaps the most lauded Don of the 20th century.  His renditions of the Champagne Aria and the Serenade are masterful.  And Lisa Della Casa's Donna Elvira is extremely moving and well-sung.  The rest of the cast also is very good. The production by Herbert Graf is a bit clunky and dated in places although the sets and costumes are very lavish. The banquet scene at the end of Act II is very dramatically staged. For Furtwangler fans, the shots of F conducting the overture are especially rewarding. Overall, a treat not to be missed by opera lovers and those devoted to Furtwangler's extraordinary conducting.",1011398400,30,1068,5.15606936416185
1137202,3,7885880966,"The acting is the strong point of this version of Don Giovanni. The real trouble is that though the singing seems quite well done, particularly the male roles, the sound quality is really poor.  It is probably worth watching just to see the excellient way Siepi plays the Don, but the soprano voices particularly suffer from the acoustics and/or the recording.  The orchestra is often recorded too far forward which also obscures the vocals.  Really, your purchase of this video will depend more on whether the historical interest is enough to offset the very real deficiencies in the sound.",1008115200,14,591,4.94949494949495
1137203,5,7885880966,"I had never before seen the Furtwngler Don Giovanni, but I knew that it was considered by many to be one of the greatest productions of this much loved opera. This production was filmed shortly after its wildly successful run in Salzburg, Austria in 1953. It has lost none of its appeal nearly a half century later. This is the most rivetting account I have ever seen, live or on video, of Mozart's ""dramma giocoso"", which in this production definitely tilts towards the ""dramma"" aspect. The singing is fabulous from all members of this stellar cast assembled in the early 1950s. The Wiener Philharmoniker plays with a real feeling for this opera under Furtwngler. Indeed, this is a highly atmospheric production on all levels. Cesare Siepe is regarded as one of the all-time great Giovannis, and you will see and most importantly hear why in his highly dramatic portrayal of the lascivious don. Siepe not only sings the part flawlessly, but he can truly act, too. The final act will have you on the edge of your seat, to be sure. After brazenly lunging at the statue of the Commendatore with a knife, he recoils in terror when his action has no effect. After a brief moment of fear, he regains his composure and defiance.  The emotions of Giovanni are conveyed by Sierpe in the most subtle of ways, a gesture here, a facial expression there, and of course via his singing. I'm sure everyone reading this knows the rest of the story, but you may be surprised at how brilliantly Siepe brings it all about, with his actions as much as his singing. I found myself feeling much more sympathetic towards the doomed Giovanni in this production than I have in most others, and that is entirely due to Siepe's brilliant portrayal. The rest of the cast is equally or very nearly as strong as its lead character. I watched this performance in utter amazement from start to finish, and cannot recommend it highly enough.  It is in color, although the colors are on the pale side (not a problem!) and the sound format is in a high-quality mono (please don't let that steer you away from this masterpiece!).  The sets are very realistic, and unlike many other operas on DVD, the picture is clear and the color excellent even in the night scenes (of which there are many in this opera). Included is a very informative booklet that gives background of this production as well as a summary of the opera. The picture format is 4:3, so it will fill your entire screen, and the playing time is 177 minutes. Subtitles are in English, Italian, Spanish, French German and Chinese. This is an opera DVD not to be missed, as it captures a historic performance that is nothing short of stunning.  I would definitely rank this Don Giovanni in the top 5 best operas on DVD that I have seen.",1006646400,197,2763,4.609756097560975
1137204,5,7885880966,"I have to sacrifice doby 5.1 and 16x9 screen to see this historical video.  Siepi was my first Don and finally I can see him life anytime in my living room.

But he is nicely matched by the great oversized heldenbasso Otto Edelmann, whose big voice and good-humored personal charisma contribute as much to this performance as Siepi does.  Like Siepi, Edelmann is really in his role (Leporello), acting the hell out of it with his whole body and face.",1411516800,,346,4.75
1137409,5,7885880966,"This performance is memorable for several reasons.  First and foremost is the quality of the singers and the orchestra.  Cesare Siepi defines the role of the Don, and all the women, Elisabeth Grummer, Lisa della Casa, and Erna Berger, are sensational.  Then, of course is the Leoporello of a young Otto Edelmann, the Ottavio of Anton Dermata, and a very young Walter Berry singing Masetto, all of them masterful.  Furtwangler's exciting and nuanced conducting is a major asset.  On a different note, it is fascinating to see how operatic acting differs today from its traditions 50 years ago.  Highly emotive, hand and arm gestures that one never sees any more..very stylized and outdated, but it is interesting and sometimes very amusing to see how it was done.  The Catalog aria is priceless in that regard.  Staged at the old riding school at Salzburg, the settings and conduct, particularly of the final scene are wonderful.  The ONLY disappointment to for me was the complete omission of Don Ottavio's aria, ""Dalla Sua Pace.""",1411171200,3,1030,4.976608187134503

But Furtwaengler is one of the great conductors and the recording is well worth it for the performance of Cesare Siepi, surely the greatest Don Giovanni ever. I consider myself fortunate to have seen him do it live over 40 years ago and this is a fine souvenir.",1409529600,2,371,4.391304347826087

1137412,5,7885880966,"I must agree with all de ""plaudits"" devoted to this historical and really wonderful version of D.G., BUT i would counsel to all its admirers to have a try of 1956 version conducted in the same place by Dimitri Mitropoulos (Sony, only CD, no video). When ""Furt"" died, ""Mit"" took his baton in Salzbourg.
Mit's D.G. is quite different from the one of his predecessor, but certainely not worse. As impressive a Furt's in the grat dramatic moments, he is more flexible in the rest of the opera in a way that reminds me of Bruno Walters unforgettable ""Met""s version with Pinza, Bampton, Sayao, etc. The cast is more or less the same: Siepi, Grmmer, della Casa, Berry, but with some improvements: Frick as Comendatore and Corena' extremely idiomatic Leporello. Simoneau is an astonishingly suave Ottavio (and he sings the two arias) and Rita Streich a charming Zerlina. And I do not miss old-fashined ""Inszeniering"" by Graf.  Once again, HAVE A TRY.

Elisabeth Grummer was a trained/educated Theatre actress that became an Opera sensation while Maria Callas' acting was a part of her natural persona and character....

Unfortunately there is not much of Elisabeth Grummer's work being appreciated nowadays and this particular Video will go down in history as an amazing work of Art from all perspectives with no equal after over six decades.

This is the work of the Music Titan, Wilhelm Furtwangler, whom Maria Callas called: ""The reincarnation of Beethoven"".",1391731200,,731,5.451327433628318

1137525,5,7885880966,"If it were not for the 1953 Salzburg performance, this would reign as the supreme Don Giovanni. Furtwaengler knows how to balance gravity and lightness perfectly, so the result is a reading that is both mercurial when it needs be, but never losing the frightening and tragic undertone of the Don's final demise at the hands of his late victim, the Commendatore. Where the 1953 scores is (a) Elizabeth Schwarzkopf's Elvira, FAR more intense than the frankly disappointing Della Casa, Rafaele Arie's towering Commendatore, a COMPLETE Oveture (no one seems to notice that the recapitulation is cut in the video) and the aria Dalla sus Pace, also missing from the video. A superb SACD hybrid of the 1953 is put out by the Societe Wilhelm Furtwaengler (the French Furtwaengler Society, only available to members). Otherwise, Siepi remains the definitive Don, Edelmann is terrific as Leporello, Gruemmer, Dermota, Berger and Berry are better in their respective roles than anyone else. As for Furtwaengler, well, I feel that he outclasses everyone else in this work; and although I acknowledge his greatness in Wagnerian Operas, his Don Giovanni, like his Fidelio, remains his supreme achievement in opera. For all the freedom he employs in his music making, his architectural firmness makes me wonder if he is more classicist than romanticist. Can any musician compare to him?",1370131200,3,1371,5.1524663677130045
1137526,5,7885880966,"This is just a brief shout out to the reviewers who praised this DVD of Furtwangler conducting this Golden Age performance. I love Furtwangler but have trouble with the sonics of most of his recordings. So I assumed this would also be a tinny sounding DVD. Boy was I wrong. The sound is great, the picture clear, the singers are great, the acting is natural and effective, the sets impressive. Furtwangler starts out a bit slowly in the overture but then leads the orchestra in an unforgettable performance. One of my most treasured opera DVDs!",1366761600,5,544,4.7368421052631575
1137527,4,7885880966,"three of them were recorded or filmed between 1954 and 1956: Furtwangler, Krips, and Mitropoulos (see my reviews). Siepi and Della Casa sing in all three; Dermota is Ottavio  with Krips and
Furtwangler while Simoneau sings with DM; Corena sings Leporello with Krips and DM; Streich is Zerlina with DM and Gueden with Krips; Grummer also sings with  DM while Suzanne Danco sings Donna
Anna for Krips; for DM Frick is the Commendatore while Kurt Bohme sings the role with  Krips; Walter Berry is Masetto for all three.
The Mitropoulos is also a live performance.  While sound is not a major problem for the three, I would rank them as follows: Krips, Mitropoulos, and Furtwangler.  Furtwangler sometimes conducts too slowly, which I find problematic . However, he atones at least partly in two ways.  Some scenes/ensembles which begin slowly catch fire progressively, eg the Act I conclusion and Cemetery sextet.
Secondly, within these variable tempi, the entire cast sings with maximum intensity whatever emotion(s) is being dramatized.  To see the singers in the cemetery sextet (minus Siepi and Dezso Ernster) is a pantheonic event- all of them at their peaks or on their way except Erna Berger whose voice remained astonishingly pure and beautiful until her sixties. Siepi and Edelman were a great team//Siepi and Corena ( a bit more elegant as Leporello but just as comic). Edelman cowering on the ground in the cemetery reminded me of a guilty Cartman in South Park.
Re the other two Vienna recordings: Mitropoulos  employs quicker tempi -he is a bit more dramatic than Krips , e.g in the final two scenes. Two singers for DM only are at least equal
to their peers in the other versions: Rita Streich and Leopold Simoneau (not a better singer than Dermota but the owner of a more beautiful voice, I think).  Krips' cast is equally good with
the possible exception of Suzanne Danco as Donna Anna.  She is excellent vocally and dramatically but I prefer Grummer's voice. I consider the Krips and Mitropoulos indispensible but would not
want to be without the Furtwangler version.",1362528000,3,2081,4.936962750716332
1137528,4,7885880966,"This is a thoroughly 1954 production, prepared for 1954 sensibilities.  It is as prudish as Don Giovanni can be.  The singers look like 1954 men and women, not like 21st century fashion models.  They sing well.  This was an age when opera singers were expected to sing great, not look great.  The sets, props, and costumes have that fabulous grand opera feel so few modern productions are willing to pay for.  Visually, I find this DVD quite acceptable.

Yes, the sound does have some minor issues.  This is hardly surprising given the year it was made.  That, and the too slow overture, are what gives this DVD four stars instead of five.  Apart from the overture, the tempi are fine.

Cesare Siepi is nearly perfect as the Don, vocally and as an actor.  His commendatore scene is particularly awesome.  He probably sustained a half dozen bruises falling down on the stage -- all while singing perfectly!  I give him ten out of ten for that scene and I doubt I will ever see it sung and acted better.

Not only does it have the best singers possible of that area but the production is simple and delightful - no Regietheater, nothing gimmicky - just the greatest ""Don Giovanni"" in every respect.
As some who have read my reviews will have noticed, I am not a great one to go into detailed critiques of individual singers. To me, a singer either has got it or hasn't. Well, they all have it. Siepi is in the greatest form and sexy as all get out and Dermota no wimp he. It's just sheer perfection coming together and one simply gets totally engrossed in the music, the drama - in brief, in the opera.
And just by the way and the tempi with which Furtwaengler supports all these superstars, you realize that he deservedly was reputed to be one of the greatest conductors of his area.",1349481600,4,960,4.194594594594594
1137530,5,7885880966,"The ""Don Giovanni"" produced for the 1953 Salzburg Festival was an immense success. Thus, the producer Paul Czinner persuaded the Festival Direction, the cast and Furtwngler to take part to a movie production for television broadcasting (using the same stage and scenography: here we do not have an operatic movie, but a movie reproducing a virtual, not live, theatre performance), that started at the end of 1954 theatre season, a few months before Furtwngler's death.
This DVD brings back to us that invaluable document, previously issued on videotape.

Here we can actually get in touch with the achievement, at its best, of the idea of ""recitar cantando"".
All the stars involved in this wonderful performance act perfectly and accordingly sing. Obviously they all are top singers, so that the ""mistery"" of the incredible and persistent success of the basic and general concept of ""melodramma"" (in all its forms) is clearly and simply unveiled.
Acting while singing, in a environment moulded by music, is a more complete form of art than only acting or only singing. Paraphrasing Eugenio Montale, opera is the artistic form that more than any other aims at ""the sublime"", facing, impavid, the ridiculous. If music and lyrics are good enough, what allows to avoid the ridiculous and to achieve the sublime is involving acting along with masterful singing.
Therefore, here we do not meet tenors with senseless prominent thumbs or sopranos with menacing forefingers or salty statues moving their mouths. Here we see living characters, whose natural and best way of expressing their ideas, feelings, moods is singing. And what acting and singing cannot express is completed by the musical context.
Set design (scenography) is directly involved in the result. Characters have to move in an environment (not necessarily realistic) that allows their action to have a sense. The scenography (by Clemens Holzmeister) of this ""Don Giovanni"" is only apparently traditional; indeed, it is out of time and it hides its perfect blueprint in integrating what characters are acting and singing, discreetly providing them with support points when needed or perfect (that is, consistent with action, text and music timing) distance among objects when moving.
In the particular case, the stage had been set in the Felsenreitschule (old riding school) ""in that supernatural dcor which seems to have emerged by history - the stone archways (highly appropriate for Don Giovanni!) were hewn out of the sheer rock of the Monchberg in 1662"" (J.P. Brechenmacher, Booklet accompanying CDs of Rodolphe Productions edition, 1988).
In this ideal environment, a superb direction (by Herbert Graf - stage - and Paul Czinner & Alfred Travers - movie and television -) completes the work, moving and affecting characters with an incredible and meaningful naturalness.
In some cases, gestures are of astonishing beauty, as while accompanying Don Ottavio's ""lo giuro"" to Donna Anna.

Cesare Siepi (1923-2010), as usual, sings exceptionally well and, with rare mastery, tackles the problem of acting a Don Giovanni very agile and, at once, lordly; generally, quick moving is not  associated with a lordly posture, but, here, agility is necessary to give the sense of Don Giovanni's ""hunting"" instinct and pulse, decision, mental rapidity and flexibility, restlessness and intolerance for other people.
In his final scene, Siepi is simply astonishing in rendering Don Giovanni's actual anguish and consternation and, at the same time, his proud reaction to them trying to take the situation under control until the last painful breath: the gamble has to be backed till the end of the game, not to debase and destroy everything he had been before. Worth seeing!

Donna Elvira, in this proper interpretation, still and deeply loves Don Giovanni, and, in spite of appearance, she is not looking for revenge, but she hopes someway to manage to save him.
Obviously she is a warm and sensual woman and she desires him back to her - also recovering her ""honour"": why not? -, but this is not the heart of the matter.
She is sincerely worried about his destiny and, figuratively, she may be regarded as the incarnation of an angel envied to offer him the last opportunity of redemption (not by chance, she appears after Don Giovanni's worst misdeed), but, at the same time, to prove that Don Giovanni has been allowed to make use of his free will. When, at dinner, he sarcastically rejects her, evidence is reached and, consequently, the Stone Guest appears for the final judgement.
A gorgeous Lisa Della Casa (b. 1919) was enrolled to play this difficult and troubled role, substituting Elizabeth Schwarzkopf (1915-2006), who, not convinced of the movie project, refused the part. Someway, this can be considered a good luck, in the sense that, in any case, we have the wonderful Schwarzkopf in Salzburg 1953 on CD, while Della Casa's figure, in my opinion, better suites to the Donna Elvira of our imagination.

Donna Anna here dresses again her true noble personality. In too many recent versions she is depicted as a sort of cleaned out tramp, who actually and sexually desires Don Giovanni (or somebody else more sensual, fascinating or handsome of Don Ottavio), while pretending to love her suitor.
We do not have any elements to induce that Donna Anna feels attraction for Don Giovanni, but, in any case, this could be absolutely natural. Virtue does not consist in not feeling sensuality (that would be frigidity), but in dominating it aiming at higher values, a worthy motherhood for instance.
Neither the fact that not immediately she tells Ottavio what actually happened in that tragic night proves some false attitude, nor the fact that she defers the marriage can be ironically interpreted. Her beloved father has just been suddenly killed while defending her! Besides, she does betray Don Giovanni as her aggressor.
Elisabeth Grmmer (1911-1986) sings and plays this role astonishingly well. From an acting point of view, in my opinion, she is the most gifted and naturally posed of the cast.

Anton Dermota (1910-1989) sings and plays very well what is wrongly considered the most thankless role of the drama (Don Ottavio). In my opinion, he is better in singing, with a flawless, smooth and well balanced vocal emission, but it is also true that he has to act mainly facing (and being compared with) Grmmer's superb expressiveness.
In any case, Don Ottavio here is not erroneously depicted as cowardly and shallow, but as a future tender husband, good father and exemplar citizen.

What is wrong with this tender young couple? Why so many interpretations tends to deny their virtues? Why so often all spotlights are pointed on the fascinating Don Giovanni (or on his myth)?
Pay attention, there is a subtle pitfall! The expression ""Dramma giocoso"" here is used with the same intention Dante used the term ""Commedia"". ""Dramma giocoso"" is well suited to ""Le Nozze di Figaro"" or ""Cos Fan Tutte"", where nothing of irreparable happens; on the contrary, in ""Don Giovanni"" supernatural forces are directly involved in the plot, two men tragically die, one of them is damned for eternity, Elvira renounces the world and goes to a definitive retreat.
Mozart loves sincerely this couple as much sincerely he thinks that Ottavio e Anna are a model of good feelings and virtues, of reciprocal respect, joined to tenderness, of use of shared laws against individual abuse and arrogance.
This is the same Mozart of Tamino and Pamina (the metaphysical perfect couple) and of ""La Clemenza di Tito"".
Mozart and Da Ponte make Don Giovanni fascinating, because evil is (apparently) fascinating. They depict Anna and Ottavio a bit ""boring"", because virtue is (apparently) a bit boring. They also propose a second class choice, less ""boring"" but less noble, Masetto and Zerlina (or Papageno and Papagena).
But, to the apparent leading role, Don Giovanni, they do not give a single real aria ... because he has nothing to express! He is completely empty.
On the contrary, Anna and Ottavio are given magnificent and noble arias and duets!

Erna Berger, born in 1900 (d. 1990), in 1954 is a really too aged Zerlina for the stage, but her vocal timbre is still youthful and fresh. Besides, she is slightly build and her acting and singing are lively and vivacious, therefore reducing the problem.
In conclusion, her experience and supreme artistry avoid affecting too much in video what would be considered a top level performance on an audio recording.

We are overwhelmed by socio-historical interpretations concerning ""Le Nozze di Figaro"".
In ""Don Giovanni"", Masetto goes far beyond Figaro's ""Se vuol ballare ..."" (or Cherubino's unaware insubordination); Masetto wants to teach a lesson to a nobleman directly threatening him (is he ready to kill him?).
But Figaro is a servant (or a factotum), while Masetto (if not a bourgeois) is not the last fellow of the village and he has an established social position (people is ready to follow him; he will marry ""the beauty"" of the village).
Masetto's behaviour is not completely credible in Don Giovanni's times, but in Mozart-Da Ponte's times (1787)... .
A young Walter Berry (1929-2000) is perfect suited to the role and he well expresses, vocally and acting, pride, spontaneity and self-confidence. Masetto and Zerlina are not ""romantic"" lovers: pleasure is important for both of them, but honour intended as reputation and standing (in Masetto) and social climbing (in Zerlina) are more important than love.
Differently from Ottavio and Anna, Masetto and Zerlina are at risk. Masetto is rightly fooled and punished when attempting to use evil means against evil; Zerlina is saved by Elvira, not by herself, when evil tempts her in her Ego's weaknesses (in that context, without Elvira intervention, her destiny would have been of dishonour, social rejecting and unworthiness for marriage and motherhood).
The Berry-Berger's couple renders perfectly this kind of conventional and ""terrestrial"" relationship.

Otto Edelmann (1917-2003), with his rubber mask, is an exceptionally expressive and vivid Leporello.
He perfectly renders the mercenary character of the cynical servant and his ambiguity. Leporello's instability between his bad acting and his consciousness of ethical limits (""Ma Donn'Anna cosa ha voluto?"") derives from his laziness and indolence, but he justifies them as a proper reaction to what he considers the inequity of his destiny (in what his master is better than him to deserve his privileges?) and not as the actual cause of his status.
Therefore, Leporello remains isolated on the border of the social fabric (we do not know if he is actually married or not).
Edelmann acts and sings very well, with the sole problem of an imperfect Italian pronunciation, or, better, the presence in it of typical German inflections.

Dezs Ernster (1898-1981), in 1954, already boasted a long and prestigious international career. In my opinion, here he and his voice look a bit tired. Singing is not profound and frightful enough to make you tremble or to give you, by itself, gooseflesh (in 1953 live version on CD, the ""Commendatore"" was a more threatening Raffaele Ari).
The problem seems to consists in a slight lack of breath to hold music slow pace.
It is a pity, because everything else in the most characterizing scenes of this opera is perfect and involving.

But it is obvious that the main star here is Wilhelm Furtwngler (perfectly supported by Wiener Philharmoniker and Vienna State Opera Chorus).
The first shots of the movie show him conducting the overture.
As soon as he takes place on the podium, you perceive that something unforgettable is going to happen. You feel that a sort of sacred rite is starting and you have the luck to have gained the entrance to it.
Furtwngler's general conception of music and conducting is clearly and quite completely expressed in his book ""Concerning Music""; for people who agree with him, like I do, there is nothing to add here, if not the observation that this perforamance shows us the full and mature achievement of what abstractly discussed in the book.
The most evident peculiarity of his interpretation of ""Don Giovanni"" is the calm pacing of his conducting. But relatively moderato tempos do not mean neither improper slowness, nor lack of tension. On the contrary, tension here is constantly at its zenith. Your attention is always completely absorbed.
A relatively slower pace is what is needed to music, words and gestures to articulate in depth and in detail the complexity of (contrasting) moods and to allow you to become aware of what is actually and dynamically happening in characters' psyches and souls.
Exposition and understanding have to contemporarily occur ""hic et nunc""; on the contrary, the celebration of the rite is meaningless and what is a life giving performance would become a mere narration.
Mismatched pre-conceived Freudian interpretations are out of place here. Neither every man secretly desire to be like Don Giovanni, nor every woman fall in love with him.
Furtwngler's attentive work manages to embroider, in front of your very eyes, a neat and coherent arras, avoiding to sew up unjustified preconceptions in an incongruent patchwork. Therefore, everything is collocated in its own right place.
Here orchestra and singers breath together, and their common breathing is the same one naturally flowing out from score and lyrics.

Movie technicalities are obviously aged. Picture format is 4:3, colours are not particularly brilliant and sound is mono. There is some little problems of synchronization between voices and mouth movements. Sometimes cameras have problems with the depth of focus.
In my opinion, nothing of all that is able to affect a full enjoyment of such a masterful interpretation.
On the other side, we have to consider that, from a technical point of view, this movie, at that time, being not shot using a cinematographic set, was regarded as a great and successful achievement.

J.P. Brechenmacher (above mentioned) pointed out that the 1953 edition was better than 1954 one, the latter being possibly affected by a sort of tiredness and drop of tension. I have no element to discuss the matter. The July 27, 1953, public performance is issued on CD and it is a live recording, while here we have a movie reproducing a particular kind of studio performance.
Conductor, orchestra, chorus and singers had to move in a strange context, working hard, often by night, for many hours; maybe some moment of tiredness here and there actually occurred, as, maybe, in the case of Ernster.

Anyway, an unsurpassed masterpiece (five stars plus) had been achieved and this edition places it again within everybody's reach.",1339027200,11,14728,5.118087318087318
1137531,4,7885880966,"Despite its age (Salzburg Festival, 1954), this is a chance to see the great Cesare Siepi totally mastering this difficult role.  Superb of voice and lithe of movement, this is the Don that no woman could easily resist, even if she regrets it later! Siepi's interpretation is very different to that of Raimondi's rather demonic Don or (more recently) Terfel's thuggish Don.  His performance of the ""champagne aria"" has never, in my opinion, been bettered. He is well-matched by superlative singing from the rest of the cast - the two ""Donnas"", Grummer and Della Casa, are sublime. Erna Berger makes a rather mature Zerlina but is appropriately pert and cheeky. It was a surprise to see (and hear) Otto Edelmann as Leporello and as he clumps and grimaces his way around the stage you can see the makings of the fine Baron Ochs that he is soon to play in Rosenkavalier.  This isn't a criticism - he is a very fine Leporello too.  Anton Dermota (of whom I'd never heard before)is quite a virile Don Ottavio in this unrewarding role. I'm no expert on conducting but Furtwangler has a nice old-school approach and the orchestra is as good as you'd expect the Vienna Phil to be, even in those austere post-war years.  True, the colours seem a bit faded (though I felt this gave the production an appealing ambience - the Don as metaphor for the crumbling, stumbling shambles that once-powerful and glorious Spain was soon to become).  The sound track, too, is a bit rough here and there, but never in my opinion affects one's enjoyment of a production that must be regarded as a classic.  I'm so pleased to have it in my opera collection!",1322611200,3,1632,4.665505226480836

What a great surprise! I have been disapointed in the past for not finding much videos on the web showing Furtwangler conducting, not to mention any with this quality of sound! Maybe the greatest conductor of all times, at least from those we can be affortunate enough to have recordings!

I found this cast very good .I have been very lucky in the selections that I have made of this difficult opera because it required very good singers /actors and frequent scenery
changes.
Even though the production is from 1954 the quality of the film is pretty good as well as the sound.
I read in some reviews that the applause from the public was deleted when the DVD was made, I really like to hear when I see a live performance because I can have an idea about the reaction of the audience that is watching the show,but it is not a reason to don't give 5 stars to the DVD, for me the must important things in the quality of the production are the singers/actors, the direction, the sound of the music and all these aspects were great.

1137534,5,7885880966,"In response to Herr Spielmann (nice Mahlerian allusion):

If one compares it to Furtwangler's RAI Ring, one sees a tremendous difference between a ""studio version"" (such as the Ring) and a true enactment of the opera, as is seen in this performance.  You get a far greater dramatic involvement on the part of the singers here - particularly by Siepi and Edelmann - than one hears in Patzak's Mime in the Ring (for example).  In fact, it was not apparent to me that this WASN'T in front of an audience.

Siepi's Don has to be the most moving and multifacted approach to the Don that I have heard.  His acting is incredible, his voice unbelievably beautiful, and his presence imposing.  For me, it will be a long time - if ever - before I can think of the Don without thinking of him.  He is able to use small gestures, facial expressions,  body language, and tonal inflection to communicate more than I have ever seen before in this role.  In particular, unlike many one-dimensional, macho Don's that I have seen, he vividly projects a powerful mixture of terror, defiance, and being overwhelmed in the final scene with the Commendatore.  One feels almost sorry for him when he is dragged down to hell.  Edelmann, who I have only known through Wagner roles, is perfect for Leporello.  He conveys Leporello's humanity and humor to a T.  Walter Berry, caught very early in his career, showed the comedic genius - to say nothing of the vocal presence - that he brought to so many roles later in his career.  While Anton Dermota is some what dry and a bit more ""spinto"" than I like (let's face it, I've been spoiled by Fritz Wunderlich's excerpts!), he does a splendid job as Don Ottavio.  The women are equally wonderful!  Elizabeth Grummer brings a Wagnerian (although not Valkyrie) strength to the role of Donna Anna that is far more appropriate that Bohm's Birgit Nilsson.  She truly conveys that powerful sense of anger and rage - as well as the internal ambivalence - that Donna Anna feels towards the Don.  Lisa Della Casa sings Donna Elvira with a wonderful sensitivity and beauty and Erna Berger is perfect as the young and naive Zerlina.

While all of this is quite true, it doesn't address the true star of this show: Wilhelm Furtwangler.  This is a Mozart that is so dramatically alive, so beautifully played, that contains such rich orchestral detail and sense of musical line throughout the the opera that it truly sets the gold standard for performances of this opera.

I have to say that the fact that one doesn't have applause or curtain calls not only seems like an extremely minor cavil and the lack thereof helps to maintain dramatic continuity by avoiding breaking the dramatic continuity of the performance of (the well deserved) ""bravos"" that would have brought the performance to a halt.

For me, this DVD IS Don Giovanni with the finest possible cast and the greatest possible conductor AND it is staged!!  Who could ask for anything more!!!!",1284422400,10,2962,4.70873786407767

The acting is on the high school level, the staging is terrible, and the camera work is of the silent era.  Moreover, the costuming does little to flatter the often hefty and physically unattractive singers. (Leporello looks like an insurance salesman; Zerlina....well, let's be kind and say nothing.)

1137659,5,7885880966,"I had a previous review here in which I blasted Ernster and Dermota for their weak voices and Della Casa for her tepid performance, as well as expressing my dislike of the final sextet which for me ruins the drama of the opera.

So what changed? Well I watched it again on a small screen rather than trying to get mono sound out of a 6 speaker home theater system. This doesn't change the fact that Della Casa is a ""run of the mill Elvira"" as I said. Nor does it make me like the silly sextet, but it does equalize the voices somewhat. This gives new life and drama to the important parts of Don Ottavio and the Commendatore played by Anton Dermota and Deszo Ernster. The dress rehearsal type atmosphere(no audience) and 50's costumes and sets cease to be noticable after awhile.

Not much need be said about Cesare Siepi who I believe more and more is the greatest Don ever. Same for  Elisabeth Grummer, who again in my opinion was the best Donna Anna ever. Edelmann is a treat as Leporello despite a bad hair stylist. Erna Berger as Zerlina is easy on the ears if not the eyes and Walter Berry is still my favorite Masetto.

Furtwangler has to do little more than be there with a cast like this. Where his genius shows is that he keeps the music moving and doesn't try to make the opera his own when it belongs to Mozart, a mistake too many conductors make.

Taken with all the singers on equal terms this may just be the best Don Giovanni on DVD.",1220745600,9,1449,4.293040293040293
1137660,5,7885880966,"This is an optimal way of showcasing a grand opera in a traditional production. Musically immensely satisfying, I think it beats the Salzburg Karajan version. My older friends who have seen Siepi perform this role live still rave about it, and rightfully so. Also absolutely stellar is Dermota's conception of Ottavio, voice and acting. There is no flaw in the cast. It is a ""show"" that once you turn on the set you want see as much of it as you can, maybe do it in one sitting.",1210550400,6,478,4.443181818181818
1137661,5,7885880966,"It is many years since I first saw this as a film in a theatre and my memories of it were such that I was almost scared to play it again on DVD lest it not live up to the memory. I needn't have worried - the intervening years and seeing several wonderful live productions have taken none of the lustre off this very special offering.
Almost unashamedly filmed as a live performance on a set that allows the action to move easily through the many scene changes effectively, the camera moves from panoramic into close but never closeup. The result is totally satisfying and one can only wonder why other opera films since have not followed this principle because it delivers a perspective that entirely stands on its own (and minimises anomalies).
In the title role, Cesare Siepi is mesmerising. Recognised as one of the greatest Don's ever, one can easily see why. Vocally completely in charge of the role he moves with such incredible grace it is hard to take one's eyes off him. The gestures and facial expressions seem to capture every nuance, giving ""the supreme cad"" a certain ""charm"" one seldom sees in lesser performances.

Elisabeth Grummer as Donna Anna & Erna Berger as Zerlina are two ladies whose careers were regrettably, negatively impacted by WW2. Both were performers of great distinction and it is a joy to see how competent they really were. Ms Berger was over 50 at the time this was filmed but the sensible camera placing combined with her coquettish (not overdone) approach to the role overcomes the obvious and easily allows the suspension of belief so often necessary in opera.

Lisa Della Casa as Donna Elvira is another performer of yesteryear whose performances have become somewhat legend (and too few recordings). Known for her beauty as much as her voice- it is great to have her permanent record of a Donna Elvira that is more studied and less frantic than many. Walter Berry is a competent Masetto and Anton Dermota as Don Ottavio, delivers a darker richer toned sound that is always totally secure.

Otto Edelmann as Leporello is a delight bringing great character to the role despite some minor pitch problems during his opening aria, ""Notte e Giorno faticar"". Once past that, he doesn't put a foot wrong.

All in all, I believe that this is a production that has a magic all of its own and it deserves a place in any opera lover's collection. Many people say it is one of the top 5 opera DVD's of all time- I can't disagree.",1198540800,11,2457,4.654377880184332

Siepi was a worthy follower in Pinza's footsteps and, having been lucky enough to see him on the stage, I can attest that this voice and acting were as magnificent as they are in the DVD production.  My ONLY regret is that this was not the actual performance, but staged after the fact, as they wanted to have a visual of this great performance and, particularly, of the great Wilhelm Furtwangler's conducting of it, which is indeed splendid.

I consider this a jewel in my Opera collection. It is ""the"" Don Giovanni to buy if you are going to buy the opera for the first time.

Edit: Now that I have recieved the 15th Complete Mozart Edition box that contains Don Giovanni, I can compare the two performances. One is a DVD Video and the other is an Audio CD so I can only compare the musical performance. There is no hesitation when I say that this DVD is just better than the ACDs. As the title implies Siepi is the real jewel of this performance. I stand by what I have told earlier, if you are going to see/hear Don Giovanni for the first time, there should be no hesitation as to which performance you are going to get.

And here's another little thing that I have forgotten to mention befor the edit. The only flaw you can find in this DVD is that sometimes the camera focuses on wrong places. Like, when Siepi is shown close-up the background is in focus not his face. This disturbed me a little but it can't degrade the quality of this DVD in my eyes.

1137664,5,7885880966,"Furtwaengler, Siepi, Della Casa, Otto Edelmann...

they belong to a generation now almost gone.

So what? If an artistic piece is good, it will be good forever.

I don't think this is a moral play.  Cesare Siepi's Don G is never a laughing stock to be mocked at, howsoever he 'disappeared' from stage at the conclusion of the opera.

Siepi's Don is suave, lovable, flirtatious, unruly, at times unscrupulous. some thing of a complex mixture that not many singer/actors are capable in producing: Bryn Terfel, to take a recent example.

Vocally very suave, singing the most magnetic 'Deh vieni all finestra' imaginable, he is nonetheless very deceptive and cunning in his other aria where he lures Masetto to a remote place and beats him up furiously for thwarting his plans on Zerlina and his new target (Elvira's maid).

And the direction is so detailed and convincing - Elvira being veiled so as not to recognise Don G at dawn; Zerlina being a 'little one' in statute as well as in age as so explicity mentioned in the recitative and caricatured in the catalogue aria of Leporello; Ottavio singing in front of Elvira requesting her to sooth Anna after Anna has left the scene, evoking in Elvira a flood of emotions......even Leporello's eating of the 'chicken wing' and being made fun of by his master are all but a few details so often sadly missed in newer productions.

And of course, apart from Siepi, we have a very outstanding Lisa della Casa as Donna Elvira, Elisabeth Gruemmer as Donna Anna, and Anton Dermota as Don Ottavio. Not to mention the immaculate Otto Edelmann's Leporello.

Walter Berry is also very convincing as the simple peasant Masetto.",1170201600,13,1660,4.816901408450704
1137824,4,7885880966,"....and isn't the last finale (after the Don goes to hell) missing in this performance (or was that a bad print I saw once)? If so, how could all of my fellow critics ignore that fact?

This is the 19th-century conception of the Don, as one critic here writes, as a tragic figure. How heroic he is, realizing the bravado won't work, at last. Perhaps Mozart ""was of the devil's party without knowing it,"" to borrow a phrase, and the Don's spectacular death is a tribute to a fine composer writing a great if melodramatic scene.

But if one doesn't see this opera as a comedy, what's the point? However humanely the Don's victims are portrayed, isn't there something ridiculous there, too? The buffa element is even more entrenched than in ""Figaro,"" which I find the more perfect work, if one has to fling that term around. And dear Leporello, after all the trauma, asks only for ""a better master"" at the very end. Like all comedy, everything really does end up as it was at the beginning - the Don has provided a spanner in the works, but no one puts up that big a defense - except a dead man on a horse (now THAT's realistic).

This is a filmed stage production, not a film. The sound is fine for the period; the singing has been well described by others here. The filming of the overture shows the limitations from the beginning - and does Furtwaengler look uncomfortable, or what. It is a bit slow, although the pace is consistent. But was it really necessary to let that moment when the Ottavio looks at the director and shrugs his shoulders before going back into character slide? Argh. (Or is my memory faulty here, perhaps?)

I guess I'm spoiled by a Mozartean like Bergman, who really gave us a FILM of an opera. He is not alone. Peter Sellars has many advocates. And yes, singing aside, there are many flawed elements in most opera films, whether technical or interpretive. Let's be grateful that these singers and this conductor left a record for us.

If you've seen any other productions of the opera (such as that of Mutti with La Scala) you know that some of them can be static and cookie cutterish. -- That isn't to say they're no good, but this production has, at the risk of sounding cliche, something magical to it.

Yes the Commendatore uses a bit too much vibrato and the ""la ci darem la mano"" is sung a bit slower than you're used to hearing (the best rendition of the scene being performed by Raimondi) but the opera is as near perfect as possible

Cesare Siepi's voice is unbelievable throughout and, not to mention, Otto Edelmann's opening scene (""Notte e Giorno Faticar"") is absolutely perfect.  His tone is amazing.",1158451200,28,937,4.689024390243903

His acting is the very definition of taste, chraftsmanship and artistry.

All other singers in this cast are perfectly cast in their roles. The beuty of the singers voices comes very well across due  to the fact that all the singers here have excellent vocal technique. Something that is very often missing in more recent productions. The orchestra is beatiful. And furtwangler's tempi are always right on the money.

There is no applause or curtain calls at the end.

Sound balances between singers and orchestra are also excellent. There are audio recordings of these same soloists working with Furtwangler in this and other operas during the early 1950s, so they were obviously quite used to working together.  Della Casa, Grummer, and Berger are the best in the females roles that I have heard, and I have seven recordings of this work, between CD and DVD releases.

1137829,5,7885880966,"This DVD brings to life 1954 Salzburg festival production of Don Giovanni. The very first shot of the camera is on Furtwangler, when he steps up t0 the conductor's plate and gives the gesture to the orchestera. And then sounds two terrifying cords signaling the beginning of the amazing performace.
The first thing that comes to your mind is how precise is Furtwangler with all the tempos. It is one of the most pedantic conducting you will ever hear. But this is how one should interpret Mozart. His music is so brilliant, it seems so simple, but in order to achieve this beauty and simplicity you have to be very organized when performing it. On this DVD this organization starts with Furtwangler and the amazing Salzburg orchestra and spreads to all the performers. I don't know with whom to start: Cesare Siepi is magnificant. His voice is so rich, so beautiful. He is probably the best Don Giovanni of 20th century. Also I want to mention Anton Dermota's Don Ottavio. Dermota is the best Don Ottavio you will ever hear. My favourite moment from this DVD is Donna Anna - Don Ottavio duet in the first scene. It makes you cry. Leporello, Commendatore, Donna Elvira, Mazetto, Zerlina - all are brilliant. Sound and video quality is surprisingly very  good.
This DVD is a masterpiece, especially for Mozart lovers. This is must have. Get it!!!",1079481600,14,1344,4.743589743589744
1137830,4,7885880966,"It is already evident that this is one of the must have DVD, the Vienna Philharmonic plays with the naturalness they possess with the weightiness and the seriousness of Furtwangler. The best thing about this is that Furtwangler is able to emphasize and bring the story into the climactic points. That is not all that Furtwangler does, he is able to set each scene in an instant whether it is romance, dark, misterious, anger or whatever, and he does it immediately (in orchestral entries especially, or other 'transition points' in scenes). At first it may seem dull, but it won't let you down!
One disappointment for me, was in film editing(or manipulating) right at the begining, with the overture where you can see Furtwangler conducting. The overture have slow section for about 2 minutes and follows a fast section for about 3 minutes. The slow part was great, no problem, but in the fast part where you see the Furtwangler from the front (about 4minutes and 21 seconds into the overture for about 6 seconds) they have copied the shot taken from the slow section (about 1 minute 09 seconds into the overture for about 14 seconds), sped the film up, and pasted onto the fast section. The music itself is unaffected and no problem, but Furtwangler was not conducting like that in that 6 seconds(I don't know if VHS of this had the same issue or not). It's only the matter of 6 seconds, and the disappointment level would vary according to people but for me it was an utter disappointment, I don't know if anybody have the nerve to 'copy and paste' like that...
Having said that, afterall it is a great buy of great opera being performed well and I would recommend it to anyone who loves opera or great music!",1073347200,13,1711,4.631578947368421
1137831,5,7885880966,"Furtwangler, the only composer to rise against the Nazis and defy their order in Germany also conducted an amazing performance of Don Giovanni here.  This is probably the BEST recorded version of Don Giovanni and the performance is top notch.  By the way, the sound quality is excellent, even if it is in mono, you don't even notice.  Don't ever let this great DVD pass you up, the performance, music, and conducting is one of the best you'll ever get to see.  True piece of art.",1061164800,19,479,4.534883720930233
1137832,5,7885880966,"Furtwangler's 1954 Salzburg production, now on DVD, is a wonderful historical document. Many reviewer's on this site criticise his slow tempi, but who are we  to criticise one of the greatest (if not the greatest) conductors of the 20th century? His ""colossal musical intellect"" (Opera Rough Guide)
applied to this work is nothing less than phenomenal. He views
this opera as a tragedy, rather than a comedy, and his well chosen ,but slower, speeds confirm this. He maintains the tension
throughout, letting the beauty of the details and inner voices  come out.
However he does spring to life when necessary and there is never a dull moment. In the overture, where we see him conduct, the first act finale and the finale itself you will see the master at his best!
The stage design and direction is
conventional, but this is not a modern production.
Cesare Siepi is definitely the best Don of his generation. He looks the part, acts with a great deal of flair and sings wonderfully. You will love the ""champagne aria"". He is a feast for the eye and ear, a triumph. The other singers are all first class. DVD sound is excellent.
One negative point perhaps: The overture return is ommitted.
 So is Don Ottavio's first aria (""Dalla sua pace""), for reasons unknown. This is unfortunate.
But still, my advice to you is: grab it while the supplies last!",1057622400,19,1347,4.747863247863248
1137833,5,7885880966,"I have gone back to this opera a third time.
Without any doubt, the jewel of the crown was Furtwangler albeit that Mozart was not exactly his favourite composer.  Vienna Philharmonic under the baton of Furtwanlger was so expressive and so full of drama, both by itself and when supporting the singers. And of course, the singers was a very strong team too, we have Siepi, Ernester, Grummer, Dermota, Casa, Edelmann, Berger and Berry...
Yes, in terms of psycho-analysis, we have a bit of Macbeth here instead of Midsummer Night's Dream in this opera. Mozart's  music was never meant to be singsongs as his soul always touches and concerns the breadth and depth of humanity. Was the Statute who put an end to the life of the rascal a symbol of his own father and Giovanni in a way Mozart himself subconsciously without himself knowing about it?

I watched this opera side by side with ""Dem Serail"", another Mozart opera produced by DG. The orchestra was Bayeriscshen conducted by Karl Bohm, another favourite conductor of mine.  With Bohm, we have perhaps a little more lyricism but we don't have the sort of fullest possible support to the singers as we have from Furtwangler. Nor was there the drama. The orchestra was nearly as good as Vienna Philharmonic, but the singers are remarkably weaker, and one would suppose that got nothing to do with the language in which it was sung for it intended by Mozart to be sung in German. So, despite the recording was made some twenty years later, technology alone doesn't help much.
Even as far as visual and audio effects go, one would say Giovanni is better.  It was so natural and pleasing. The conductor's interpretation is so modern in every way, with all those extrordinary lines from all these superb singers, one would hardly notice that it was a 1954 performance at all. Instead, Dem Serail sounds a bit outdated now.
Definitely a treasure, Strongly recommended.",1049587200,12,1913,4.784848484848485
7900434,3,7885880966,"Mozart is the real winner here. Many consider DG the finest opera ever written; I cannot make a good argument against that belief. Mozart brilliantly uses comedy to address the serious foibles of both men and women. What appears to be a comedy disguises very serious shortcoming in morality of his main characters...He address vanity, lechery and gullibility and fickleness in loyalty among est other issues and wraps it all up in some of the most glorious music ever written. Anyone who thinks Mozart wrote only delicate, pretty music needs to hear and see the last pages of the opera.

This was perhaps the last performance of the famous conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler who died two months later. Many consider him the fines conductor of his or any other time. I am not so sure of that. Many of the recordings he made were made during WWII and the sound was poor and I find it difficult to get too excited about many of his performances. He is usually somewhat deliberate or measured  but his flexible beat and ability to spring rhythms and maintain tension and great intensity, even at very leisurely speeds, seemed to work for most.

In any case the conducting, orchestral playing and the singing are all one could expect from all of the principals. Siepi is a magnificent Don; he was the probably the best Don Giovanni of his time. He looked, acted and sang as if he really was Don Juan. The rest of the cast were pretty much some of the best of their era

The reasons I only gave it three stars are for technical reasons. The sound is sort of limited 1954 monophonic sound and the 4X3 film aspect looks somewhat washed in color saturation and lacks the contrast and resolution you would expect to see today in a BluRray or even a standard modern DVD. I have many CD's recorded at about the same time that sound much better than this DVD. I own an excellent Joseph Krips conducted London/Decca CD set recorded about the same time in stereo also with Siepi and Della Casa that sounds much better. The DVD audio is not really bad, but it is not really good either and it detracts a good deal from the enjoyment of the opera. This seems strange for a professionally filmed performance originally made for commercial release as I think was the intent of the producers; it was not an amateurishly  shot video of a live performance

This is a great historical document of a great opera and performance that would be typical if you went to Salzburg or the Metropolitan Opera in the middle 1950's...very much golden age quality. This is a production of traditional values in set, costumes and acting and not in any way ""avant garde"" or what we would consider contemporary. For an only DVD, I would look for a more recent version with better sound and video; there are probably many that would also be very good performances. I recently viewed the Jarowski/Finley Glyndebourne Giovanni on EMI Classics. It is in modern dress and has excellent 5.1 sound and very good video quality; it makes an interesting contrast to the Furtwangler.",1521417600,,3028,4.650467289719626

7900441,5,7885880966,"When you get this magnificent DVD by Deutsche Grammophon, you get the subtitles in Italian, English, French, German, Spanish, and CHINESE! So the publisher is 100% certain of the worldwide appeal of this supreme masterpiece, even though it is in old-fashioned MONO sound (Salzburg Festival 1954). This was not the filming of a live performance on stage in the course of the Salzburg Festival  at the end,  the theater was turned into a studio where the filming and recording were done over many days of painstaking and tiring efforts by the whole team.

YouTube offers postings of this performance, one with subtitles in Spanish, another one with subtitles in English. But do get the DG DVD instead, as you don't want to be subjected to Spanish subtitles, which most of us, non-Spaniards, find most annoying anyway. And viewing the English subtitles is to me also another annoying feature. I much prefer to view the  Italian lyrics as subtitles, as the Italian words are so much more amusing and exciting, hotter and more full of passion than the somewhat cold and neutral English text offered in the subtitles. Da Ponte nailed that drama just perfectly right with a wonderful text, and it is a must to follow the syllables sung by the singers by reading in the subtitles the Italian text of this first-class libretto. Mozart never got a better one.

As so many reviewers have already commented, Siepi is the Don Giovanni for all times. Nobody comes close. And to have both Grmmer and Lisa Della Casa together is pure enchantment. And nobody does Leporello more convincingly than Edelmann. The whole cast is the best of all times too. The staging is superb and convincing, with no visible weakness. And Furtwngler delivers the nervous energy of the fabulous score. As a theatrical piece, this is simply tops. This is by far the Don Giovanni to have and enjoy for ever.

Don Giovanni is often considered one of the superlative operas of the repertory. And rightly so. Some, carried away by their enthusiasm, call it the ""best opera of them all"". Though that could be said of many other operas, depending on your taste and experience.
Stanley Sadie, in his edition of ""The NEW GROVE Book of OPERAS"", (Macmillan 1996), does present in fact his selection of the 250 operas most performed and most significant for English-speaking audiences in the last decades of the 20th c. Julian Rushton, one of the great experts on Mozart's operas, presents there a lengthy and in-depth detailed analysis of Don Giovanni, which is remarkably insightful and instructive. A must read. But  Rushton prefers to emphasize the novelty in Mozart's late operas of the synthesis of ""buffo"" (comic) and ""seria"" (tragic) styles, which is so marked in Don Giovanni. And he refuses to rhapsodize on any claimed super excellence of Don Giovanni over all other operas.

In the same spirit,  let's not be misled into falling for the idolatry of believing that this Don Giovanni represents the absolute, unmatchable peak of Mozart's music. The opera owes a great deal to the story concocted by Da Ponte, and his taut, exciting, forward -moving libretto  as much as to the rich, complex music written by Mozart, elated in the flush of the exciting reception he received from his fans in Prague.
But Mozart never wanted to write another Don Giovanni again. As is clear from the next three operas he wrote in the following years, which have no immediate relation to the music in Don Giovanni. Each of Mozart's operas is different and sui generis, one of a kind, each one beautiful in its own right thanks to the unlimited musical creativity of the composer, so manifest ever since he started writing operas as a teenager in Salzburg in 1767, at the age of 11, on his return from the ""Grand Tour"" of Europe that made him an international celebrity.
I love Don Giovanni, but I love as well the graceful, energizing and scintillating music of Mozart's youthful operas, such as ""La Betulia Liberata"" or ""Ascanio in Alba"", ""Mitridate"", ""Il Re Pastore"", or ""La Finta Giardiniera"". And I've been able to listen to Cosi every day for a full summer, something which I could not do with the ""heavy"" Don Giovanni.

But no other of Mozart's operas has been so masterfully performed as this exceptional Don Giovanni. We are so unbelievably lucky to have this great film! Thank God that we live in this extraordinarily blessed period when we have DG to deliver this in full color and full sound.
Amazingly, when you watch Furtwngler's dynamic conducting and majestic figure in this glorious DVD, you couldn't guess that he was to die only a few months later in Nov. 1954.'",1456444800,3,4621,4.821969696969697
