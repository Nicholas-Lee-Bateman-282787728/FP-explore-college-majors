It far exceeds my expectations! The quality, clarity and smoothness of the filming is awesome! The scenery is beautiful!
This DVD is a great way to exercise and stay fit indoors, while you feel like you are outside in a gorgeous setting, hearing the sounds of nature at it's best!
My first 3 days so far, I exercised 80 minutes each day, while walking through a rainforest! Another trail beckons me...do one more trail! Imagine walking down a trail and passing elephants! Awesome!
I highly recommend this DVD and can't wait to buy more!",1386720000,3,627,4.709090909090909
1172802,5,9089705961,I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas as she is a marathon runner and runs inside during the winter months and likes to use your video's.  We purchased one last year as well.  She loved it and said she feels like she's right in the midst of the video!,1386115200,3,260,4.18

7901404,5,9089705961,"Whether you want to exercise on a treadmill or an exercise bike, on this DVD you will find something for both fitness equipment. The recordings on this DVD are very nice and clear. Here you walk or cycle on pretty lonely roads or trails through the rainforest. The vegetation is very dense and wonderfully green and usually you can see the sun's rays through the trees. The natural ambient sounds make the DVD even more realistic, you can hear crickets chirping or birds singing. A very nice DVD with magnificent shots, perfect for nature and fitness fans. If you don`t want to work out with the DVD, you can only watch it from the sofa, it is wonderfully relaxing. With this DVD you can get the rainforest just into his living room.",1446249600,,733,4.5606060606060606

7901406,2,9089705961,"This is not a rainforest at all, just roads through an Asian neighborhood. That's disappointing enough, but it also has a loud annoying high-pitched sound throughout the video, I can't even stand to keep the sound on because of it. Many of these DVDs are great but this one is just awful....",1422403200,,291,4.615384615384615
7901407,1,9089705961,Very little rain forest and not at all what I expected!  Could see the same looking out at the woods in my back yard!  Had hoped it would be a virtual walk through a rain forest for my 5th graders studying the habitat.  So very disappointed.  I wouldn't even enjoy it on my treadmill.  Total waste of money.,1411689600,2,307,4.224137931034483

7901409,3,9089705961,"This is my first purchase of this type of product.  I expected more.  While it was good looking at the trees and forest, I became bored.  I wanted to see more.",1405900800,,159,4.064516129032258
7901410,5,9089705961,"I like to have something to look at while walking or jogging on the treadmill. This dvd (and two others in this series that I also own) are great, because there are several different ""trips"" to choose from to keep it interesting and varied. This one adds up to 115 minutes total if you watch them all straight through (which is a lot more minutes than some of the other options out there -- some of which are only 30 minutes)). I like that the individual trips will automatically loop,  for when I just want an additional few minutes more on the treadmill, I don't have to stop and change the dvd player. Overall, the quality of the videos is reasonable -- this isn't HD quality however, but there is minimal shaking around during the walks, and the scenes within each trip transition fairly seemlessly in a non-distracting way.",1402444800,,828,4.557046979865772
7901411,5,9089705961,"I love this DVD to work out on my elliptical trainer.  It provides unique scenery in pathways through exotic foliage.  Sometimes I see bananas and what might be papayas? hanging in the trees, and yes, of course elephants on that one road!  Cannot fully express my joy and admiration for this footage but I can tell you, personally, it lifts my spirits and has been especially helpful now in the winter as we are experiencing a Polar Vortex where I live.  This video (along with my heater and fan to simulate tropical air) is improving my disposition - no cabin fever here!  You can play it along with your own Zen garden instrumental music to enhance the experience, or without - to hear the tropical sounds of birds, bugs, and creatures (I thought I heard a Yeti) lurking beyond the paths.  Oh, and I especially love to ""glide"" downhill on my elliptical on Elephant Jungle Road - once I almost careened into the elephants!  Rainforest Track has stunning cinematography with the shadows of the palms upon the reddish road with sunlight glinting through the canopy of lush green foliage against blue skies!  Seriously I cannot exercise anymore without this gorgeous visual stimuli - what a luxury!",1391212800,4,1196,4.771844660194175
7901412,4,9089705961,"Very nicely shot. No bounce, just beautiful calming running scenes.
Would be great if they released in high definition i must add thou.
Maybe less tracks with better quality if they limited to DVD sizes.",1390953600,,203,4.828571428571428
