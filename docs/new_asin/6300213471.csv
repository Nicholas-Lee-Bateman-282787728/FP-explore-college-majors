One of the few times in history where Hollywood really glorifies God.  They tried to ridicule their religion but they couldn't.",1398643200,,143,5.217391304347826
7805537,1,6300213471,"I have never liked the Star Trek episodes that deal with Earth parallels. Am I to assume that the whole galaxy is made up of Romans, Gangsters from the 1920s, Nazis, and Yankees and Communists? Give me a break!",1242259200,,210,4.410256410256411
7805538,4,6300213471,"First off, make no mistake that this is a show about ancient Rome, 60s TV, and (what is unique for Trek) a mildly pro-Christian message.

In short, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy visit a planet that is essentially 1960's Earth (there's that implausible parallel-evolution premise again) except that Rome never fell. The reason Rome never fell, as it turned out, is that Jesus was born 2,000 years later or for some reason the message of the ""Son worshippers"" (believed at first to be ""sun worshippers"") never got out until recently. And Rome not falling turns out to be a bad, bad thing.

Probably the best thing about this episode is the use of televised gladitorial games to satirize 1960's TV and Nielsen ratings, which if you'll recall, classic Trek struggled so much with. This episode has one of the best lines of the entire series: ""If you lower our ratings, Flavius, we'll do a special on you!""

Another thing notable about the show is that the evil Proconsul admires Kirk and so wants to give him a gift before killing him... a night with the Proconsul's lovely blonde slave girl. The scene is one of Kirk's better love scenes. However, the sexism in the writing becomes clear in a line of dialogue in a subsequent scene. Kirk says (about the previous night): ""They threw me a few curves."" This is the sort of non-PC writing that, for better or worse, we were never to see in TNG etc.",1181865600,3,1385,4.59919028340081
7805539,5,6300213471,"I am a very big Star Trek fan, especially the original series.  I haven't seen too many of them that I didn't care for.  Bread and Circuses wasn't one of the scientific episodes, but deals more with barbarians from a different world.

 kirk, Spock, and Mcoy beams down to a planet in search of a crew who had disappeared years earlier.  Getting, there, they find the captain of the missing crew has joined with the barbarians of this planet who love to have arena fights til the death.

  Kirk is faced with the decision of watching Mcoy and Spock die in the arena, or call the rest of his crew down to face the arena.

 The best part of this movie, is Spock and Mcoy's conversation while they are in their cell.  It shows how Spock and Mcoy feels about each other and it's an excellent dialogue and makes the show definetly worth seeing.",1151798400,,838,4.376623376623376
7805540,5,6300213471,"'Bread and Circuses',hmmm? When I saw this episode I thought the worshippers of the 'sun' were christians,but when I became older,I later interpreted the worshippers of the 'sun' as worshippers of Japan. the 'fish'(Peter the fisherman) has been the sign of christians and never the 'sun',but for Japan the standard of the 'sun'(Land of the rising sun) has been the national standard and flag of Japan. A lot of are architecture,religion,and ideals are rooted from ancient Rome. For instance like 'football'(resemble Gladitorial games),months of the year 'July' (Julius Caesar),'August' (Augustus Caesar),the United States 'Senate'(Roman Senate),and the architecture resembles that of ancient Rome. I would also like to state that Julius Caesar conquered the island of Britain,and later Britain conquered America which makes America also Roman,not to mention you have a 'Pontiff' in Rome like the ancient days. Is the Roman Empire really dead? Do the answers of the future come from Japan,the 'land of the rising sun'. Lots of people called Marcellus,Marcus,Antonius(Anthony),Augustus(Gus),and Octavia(female). Like a Richard Wagner opera,'Star Trek' opens up the imagination and intellect. Have fun,that's the idea.",1032048000,2,1215,5.793296089385475
7805541,4,6300213471,"TOS was a great series, granted. It gave us an optimistic prophesy of the future not always present in SciFi. This episode is engaging, if a bit far-fetched scientifically. What would the world be like if the Romans had never been conquered?  Alternative history is always fun, but this would have been far more plausible if they had traveled to another dimension rather than another planet within our universe.  However, it is sad to watch episode after episode of Trek and discover that one's people simply ceased to exist, or so it seems. Even Worf in TNG can be Jewish, but God forbid that Christians be present. The brief glimpses therefore are all the more dear, as one finds in this episode. It's worth it for the last few lines.",978912000,14,736,4.653846153846154
7805542,5,6300213471,Another episode on my Top 25 list. There's plenty of action,939859200,,59,4.454545454545454
