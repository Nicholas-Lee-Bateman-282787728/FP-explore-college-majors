Before buying DVD's for overseas players, be very careful you are getting aDVD you can play...I returned the others I bought for this reason.",1425945600,,246,4.466666666666667
5658028,5,B00BNAE6JM,Thanks Caesar for showing me what I need to learn to do so my dogs can be rehabilitated and I can be trained.,1425772800,,109,3.782608695652174
5658029,5,B00BNAE6JM,"My family and I have really enjoyed this series. Different from the Dog Whisperer show, this series doesn't focus quite as much on the rehabilitation of each dog, rather on the rehoming aspect after the dog is rescued/rehabilitated. We appreciate Cesar's continued effort to promote the concept of taking dogs that will otherwise be euthanized /put down for various reasons, rescuing them, helping them overcome their issues/fears and giving them a second chance. Beautiful message!",1420588800,2,482,5.44
5658030,5,B00BNAE6JM,"Reminds me of the series ""Who Gets the Dog"" that used to be on AP.  I so miss the Dog Whisperer  (have all the dvds that were done) and had already decided that I probably wouldn't like Leader of the Pack but wanted to see.  Didn't think I could handle 2 candidates not getting the dog without crying and started going off on Cesar.  But I was surprised and I now understand the workings of this show and actually started getting into watching it.  I was disappointed that the actual rehab techniques did not play a bigger part, DW was a lot better in that aspect but I found myself getting caught up in how Cesar looked at the potential of all three candidates in each show.  Some candidates acted like they just wanted to be on TV but, on the whole, I ended up liking what he has done.  What a hard decision it has to be for him to make as to who is Leader of the Pack.  No matter what anyone says, I adore Cesar and wish I had his skills and calm-assertive energy/confidence with dogs.  IMO, his downfall came from jealous wanna-be's and accusers.  There are people won't like this show so I won't recommend for everyone but now I can see what it stands for now and hope there is a Leader of the Pack Season 2 DVD set to buy.",1403654400,4,1228,4.165254237288136
5658031,4,B00BNAE6JM,"As the series opens we see Cesar operating out of a new dog psychology center in a picturesque location. The contestants are British.  There is no narrative to disclose Cesar's new circumstances.  Eventually it emerges that filming took place over one summer in Spain at a pastoral ""Centro Canino.""  Contestants travel to Spain, possibly on their own dime since they appear to be people of abundant means to say the least.

Dog lovers compete for the chance to adopt problem cases brought to Cesar by animal rescue organizations.  Only one of the finalists can win!  After a couple of challenges, Cesar assesses their suitability to adopt the problem dog.  (The dorky new term for pet adoption is ""rehoming.""  As in rehoming pigeons?)

Before the final round, one player or set of players is eliminated.  No, there isn't a ""walk of shame,"" nor does Cesar declare ""You ARE the doggy douchebag!  Goodbye.""

At the end of the final round, absurdly suspenseful music underscores the anxious moments as Cesar recaps the merits and mistakes of the two finalists.  The camera zooms in on the expectant faces.  An the winner IS....!

The game is sorta fun as you try to guess who the winner will be.  You can congratulate yourself if you're right or if not, be incredulous.  We don't get to see everything Cesar saw so it's hard to second-guess him.  The show is a tear-jerker.  The dogs are considered hopeless cases, with a death sentence or life in a cage the likely outcome.

Ferocious felonious canines from the shelter calm down and improve greatly as soon as Cesar takes charge.  It makes me wonder how much work with the dogs takes place off camera.  The newly malleable dogs don't lend much suspense to the challenges.  A minor slip-up will knock a contestant out of contention.  For example, allowing a dog to jump on you at first meeting.

In order to properly evaluate Leader of the Pack you have to forget you ever saw Dog Whisperer, one of the finest television programs ever produced.  If you didn't know Dog Whisperer existed you might think Leader of the Pack was an excellent show.  The game captures two essential components:  The worldwide problem of abandoned pets and Cesar's uncanny talent as a teacher.  The show manages to convey a remarkable amount of useful knowledge about dog (and human) behavior.  The series is shot in highly attractive locales, presumably around Spain, as well as in Italy, Britain, and the Netherlands.

Only recently did Cesar discover hugging.  Now it's exhausting watching Cesar hug everything in sight.  Enough with the hugging already!

And now a word from our sponsors:
Petco and Subaru, Cesar's sponsors, go out of their way to embarrass themselves.  Every show features a lengthy approach by a Subaru Forester dawdling through the countryside toward Centro Canino.  Cesar finally emerges at the front door while the camera lingers on ""Forester.""  In one episode, ""Forester"" is blurred out, presumably because the contractually required number of exposures had been reached.  Another time, the problem dog is delivered in a minivan from one of Subaru's competitors.  The logo on the van is taped over!

Yes, Dog Whisperer had a car sponsor, but the footage showed Cesar making emergency house calls (part of the show's humor).  You actually saw Cesar driving.  When we see the Subaru meander through the Spanish countryside it's just stock footage.  Cesar's probably not even at the wheel.

In a solemn ceremony Cesar presents the winner with a gift from Petco like it's a trophy from Westminster Kennel Club.  It looks to be $20 worth of dog trinkets tossed into a basket.  Petco has no stores in Europe and probably has a weak commitment to the show.

Leader of the Pack looks to be a weak show with an uncertain future.  It doesn't help that the show airs on Nat Geo WILD, only available with top-tier cable TV packages ($75 or so).  Too rich for my blood.  I'm reduced to borrowing the DVDs from the local library.",1374451200,15,3967,4.830357142857143
8571559,5,B00BNAE6JM,Cesar Millan Leader of the Pack season 1 arrived on time and in new condition. Cesar makes dog training look easy. I've never been that successful but still enjoy watching him achieve remarkable results.,1484870400,,203,5.0
8571560,2,B00BNAE6JM,"Too many dogs are labeled as 'bad' and end up in shelters through no fault of their own. I like the fact that homeless dogs are placed in compatible homes in this series. It is wonderful to see how much of an owner/dog relationship is dependent on knowledge and a proper 'match' with a compatible dog. The world needs more awareness in this area.

That being said, I think the shows are boring and repetitive. After you have watched a couple you know the routine. I think it is great these dogs get wonderful homes that are compatible with the dogs needs but this could be accomplished without an audience.

I would skip this purchase.",1483833600,,635,4.51304347826087

The only annoying thing is the attempt of typical reality show drama.....
""Only one of you can be the leader of the pack for......"" , just pathetic.
