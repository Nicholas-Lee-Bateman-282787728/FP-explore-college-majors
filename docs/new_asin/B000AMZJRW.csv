2389858,5,B000AMZJRW,"M&eacute;moires affectives is the story of a man named Alexandre Tourneur who awakens from a year-long coma with no memory of whom he is. He doesn't recognize friends or family. With the help of a police detective, he tries to put the pieces of his life together again.

But the pieces keep changing shape. People tell him stories, then completely contradict themselves mere moments later. It happens again and again. Are they lying? Whose memory is affected? Alexander is searching throughout the film, but for what? For whom? The person who unintentionally awakened him from his coma? The person who caused the accident which put him in a coma in the first place? Or is there something else?

I can't say more without spoiling the film but I can definitely understand why both the movie and Roy Dupuis (as Alexandre) won both the Jutra (the Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois ""Academy Award) and the Genie (the Canadian ""Academy Award""). You have to see it to believe it.",1130976000,28,962,4.895705521472393
2389859,4,B000AMZJRW,"In all candor, I purchased this dvd because I am so intrigued by Roy Dupuis in the La Femme Nikita series. I had read about his popularity and status in Canada; when I heard about this new release and the critical acclaim it received, curiosity overwhelmed me.  This is not a conventional, traditional plot driven movie.  I don't say that by way of criticism but rather to inform.  One has to pay close attention to keep track of what is going on and even then it's purposefully confusing, much like ""Memento.""  At the end of the movie I had any number of unanswered questions. That's not always a bad thing--that a movie causes you to think and wonder is sometimes the hallmark of a good film.  I enjoyed Dupuis' performance. If you get the chance, I recommend this movie.  Just don't expect the expected or you will be disappointed.",1126137600,16,834,4.563758389261745
8078925,5,B000AMZJRW,This is a thought provoking film with a beautifully nuanced performance by Roy Dupuis.  You will need to watch it more than once to understand the subtle and unique plot.,1411776000,,170,4.666666666666667
8078926,5,B000AMZJRW,"I bought the movie under recommendation and truly loved it.  I bought it primarily because Roy Dupuis was in it, but the film was terrific too.  I recommend this to everyone. The ending was unexpected.",1376956800,,201,4.714285714285714
8078927,5,B000AMZJRW,"Since you don't have this movie in stock and might not again, why can't customers view it online for a price. I don't like the idea of not having access to any of Roy Dupuis movies. Can I get an answer? I would love to rate it if I could see the actual movie. He is a very good actor from other movies I have seen him in, for that matter tv shows.",1347408000,2,347,3.767123287671233
8078928,5,B000AMZJRW,"Excellent performances, beautiful scenery.  I will definitely watch it again, to catch anything that I might have missed the first time.  I love that it is a mystery for the viewer as well as the character, instead of knowing all of the answers and just watching him struggle to figure out what is going on. For fellow Roy Dupuis fans: he is even more stunning than he was as Michael Samuelle, which I did not think was possible.  I could not get this movie anywhere in the U.S., so I logged onto Amazon.ca and found a seller who would ship to the U.S.  This movie is well worth a few extra dollars in shipping and a longer shipping time (mine took 10 days).",1343692800,,658,4.32520325203252
8078929,5,B000AMZJRW,"I'll admit it. I only bought it because Roy Dupuis was the principle actor. I knew next to nothing about this movie. I will say that the ending makes you think.

Basically, Roy plays a man who awoke from a coma with no memory of who he is or anyone else in his life. The movie is about that journey and discovering what is true and isn't. What I really ruminated on after the movie was this question: Having recovered his memory, does Alexander set about putting things right in his life with those around him or does recovering his memory affect him in such a way that things return back to status quo? It's an interesting question - what are we but the sum of our memories? It's an amazing story that took several viewings to fully grasp the concepts.

For those Dupuis fans who want an English dubbed movie, this isn't it. But it was a treat hearing him speak his native tongue. I wish more American audiences were exposed to his work. Roy's performance here is evocative of his performance in the ""La Femme Nikita"" episode called 'Not Was,' in which Michael lost his memory. As then, here Roy changes his voice, mannerisms, body language, all to convey an uncertainty inherent in him as he has no memory. A blank slate. This role really expanded his range and I love it. It's now a favorite of mine.",1323734400,,1303,4.425

8078934,4,B000AMZJRW,"I LIKED THIS MOVIE. I THOUGHT ROY DUPUIS PERFORMANCE WAS GREAT. HE CAN SAY SO MUCH WITH HIS EYES, FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AND BODY LANGUAGE. I THOUGHT THE ENDING WAS A LITTLE ABRUPT AFTER HE GOT HIS MEMORY BACK. BUT OVERALL A GOOD MOVIE.",1232064000,4,232,4.4186046511627906
