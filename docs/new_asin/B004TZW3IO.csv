8441117,5,B004TZW3IO,"Che Bella Giornata (2011) is a fast-moving comedy, with many non-stop
comical moments over 90 minutes, as well as many human aspects that
European film fans have learned to appreciate, adding a special Italian
cultural touch to the contexts.

The script is part comedy, part romantic-comedy, loosely based in Milan.
Added to those, there's an underlying sarcastic and nihilist philosphy for
those who are ""out of the loop"" in terms of an overall competitive social
enviroment, that is heavily dependent on the  charisma,  and high-placed
personal contacts that an individual is required to have, at all levels of
society, to get their goal achieves to a greater or less degree.

There are many brave, slightly borderline elements that Hollywood would
almost certainly never touch with a 10 foot pole, such as the melting pot
in Italy of multiple cultures, the repercussions and concerns that citizens
have, resulting from a globalist foreign military intervention abroad, from
the sheer numbers of members of those foreign countries, residing as
communities in Europe itself, coupled with modern elements, such as  social
media (Facebook). Thus, some aspects change, others have not changed,
claims the movie.

At the end, many fans will be touched by the story: from the happy ending,
and the romantic elements (obviously, too good to be true, for some) but
also from the slap-stick elements, coming from this Mediterranean country
having the year-round warm climate and a rich history, culture and
character.

Lastly, some actors in the work are well known, such as Ivano Marescotti,
who is also in LA VITA FACILE also released this year, in 2011, bringing
added credibility. The protagonist, Checco Zalone is effective, with a
natural acting method.",1314921600,,1752,5.235714285714286
