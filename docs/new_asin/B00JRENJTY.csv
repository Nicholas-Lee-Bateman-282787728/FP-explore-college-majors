6389416,5,B00JRENJTY,All 72 video nasties are covered in the most educational and entertaining documentary available on cinema censorship of low budget horror films. If you enjoy trailers of drive-in or grindhouse movies you will definitely enjoy this. If you recall VHS rental stores or horror films of the 80's watching this will bring back fond memories. This 3 DVD collection includes the documentary on disc I (with interviews of cinema critics and the law makers who broke their own law to ban violent VHS tapes in the U.K.). Ruggero Deodato briefly discusses Cannibal Holocaust. Disc 2 has trailers for all the banned Video Nasties which can be seen with or without a introduction on why the film was banned. Disc 3 has trailers for the films that were intially banned then released and can be seen with out without an introduction. There is really nothing negative to say about this DVD set because it is the definitive guide.,1411948800,2,913,4.821656050955414

6389418,5,B00JRENJTY,"Another amazing set from the people who brought us Grindhouse Trailer Classics, this collection serves as not only a fantastic trailer comp but a fascinating history lesson as well (and BOY are there lessons to learn...)!
The idiology behind the Video Nasties list was simply iditotic, pandering to the fears of ""upstanding"" British citizens by delivering the standard amount of BS the usually goes along with propaganda. The footage of VHS tapes being burned is particularily disturbing, as one cannot help but recall the days of Nazi book-burning.
The tidbits and ""fun facts"" preceeding all of the trailers are excellent.  And although the trailers vary in quality - some obviously from DVD releases, some obviously from VHS - it was great that Nucleus was able to gather all of the trailers (and, yes, ALL of the Video Nasties trailers are here)!
After holding onto a bootleg copy of the UK release, it was nice to add an offically-released copy of this set to my library.  If you're even somewhat interested, I would advise you to do the same.",1407542400,,1047,4.876404494382022

6389420,5,B00JRENJTY,"This 3-disc set was originally released as an individually numbered limited edition version complete with collectible poster postcards in the UK several years ago.  But Severin in the US has now issued an NTSC version here in the States!!!  I had the UK version, but never even watched it because I only have one all-region multi-format player and so it got put on the back burner. Anyway, sold it off in anticipation of this US version.

First of all, the US version is not limited, numbered, and doesn't have the collectible postcards the UK version had, but otherwise I assume it's pretty much the same content on the discs.

Disc 1 is the documentary itself, and although it is decent, I found it a bit pedantic and I found I was losing interest even though it's only about 72 minutes long.  Still some good info there, but it really seemed to lack the chronological details of how the whole thing progressed, step by step, and instead mostly focused on current interview clips (one with one of the censors at the time) spouting their feelings on what was going on at the time.  I remember reading the book ""The Seduction of the Gullible"" (I think the first book about the Video Nasty situation) over 20+ years ago and that was a fascinating, compelling read.  This documentary, not so much.

But Disc 2 and 3 is where this set really shines.  It's basically all the trailers for the entire group of Nasties.  Disc 2 has the 39 films that remained banned at that time, and Disc 3 has the other 33 films that were dropped from the banned list after a short period.  Although I was originally going to watch just the trailers (the discs allow you to just watch the trailers, or watch them with intros by selected talents or critics), I finally decided to watch everything with the intros and I'm glad I did.  Heck, I know all of these films, saw most when they first came out theatrically in the US, and know their backstories and all that, but the intros here, for the most part, just add some real flair to all of this and elevate it beyond just another trailer compilation disc.  It's great to hear opinions on the films from some of the most respected genre critics out there, especially Kim Newman and Stephen Thrower.  Both these guys are a real pleasure to listen to, and I laughed and agreed with almost everything each one said about the particular films they introduced.  They truly know their stuff.  As does Marc Morris, who is also on hand and always clever.  There are some other 'talents' that I didn't really know, and may be more well known in the UK, who introduce certain films and most do a good job.  There's a goth-type girl who would normally irritate me, but she's actually cool and endearing; but another girl named Emily Booth kind of irritated me as her delivery was way too forced and fake (she's also obviously just reading her script off a teleprompter, which is really off-putting), but not a dealbreaker.  All the other participants really do a fine job, though, and although I'm sure they were prepared in advance, they don't feel as scripted.  Even Allan Bryce (the controversial editor of The Dark Side magazine in the UK, which plagiarized tons of print and on-line writers' articles) comes off good.  Maybe a documentary should be made about THAT someday!  ;)  Anyway, watch the trailers with the intros, it does make it more fun.

Not a perfect set, but it was obviously a total labor of love so definitely deserves 5-stars.  And it's a great encapsulation of the 72 banned films, and each video box cover is shown and discussed, each movie is commented on, and each movie has a trailer, some of them so rare that they were not even on the DVD releases of the films.  A must buy.",1401580800,8,3719,4.563253012048193
6389421,4,B00JRENJTY,"Video Nasties (2010) is one of the better horror film documentaries I have ever seen although Never Sleep Again and Crystal Lake Memories are superior. It talks about the moral outrage that erupted in Britain over the renting of so-called video nasties. These horror movies were actually banned and prosecuted such was the concern over them. Only recently have the films been re-released uncut in the UK and US (although a few still aren't available). Video Nasties exposes the arbitrary decisions over what was in good taste or not. Ultimately, many of the films weren't particularly good and probably would have been quickly forgotten if the debate hadn't been stirred up by the media. Some of the more interesting fan favorites did attract legal trouble such as The Burning, Cannibal Holocaust, I Spit on Your Grave, Last House on the Left, Tenebrae, Zombi and many more. Discs 2 & 3 can be viewed either as a non-stop trailer show, or with newly-filmed introductions from a wide range of acclaimed media academics and notable genre journalists. Each disc is preceded by a brief introduction by cult horror presenter Emily Booth.

Box Cover: ""Every Video Nasty critiqued and explored, followed by the original trailers, for the first time ever on DVD! Prepare to be corrupted and depraved once more with this definitive guide to the Video Nasties phenomenon - one of the most extraordinary and scandalous eras in the history of British film. For the first time ever on DVD, TRAILERS to all 72 films that fell foul of the Director of Public Prosecutions are featured with specially filmed intros for each title in a lavish three-disc collector's edition box-set, alongside a brand new documentary - VIDEO NASTIES: MORAL PANIC, CENSORSHIP AND VIDEOTAPE.""

Disc One: The era-defining and critically acclaimed documentary VIDEO NASTIES: MORAL PANIC, CENSORSHIP AND VIDEOTAPE directed by Jake (Doghouse) West and produced by Marc Morris features interviews with filmmakers Neil Marshall ('The Descent', 'Doomsday'), Christopher Smith ('Severance', 'Black Death') and MP Graham Bright as well as rare archive footage featuring James Ferman (director of the BBFC 1975-1999) & Mary Whitehouse. Taking in the explosion of home video, the erosion of civil liberties, the introduction of draconian censorship measures, hysterical press campaigns and the birth of many careers born in blood and videotape, West's documentary also reflects on the influence this peculiar era still exerts on us today.

Disc Two: The 39 titles that were successfully prosecuted in UK courts and deemed liable to deprave and corrupt. These included: 'Absurd', 'Cannibal Holocaust', 'The Driller Killer', 'I Spit on Your Grave', 'Nightmares in a Damaged Brain', 'Snuff' & 'Zombie Flesh-Eaters'.

Disc Three: The 33 titles that were initially banned, but then subsequently acquitted and removed from the DPP's list. These included: 'Death Trap', 'Deep River Savages', 'The Evil Dead', 'Human Experiments', 'The Toolbox Murders' & 'Zombie Creeping Flesh'.

This is a Region 2 DVD collection so make sure you have compatible equipment before you purchase it because it has to be imported from the UK and doesn't play on US Blu-ray or DVD players.",1380326400,12,3213,5.255360623781677
8653560,5,B00JRENJTY,"Probably THE greatest remaster Severin has ever released.  As a legal paying consumer I have the right to know if the movie I'm buying is censored or not.  If I can even buy it all like Blood on Satan's Claw?  Why does it not exist here in the states but has a UK dvd and bluray?  Where is Drop Dead Dearest, that one can't be found anywhere at all, yet no one is insisting it's a lost film?  Censorship, in a nutshell, is usually the first step taken to destabilize an otherwise functional economy and cause political strife.  Why would any country want to do this?  All most of us want to do is come home from a long day's work and kick back with some beer and popcorn and watch a cheap entertaining movie.  The people have the right to know when crud like this happens.  Every 30 years it seems like there is some unfounded morality crusade launched against art and pop culture as a scapegoat to evade and deny corruption from the highest courts.",1528848000,,949,4.31638418079096

As a long time horror fan who remembers a time when you had to put some effort into tracking down 'uncut' versions of movies, I thought this would be a pretty entertaining disc - if it was difficult in America, imagine how it was in Britain while all of this was going on, right?

Well, the documentary itself starts out pretty interesting, but shortly becomes extremely repetitive. In a nutshell, some people who really had no qualifications to do so were given authority by the government to determine what others should be allowed to view - Particularly horror, or other violent movies.  An interesting topic for sure.  Problem is, nearly everybody interviewed here had the same thing to say, and it got old pretty quick.  The trailer selection itself was pretty good, but ultimately everything here is available on other compilations.

The feature I was most looking forward to, the introductions to the trailers was the biggest letdown of all.  I made it through about 1/2 of them before I had to stop - These were the most inane, rambling, repetitive commentaries I have ever heard.  I was suprised that such an interesting event in time could be made to sound so completely boring.  You would have thought whoever slapped these together would have told these guys before rolling tape 'Ok, X,Y & Z have been covered to death - talk about something else' Nope. Imagine interviewing 30 people who were at an event about their memories of the experience.  They would probably all have something to say, but all accounts would be remarkably similar, and might not necessarily be interesting.  Now, imagine that every one of those subjects looked completely uncomfortable with being filmed talking about it, yet seemed like they felt compelled to keep talking.  That is this disc in a nutshell.  If you are going to speak on a subject at length and record it for posterity, at least try to say something unique or entertaining.  The people who put this out didn't even really believe in what they were doing - they even got some lame scantily clad goth chick you've never heard of involved in attempt to keep people watching.  Definitively boring and repetitive.",1441497600,2,2210,4.794195250659631

8653566,5,B00JRENJTY,"This set isn't called the Definitive Guide for nothing. The Video Nasties is a very fascinating period in time; not only for the impact it had on VHS culture, but very much on cinema as a whole. There are many, critics and politicians alike, who balk at horror/exploitation films and point to them as the beginning of the decline of Western civilization. The sad truth, however, is that horror/exploitation is STILL a vulnerable genre. Many of those films contain no more violence, or at least violence no more graphic than, some of the critically lauded ""classics"" of cinema. Think of the graphic violence from films like, say, The Godfather, Bonnie & Clyde, Goodfellas, etc. Yet where was the ban on them?

But I digress, this is space for a review of the Video Nasties documentary. And what a docu it is. Director Jake West wisely chooses to present the events as they were, instead of shaking a finger at the BBFC and the British government as a whole. It IS scary to see how easily civil liberties were cast aside in the name of building a nanny nation. What's even scarier is the lack of accountability from many of the political members involved. Video interviews show how many of these pearl-clutchers openly admitted they never actually watched any of the tapes that were supposedly destroying the innocence of the nation's youth. But again, West declines judgement. That much is left to many of the interview subjects who found themselves on the ""wrong"" side of the law.

The docu is chock full of carefully researched info on the inception of the term Video Nasty, the beginning of the ban list, those who faced or might face criminal charges, and the ""end"" of the Video Nasties Witch hunt. Interview subjects range from film makers who were involved in the production of said Nasties, shop owners who bore the wrath of the government, some of those government officials themselves, to modern-day directors and writers who very clearly wear the influence of the Nasties with pride. It's the diverse range of interviews and research that give this a more well-rounded look at the subject than most fluff pieces and/or one-sided documentaries on some film subjects. Of course, the docu itself is the academic aspect, looking more at the time period itself than the films themselves.

That's where the other 2 discs come in. For those who might find the docu boring, discs 2 and 3 are where the fun begins. Disc 2 lists the 39 (of 72 from the banned list) film titles that were successfully deemed to have a corruptible influence on the UK youth, and prosecuted as such. There are 2 viewing options on this disc. One is to watch just the trailers for the films on a straight shot, not unlike the 42nd Street Forever DVDs. The other is to watch not only the trailers, but intros and information beforehand from a wide array of directors, writers, collectors, and personalities. I personally prefer the latter. It's fascinating seeing the critical analysis of these trailers, many of which, through modern eyes anyway, seem downright tame. Fair warning, though. Watching the trailers with intros WILL eat up about 3-4 hours of your time. For the intellectual bloodhound, though, it's 3-4 hours well spent. The same goes for disc 3, which goes into the remaining 33 film titles whose bans were eventually lifted in the UK.

I HIGHLY recommend this guide for any stripe of film fan out there. There have been countless books written on the subject, as well as books detailing the VHS cover art of these beauties, but for a fully immersive experience, you can do no better than this.",1416182400,,3586,4.788368336025848
8653567,1,B00JRENJTY,"Yeah, right. On first DVD some old guys talk non-stop for two hours--why I wanna listen to them and not the nasties is mystery.

The content of the other discs is where the dvd set shines.
