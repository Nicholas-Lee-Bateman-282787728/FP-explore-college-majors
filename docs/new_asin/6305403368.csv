1026130,5,6305403368,This movie gave a beautiful insite to the effect war has on a person. A unique setting in which soldier and civilian either losses or finds themselves. Every time I watch this movie I find myself deeply touched and  find myself in Maryanne's search for herself. Often miltary style movies  don't show the depth of the soul searching aspect that a soldier goes  through and the  psychological conflicts that can be brought back from war.  In this incident the conflict was brough to the war field and Skeet Urlich  portraits this loss exceptionally well. Not only was Skeet's performance  exception so to were the performances of all actors involved. I have no  doubt that this movie will remain a favourite of mine for the rest of my  life.,964396800,12,740,4.71875
1026131,5,6305403368,It is a movie that I recomend to everyone. It is not an ordinary film. Although it is a story but it is unfinished & you have to explain the film for your self. It have a very good message & that is This film  makes you think. Think hard of all the human interior feelings.,959299200,4,273,3.875
1026132,4,6305403368,"I saw this movie months ago and thought it was incredible.  I then read Tim O'Brien's short story ""Sweatheart of the Song Tra Bong"" and realized how well the director and actors preserved the author's own words.  I was impressed and intrigued at the same time.  For those of you who were  wondering where to find this short story, check out The Things They Carried  by O'Brien....you'll be even more impressed with the movie!",956275200,23,425,4.6891891891891895
1026133,5,6305403368,"This one of the better movies I've seen in a long time.  It's not what you expect from a war movie at all.  It has everything it, action, drama & a love story all wrapped into one. Truly a great movie.  You must see it.",954547200,,219,3.8222222222222224
1026134,4,6305403368,"I enjoyed this surprising, unusual film.  Not at all what I expected to see happen to a woman who goes to Viet Nam to move in with her boyfriend during the war.  The ""greenies"" were intriguing!",940204800,4,193,4.333333333333333
1026135,5,6305403368,"I once lost a love, my first love, I loved her with all my strength, with all my heart and mind... Since her, I never felt anything for anyone, because of the fear of being hurt once more. This movie made me feel again  the powerful feelings, emotions that I felt for her and when I lost her, it  made me cry, it made me see that love is what really matters. Even if it  means that you could lost the love one. To those of you that lost a love,  you really have to see this movie, it will make you see that love is the  most powerful feeling someone can feel. With love you can take anything,  you can beat anything, you are the strongest. Without it, well you are just  one soul among others. Let me just say that the movie ends and I stood  quiet, understanding the depth of the feelings that the movie released. One  of the best movies that I ever saw. Brilliant.",925862400,10,866,4.076923076923077

7889160,5,6305403368,"Used this movie to compliment the book ""The Things They Carried"" by Tim O'Brien in my high school English class. It was fun to watch the transformation of opinions about MaryAnne. Enjoyed the movie.",1396483200,,198,4.852941176470588
7889161,5,6305403368,"Tis movie was directly tied to a specific chapter in the novel by Tim O'Brien, The Things They Carried.  I recall viewing it after chapter 20.  The students enjoyed its direct correlation to the book and it cemented their learning quite well.",1365292800,,242,4.738095238095238
7889162,3,6305403368,"The movie might seem on the surface to be silly and unrealistic and if you did not read the original work, The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien, it is quite possible to dismiss this as nonsensical fluff from an anti-Vietnam soldier perspective. Tim O'Brien was in Vietnam. The whole book needs to be read to understand the story (""The Sweetheart of Song Tra Bong"") and that might be the problem in trying to present only part of the novel in a TV movie.

O' Brien (the narrator in the book) tells the readers later in the novel that the story is probably the most realistic of all those in the book. Maybe ""Mary Anne"" or the girl next door didn't really show up in Nam, but innocent, impressionable kids did go to Nam and did develop a killer's eye and instincts.

The story is a metaphor for those young men who went to Vietnam with no real understanding of the war or the mechanics of fighting and were turned into killing machines as a means to survive the madness there. Some literally became machines, but of course, not all did. The majority of soldiers put in their time and tried to find a sense of normalcy, but O'Brien's story points out that even the purest of people could be damned by the war.",1254441600,7,1208,4.388392857142857
7889163,4,6305403368,"In ""The Things They Carried"", Tim O'Brien combines images from his personal experiences with thoughtful storytelling in order to capture the reader's imagination and take them into a world which they may never otherwise see. A world created out of the chaos and confusion that exists as a result of war and internal emotional conflicts. He calls it a work of fiction.

 As a war veteran I can appreciate the struggle of how challenging it is to tell a true war story. To bring back its character and relive it. Not merely to verbalize it, but to actually illustrate the story with words. An observer will never truly understand the moral, the underlying points, or even the emotional effects, unless they have lived it. You could tell someone a million different stories about how the dead  look, what they smell like, what they sound like, what goes through your mind when you see them and how everything you experience is interrelated. However, until you actually encounter these things for yourself, a story is never truly recounted except by those who were present. The personal history never receives its justice. This is, perhaps, why when we (veterans) tell these stories, we add in details that are not necessarily true, except that they are true and necessary, in order to bring back the realism that was once a part of their being. The best way that O'Brien relates to this aspect of personal history is in the chapter ""Good Form"". O'Brien describes why truth is manipulated. He says,  ""I want you to feel what I felt. I want you to know why story-truth is truer sometimes than happening truth""(pg. 203).

 It is for this reason that veterans rarely recount their stories. It is difficult to put into words the immense frustration that sets in when so much effort gets put into a story, and when it is finished, no one seems to appreciate it. People are always waiting for the ""moral"" or the ""point"" of the story. And sometimes there is not a point or a moral. More often than not things just happened. O'Brien relates to this very subject matter in the chapter ""How To Tell A True War Story,"" in which he states, ""A true war story is never moral. It does not instruct, nor encourage virtue, nor suggest models of proper human behavior, nor restrain men from doing the things men have always done. If a story seems moral, do not believe it"" (pg. 76). Furthermore he goes on to say that, ""If at the end of a war story you feel uplifted, or if you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste, then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie. There is no rectitude whatsoever. There is no virtue. As a first rule of thumb, therefore, you can tell a true war story by its absolute and uncompromising allegiance to obscenity and evil.""

 Sometimes it may be easier just to say that a story or a book is fiction. Doing this allows the author to escape from the bonds of reality. It opens up the freedom to change the details and manipulate the story in order to give a proper account that will do more justice to the memories than one that is nonfiction, one that lacks the color necessary to paint a picture in someone else mind. One that is as vivid as the one that exists in the mind of the storyteller. This changing of the facts is again recounted by O'Brien in chapter seven of his work. In it he recounts how Mitchell Sanders was telling the story of the patrol that went up into the mountains, and how they had heard sounds and how he had added in more details that were not true in order to bring the story to life. O'Brien recounts, ""In many cases a true war story cannot be believed. If you believe it, be skeptical. It's a question of credibility. Often the crazy stuff is true and the normal stuff isn't, because the normal stuff is necessary to make you believe the truly incredible craziness"" (pg. 79).

 Chapters like ""Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong"" may contain some fact. The whole chapter could be real. However to me it is more of story within a story. It explains that there is a certain innocence that is lost when someone becomes a part of the thing we call war. Something from which you can never go back. I believe to some extent, that this was the truer meaning of O'Brien's story of the Mary Anne character. Perhaps it is both a reflection of how war stories are more true than we admit to believing, but more so it is a reflection of how someone who seems so innocent and naive can travel to a place that seems to strip them of all that they once were. This is what war does to a person. It is an emotional scar that never truly heals. And so you are never the same person walking out that you were coming in. We may deny this, but in the end the person that goes over there dies, and the one that returns is nothing but a replacement.

 O'Brien has taken his own experience's and added in some details that are appropriate in order to tell a story closer to the heart than a simple account of the past. At times he strips these stories down to the bare essentials, and at other times he fabricates nearly all of the detail. Yet perhaps this is crucial to the storytelling process. Perhaps as O'Brien says, the ""story truth is truer sometimes than the happening truth."" If that is so, then here you have an example of a story-truth that leaves us wondering about one mans experience's in the jungles of Vietnam.

  This movie is based on a story-truth. It is not really meant to be a true, factual account. It is meant to make you think.",1139184000,11,5522,4.437314906219151
7889164,1,6305403368,"Mary Jane from the block kmeeping up with Green Berets?  Yeah right.  Hollywood shows itself detached from all reality!

This is just more propaganda by people who've never served in the military to push for women in combat roles- a singularly bad idea.

I was in Viet Nam and there is no way that this could have happened. Why is it Hollywood has to be so down on Viet Nam in general and Viet Nam vets in particular? I was very disappointed in this movie. 'Dear America' is more realistic about what we experienced. For an accurate 'war story', I would encourage people to see Mel Gibson's far better , as well as realistic, 'We Were Soldiers'.",1085097600,9,546,4.362745098039215

I'm glad I recorded it too, because this was one of the most heart-felt Vietnam stories I've ever seen and read. Almost as stunning as ""Apocalypse Now"" but not nearly as disturbing. The casting was perfect for every single role. I thought Kiefer Sutherland was the best of all of them.
