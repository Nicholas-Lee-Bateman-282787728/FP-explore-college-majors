1653381,5,B00005R251,"I have over 100 exercise dvds and videos and this is a great addition. I like that you can blend and choose workouts. I'm not very flexible and the yoga portions are doable-in the past I've stayed away from yoga but this has changed my mind. The pilates lower body work is great you can really feel it-being an ace trained instructor I do know that form is essential and both the pilates and yoga instructors give lots of tips and pay attention to their form which is great, overall a quick and effective workout!",1054684800,10,513,4.410526315789474
1653382,4,B00005R251,"I really enjoy the QuickFix concept; 10 minute segments that you can mix and match as you like.  The chaptering on this DVD is very good, and the workouts varied.  The DVD is divided into two sections, with four workouts each of Pilates and Yoga.  The subsections are:  Pilates abs, legs, total body, and Challenge; Yoga for energy, flexibility, strength, and Challenge.
The instruction is pretty solid.  The Pilates instruction for the abs, legs, and total body sections is good (not great), and with the challenge workout you have less of the pause-explain-workout-rinse-repeat that you have in the other three segments.  I find that the first three Yoga segments -- which are really just repeated sun salutations -- have way too much explanation, but the challenge workout flows better.  None of the Yoga workouts are a real ""workout"" for me so I use them as warm-ups and cool-downs for longer workout sessions, or to relax at the end of the day.  If you want a really great stretch or want to break a sweat, reach for Rodney Yee or Brian Kest.
One thing that niggles me is that the Yoga instructor seems awfully ...  She has a pseudo accent of some sort that comes and goes, and she doesn't seem very comfortable in front of the camera.  If you can get past that, though, the Yoga segments are nice, if mild.
Overall, this DVD is a nice addition to a workout library.  It doesn't stand alone as a primary workout DVD, but it is what it advertises:  a quick fix of exercise for when you need it.",1032652800,46,1498,4.569288389513108
1653383,5,B00005R251,"As a person new to Pilates and Yoga, I have thoroughly enjoyed this DVD.  I love being able to customize my workout, and the instruction is clear and concise.  I also see how this DVD will be useful as I progress physically.",1027987200,6,224,4.309523809523809
1653384,5,B00005R251,"This is my first exercise DVD and I'm hooked now!  I've been doing betweent 1-4 of the 10 minute workouts daily for 3 weeks now, and I feel great!  No jerky movements, no muscle stress, just toning and sculpting.  No pain, but immense gain!",1023321600,7,240,4.409090909090909
1653385,5,B00005R251,"I really love Pilates, but my Ana Caban video was getting a little stale and I was getting tired of fast-forwarding through all the intro and how-to stuff to get to the real exercises.
This DVD is great fun--you can select from 1 to 3 workouts in any combination of Yoga and Pilates. I love the fact that you can choose your own intensity: relax and stretch, or really challenge your body, depending on how much energy you have that day and what you want from your workout at the time. If you've only got 10 minutes, you can get in a good workout, and if you've got 30, even better. I enjoy that flexibility; it really helps me fit in a workout no matter how busy my day might be.
The biggest challenge for me is keeping my workouts interesting, getting enough variety to keep doing it day after day, week after week (While Pilates is the quickest ""quick fix"" I've found, you still have to keep at it to see results). This DVD allows me to mix and match and do something new every day. It definitely helps keep me on track.
The only small nitpick I have is that the Pilates segments don't seem to have enough introductory material to make this DVD good for absolute Pilates beginners. Pilates is pretty intense on certain body parts, and without knowing the right way to breathe, position your body, and move your muscles, I imagine you can really hurt yourself.  I'd definitely recommend Ana Caban's Beginning Matwork to give a foundation of proper form and focus for Pilates, and then go on to this DVD to keep your workout varied and interesting enough to become a habit.",1023148800,42,1574,4.465277777777778
1653386,5,B00005R251,"I am already a huge fan of the Quick Fix series, having had great results with the buns, abs, arms, and total body versions.  The 10-minute workout format is very flexible; you can do one session for a quick fix, or go longer for more benefits.
I was definitely not disappointed in this combo!  The Pilates instructor is very informative and keeps it simple, and the exercises kick!  but you never feel too stressed out.  I have done 3 of the sessions in a row (total of 30 minutes), and the time flies by.  Refreshing!
I haven't done all of the Yoga sessions, but they seem quite rigorous: relaxing, yes, but toning, definitely.
Huge fan of this series; would recommend in a heart-beat! So glad I found it; really fits a busy lifestyle.",1018828800,24,737,4.511278195488722
7951824,5,B00005R251,love these workouts so much i bought them for friends,1478044800,,53,4.4
7951825,5,B00005R251,"I have always loved the quickfix workouts, i have been doing the power yoga for years and still thoroughly enjoy it. Im really happy with the total mix dvd, it has an amazing relaxing yoga segment which i think beginners would be able to do relatively easily. The pilates is very ab orientated! i have a pretty strong core from yoga but in the first week doing the pilates i found it pretty challenging! however im sure after a few weeks i will be stronger. Its great that you can choose 3 different workouts from both yoga and pilates to mix them up so you don't get too bored. Overall im very happy with this dvd! As far as the quickfix dvds are concerned, i find them really great as you can see a 10 minute clock countdown, and it seems to go really quickly, then you do 3x 10 min workouts and before you know it youve done 30mins! so if you find exercise hard i think they would be great for you.",1359849600,,901,4.183908045977011
7951826,4,B00005R251,"This is a great start for someone like me who just wants to workout and needs the freedom and flexibility of breaking up the routine with the ""mix it up"" option this DVD offers.  There are several 10 minute segments and you can choose up to 3 to do at one time.  I personally like that they introduce the benefits of the postures,breathing and balance of yoga without mixing in the eastern religion often associated with this exercise form.",1239580800,,440,4.556962025316456
7951827,3,B00005R251,"but this DVD isn't one of my favorites of theirs!  I think Tracy (who leads the Pilates segments is terrific, but I didn't care for Suzanne in the Yoga portions of the workout.  Suzanne doesn't seem to be comfortable or natural in front of the camera.  Now, I'm wondering which Yoga Zone DVD she leads, for comparison.  While the exercises are good from all eight routines, if someone else were to lead the yoga, I might actually use this DVD more often.

I think a certain amount of instruction is necessary in a mass-marketed product (that's going to be geared toward a beginner audience) but because of time constraints you can't have too much explanation or set up time.  Therefore, it's better if the user of this DVD (or some of the 10 minute solution DVDs) have a basic pilates and yoga knowledge.

For a change in my routine, I'm glad I have the short pilates portions to add some variety.  But, for yoga I'll devote my time with another choice, like Barbara Benagh's ""Yoga for Beginners"" or ""Yoga for Stress Relief"" workouts.  Both DVDs have customized menu options and short practices of various routines for when you don't have the time for long yoga sessions!",1189468800,,1171,4.645631067961165
7951828,2,B00005R251,"If you've purchased workouts by Keli Roberts and you like her, stick to her.

The instructors on this DVD spend soooo much time instructing you to do things like 'lie down on your back"" you'll fall asleep lying there waiting for the exercise to begin.

I'd like to say I will use this DVD again, but in the 10 minutes it will take me to purchase something better, I'm moving on.",1154044800,2,378,4.309859154929577
7951829,5,B00005R251,"Quick Fix total mix is a versatile program that contains four ten minute Pilates and four ten minute Yoga routines.

You can mix and match between all the various sequences via a matrix feature which lets you program 3 sequences of your choice in a row. It's very easy to use and makes it so that you don't have to keep messing around with the remote once you decide on the order you want to practice at any given time.

I wouldn't recommend this for stone beginners in either Pilates or Yoga. I would suggest getting something like Stott Pilates Basics to learn the fundamentals of Pilates. I would recommend something like Yoga Zones Basics for Beginners (which contains 2 twenty minute routines) to learn some fundamentals of Yoga.

Once you have a basic background in both Pilates and Yoga I think this Quick fix DVD is a great tool to be able to use in order to have a lot of variety in your practice while fitting it into a short amount of time. You can determine the emphasis you want. For example, I always do two Pilates, I always start with the Abs and then select one of the other Pilates routines and end with one Yoga routine as a nice finish. That's my personal preference but of course you have the option to do whatever you prefer. You can do all Pilates or all Yoga as well.

Anyway, this program is very well done, both the Pilates and the Yoga instructor (who actually appears in a few Yoga Zone Videos, she is a Yoga Zone Senior teacher) do a great job leading through the practices along with two students. One of the student's is always a modifier showing a less intense version of the various poses.

Another program I enjoy that's set up in a similar way (though only pilates) is Liz Gillies Progressive Pilates. It's a wonderful program with ten minute sequences as well. It doesn't have the matrix, but you can easily select the order you want via the remote. It's slightly less convenient but so well done in terms of instruction (she builds all the routines incrementally to warm you up into each movement) that it's worth the miniscule amount of effort required to use it.

 If you have 30 minutes available to practice and you're ready to move into the next level of Pilates, then I'd highly recommend Hilary Burnett's Intermediate Pilates program. It covers the complete Pilates intermediate series plus includes poses from the advanced series as well. It's beautifully done, has a great flow and Hilary Burnett is an amazing instructor!",1142294400,2,2468,4.595454545454546
7951830,1,B00005R251,"I have most of the rest of the quick fix series and I love them. This one is horrible. The Pilates person spends about 8 minutes explaining and about 2 minutes doing, and the exercises weren't that great... The Yoga person tries to talk in this soothing voice, but it just comes out stilted and weird. The exercises are OK. Both instructors use a lot of weird, descriptive terminology (like ""lower your body down on to your sit-bones"", translated ""sit on your butt""). Overall, you can do better than this DVD.",1136332800,3,509,4.604395604395604
7951831,5,B00005R251,"I'm a long-time (10 years plus) gym member and aerobics class participant, so I'm very skeptical when it comes to at-home workout tapes/dvds. I bought this DVD after a taste of a Yoga/Pilates class at my gym to see what else is out there, something I could fit into my busy schedule when I'm not able to make it to aerobics classes.  I ABSOLUTELY ENJOY IT!  I like the flexibility and variety of being able to choose a mix from 8 different 10-minute routines with a few clicks of the DVD remote.  It has the option to mix-and-match or to select just the Yoga routines or just the Pilates routines.  If my schedule allows only for a quick workout, it's easy to select just one 10-minute routine if I choose.  The instructors aren't cheesie; they are precise with describing and illustrating each movement, providing alternatives for each move to allow people at different fitness levels and body types to follow along.  The instructors are encouraging without being ridiculous and insincere.  The workouts are challenging.  Simply terrific!  I would definitely buy Total Mix:  Yoga and Pilates PART TWO if it is ever released.",1068336000,15,1125,4.8125
7951832,2,B00005R251,"This DVD will not give you a good workout.  It seems that the instructors spend too much time explaining everything, and not enough time actually doing the workouts.",1062979200,5,165,4.892857142857143
