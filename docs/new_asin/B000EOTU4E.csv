8112017,5,B000EOTU4E,Only for the most hardcore of Goemon fans it's kinda corny and episodes have basically the same plot but it's still entertaining,1470614400,,128,4.863636363636363
8112018,4,B000EOTU4E,"One disc in, but I am liking this so far. Everything a fan of the Goemon games would expect. Funny, random, quirky but most importantly entertaining!",1467763200,,149,4.769230769230769
8112019,3,B000EOTU4E,it was a okay series but the ending could have been better,1455580800,,58,3.9166666666666665
8112020,5,B000EOTU4E,"I wasn't sure what I was getting in to when I purchased this, but I wasn't disappointed with the result.

Simply put, I can recommend this to anyone who enjoys generic anime silliness, and most who enjoy the Goemon (or Mystical Ninja) series from Konami.

If you're looking for a deep story and thought-provoking displays of art....this isn't for you, sorry. But if you're into generic stuff based loosely on a game series, then this IS for you!",1402704000,3,445,4.6923076923076925
