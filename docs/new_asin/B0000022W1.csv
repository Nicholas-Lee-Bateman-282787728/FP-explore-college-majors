1176311,2,B0000022W1,"This made-for-movie was highly anticipated, but turned out to be a disappointment. While it was great to have a new Herbie movie, the storyline stunk. There were too many liberties taken i.e. the origin of  Herbie's name. Bruce Campbell was good, and of course Dean Jones was great,  but Alexendra Wentworth was absolutely terrible! If you're a Herbie fan,  wait until the price drops....",961891200,5,388,5.03125
1176312,5,B0000022W1,"My six-year-old enjoyed watching Herbie run around and do things without a driver that ""real"" cars can't do with a driver.  There was enough action and laughs to keep her entertained through out the entire 108  minutes.  Dean Jones and Michelle Lee work so well together.  The comedy is  suitable for all ages.",939772800,25,310,4.773584905660377

1176316,5,B0000022W1,"I have always loved Herbie as a kid and still so now. Perhaps this particular movie isn't as crash hot as all the others and also they don't play the original Herbie theme but it's still a good film so why the hell is this not on DVD. It's a great film for kids to watch as well compared to some so called ""suitable"" programming for youngsters these days.",1504051200,,355,4.159420289855072

1176320,4,B0000022W1,"I had a hard time convincing my husband that this was a worthwhile movie. I had seen it many times as a kid and had recommended our family watch it together. ""A self aware car? Sounds lame but we have nothing better to do tonight."" The movie delivered lots of laughs and, being older now, l was able to appreciate the dialog and Tennessee's cookiness a lot more. In the end he admitted l had made a good recommendation. My three and five year olds did find it to be a bit boring, after all it was before the days of good special effects, there are absolutely no children in the entire movie, and most of the humor is in dialog that goes over their heads. But older kids and adults certainly will enjoy it.",1489536000,,705,4.229629629629629

1176345,4,B0000022W1,"Well I loved this movie, but at times my young grandchildren, ages 5-9 were bored and lost some interest.  Guess they are all used to virtual realities anymore.  This movie is clean cut, funny and very creative for 'back then.'  Overall a good motivational, yet fictional, movie.
I was surprised also in that it seemed at times I actually had to explain what was going on and what some of the comments meant or were referring to.  I do get involved with watching and explaining when I see some puzzled looks.
For instance, the demolition derby in the beginning, completely went over their heads.  They had no idea what it was or why.  And the various 'colorful' characters had to be better explained.  Like the helper who acted so 'dumb,' but was smart enough to know about Herbie first.  Things like that.

1176420,5,B0000022W1,"I'm not gonna say much about the movie except that I think it's a great film and I always enjoy watching it. I will instead try to shed a little more light on some of the bonus features included.
DISC 1:
AUDIO COMMENTARY
Many people skip the audio commentary and rarely listen to it, however I found it rather interesting. Dean Jones, Buddy Hackett, and Michele Lee all include their commentary on this film. Buddy Hackett cracks jokes throughout the commentary and he and Dean share several behind-the-scenes stories. Michele Lee was not as interesting to me, because she talked a lot about her hair, clothes, and makeup. She does however share a few behind-the-scenes stories including how she missed her uncle's funeral to be at work. (Her choice by the way.)
SUSIE- THE LITTLE BLUE COUPE
A delightful little cartoon narrarated by actor Sterling Holloway (perhaps best known as the voice of Winnie the Pooh on the Walt Disney classic The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh) about the life of a car.

DISC 2:
THAT LOVEABLE BUG
This is my favorite bonus feature on the disc. It is the HERBIE documentary which includes interviews with Buddy Hackett, Dean Jones, Michele Lee and several crew members. It answers questions like, ""Where did HERBIE get his name?"", ""Why 53"", ""How were some of the stunts accomplished?"", and many more. I definitely suggest you watch this one if not any of the others.
THE MANY LIVES OF HERBIE
A very small documentary on the different HERBIE movies. Some highlights include an interview with Don Knotts and information on where some of the original Herbie cars are now.
HERBIE MANIA
A talk about all things Herbie, including some things that have happened because of the movie.
BEHIND THE SCENES PROMO
An interesting promotion of the film featuring scenes with Dean Jones, Michele Lee, and of course, Herbie.

During 1969 a contest was held to see who could have the best dressed bug. The winner was presented with a brand new bug by Dean Jones. It's very interesting to see everybody's bug all decked out. One was a tank, one was a mouse, and that's just two of the thirty some odd cars decorated to win first prize. Very neat footage there.
THE MAN WHO GAVE HERBIE HIS VOICE
This is about the sound manager at Disney Studios at the time and how certain sound effects were created before the use of the sound board. It's really very interesting and informative.
DELETED SCENES
No explanation needed here, though I must say they're rather short scenes and unfortunately there is no actual footage of the deleted scenes.
THEATRICAL TRAILER
RADIO SPOTS
I have not listened to these, but I bet that they're interesting.

David Tomlinson is both hilarious and menacing as the villian, and Dean Jones is reliably heroic, even as he plays a slightly pompous character (he thinks he's winning all the races, not Herbie.) I suppose there is a lesson for kids in that, though I wouldn't put up the female lead as anything to emulate...though she does have some spunk.

It brings back so many fond memories - which is odd on its face because I don't recall seeing it at all until just a few days ago. (I was just about 4 years old when it came out.) Amongst other things it reminded me just how much fun it would be to own an appropriately-painted Volkswagen Beetle! (This won't spoil anything, but Joe E. Ross as a police detective made for a terribly funny scene. It's kind of an ""inside joke"" I think, but look up an episode of ""Car 54, Where Are You?"" and you'll get it!)

1176475,4,B0000022W1,"""I may be kidding myself, but I think I can make something out of that sad little bucket of bolts.""

I always thought of Herbie as a big puppy.
For me, the best part of this film is the goofy charm of Buddy Hackett's character Tennessee Steinmetz, who believes Herbie is more than just an inanimate object.  He can't resist making many references to his time with the Buddhist monks in Tibet, where he learned spiritual enlightenment.  He realizes and appreciates Herbie's potential at the outset.  He takes much longer for the egotistical washed up race car driver (Dean Jones) to come to the same understanding; more's the pity.  Naturally, a romance is also tossed into the mix, plus lots of racing footage, and a typical arch villain (David Tomlinson) who giggles like a crazed idiot when he isn't bellowing threats and seeking to do bodily harm to both humans and car alike with the help of his dimwitted sidekick Havershaw (Joe Flynn).  ""You're a rat after my own heart Havershaw.""

It's 1969 in San Francisco, and Jim Douglas (Dean Jones), once a stock-car racer of some note, has hit a patch of bad luck: after a couple of messy crackups in as many years, all he can get is jobs in demolition derby--and even then his manager thinks he's ""too old"" to be competing against kids of 18 and 19.  His roommate, junk sculptor Tennessee Steinmetz (Buddy Hackett), suggests he might be able to get work as a mechanic in one of the big auto agencies down on Van Nuys Avenue, and while Jim would much rather drive cars than fix them, he decides to give it a try.  At an import-auto agency owned by stuffy Britisher Peter Thorndyke (David Tomlinson), who's an amateur racer himself, he meets Carole Bennett (Michele Lee), also a race fan and a pretty fair country mechanic on her own account--and is picked out by a little white Volkswagen that literally follows him home.  Forced into buying the little car, he quickly discovers that it has its own ideas about where it will go and when--and an amazing turn of speed.  Tennessee suspects it's an example of ""a new kind of intelligence"" and christens it Herbie.  Jim, for his part, sees it as his chance to rekindle his fading career--and thanks to a rivalry with Thorndyke (whom Herbie also hates), he turns out to be right, as the wins pile up and his name appears on the front page of the sports section once again.  It takes Jim a long time to admit that there's more to Herbie than just nuts and bolts, and he almost loses the car when the despairing Herbie literally ""runs away from home"" and severely damages a Chinese grocery store.  But the mishap gains Jim a new backer, Tang Wu (Benson Fong), a local business tycoon and passionate racing buff, and with Tennessee and Carole to help, he and Herbie set out to win the big El Dorado road race and best Thorndyke once and for all.

There's a lot of rather obvious blue-screen work in this movie, but Herbie himself is a real character and most of his SFX are quite well done for the time.  And at bottom this is really a story about faith, about never giving up, and about how treachery will always out and the good guys (if they stick it out) will always win in the end.",1350691200,,2327,4.41588785046729

Herbie (the car) is lovable from the start, we all want him to win and be loved by his owner. The charm of the cute little car can't completely make up for the film's many flaws though. The production seems very cheap, and suffers from all the cheap tricks used in film-making at the time. Only the acting of Buddy Hackett stands out as being good, whereas Dean Jones' is truly quite bad. It is completely unrealistic that Jones' character Jim doesn't realize his skills aren't winning the races, and that a Beetle can't go much faster than more powerful cars.

I think it's also worth pointing out that the film isn't suitable for toddlers or young children because of the suicide scene, many insults between characters, and the violent intent of the villain.",1298332800,6,803,4.728571428571429

Dean Jones and Ken Berry were perfect as the leads for both movies.
So if you want a feel good pick me up, just pop in The Love Bug or Herbie Rides Again and kiss the blues goodbye.
Oh by the way, it has a terrific catchy soundtrack score too, you've only got to hear it to know Herbie is on the tv.
There were also a few Superbug films made in the 70's to try and cash in on the Love Bug craze, but they are not a patch on Herbie.",1280880000,,596,3.776
1176525,5,B0000022W1,"Herbie chooses Jim Douglas as his owner early on in this classic Disney film--but it takes Jim a bit longer to realize just what Herbie means to him. While the film centers around Jim Douglas' racing career, the underlying message is that we all need to feel loved, protected and valued for who we are.

That may sound a bit lofty, but Walt Disney was a master at taking simple, and more importantly, worthwhile messages and communicating them in a fun, family-friendly way. I, myself, made the mistake of remembering Herbie as just a zany kid's movie. But as I watched it with my four year-old, I was reminded that Mr. Disney made his films for the whole family to enjoy together and there was always something for the children and the adults to take away from the movie. The kids will have fun watching Herbie's journey to become a winning race car and adults will enjoy Jim's journey in learning there's more to life than being a race car driver.

Dean Jones does a superb job handling the humor and the drama in Herbie. And, of course, Buddy Hackett offers up some very funny lines, but he also handles the more dramatic moments with believability. Michele Lee, David Tomlinson and Benson Fong also do a great job of making the movie so delightful.

In response to another reviewer's concern about some of the language (stupid, idiot) that takes place--I could've lived without it, too--but we watch the movie with our son so that it can be discussed as needed. And Mr. Thorndyke does his fair share of yelling and belittling of others, but it's effectively used to distinguish him as the bad guy. In my opinion, this is a case where the few negatives are far outweighed by the positives.

We learned from watching some of the great extras on the dvd that a Volkswagen Beetle was not the automatic choice for Herbie. Several cars were selected and parked on the backlot of Disney studios. Then they were observed to see which car elicited the most response from people passing by. Overwhelmingly, folks seemed to respond to the little bug. We did, too. Fun and silly moments are measured with honest and poignant ones making this film truly lovable. Enjoy!",1271635200,2,2160,4.661417322834645

I really regret not watching it before now, because it is a classic. While the three sequels may not be classics, there's a reason why a movie like this has three sequels to begin with!

This is a perfect blend of Disney stars, with Dean Jones and Buddy Hackett highlighting the picture (along with Herbie of course). While these guys may not be confused with Laurence Olivier or Jimmy Stewart, they play a Disney part to perfection. Michele Lee is cute in her role (although that 60's hair leaves something to be desired) and David Tomlinson makes a ""good"" bad guy.

The antics in this film are quite hilarious at times. Admittedly, most of the laugh out loud parts are drawn from Herbie's antics, so that speaks to the Disney geniuses as much as it does to the acting of the stars. Hackett also draws a good portion of laughs, though--understandably when you take a look at that face!

All in all, this is a Disney film that belongs in the same discussion as ""The Shaggy Dog"" and ""The Absent-Minded Professor."" Completely clean entertainment for  the whole family!",1209081600,,1206,4.569444444444445

1176537,5,B0000022W1,"Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) is an aging race car driver who hasn't had much luck in recent years.  He keeps wrecking cars and loosing sponsors.  Walking by the show room of a specialized dealership, he notices the beautiful secretary, Carole Bennett (Michele Lee) hanging a sign and decides to go inside and flirt a little.  Their conversation is interrupted at first by Ms. Bennett's boss, Mr. Peter Thorndyke (David Tomlinson) and then by a little Volkswagen Beetle deluxe ragtop sedan.  Mr. Thorndyke verbally abuses the little car, but Jim sticks up for it.  Unbeknownst to everyone, the little car has a head and heart of its own and follows Jim home.  His partner and mechanic, Tennessee Steinmetz (Buddy Hackett) immediately falls in love with the car and names him Herbie (in real life the screenwriters took the name Herbie from one of Hackett's comedy routines so it was right that he bestowed the name Herbie upon the car).  Jim soon discovers that Herbie isn't like a typically car and eventually enters some races with Herbie and starts winning again.  Things start looking up, but Jim's pride and vanity get in the way and threaten to ruin everything, including his racing career and his budding romance with Carole.

I never saw THE LOVE BUG when it was first released in theatres.  I wasn't even born, yet.  I do know that at an early age in an era before cable and VCRs my brother and I happened to see the Herbie movies and fell in love with the cute little car.  THE LOVE BUG was made at a very interesting time, both at Walt Disney and the world at large.  Originally released in 1969, the film became the highest grossing movie of that year.  Walt himself had died just a few years before and there were many at the time who questioned whether the studio would be able to survive intact.  THE LOVE BUG was one of those films that seemed to show the world that even though the founder and creator was dead, his dream would go on.  The film represents everything good that Walt Disney tried to portray in all of his movies.  For example, that the best things in life don't necessarily come in the biggest and brightest packages, that even though life is difficult you shouldn't give up hope, and that love is a very powerful force of good.  It's not hard to see why people flocked to the movie.  Just a year before Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy had been assassinated and Chicago erupted in a riot at the Democratic National Convention.  People were tired of seeing dark and dreary things.  Went they went to the movies they didn't just want to escape.  They wanted to be told stories that filled them light, hope, and love.

In the post-modern era we have inherited and are continuing to build, pictures like THE LOVE BUG can be overlooked and thrown to the side for being too innocent.  As a whole, we've become much more jaded and cynical and that's not really a good thing.

I like THE LOVE BUG because of those things and I wish filmmakers would make more pictures like it now and again.  The world's a dark enough place already.  It'd be nice to watch a light-hearted family comedy now and again that wasn't just escapist fare, but reminded us of the best things in life.

Film-buffs should see THE LOVE BUG for a variety of reasons.  Besides being the #1 grossing film of 1969 the film is notable for its contribution to the film industry in special effects.  THE LOVE BUG was created in an era were there was no such thing as CGI.  All of the special effects in THE LOVE BUG were done the old fashioned way and it is amazing how well done they are.  These effects might seem old and outdated by a child raised by computer-graphics, but in the era that the film was released the special effects are extraordinary.

THE LOVE BUG Special Edition is a great DVD to own, especially if you are fans of the film. There are two discs all total.  On the first disc, in addition to the usual commentary (in this case with Dean Jones, Michelle Lee, and Buddy Hackett), there is a short Disney cartoon entitled ""Susie--the Little Blue Coupe"".  This cartoon is a delight to watch and was in the inspiration for the characters in the Pixar film CARS.

The second disc is loaded with special features.  There are several featurettes including ""That Lovable Bug"", ""The Many Lives of Herbie"", ""Herbie Mania"", and ""Lost Treasures: Searching For Herbie"".  ""That Lovable Bug"" is my favorite of these featurettes. It's basically a documentary about the making of THE LOVE BUG, including interviews with Dean Jones, Michele Lee, and Buddy Hackett.  ""The Many Lives of Herbie"" is a run-through of how Herbie changed throughout the various films he has been a part (excluded is HERBIE FULLY LOADED which was released after this DVD was made).  ""Herbie Mania"" is basically a long interview with a couple of guys who own their own Herbie recreations, one that is complete with oil spills and doors that open automatically. ""Lost Treasures: Searching For Herbie"" is more or less a combination of information included in other special features that ends by showing where the first trick Herbie now resides.  A couple other extras I enjoyed were a ""Behind the Scenes"" promo that had been culled together from archived footage and ""Love Bug Day at Disneyland"" which is archived footage of the Love Bug Day that was held at Disneyland in 1969; it must have been incredibly difficult to choose a winning entry from all the cars that were there that day.  I also enjoyed ""The Man Who Gave Herbie His Voice"" which is a documentary tribute to Jimmy McDonald, the sound effect supervisor on THE LOVE BUG and countless other Disney films and shorts.  Other extras include the 1969 Disney Studio Album, production gallery, deleted scenes that were never shot, the theatrical trailer, radio spots, two sound studio exercises, production stills, a comic book, biographies of the film's main actors and director, publicity documents, and an excerpt from the screenplay.",1174176000,2,5968,4.6816874400767015
1176538,4,B0000022W1,"1968 was a great year for Dean Jones.  He starred in ""Blackbeard's Ghost,"" followed that up with ""The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit,"" and finished with a movie where he really shined, ""The Love Bug.""  Perhaps no one told Mr. Jones that the real star of this movie was a Volkswagen Beetle.

Jim Douglas (Jones) is a race car driver.  Unfortunately, he is a washed up race car driver who has a hard time recognizing that he is washed up.  Jim's life changes when he wanders into a car showroom that caters to foreign luxury cars, just after seeing a pair of beautiful legs belonging to Carole Bennett (Michele Lee, who has been a fixture on television for decades, including a regular role on ""Knott's Landing"").

Jim wanders around the showroom looking at cars that he is unable to afford when a Beetle nuzzles his leg.  Peter Thorndyke (David Tomlinson, perhaps best known as Mr. Banks in ""Mary Poppins"" and Mr. Emelius Browne in ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"") is anxious to get rid of the little car and makes Jim a deal he is unable to refuse.

At first, it seems as though the little car is just one more in a series of disasters in Jim's life.  However, Jim's friend Tennessee Steinmetz (Buddy Hackett, ""The Music Man,"" ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""The Little Mermaid II"") quickly recognizes there is something special about the little car.  Jim begins winning races with the little car, which Tennessee names after a relative.  Unfortunately for Jim, some of the races he wins are against Peter Thorndyke, who decides he wants the car back.

The climax of the movie is a race through the mountains and deserts of the West as Herbie the Love Bug races his heart out trying to save Jim and himself.

Disney specializes in movies about lovable characters, and Disney hit gold with ""The Love Bug.""  Disney's special effects team gave Herbie a lot of character.  Herbie is like an intelligent and lovable dog with wheels and enough horsepower to pop wheelies.  The choices of Buddy Hackett and of Michele Lee were brilliant because they were so natural in their roles.  Even Dean Jones was a good pick for this movie.

The comedy in this movie ranges from subtle humor to outrageous slapstick.  Most of the comedy works.  This family movie is one of those rare movies that every member of the family will find amusing.

This edition of ""The Love Bug"" is the best edition available.  The movie has been restored and is in wide screen.  One of the extras is an audio commentary that includes the late Buddy Hackett.  This DVD also has a second disk that includes a cornucopia of information about the lovable little car.  This DVD is a requirement for fans of this movie.

1176539,5,B0000022W1,"I am so glad the Disney studios took the time to diversify their resume apart from animation, cute cuddly creatures, and musicals. They were honestly on a roll there almost more so with Haley Mills and Annette Funiciello at the helm. Dean Jones was another Disney favorite, aside from his Ugly Dachsund days, with this comedy classic that struck gold for the Disney Studios. This movie moves like it was made from the concrete that helps move the lively volkswagon. (Thank God, it didn't talk). It didn't have to, the bug had absolute body language like one's most favorite pet. The storyline does not waste a moment, and begins to the very end, or should I say, the finishing line. Everything in this movie works, and the suttle scenes where the confused love bug takes a quick jolt by bouncing off of things, or gets drunk from being fed irish coffee, is not just added comedy, but is an actual part of the story. Good work for the Disney clan of movie inventors, and great to see these products available on DVD.

There is very little chance any remake could even come close to the charm of the original. This ""Love Bug"" starring Bruce Campbell doesn't deliver as other reviewers have said, but I couldn't help enjoying the heck out of it.

1. I love Herbie and always will, in whatever vehicle he appears in (forgive the pun:)).

2. I love Bruce Campbell. This is definitely not his best performance, but there was more than enough of the Bruce I know and love to carry this film for me.

3. Dean Jones--I actually started to cry when he showed up.

1176545,5,B0000022W1,"Down-on-his-luck racecar driver Jim Douglas is desperate to make a comeback. In the meantime though, he just needs some cheap, honest transportation. While perusing the merchandise at a local, upscale dealership, Jim's interest in a friendly saleswoman and his immediate disliking for the stuffy proprietor bring him to the defense of a mistreated little Volkswagen bug. Jim is only interested in a powerful car though, and he returns to his rundown San Francisco firehouse without the knowledge that the little car is following him home. The next day, Jim finds himself trapped into purchasing the VW beetle, and only his housemate, eccentric artist and mechanic Tennessee Steinmetz, is happy about the deal. Tennessee is the first to recognize that there is something special in the little car; that it has a life and mind of its own. Scoffing at the concept, Jim tries to make the most of the situation but immediately has trouble controlling the bug. He attempts to return the car, to no avail, but he does get the chance to spend some quality time with Carole, the saleslady he was eyeing before. Jim also makes a discovery about the little car. It's fast. It's VERY fast! Suddenly, Jim is inspired to enter the car into the racing circuit, himself behind the wheel of course! Soon, Jim and Herbie (as Tennessee has dubbed the little VW bug), are tearing up the tracks, and Carole and her boss, Peter Thorndyke, take notice. While Herbie the car begins playing matchmaker to Jim and Carole, Thorndyke begins plotting to outdo the winning team on the racecourse.  More immediate trouble arises between Jim and Herbie though, when Jim continues to deny Herbie's sentience and not only takes credit for the car's ability to win races, but also attempts to trade up for a more powerful vehicle. Emotionally destroyed, Herbie attempts to drive himself off the Golden Gate Bridge, and only Jim's acceptance of the little car's magic and love saves the day! Their problems are not over yet though. When Herbie accidentally destroys a local Chinese businessman's roadside stand, Jim is too broke to pay for the damages. The businessman, Mr. Wu, takes possession of Herbie, and the only way Jim and his crew can get their little friend back is to beat Peter Thorndyke in one crazy and hilarious open-road race!

""The Love Bug"" is one of those films that perfectly exemplifies the term, ""Disney Magic."" What other studio could take a story about a car with a mind and heart of its own and turn it into the top-grossing film of 1969! Disney Legend Dean Jones was tailor-made for the role of Jim Douglas, the late Buddy Hackett was born to play lovable Tennessee Steinmetz, and Michelle Lee was the perfect leading-lady for this very unique film! And, who can forget the late, great David Tomlinson, another Disney Legend who added his perfect flair to all three Disney Masterpieces he co-starred in! David is an unforgettably bumbling villain in this charming family classic, with good ol' Joe Flynn cracking us up at his side! With yet another Disney Legend, Robert Stevenson, at the helm, Disney's traditional and glorious Peter Ellenshaw matte effects, wonderful music, fantastic stunts, terrific performances, and tons of magic and heart in the form of childlike Herbie the Volkswagen, it's easy to understand why ""The Love Bug"" became a major Disney classic that spawned five, yes, FIVE wonderful sequels and a short-lived television series! One of the sequels is a TV movie from 1997 that is repeatedly referred to as a remake, even by the Disney historian on this DVD's bonus disc, which is a pet peeve of mine, I must admit. People also constantly refer to the recent and wonderful Lindsay Lohan sequel as a remake, which just drives me nuts! Let it be known that I am a HUGE Herbie fan! I still dream of the day when I'll own and drive a replica of Herbie the Love Bug myself! I have a large remote-control Herbie, a Herbie beanie, all the DVDs, and other collectibles. I'm a big fan! That's one of the great things about this two-disc set! It's made for the fans! Among the extras is a featurette about hardcore Herbie fans who talk about how they made their own Herbies! We also get footage of the Love Bug Day at Disneyland, where fans decorated their own Volkswagens for a big parade and contest to win a Herbie of their own from Dean Jones! We get a featurette on the many lives of Herbie (unfortunately, all extra features were made before ""Herbie: Fully Loaded,"" but this disc is great about mentioning ALL the other Herbie films that came before it) and one of interviews with the stars, in addition to radio spots and sound studio features. There are also two deleted scenes represented by stills, art, and script pages, a featurette on the Disney sound effects master that worked on ""The Love Bug,"" plenty of art, document, merchandise, and photo galleries, a 1969 montage on what Disney was up to that year, a featurette on where Herbie can be found today, a screenplay excerpt with film comparison, and a fantastic behind-the-scenes promo starring Dean Jones and the rest of the ""Love Bug"" cast! All this can be found on Disc 2, but even Disc 1 has its extras! In addition to the glorious widescreen presentation of the film itself, Disc 1 of ""The Love Bug"" Special Edition  includes Disney's classic short, ""Suzie, the Little Blue Coupe,"" the story about a little car that, like Herbie, has a life of her own. Disc 1 also has feature commentary with none-other than Dean Jones and Buddy Hackett, and a separately recorded Michelle Lee commentary is spliced in! It's very enjoyable to watch, even if Buddy is more interested in discussing his fascinating experiences in show business outside of the Disney Studios (Dean Jones reigns him in when he can) and Michelle Lee is more focused on how ""cute"" she looked in `69.

For Herbie or Disney fanatics, this 2-disc set is a must own. In fact, the ""Herbie the Love Bug Collection"" 4-film boxed set is a must own! And, if you still can't get enough, pick up sequel number five, also titled ""The Love Bug,"" on VHS. It stars B-film fave Bruce Campbell and is the one source for Herbie's secret origin story! You may find it to be a hokey TV movie in comparison to the others, but it DOES include the tearful reunion of Jim Douglas (played, as always, by Dean Jones) and Herbie the Love Bug! You also MUST SEE ""Herbie: Fully Loaded,"" probably the second best film in the franchise (even if I've always LOVED ""Herbie Goes Bananas""). Enjoy them all, and let's hope we see the Dean Jones TV series and the Bruce Campbell film hit DVD format someday soon too!",1140566400,,6613,4.737847222222222

However that VW bug (Herbie) has become loved  as one of Disney's beloved (dare I say) Human characters. Other than Davy Crockett or Zorro, can you really name another?

The Classic Love Bug is pure Disney Magic. I feel it still had WALT DISNEY's imprint on it. It was done long after his death, but you feel Walt's magic touch. The DVD version is with its extra make this timeless classic worth seeing again and again, unlike its current remake Herbie Fully Loaded.

One of the greatest and smartest things on this DVD is the audio commentary track from actors Dean Jones, Michelle Lee and the late Buddy Hackett. The track gave you insight into the actors mind set and the movie itself. Sometimes it viers into more entertainment stories, like when Hackett reveals he was offered to become one of the three stooges after the original Curly died or Michelle Lee pointing out a film flub involving earings and the art of DISNEY kissing.

The other features are pure Disney magic for true film buffs, so I suggest don't show them when smaller kids are around, it will bore them to tears. Well maybe share the Love Bug sunday strips which ran in 1969.

1176554,5,B0000022W1,"With the release of ""Herbie: Fully Loaded"" coming out shortly, I think now would be a good time to revisit the film that began it all: the 1969 family classic ""The Love Bug"". Without a doubt the best live action movie Disney ever made, this film was for quite a while my favorite movie ever and still remains in my top five.

""The Love Bug"" tells the story o Dean Jones, a down on his luck racing driver who's broke and lives in a run down with his best friend Tennesse Steinmetz (the always hilarious Buddy Hackett). Once at the top of his game, Douglas is now a loser in ever sense of the word. Then one day, while shopping for a cheap car, he meets Carol Benett (Michelle Lee), a leggy, beautiful saleswoman who capture his heart. Then a small Volkswagen Beatled drives into his life (without the aid of a human driver), and Douglas's luck begins to change. Once he works out the many kinkds involving Herbie, he once again by a champion racer, much to the dismay of evil car salesman Peter Thorndyke (David Tomlinson), who will stop at nothing to make sure Douglas's reign will come to a bitter end.

This film encapsulizes verything that Disney is: warm, sweet and outright hilarious. It also has some amazing racing sequences that rank among the best ever shot. As for it not being animated, who cares?

The bonus dvd is loaded with goodies, including interviews with a ""Herbie"" historian, a makingof documentary, a look at ""Herbie"" and its sequels (inclduing a highly entertaining compare and contrast) as well as many other goodies that hardcore Herbie fans (I call them Herbie-vores) will delight in.

This is definitely a must have film. This is an essential dvd and high quality entertainment.",1119398400,9,1704,4.651162790697675
1176555,1,B0000022W1,"I would suggest staying with the original love bug and the sequals. As a hard core herbie fan I like to deny the existence of this movie. Not only was the story, writing, special effects, and acting poor on this, they couldn't even remember how to paint herbie. I could have told them how to paint herbie correctly when I was seven years old. Hopefully disney makes up for this with the release of herbie fully loaded and they lock this in the vault until the original master tapes decay into non-existence.",1104796800,,507,4.521739130434782
1176556,2,B0000022W1,"This film is pretty much only bearable if you're playing a Bruce Campbell drinking game or you're under the age of five.  The cheesiness factor of the previous Herbie flicks has been taken to the upteenth level, and several takes of the Bruce Campbell/Alexandra Wentworth dialogue are painful to watch as it appears that the performers were reading cue cards off camera.  The ""race"" looks like it has been filmed at twenty'five miles per hour, and the CGI has not aged particularly well.

But, that's the bad.

This film also has enough good in it to make it a fun romp for viewing once or twice:

-The 50's ""Frankenstein"" sequence is classic and stylish, nicely done and just silly enough.

-Horace (the evil black bug) is awesome.  I had a chance to poke under the hood of this car at a shop in Pasadena and let me tell you, it's one of the coolest bugs I've ever seen.  I can't imagine how they could have made a cute volkswagen even more evil-looking without chopping the top and performing an animal sacrifice in the trunk.

The scene in Chinatown is strangely out of focus, while the rest of the movie appears just fine. Did the engineer fall asleep while he was doing the transfer, or just what happened?

In spite of that, I will say that this is one Disney DVD you are PROBABLY safe in buying. Maybe it came out before they started cutting corners so severely.

Though the moive is rated G, it has a few things about it that I don't find appropriate for young children.
The dialogue is riddled with words like ""stupid"" and ""idiot,""-- words I prefer to keep out of my son's vocabulary, at least for now.
I also find the character, Mr. Thorndike, to have an anger management problem. In the majority of his scenes, he is yelling at the top of his lungs and calling his sidekick, Havershaw, a series of derogatory names-- definitely not a characteristic I want my son to emulate. Finally, while I appreciate the whole appeal of a car having human qualities, I find the scene where Herbie tries to commit suicide a bit much for a kid's movie. Having to explain what the car was doing was difficult.
Overall, though the movie has cute qualities, I wish that the attributes I mentioned were not included. Call me a protective parent but seems to me that today's kids are considered rude because they are exposed to media like this that are considered acceptable.

The story for those that don't know is of a little volkswagen named Herbie who comes into the posession of one Jim Douglas, a down on his luck race driver.  The car though is no regular old car as he finds soon enough. It has a mind of it's own and is winning race after race and the two are building quite the strong bond.  Along for the ride are his mechanic buddy named Tennessee who Buddy Hacket played perfectly and a once proper and sophisticated girl who falls for Jim along the way. The villan of this story is one Thorndyke who has been losing race after race to this car and wants nothing more then the complete destruction of Herbie. The story builds up to some great humourous moments and some heart felt ones and even some sad moments.  The great climax includes a cross country race in which Jim and Throndyke are doing what ever they can to outwit the other. This is a movie that all in your family will love and want to watch over and over.
If the great movie itself wasn't enough, the great bonus features included in this DVD make the price even more the bargain. The best feature is probably the commentary that the three heroic stars (Dean Jones, Michele Lee and Buddy Hackett) do while the movie is going on.  If that wasn't enough the whole second disk that comes with this is just full of bonus materials. Everything a Love Bug fan could dream of and more. Movie Trailers, cut scenes, info on all the other movies and shows that Herbie was in after Love Bug, info on the stars.. much much more.
I can't stress enough how much fun this movie is and the best is , it really doesn't matter what age you are. You could be 5 or 17 or 50 and you will find fun here.  If anything it's great to see the type of things that went on in 1969 in some of the bonus materials . Even teh song that plays through the whole film will get stuck in your head as it's so catchy. If you want a great movie that truly stands the test of time, this is the one for you. And you too will fall in love with number 53 the second you lay your eyes on him.",1062720000,,2426,4.04375

Soon, Douglas is back on top after racing Herbie in several races.  Problems arise when his sudden success goes to Douglas' head.  The story of Herbie, the car with a mind of its own, is a great one for kids and adults.  By the end of the movie, you will begin to see Herbie as a real human being if you already haven't by then.  This is a great movie about friendship as well as a good story about race car driving.
 Dean Jones is perfectly cast as Jim Douglas, the driver who shoots to the top with Herbie.  At first he is also skeptical about the little car's ability, but even he begins to believe.  Michelle Lee plays Carol Bennett, the love interest who in the beginning works for Douglas' rival, Peter Thorndyke.  David Tomlinson is hysterical in this role as the driver obsessed with finding out what makes Herbie go.  Buddy Hackett is also great as Tennessee Steinmetz,  Jim's friend who has a trace of hippie in him.  The Special Edition DVD is truly awesome and should not be missed.

The final showdown comes at the El Dorado, with Herbie's fate on the line.  If Thorndyke throws everything he can at the little car, can Herbie still win the race and save the day?
I remember watching this movie years ago when I was a kid.  It was loads of fun with lots of silly stuff to keep me entertained.  Rewatching it as an adult, I found the same parts thrilled me.  Guess I'm just a big kid after all.  The movie is funny, but with a great heart.  The cast give wonderful performances as well.  The special effects, while showing their age at times, still often stand up to their modern day computer generated counterparts.
This DVD release of a classic is great.  The first disc features the movie in widescreen format.  While the picture does show its age at times, for the most part it's sharp.  Also included is an audio commentary.  Dean Jones and Buddy Hackett were in the studio together, while Michelle Lee recorded hers separately.  Both are then placed together on one track.  Michelle's is the better of the two, providing some interesting information about this movie and the process of making movies in general.
The second disc provides all kinds of information that any fan will love.  There's a documentary on the making of this movie, including information on special effects and goofs.  Also included are documentaries on Herbie mania and the sequels.  Other highlights include the original trailer and information on a couple of deleted scenes.

Mystic-minded hippie-type Tennessee Steinmetz (Buddy Hackett) argues that this is the case when his roommate, down-on-his-luck race driver Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) acquires a Volkswagen Beetle that frequently refuses to comply with its driver's demands. Tennessee claims that the car is alive, and names it Herbie. Jim doesn't believe this for a second, but that doesn't stop him from using the car's unusual speed to bring success to his previously undistinguished racing career. Meanwhile, Peter Thorndyke (David Tomlinson), the snobbish and hot-tempered owner of the dealership where Douglas bought the car, is having fits over Douglas' inexplicable winning streak. A race driver himself, Thorndyke becomes Jim's (and Herbie's) primary rival, resorting to increasingly sneaky tactics to prevail on the racetrack. Jim believes his own driving skill deserves the credit for his newfound success, but finally comes to believe the truth about Herbie in time for the final climactic race.
By far the funniest and best of Disney's Herbie series, The Love Bug is silly fun that's still smartly written enough to be fun for all ages. The special effects are somewhat dated and primitive, but they suffice. It's not easy to make a car show emotion, but here it's done with surprising effectiveness. It also doesn't hurt that as a car, the VW Bug has a lot of personality to start with. The human actors do well too; Dean Jones makes for a likeable hero, and Michele Lee the love interest. However, the real comic gold comes from Buddy Hackett as the offbeat Tennessee, who in Jim's words is `just in off a flying saucer,' and David Tomlinson as British rival Thorndyke, whose angry outbursts are deliciously over-the-top without crossing the fine line into obnoxious overacting.",1051747200,,1989,5.048632218844984

1176573,5,B0000022W1,"Hey, remember me from the Beauty and the Beast review?
Well, this time, I am talking about Disney's 1969 classic, The Love Bug. It is a great movie, with Herbie, the self-racing Beetle. In this movie, two men who love racing buy the car and race it in many tracks. This is what makes the movie so exciting.
Here's something more exciting: that I think, after many years on last-century videotape, Disney should put this movie on a shiny disc. (or a DVD, whichever you prefer.)
Here are some reasons why: First of all, for those of you who have an older video collection or a rental store nearby, there is a version of The Love Bug on a 15 or 20 year old tape (with neon effects of Mickey at the beginning, probably from the early days of VCRs), and second, many Disney classics are already being put onto DVD (like The Parent Trap, Mary Poppins, Snow White, and Beauty and the Beast).
The DVD should have the movie itself (full and wide screen), digitally remastered, THX certified, the original trailer, maybe a documentary or two, foreign language audio and subtitles, and a Herbie Racing game (using the menu arrow buttons as the steering wheel and the enter button, or OK, or set, depends on what DVD player you're using.) And, they should issue the DVD in 2004, for when Disney can call it a ""Walt Disney 35th Anniversary Collector's Edition"" to make it a big seller.
Only one question: Will it change the way Love Bug fans watch this movie forever? You'll find out when the DVD comes out later!",1024099200,7,1500,4.518382352941177
1176574,3,B0000022W1,"A friend and I rented this movie to get up to speed on Bruce Campbell's work (of Evil Dead fame, among countless other movies and TV shows), and did all we could to keep from turning the thing off. It's an entertaining family film and it's simple storyline, humorous scenes and ""gee whiz"" happy ending will please the youngsters. But if you are looking for a good plot and solid acting, forget it. A highpoint of the film comes with the cameo appearance of Dean Jones, and it was interesting to see John Hannah and Kevin J. O'Connor before they were in The Mummy. As for Campbell, it was probably one of his worst lead performances I've ever seen. But in the end, it's Herbie...and everyone love Herbie.",992304000,5,703,4.5
1176575,5,B0000022W1,"I watched the original ""The Love Bug"" growing up and loved it! I was so thrilled when Disney made this new movie for T.V. In the begining of this movie, things are looking very bad for Herbie. After losing another race, he is sent to the scrap pile. Luckily, he is recued by Hank, a mechanic, who fixes him up. From there, Herbie is back up to his old tricks, including geting Hank and his ex-girlfriend Alex back together. But when an evil Love Bug, Harold, is created, Hank and Harold's owner must race for their cars. Can Herbie defeat this enemy? This price is wonderful and The video is in a clamshell case so you can preserve it for years to come!",989798400,2,653,4.317073170731708
1176576,3,B0000022W1,"First off, let me say I'm glad that this film exists, it being our first Herbie fix in fifteen years, the abortive 1982 television series being the last one. It's great to see good old Herb again, even if it's only a TV movie.
Having said that, let me continue by saying they screwed up pretty bad. There were many major mistakes in this film (which had a good idea and was set up to be a nice nostalgia fest) that really drug the whole thing down. Here's a list, in no particular order. WARNING: The following contains info that could be seen as spoilers.
1. Herbie. Call me a perfectionist, but Herbie just looks wrong here. He should have a gray interior and sunroof, not white. The racing stripes are supposed to be painted on the sunroof, too. The `53' is up way too high on the hood and it's the wrong font as well. They managed to get these things right all through four feature films and a TV series, why not here?
2. Kevin J. O'Connor. I know he's supposed to be an artist, but this guy is just waaaaay too creepy for my taste. It was a good thing in `The Mummy', but here it's out of place.
3. The origin story. I'm sorry, but this just does not jive with what we've been told before. The impression given in `Herbie Rides Again' was that some machines just develop personalities. And did Dr. Stumpfel also build the Lancia in `Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo'? Plus, I'd like to think my government is not THAT stupid. I found their portrayal of our military in here fairly insulting. Plus, in the eighteen years it took to build Herbie, you'd think they'd figure out it was just a translation error.
4. The final race. It was SLOW. In the other films you got a sense of speed. Here it seems like both cars are going thirty-five, a situation which one shot shown at high speed just doesn't fix. Plus, unlike the previous films there is absolutely no suspense about Herbie winning. The character of Simon Moore seems to almost go out of his way to make it easy for them. (Also, Chuck's car troubles were barely worth the first scene with them, we definitely didn't need to cut back to him two more times.)
5. CGI effects. Back in the sixties and seventies, Disney, using only some creative editing and some mechanical know-how, made Herbie appear to do amazing things. It was cheap and you knew it was an effect, but the end result always seemed to look pretty good. Now it's the days of digital effects and we have a digital Herbie. It screams `FAKE!' Unlike the old effects, it's impossible to suspend your disbelief watching this thing. Come on Disney, you sometimes need a guy with a wrench, not a computer, to make things look good.
6. Title. Thanks to lack of creativity in thinking up a title, most people think this film's a remake. It's not. Although it shares a bit of story arc with the original, this is a new film.
7. Horace. The idea of an evil Herbie is seriously creepy, but the filmmakers didn't do much with it. Horace seems to be only a fraction of the menace he could have been.
8. Writing. The dialogue is terrible. It sometimes seems like they wrote the children's novelation first, then the script.
9. Bruce Campbell. Bruce, I really like you as an actor, but could at some point in this film, try acting a just a bit? Just a suggestion.
Well, having said what was wrong, I want to mention something they got very right. The scene where Jim Douglas gets behind the wheel of Herbie for first time in years is a great piece of acting. You can practically see the memories running through his head. It was so perfect, it bought a tear to my eye. Good work, Dean.",987811200,8,3587,4.379310344827586
1176577,3,B0000022W1,"Bruce Campbell is Hank Cooper, a flop of a racecar driver reduced to the role of an inattentive mechanic in a small autoshop. Hank's mind is still on serious racing, and it's seriously affecting his work. Everything is about to change for Hank though, because his boss, Chuck, has just entered him into a car repair and racing contest in which the winner will get to keep the junker he manages to fix and race with. When Hank's coworker and best friend, mechanic/installation artist Roddy,  sympathizes with a broken down little VW bug that none of the other contestants want to work on, Hank gets sympathetic too. He selects the little beetle, our old friend ""Number Fifty-Three,"" Herbie! Hank gets the engine running again, with a little horn-communication help from Herbie, translated by the very intuitive Roddy, and, after a late start, the little car and his driver blow the competition away! Suddenly, everyone is amazed by Hank, but even more-so by Herbie, whose name is made known thanks to a maker's inscription under his hood. Hank starts to get a bit jealous of the car's popularity, especially when everyone is ogling it at Roddy's art show. What bothers him even more though, is the lack of respect he gets from magazine reporter Alex Davis, an ex-girlfriend of Hank's who also gives all the credit for winning the race to the humble little Volkswagen. Despite his sour grapes, Hank and Herbie have already started forming a bond, and when he notices the troublemaking, extremely wealthy Simon Moore III, an old competitor of his, taking an unwelcome interest in Herbie, he doesn't like it. Hank comes to Herbie's defense, and he and the bug chase Simon away, but not before Simon gets a peak at Herbie's inscription and pockets Herbie's original VW key. Simon is determined to find out what makes Herbie tick, and to do so, he sends his lackey out to retrieve Herbie's creator, an aging German engineer by the name of Dr. Stumpfel. The doctor tells Simon a fascinating and magical story of how Herbie came to be such a ""special"" little car, a story reminiscent of the Powerpuff Girls in point of fact. Unfortunately, the doctor is confiding in the wrong person! Simon convinces him to create a second ""magical car"" using the stolen VW key, only this time, Simon adds his own flavor to the metal mix. The result is a solid black Volkswagen bug with a heart of steel and the mind of a vicious animal! When Herbie gets his feelings hurt one night and runs away from Hank and the gang, he encounters his evil twin, dubbed ""Horace"" by his equally wicked owner, in a dark and lonely alleyway. Horace makes short work of Herbie, and the destruction is so horrendous that we next see Herbie in a pine box surrounded by his mourning new friends. Enter a living legend: Jim Douglas (Dean Jones). Herbie's original race-driver, Jim knows the little car is more resilient than he looks. With the help of Jim and Dr. Stumpfel, the gang rebuilds Herbie using all his original parts. Everyone is biting nails when Jim is given the honor of starting Herbie up again and seeing if he's still ""there."" Luckily, he is, and the reunion between Jim and Herbie is more than a little tearful for us diehard fans. Still, this is Hank's adventure now, and Jim and Herbie bid each other a fond farewell. The good feelings don't last long though. Simon, driving by in his monstrous Volkswagen creation, notices that Herbie is somehow in one piece again! Determined to get the little bug out of his mind and prove that evil is stronger than good, he and Horace challenge Hank and Herbie to a racing duel! The winning driver getting to keep the loser's car!

The world of Herbie the racing Volkswagen bug has always had its continuity issues, none more severe than this little 1997 anomaly of a TV sequel, unoriginally titled ""The Love Bug"" and starring B-movie legend Bruce Campbell. True, Herbie doesn't look exactly perfect, but he still looks and acts like Herbie, and the key to a good Herbie film, a great cast, is still there. Acting quality aside, who doesn't love Bruce Campbell? And he fits the mechanic/wannabe racecar driver role well. Alexandra Wentworth is lovely and humorous as ex-girlfriend Alex Davis, and ""Mummy"" fans will be thrilled to see both John Hannah and Kevin J. O'Connor together again! Kevin makes a fine, modernized substitute for Buddy Hackett's Tennessee Steinmetz, and John makes a great spoiled rich-boy villain! And, for added fun, former ""Monkee"" Micky Dolenz even has a small role in this one! Of course, what makes this film a must-own for Herbie fans is the touching reunion between Dean Jones's Douglas character and Herbie the car! It truly brings a tear to the eye! The film itself is flawed, sure, but it's still a good, fun Herbie movie that lives up to the Herbie name! I'll ignore the lame reuse of the original film's title, even though it makes everyone, even Disney archivists, refer to this TV sequel as a remake(a real pet-peeve of mine!). Probably the only real flaws in this film are the origin story, the intensity of the final race, and the music. It's for these reasons that I bring it down a star from the previous ""Love Bug"" sequels. I can take the origin story; I think it's one of the things that makes this film ""special"" in the Herbie line. It's the major continuity flaw of the whole thing in my opinion, because it doesn't perfectly fit the ideas of the previous films, not to mention ""Herbie: Fully Loaded,"" the most recent theatrical sequel that totally ignores this TV movie in its own continuity. Still, it doesn't EXACTLY counter the ideas of the previous films either. Yes, other Herbie movies include other ""living"" machines, but whose to say each doesn't have its own secret origin story? The idea that well-loved machines develop personalities was more theory than anything, and this origin plot doesn't totally deflect that theory. As for the final race, I will say that this should have been much more intense and should have looked faster. This is probably the most serious flaw in the film, because it actually has to do with the writing. There have been complaints of the CGI Herbie, perhaps this whole film was just an early test for the concept of future Herbie sequels like the wonderful ""Fully Loaded,"" but in truth, it doesn't look any faker than SOME scenes in past Herbie sequels. I noticed some pretty bad effects during the bullfight in ""Herbie Goes Bananas,"" a personal fave of mine... There's not A LOT of noticeable CGI in this film, so let's not overblow it. In truth, what bothers me the most about this 1997 ""Love Bug,"" a film that I really like for the most part, is the music! Herbie's theme is nowhere to be heard! Instead, we get some typically bad TV movie background music, including a lame attempt at western showdown music that gets played quite a bit. If I could change only one thing about ""Love Bug"" 1997, it would be to add the original Herbie theme music in place of that stuff. Aside from that, I really find it a nice addition to the Herbie line. What makes it an anomaly is the fact that it is sadly disregarded in Herbie history now that ""Herbie: Fully Loaded"" is out there. And, I fear that the Lindsay Lohan hit, which I love, may keep this one from ever seeing a DVD release. I'll keep my fingers crossed though, and hope that 1997's ""Love Bug"" AND the short-lived TV series, make it onto DVD someday. Until then, I do recommend picking up this ""Love Bug"" SEQUEL on VHS today, even if only to see Dean Jones back in the driver's seat one more time!",980812800,7,7548,4.661665416354088
1176578,5,B0000022W1,"This is funny movie that reveals that cars do have hearts, souls, and personalities.
Herbie is a car with a very strong personality who decides he likes Jim Douglas, a race car driver.  When Jim starts winning all his races with Herbie, he is positive that he should get all the credit for his success.  Little does he know how tender Herbie's feelings really are.  Eventually Jim decides Herbie is past his usefulness, and he brings home a new car, who the jealous Herbie beats up before ""running"" away.  Finally Jim realizes just how special Herbie really is, and finds the little car attempting to commit suicide.  When the pair are finally reunited on happier terms, they enter another race where Herbie's strength is tested at almost every turn, and Jim is able to completely see that Herbie is really the one who can be credited for all their success.
Adding to their trouble, or perhaps creating most of it, is the sneaky Mr. Thorndyke, who will do anything to see Herbie taken away for good.  Then there's tender hearted Tennessee, who believes in Herbie all along.
This movie is funny and enjoyable and proves that vehicles are a lot more than just transportation.  I recommend it to anyone, young and old alike, who enjoys fun movies.",978480000,6,1244,4.7050691244239635
