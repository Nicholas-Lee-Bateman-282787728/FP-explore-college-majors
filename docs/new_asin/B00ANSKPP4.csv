8554868,5,B00ANSKPP4,"I found this DVD to be very helpful and informative. Mariusz does a great job of explaining how to find great stock picks. He breaks it down into several parts. On the blog part of the DVD, he shows you some websites that you can go to and he explains about each site, who created them, and what to expect for people that have never been on these types of sites before. On the hedge fund part of the DVD, he explains what hedge fund companies are and what you should look at and why. He also talks about what investment-sharing websites are and how you can join them, but if you don't want to join them, how you can look at their sites for free and take information and research it further on your own. He talks about EDGAR and how you can find information on that site.",1356998400,,770,4.174496644295302

Usually you only hear about companies such as Apple, Amazon, and Google. And these companies are fine for big portfolios. Since I have a small portfolio, I am interested in finding the small gems that can appreciate much more.",1355702400,,380,5.0476190476190474
8554870,5,B00ANSKPP4,"This video show you many different ways of finding investment ideas. Some of them include reading blogs, following various hedge funds, and paying attention to insider buys. On the video, he talks about specific blogs to read and specific hedge funds to follow. I never heard of many of these hedge funds before because all of them invest in small cap companies. I think that's where the highest risk/reward ratio is.  If I want to invest time doing my own research on top of my day to day job, I don't want to waste my time with stocks that everybody in the world is following.  If I did, what would be the likelihood that I would discover a company where relevant factors are NOT already reflected in the price of the stock?  I'm therefore grateful to learn from this video how to do my investigating away from the beaten and well worn path, while still finding stocks that stock professionals have already found and are investing their money in.  While this should make finding undervalued companies easier, I hope I never get too lazy to do my own research on those names.  That way I could determine which are good undervalued companies, and which are companies someone on the internet is just trying to pump up!  Fundamental research is where the other DVD's in the series come in, and I found each one to be very useful in its own area of investing.",1355443200,,1356,4.559670781893004
