8109662,4,B000EHL2N8,This is a high quality instructional on the fundementals of Modern Army Combatives prior to 2000. Every technique on this video is still in the level I program but more have been added including fighting over your rifle. The instruction is clear and easy to follow. My only complaint is the length of the disclaimer and the fact that you cannot bypass it.,1323302400,,355,4.650793650793651
8109663,5,B000EHL2N8,"very well done. fyi, your correct, its not mma, its gracie ju-jitsu, which is far better. I watched this dvd 5X, and it just keeps getting better. I have orderd the 2nd disc, and I hope/expect it to be as good or better (and more difficult!) it also ephsises on finishing the fight quickly, which is very importent if your fighting multiple attackers, or if energie conservation is required. on a final note, if your trying to fight in a flat, padded, wide open area, where breaking arms and choking you opponent is considerd ""unsportsmenlike,"" you will have a lot of difficulty, but may still do well. but if your in the middle of a jungle full of tripping undergroth and slippery wet ground, wearing heavy jungle or combat boots that make it almost imposible to kick well in, and your enemy might be wearing a helmet and bullet proof vest that make it very difficult to mke a succsessful punch, this will do wonders. sorry about the bad spelling. hope this helps.",1322092800,,965,4.583815028901734
8109664,4,B000EHL2N8,"First of all, while there may be a similarity, this is not MMA. For those military personnel who are deploying, and need your level I, I can recommend it just because there are so many moves, I have had a hard time remembering all of them, and I have taken the class at least once a year. With that in mind, I felt it was worth the money. Beware that rumor has it the Army is moving away from ground fighting, but never the less, there are some good moves in here that can be very useful, especially if you like to mixmatch techniques.",1280016000,2,535,4.153846153846154
8109665,3,B000EHL2N8,"The production value is pretty good, and the instruction is clear and easy to follow.

But. . .

I have a 4th degree in Taekwondo and a 3rd degree in Hapkido, and have been studying GJJ for a couple years.  I agree GJJ may have been a starting point for Army Combatives, but they are very different.  This is a good starting point, but for clarity and a much better learning experience i highly recommend going over to the Gracie website and ordering their videos.  They are twice the price, but they're worth five times the price.  Plus you can watch the army combatives video for free online.",1147651200,,594,4.453703703703703
8109666,2,B000EHL2N8,"I'm going to use this video as a backdrop, because this video shows what's wrong with the Army in its approach to combatives.  At the end of this video, it says that one of the instructors is a MMA competitor that is undefeated, and it lists tournaments he has won.  All the tournaments are folk/catch/collegiate style wrestling, none of them use submissions.  A quick search on sherdog.com reveals this undefeated instructor only had one fight, and he lost it.

All throughout the Army, people are being told that they are learning BRAZILIAN JUJITSU and not Army combatives.  BJJ takes several years to learn, ARMY combatives less than a few months.  The Army's level four class only scratches the surface of the techniques involved.  So, outside from the dishonesty of the people producing this video, the Army in general deserves credit for teaching sloppy techniques, and then passing it off as BJJ.  That rant aside, let's get on with the quality of the video itself.

It starts off with an INCREDIBLY long disclaimer.  You have to watch this disclaimer everytime you pop the DVD in, there is no fast forwarding, going to menu, or otherwise exiting.  The disclaimer is about two minutes long, which is annoying if you're planning on watching this dvd to learn moves, since if it stops or gets restarted you watch the same, non-skippable dvd warning.  I actually burned it onto my hard drive and bypassed the problem, but this is a huge no-go.

The instructor has a good voice, the lighting is good, and the demonstrations are clear.  However, it's straight from the F.M.  For example, the guard pass shown is never used in BJJ.  It's almost a guaranteed triangle choke.  I say ""almost"" because there's a chance the guy may not know how to do one.  Particularly as demonstrated.  The Gracie's keep their hand on the hip when doing this pass, with the head held high to avoid getting pulled into the choke.  This guy puts his head down and puts the hand on the bicep of the opponent, making it easy to drag across into the choke.  (The same move is in Gracie's ""Top game"" series).

Again, it's basic.  Only a few positions are shown, (mount, guard, and side mount), and a few moves.  For the thirty dollars I paid for this, you can get much better videos for beginners and advanced students.  Unless you just have an absolute hankering for the Army combatives manual, this is an overpriced DVD with bullshido all over it.",1139961600,5,2424,4.7007125890736345
