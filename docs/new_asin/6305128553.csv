7883308,4,6305128553,"This movie was enjoyable. The first thing i noticed watching this video is the previews of other scary family entertainment flicks. Too cool. I think the studio is the one who created/owns the Puppet Master series b/c they're all in the previews and stuff.

Anyway as far as the cover of this video, it's a bit deceiving. Not at all related or taken from the story. The actual story takes place somewhere in Europe. Everyone's dressed in old clothes but the main girl. She's the only one dressed inthe late 1990's look. Everyoen else looks something like 18th and 19th century. But it works i guess. (at least for the americans who don't known about europe).

anyway check it out. the werewolf is moreso a wolfman. You know typical torn up shirt and jeans. makeup face (think a monster squad look, but a tad bit better).",1198886400,,820,4.609589041095891

7883310,1,6305128553,"Not a bad retelling of the story for teenagers. Some scares, but I find it awfully hard to allow any ofensive language in movie that are specifically designed for the younger audiences. Our children may be using the language and hearing it, but does it make it right. As far as gore, there is very little to none. I rated it a 1 for the main fact of the language. Outside of that I would give it a 3.",989625600,,400,4.075949367088608
7883311,3,6305128553,"Ok..well..I saw the movie(duh)..i rented it..it was ok..not of what i was  expecting..the story was good..they could have made it a little longer an  better..the werewolf effects were advrage..better than the howling  2,3,4,5..atleast werewolf reborn showed the werewolf..but it is an  entertianing movie..i say make your 5 (possibly 4) year old to 7 or/& 9  year old watch it..(an the ages inbetween)..i think those ages would get  frightend out of it..but ages that are older..would either hate it or rate  it ok.",969235200,,515,5.2073170731707314
7883312,4,6305128553,"This is a truly entertaining movie, especially for those new to the world  of classic horror, though this is new. It stars actors from popular tv  series. The makers of this movie are true horror fans who love wahat  they're doing. The story is about right for a werewolf movie. A girl is  visiting her werewolf uncle in a faraway village. She learns he's a  werewolf and tries to help him - until he turns on her and she knows what  she must do. The werewolf itself is scary(not too scary), and the  transformation is wonderfully done. Not destined for fame, THE WEREWOLF  REBORN made me remember that there still are people who still appreciate  the good ol days of monster movies.",965433600,,683,4.532786885245901
