1685240,5,B000062WWL,"The Kidsongs, is a great series of a bunch of Kids singing a lot of songs and doing some great moves! Each Kidsongs videotapes tells a different story.

In this story, the Kidsongs Kids and Billy and Ruby Biggle go to different places to sing and dance.

The songs in this cassette are:

""Walkin' The dog""

""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes""

""Alley Cat""

""La Bamba""

""Put Your Little Foot Right There""

""Loco-Motion""

""Peppermint Twist""

""Rock Around The Clock""

""Paw Paw Patch""

The songs are all really cute and fun to listen to. My baby-sitting charge, Garfield and I can't get enough of the Kidsongs cassettes! We both love it!

Lots Of Love,

  Fulliem XOXOXOXO",1106870400,,666,4.7105263157894735
