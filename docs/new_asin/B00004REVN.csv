7920859,5,B00004REVN,"An excellent factual overall look at our present knowledge of one of the most fascinating dinosaurs known to man.  The historical background of T. rex's inital discovery and some of the early ideas about the beast is quite interesting, especially the vintage photos.  Our current knowledge is effectively presented featuring interviews with the paleontologists studying T. rex.  Both sides of controversial ideas are fairly presented. The special effects are extremely well-done. For a fascinating look at an awesome dinosaur I highly recommend this 50-min. video.",1031875200,,564,5.6117647058823525
