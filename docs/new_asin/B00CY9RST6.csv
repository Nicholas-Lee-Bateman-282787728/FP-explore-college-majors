8587470,5,B00CY9RST6,"When I fist saw James Taylor I didn't know who he was.  I was at a friends house and the TV was on and I saw a young man on the TV, walk out into the middle of a gymnasium and sit down on a chair in the middle of the floor and he started to play the guitar and sing and I was blown away at the expressiveness of the playing and the haunting words of the songs.  I've been a Taylor fan since, but I've never really enjoyed him very much with a band behind him.  The expressiveness of his playing gets lost in the muddle of instruments and backup singers.  Here is pure James Taylor like that first time I saw him, when he was still that ""one man band"" with all the expression there.  You also sense how unused he is to fame and attention.  He almost seems embarrassed that people are so excited about his music.  This is classic James Taylor in every sense.",1419638400,2,856,4.029585798816568
