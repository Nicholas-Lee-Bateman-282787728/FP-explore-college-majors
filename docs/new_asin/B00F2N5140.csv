8611744,5,B00F2N5140,"The characters in Plateye are distinctly drawn, the writing is exquisite, plot is convincing and briskly paced. The author seems thoroughly grounded in the history the Southeast states during the two generations that followed the USA's War of Independence. The writing is exquisite. Her depiction of the lives and persons of the African slaves and the Native people contributes as much to the intertwined plots as that of the European characters in the book. I stayed up late, four nights in a row, reading this one. Highly recommended.",1462924800,,536,5.1022727272727275
