8294292,4,B001DN0URG,"School Rumble Second Semester Part 1 is one the funniest series I have seen in a while since Lucky Star. The series plays on all the different various love triangles that we keep seeing in anime and kind of reminds us of all the different kinds of people that we see in school. People like the juvenile delinquent, the airhead, the spoiled rich kid, the timid shy kid, and every other kind of person you knew or saw when you went to high school. I would definitely recommend School Rumble as one the funniest anime series ever made.",1254182400,,532,4.438775510204081
8294293,1,B001DN0URG,"I was very disappointed on when I received my dvds in the mail both dvd cases were bursted up very badly.  the box was all bent up to pieces as well.  The DVDs were fine and play good, but I'm disappointed on how they were shipped.  I don't want my money back on the dvds all I want is to make sure you do a better job on shipping your items in next time.",1249689600,,355,3.77027027027027
8294294,5,B001DN0URG,"I had been searching for a good, funny anime since finishing Azumanga Daioh and this is it. You can read above for descriptions on the show, but, yes, it does start off where season one ended and is generally just as good as season one (a bit less humor and a bit more romance).
Be aware--this season is NOT the end of the series. There is a special that 'ends' the anime, but it has not been licensed for release in the US (there is a reason for this: it is absolutely horrible [it flash-backs to a ton of stuff that you never saw (they tried to cram a full season into an hour-long show... basically, it leaves you confused and makes you think you've missed about 10 episodes somewhere along the line...]).
The above does not make season one or season two any less enjoyable--they are perfect on their own or together and highly recommended for a good laugh. Just be prepared for the story to suddenly drop off at the end of the season (which is fine for a goofy show like this one!).",1236470400,4,986,4.306451612903226
8294295,4,B001DN0URG,"This set continues off right where the previous season ended and takes off from there.  From a fan's perspective, this show continues to entertain and cause a lot of laugh-out-loud moments.  I think its not quite as entertaining as the previous season, and I am not entirely sure why.  It may have something to do with the basketball story arc (yes, you heard me), or more about preparing for the festival (this set does include the ""gun battle"" arc as well, which gives the series a different feel for sure).

In the end, while it may not capture the greatness of the first season, it is still highly recommended to anyone who even slightly enjoyed the first season.",1234742400,2,667,4.627118644067797
8294296,4,B001DN0URG,"This anime is one of my favorites - the humor is awesome in my opinion - though the second season is a little more ""mature"" (or perhaps immature?) than the first was.

Funimation did a good job with the dub IMO - and I'm slightly picky about voices.",1225065600,2,249,4.1875
