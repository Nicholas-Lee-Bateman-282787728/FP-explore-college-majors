742306,5,6303704603,"Very interesting movie of one of the brightest minds in the 20th Century. It is not a traditional one, the sets are often very surrealistic. All we have is some ""imprints"" or scenes with an interpretation of the  life of this extraordinary thinker.",920160000,9,248,4.767441860465116
742382,4,6303704603,"British filmmaker Derek Jarman's penultimate film consists basically on literate deadpan tableaux dealing with the life of Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951). The late Jarman, who was known for making gay-themed experimental movies, filmed the whole of Wittgenstein in a indoor stage, as a series of mannerist vignettes. If you want to watch this movie to know about Wittgenstein's theories, don't bother. These are dealt superficially and  perfunctorily, while emphasis is made on his homosexuality. This movie is not very deep, but is not very heavy either, I think this was a bit of frivolous exercise on the part of Jarman but it is also funny and and quite entertaining.",1323993600,2,693,5.3
742383,4,6303704603,"The philosopher Wittgenstein is notable for his attempt, in the Tractatus, to create a formally logical philosophy.  Trying to delineate and characterize those objects and ideas in the universe that can be described via language, he proceeded to enumerate the requisite foundational ideas in a hierarchy to reveal their relationships to each other.  But, as he later clarified, he thought that the most important aspect of this was the complement of his endeavor, that is, the portion of the universe that cannot be described.  The unnameable and unknowable are far more important than the trivialities encompassed by mere words.

Or course Wittgenstein later rejected the Tractatus as a failure and adopted a theory centered around language games.  He considered the collection of possible games one that is impossible to describe because of its complexity.  He supported this using the analogy of ""family resemblance"" that relates one game to another.  His illustrations, unfortunately, all fall within the set of mathematical objects covered by mathematical game theory (including everything from hopscotch to poker, Go to quantum games).  While that does not mean that his insights cannot be useful, it does imply that his pronouncements must be considered with some care.

This film, with its minimal dialogue and sets, bare and black backgrounds and short scenes, is imitative of the structure of the Tractatus.  And it relates to the life of Wittgenstein just as the Tractatus does to the world.  The film is a minimalist work of art whose subject is Wittgenstein, not a documentary.  It focuses on the kind of tales that a student in philosophy learns in the hallway during the first year in graduate school.  It's campy, fun and filled with humor and social critique.  By the end, the missing backgrounds have come to symbolize the depth of missing information needed to understand Wittgenstein's philosophical views.

I enjoyed it as a work of art.  It might be an interesting way to expose a rebellious or inquisitive person to some philosophical ideas and people in an entertaining way.  Perhaps such a viewer will be tempted to fill in those missing backgrounds.",1311724800,4,2175,5.168571428571428

742385,2,6303704603,"This is an excruciatingly disappointing little skit, not a film at all, but a kind of pretentious panto. It is all the more disappointing that such enormous talents set to work on this, a shallow engagement, not unlike a work set into motion by the likes of John Cleese and Monty Python. With a tweak here and there, this would indeed take its place in the repertoire of English comedy. As conceived by Jarmen and company, however, it is as humorless as it is trivial. It reminded me of the scenes in Ken Russell's ""Women in Love,"" in which Alan Bates, playing a young D.H. Lawrence, gets knocked on the head with a paper weight swing by an enraged Ottoline Morrell, only in that piece actions had purpose and emotions had moment. In Jarmen's hands, Bertrand Russell and Ottoline Morrell talk but they say and do nothing. As for Wittgenstein, well...we see him here as the English, no doubt, saw him, that is, as nothing more than a genius, overbearing and silly. Jarmen is known as a film maker, but here we get nothing more than off-Broadway, low-budget theatricals on film. Incredibly, there is nothing said of the era, nothing made of his background, save for a few gushing comments about his family's wealth, something the filmmaker seems to make much of and to admire. For a director known for being daring, this is a remarkably tame little exercise. Old men who couple with young boys may be having the time of their lives, but one has to be shown more than two shirtless males embracing to be convinced. This entire affair has an embarrassing adolescent quality, something one might expect from public school boys run amok over a summer. Wittgenstein deserves far more than this silly work.",1227657600,2,1698,4.701342281879195
742386,4,6303704603,"There are obvious paralles between Derek Jarman and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Both were prodigys and both were homosexuals who struggled to make sense of themselves in a world that either did not acknowledge that homosexual culture existed or vilified it. And both were iconoclasts in their respective mediums who were nonetheless obsessed with religious themes and reading their own lives within the context of traditional culture. But there the parallels end for temperamentally the two are absolutely incommensurable. Wittgenstein is a humorously irreverent child prodigy but a humorless adult. Lucky for us Jarman keeps the child version of Ludwig around as a kind of ludic spirit to lighten the gloomy load that is always weighing on the adult Ludwig's joyless mind. Cleverly, Jarman has everyone except the joyless adult Ludwig wear primary colors and act as if nothing at all weighed on their clever Cambridge minds.

The primary relationships and philosophic pursuits of Ludwig's life are briefly explained and explored. The Cambridge set ( represented here by philosopher Bertrand Russell, gay economist John Maynard Keynes, and haughty Bloomsbury socialite Lady Ottoline) are drawn to the Viennese genius and enjoy having him around even though he is for all intents and purposes socially dysfunctional. In fact this philosopher of language is such a poor communicator that he makes a disasterously poor professor. When Bertrand tells Ludwig that his students imitate his behavior it seems ambiguous as to whether Russell means that they mock Wittgenstein's  aristocratic and effette mannerisms or affectionately appropriate them. Its also not clear if this means that Ludwig has made it fashionable to be gay at Cambridge. All of these meanings seem to be suggested but the latter one seems to be the one that Jarman wants to stress without spelling it out (this was made for BBC television after all). It is clear that Jarman is interested in telling gay history here and as such Ludwig would fit into the gay-man-who-cannot-accept-himself-as-gay-man subject position which is doubly sad since the young Ludwig was so proudly and fearlessly anti-normal. As a result of this self-loathing all of Ludwig's relationships (including his relationship with philosophy) are of the love/hate variety. Jarman makes it clear that it was his ascetic nature, his love of clarity and purity, that made him such a groundbreaking philosopher; and he also makes it clear that it was this love of purity that made his self-hatred all the more intense. But, again, Jarman keeps things light. One never feels the heaviness of the actual life as Wittgenstein himself must have felt it. You can judge for yourself whether this is an achievment or an evasion.

In addition to the tragic nature of Wittgenstein's personal story, Jarman is also interested in drawing parallels between the fin de sielce zeitgeist of Ludwig's suicide rampant Vienna and the fin de siecle zeitgeist of his own AIDS rampant London. These contextual parallels would probably have been more fully explored had this been a full blown feature film and not simply a one-hour made for BBC production. As a result this is more like an appetizer than a full meal. But, given the scarcity of Jarman projects, it is savored for what it is.

Ideally, I think Foucault (who was as playful as Jarman when it came to dissecting the systems that order us about) would have been a better match for this director. But its an oddly appealing film nonetheless.

Ironically, Wittgenstein is known for enabling us to see language as a game not with a singular set of rules but with as many sets of rules as there are speech communities. This breakthrough proved to be liberating for many artists and thinkers (Foucault among them who has shed much light on the way discourses shape identity) that followed in his wake, but Wittgenstein himself (tied as he was to the dominant discourse of conventional morality) never seemes to have experienced this breakthrough as liberatory.",1225238400,7,4019,5.13914373088685
742387,3,6303704603,"I have a very mixed opinion on this film. Derek Jarman is renown for doing things in ways that split the audience in two directly opposed parties, and in Wittgenstein he succeeds in doing so within my own critical assessment. It is not as if some things are done well and some are not, rather it is rediculously ingenius. This split is a trademark of Jarman, who died of AIDS complications a year before the release of this Special Edition DVD. His choice of subject in this biographical surrealist enterprise is dictated by elements that parellel the director's life, as was the case in Caravaggio. All his late work is drenched with autobiographical meditations and innuendos that describe himself more so than his subject, although they succeed in recounting an essence that is shared by both. Here Ludwig Wittgenstein is depicted as he was dscribed, particularly by Betrand Russell, John Maynard Keynes, and his befuddled students. Wittgenstein was the type of overweeing explosive intellectual which you either hated or loved, both to no avail. The script is by Terry Eagleton, a cultural critic whose brilliant Marxist literary output, coming from the school of Raymond Williams, has defined a generation of poststructuralist disciples. This joint venture betrays a whimsical attitude that parodies and deconstructs while retaining a modicum of the intellectual zeal that was the bliss and bane, the heaven and hell of the Austrian author of the Tractatus Logico Philosophicus, a work to which Russell wrote the introduction for as his beloved student lamented he had not understood a word of the Tractatus. Typical.
The humor becomes dark and sinister in turns and the surrealist representations are more of a subconscious disorder that seethes within the ebullient mind of the genius. The entire experience (and it is an experience more so than a movie) is a chronological pastiche, a pantomime of human woes. In a philosophical travesty the rediculous flirts with the sublime to furiously assemble a cadre of futile logic and implacable dilemmas that lead to nowhere, which is exactly where Wittgenstein wished to travel. Skits and gigs are memorable and do exhibit the logical depth that characterizes Wittgenstein's axiomatic engagements. Ultimately the operatic insolence is cute but deranged, the logical output limited and limiting, the rhythmic stress cavorting and distempered, the overall outlook so bleak and inordinate that we find our footing in a disoriented state with the same steps being traced over and over. And then, like a spark in the dark of night, a flash illuminates a thought and makes you wonder if you are moving to something that your intelligence mumbles trying to dictate directions. The acting is colorful and suited to a parody, and the performance of Karl Johnson as the adult Wittgenstein is impressive and faithful to the moody temperament of the philosopher's disquietude. His teaching is ludicrous but faithful to the sources we have of his inarticulate frustrations. All in all this is a movie that says more than it seems to. Any criticism due for the indelicate and overbearing role of sexuality in the person of Wittgenstein is well taken, but misunderstood and decontextualized. We have not enough information on the topic, but Jarman and Eagleton use this slant as a means of expression, a method to deconstruct, and an autobographical implementation more so than a biographical depiction. Hence I will refrain from making any comment on the homoeroticism that resonates in the movie. It is a split scene, a split subjetc, a dialectical seismic quake that marks the opening to an abyss that makes this a tragicomic experience leading straight to the inner void.",1217635200,28,3712,5.147350993377484
742388,5,6303704603,"There are no genuine philosophical problems Wittgenstein assures us. It is philosophers who create so-called philosophical problems by confusing themselves with words and misusing language. All philosophy can offer us then is a kind of therapy which can get us over these linguistic confusions.

But there sure are problems in life. There are scientific problems for one. And there are also ethical problems. There are religious problems. Wittgenstein has problems with himself and this is comically explored by the celebrated director Derek Jarman and with a script penned by influential literary critic Terry Eagleton.

It is basically a play. There are some props and costumes and all of it is shot inside with nothing but black backgrounds. The English actor (Karl Johnson) is a veritable Wittgenstein look-a-like, does the accent perfectly (as far as I can tell), and also does a very fine job capturing the intensity of the tortured genius. All other performers are engaging and among the historical figures that we encounter are Bertrand Russell and John Maynard Keynes.

Definitely of interest to anyone fascinated by the eccentric, and somewhat mad, legendary genius philosopher and not to be missed by any fan of Jarman. It's about time this little cinematic gem ""Wittgenstein"" is available on DVD.

742390,5,6303704603,"Wittgenstein was not only a philosophical giant, but also a facinating personality.  He was: gay, but conflicted and ashamed of his sexuality; rich, but he gave away his vast fortune and worked as a laborer; brilliant and vain, but always embarrased by his writings; the darling of academia, even though he rejected the entire philosophical tradition; jewish, but a devout christian convert; brave in war, but lacked the courage to face himself or openly support jewish causes during the war.
These strange contradictions are captured in this visually beautiful and surreal film  (take a gander at the cover--that's supposed to be Wittgenstein as a boy--Bizzare!).  Amid the beautiful lighting, wild colors, and elegant music, the philosophy is somewhat put on the back burner. But that's to be expected, and, if you watch it two or three times, you can pick up what some of Wittgenstein's major arguments were. Even if you don't it's still great fun--sort of philosophical drama with some off beat comedy thrown in.  Watch slowly with an open mind and you're sure to enjoy it!",973468800,42,1077,5.033707865168539
742391,5,6303704603,"This film, which I saw on the big-screen at the Museum of Fine Arts  Houston cinema venue in 1994, was my first introduction to Austrian  linguistic Philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.  In 1994 I was also beginning  my graduate studies in German at Rice University.  I was immediately turned  on to Wittgenstein by the film (scripted by noted British marxist literary  critic Terry Eagleton; --I have come to like Eagleton a great deal also)  and have been reading about him and his philosophy ever since.  From what I  have read in Biographies and commentaries by those that knew L.Wittgenstein  personally, the actor(s) protraying this reclusive, quirky Austrian  intellectual do an excellent job in conveying Wittgensteins life,  personality, and yes, even some of his philosophy, to an English speaking  audience.

7857329,3,6303704603,"I was very disappointed with the film. I am very interested in philosophy and have written books about philosophy and especially about the twelfth century philosopher Maimonides. I, of course, ran across Wittgenstein often, but try as I did, I never understood him. Or to put it differently, to the extent that I understood him, his views seemed to me to be trivial, obvious. I could not understand why people praised him. I hoped to learn about him from this film.
I did learn about his life. Although I think there was too much humor in the film, it did give good information about his life.
But this was not what I was interested in. I wanted to know what his philosophy was. I did not get it from this film. What I did get was that his teacher and friend, the great philosopher Bertrand Russel, thought he was brilliant but he too could not understand what he was saying.",1495584000,,875,4.475

7857333,4,6303704603,"I was delighted to discover this film, doubly so when I realized it was based on a script written by the leading British literary critic, Terry Eagleton, and starring one of my favorite actors, Tilda Swinton. All those things may have had the effect of making it too rich to take in a single sitting. I had to stop midway, not because I was bored or unhappy with the film. It was like drinking 120 proof bourbon straight. I could take just so much at a time. Before I go on to explore that thought, I must say that Karl Johnson, a long time Jarman collaborator, was made up to be a dead ringer for all the Wittgenstein pictures we have, and his acting is a good fit to what we know about the man. Tilda Swinton was hardly recognizable, compared to her snow queen persona in the Narnia film. Her part, as Russell's paramour, is relatively small. Michael Gough was quite good as Wittgenstein's mentor, Bertrand Russell. John Quentin came across quite well as John Maynard Keynes, although I know him less well than I do Wittgenstein and Russell. Derek Jarman, for those who don't know, has a style off to the left of Ken Russell and Peter Greenaway, both of whose works I enjoy. So why was it so hard to watch it through in one sitting. I must attribute it to the fact that I know Wittgenstein's philosophy quite well, far better than 99% of the people who are inclined to watch this movie. Therefore, the script held no secrets from me, as it quoted from Wittgenstein's two major works, and used that to depict the kind of dispair Wittgenstein felt about doing philosophy, which, at its roots, he considered a study which should disappear, once we understand what it is all about. Aside from Wittgenstein and his philosophy, the primary topic of the film is his relations with Russell, Keynes, and an unknown male lover. If you know even a bit about Wittgenstein or his thought, I recommend you see the movie.  If you have little patience for ""thought movies"" (Woody Allen, for example) I suggest you stay away, and go see the film of a Shakespeare play instead.",1464134400,,2061,4.525469168900805
7857334,5,6303704603,"Films about philosophers are incredibly rare, and Jarman's arthouse biopic about early 20th century analytic philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein exceeds the viewer's expectations.  In parts surreal and always cerebral, Wittgenstein lingers with the viewer long after the film has ended - it begs to be seen again and again.  A rare gem that should be seen by anyone who is fascinated by genius and loves ideas and good filmmaking.",1418083200,,426,5.25
7857335,5,6303704603,"This film is the most surprising film you can expect from a deeply impressionistic film maker. Philosophy is by definition not impressionistic since it has to be logical and perfectly well organized in a rational way. Yet Derek Jarman dares to make a film on a philosopher, and actually more on philosophy because the man himself seems to be in a way made secondary.

Wittgenstein was obsessed with language, but not as a tool to express some thoughts or concepts that was able to build itself and its own architecture along with the mind and the mind's architecture that carried language, both through the very use of language and the mind themselves. Language is not seen as self-made and self-making expressive tool used by discourse to enable human thought to emerge, to build itself by expressing itself in communication.

Language for him is a limitation.

He considers logic is the acme of human intelligence, not language and language does not contain the whole logic of the human mind, even if it can express it. In fact he is a visual mind and he tries to express with words a logic he can represent in his mind's eye visually. He does not see that without language logic would never have been constituted. He ignores the fact that time, space and logic are human inventions for the cosmic duration, distance and orientation, and dependent origination (as the Buddhist would say for the last dimension) and are nothing but models of what the human brain and mind can observe in the outside world.

Wuttgenstein was a friend of Bertrand Russell but apparently he did not integrate Russell's lectures on logic delivered in the USA in the 1920s. Russell spent a tremendous amount of energy to demonstrate that what we get from the outside world is nothing but sensations and that these sensations are nothing if they are not interpreted in a way or another by the brain-mind into perceptions. Russell could not know how the brain and mind did it but he knew that these perceptions in their turn should not be considered as the outside world. They were only humanly interpreted representations of the outside world and all our mental work is using these representations and not the real world.

This means that these representations are models and models are nothing but metaphors: they are or are behaving like the outside world, more or less, never entirely. And this is only possible because we have words, and syntax and sentences and discourse to express these models that could not have been built or abstracted from the magma of our sensations without words, sentences, syntax and discourse.

He sees that a dog is what a certain culture calls a dog, more or less I will add. But he misses the other side of the word dog. It is a concept that is produced by man's power to conceptualize that is developing with age and training and that is deposited in our mind, itself developing from brain work as some kind of virtual abstract complex totally human conceptualizing machine.

But in Wittgenstein's vision language becomes a cage, a prison in a way and our mind is like a parrot in a cage itself inside the cage in which we are imprisoned. Derek Jarman is quite right when he reduces Wittgenstein's thought to this image, metaphor, set of metaphors. And it is cruelly but realistically reducing Wittgenstein's thought to nothing but a set of words repeated without them being understood by the repeater. That is very sad.

Hence Wittgenstein reduced intelligence to logic and then life to direct experience of the dirt, dust and mud of the path. There is no way to articulate the real world onto the conceptualizing power of the brain-mind. Then logic is not in anyway helping us to understand man's intelligence or man's consciousness. Logic becomes an escape from real dirty and muddy life and a straight jacket, an escape into the straightjacket of what is socially acceptable and nothing else with a very limited lee way for those who are philosophers supposedly over and higher than normal simple ordinary people.

He missed Russell's basic principle that life is life (the evidence of the pudding is in me being able to eat it) and logic is a conceptualized abstraction of a model from what we capture of the world through our senses for that to be interpreted and architecturally modelized by the brain-mind.

Descartes was seeing our existence in the fact that we were able to think. Wittgenstein went further in a way in identifying language but he did not see that we are not our language. Our language is produced by us in a social context and it may appear as a limitation (grammar is fascist as is well known since 1968) though it is a tremendous power, the power of abstraction and conceptualization that makes man the only being on earth able to create models of the outside reality that give him some power over this reality. The mind is not the parrot in a cage, itself in a cage in which man is imprisoned and reduced to repeating words he has learned by heart. There is no parrot. There is no first cage. There is no second cage. There is self-creating mind in each man whose experience determines what his mind is going to be or rather to become forever because its becoming will never stop, just like the linguistic tool it uses.

A beautiful attempt at making a film on such a subject, but it remains dry and rather cold. Even the personal life of the philosopher is reduced to very little.
