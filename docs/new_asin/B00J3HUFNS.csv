8647729,5,B00J3HUFNS,"Ms. Yui's Beethoven four sonatas are wonderful expressions of Beethoven's monumental works, especially the Sonata in F minor.  Beethoven is my favorite composer, but the F minor sonata was not my favorite until now.  Somehow, I have heard recordings of this sonata played by the giants of the classical music industry, and never resulted in liking it more than the Waldstein or even early works such as op. 2, no. 3.  However, having heard Ms Yui's F minor sonata changed my mind completely.  Perhaps most pianists focus on the first and last movement of this sonata, playing the middle slow movements as an after thought, just a kind of glue for the 1st and last movements, but with Ms Yui's D flat major movement, she achieves a musical balance so true that from the bottom of my heart I feel it is the intention of Beethoven.  This slow theme and variation movement is critical to me for the Appasionata, and for the first time ever, despite many famous pianists' efforts, her technique and musicianship nailed this sonata for Beethoven on the modern piano.  The other 3 sonatas are also wonderfully performed, but I do so much want to highlight this one.

I really appreciate the background information as given by Ms Yui on Beethoven in the DVD, like a mini lecture!  If only all concerts and recitals performances had these side notes, the audience would a stronger inkling of what is being communicated from the musician and composer.

I also would like to highlight the amazing quality of this recording.  Truly, no beautiful instrument could survive intact without an amazing artist playing it, but this particular Yamaha CFX recording is something quite special.  I'm reminded of some of the qualities as suggested by Barenboim in his piano - http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/26/daniel-barenboim-reveals-radical-new-piano-design-ive-fallen-in-love-with-it.  This CFX recording is a wonderful treat.  It is good to know that Yamaha continues to explore new designs and sonic possibilities for a business so obsessed with tradition.",1449187200,,2049,5.210365853658536

8647731,5,B00J3HUFNS,"I would like to add to the positive reviews for Lisa Yui, easily worth 5 stars.
The piano seems ideal for video, much more so than say the violin. Seeing fingers dance along the keyboard is almost like reading the score. So this Bluray of Lisa Yiu playing the Waldstein, familiar music for most music lovers, provides an insight not possible from a CD.
Lisa is a fine pianist, technically proficient and very musical. Three of the four sonatas are essential Beethoven, the fourth a charming lesser work. She introduces each with a short talk with interesting insights.
This release made me think of the value of comparing it to two DVDs that may be in many collections, Horowitz in Moscow and The Goldberg Variations with Glenn Gould. We get great variety here, an authentic pianistic legend, the ultimate eccentric, and a very normal, charming person. Each pianist speaks as well as plays, and each has consciously filmic results, with Gould having the most varied camera angles when he performs.
Comparing Gould and Yui gives an experience that couldn't be different. Gould haunches over, sings, conducts when he has a free hand, and is overall about as strange as a pianist can get. By comparison, Yiu looks absolutely normal, sane and inviting. Horowitz was many years past his wild days, mostly noodling in small scale works, save some Chopin and the closing Moszkowski. Combining the three gives a good sampling of some core piano repertory with very diverse ways of approaching the instrument.
Yui plays the Beethoven sonatas cleanly, musically, and with power when needed. The tempos all seem perfectly natural. The video captures her fingers in a way that adds a welcome dimension to the experience. Add her commentaries and an enjoyable short behind the scenes bonus, and this Bluray is a great addition to any collection, and can serve as your one Beethoven piano video if you just want one well performed sampling of the most popular sonatas. Combine this with Gould and Horowitz and you will have much to think about.",1421539200,,2030,4.90406976744186
8647732,5,B00J3HUFNS,"When I first watched and listened this DVD, I thought about what kind of people should own this. As a music lover, I was impressed by her beautiful clear tone, artistic passion and energy, and all intentions; although everything is natural and dramatic, also I could see her intentions... how she would have thought deeply each sonata as a craft of music. In this sense, this would be such an appealing product for a piano learner. As a piano teacher, this would be beneficial for serious teen age pianists as a educational DVD. I could imagine a family of music lover with their children learn piano would enjoy watching this DVD as a whole family.

Also her commentary is very attractive. It is interesting and show us the way that we can enjoy these sonatas. Her sincerity towards Beethoven's music, and interests inspire us to enjoy the music she plays in the DVD.",1414972800,2,868,4.673202614379085
8647733,5,B00J3HUFNS,"What an incredibly beautiful and powerful recording by Lisa Yui! I have heard Ms. Yui perform live on numerous occasions, and I was deeply moved each and every time. With many artists, I often don't enjoy recordings as much as their live performances because they feel too polished and lack some emotion. Not here! This truly captures the warmth and passion I have heard so many times in Ms. Yui's live performances. The ""Appassionata"" is a thunderstorm and the ""Moonlight"" is as moving as can be; however, it's the ""Waldstein"" where the magic happens for me.

Additionally, the commentary that comes with each piece is informative and enjoyable to listen to. I hope Ms Yui eventually makes a cd version of this so I can enjoy it in my car. If you love an expressive rendition of Beethoven, you'll find yourself listening to this recording again and again!",1410912000,2,856,4.783783783783784
