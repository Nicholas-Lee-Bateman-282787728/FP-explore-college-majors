8070532,3,B0009YNSLU,"This movie is mildly entertaining, a few pieces of footage are pretty good, but the majority seems like amateur photography---NOTHING like the Billabong Odyssey, which was jaw dropping incredible.  This one is ok if you've already seen the others like Step into Liquid and Billabong--otherwise-- go for Billabong!  You won't be disappointed at all, like I was with this Triple Crown of Surfing movie.",1269043200,,400,5.234375
8070533,3,B0009YNSLU,"I am disappointed in this video; I have many surfing videos that I love, but this is not one of them.  I think the music background is extremely annoying and the words to the music extremely offensive.  It ruined what could've been a good video.",1264032000,,245,4.4222222222222225
8070534,5,B0009YNSLU,If you like extreme surfing this is great. Some of those waves are huge and it is amazing that a person can surf these waves. It is interesting listening to what the surfers are saying about the contest and the waves.,1238544000,,217,4.317073170731708
8070535,1,B0009YNSLU,"First, why not make a documentry of the best from ALL of the past Triple Crown's, instead of just one, OK winter?!  Also, I can't watch this again because Sunny Garcia makes me ill.  He's the most unpleasant person in the entire history of surfing!",1138492800,5,248,4.488888888888889
8070536,5,B0009YNSLU,"The Vans Triple Crown of Surfing is like what the Stanley Cup is to Hockey, the Super Bowl to football, and Indy 500 is  to Cart Racing...Simply put its the mecca of surfing.

The crew at WINDOWSEATpictures captured the emotion, essence, and one of the  best contests in years on the N.Shore. The cinematography, in-depth interviews and the  drama of Sunny Garcia capture his 6th Triple Crown title was amazing. The edits were on point, the music just gets you psyched on wanting you to grab your board and hit the beach. If you are surfer this video is definitely worth checking out and keeping in the vault.",1129852800,2,609,4.611111111111111
