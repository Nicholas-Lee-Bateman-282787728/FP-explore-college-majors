8703105,4,B00TUB9T9I,"If you look at this as a ""Bound for Glory"" even then you'll be disappointed. However, if you look at it as a special TNA vs. Wrestle 1 show, or a TNA vs. Japan show then it's a very good show. Great matches all night long, X-Division title match was the best match of the night, EC3 was great, Manik's match was great, a very good show to watch. I'd say look at this more as a glorified ""One Night Only"" show because it was very good, just not Bound for Glory. (This is only a 1 disc set and the only extras are roughly 15 minutes of post-match interviews)",1429401600,,556,4.0636363636363635
8703106,4,B00TUB9T9I,"The Manik-Minoru Tanaka match was a pretty good darn good back-and-forth opener. The EC3-Ryota Hama match was a good comedy bout even though it wasn't meant to be that. The MVP-Kazma Sakamoto match was not great but alright. The Samoa Joe-Low Ki-Kaz Hayashi 3 way X-Division title match was a fun high-flying,hard-hitting showstealer. The El Hijo de Pantera/Andy Wu-Yusuke Kodama/Jiru Kuroshio tag team match was alright even though they were sloppy at times. The Team 3D-Tommy Dreamer/Abyss tag team was a fun hardcore,smash-mouth brawl and a good reminder of Team 3D's days in ECW. The Havok-Velvet Sky-Knocksout title match was awful this side of ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"". The Great Sanada/James Storm-Tajiri/Great Muta tag team main event was a solid tag team bout to say the least. I give this event a 7 out of 10.",1426118400,,830,4.935714285714286
8703107,3,B00TUB9T9I,"Normally Bound For Glory is pushed as TNA's biggest event of the year however they went a different direction this year with the event taking place in Tokyo, Japan at the Korakuen Hall in a joint ""live"" (one day tape delay in the United States) PPV event with the Wrestle-1 promotion leading to most of the various current ""Impact Wrestling"" feuds & championships (no World or Tag Team title defense) being put aside in favor of inter-promotional matches throughout the card (similar to WCW's Super-Shows with New Japan).  It should also be noted that TNA used the four sided ring for this event, highlights of Team 3D's TNA career & their Hall Of Fame ceremony were shown throughout the night, and Taz & Mike Tenay were calling the action from a studio instead of in the arena with Tenay reverting back to his ""Professor"" ways giving a lot of detailed information in regards to the japanese history & participants throughout the entire show as well.

Manik vs. Minoru Tanaka - They went back & forth with mat wrestling early on before one man was able to get an advantage working over the neck while his opponent gained momentum with a series of various dropkicks on the ground & in the air only for the opposition to respond with dropkicks of his own including from the springboard position as they traded momentum with some big kicks & moves such as a superplex armdrag combination in what was a competitive athletic contest.

Ethan Carter III vs. Ryota Hama - For those who've never seen Hama should know that's he's the japanese equivalent of Rikishi as far as his heavy size which EC3 decided to heavily mock only to be easily overpowered in response with Hama using his weight to his advantage along with embarrassing EC3 whenever possible while EC3 was able only able to get offense in when taking advantage of mistiming or resorting to desperate tactics leading to an average match with some comedic moments.

M.V.P. vs. Kazma Sakamoto - M.V.P. came out to a big pop based off his previous history in Japan (first I.W.G.P. Intercontinental Champion) while U.S. audience may remember Sakamoto from his brief time in WWE which M.V.P. joking mentioned while being in control early in the match causing Sakamoto to keep going to the ropes & outside to break the momentum eventually following him to the outside before Sakamoto was able to come back with various strikes along with even stealing a page out of M.V.P.'s playbook as they traded momentum throughout the match leading to a nice encounter that definitely saw a different showing from M.V.P. than we've seen previously in TNA due to the different environment.

X Division Champion Samoa Joe vs. Low Ki vs. Kaz Hayashi - It should be noted that this is the same Kaz Hayashi from the Yung Dragon's group in WCW over a decade ago.  Each man started off with strong strikes against each other such as strong kicks with Joe using his size to his advantage taking out both men all in the opening seconds as each man had attacked their opponents with strong kicks & chops to various areas of the body from different areas such as a springboard to aerial throughout the match along with other highlights such as one man powerbomb out of a corner into a submission, a double submission between all three men, and one man reversing a slingshot into a double foot stomp in what was a hard hitting physical match between all three men in what I consider the match of the night.

Andy Wu & Hijo Del Pantera vs. Kuroshio Ikemen Jiro & Yusuke Kodama - This was a special Wrestle-1 exclusive match with Jiro showing signs of Ric Flair with his ""styling & profiling"" by always showing off & fixing his hair down to even wrestling with his jacket on as Wu & Pantera showcased a lucha libre influenced style of high flying moves from either a springboard position or flying over the top to the floor including going over the referee at one point only to be matched by Jiro & Kodama going aerial as well with moves like a different variations of the moonsault as both teams executed some high impact moves like a tilt-a-wirl backbreaker, handstand head scissors takeover, and a move Mike & Taz didn't know how to call because they didn't know the area code in what was a real good match showcasing the promotion.

Team 3D vs. Tommy Dreamer & Abyss - Dreamer came out dressed as a tribute to Terry Funk & payed respect to Team 3D with a handshake while Abyss simply walked away as this started out with both teams delivering big moves only to get right back up from it causing one team to use the divide & conquer strategy focusing on one man while keeping the other out of the match before things eventually got out of hand with all four men brawling outside of the ring throughout the crowd using whatever they could get their hands on eventually making their way back to ringside with even more weapons being tossed into the ring to be used from chairs to kendo sticks to tables to Abyss' black bag of thumbtacks with the japanese crowd chanting throughout the entire match ""WE WANT TABLES...ECW! ECW! ECW!...HOLY S..."" resulting on the hardcore match expected from all four names involved.  As a side note, Team 3D's challenge to New Japan Pro Wrestling's Bullet Club was edited out of the broadcast.

Knockouts Champion Havoc vs. Velvet Sky - It should be noted that Velvet Sky came out as her babyface persona & not the current heel ""Beautiful People"" character that we've seen for most of the year as she attempted to use the strategy of ""hit & move"" using quick punches & kicks along with coming out the top rope from each corner of the ring before Havoc was able to eventually catch her & use her power to her advantage heavily working over the back with Velvet only able to get offense in whenever Havoc missed a big time move in a match that was very similar to her clashes earlier this year against Lei'd Tapa where it was a female version of ""David vs. Goliath.""

Yoshihiro Tajiri & Great Muta vs. Great Sanada & James Storm - Two of the most well known japanese wrestlers in america for the last quarter of a century teamed up here for revenge against Muta's former protege in Sanada & the man who transformed him in Storm with Muta & Tajiri giving quite the visual with their mist before the match as it started with ""student vs. teacher"" as both men focused on each others legs with grounded leglocks before Storm & Sanada used illegal tactics on more than one occasion to keep control for their team causing Muta & Tajiri to resort to those same tactics themselves as both team traded momentum both in & outside of the ring with one team resorting to their signature trademark offense while the other did some high flying of their own resulting in a good solid match with an aftermath of more than one associate of the participants getting involved.

As I stated earlier, normally Bound For Glory is the biggest event of the year for TNA however with their current situation & future of the company very questionable around this time that they went this direction to present their PPV as a special ""live"" experience with Wrestle-1 leading to completely different matches & audience to even the commentary that you wouldn't usually get which is a positive for this show with the big negative being that many of their top names & champions were unavailable to make the trip for one reason or another which did effect the star power & availability to have the best possible card and the quality of the card makes this my least favorite of their events from Japan.  In the end, if your looking for this show being their yearly ""WrestleMania"" then you will be disappointed but if your looking for a special event similar to their ""One Night Only"" events where it's a special unique one night show then I would check this out behind their previous events from Japan such as the ""One Night Only"" earlier this year & their Global Impact back in 2008.",1424390400,,7903,4.608386638237384
