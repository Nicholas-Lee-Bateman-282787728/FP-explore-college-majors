8276521,5,B001A9ZSIY,Malgudi Days is a fine and charming tv series about a small Indian town and it's residents.  However the Volume 2 set has dvd programming issues that make it fairly dysfunctional.  Make sure you get the full set which is well designed.  Well worth the extra cost.,1363737600,,263,4.553191489361702
8276522,5,B001A9ZSIY,I used to wait patiently to watch weekly episodes when Malgudi Days first aired on TV. I had been looking for the dvds for a while and so you can imagine my excitement when the boxed set went on sale! This is a true testament to Shankar Nag's genius and the timelessness of R.K. Narayan's characters.  As engaging as they were when I saw them for the first time...a pinnacle of achievement in Indian TV.,1347062400,,403,4.373333333333333
8276523,5,B001A9ZSIY,Amazingly very quick delivery. You will love this DVD. The serials in Malgudi days are authentic and beautiful. The direction by Shankar Nag is the best.,1316908800,,153,4.923076923076923
8276524,5,B001A9ZSIY,"Remember to buy Vol 1 of this two-volume DVD set with 6 DVD's dics in total.  You will find excellent reviews online if you do a quick search.  What I forgot to mention in my other Malgudi Days review is that the set comes with a little booklet that explains the series and the episodes.  This was my feedback for Malgudi Days - Vol 1.

I still remember as a child waiting for Malgudi days to come on Doordarshan, and now my kids love this DVD.  Considering that the show appeared nearly 20+ years ago, it still holds charm for the modern day kids, and closed captioning does help for those who do not speak Hindi.  An excellent purchase and a good set to have, if you have young children in the house.",1259712000,2,702,4.2406015037593985
