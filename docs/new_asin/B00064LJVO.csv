Rented it and thought cool it was going to be a werewolf movie or something like that and its nothing of the sort. It's a mundane, slow movie. Ugh! The documentary on Sci-fi channel about M.

2166525,4,B00064LJVO,"The cinematography and score help set a creepy and tense mood, but as a mystery thriller-horror flick, The Village is ultimately disappointing. The Village is primarily a love story, and secondarily a thought-provoking philosophical exploration of human tragedy. The plot is at times very dubious, especially after the signature Shyamalan Twist, but ultimately this is a very beautiful movie that deserves multiple viewings.

And honestly, the score is incredible.",1503964800,,464,5.72463768115942

More people rated this by their previous bias of M Knight Shamamamamnalan than rated this movie standalone. This movie came out when it was popular to hate him. People hated him and projected their hate on to the movie to sound more pretentious. But kids are generally less biassed than grown folks, depending on how brainwashed they are.

It stands out all the more in this day and age, when so many films rely heavily (and I don't mean this negatively) on their special effects, a lot of M.

2166539,5,B00064LJVO,"This is a brilliantly executed and directed film - concept, casting, cinematography, costume design and (something that doesn't begin with ""c..."") superb acting. The score was excellent. It was intellectually engaging and it provoked a surprising depth of emotion, leaving me with the taste of timeless mythology through a uniquely reflective lens. The reviews are polarized maybe because a film like this gleams its light in a way that doesn't catch everyone's eye at all times. Ive got no hate for the bad reviews - I think they show how much courage it takes for a popular director to stay within the flow of his abilities and continue to challenge himself. I think most people stayed the course of the whole film, whether they liked it or not, so I bet a sliver of it's depth is in there somewhere... However, I am a little confused as to how someone could not enthusiastically spend two hours of their life watching the magnitude of Bryce Dallas Howard's beauty illuminate her crazy acting skills... I mean... really... that wasn't enough for 2 stars?",1493769600,3,1056,4.8397790055248615

2166543,5,B00064LJVO,"As lots of reviews here testify, The Village is not a horror film. For a symbolist like myself, it's a stunningly perfect symbolic tale of redemption, of development towards wholeness.
Shyamalan uses his retro 19th C. setting, including archaic speech patterns, to place us deftly in another world; the world of our souls, in this case. In that world, we allow ourselves to feel more deeply the connection we all have to his ""red"" themes of innocence, passion, and intimate connection. In the same intimate inner place we also encounter the fear of love's loss and the fear of ""the towns"", a Village metaphor for the harsh and unforgiven cruelty and separation that hovers around the corner of even the most well-protected life. The main characters dramatize the touchingly complex struggle we might recognize in ourselves, the tussle between sticking to the well known regimen, those neatly ordered rows of cabbages in the screen frames, and the tangle and fear of the unknown, the woods beyond our wary boundaries.
As he does in Lady in the Water, Shyamalan offers us much beautifully crafted wisdom on matters of personal development. He educates us on the creation of our static, fearful condition. He characterizes for us our shadow selves and the creation thereof, the false ""those we do not speak of"", and the immature, frightened desperation of Noah Percy, played by Adrien Brody. Shymalan educates us too on the old baby-and-bathwater truth; we can't wall ourselves off from the red of pain and suffering without walling ourselves also from red's passion, needed for love, connection, and creativity.
Shyamalan uses the blind Ivy to clue us in on what might lie beneath our conditioned responses to the world; she does not see things in the ""normal' way- and neither does fearless Lucius. In one of countless beautiful symbolic bits, Ivy sees only light, sometimes, from certain people, and Lucius's name means ""light"". Together and in collaboration with Ivy's Dad, they will bring renewal to The Village, will prove that healing comes not from creating boundaries, though that can be temporarily important, but ultimately from connection and love.

2166554,4,B00064LJVO,"The story is borrowed from a book Running Out of Time by Margaret Peterson Haddix. It has been slightly modified for the screen by M. Night Shyamalan.

Everyone lives a full life in a self-sufficient 1800s village. We live in a symbiosis with a mysterious species. However we also live free form the evils that permeate those other villages beyond the forbidden forest. So what happens when we violate the truce with the other species?

The film is produced by M. Night Shyamalan; so there is no surprise in the formula or big picture. It is not hard to figure out the premise shortly into the story. However there are several surprising twists on the way.

The acting was surprisingly exceptional. We have well known actors that have the ability not to let their personalities overwhelm their characters.

The sets and period costumes were superb. You can see that there was a lot of time and money that went into them. You have the feel that you are there.

Although this film may not have achieved the potential in many eyes it is probably one of the best balance and almost believable stories Shyamalan has shown us. It is more than just a tale as we see how people relate and can relate under stress and great joy.",1485043200,,1219,4.573394495412844

Plot is pretty great, it can be a little slow if your'e used to fast-paced, shallow blockbusters.

2166570,5,B00064LJVO,"The Village is famous as a major misstep by M.Night Shyamalan, one of the most unfair assessments in recent  film history. it's a beautiful and haunting film when seen on its own terms, with a really good cast,  perfect cinematography and a haunting score. The problem was created by the Touchstone (Disney) Studio's promotion of the film as an out and out horror film to be taken on its face value. That might have made a great film too, but by drawing in an audience that was expecting something different they did the film no favors and it is underrate and unfairly neglected today. In defense of Disney's publicity people, I suppose they were thinking that by promoting the film as something that it wasn't, they would be making the Shyamalan ""twist"" more surprising, but it undermined the film instead.

I can't say too much more than that without ruining the film. It's depiction of an isolated village in the  late nineteenth century is as moody as its late autumn scenery. The love story it tells, and it is a love story really, is affecting and believable. Some people didn't like the seemingly over-stilted language (even for the 19th century) but  I think the director did that to show how removed these people were from everyday life. Adrien Brody as Noah Percy is frighteningly demented. Bryce Dallas Howard is convincing as the blind Ivy Walker, though you need to remember she has lived in the village all her life and knows her way around well. Joaquin Phoenix is stolid as Lucius Hunt, but  I thought they could have found someone a bit more charismatic for the role. But then, his matter of fact village boy might be just the type of character such a place would produce.

Look for Jesse Eisenberg in an early role as Jameson. He rarely is more than just another person at a village gathering but has one big moment playing a game with other boys by standing on a tree stump at the edge of the Village land with his back to the forest of the creatures .",1478304000,11,1971,4.56657223796034

2166606,2,B00064LJVO,"I tried to watch the Village a long time ago but thought it was boring and hard to follow then. I feel the same way now 12 years later.
The description's misleading.  Yes an element of the story is that creatures are lurking in the nearby woods of a small village located in the valleys and fields of Pennsylvania.  However this element is used only occasionally as the much bigger portion of the film focuses on a love story that involves Bryce Dallas Howard's character falling in love with Edward Walker.

Two major problems.  One is obvious- this can't be a scary movie if so much attention and detail is given on a man and woman falling in love and two, the presentation of the entire film goes for an elegant/stylish look which adds more to the love/romance story and consideraly less to the horror factor of the creatures in the nearby woods.  M. Night Shyamalan failed miserably trying to blend the two together because the love story overpowers the scariness... and trust me, they go all out trying to develop the ultimate love story.  The creatures in the woods are basically treated as only an occasional threat similar to a swarm of mosquitos that can't be swatted away for a little while.

There are times the movie tries to be legitimately frightening.  One is when the creatures (who wear red robes and look like an enemy from Resident Evil 4 the video game) come out of the woods and explore the town forcing everyone to hide inside their homes with the doors locked only for one woman to stand there with the door open welcoming the presence of the creature despite the potential danger, and two is when Bryce has to walk through the woods in search of medicine after Joaquin Phoenix's character is stabbed by Adrien Brody (who's WAY out of place in a movie like this- by a long shot) and thus encounters the monsters.  The movie goes for a failed jump scare with the scene showing the creature suddenly appearing behind a tree when the camera pans over, a trademark of M. Night Shyamalan.

So the moral here is that blending scary monsters and horror with an attempt to go all out and make the ultimate love story doesn't work at all.  It's a horrible combination.  I pretty much figured such an attempt wouldn't work before watching the Village but I guess this movie proves it.  It's really no different than trying to blend horror with comedy or comedy with drama.  Some genres should never blend together.

A shame the only moment that really made me feel uncomfortable is the very beginning watching the whole community of people sit around tables outside enjoying a feast and hearing strange sounds coming from the woods in the distance.  Everyone looks across the field to feel spooked with those sounds.  Clearly the most disturbing moment.  The movie should have focused more on why the people shouldn't ever walk into the woods.  Instead we occasionally see people approach the woods and quickly back away, or those who enter quickly return.  So much potential lost.  To put it simply- unusual creatures lurking in the woods are way out of place in a movie that focuses on love, so this is a bad movie.  Just focus on love and skip the creatures.  That would have been a much better idea.",1464825600,,3216,4.623239436619718

2166613,3,B00064LJVO,"I saw the Village on HBO and didn't think it was that bad.  I was really surprised at all the backlash and hatred for this movie.  It is far an away better than the Blair Witch Project and your average B grade horror flick.  But like others have mentioned its not really a horror movie at all more of a suspense drama.  I loved the cast and thought the acting was pretty good.  The overall story and plot was kind of so-so, there are a lot worse films out there than this movie.  Although you have to admit it is kind of a strange film similar to The Wicker Man.

I liked the idea of a society or group trying to shun the outside world and bring up their children in an innocent environment.  For some reason they reminded me of the Amish in many ways.  I enjoyed the movie and felt like I was the only one who did.  Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy did really well in my opinion.  Although I could see where this kind of movie would bore people to tears as well.  It is definitely not a film for everyone. I would rate it 3 stars its not terrible but not great either just kind of average.",1456876800,,1084,4.061320754716981
2166614,5,B00064LJVO,"I first saw this movie when it was just released on DVD.  I was working at the local Blockbuster Video at the time, and remember how people really disliked this movie.  I admit, when I first saw the movie I wasn't in love with it.  I thought the movie began with a decent premise, but didn't like how the movie progressed, and felt more disappointed with the ""twist"" ending.

Fast forward to 2016 - looking through the cable guide, I came across this movie one Friday night.  My companion had not seen the movie, so I figured I'd give this another try.  And I am really glad I did.  For starters, I think there was a certain level of disappointment when I first saw it - ""oh, another twist ending"" and feeling like since it was Shamaylan movie that every movie would wow me like The Sixth Sense.  But the second go around did wow me, for different reasons.  Without adding a spoiler to this review for those who have yet to see it, the twist really made me think about what could have led to what we find out - the thoughts, the emotions, what would drive people to this?

Am I looking to deeply into this?  Perhaps.  But the film is very well made, has an excellent cast and a stellar soundtrack that really sets the mood for the film.  If you have not yet seen this film, I would recommend a viewing.  If you have seen this but maybe not since it was first released, I would recommend giving it another try.  Not all movies are for everyone, of course.  But I think it took some time and a second chance to gain a better appreciation for the film.  This is the only M. Night film not on BluRay, but is available in HD to buy here on Amazon and on other sources.  Hopefully this will soon see a BluRay release.",1456444800,,1711,4.228395061728395

2166652,5,B00064LJVO,"I first watched The Village two years ago when I was twelve and loved it. I hadn't heard anything whatsoever about it before then, so I didn't have any expectations regarding the storyline. Contrary to what I believe most people expect prior to watching this film, The Village is not at all a horror film. It certainly isn't as scary as The Sixth Sense (which was Shyamalan's best work in my opinion), and in fact, isn't intensely scary. Aside from one prolonged very suspenseful scene about half an hour in, the movie moves slowly--but not in a bad way at all. I think the reason this film was frowned upon by critics was because they were expecting something this movie certainly is not. This is a drama about an isolated village in the middle of the woods, not a suspenseful horror movie.

The Covington Wood surrounds a settlement in 1897, as depicted by a tombstone in the beginning of the film. Everything seems idyllic: There is no need for any currency; everyone is neighborly, and, aside from the fact that the film opens during the funeral of a seven-year-old boy, everyone seems happy and content. But the viewer soon discovers everything is not perfect. For in the woods lurk Those We Do Not Speak Of-- viewed as both horrible creatures and guardian protectors by the villagers. The elders of the village have established what they call a ""truce"": we do not go into their woods, and they do not come into our village. The 'bad' color, red, must never be visible, for it attracts them. And heed the warning bell, for they are coming.

The movie brilliantly portrays the theme of oppression through fear and delivers an unexpected twist in the last five minutes. This is one of my favorite movies, and I hope this review changes the opinion of a would-be hater.",1436918400,20,1771,4.654952076677317

""To call it an anticlimax would be an insult not only to climaxes but to prefixes. It's a crummy secret, about one step up the ladder of narrative originality from It Was All a Dream. It's so witless, in fact, that when we do discover the secret, we want to rewind the film so we don't know the secret anymore. And then keep on rewinding, and rewinding, until we're back at the beginning, and can get up from our seats and walk backward out of the theater and go down the up escalator and watch the money spring from the cash register into our pockets.""

When it was first advertised years ago, there was no way I was going to watch it. I do not like horror films. So if that's what you're looking for, don't waste your time. I've actually heard that when it came out many horror fans were disappointed. However, if you like suspense and/or can handle a light thriller this is a must see.

The movie is great at building you up on the suspense and then when it reaches the point to surprise you the movie just laughs in your face. We see a group of people living a quiet non-violent existence on a friendly looking farm community out in Vermont somewhere. Of course there will be clashing of between characters to give dimension to the story but it's all part of M. Night's master plan. A formula that is overdone by this point.

2166680,5,B00064LJVO,"What people fail to see about this movie is that it's not about the surprise ending. M. Night Shyamalan gives a story with a message so profound that most people didn't realize it because they were too busy trying to figure out the twist. This film is a social commentary. Evil exists, and it will arise no matter how far you run from it. The Elders wanted to escape a world full of death, hurt, and overall misery brought on by the choices of others. There is no place you can run to that Evil cannot find. That is the whole underlying message. But the message is also that love will triumph even when the odds are against you. The score is by far one of the most beautifully crafted and sets the tone for the film better than most. So often films that present a deeper message are criticized for not entertaining the way we want. Most want to be entertained without having to put thought into what is going on. That just shows how lazy we have become. I loved this film and hold in high regard the way I do Citizen Kane and Ben Hurr.",1423612800,2,1035,4.232323232323233

2166691,4,B00064LJVO,"This was not a well liked movie.  The Village came out at a time when Shyamalan's popularity began to wane, and twist endings became a running joke.  I actually quite enjoyed this movie, even if I guessed the ending an hour and a half early.

If you're looking for a scary horror movie, you're already on the wrong page.  The Village is a well written and acted drama which plods along at a pace many might find too slow.  It takes its time developing its characters and telling its story.

There's an infuriating trend in recent movies where no shot lasts longer than a half second.  Directors seem to miss the concept - set up a good shot, let it linger just long enough to settle in.  There's a certain artistry to it, and Shyamalan seems to have achieved its mastery early in his career.

The principal cast all delivered stunning performances, in particular William Hurt, Bryce Howard, and Adrien Brody.  Oh man, Brody is totally believable as a mentally dispossessed cackling buffoon.

Costume designers also did a great job on this movie, and not just because it was a period piece.  The creature design was very creepy, and their blood red cloaks really catch the eye.  By contrast, the villagers wore mustard yellow cloaks, because the workers on this movie clearly spent time studying up on color theory.

If technical aspects of movies and solid performances by lead actors don't compel you to enjoy movies, then stay away from the Village.  It probably doesn't have much else to offer you.  Otherwise, enjoy.  Cheers.",1420156800,,1529,4.731060606060606

I get it. This is such an interesting idea; people, so paralyzed by fear of bad/evil in others, come together to create a secluded society that they think will never be touched by evil. They create a legend/lie to instill fear and to control the masses. Their fear keeps them from allowing trips outside of the boundaries to save or help others. Notice the lack of diversity? There's a lot to consider with this film.

And my take on the language/dialogue is that it is the language that would develop from modern day people trying to 18th or 19th century English. It wouldn't be accurate. This whole world they created is made up.",1419033600,,800,4.839416058394161

2166709,3,B00064LJVO,"Shyamalan is not one of my favorite film makers; however I thought this particular movie was one of his better works.

He did an excellent job of depicting life in what appears to be an early/mid 18th century colonial settlement like something out of a Nathaniel Hawthorne novel. He successfully draws the audience into this deception and the ending is, at first glance, an eye opener; however, this really stretches the limits of credibility.

how is it that this colony has remained so isolated and undiscovered all his time?
Are they actually known and simply ignored by everybody else?

Do certain village elders have in-out privileges like in a night club?

maybe I'm missing the point. Is this a village of ultra conservative Mayflower puritans or Amish type folk who have successfully and intentionally scared each succeeding generation into believing that the devil himself is waiting to ambush them beyond the borders of their isolated colony?

I know there have been tribes of so-called primitives discovered in the jungles of the Amazon and I'm guessing this is where he drew his inspiration from.

Maybe I'm simply not a big fan of his style of film making; like preferring a Wyeth painting to a Fragonard.",1415923200,2,1218,4.946078431372549

Night Shyamalan's The Village, the famed producer, writer, and director presents the audience with what is almost an adult fairy tale, complete with the small utopian community of 'good people living in the valley opposed by the ominous Those We Dont Speak Of creatures living near the community.  Seemingly self-sufficient, they have the necessities of life. The leader, Edward Walker (William Hurt), and his group of elders is the early focus of the movie, then the story resolves around the interrelationship between four young friends, excellently portrayed by Bryce Dallas Howard as the blind intrepid Ivy, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, and Judy Greer, and this quartet propels the movie to its conclusion and the true facts of the community. Also starring Sigourney Weaver, Cherry Jones, Brendan Gleeson, Jane Atkinson, and a brief acting turn by Charlie Hofheimer. The featured violinist of the James Newton Howard music score is Grammy-winner Hilary Hahn. Highly Recommended. Five MYSTERIOUS Stars! (Amazon Instant Video, PG-13, Color, Closed Captioned.

In trying to maintain ""innocence,"" the elders of this little clan can only maintain this illusion through fear and ignorance. Is it a wonder that the blind antagonist is one of the only ones not afraid?  It is her very inability to see that makes it possible for her to quell her fear until she is reminded that she must be afraid of the ""bad"" color. The reference to the ""bad"" color was interesting too, since it is this very color (red) that revels a death in the village, and later murder.

2166737,4,B00064LJVO,"I read a handful of negative reviews which all seem to miss the point of this movie.

The people of the village withdraw from society in an attempt to escape evil only to find that it exists among them. A jealousy fueled outburst of violence serves as an object lesson - our greatest problems are rooted within. Those who have not voluntarily isolated themselves are compelled to stay by deception and fear. Despite casualties, the movie concludes with the village's elders resolved to continue their society.

Hope for a brighter future is found in the younger generation. Children of two different elders, Lucias and Ivy, are both willing to brave the supposed terrors of the forest in order to save others - sacrificial love overcomes fear.

This film displays human capacity for evil and good. There is a portrait of hope painted on the dark canvas of depravity.

Granted, it doesn't have the best twist ending but it seems that Shyamalan is attempting to communicate something more here.

Bryce Dallas Howard and Adrian Brody (to a lesser degree) both turn in solid performances that are worth watching.
Also, the score, composed by James Newton Howard, is hauntingly beautiful and still stands as one of my favorites to this day.",1408147200,2,1235,4.889952153110048

The Village is a beautifully made film filled with amazon performances and just remarkable acting.  The storyline it's well thought out and the ending, though a twist is such a shock, one idea left going back over every aspect of the film to reexamine what they missed up until the end that hinted at the eventual ending.  And there are clues. Many of them. And once you see the film again you feel silly for missing them the first time.

Certainly every movie after The Village was inferior, disappointing, or just plain disastrous. The time period for The Village was set in the late 1800s. Everything was pitch perfect: the scenery, buidings, clothing, speech. The cast was full of major actors, any one of which capable of carrying a motion picture just on his or her name. The plot was very believable, even the monster was ""real"". The movie even had a ""spectacular"" ending. This is a scary movie. It will frighten small children maybe to the point of nightmares.

2166758,2,B00064LJVO,"""The Village"" is typical of all Shyamalan movies in that this movie was slow, had way too much suspense, and dragged on through the mud with occasional ""frightening"" moments here and there. Like other intelligent and sagacious reviewers and critics, I did not see the point of this pathetic movie since there's no way the village could isolate itself from the outside world when a town lives next door. Apparently, William Hurt's character fools everyone by putting on the ""creature"" costume to prevent the villagers from leaving the village. Anyway, the surprise comes towards the end of this slow movie (just like all other Shyamalan movies, such as the ever-so-popular ""The Sixth Sense""), that makes you wonder how in the world those villagers can live in that ""secluded village"".
1 star for the ""modern-day"" surprise (you'll get what that means) and 1 star for the ""creature"" costume that fooled the villagers.

If you wonder why I'm talking like a bablling fool, it's because I'm imitating the diolog from this horrible movie.

The movie was trying to be a brain twister that flipped the entire story upside down at the end with some mind blowing revelation.

(Spoiler alert...you've been warned. Or in this case...saved.)

After 2 hours of everyone from 1799 running around scared of monsters in the woods, it turns out they are from the modern era and just decided to live like Pilgrims because their loved ones died in a plane crash or something and they didn't want to face the reality of that. So all the victims' families moved into this goofy compound where they could all ignore reality together. I have no idea how churning your own butter somehow makes you forget that your kids died in a plane crash. But apparently this movie says it's supposed to.

But the mind bender at the end where they reveal it's actually 2005 or whatever year it is isn't a brilliant twist like in The Sixth Sense. In that movie the clues were there the entire time and you just overlooked them because our minds see what we want to see (which was the entire point of how the dead Bruce Willis couldn't see that he was dead, because his mind didn't want him to). That was brilliant! But the Villiage just tacks on a plot twist at the end that really has nothign to do with the rest of the movie, and we're supposed to think it's brilliant because of that.

At first, I just liked the ""feeling"" it gave me, of people trying to live in innocent appreciation of the simple bounty of life.  The scenes where they are all gathered outside to have a communal meal at the long tables are somehow very moving.  But the more I watch it, the more the beauty of this movie unfolds.  Lucius' bravery and unswerving love for Ivy; Ivy's joyfulness and strength in spite of her handicap; Edward Walker's hidden feelings for Alice Hunt, which will remain hidden because he will forever protect his wife and family against pain; and Edward Walker's determination that Ivy must go to the town on her quest, though it means risking everything they have built their lives around.

2166822,5,B00064LJVO,"Like a Renaissance miniature, ""The Village"" is a small masterpiece. Like a miniature, like any creation, it uses some artistry to make its statement; so yes, as a painting might use forced perspective or downplay certain details in favor of others more pertinent to the subject being depicted, ""The Village"" leaves some plot holes, allows some ends to remain loose and untied.  But the point of the film is not to create a perfect sub-creation: it is to depict the lives of a group of people (and in this case it spoke to my condition most profoundly) who have, seeing that it is impossible to win -- or even sanely exist -- in the game with which society has presented them, have chosen simply to give up, fold their hands, and leave the table.

In this, ""The Village"" succeeds triumphantly.

The cinematography (likewise filled with ""forced"" touches, most notably in the shot of Ivy standing in the forest surrounded by red flowers that, given the overall color balance of the frame, could not possibly be that red) is exquisite, the music breathtaking.  The whole film comes together as a symphony: cohesive, firmly held within the boundaries of its undertaking, visually and sonically beautiful.

And the ""plot twist"" at the end, once known, does not detract from repeated viewings.  So you know the secret.  What of it?  Here are people who, having made a difficult decision, move forward, determined to hold onto the last vestiges of innocence that they themselves, defying the world, defying fate, have grasped.

2166842,5,B00064LJVO,"Yes, the ""unexpected twist"" at the end is rather formulaic. But there are a few things that really propel the movie to the edge of great film. You just have to see it all unfold and think about it to see why. Initially the movie presents itself like a more or less conventional horror flick. It does wrap you up a bit with the plot and characters, but it also seems a bit far fetched and contrived. When it's over, though, and it settles in, you see that this is, perhaps, the ""truest"" horror movie ever screened. This is a story about people horribly wounded by the greatest monster of all - man unkind. Their responses (isolation, withdrawal, ""cult like"" behavior) are certainly among the major observed responses to the violence of the world today. The movie has a moral: our faults lie in ourselves and not in our stars. Maybe we've heard that before. Yes, but when taken all together, this movie adds a lot to the discussion of violence in the world today and our responses to it. Also, James Newton Howard's score and Hillary Hahn's rendition of it can rip your heart out - alone worth the ticket price.",1377561600,3,1109,4.4950495049504955

I don't own a TV, and just watch selected movies on the computer. So I'm not at all influenced by movie promotions and commercials or by interviews with movie people on talk shows. So my independent opinion of The Village is that it's an intriguing use of film as an artistic medium. Without any glitzy computerized effects, the director creates an atmosphere that gets his points across and arouses the emotions he wants to convey. It reminds me of how Alfred Hitchcock used film to do the same things. I thought the script was tightly written with each line and action making sense and nothing extraneous thrown in. I admired how the plot slowly builds to a surprising ending with each element revealing just a little more. I watched The Village a second time with my teenage daughter who is interested in film-making as a career. She picked up some good ideas.",1370995200,4,978,4.691860465116279

2166865,1,B00064LJVO,"Village is the film that, sadly, marked the downfall of M. Night Shyamalan's career. Shyamalan's previous films, The sixth sense, Unbreakable, and Signs I enjoy. The Village is the first Shyamalan film that really missed the mark, as would all of his following films. I think that this film, and all of his following films, is where Shyamalan's ego really got the better of him.

One thing I do like about this film is the premise. M. Night Shyamalan, if nothing else, really does have great imagination when it comes to the premises of his films, including this one. However, a premise is not enough. You need good execution that is where the film falls flat.

The characters are all wooden and boring. There was not one character that I was invested in. Because of this I found the movie very boring. The acting is awful as well. I do not think that anyone in the cast does a good job. Joaquin Phoenox is is this film as well. I dod not know what happened. I thought he did a fine job in Signs. However, here he was as dull as a rock.

The score did nothing for me. I remember nothing from the score of this film. The production values were nice I have to say. It is a good looking film with some creepy imagery at times. The design of the creatures were cool as well.

Overall this film had much potential that was sadly wasted. It looks good and has an interesting premise. However, there are no characters I cared about, and the acting was subpar at best. I'd have to say skip this one.",1368057600,2,1491,4.35251798561151

That is the only mindset you can have to enjoy this movie unless you ignore its entire fabric. That is what the lead ""Hall of Fame"" reviewer here did. Judging by his review I'd call it a ""Hall Of Infamy"". In his last paragraph he says, ""Early on in this film I decided what I wanted this film to be ..."".

2166898,4,B00064LJVO,"The Village is the sixth film written and directed by the now infamous M. Night Shyamalan. It was released in 2004 during his warm period, when he was still reeling from his successes with The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs and may have gotten a bit too cocky when making The Village, which is why it received mixed reviews from critics. Personally, I feel that The Village was a good film, it had likeable characters, it's wasn't boring, and it was at times dramatic and frightening, but I felt it would have been better if it had been handled a little differently. Considering that the Village is supposed to be a pastoral utopian community cut off from the negativity of the outside world, I feel that the film would have been more effective if the Village had been portrayed as a more beautiful, inviting place, and the protagonists and villagers themselves as happier, more content people. Instead the Village looks rather puritan, austere, dull and almost bleak, and the people tend to be more serious and reserved than they should be. The main characters, Ivy, Lucius, and Noah, portrayed by Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, and Adrien Brody respectively, all play their roles well, and I understand that Ivy needed to be blind and Noah mentally retarded for a reason, but I still feel the film should have been done differently to make it's message more effective. The characters all speak old fashioned, but there doesn't seem to be any real reason for this except to keep the twist ending from being revealed too soon. If this village existed in real life, the characters would all speak like modern people, because the descendants of the village elders would have no idea how people spoke in olden times and their parents wouldn't need to fool them into thinking they were really living in an earlier era. I feel that M. Night Shyamalan felt he needed to provide a twist ending so he made the film progress the way it did. I understand why the trailers advertised the film the way they did, because if you really think about it, they couldn't do it any other way without giving away the twist, and this is one of the reasons why I feel that Shyamalan made this film less than what it could have been by feeling the need to add the twist ending. He could have played it from the perspective of the ""elders"" and the sacrifices they made keeping their children pure and innocent. Overall, I applaud M. Night Shyamalan for creating such a unique film, especially nowadays, this almost seems like a film Ingmar Bergman would have created. We need more films similar to this, and less like Superbad, Gummo, and Mean Creek.",1358899200,2,2637,4.697624190064795

That is, until the end, when the mystery and suspenseful atmosphere are ruined by a childish realization or conclusion. This film is the perfect example. I'm not gonna tell you the ending in case you decide to watch this, but I will say that the movie is pretty darn good until then. The whole time we are led to believe that something dreadfully scary and evil is lurking. At the end when the truth is revealed Shyamalan makes us feel like a bunch of suckers. He pulls this crap all the time. In Signs, we are led to believe that the aliens are frightening. When we finally see them, they look like those inflatable green martian toys. In Devil we fear that Satan walks among us. In the end, it's an old lady. The Village has a similar ending. All of his movies are awesome until the truth is revealed. Then the ending just makes the whole thing seem like a waste of time. I feel like he's watching and making fun of me for sitting through over an hour of his bull crap. That is just my opinion though.

After 2 weeks I decided to check it out one more time before I ""get rid"" of the dvd. I fell in love HARD with ""The Village""! I took it all in and it hit me like a ton of bricks. This movie is amazing! I was so in love I watched the movie almost every night, after school, for the next 2 weeks. It's just fantastic story telling which I know all to well - most people won't get!

Most of all this movie taught me a valuable lesson. Never judge a movie to harshly the first time out! Since then I have been very careful to follow this philosophy closely. I ran into this same issue more recently with ""Avatar"". It is such a visual feast I didn't pay as much attention to the story as I did to the CG effects. The entire forrest down to the dirt is computer generated by the way. I happen to be a computer animator so that may have something to do with my being so distracted.

I can tell you, however, there is no Kool-Aid involved in the ending.

The elders have identified an outside threat from which the village must be defended and the members of the community are never allowed to forget the dangers lurking outside. Although they understand there are towns outside, these towns are places of evil which must be avoided.

The storyline of the movie is based on a need to dare these dangers in order to bring in some needed supplies from outside. The one that circumstances elects just happens to be blind so that further complicates the journey. Some interesting plot twists are revealed which helps make sense of the overall situation; the viewer begins to get background information which explains what has happened in the past that helped shape the village into what we see during the movie.

There is some good suspense built up with the settings and the acting contributing to the whole process. I found it difficult to relate to any of the characters and had some difficulty really caring what happened to them. It was sufficiently involving to hold our attention all the way to the end but we will likely not want to watch is again.

2166924,5,B00064LJVO,"Do you all know M. Night Shyamalan? He writes and directs the most incredible movies. I've only seen one before, ""The Woman in the Water,"" and I loved it. As you can see by the stars, I loved this one, too.

The Village is in a valley surrounded by woods, and there are monsters in those woods: those of whom we do not speak. There is a sort of contract with the monsters: the people in the Village do not go into the woods, and the monsters do not come into the Village. But the agreement has been violated, and terrible things begin to happen.

A few of the citizens of the Village are especially important to the story, but I must not tell you much about the ways in which they are important. Edward Walker is one of the elders, and seems to be rather the leader of the elders, at least as ""first among equals."" The thing is, although they dress very simply, rather like Mennonites, there does not seem to be any special religious aspect to the Village. They came there to get away from the wickedness of the towns, but none of it is very specific.

Ivy Walker, Edward's beautiful daughter, is blind. Perhaps that is the reason she has more courage than the rest of the Village; she's had to take risks just to get around.

Lucius Hunt is just about the only other person who does not seem afraid, so of course he and Ivy fall in love. Naturally.

But there's one more person who matters to the story: Noah Percy, who is some kind of crazy. He's not simply retarded, although perhaps autistic would be accurate. In any case, he's the one who laughs and invites the monsters in rather than being afraid. Or maybe he's afraid, too, but he laughs and invites them in.

Gradually we learn that almost everyone among the elders lost a loved one to violence in the towns, and that's the main reason they came to the Village.

From here, anything I say might give away the artfully crafted plot, and I do not want to do that. You may suspect, but you will not know what is going on until very near the end. And by that time, how it will play out is every bit as important as what the big secret is.

It would make so much more sense if the father just went and got the medicine, keeping his daughter safe. The oath is more important than his daughter's life? M. Night Shymalan often makes these leaps of logic in his films, but this is one of those ""Oh, come on!"" moments. But still, I enjoyed the movie.

2166930,5,B00064LJVO,"This is a far deeper and better-made movie than most people give it credit for. People seem to come to it after seeing The Sixth Sense, and expect that the driving force will be the plot and its surprise twists. But just as Signs included a couple of surprise twists while really being driven by the main character's internal struggle, The Village is really not about the  twists - even though there are several major ones. It's really more of a ""return to Eden"" story, where imperfect people seek to live free from the world's evil influences and discover the evil isn't just a product of a flawed society - it's in them too. In a sense, it's about original sin.

I've watched this film several times, and even knowing what and where the twists are, and the surprises no longer surprising me, I still appreciate it. There's a good deal of subtle detail, including some symbolism of M. Night's own making. The two symbolic colors (the safe and peaceful goldenrod, and the ""bad color"" red) are an obvious example. Red he used earlier in The Sixth Sense as signalling the presence of the dead, but here its significance is more nuanced. As shown in the opening scene, the evil springs up on its own, like a wildflower. In other scenes, it evokes evil and crime which will not stay hidden or confined, and which we can't hide from behind walls, because it's in our blood.

The storytelling and cinematography are very good. Although the first few scenes might suggest a serene, nearly Amish tranquility and simplicity, death and sorrow enter early, and the odd burial of the red wildflower tells us this is not the world we know. There is a tense nighttime visit by ""those we do not speak of"" that terrifies most of the village - but not everyone - to the point that they shiver in their cellars, accompanied by a rich soundtrack. This is followed shortly by an understated love scene when the blind seer Ivy is startled awake only to find the tongue-tied Lucius sitting as sentry on her porch. Their conversation, shot mostly in profile, is quietly eloquent.

The acting is strong throughout, even in the smaller roles and bit parts, which is generally (but sadly not always) true of M. Night's films.

The plot is admittedly far-fetched. If you're inclined to find fault with the writing because you want everything explained, or you expect the characters to do the kinds of things you would do in their position, you'll find much to criticize. At the same time, even though much of the premise is left to the imagination, it's not illogical or impossible. Though something of a fantasy, it doesn't go so far as to become simply a morality tale - it's still a story about real people, their motives, and their choices.

If you watch this film expecting suspense, surprises, and nothing more, you might say either ""I saw it coming a mile away"" or ""Where did that come from?"" (I've heard both.) If you take it on its own terms, as a movie with a few improbable elements but essentially about the human struggle with our nature, you may be very pleased. I realize this movie isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it's my favorite among all M. Night's work.",1326844800,3,3147,4.610714285714286

It has an excellent cast of characters played by Hurt, Weaver, Phoenix, Brody and let us not forget Bryce Dallas Howard - the daughter of Ron Howard.  It is an original story that could be taken right out of the headlines of the 6 o'clock news.  It is a light thriller with a great story and I don't think it falls apart at the end at all.  It is also a fantastic love story of sorts with unique characters not often seen in movies...(blind young women and Noah, a special needs individual).

2166932,2,B00064LJVO,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

To be uncharacteristically succinct, I think ""The Village"" was an inept blend of ""The Truman Show"", ""The Twilight Zone"", ""The Prisoner"", and ""Scooby Doo"" (the elders would have gotten away with it too, were it not for the meddling kids Lucius and Ivy). Admittedly, its themes of secure utopia (and the lengths people will reach to preserve it) and the ""woods as labyrinthine hell"" metaphor were intriguing and thought-provoking, but I felt M. Night Shyamalan's framework for presenting these themes was too contrived, attenuated, silly and inconsistent to be effective. As a 30-minute ""Twilight Zone"" episode, the premise would have had more shocking impact. As a feature-length movie, it appeared amateurish and pretentious instead, with too many plot and logic holes. Perhaps Mr. Shyamalan should have presented his themes in a straightforward way, without ""the past is really the present"" or ""it was Earth all along - god damn you all to hell"" twist, and really achieved the ultimate twist of having no twist.

One can forgive a movie's lapses in logic if they are infrequent and the movie is basically intelligent and entertaining, but I felt ""The Village"" is truly neither. The dialogue is self-consciously excruciatingly stilted, the characters' actions stupefying (i.e. Lucius has been stabbed twice in the abdomen; his life is dribbling away, will SOMEBODY get the medicine already? and ""Ivy, get down in the cellar already?""), the ""monsters"" shoddily anthropomorphic and the ending inert. I did like the atmosphere and cinematography, however, but it was small compensation for this ""house of cards"" movie. To play devil's advocate for a moment, perhaps Mr. Shyamalan deliberately and perversely made his movie imperfect to inspire thoughtful commentary and discussion (is THIS the ultimate twist?)

Now I present a list of plot/logic lapses designed to prompt ""You Gotta Be Kiddling Me"" responses:

1. Could even a billionaire arrange to prevent airplanes from flying over the woodlands preserve?

2. Those poles the villagers were painting the mollifying color yellow sure looked like telephone poles.

3. Would you put a monster suit in a cellar where the village idiot would have ready access to it?

4. Would any rational, humane person send a blind girl (no matter how stereotypically pure and resourceful, since of course blind people are always above reproach, unflinchingly brave, and possess extrasensory perception - is she Daredevil's daughter?) alone into the woods for medicine? That is cruel and unusual punishment violating the 8th amendment!

5. To protect the ""idyllic"", ""pristine"" village from the encroachment of evil civilization, wouldn't you need an army of security personnel? Only one appears in the movie and, even though he's apparently a novice, he seemed useless.

6. Cut off from the outside world, how can the village sustain itself for any period of time? Wouldn't the inhabitants go mad being restricted to the village limits? Curiosity will ultimately surmount fear.

7. As my friend Joe Flynn, who watched the movie with me, said, ""Wouldn't some stoned teenagers trespass into the woodland preserve and stumble upon the village?"" Exactly.

Still, in its klutzy way, ""The Village"" does stimulate thought, which is more than you can say for many movies that are otherwise more efficient and entertaining!",1324425600,3,3388,5.267161410018553

2166935,3,B00064LJVO,"SPOILER WARNING! SPOILER WARNING! SPOILER WARNING!

""The Village"" isn't a real horror movie, but a slow paced science fiction drama. The plot is set in a peaceful, Amish-like village in 1897. The village is ruled by a group of benign Elders (both male and female), and everyone lives a simple, happy, rustic lifestyle.

As the story progresses, it becomes more and more obvious that something isn't what it should be. The Elders have dark secrets, and bizarre creatures in red caps occasionally attack the village and its inhabitants. Nobody is allowed to leave the premises. Indeed, almost nobody wants to leave, fearing the supernatural creatures in the woods.

The leading Elder, Edward Walker, eventually reveals to his daughter, the blind Ivy, that the entire community is based on a lie: the monsters scaring the inhabitants to remain in the village are the Elders in disguise! The final plot twist reveals that the film is actually set in the present day (2004) and that the village is a kind of cult which has deliberately cut itself off from civilization. The ""dangerous"" woods are part of a wildlife preserve, owned by Walker himself. The movie ends with Ivy returning to the village after visiting the outside world. Since Ivy is blind, it's unclear how much she has understood of the situation, and she opts to keep the secrets her father has already revealed to her. The strange community is allowed to continue.

I'm somewhat ambivalent towards ""The Village"". The movie does get too tedious at times, the twist ending would be part-incomprehensible without the Wikipedia exegesis, and the plot is illogical even for a science fiction production (I only told you the good parts!).

Yet, ""The Village"" has *something* that makes it tolerable, even good (after a fashion). I'm not sure what, though. Perhaps it's Ivy, perhaps it's the fact that the Elders are tragic rather than evil, or perhaps it actually is the twist ending. I mean, the idea isn't bad! I always get fascinated by science fiction movies on the ""fake world"" theme, such as ""The Matrix"" or ""The Island"". Perhaps I subconsciously suspect that our world *is* a big fake, and that somebody somewhere is hiding something?

I really don't know how to rate ""The Village"". Both two, three and four stars are options. When the film is at its most tedious and illogical, it definitely goes down to a two. The twist ending itself is worth four. As a compromise, I give it three stars. And  yes, ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" were better...",1313193600,2,2514,4.887323943661972

Most of the jump scenes are average, the music is unlikable, the acting is stiff, and the twist ending isn't very shocking. The eerie atmosphere throughout the film is effective, however. Sigourney Weaver and Adrien Brody give very good performances. The look of the film is stellar, and the costumes and sets are fairly decent. All in all, it's just an average horror film.

It is about what fear can do to people.  Even when there are no monsters they become real when they are created in our minds.  That's where they have the most power to affect us.  Movie thrillers of the past new how to use this fact.  They didn't need to have blood splattering everywhere or to actually show a psycho beheading someone.  They (namely Alfred Hitchcok) just had to create the idea of these things happening to terrify.  That way everyone's own imagination will create their own nightmare.

It evolved into more of a love story than anything else.

I think this film is clever, witty and interesting.  The flirty banter between the two main characters is great.  The scenery is beautiful.  The acting is absolutely superb.  I particularly enjoy William Hurt's performance.  The tone of the film that Shyamalan creates is even and consistent throughout.

2166972,5,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan (hereafter referred to as Night) has got himself into pickle, and I suppose maybe it's his own fault. Many people are going into his movies with the single-minded purpose of figuring out the ""twist"", and in the process are not paying enough attention to grasp the more important things. In a sense Night reminds me of the guitarist Buckethead, whose genius shines through the presence of a KFC bucket turned upside-down and an expressionless white mask, at least for those who can look past the bucket and realize that it's irrelevant and only a problem for those who insist on seeing the gimmick instead of listening to the music. Night is known for this gimmick of the surprise ending, and people are ignoring the virtues of his films because they are too focused on the gimmick.

**This review will contain spoilers so please read no further if that is an issue for you.**

Okay. There are two major revelations in this film, one of which occurs late in the film and the other which occurs at the end. The first revelation, that the creatures -  ""those we do not speak of"" - are not real, is something which I more or less assumed early on. I immediately made a connection with these creatures and the myths of religion. I admit that I didn't know that this myth of the creatures was fabricated by the village elders. Many people consider this a silly premise, even a preposterous one, but given that we live in a world where our ancestors (our elders, if you will) actually have fabricated a massive lie about a mysterious realm populated with demons and a real-live Satan to boot, I find it completely plausible. Not only plausible, but entirely realistic. History is full of efforts by well-intended groups of people to isolate themselves and their loved-ones from the outside world by creating micro-utopias and religious and/or ideological communes of one sort or another. Why people have difficulty accepting this premise is completely beyond me, especially since the film goes to great lengths in exposing the inherent flaws in similar premises and why they almost always fail.

The second revelation (or ""twist"", if you must), which is that the film takes place in modern times, is almost entirely irrelevant and adds nothing of great importance. It changes nothing. We already know everything we need to know by the time this revelation occurs, and the story is all but finished. We already know that this community has isolated itself from the outside world because of the disillusionment and fears of those who created it, because of the wild hope that their new world will be purer, better, and safer. When I saw the modern vehicle pulling up to Ivy, the blind girl who is the hero and central character of the film, I wasn't racked with any great surprise. It was a ""meh"" moment. I didn't care much, to tell you the truth. All I cared about was if the driver of the vehicle could help Ivy complete her mission. That's it.

And why is that? Well, because one of the things this film is is a love story, and a triumphant one at that. Ivy is in love with Lucius Hunt, and he is in love with her, and he needs medicine to survive two stab wounds given to him by another person who also loves Ivy, but with a different kind of love, as Lucius is about to explain before being stabbed. As anyone who has seen enough of Night's films knows, or should know, Love, with a capital ""L"", runs like a bright thread through all of them (at least the ones I've seen).  Romantic love, familial love (the deceased mother and living daughter in Sixth Sense: two words to remind you of one of the most moving scenes in movie history: ""Every day""), and deep, spiritual love (with and without the religious connotations). It bugs me to no end that in all the criticism I've read about Night's movies, so much is written about the damn ""twist"" and so little about the power of Love. What's especially touching about Ivy's love for Lucius is the way she has to draw him out, to make him speak his feelings. She is the great strength in the community, despite being blind, and the scene on the porch where she gets Lucius to confess his love for her is one of the most satisfying scenes I've ever watched in any film. Adding to the poignancy of this unspoken love is what is going on between Alice Hunt and Edward Walker (Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt). Lucius is speaking at one point to his mother, Alice Hunt, and mentions that Edward Walker is in love with her. She asks her son how he knows this, and he replies, ""Because he never touches you."" Again, a hair-raising line and a magnificent reflection on what it's like to harbor feelings of love for someone and not be able to tell them, a feeling with which I am painfully familiar.

Early on there is a scene which stands in stark contrast to all of this: a scene where Ivy's sister confesses her love for Lucius Hunt boldly and without restraint. It's an early reminder that no matter how we try to insulate the people we love from being hurt, our efforts will very often - if not indeed always - go for nothing. The scene serves to remind people that the dangers of the world do not merely consist of evil people or evil creatures with dark intentions. Even Love can be dangerous, and in fact often is. Not only dangerous, but fatal. Enter one of the other pivotal characters, Noah Percy. Noah has some sort of mental deficiency and his behavior is often reckless and erratic. Ivy Walker is about the only one who seems to have a calming effect on Noah. She has power over him, and only later on do we realize that Noah has his own deep feelings of love for Ivy, feelings which become a dark and dangerous force equal to that of any evil mythical creature. Noah is the person who stabs Lucius, because Lucius threatens Noah's relationship with Ivy. It's not for nothing that Night has Noah dress up as one of the Covington Woods creatures in order to terrorize Ivy on her painstaking trek through the woods to the ""towns"" and frustrate her efforts to bring back medicine to save Lucius. He is showing how even innocence and love can be corrupted into something deadly and evil, and why we don't need to invent supernatural agents of terror, nor even supernatural agents of Love, for that matter, since the very real and natural Love that we are capable of as mere humans is sufficient to make us do virtuous and heroic things (as well as terrible things). This reminds me of a wonderful few lines spoken late in the film by Edward Walker, when he and the elders are beginning to realize that their utopian dreams may have been somewhat misgiven (I am paraphrasing, and may not have it exactly right): ""Love moves the world. The world bows before love, in awe.""

To sum up, the Village is a film which offers many things to think about: is religion a good thing after all, can any utopian system actually work, is it a good idea to smother our loved ones in good intentions and keep them from living full, normal lives, and can love really save the day, when all is said and done? I believe it can. Thanks, Night, for this great and thought-provoking piece of work.",1272844800,2,7138,4.540792540792541

2166975,3,B00064LJVO,"This review that I had written years ago for an online newspaper is based on the film not the DVD and its features:

To start off with, I don't think the premise in ""The Village"" is bad one. The idea is quite interesting, but it's the way the story is presented that bothers me. I can't say much on that at this point of the review without giving a way the ending. Critics have been savaging this movie for cheating audiences with a gimmicky twist. While I do feel cheated in some ways, I feel that if the movie had explored other angles, it could have been a much better movie.

The movie begins in a quaint, isolated village of the late 1800s. The people live quiet, simple lives free from the evils of the outside world, which they refer to only as the ""Towns."" They are not free, however, from fear. For outside their lovely, peaceful village lurk horrible creatures that live in the woods and do not suffer trespassers.

The villagers refer to these creatures as ""Those We Don't Speak Of"" though they seem to speak an awful lot about them throughout movie so the name seems a bit inappropriate. Perhaps the villagers should have called them ""Those We Sometimes Speak Of"" or ""Those We Actually Speak of Quite Regularly"".

Apparently ""Those [They] Don't Speak Of"" have some kind of pact with the villagers though it's never explained how it came about. It's not like you could have a sit-down meeting and negotiate an agreement with creatures you don't speak of. Perhaps these creatures can be spoken ""to"" just so long as they are not spoken ""about.""

The pact, anyway, is simple and straightforward: villagers don't go into the woods and the creatures don't go into the village. Oh, and the creatures are attracted to the color red, which the villagers call by ominous name: ""the bad color"". The villagers make sure there is nothing red anywhere in the village. For some reason, yellow is fine by them so the villagers wear yellow when they go walking near the forest or when they go on guard duty.

For creatures that aren't spoken about, the villagers worry about them a good deal. The villagers burn torches at night on their perimeter and they keep a guard on duty in a tower. They also paint yellow streaks on the torch stakes that supposedly is to ward off the creatures. The expense of keeping these torches lit should be reason enough one would think to attempt a pre-emptive strike against these creatures before they run out of wood and yellow paint. In addition for defensive purposes, one would think a wall would be far more effective than a few torches and a bucket of yellow paint.

One of the villagers named Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) thinks it's possible to go into the woods and even to the ""Towns"" if a person is brave and has an honest purpose such as procuring medicine for the village. The Elders, a group of the original settlers that administer the town, dismiss this notion. The Elders are the only ones who have seen the ""Towns"" where each of them lost family members due to violence. They are reluctant to have any contact with the outside world again. Plus there are those creatures that might rip them all up if they go into the woods [insert a slight snicker here].

Eventually someone gets injured and medicine from the ""Towns"" is desperately needed. A party is organized to go into the forbidden woods and to the world beyond. Edward Walker (William Hurt), the de-facto leader of the Elders, plans to go himself but another Elder reminds him of the oath he once swore that he would never go back to the ""Towns."" So instead he sends his blind daughter Ivy, played by Bryce Dallas Howard.

This makes perfect sense: send someone who can't see through a forest full of unspeakably horrible unspoken-about creatures and hope they will take pity on her. Then if she makes it through the forest, she will have to deal with the ""Towns"" where she has never been to before nor has any experience with. She's liable to wind up like many country bumpkins do when they go to a big city for the first time: get swindled or outright robbed.

Director M. Night Shyamalan's signature twist to the ""The Village"" is ultimately what kills the film. Too much of the film is wrapped up in delivering the twist and keeping the audience clueless until the end; by the time we get there we feel cheated out of a movie. The twist here is too much of a gimmick and doesn't work the way it did with ""Sixth Sense"" (1999) and to some degree ""Unbreakable"" (2000).

Shyamalan is effective, though, in creating an atmosphere of suspense and fear at the beginning of the movie. It's just unfortunate that the twist sabotages this promising beginning and creates more than a few plot holes that threaten to swallow the film whole. It's a twist that likely to bring more groans than gasps.

=========SPOILER ALERT==========
If you haven't seen the film read no further!!!
============================

There are no monsters. There never have been. There never will be unless you want to count the Elders as monsters for having lied to their children and grandchildren for over 20 years.

The monsters are a fabrication created to keep the younger generations from wandering into the woods and finding out that they have been living in a National Park all this time.

Apparently the Elders did not abandon the modern society of the 1870s but rather the 1970s. Fleeing violence, disco and polyester leisure suits, the Elders decided to create a Utopian society for themselves away from the world and shag carpeting. Hurt's character it turns out used to be a Professor of American History and Folklore. He came up with the idea of an Utopian Village set in the past and the ""Those [They] Won't Speak Of"" to protect the illusion.

This is why the twist ruins a good story. It would have been far more interesting to dwell on the Elders' decision to keep the village's future generations in the dark about the outside world. The village is a sham supported and protected by another sham. Sooner or later someone is likely to stumble across them or simply fly over in a Cessna. The preserve that the villagers live on is surrounded by a wall and guarded by Forest Rangers but that isn't enough to stop potential curious trespassers.

And how would the younger generations feel towards the Elders if they found out they had been living in abject fear all their lives for nothing? What would happen if they found out their parents had been lying to them for all these years just to maintain an illusion built for their comfort and solace? Not too mention that their parents are responsible for their neurotic life-long aversion to the color red?

There are many different angles this story could have been approached by that might have made for a more interesting film.

For one thing, I wanted monsters. I know whole point is that there weren't any monsters but I think a better storyline in this regard could have been either:

1) The monsters did exist and were either brought into existence by the power of belief of the villagers -- much to the shock of the Elders -- or the creatures had always existed and were somehow awoken by the villagers;

or

2) One of the Elders who had either left the village a long time ago or everyone thought dead has gone insane and is living in the woods believing himself to be one of the creatures, thus obeying the rules the Elders made; or it's one of the Elders in the village that has gone schizo and on some nights attacks villagers and livestock.

Either way, it would have been better than having the village idiot, played by Adrien Brody, bumbling around in one of the costumes -- which he just happens to find a little too conveniently. He looked like he could barely get his clothes on by himself much less one of those costumes.

The monsters being real would have made for a more ironic twist on the Elders who in creating a legend to keep people from going into the woods now actually have something in the woods to be afraid of. The story could have been that the creatures have become so dangerous that the village's only hope is either to escape or bring in help from the outside.

I think that could have made for a poignant point: that the very thing the Elders fabricated to keep the village together becomes the very thing that threatens to destroy it because the village is a lie supported by another lie. In the end, the illusion of the village can't last and the lie threatens to destroy them all.

Since there are no creatures, however, the rituals for dealing with them come off as far too elaborate (not to mention ridiculous). The Elders must have sat up late many nights coming up with all these rules while they were also trying to figure out how to farm, sew, slaughter livestock and bribe major airlines from flying over.

It also becomes staggeringly apparent that it would have been a heck of a lot easier for Hurt or one of the other Elders to have gone to the ""Towns"" and got the medicine. They would have been more familiar with the outside world as opposed to their century-handicapped children. The bit about the oath mentioned above just doesn't seem like a strong or convincing enough reason for Hurt not to go. The oath seems more like a deliberate tool used by the writer/director to send the blind girl in order to heighten the suspense.

Hurt does reveal to his daughter out of fatherly love that the creatures don't exist but he says, almost reassuringly to the audience that wants monsters, that there are legends that say these creatures once existed. Hurt reveals to her a costume of the creatures hanging in a shed that the daughter calls, with dread in her voice, the ""Shed We Don't Use.""

At this point I realized ""The Village"" suffered from a lack of imagination when it comes to naming things. With names like ""Those We don't Speak of,"" the ""Towns,"" and the ""bad color,"" it makes me wonder what other corny ominous-sounding names they have for things in the village. ""This is the 'Fork We Do Not Use For Salad'"" ""That is the 'Shirt We Do Not Wear At Grandmother's.'""

Hurt's revelation is the worst part of the film. Finding out that it's really modern time wasn't as crushing a blow to me as finding out the creatures were fake. The explanation he gives really doesn't wash and it feels as though all the noises and brooding atmosphere of rituals and ""bad colors"" are there just to keep the audience in the dark so as to surprise and shock them later.

==========================================

Overall, I give ""The Village"" 3 out of 5 stars. The acting is believable though a bit wooden. The atmosphere is creepy and brooding. It's the twist and the missed opportunities that film could have taken that bring what could have been a more interesting film to a disappointing climax.",1264723200,7,10775,4.610443864229765
2166976,5,B00064LJVO,"This film is so well done.  I am not a big fan of M. Night...however, this was a very thought provoking film.  There are many times when I've wished to just run away, to get away from what I consider the ills of our society, but I think in the long run, as this movie shows, you can't escape by running away.  Life is what it is and pretending doesn't change that.  There is good and bad everywhere, even in an idealistic hidey-hole like The Village.  Give this one a try.  It will leave you thinking.",1264464000,,501,4.166666666666667
2166987,3,B00064LJVO,"'The Village' is the exact point where M. Night Shyamalan started losing his mojo. By this point, 'The Sixth Sense' had become a bit of a millstone around his neck, and Shyamalan clearly felt pressured to deliver the ""twist ending"" yet again. But unlike his previous three films, his trademark twists and turns are badly bungled, and they end up ruining a film that would have been much better off without them. The film actually relies on a succession of ""revelations"", but once the first one is known, you can pretty much guess what the others will be. So the entire second half of the movie (including the Really Big Revelation) is simply confirmation of what you already half-expected, making it a big let-down.

It's a shame really, because the basics of the film are pretty good. The main cast, especially Bryce Dallas Howard as the blind heroine Ivy and Adrien Brody as the disturbed (and disturbing) Noah, are good in their roles (although William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver are a bit wasted). And Shyamalan does a reasonable job of setting the period and mood, giving the first act a brooding, slightly Gothic quality. The film actually would have worked much better had it simply continued as a straight period piece, as concept of the creatures attacking an isolated village is a great premise for Gothic horror. There was simply no need to throw all these (fairly predictable) curveballs at the audience, and to turn the film into something completely different.

Unfortunately, it seems Shyamalan was stuck in a rut by this stage, and could only fall back on the same old tried-and-true ""twists"" he's done before. The interesting setup, and some of the performances, keeps this from being a total disaster, but it's fair to say that `The Village' is one of his weakest.",1261612800,,1781,4.836065573770492

 Directed and written by M. Night Shyamalan.

  As the story begins, the year is unknown for now.  A community of pilgrims have a situation where something is killing little animals ripping off their fur. The group of elders act as a Town Hall and settle all matters. They believe it may be a coyote or someone from another settlement.
  The people are told never to go into the forbidden woods.  There are poles and yellows flags warning them do not go beyond that point.
  At supper, they hear a howl of a creature in the woods.
 A nervous Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) asks the elders permission if he can go into the forbidden woods to another town to get a supply of medicine and return. It is denied.  Other people have gone into the woods and have never returned.  They are found dead.
  The color ""red"" is not allowed in this community. If you see a red flower blooming, you must pluck it and bury it immediately. If you have red berries, surely it means you have been in the woods.
  Lucius is getting wise.  He knows their are secrets in every corner of this community.
  Lucius opens a basement door and finds someone dressed a creature wearing a red robe. It may be someone from another settlement.  The alarm bell is rung.  Everyone must get into their basement for fear go getting killed.
  Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) is blind. She is not afraid of this creature.  She knows the truth.

2167001,5,B00064LJVO,"This movie is frakkin' *brilliant* on so many levels-- not the least of which are the Games the well meaning Village elders are playing (and conspire to continue to play) on their own children to continue to enjoy an idyllic, but ultimately unreal world of relative calm, peace & tranquility themselves. Who are the real monsters when the adults are willing to not just lie, but LIVE a lie, for their own ends?

Given the context of Ivy's belief system, her courage is truly remarkable-  being willing to go into & through the woods, blind & on her own for her loved one is the real, unrecognized strength of this story.

The scene between Bryce Dallas Howard (as Ivy-- what an extraordinarily beautiful person she plays!) & Joaquin Phoenix (as Lucius) on the porch at night is why I watch movies-- pure poetry for the eye, ear, mind & heart-- and the comment, almost in an off hand way, that we do not touch those who we really have feelings for is breathtakingly insightful.

I applaud the director's courage in making this movie. If you like this, you may also enjoy Signs & Unbreakable.",1240531200,3,1090,4.603092783505154
2167002,3,B00064LJVO,"I've never seen an M. Night movie before, though by now everyone is aware of his reputation. And upon first viewing I was ready to throw my lot in with the naysayers. The dialogue was wooden. The ""twists"" were predictable (I called all except one, and I am not very astute). And that ending... when the second half of the movie totally negates the first half, it makes you feel like an idiot for caring. Not to mention everything else that's wrong (wouldn't it take generation upon generation to create a self-sustaining village with no knowledge of the outside world?). But upon second viewing (with my family) I was ready to just sit back and enjoy the good things. And there are good things. The actors really stepped it up (especially Howard and Hurt, really dig Hurt's speech at the end), and the cinematography is appropriately creepy and claustrophobic, promising something it can never quite deliver. Does that excuse the predictability and annoying literary shortcuts Shyamalan takes? Dunno, you'll have to see how far your suspension of disbelief will take you. Three stars seems about right.",1239753600,5,1102,4.93010752688172
2167003,5,B00064LJVO,"As you can see from the variations in the reviews, people are all over the map with this one.  Honestly, I don't know how you can not like this movie.

Not only did I enjoy it the first time, it's the kind of movie I can watch over and over.  M. Night admits in one of the DVD extras that he probably should have marketed it as a love story (it is), as opposed to a thriller.  Whatever.  I didn't have any preconceived notions or expectations going in.  I just watched it, not knowing what I was in for, and I wasn't at all disappointed.

The soundtrack is excellent, and the use of sound is masterfully done.  If you have a good surround sound system, turn down the lights, crank it up, and just take in the atmosphere of the film.

I am utterly amazed at the negative reviews.  The personal attacks on M. Night are beyond puzzling, as if he's committed a crime or something.  It's funny how people will on the one hand complain that a movie is too predictable, or lacks imagination, etc.  Then a movie like this comes along, and people complain anyway.  Some people are never happy.  It's just a movie, people!!  Relax !

The characters in the film are excellent.  The pace of the film is good.  I always come away at the end wishing it weren't over yet.  M. Night has a great imagination, and he is a masterful storyteller.  I hope he continues to make fantastic movies.",1235174400,2,1373,4.309803921568627
2167004,1,B00064LJVO,"Let's set aside fairly sophomoric criticisms such as the movie was boring or not scary. If you really want to know the reason why this movie is bad, read Roger Ebert's review. It's absolutely perfect in describing the movie's fundamental flaw. Essentially, he makes the argument that the movie is ""based on a premise that cannot support it,"" and that is absolutely dead-on. It was exactly the opinion I had after watching the movie, but he puts it in such beautiful terms that I feel his review is essential reading for anyone interested in this movie, whether you liked it or hated it.

For my own part, it wasn't so much that I ""guessed"" the twist ending early in the movie, but rather that I had assumed that what turned out to be the twist was the reality all along. The movie fails to establish the lie that is necessary for the ending to have any effect. In fact, the only ""establishment"" of this so-called lie is itself a trick on the audience. I can't say more without spoilers.

If you're a fan of Shyamalan's movies, then by all means watch The Village. Just be warned that this movie is not only a bad movie for being boring, not scary, etc. but is a complete insult to its audience for basing itself on a false premise that wasn't even properly established in the first place.",1233619200,5,1288,4.476595744680851
2167005,5,B00064LJVO,"In this film by M. Night Shyamalan, a peaceful village stands in a clearing in the middle of a great wood. The villagers grow their own food, make their own clothes, and make no contact with the towns beyond the wood. It is a sanctuary of innocence, kept away from the sinful settlers of the outside world.
  But not all is bliss. Sickness, injury, and then death comes every so often, with those in the village unable to treat the ailments, because they have no medicines. And they do not venture to the towns, for fear of terrible creatures that live in the wood. They have numerous safeguards against these beings. They have flags of the `safe color' (a dark yellow) surrounding the clearing, and those who watch its border wear the same color. They shun everything of the `bad color' (red), burying even flowers that bear the hue, knowing that this color attracts the creatures.  As long as no human enters the wood, the creatures do not enter the clearing. But if someone crosses the border, the fearsome, flesh-eating brutes do the same. Yet some people, as more die for lack of treatments, determine to brave the woods and gather medicines from the towns.
  This is, in my opinion, one of the great films of our time. I can see that many here at Amazon do not agree, but I do not understand their sentiments. The Village is of high-quality in all respects, with excellent music, cinematography, acting, storytelling, and directing. It is a unique, touching film of love and bravery, and the battle to keep a people innocent.

Have they seen M. Night's other movies people? They aren't supposed to be just scary or just one thing, they are always suspenseful, emotional, funny, a little of everything. I look at it more as love story than anything really myself. And in that light it is so beautifully written. Whether you admit it or not, you are shocked at the end and you think ""wow could this really happen?""

2167014,2,B00064LJVO,"I seem to be the only person who recognizes how poorly written M. Night Shyamalan's films are. Is it because I'm a Hitchcock aficionado? No. I just have an ability to read narrative arcs and see where things are going. It was obvious that Bruce Willis was dead in The Sixth Sense, that Samuel L. Jackson was the bad guy in Unbreakable, and that, well, Signs sucked altogether. Perhaps I demand too much, ot perhaps it's because I see in MNS a burgeoning Spike Lee or Steven Spielberg- i.e.- someone with a great eye but no knack for storytelling. My advice: become a cinematographer, or write better tales! This, especially, goes out to MNS, since he writes his films, and all are `twist ` films- dependent upon that final reveal.
  This film had potential to be as great a work of art as that other great fictive The Village- from the 1967 tv show The Prisoner, but it fails miserably on all levels. MNS wouldn't know a well-written script if you beat him with it. Am I repeating myself? Let me range a little more- I am tired of mere cinematographers posing as auteurs. Learn narrative arcs. Perhaps I do expect too much- like character development, plausible plots, etc. and tales not based on a twist, but situations that logically and/or organically grow out of situation.
  Yet, a quick review of professional critics' reviews was astounding, for most seemed to miss that this was a film not set in the 19th Century- instead believing that some time tripping had occurred. As for the extras? There's no commentary, thankfully, for the featurettes are fellatric enough- including a heinous diary by Bryce Howard, and an execrable bit of another of MNS's bad home movies from childhood. He seems to put far more care into his childhood films selected for the DVDs than he does his actual grown up films. In short, MNS delivers another film with a good premise, but lousy execution in all aspects. I've given up on him as a film director, but I'm sure he's got his next twist film already in the works.

Okay, good photography and ONE good performance (Howard) should not be enough for anybody.  Brody is an embarrassment in probably the stupidest role in the history of the movies. Everyone else is wasted in parts that, to quote Roger Ebert, ""move below the one-dimensional and enter Flatland.""

This is a mess of a failure so monumental it's amazing even one viewer hasn't angrily stomped out of the theater by midpoint.

But if you think about it, The Sixth Sense is no longer scary at the end because we have been following a ghost and know ghosts don't want to harm, rather they just want to be helped.  The problem with this one is that he has taken an idea that has already been used and never admitted it.  The book was called Running Out of Time where a girl is in a village and needs to go get medicine, but when she leaves she discovers she is in present time.  It is done differently, but nonetheless it's the same idea.  Very disappointing to see Shyamalan do that.  I do understand the metaphor, which is a beautiful message, but I don't like him taking ideas.  The directing is great and when watching it you really feel like you are in the setting of the film.  I would recommend people to watch it, but don't expect it to be a great Shyamalan film.",1216598400,2,986,4.196808510638298

2167019,5,B00064LJVO,"This story takes place in a simple town, with very complex characters.  Their world is somehow precarious, though what precisely threatens them is a mystery to the viewer and indeed to most of the inhabitants.  They seem to be a 19C community, supported by religious rituals and a sense of danger at the unknown inhabitants of the surrounding forest.  While there is a life beyond the forest of which they are all aware, they remain completely autarcic, indeed solipsistic in their references to themselves and their pasts.

The acting is so good that the siuation of the characters is entirely believable and at times deeply moving:  there is the search for love and unfulfilled need, the desire to preserve an utterly unique culture, and the yearning of the young, who find incredible inner resources for the trial that awaits.  The mood is consistant, mixing color, sound, and stunning visual imagery.  Each scene  is as complex as a portrait painting, with the expressions implying an entire world with quirky points of view.

The story unfolds as a kind of mythical journey that could go in any number of directions.  I felt the need to learn what the secret was, and when revealed it is not a disappointing banality, but a complex psychological reality.  This film is a great and subtle gem.

2167022,3,B00064LJVO,"Let's get this out of the way: the acting in this movie is superb.  Aside from Adrien Brody's over-the-top portrayal of a retarded person of some kind, each character is very well acted and developed when necessary.  It's quite compelling; actually, the tension, fear, and ignorance of villagers is very realistic.

In addition, the story is told well, with revelations coming at the appropriate moments.  The idea of running away from an increasingly perverse and corrupt society, something with which I can relate very intimately, is somewhat believable.  Even the ""wronged people keep the rest of the village in the dark by telling superstitious gibberish and scaring the kids with fake monsters to preserve their utopia""-angle is a stretch that is acceptable.

There were a few things that just didn't seem right about the movie.  Why did the elders decide to use some variation of old English when the offspring would know no better?  Why did they choose the garb they did when they could just have easily made more contemporary clothes with comfort and without labels?  Forced anachronisticity is all it is.

Aside from all that, the fact that the plane concept is barely touched is ludicrous.  Even if the land were below a no fly zone, it would have to have a ridiculously wide radius that prohibits sight of an airplane.  Picture a funnel, where the diameter at top is ten times that of the bottom, and you'll realize how idiotic this movie is without addressing this issue.  With one sonic boom, with one off course jet, with one airliner at about 20K on a bright and sunny day, or even a helicopter joyride gone astray, their secret is ruined.  And I won't even go into the thought of a wooded area without trespassing hunters, kids, or nature lovers, or the very real probability that one of the kids wouldn't be a complete sissy, and would eventually test the boundaries of society.

It's a fun movie to watch if you can completely ignore the glaring plot-holes and like movies that are minor trainwrecks with highly predictable endings.",1206144000,2,2050,4.833810888252149

I was familiar with few of the actors but they all did a fine job and the casting was absolutely perfect. You won't sleep through this one!

The film yields a unique, fantastical story and I found it to be infinitely refreshing to say the least. It's all about a sect of devoutly religious people who appear to have migrated to a secret wilderness location where they remain insulated from and uninfluenced by outside (western culture) stimuli. And there is some sort of dreaded ""monster"" which both keeps out intruders and equally maintains security to the degree that residents can never venture out.... but venturing out for help becomes medically necessary.

Both the script and superb cinematography of this film are just superb. The color saturation is tremendous and the sets and locations are near perfection. I almost hate to dub this one as a ""horror"" flick because it is so tastefully conveyed but, since there is in fact a ""monster"" of sorts, I'm fairly compelled to do so. But this film goes far beyond the parameters of any horror movie that you've ever viewed before -- there's so much more to it.

The Village is a very subtle sort of film, even moving at times, but there is a constant chill about it. There are some tense sequences and the beautiful score only enhance them. By no means is this supposed to frighten or shock you. Actaully, to be perfectly honest, I'd call it a half romance. And there is a twist. I liked it and thought it was different for a change. The acting is quite good especially by Bryce Dallas who had the most endearing role. You can't help but like her character. I love the mood of this film. Like I said, its not terribly chilling or graphic in any way, but it will keep your attention. I have read some reviews that thought this movie to be slow moving. I wouldn't say that, per se. It certainly isn't  fast-paced by any means, but it is more of a character driven type of film, so we actually get to know the characters quite well. And you even get the director's cameo.

2167030,3,B00064LJVO,"I enjoy M. Night Shyamalan's films for his willingness to press further into the human experience of the strange, both metaphysically and culturally.  To that end, I found ""The Village"" to be more frightening with regard to the underpinnings of society than to any psychological or spiritual terror.  Without giving too much away this film is about a group of people attempting to cope with, deny, and stave off further tragedy.  What was perhaps most significant about this approach is that in approaching grief in this way the group regresses to what would be considered an archaic way of living, rather than transcends grief and moves on.

In this closed off society the young, blind Ivy seeks to venture through the wild unknown of the village's surrounding territory in search of medication for the sick among them.  It is quite fitting in this context that the one who is the least tainted, the least obscured by boundaries of society or the way in which she experiences life to be the one who discovers the debilitating limitations society has imposed upon them all.

While I did not find ""The Village"" to be Shyamalan's best work, the film was well done.  Suspenseful moments keep it lively while the details of 19th century living were well crafted.  The cast was wonderful, all performances well done.  Despite the film not being quite what is expected in theme or delivery, it's a notable feather in Shyamalan's cap, nonetheless.",1201392000,2,1440,4.893004115226337
2167031,5,B00064LJVO,"Try not to read any reviews of ""The Village"" that might contain spoilers. This is one movie you DO NOT want to spoil for yourself.

It's really disappointing to read about the multitudes who hate/dislike this movie, when it's so wonderfully done. First of all, the suspense is fantastic. Though the secret is out after the first viewing, watching it a second time still had me hiding behind a pillow. This isn't meant to be a horror movie in the way we've come to know the genre. In fact, this isn't  a good movie for the people that like gore and violence in their Friday night flicks -unlike many horror movies, the frightening circumstances are used to tell the story and are not THE story. It's more creepy than terrifying, though there are definitely a handful of frightening moments. The love story element is sweet. Ivy's spunky attitude and Lucius' quiet nature fit well together, culminating in a touching dialogue on Ivy's porch and a strong romantic connection throughout the film. Under all this is the gradually revealed commentary on the horrors and follies of human society, even in such a secluded settlement. It's a film that makes you think, gasp, and enjoy it for all its ingenuity.

The casting couldn't be more perfect. Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard not just act but become their characters. Phoenix delivers the perfect blend of the shy but stubborn nature of Lucius, while Bryce Dallas Howard entertains as a delightfully spunky but determined Ivy. They each become our heroes as they fight to save each other. Adrien Brody's Noah is also compelling: his mental state and actions are alarming and one must wonder if he had any real conscience or control through it all. Even the movie's score is riveting, from the haunting lilts to its more intense melodies.

My only complaint comes upon seeing the movie a second time. The twist (which is fantastic) seems to come a bit too early and we are left with too much knowledge for the rest of the film to remain mysterious. But that's only true when you've already seen it once and know what's going to happen. But that first time is a doozy.

It's a Village well worth the visit, even multiple times, in spite of all its loud and unmerited negative reviews. But if you choose to watch it, it's best if all the lights are out.",1201219200,,2305,4.681481481481481

2167033,2,B00064LJVO,"I'll sum this movie up for you.

Modern-day Luddites decide that life was better 150 years ago.  They create a town identical to how towns existed 150 years ago so they can live that lifestyle.

They move themselves there and raise families.  And to keep their children from learning the secret they create these ""monsters"" to terrorize the children into staying close to the town.  As some of the children become adults they learn this secret so that they can help keep the rest of the citizens in the town.

Now ONE of the characters in this movie.. is blind.. she would NOT be blind if they had used the technology of the day to take care of this child pre-natally.  But when the town leader needs the medicines of the modern day to take care of him - that's OK.. they'll just send the blind girl out to go get the stuff so she can't tell anyone is really 2003 and not 1873.

IOW.. a bunch of selfish scumbags decided to put their isolationist views on their children all because ""technology is bad"" - unless it serves their needs of course.

2167036,4,B00064LJVO,"Whenever I went shopping at a local natural foods coop, a male employee would tell me that I look just like Bryce Dallas Howard.  I had no idea who she was until he commented that she is Ron Howard's daughter.  He then recommended that I watch ""The Village"" (assuring me that it really wasn't scary) or ""The Lady in the Water.""  I put that on my never-ending to-do-list and thought that I'd eventually get around to renting those movies. Some of my friends mentioned my resemblance to girl in ""The Village"" as well. But when perfect strangers told me they had to do a double take because they actually thought that I was Bryce Dallas Howard (as though she'd have nothing better to do than go shopping at Target or the mall), I re-prioritized my to-do list.

I first rented ""The Lady in the Water."" This movie had great moments, and I especially loved the sense of community in the apartment complex and the characterization of Cleveland Heep, who discovers the narf. That actor, Paul Giamatti, was amazing and brought such warmth and sympathy to his character.  Yes, this movie is an easy target for panning, and if it had strengths, it also had weaknesses (including a more than usual suspension of disbelief).

Spoilers Warning:
But this review is for ""The Village,"" featuring the same writer/director/producer in M. Night Shyamalan and actress Bryce Dallas Howard.  The ensemble cast was top-notch, and everyone did the most with what they were given.  Adrien Brody managed to evoke sympathy for his character, even after Noah attacked Lucius Hunt in a fit of jealousy.  Due to the elder's removal to the village and refusal to go back to ""real world,"" psychotropic medicines weren't available for the mentally ill Noah.  Lucius asked Ivy if her blindness could have been cured if the elders would have allowed outside treatment. Even though Ivy was blind, she could ""see"" Lucius by sensing a color whenever he was near. Ivy refused to tell Lucius what his color was, but I imagine that she saw red, the forbidden color.  Considering that Ivy was a natural redhead, I thought the shunning of this color a little odd (however, many people argue that red hair is really more orange than red in hue).

When Ivy bravely ventures outside the village to procure medicines for her wounded fiance, I kept wondering why Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver) didn't spearhead this medical intervention.  Going back to a simpler time and place shouldn't involve watching your child needlessly die.  Edward Walker recruited other disillusioned contemporaries, who like himself, had lost close family members to violence. This group started an Amish-like community, a Pennsylvanian settlement whose members made believe that they were still living in the 19th century, an apparently more idyllic time.

People respond differently to tragedy, and this group coped by trying to escape further tragedy. They hoped to create a sort of utopia where the evils of the outside world would never reach its city limits.  They believed that by rejecting what seemed to bring out the worst in people (money, media, fast-paced lifestyle, etc.), they could create a community that would thrive because of family values and cooperation.

Yet you can't shut tragedy out. Or if you try to evade one tragedy, you may create another.  Noah is such an example. Noah couldn't control himself, and point blank, he needed to be medicated.  Noah may never have watched violent television, experimented with illicit drugs, been part of a street gang, etc., but the sort of protection The Village offered proved ineffectual in protecting him and other villagers from violence.

You do get a sense of family and community within The Village, so this experiment of Dr. Walker isn't an entire fiasco, and they still want to continue living this way, even when Ivy becomes aware of a greater outside world. But I think M. Night Shyamalan's themes about the unavoidability of suffering and the futility of trying to escape it are brilliantly rendered in this movie. Also, you can see the origin of myths and legends at work when the elders started the ""farce"" of the Wood Creatures who would attack the villagers or how the color red was irrationally deemed ""the bad color.""  The young people really bought into this legend, and thus they are controlled in part based on fear (for they are afraid to venture beyond the well-established borders of the Village).  It's ironic that fear and duplicity are utilized to attempt a utopia.  This movie is definitely food for thought in terms of social commentary.

I enjoyed the extra features, including Bryce's diary.  I first thought, why is she writing is such an old-fashioned style, then I realized that she was trying to emulate the vocabulary and sentence structure of the 19th century to get into her character.  Bryce gave her all to this role.  If this movie has problems, those problems have nothing to do with Ms. Howard's performance.",1196640000,6,4941,4.914560770156438
2167037,5,B00064LJVO,"Life in the tiny 19th century village of Covington Woods is idyllic; the townfolk live in harmony, completely isolated from the distant Towns that are feared and never visited.  The only problem is the constant threat of the hideous, red monsters that lurk in the woods and send the villagers rushing to their cellars every so often. Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard), the plucky, blind daughter of elder Walker (William Hurt), has fallen in love with strong and shy Luscious (Joaquin Phoenix), son of the Widow Hunt (Sigourney Weaver).  When Luscious' life is in danger, Ivy rises above her fear of the monsters and asks for permission to leave the village and seek medicine in the Towns.

I really enjoyed this movie.  The actors are all excellent and the dark and creepy mood is lightened by a sweet, innocent romance.  Some of the characters are written as stereotypes - Ivy is surely the world's bravest, wisest, and saintly blind person ever - but others are more intriguing:  Adrien Brody gives a touching performance as a mentally retarded young man who causes trouble, and Joaquin Phoenix (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walk-the-Line/dp/B000E8QVWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walk the Line</a>) is endearing as the gentle hero.

2167038,5,B00064LJVO,"After having seen ""Unbreakable,"" ""Sixth Sense,"" and ""Lady of the Water,"" I've become a fan of this film's director.  I made efforts to look up all of his works and watch them.  Though this is my least favorite of them, his work so exceeds my thoughts on other movies that this is still a ""5 star"" movie for me.  As always, this wasn't predictable, which is why I am such a fan.  Indeed, it is slow-paced, but I enjoy the leisurely story-telling atmosphere he usually creates.  There is one very minor logic issue that didn't ruin the movie for us, and I won't describe here in detail because it would be a spoiler for those who haven't watched yet and for those who aren't as nit-picky as we are.  As is typical for his movies, the violence level is quite low and not graphic.  Bryce Howard is an excellent actress.  I look forward to seeing more from her!",1188864000,,856,4.3734177215189876
2167039,5,B00064LJVO,"I was seriously scared by this movie until about half way through.  Then I could relax and wonder what the twist would be this time.  And even though I figured it out, it was so well done that I wasn't disapointed.

Casting here is just great.  All the characters are human, well-written and fit perfectly into the world created.  And, like everyone else, I found Bryce Dallas Howard's Ivy charming.

With most of M. Night Shyamalan's movies, I enjoy them but don't feel the need to watch them over and over - once you see it and then watch again to pick up all the clues, that's pretty much it.  But the characters of ""The Village"" are so engaging that this was one we actaully bought.

And what is the deal with ""Lady in the Water"" having a highter rating??",1188345600,2,759,4.371428571428571

This movie is no Sixth Sense. Only at the end is it quite obvious that most of the previous 90 minutes has merely been a set-up for the final ""no big deal"" twist. I won't give anything away in this review; that wouldn't be fair to you if you've yet to watch the movie.

I'm surprised that actors like Hurt and Weaver would accept roles in such a drab script. Pan my review if you must; in the end, I'm sure that you, too, will feel that these 104 (or so) minutes could have been used doing something more productive or enjoyable.",1186444800,4,621,4.299145299145299
2167042,4,B00064LJVO,"Although this film was widely successful, many felt that it did not live up to Mr. Shyamalan's previous efforts.  I beilieve that is an incorrect assessment.

The Village is a truly beautiful film which tells one of the finest love stories in many years.  The performances by all are top-notch, especially by the two leads, Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard.  The dialogue and usage of symbolism are exceptional, yet only part of the movie's many charms.  The first time I tried to watch the movie, I found it slow and uninvolving.  I was greatly mistaken.  Much time is spent developing the state of the setting and establishing the main characters, rather than immediately jumping headlong into the action.  This makes for a much more satisfying picture for those who like to think, as is the case with all of Night's films (save perhaps Lady in the Water, which is questoinable).

Few motion pictures capture the depths of mystery the way The Village does.  Some say that they guessed the ending long before it came, but I find that unlikely.  The clues are definitely there, as they should be, but everything has been orchestrated so perfectly it is hard to tear yourself away from the story long enough to consider the hidden truth.

Night is a master at revealing the right details at the right times.  The pace can really only be thought of as slow if the viewer doesn't care to pay attention to everthing that is going on within this small village.  Love is the unsung hero of the village, whose roots run deep within the hearts of nearly every person who lives there.  The Village takes us back to a simpler time where morals were the very foundation of a community, where everyone was free to trust everyone else and happiness could be found in even the most mundane things.  Churning the butter, sweeping the porch, washing the dishes - these are joyous undertakings in which each member of the town contributes to the good of all.

As for the creatures, termed ""Those we do not speak of,"" they sure do speak of them a lot!  Despite the fear the creatures evoke, it also strikes one as just a little humorous that was the term given to the mostly unseen monsters of the woods.  Despite this, The Village is very intense indeed.  It is mesmorizing to watch as the audience alternates between the goodness of the people and the fear that exists just out of sight.

I cannot say enough goos things about this underrated film.  I loved every moment of it.  Perhaps the best feature is how it shifts perspectives in mid-stream, but fails to lose any of its credibility.  One day when you are feeling particularly low, know that you can count on this wonderful story to move you, to lift you up.  The ending is awesome too!",1182297600,2,2734,4.6107660455486545
2167043,4,B00064LJVO,"This movie doesn't have quite the scare factor of Shyamalan's ""Sixth Sense,"" nor quite the same level of twist-ending. However it is still an absorbing movie that provides a satisfactory wrap for all the mystifications it dangles along the way. And more than that, it is capable of provoking a lot of serious discussion among any group of friends who see the movie together.

In fact, this would be a good movie to screen for almost any classroom because of the lively, larger debate it invites. It is suitable for almost all individuals old enough to consider such issues, without in any way being a watered down, sanitized ""kids' movie.""

It is likely to fraction viewers off into the pros and the cons, with all sorts of shadings in between. It is especially relevant when considering communities that set themselves apart, either intentionally, such as the Amish, or through the necessities of historic struggle, such as many Native American communities. How far should things be allowed to go in these instances of isolation? You may well ask yourself that after you have finished watching ""The Village.""",1181606400,,1109,4.956989247311828

This was no fault of the  excellent casts and the  artistic cinematography. The projection of an almost Amish like  isolated  Victorian era village  community  was very well -handled. As at least one other reviewer has written, the damp  leafless November woods and mists lend as eeriness  most suitable to the setting of the story. However, the story line itself is fatally flawed. The ending could have been saved had a better extra twist been added than the one we are shown. I do not want to  include any spoilers here. In fact  part of my problem is that I learnt too much about the movie before I watched it. Inevitably when there are so many dismal  film works shown  indiscriminately on TV channels one resorts to site such as  Amazon or IMdB for some sense of whether a  film  to be screened on TV is worth watching  or taping.

I am very fond of what might be called ""twilight  zone"" genre films  despite the fact that so few of this kind are successful. It is probably one of the most challenging film script genres to write. So I would have  incorporated and expanded the feeble attempt at an extra twist right at the end of the film of a kind that  would have  strengthened the predictable and not very  impressive main twist with a less predictable ending. This is not a movie that most people might enjoy, even if it were improved by such suitable amendments and additions that might occur at some time in the future, but for  a minority it is an extremely well done if not a perfectly finished work of art.

He set the old, damp, village atmosphere well. I wasn't a big fan on how the end was shot or handled (supposed surprise)(I loved how he cut to the credits from the bed/room shot though)so I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.

However, like all M. Night's works you get so much build up, then a flat ending.  I always feel like breaking into a rendition of Peggy Lee's ""Is that all there is?"" after watching his works.  There is no surprise.  You see this one coming the whole way.

I enjoy this moving, the imagery is stunning, rarely achieved in any film coming out of Hollywood.  M. Night is a virtuoso as a cinematographer.  And he teases, lures and torments you into expecting so much, thinking this is great.

Then whatzzadat?  The ending is flat, leaving you disappointed.  Maybe he needs to pay someone to write his endings, give him one that matches the body of the work.

Four stars for the sheer beauty and the heart of a storyteller.  One star for another weak M. Night ending.  Very worth repeat watching, but expect to feel let down each time.

It is because we've been learning about utopian communities, and ""The Village"" takes place in a utopian community.

  You can't let anything get passed you in this movie, because, like signs, what you hear and see early in the movie comes back towards the end.  And someone said that Adrian Brody's character Noah Percy (who is autistic) does something that makes no sense and has no explanation.  Ahh but it does.  I don't want to give it away, but if it's what he did to Lucious, then it is because Ivy told him never to strike anyone, so he didn't strike Lucious, instead he did what he did.

2167054,4,B00064LJVO,"The Village is M. Night Shyamalan's fourth film and it's a hard one to review without giving too much away.  Shyamalan has made a niche for himself delivering movies (Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense) that pack a surprise punch at the end, and The Village is no different.

The film takes place in a village set in a valley ringed with a forest.  The time is indeterminate, although the clothes are old fashioned, as are the houses and furniture.  There is a shot of a tombstone in the cemetery early on in the film that shows a date of 1897, and the village certainly wouldn't be out of place in the 19th century.  The form of speech of the village citizens is also somewhat archaic.

As the story unfolds we learn that the village exists in a state of uneasy truce with the creatures living in the forest around them.  The creatures, whom the villagers refer to as Those of Whom We Do Not Speak, apparently are attracted by the color red, as the villagers shun that color, even going so far to uproot and bury wildflowers of that color.  The villagers maintain a ring of poles with yellow flags by day, and torches by night to keep the creatures out of the village.  They also maintain a watch tower, where a sentry watches through the night.  About all the sentry can do, though, is ring a bell to alert the villagers to hide in their cellars when the creatures decide to enter the town. The village elders, who are the town's governing body, are also concerned about the repeated occurrence of skinned animal carcasses showing up in the valley.

That's the background and the starting point of the movie, which is basically about the love between the quiet, soft-spoken Lucious Hunt, well played by Joaquin Phoenix and the independent, but blind, Ivy Walker, wonderfully played by Bryce Dallas Howard.  Both Phoenix and Howard are marvellous in their roles, and are surrounded by a great cast including William Hurt as Ivy's father Edward Walker, Sigourney Weaver as Lucious's mother Alice Hunt and especially Adrien Brody as the mildly retarded Noah Percy.  One of the real treats of this movie is watching how these strong characters interact with each other.

Shyamalan did an outstanding job directing the cast, and a phenomenal job of filming.  Every shot is well thought out, and only shows you what he wants you to see.  Especially powerful are the shots of the creatures, for the most part mere suggestions of figures in red, Shyamalan lets your imagination fill in the rest.  The brooding autumnal forest around the valley makes for especially powerful images.  The green and austere village fits in perfectly with it's surroundings.  Shyamalan's use of strange angles really help to create the mood and bring out the best in his storytelling.

Above all Shyamalan is a craftsmen, and The Village is a well-crafted film.  Some may guess the secret before the end, but no one can doubt that this is a powerful story of love, well acted, and well filmed.",1170720000,6,2961,4.710679611650486
2167055,5,B00064LJVO,"Last night I was watching the M. Night Shyamalan film ""The Village"" (2004) and found it to be a mystical parable. St John of the Cross, in his poems and commentaries ""The Dark Night"" and ""The Ascent of Mt Carmel"" and even in the ""Living Flame of Love"" speaks of darkness and blindness as states in which one proves the love for the Beloved. In the film, the blind young girl is the only one able to save her beloved, wounded for love of her. The Spiritual Canticle emphasizes the ""wound of love."" ""Why, since you wounded this heart, don't you heal it?"" The soul must not fear the ""wild beasts"" while going through the ""woods and thickets"" to find healing for the Beloved, just like the girl trying to avoid the ""monsters"" in the woods.

In the film, the lovers pledged themselves ""in the serene night,"" ""the tranquil night."" In ""The Village"" the maidens must ""stay away"" from the ""outskirts."" The emphasis on solitude in the poems of St John, especially in ""The Dark Night"" where it says ""in a place where no one else appeared"" was similar to the scene in the film where the young maiden realizes she must make the journey alone. Only pure love and self-sacrifice in the blindness of faith can save the one she loves.

On another level, I find ""The Village"" interesting for the portrayal of flight from the world. It has long been a Christian practice to withdraw into the desert to find God and peace. However, as the Desert Fathers discovered, we can never escape the our own human nature and the wounds of original sin. In the pristine refuge of Covington Wood, people fall in love with the wrong people, there is jealousy, and even hatred. The elders must keep the youngsters in line through the terrifying story of monsters in the woods, so that even in the safety of the wilderness the children are afraid. While we are in the flesh, there is no escape and the only true refuge is the Lord.",1170460800,3,1896,4.492753623188406
2167056,3,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan has trouble finding his footing with his fourth feature film, and it becomes apparent about half way through that a man we once thought could become the next Hitchcock may end up nothing more than a one hit wonder.  The film as a whole was horribly miss-advertised, promoted as a thriller when it becomes a film more about loyalty and love than anything else.

The twist ending, instead of impressing us and scaring us all the more (just think how you felt when you realized Bruce Willis was really dead, or when you realized Samuel Jackson was indeed a crazed killer...Goosebumps), ends up ruining everything that Shyamalan works so hard to establish in the films outset.  That's the biggest problem right there...you find out the twist ending to early...and then Shyamalan again tried to scare you and it comes off comical and campy, and campy is NOT what Shyamalan was going for, I'm sure of that.

The beginning of this film, maybe even the first three quarters, is effectively ominous, but once the big secret is revealed all eerie overtones flee and they will never be repeated, so as a thriller this film falls flat on it's face for there is no way that this film will even be remotely scary the second time around.

BUT...as a dramatic love story this movie actually works wonders (aside from the one campy chase scene in the woods that would have been much more effective had the `fake' looking quote-unquote creature remained hidden throughout).  The acting in this film is top-notch, and the chemistry between stars Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix is undeniable.  Adrian Brody is successful in portraying the village handicap and Jayne Atkinson is wonderfully used as Ivy's (Howard) sister.

This is why I'm so torn because my initial reaction is to hate this film for pretending to be something it's not, for tricking me into thinking I was going to have a spine-tingling good time and instead serving up a romance of sorts, but I can't get too upset for this romantic drama is actually a very good one.

So, in closing, this is not the movie you think it's going to be, but that doesn't mean it's not a movie you should see.  I say everyone see for themselves, but watch with an open mind, knowing full well this is not another `Sixth Sense', not even another `Unbreakable' but it's something altogether different, altogether it's own and shows that while Shyamalan may have lost touch with what is truly terrifying, he still knows how to tell a story (aside from the horrendous `Lady in the Water').",1168905600,2,2540,4.73922902494331

This particular movie was difficult to classify.  It is my understanding that it's in the horror genre, but it doesn't seem to fit in the traditional sense. If it did, we wouldn't have watched it.  We were advised that this one is more of a suspenseful movie by a friend, and she was correct.  In that sense, it seems to have a Hitchcockian feel to it.

It's difficult to do a review on something like this because it's too easy to give a spoiler.  Basically, the inhabitants of a small village live in terror of creatures in the surrounding woods.  Within the village, there is a love triangle situation of sorts, which begets a serious event --a crime.  A young woman must face her fear of the creatures in the woods... or her beloved will die.

Review without spoilers:  The people of a 19th Century village live in an isolated valley, separated by Covington Woods from ""the towns"" from which their elders came.  The woods are inhabited by mysterious creatures, savage meat eaters with which the villagers have a truce.  That truce is threatened when a child's death from illness causes a young man called Lucius Hunt to ask the elders for permission to travel through Covington Woods to the towns, in search of new medicines.

Spoilers follow from here on:

I sought out this movie after reading ""The Giver,"" a young adult novel with a similar plot twist at the end, and reading a review in which a reader accused the author of that book of stealing the idea from M. Night Shyamalan.  ""The Village"" is beautifully filmed and acted, with attention to detail that has me picking up things I didn't notice before every time I watch it.  It's very much a romance, not a horror movie; and that's fine with me, since I loathe horror.

Have the elders done a good and loving thing for their children, in protecting them from the world outside?  Or have they abused those children in the worst way possible, by ""protecting"" them from the chance to make their own choices?  Is the life they've created actually a better one?  And how is it that Noah, the village idiot, is the only person from his generation - that's never known any other life - to figure out the true nature of the ""forest monsters"" all by himself?

2167061,5,B00064LJVO,"The villiage is one of those few movies I've bought so I can see it again.  I was fully engrossed with the story, so that the weaknesses of the premise which were such an issue with other reviewers didn't mean anything to me.  I was facinated by the interactions of this small band of people isolated from the rest of the world, some battling to keep others controlled by terror, the others battling to live their lives amid the terror.

The movie seemed a little modest and unfulfilled in many ways (sometimes like local summer theatre).  There must have been a very limited production budget.  But I was completely engrossed by the subpot involving the blind girl Ivy, and her heroic journey to the towns to get medicine to save the life of the young man she loves.

A very special bonus is the remarkable score by James Newton Howard.  I enjoyed the plot and the acting, but this movie wouldn't come close to reaching its emotional impact without the marvelous, emotional music by Mr. Howard, who frequently works on M. Night Shamalan films.

I could watch the footage of Ivy's journey a million times, the scenes, the acting by Bryce Dallas Howard, the music, and the cinematography.  It is gripping to every sense.  I am enthralled every time I watch it.

Indeed, the world does move for love, and kneel in awe at it. It's one of the most incredible films of the last ten years, easy.  Definitely Night's best, by far.

I know, Ill get this out of the way fast. Just watch this movie for what it is, not what you want it to be! People argue that its not scary, or that the twist ending was horrible. Its not a horror movie, its not suposed to scare you. Its a love story. And listen to this: the twist ending?, its not suposed to be a surprise, its suposed form this whole movie, its suposed to define who these characters are, and what they are trying to do. This is a story of love, and of hope and innocence.

I just don't see how people who are fans of Shyamalans other movies can say ""I hated the ending, very predictable"" because, fans, you know what Shyamalan does, you know from seeing Signs that hes a deep writer, that he gives much more meaning than what you think its going to be.

So please, if the only thing thats holding you back from seeing this is the critics, or your friends, then see it anyway. Why would you let other peoples opinions rule what you like, or don't like? Sure, many didn't like it, some didn't even understand it, but that doesnt mean you won't like it. You just have to try it out.

If you haven't had the end ruined for you, thats even better, because you still have this whole movie to look forward to, and if you don't enjoy it, than fine, but atleast you can say yourself that you didn't like it. I know too many people who haven't seen it because it got bad reviews.

If you enjoy a good love story, or even an art-sy type of suspence movie, then im sure you will enjoy it. But its not for everyone. Im sure, if you get bored easily, or if you don't have an imagination (this is a MUST HAVE for any Shyamalan film)

And then theres the soundtrack, which deserves 5 stars all by itself because its so magical. Shyamalan is one of the few who knows how to use music for film, who can make the music be a character in the movie.

The scary moments just added to the drama. Having grown up in the country, I know how scary the woods can be. I loved all the twists to the story.

The only thing I didn't like was William Hurt's performance. It was too hammy. I think if this critical role had been cast by another actor, the movie would've moved along at a better pace.

It just took a while for those who emerged from theaters declaring The Village a two-hour life support system for a twist ending to appreciate that there's a lot more to this movie than its concluding surprise. (No, I won't give it away, even if by now nearly everyone surely knows what that surprise is, but if you don't know, be careful about reading any farther.) What I grasped about The Village, aside from embracing a story I liked for itself, and for its ending which I didn't see coming, was a message of optimism that said it is possible for people to escape the boundaries and rules of an oppressive time and place, and recreate reality to suit their preferences. Think about that for a minute. People go scatterbrained trying to elude the dictates of our culture today, for instance, with its violence, its corporate intrusions, its governmental omnipresence, and here we saw a successful  experiment in utopian existence set in 1890, and I found that wonderful. I also loved the scenery, the muted color schemes, the attention to period detail and to the agrarian life. The performances of Bryce Dallas Howard, Joachim Phoenix, and William Hurt were also highly underrated. Never has a stretch of bare woods surrounding a meadow looked so foreboding. Never has the monster in the fairy tale been so close at hand. I liked The Village from the first day I saw it, and continue to think well of it even now.",1162944000,,1542,4.627737226277373

I can't understand how good actors like Weaver, Hurt, and Phoenix would let themselves be wasted on this. The 'plain' dialogue among the 'elders' is painfully numbing, choppy, and stilted.  And the directing drove me crazy, especially since M. Night...insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through, or following them without ever bothering with close-ups. These scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera.  If you like the back of William Hurt's head, you'll get plenty of it in this film, the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague; which is too bad, since when he finally has a good speech, we are deprived of the anger I imagine was in his eyes.  I agree with others, I would have worked better as a 30 minute Twilight Zone episode.

Even for all of the bad press that this movie got, and all of the disgruntled viewers who were expecting another horror, this truly is one of my favorites from M. Night Shyamalan - this, along with ""Lady In The Water"" (another MUST have for me), is a movie that I feel compelled to add to my collection. As the other reviewers state, it's not truly scary, but more a suspenseful film, as I actually find ALL of Shyamalan's movies to be. In my humble opinion, he's not trying to provide movies best-suited to Halloween scare-fest marathons, but movies that are suspenseful and thought-provoking. As annoying as some of his ticks may be to some viewers, there's thought put into each of his films, unlike stupid wastes of celluloid like ""Hostel"" and those damned ""Saw"" movies (enough, already)!

At least after seeing this in the theatre, I felt that I'd gotten my money's worth for the ticket price, and this is definitely a movie that I feel I could watch repeatedly. In my opinion, the social commentary and romantic aspects only add to the viewing experience provided by this film. Don't buy this if you're looking for a horror like ""The Exorcist"" - if that's what you want, buy and watch ""The Exorcist"". If you're looking for a film with twists and turns that tie in to a somewhat deeper meaning, and will have you nodding your head in agreement with the way things play out on screen, buy this movie.

2167073,5,B00064LJVO,"The Village is one of the more reviled films of recent years but for me, much to my surprise, one of the best. People tend to describe Shyamalan's films as overblown Twilight Zone episodes, but in fact they're closer to The Outer Limits. Where Twilight's half-hour format reduced most stories to basic ""What if?"" shaggy dog stories (albeit darn good ones), Limits' longer running time gave them the freedom to ask ""What would it be like?"" and concentrate on the characters experiencing extraordinary events. The Village is certainly more character-based than plot-led, with the film's real twist not being the nature of Those We Do Not Speak Of but the fact that it's not ostensible leading man Joaquin Phoenix's story but Bryce Dallas Howard's, and that it's not a horror film at all but a quietly affecting love story. More surprising too is that for the first time Shyamalan reveals himself to be a surprisingly good writer for women, with Howard's part one of the best for a leading actress in a mainstream film in years.

Some of the dialog is a little awkward in pastiching 19th century literature rather than 19th century speech, but the cast of mainly classically trained stage actors manage to sell all but the most awkwardly constructed sentences. Indeed, the use of language and the constant double meanings in lines such as ""We are grateful for the time we have been given"" is surprisingly important and shows that there's a literate intelligence at work here, not something that can usually be said for summer movies. Just as interesting is Shyamalan's emphasis on body language and unspoken communication - beyond the surprising attraction of a blind character for one who virtually never speaks, the film is littered with little touches that tell much, such as Sigourney Weaver noticing that William Hurt not touching her proffered hand is a far more intimate and loving act than taking it. In fact, as a filmmaking it's in a completely different league to his previous films, with a beautiful use of color (especially surprising after the sombre muted tones of his earlier films) and design, superb editing, strong performances and a good eye for a memorable image, be it two girls spinning around as they sweep the porch or the torchlit shots of the watchtower on the edge of the woods. A nod to James Newton Howard's restrained but surprisingly emotive scoring too. Very impressive indeed despite a few awkward patches.

The DVD offers a fine 1.85:1 transfer that compliments Roger Deakins' superb cinematography as well as a good selection of extras.",1158537600,3,2569,4.944444444444445

I really liked this film. Granted, it wasn't a wall-to-wall fright-fest, but for me, it worked on three levels.

1. First, it's a love story, and a touching one at that.

2. A second theme illustrates the fact of man's extreme susceptibility to irrational fears and beliefs. Humankind's long history of believing in unseen, unproven gods, demons, devils, angels and so forth is ample evidence of that.

3. The third theme is that you can take the boy away from crime,  but you can't take the crime out of the boy. Set up a commune to get away from the crime and ills of society, and it's only a matter of time before someone is found with a knife in his chest.",1158451200,,725,4.421052631578948
2167075,4,B00064LJVO,"This is definitely one of those ""love it or hate"" it type of films. I belong to the former by the way :) Anyway, I think it was an ambitious sort of film that was not without serious flaws. I found the score (especially lead violinist, Hilary Hahn) and sound effects a perfect complement to the overall tone (no pun intended) of the film. In fact, I felt that the dominant violin gave momentum and a strong emotional identity to certain moments within the film.

  Important Side Note: Before I proceed any further I have to make something very clear - I've spent an inordinate amount of time reading other reviews of this film so much so in fact that I'm not sure if I'll be able to compose a completely original one myself without borrowing from someone else's thoughts. With that said, I will try to the best of my ability to remain as original as possible. If anyone sees anything similar to what they had written from here on in ... my humblest apologies! It was sincerely unintentional. Also, be forewarned - spoilers ahead so if you didn't see the film yet, you may want to wait before you read any of this.

  Moving on, I found that most of the ""a- list"" performers were basically too restrained and woefully underused throughout most of the film. I understand that these characters were supposed to be pragmatic people living in simpler times and not given to excessive verbosity but, it would've been nice have seen a couple of more dramatic speeches like the one given by William Hurt in which he was attempting to justify his unilateral decision to allow his daughter to go to the ""towns"". Although Sigourney Weaver had some dialogue, it seemed very inadequate and fine veteran actors such as Celia Weston did little more than offer up occasional facial gestures and body language throughout most of her scenes and that was a shame to see. I think this ended up being a bit of a miscalculation on Night's part. Maybe the film would've been better served by casting all the principals with unfamiliar actors. Sometimes it's good to ""anchor"" a film with a few familiar veteran actors but, in this case, I think it was more of a distraction from the human tapestry/community theme that was being presented at the outset of the story. When the focus ultimately shifted away from the village and on to Ivy's undertaking, I really felt a lot of that good talent went to waste. Maybe the distraction was part of Night's plan to surprise the audience with the sudden realitization that the true story of the village was really about the blind girl, Ivy rising up out of relative obscurity to become the main protagonist of the film. Night himself states, in the bonus section of the DVD, that the emergence of Ivy as heroine was the big ""secret"" in the story (as opposed to the ""O. Henry style twist"" at the end). I think it was intentional of Night to cast a ""not famous yet"" actress to play the part of Ivy in order to divert the audience's attention away from the big secret that was yet to unfold. She sort of blended in with the background of the story until the time was right for her to emerge and become the focal point. By the way, Howard's portrayal of Ivy is one of those special few performances that will haunt me and linger with me for a long time to come and if this is any indication, Bryce Dallas Howard will be a household name in no time. It was a wonderful and important breakthrough performance for this fine young actress.

  The film is full of allegory...political, social you name it. The story of Little Red Riding Hood has always been looked upon as a microcosm of the epic struggle between good and evil and the second half of this film (shall I say) borrows heavily from that fabled story. An innocent kind-hearted blind girl driven by a selfless sense of love and compassion for another human being... I know it's easy to be cynical and dismissive about this and see the film as being blatantly manipulative but, I made the leap of faith and allowed myself to be caught up with her struggle as well as the somewhat-misguided good-natured intentions of the village elders. We all know it's wrong to try to maintain a society through fear and intimidation but that seems all secondary to the notion of trying to make a better world for the ones that we love most and that's what Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), Ivy and the town elders were all attempting to at least try to do. And, we as the audience, already know the inherent futility in all of this and get a front row seat to witness the beginning of the end to this would-be Utopian experiment. How ironic that the elders attempted to create and control a manufactured community through fear, ignorance and intimidation ... the very same reasons they abandoned their own modern society. They should've know better and therein lies the tragedy in this gothic horror/romance. Their misguided attempt to preserve innocence was perhaps all in vain because what ultimately makes societies ""go bad"" comes from deep within the human condition and all attempts to isolate people from perceived ""bad"" external societal factors is the ultimate exercise in ignorance and futility. The ill-fated love triangle turned violent is a good case in point. William Golding's novel, ""Lord of the Flies"" addresses some of the very same issues.

  I also noticed a lot of symbolism throughout the film. I tend to overanalyze things more than I should but this is some of what I picked up on (don't laugh!):

  Ivy's passage through Covington Woods could be interpreted as a personal journey as opposed as a trip to ""the towns"" in order to retrieve medicine for the ailing Lucius. This purgatorial ""rite of passage"" (complete with sinkhole and sinister red monster) could symbolize Ivy's own personal pitfalls and inner fears. By defeating the creature, she conquered her own fears. By tricking him into killing himself is an act of self-consummation which, kharma-wise, serves as a fitting end for such a wretched creature not unlike the proverbial serpent swallowing its own tail. If you noticed, her final obstacle out of the woods was the ivy-covered wall. So, in a way, Ivy's final obstacle was herself - further bolstering the position that she was conquering herself and things within herself.

  The sinkhole could also represent the dark abyss that lurks within each and every one of us. Maybe poor Noah ended up falling into his own abyss - lying at the bottom of his own emotional pit of despair (and yes, I know an abyss is supposed to be bottomless).

  The creature could also be an external manifestation of Noah's (Adrien Brody) own anger, frustration and inability to express himself as others could. His own personal ""id monster"" perhaps.

  The red and yellow colors could be a swipe at our own national terror alert color coding - the inference being that color could be used to control and moderate the flow of the collective anxiety of a population of people (e.g. red = bad and yellow = not so bad). Combine that with the fact that the self-appointed leader's name is Walker - maybe an esoteric reference to George Herbert Walker Bush.

  The forest can be associated with fears of the unknown...fear of becoming lost amid a faceless, nameless uncaring society, and on and on and on.

  Like the fall of countless totalitarian societies throughout history and, on a much smaller scale, modern-day Amish and Shaker style communities... they're all doomed to eventual failure but not for lack of trying, mind you. Instead, the failure arises from man's attempts at suppressing the human spirit and his endless attempts at assuming the role of creator... never going to work. Personally, I kind of hope that the village survives (which is what the film suggests) but, I think it's only a matter of time before bigger and greater crises present themselves further weakening the framework of this particular society to the point of implosion. Then again, maybe I shouldn't be so pessimistic and maybe I should have more faith in the positive side of human nature and maybe that's a message that the film is trying to deliver as well.

  But what serves as an inspirational counterpoint to all of this is Ivy's success at overcoming every possible obstacle that life had placed before her to complete her mission driven only by her love and concern for Lucius and probably every other single member of that community. That's the heart of the film for me... boundless triumph of the human spirit. When society fails the individual, the individual somehow finds a way of redeeming society. That's the emotional core for me at least. That's what I'm taking away from all of this and that's why I go to the movies.

  Final thoughts: Excellent cinematography with wonderful use of light, shadows and fog. Remember how the homes were backlit in the evening? Great sound editing and awesome soundtrack. I loved all the taut, tense moments but the romance was what this story was all about.

  Best scene moment: When Lucius Hunt pulls Ivy into the house at the last possible second right before the creature was upon her. Everything was perfect - the violin, the camera angles, the looks on their faces... At that instant, I realized how destined they were for each other and how selfless their love was for each other. A perfect moment in film-making.",1156032000,6,9323,4.717364532019705

2167077,4,B00064LJVO,"It's unfortunate for M. Night Shyamalan that his first major movie was ""The Sixth Sense."" It was just so darn good that he's going to spend the rest of his career regretting it--because every movie he does will inevitably be compared to it.

And I believe that's the main reason the critics have been so hard on ""The Village."" Even though it is a fine movie, better entertainment than 90% of the year's releases, it wasn't as good as ""The Sixth Sense"" so people feel let down.

But let's not compare, let's just look at ""The Village."" The cinematography is exceptional, creating a moody, suspenseful tale that doesn't depend on lurid special effects for its impact. The dialogue is a bit stilted, but the acting is solid, (impeccable in the case of Bryce Dallas Howard). Yes, the pacing is a little off and after the second sinkhole scene (I'm being careful to not give out any plot spoilers) we feel a little let down. But this film has a clever, well-executed premise and explores important questions about humanity in an entertaining way: can we escape tragedy? is it even worthwhile to try?

Ultimately Shyamalan leads us to discover that we can't run from man's inhumanity to man because wherever we go we take it with us, but the effort is still noble because love and hope make the struggle worthwhile. And that's a lesson you don't learn from having a sixth sense, only from experiencing life with others in the village of life.",1156032000,3,1436,4.66798418972332

The Village isn't a typical horror movie, and once viewers manage to get past that point, they'll find the movie has many subtle nuances and a lot to offer. I had great fun with it.

A smattering of extras on the dvd. The deleted scenes and production footage is nice, but Shyamalan's old home movies don't really add anything to the package. The Village is solid entertainment that just needs a few years to find the right audience.",1154131200,2,718,4.398496240601504
2167093,2,B00064LJVO,"The Village is a completely frustrating film.  It's shot beautifully, boasts a talented cast of actors, showcases a clearly talented new comer in Bryce Howard, but leaves the viewer with the dreaded, ""Is that it?  Is that all there is?""

Scores of armchair film reviewers along with seasoned pros, have criticized, scorned and outright panned the film for it's obvious borrowing from Rod Serling's classic TV show <M. Night, if you NEVER did see that TZ episode, I'd be shocked!> so there's no reason to go over well trod analytical territory.  What I'd like to comment on is the inherent weakness of the character motivations.  After all in a film such as this, everything hinges upon character mindsets and decisions.

I should say bizarre and unbelievable character motivations.  Granted, there have been public - and private - cults of people who would make the denizens of The Village look tame - Rev Jim Jones Cult, Korseh in Waco Texas and the Halle Bopp Comet come to mind, however it strains credulity in most every way to believe that so many would give up so much to gain so little.

But they had a pristine green valley, sturdily built cute houses and fashions that would make Laura ""Half-pint"" Ingalls Wilder green with envy!  Yes, they did.  They also had no sense of natural progress, no sense of bestowing free choice and entitlement onto their children and of course no sense of reality.  These people were on par with the Truman Show - living a life of illusion while only the elder anointed knew the truth, because it was for the ""better.""  The Village reminded me of just another lavish reality show, except in this case, nobody was voted off, nobody won a prize and nobody was laughing.

On the contrary, because of their refusal to keep any type of modern medicinal supplies, tragedy almost happened.  Plot devices like this one are what's so frustrating - there was a thousand reasons why Ivy could have ventured ""beyond the border"" - this one is contrived, convenient and ultimately idiotic.  If only the director had added scenes of regret, or philosophical doubt on the parts of the participants - something.  Instead we get a rushed scene about how ""our life must continue in this fashion.""  If you plan a community that much, if you put that much work and financial resources into it , you don't ever consider medical emergencies?  Yes, it was an experiment in ""utopia"" - things like that SHOULDN'T have happened in such an environment of innocence.

And therein lies the irony, for despite a thoroughly pleasing looking movie with great acting, The Village should not have happened either.",1154131200,7,2618,4.803571428571429

A bunch of girls go in (me and my friends), we come out teary-eyed and sighing ""all that in the name of love.  How wonderful"".  Not to mention the ending, which I enjoyed, being not only a girl, but a twilight zone, sci-fi, fan of the weird.  As you can imagine, a lot of my dorkier friends came out pleased.

It's a movie for those that like this sort of movie.  It was advertised as, well, I don't know what to call it. Just sort of a horror mystery chiller.  Which it sort of was, and sort of wasn't.  If this is your type of movie, you'll LOVE it.  If it's not, then I'll warn you it's not for everyone.

M Night takes his time with everything he does.  He's in no hurry to get you where he wants to get you.  Especially in the case of a ""period"" piece like he has here.

I believe this movie is more about the futility of trying to control human behavior then anything else.  The ""monsters"" that are there (but not there) are in all of us through the emotions we display on a daily basis.  Using fear to maintain control has never been a good idea and the ""elders'  seem to have forgotten that it was their fear that created this mess in the first place.

The director scored big with 'The Sixth Sense' and has been living off the buzz of that movie ever since.  As that movie showed, Shyamalan does have talent, but it's becoming painfully obvious that the new 'Master of Suspense' he so desperately wants us to believe he is, is more a master of marketing-- mostly of himself.  Notice how his name appears in his movies' billing, auteur-of-legend style.  And did you know the 'Night' part of his name is something he came up with himself...'Night,' oooh...how spooky, how mysterious.  It's actually kind of cute.  But if all he has left in him is stinkers like this one he can probably say 'night to his career, though I imagine Hollywood will keep his 'legend' in circulation for at least one or two more preposterous and pretentious films.

2167106,4,B00064LJVO,"From the previews, you would think that The Village is a horror flcik. You would think that it is about a small village from the 1800s or something that is being tormented by outside demons or something- monsters would be a better description. From the commercials, you see a red mark painted on peoples' doors. You may think this attracts these creatures, or scares them away. But The Village is actually the last thing you expect...

...I'm not going to explain the enitre plot, but I'll explain the basic idea: It's about a, well, a village that secretly shuns itself from technology and the outside world. Only a select number of people know this, and they are to keep it secret from the rest of the village. To make sure that no one finds out, if someone crosses the limit of the forest, someone dresses up in the costume of a creature, and chases them off. Then, other people dress up in these costumes and got to the village. They go into the peoples' houses and act like they're going to kill them, but the people hide and the people in the costumes act like they can't see them. This is supposed to warn the people that they are not to go beyond the forest limit.

There's a lot more to the plot than that, but I don't want to explain anymore, since everyone else has explained the plot. The 1st time I saw this, I hated it. I was expecting monsters and intense scenes and so on. After my dad explained it to me, I was able to shed some light on The Village and actually enjoy it. It's no The 6th Sense, or even another Signs, but James Atkinson proves that he's a pretty good director, and I think that if you approach this movie with an open mind, you can actually enjoy it. It's more of a sci-fi movie than a horror, which is what you think it would be about from the previews. But like I said, if you watch it with an open mind, you may find The Village entertaining.

To be honest, I've never found his plot twists to be especially clever or unpredictable, but I have always loved his movies because of the way he involves the viewer from the first scene onwards.

Even with Signs, which was at best only an average sci fi movie, M Night still succeeded in wowing his audience due to the metaphorical layering that is present in all of his movies, including The Village.

Yep, much of the hidden truth of The Village can be guessed ahead of time, but that does not stop it being an intensely involving movie.

The entire notion of a village secluded and hiding from scary monsters who prey on the color red is absurd, but after the ""big secret"" is revealed how can one still claim the film was bad?

Not that you couldn't see the twist coming a mile away, perhaps within the first ten minute of the movie. And yet the power of the tragic love triangle is gripping, perhaps due to the writing, but also certainly to the performances of the three young actors, Adrien Brody, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Joaquin Phoenix.

Phoenix and Dallas Howard have more chemistry here than he did with Reese Witherspoon in WALK THE LINE! In THE VILLAGE, his character, Lucius Hunt, plays a game of ""Ring of Fire"" that's really chilling, and when Ivy has to go on an epic journey to save his life it's totally involving, because we've gotten to care about the character. (SPOILERS.) I did find it hard to believe that her father, who is supposed to adore her, made her go through the whole routine alone, even though she's blind for goodness sake, and when he tells her about the stream and the hidden road he didn't even mention to the 15 foot tall fence she bumps into? Well, maybe it was built after his time I suppose, but it just seemed cruel and, if I were her, I would never, ever speak to my father ever again! I'd be like, ""Oh, so you took a vow never to go to ""the towns"" again? Well, I'm taking a vow that you're dead.""

I kept thinking that the movie might have been better had it been made in the 1960s, and the William Hurt character could have been played by Vincent Price, Byrce Dallas Howard as the blind girl might have been Mia Farrow, Brendan Gleeson's character would have been Peter Cushing (can't you see him playing the opening scene weeping over the little coffin of his 7 year old boy Daniel?), and the retarded young man could have been Oliver Reed in his Hammer days.",1144368000,3,2172,4.452261306532663

I think that when the movie came out (I didn't notice, I had a new baby) there was a lot of hype surrounding the plot twists. Kind of like Sixth Sense, where there's this huge thing at the end. So people were too focused on that, and analyzed the whole movie through that filter. We were fortunate enough NOT to know that, or read any reviews, or hear any hype before watching it. Yah, there are twists. But who cares? If you haven't seen it, don't think about any of the media surrounding it, if you can. Just watch it, and don't anticipate anything while you watch.

The Village is a parable.  It wants viewers to ask themselves questions about the lives they have built and what they are avoiding.  The message is subtle, but powerful.  The filmwork is masterful, and the acting is superb - from Bryce Howard to Joaquin Phoenix to Adrien Brody.

The titular village is a 19th-century hamlet hidden in the woods. The surrounding forest is inhabited by mysterious, dangerous creatures, referred to only in hushed tones as ""Those We Don't Speak Of""; venturing into their domain is forbidden, lest the uneasy peace between the townsfolk and their unhuman neighbors be broken.

As usual, Shyamalan takes his time setting up the story. We watch the quiet daily life of the village: their meals, their labors, their everyday conversations. We are introduced to Ivy, Lucius, and Noah, three young people who will play a central role in the drama. Lucius is utterly fearless, and wishes to enter the woods despite the ban. Ivy, though blind, is resourceful and capable. She is the caretaker of Noah, the village madman, and seems to be the only one who can calm him. Gradually we discover that the town elders are all concealing a secret sorrow, and begin to wonder what it is. As Lucius becomes bolder about wandering into the woods, the creatures begin making more aggressive overtures: skinned animals, marks on doors, culminating with an incursion into the town. By the time one of the villagers is forced to journey into the woods, we are completely absorbed--and this is only the midpoint of the movie. In the end, when the full truth behind the village is revealed, we are forced to reflect on the lengths to which we go to keep our loved ones safe from danger, the cost to them of doing so, and the inevitable loss of innocence that accompanies growing up. When will the younger villagers discover the secret? What will happen to them when they do? Was the way of life the elders established ever worth the sacrifices they made, now that the violence they hoped to escape has broken out in their midst? The movie refuses to answer these questions, instead leaving us to grapple with them.

This is one of Shyamalan's best movies, surpassed only by Unbreakable. It has the simplicity of myth, and its brooding, fairy-tale atmosphere lingers long in the mind.",1143504000,8,2029,4.8414985590778095
2167124,2,B00064LJVO,"With the exception of ""Signs,"" every film that M. Night Shyamalan has made is extremely overrated. ""The Village"" tells the story of a group of people living in an isolated community that is surrounded by woods. Everyone in the village is warned not to go into the woods, which are patrolled by evil ""creatures"" decked out in red hooded capes. Beyond the woods are ""the towns,"" and all anyone knows about the towns is that they are BAD, and NO ONE is supposed to venture into the woods or the towns, or TERRIBLE THINGS WILL HAPPEN!

Sound intriguing? Maybe a little bit...but trust me, Shyamalan manages to screw it up.

""The Village"" has a typical Shyamalan ""twist"" ending, which anyone with half a brain will be able to figure out long before the ""secret"" of the village is revealed to the audience. Overall, though, there isn't anything remotely scary or suspenseful about this movie. There are a few decent performances (Bryce Howard is very convincing in the role of Ivy), but even a collection of very talented actors can't compensate for 108 minutes of Shyamalan crap. In some ways ""The Village"" is even worse than ""The Sixth Sense,"" which is another movie that I hated. There's nothing scary about the endings of these films at all...nothing creepy or supernatural actually happens. (At least there are actual aliens in ""Signs,"" which is probably the only thing that saved that movie.)

I wish Shyamalan could figure out a way to make another thriller/horror movie that was actually SCARY. So far the only film he has succeeded with is ""Signs""...whether he'll ever make another decent movie remains to be seen.",1143331200,2,1617,4.830324909747293

He kept this film so secret that the public had to assume what the story was about from watching the previews. Im sure that everyone thought the movie was a big horror film about Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) venturing into the woods inhabited by monsterous creatures in the 1800s. Well, we the public could not have been more wrong. The movie is actually about a blind girl, Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) venturing into he woods to get medicines to save her fiance, Lucius Hunt, from dying. This movie had its frightening moments, but it was more a love story than a horror film. I'll admit I was disapointed at first because the movie was not what I expected, but I watched it again and realized that it was still a wonderful movie. The only thing that drove me nuts was the ending. It was a cliff hanger! I was impressed by Bryce Dallas Howard's performance. I think she has some really great films ahead of her. Joaquin Phoenix was incredible, as always, even though he did not have that many scenes. The one performance that really caught my attention was Adrien Brody as Noah Percy, the village idiot. He had an absolutely incredible performance. I think he is the only actor that could have pulled off that character that well. I really think he made the movie. The rest of the cast was perfectly casted with Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Brendan Gleeson, and Cherry Jones. I really did enjoy this move, despite its flaws. Im sure this movie will not be apprecitated by everyone, but I thought it was great the way Shaymalan fooled everyone. It was not his best movie, but still pretty good.",1142380800,,1777,4.55625

I don't have a particular knack for this but M. Night Shyamalan made it too easy. All you have to do is watch enough reruns of ""The Twilight Zone"" to figure out his M.O.

At least Rod Serling was merciful enough to condense his entertaining stories to mostly half hour episodes while M. Night Shyamalan unecessarily stretches his into hours.

2167141,4,B00064LJVO,"Released in 2004, ""The Village"" is not a horror film; it's a romantic
mystery. Not a 'mystery' in the sense of a murder mystery, but rather
all-around mysterious. It's a ""What if...?"" tale. The set-up presents
the viewer with a slew of questions, which are all answered in the
final act. The fun of the film is to see if you can figure out the
answers before they are revealed, but that's not the only reason to
appreciate it.

THE PLOT: A small village in Eastern Pennsylvania in 1897 is surrounded
by foreboding woods that harbor mysterious creatures. The villagers are
pretty much imprisoned in the hamlet. Something happens that prompts a
young blind woman to risk a journey through the dangerous woods to find
medicines in another town.

Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard, stars as the innocent blind
protagonist while Joanquin Phoenix plays her strong-and-silent loved
one. Adrien Brody is effective as the detestable village idiot. Also on
hand are Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt as the town elders, who know
more about the situation than they let on.

Director & writer M. Night Shyamalan portrays the locations with an
aura of beauty and mystery. On top of this the score is fittingly
haunting and beautiful. As such, the film is a feast for the eyes and
ears.

There's one potent scene I must mention *** minor spoiler***: Near the
end, the blind girl finally encounters a person from the outer towns.
The contrast of the innocent, secluded blind girl and the outsider is
well captured. The outsider questions the mysterious girl but
ultimately discerns that she is genuine. This is an extraordinary scene
-- ranking up there with the all-time best in cinema (much like the
mysterious Native American bar sequence in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wolfen/dp/B0071I787W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wolfen</a>"").

Although the end-revelation in Shyamalan's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense-Collector-s-Edition-Series/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)</a>"" was
outstanding and arguably better than the the one in ""The Village"", I
personally prefer ""The Village"" overall. Bottom Line: If you have a
taste for surreal mystery and rustic beauty, don't miss out on ""The
Village."" It's a moving, one-of-a-kind picture.

GRADE: B+ or A-

***EXTREME SPOILER ALERT*** Do not read further if you haven't seen the film.

There are two main mysteries: (1.) The nature of the creatures in the
woods, and (2.) the reality of the village itself. The truth about the
""creatures"" may be discerned by some viewers before it is revealed,
but, I gotta admit, my wife and I didn't figure it out (and she's good
at predicting story elements). As to the second mystery: There's no way
a viewer could figure this enigma out as long as s/he accepts that the
story takes place in 1897, which both the film and the DVD jacket
indicate. The only way you could unravel this puzzle is by considering
the possibility that it does not take place in 1897. My Wife and I
never considered this possibility (after all, why would they lie?) and
so were unable to discern the truth.

Beyond all that, the film has a potent subtext. It's an allegorical
slam against socialism in general and, in particular, that
humanity-destroying socialist experiment known as Sweden. Its title is
a riff on Hilary Clinton's socialist polemic ""It takes a village (to
raise a child)"" Shyamalan shows the deadly consequence of entrusting
the care of our children to the socialist state. The movie opens with
the village's burial of a young child and begins the final act with the
death of a product of village upbringing: a dim-witted, craven
murderer.

The movie focuses on the sad fate of the young adults who manage to
survive their socialist upraising while retaining a remnant of hope for
a better future. The pure-hearted and intelligent Ivy is ultimately
seduced by power and welcomed into the inner-circle of village leaders
where she will promote the utopian lie of peace within the community
and chaos outside, meanwhile continuing to bury the young and execute
the useless. Her love interest, the obedient Lucius, is unfit for the
inner circle but will be useful as a goon-enforcer for the village as
he carries on the Elders' practice of terrorizing its own citizenry in
the guise of forest monsters.

As with Sweden, the village is dependant on Western capital. Its
appearance of self-sufficiency is a facade. It was built with, survives
on and is protected by the wealth of capitalists. This can't last
forever, of course. As Margaret Thatcher put it, the problem with
socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.",1141603200,,4757,5.213350785340314
2167142,5,B00064LJVO,"Village starts in the year 1897 where a group of villagers sense some unknown dangers from the woods. There are some unknown creatures lurking in the woods who want the villagers to leave. As i first saw this film, i expected it to be full of spine chilling,scary stuff. But it didn't happen that way. One night when one rang the bell, all villagers are alerted and hide themselves in thier house. There we get a slight glimpse of those red creatures. However soon no one can work out the objective of these creatures. After this time the most beautiful,the most sensitive character ivy takes on the role. Lucius ( joaquin Pheonix) role now pales. As her father tells her it is all a farce and she must get medicines to save lucius.there the real part begins, she braves through the odds of the woods but there is that creature lurking. she saves herself by cleverness and ultimately gets the medicines.

  The reason i liked village was - first of all, it is set in the scenic hills of usa. secondly, the character of ivy is what the film is all about. such a sweet,sensitive character she portrayed the role quintessentially. And adding to it, she is blind. REallly a remarkable performance.",1141516800,2,1193,4.617924528301887
2167143,3,B00064LJVO,"I must say that I have mixed feelings about this movie. When this movie first came out, I heard so much about it that I just had to see it. First, I will say that M. Night Shyamalan gives me the creeps!!!!! Having said that, it didn't stop me from seeing this movie. When I first saw it, I was somewhat disappointed because I expected alot more and I expected more of a ""horror"" type movie. I found it somewhat boring at times, especially being set back way in time. The plus to this movie is the outstanding performance by Bryce Howard.. Ron Howard's daughter. What a great performance she gave us playing a blind girl. The other plus was Sigourney Weaver being in this film for I am a huge fan of hers. I won't go into the details of the movie because some of the other reviews give you all you need to know. One night, with  nothing else playing on t.v., The Village was playing on one of the movie channels so I decided to watch it a 2nd time. I must say that this is one of those movies that is better the 2nd time you watch it. After watching it the 1st time, I would have given it probably a 1 star but now having seen it 3 times, I now give it 3 stars between the acting, the plot and the ""love story"". I hope we see more of Bryce Howard in the future. For anyone who has not seen this movie, I'd suggest renting it and if you are disappointed, watch it again. It is truly better the 2nd time around.",1141430400,2,1408,4.0647482014388485
2167144,1,B00064LJVO,"First of all, Shyamalan is a great filmmaker, but I hated this movie for one reason: the major twist.  Now twists are good, if they are used right, as in The Sixth Sense.  But this twist, and I won't give it away, is so unbelievably ridiculous that it completely negates the entire movie.  There is no plausable way that this movie could work.  The first two thirds of the movie is very entertaining, with good performances by Joaquin Phoenix and a very good performance by Adrien Brody, but once the monsters are out of the picture, it takes a deep dive into awfulness never to recover.  The Village is definitely M. Night's worst film, and it serves as one of the worst films of 2004.  Never in my life have I seen so much potential wasted by such an unbelievable movie.

2167147,4,B00064LJVO,"I finally watched The Village last night....two years after it's release.  Maybe that was a good thing. I still remember everybody saying it was crap, but I don't remember any of the reasons why, so the impact is gone and so I was more open to the film.

The film is great.  I wouldn't say it's M. Night's best because I am still mulling over what the movie is exactly about.  Like, Signs was about faith and coincisence, and Unbreakable was about duality and love...I'm not sure yet what The Village is about.  Innocence, perhaps?

Everybody should know enough from M. Night's past films' patterns not to expect anything going into the movie.  It's not going to be whatever he put on the cover.  I remember how this film was advertised, like it was a horror film....that probably had a lot to do with the negative reviews.  The marketting was attracting people that wanted to see a horror film!  Then when they didn't get one, of course they are going to diss it!  With that in mind, however, I can't think of how to appropriately advertise the film.

I guess The Village is about secrets and innocence.  The selfish things we do to protect others, and run from our own fears.  ""Mama's gonna keep you right here, under her wing. She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing.""  I thought a bit the same as another reviewer who mentioned the post 9-11 USA, and how we are told of evildoers beyond the castle walls.  We are basicly given fear to keep us at home, and not to stray and be open and truly free.  Maybe the metaphor to current political strategies is a stretch, but that is definitely whats going on in the film.  The elders of The Village rule with fear.  Their system of implementing it is near perfect.  The only fault is that the utopia they've created, out of the desire to escape the true harshness of reality, simply cannot stand on its own.  People get hurt and they NEED professional medical treatment....treatment better than 1890's technology can provide.  Just as in real life, at some point somebody is going to say ""hey, why don't I go and see if our neighbor's can help?  Lets see how they handle this sort of injury.""  or they invent something.  In the film's case, a character chooses to seek medicine from outside the village.  Of course, that would destroy the utopia because the boy would see the true world.  He'd become curious, and he'd mention it to the people of the village and the selfish experiment would come to an end.

You see this happen in religious groups, especially fundamentalist and rural religious groups.  At some point, a child will want to explore outside the prescribed worldview and prescribed reality.  People do this for many reasons.  ""Well, all those heathens sure are doing fine without coming to our church....there must be something somebody isn't telling me.""  Of course there's some secrets going on there.  And when the individual is refused permission to venture out into the world, the inventive person finds a way to get out anyway....and attains a form of 'awakening.'  The Village avoids that controversy by choosing the blind character to be the hero and leave the society for badly needed medicine.  She's literally blind.  She can't see the park ranger's land rover.  She can't see his walkie-talkie.  So instead of the bigger, more external conflict which would have ensued had she not been blind, rather we get to see that only the elders have an internal conflict to deal with now.  Should they tell the rest of the villagers about their terrible lie?  How many people will die for the sake of maintaining the peaceful culture they have grown?  With little crime.  Barely any violence. With no money.  Less sin. (some might notice that there is no church in the village)

In the end, nothing is perfect.  Humanity has, as it's nature, a dark side.  Even in the carefully cultivated Oz the elders have created, they can't escape their own tradgic pasts.  And they can't escape the guilt of what they are doing to the innocent and naive. And there is little they can do to keep the people under perfect control.  Humans have faults. Humans have hopes.  Humans have powerful emotions that move them from time to time to press boundaries.  And that is exactly what happens.

The shining ""remainder to the Matrix equation"" in the film is Adrien Brody's character....who suffers from a learning disablity of some sort.  The boy is unruly and wild.  Through this single fluke, this one monkey wrench nature thows in, a heinous act is committed. Violence born out of the human emotion of jealousy.  This starts a chain reaction of emotional decisions.  The emotionally irresponsible boy attempts to kill the man he is jealous of.  The dying man's fiance is moved by love to travel to the end of the world to save her beau. Neither the fear of the outside world which she has been indoctrinated with, nor her own blindness will stop her from doing all that she can to save the man she loves. The idea for the utopia was selfish and futile.  The boundaries we have are the boundaries we tear down.

One person's idea of a perfect world is another person's prison.

One's selfish decisions causually oppress everybody else.

So anyway, the movie isn't about some monsters living in the woods.  If the general public would stop expecting to be spoonfed their entertainment in bite-size, watered-down, and spelled-out pieces then maybe the studios would release better product, like this film.  There's a lot going on in this film.  And much of it is pertinent to all of our lives.  Not just on that political metaphorical level, but in each of our individual human lives.  Parents, teachers, pastors, big brothers, big sisters...any role model or person in any sort of authority....and everybody else...we all have these dilemmas and decisions to make.  The Village is a nice expression based on this concept.",1140480000,4,5877,4.714847590953785

Yes some clever viewers will figure out what lies beyond the ""forbidden woods"" but that in no way takes the power of this movie away. This village is a mirror of our post 911 attacks world. Fear is a tool used by both sides to control us and force us to hand over our reason and power to a few leaders. Notice how the ""terror alert"" color system has unceremoniously disappeared from Fox News lower right screen (since the re-election of Bush in 2004). Has the terror really left or has it morphed into another villain. Understanding human nature at it's best and worst makes this almost prophetic film a must see.",1140480000,,670,4.545454545454546

People watching it for the twist, or for monster attacks, or some such thing, are probably going to get bored waiting for the ending, and they'll miss the fact that the movie itself, all the way through, is wonderful.

Night Shyamalan is one of the few directors working in Hollywood who truly has talent and respect for his craft as evidenced by his masterful films ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"", films with ingenious scripts and sublime yet subdued direction. Alas, ""The Village"" is not on par with these films, not by far. Shyamalan was already begining to falter with his previous film ""Signs"" which miscast Mel Gibson in a serious role way above his dramatic abilities and which had a tone that wavered between pretentious and hammy (and let's not even mention the twist ending of that movie). ""The Village"" is even worse than ""Signs"" as it is a film that is overly pretentious, bland, po-faced and above all, handled with a hand so heavy that the film is crushed under its weight. The story about a secluded community in Pennsylvania in the 19th century which begins to experience terrifying trespasses from mysterious creatures who live in the surrounding woods, is simple and at first, intriguing. But the stilted dialogue, portentous tone and crawling pace, deaden every inch of luster out of the premise, and to make matters worse, the plot takes a harrowingly stupid turn at the end that renders the whole film pointless and ridiculously self-important. With bland performances from an all star cast, Shyamalan's pretentious handling and a twist at the end that is so ludicrous it is almost insulting, the film is a mess from beginning to end, which is something that is very painful to experience especially knowing what Shyamalan is capable of in terms of pure cinematic genius.

Who does this polyp thinks he is?? Steven Spielberg?

It's irritating enough having to put up with his obnoxious cameos on every junk he makes. I've seen more than I can handle. Unbreakable was a terrible film through and through, everyone speaks in whispers, the storyline is absurd and feels uncontrollably extended, and not even a GREAT CASTING like that of Bruce Willis and Samuel L.

I have no problem with the twist ending even though it was a little dissapointing.  With that said here is the problem with this film.  In the trailer, or somewhere before this movie was released, the synopsis stated specifically this story takes place in the year 1897.  I was watching this with my wife and the sound effects and visuals of this film not to mention the colors were outstanding.  But about a quarter of the way through this film I realized it actually took place in modern times.  But then they actually reveal that the monsters were fake and showed the costume in that shed.  This was shown too early.  But then they go on with this great adventure into the woods when you already know there are no monsters, but you are still hoping something great will happen.  When we find out what most people had already figured out shortly into the film that the story took place in modern day we are expecting the big bang.  But it doesn't come.  You have the director's voice in the film as someone working in this military area and I am thinking ok, top secret military area:  Hey the military must be doing some secret experiments with genetically eng lifeforms to use for soldiers, which would explain the monsters in the woods, but of course this is not even the case or if it is we are not told.  All we know is that there is this secret gov't territory that we have no idea why it is there.

The Bottem line the synopsis stated the film takes place in the year 1897 when it clearly didn't.  If the synopsis never would have stated this I would have few problems with this film.  And what makes it even sadder is the fact that they didn't need to put the date in the synopsis; just show the village and people would have instantly guessed this takes place in the late 19th century.

Though not as bad as Cold creek manor as far as no story and nt as insulting to the audience as High Tension which didn't care about tying everything together to make sense, The Village did tie everything together but the company that released this film lied in the synopsis especially when they didn't have to.  This is unforgivable.  I would still recommend renting this movie just to see the visuals and great acting.  when it is over you can use your own imagination (something the filmakers lacked in this film) to have any kind of ending  you wish.  You can say, yeah those monsters were pretty cool, they were creatures that evolved over time from something someting and they declared war on the village and the town had to fight hundreds of them off by the end of the film showing no clear winner, but leaving room for a sequel.

The ads for this film depicted it as a horror- style scare fest. It is certainly NOT, although a few scenes will have you tense.

And unlike the neatly tied loose ends in ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs,"" this film leaves a few strings flapping in the breeze. (SPOILER) So, why on Earth did a Villiage Elder go to the extreme of executing all those animals? Just to scare it's young 'uns back in line? Very illogical!

Also, doesn't this film just cater to the radical fringe, ""X-Files"" paranoia crowd... those who believe that Bush or the CIA orchestrated 9/11, just to strip away certain civil liberties? I suppose Al-Qaeda is actually harmless?

I guess the ""grassy knoll"" has become too boring for all the conspiracy theorists.

Still, I'm forced to give the disappointing film 3 stars... due to the protagonist heroine, and her valiant journey... and how we care for her. It's an involved and intelligent story, with a ""Twilight Zone"" flavor. If only it didn't leave me feeling ""cheated!""

Cast:  Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleeson, Judy Greer, Cherry Jones.

Running Time:  108 minutes

Rated PG-13 for a scene of violence, intense situations, and brief language.

M. Night Shyamalan definitely did himself a disservice in releasing ""The Sixth Sense"". Brilliant as the film was, its ""twist"" ending was so powerful that audiences the world over expected nothing less from the talented young director. And so, Shyamalan has been trying with every single outing since to recapture that sense of awe.  ""Signs"", another incredibly produced chiller with a magnificent resolution showed his growth both as a screenwriter and director.  With ""The Village"", the director attempts to bring several different layers into the film (including perhaps the September 11, 2001 inspired innocence versus corruption theme), but eventually this stylish shocker falls flat on its face due to a disoriented finale.  The movie revolves around a community which is almost Amish in its characteristics, as the villagers are self sufficient in their world. It features a great cast (led by William Hurt, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, Sigourney Weaver and Brendon Gleeson); however, the talent is so wastefully squandered with too rare, fleeting moments of interaction.

The elders of the community (Hurt, Weaver, Gleeson and others) have prohibited the villagers to venture into the surrounding woods, as there are ""Creatures of which we do not speak"" living within. They wear red hoods and red is a color which they are not allowed to cast their eyes upon. The community is in turn paralyzed by fear. As history would have it, there has been bad, spilt blood with these creatures and a truce was called. The promise of the truce is that neither party is not allowed to set foot into the other's territory, or else it will be considered void.  When one of the villagers fall victim to a violent crime, the town turns to a blind woman named Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) to venture into the woods and retrieve medicine from a neighboring settlement.

""The Village"" begins ominous and promising, yet there are only a few genuine scenes which make you jump out of your skin. But at the core of all the monsters, darkness, and hysteria is a deeply moving love story between Luscious (Joaquin Phoenix) and Ivy, which the Shyamalan allocates a good deal of time to gain speed as the spookier stuff rolls out. At its heart, ""The Village"" is a costume drama exploring the microcosm of this tiny population that is entirely reliant on each other.  The film is most appealing stepping back and watching these characters interact, captured with Shyamalan's meticulous, mannered camera moves and pace, never breathing too deeply or trying too hard, outside of his clunky dialog.  Despite his failings as writer here, director Shymalan and his cinematographer do well here and produce a film that looks great and manages to produce some images that are memorable and effective.

The cast try hard but, with few characters to go around, many of their characters are left underdeveloped and enigmatic.  Phoenix's performance is fitting to the slow tone of the film and he tries hard but he is betrayed and left with nothing to do. Howard steals the film with stupendous effectiveness and charm.  Her actions may grate as they seem so very unlikely but her actual performance is very good and she makes a good heart of the film once she is moved into that position in the second half. Brody is only adequate, but is just a plot device to get to the twist. Hurt is strong and delivers well, but people like Weaver and Gleeson really deserve better; they have nothing to do and what little material they have to work with (e.g. Weaver and Hurt's affection) is only out there to fill and distract.  A visually stunning and moderately scary political stab at the genre, yet overall the film leaves the audience with a strange sense of deception.",1135728000,2,4004,4.976011994002999
2167159,4,B00064LJVO,"""The Village"" takes people in different ways; some found it intriguing, others hated it for a surprise ending that seemed borrowed or transparent. I was surprised at the revelations at the film's end, and enjoyed the whole premise, because the director has crafted a complete and atmospheric setting that appeals to someone willing to think a little bit.

Whether or not one sees the plot-twist coming, it's no great fault to ask the question: is the idea of a community in the pastoral embrace of nineteenth century America, with its formal speech and folksy traditions, a worthwhile pursuit in a bewildering, modern time? Moviegoers do not question whether the worlds of Lucas or Tolkien can actually exist - they accept the idea and enjoy the details. Similarily, M. Night Shyamalan asks us to think about how our society (or any society) holds itself together for the benefit of all. In the village, people abide by customs that define conduct and action. There exist contrivances to sustain people's beliefs and adherence to custom - as there are in any society. So whether or not the menace surrounding the village is real, the larger point is that people make degrees of  sacrifices to keep what is good in their lives.

A good film can, in the right way, stimulate questions long after the closing credits have rolled. Some viewers questioned how it was that the villagers could create a world without modern conveniences, even asking how the talismanic yellow hoods were manufactured without advanced textiles. Interesting questions, but completely beside the point. One should ask, would the village ""evolve,"" as all societies do? Or, how would the elders reveal to their descendants the secret that keeps the village intact? Perhaps, after all the angles are examined, the best way to view ""The Village"" is as a set-piece, existing in time and yet timeless.

The acting is fine overall. I think that William Hurt excels at this sort of restrained, yet passionate character. Joaquin Phoenix proves that he can dial into a deep reservoir of emotion without resorting to hysterics. Adrian Brody is excellent as the disturbed young man whose eccentricities redefine the term ""village idiot."" The best acting comes from Bryce Dallas Howard, whose subtlety and emotion hints at even better work to come. The dialog, contrary to some opinions, is part of what makes this village world work. People have more time for talking (absent TV!) and so make their thoughts known in a way that seems quaint to our ears. But we once did speak in these slow, restrained and simpler ways; just peruse any of Lincoln's writings, or Whitman's poetry. The writing and rationale for ""The Village"" isn't an attempt to make the past seem familiar (like British accents for Roman spectacles); it's a conscious decision to remake thought and life based on long-ago abandoned values.",1135641600,5,2866,5.0020964360587
2167160,3,B00064LJVO,"This movie certainly isn't bad, the first half of it was quite strong.  The characters and their society fleshed out nicely, a good job was done building tension.  I have to admit some of the actors did not seem like the best pick for their roles, but the acting was fine.  The concept behind this film is an interesting one, but unfortunately not pulled off as well as it could have been.  The end of the movie has a very rushed through feel, and doesn't give a feeling of closure.  I can't go into too many details because it would give away the twist, but this movie could have gotten very philosophical at the end, but instead left me feeling like it simply didn't live up to its potential.",1135555200,2,694,4.348837209302325
2167171,2,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan fooled me completely with his other, more masterful films, such as the Sixth Sense.  Critics had panned THE VILLAGE but considering his track record, I decided to give this work a chance.

Regarding the big 'surprise ending,' I more-or-less had it figured out halfway through as, apparently did many viewers.  In any event, it wasn't much of a revelation and it isn't much of a Village either.

Imagine a community that appears to have no contact with the outside world and be totally, totally agrarian.  Yet it has bone china, paper, kerosene, ink, pneumatically-carved tombstones, and every metal tool imaginable (and with no warehouses).  The credibility is stretched and broken within moments.

But, were you to suspend disbelief and just go with the one-note plotline about needing to pass through a monster-laden forest and get medicine, you'd still have to endure the badly stilted dialogue, glacial pace, and acting so understated that it made narcoleptics seem like crazed caffeine fiends.

Yes, the film has strengths.  Somehow, the Village elder played by William Hurt is engaging.  And the cold, grey, damp atmosphere of suspense and dread is the high point of The Village.

Still, it wasn't scary, wasn't a surprise, and the love story motif was simplistic and thin.  Can't say I recommend this one.",1135296000,3,1331,5.082949308755761
2167172,5,B00064LJVO,"I saw this at a late drive-in showing the first time, which was an awesome setting for an outdoorsy scary movie, and I loved it for the scary thrill without evil horror.  And of course the themes of love and courage left me with a content feeling afterwards.  And the plot twist, I was looking for it but didn't see it coming, I love that.

I just rented it with friends last weekend to see it for my second time, their first.  And even though of course I knew what was going to happen, I found myself squeezing a hand and covering my eyes as if it was my first time.  But I also had the advantage of knowing when my favorite parts were coming.  And another deeply beautiful theme we noticed this time around was that sorrow is part of life, not a product of environment.  Take it as it comes, and celebrate the good when it comes as well.  Anyway, I way highly recommend this movie - I'm giving it as Christmas gifts to several people!",1133481600,2,936,4.219101123595506

I was concerned that knowing of Mr. Shyamalan and his work that he could not fool me again but I was wrong.  There are only a few times writers have knocked me off my seat at the end of a performance and this film was one.  The Sixth Sense, Hide and Seek and broadway's Iceman Cometh are the few other times I have ever felt the chill and enjoyment of a priceless piece of work that moves you at the end.  I believe that it is the way a film can bring you to tears, shock you or amaze the senses to the point you are thinking about it for days after that makes a work of art priceless.  Shyamalan has mastered this craft.  Excellent!!!!",1133481600,,707,4.124087591240876

I love the concepts and values interwoven in the strange plots of the director, who has become famous for twists and shocks. I have to admit that the idea of creatures in the woods frightened me, however, the idea of losing what's dearest--one's character--was more upsetting. I love the characters, the score, and the plot and hope that everyone will give this movie a chance.",1133395200,2,551,4.690721649484536

But I did not ask any questions or even read reviews or spoilers about this movie.  I just happened to rent it one day because I'd seen every thing else at the time.  I expected to simply see a scary movie about scary things with a predictable twist.  I was surprised and I did have a couple scared moments there.  I have to completely agree with other reviews, that you cannot watch this movie knowing the ending or even much about a few other surprises in the movie.  You will not enjoy it.

I will not anyway spoil the movie with hints of possible twists, but I will say that the one surprise you may find is one another reviewer revealed.  I watched the movie expecting the only performance to remember would be Joaquin Phoenix.  I was very surprised to be completely on the edge of my seat by the performance of Bryce Dallas Howard (Ivy).  At first I honestly didn't expect much from her character, but hers is the one I remember best from the movie and the reason I watched it again.  It is a great break out performance for her.

Again, don't find out the ending before you watch it.  Go into it with an open mind.  Then maybe you will be surprised and a little scared by a least one of the twists.",1133049600,,1305,4.252032520325203
2167177,5,B00064LJVO,"`The Village' is the most horrifying of Shyamalan's film because it is possible.  At the core of the story are the lies, lies which adults perpetrate on their children.  Within an insulated society, a council-a junta-fabricate an enemy, an evil-an insidious bedtime horror to keep their children safe.  Safe?  Safe from the outside world, of course.

The film is about the perversion of reality.  Lie to create safety-and obedience, but the safety is illusionary.  Murder is still a real possibility, and also with this seclusion comes the penalty of not being about to cure common physical ailments.  No one is allowed or able to go out to the `towns' because of those `that can't not be named'

This story is incredibly Orwellian-even totalitarian:  rule through the use of fear.  `The Village' also has a `Shirley Jackson' feel and is reminiscent of her `The Lottery.'  And, as far as I am concerned, Shyamalan best effort so far.",1132617600,6,933,4.910256410256411

Boring characters, except the lead girl, she was the only saving grace in the film, and the only convincing character. That's my opinion. Not a horrible movie, but certainly not what it was hyped to be in the previews and commercials. It's not what you might expect.

Dallas Bryce-Howard is incredible, and you basically have to fall in love with her character.  The script, the scenery, the acting, the dialogue is all entrancing.  Don't listen to the haters who didn't like the ending (I'm being purposely vague)  What does it really matter about the ending if you enjoyed the movie up to that point anyway? You telling me that it retroactively erased your previous enjoyment or suspense? PLEASE!

As for people that go around spoiling movies, they are cheating people out of the possiblity of a really cool viewing experience.

2167191,1,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan is a highly original director who makes cameos in all his own films. This is an homage to Hitchcock, not a ripoff. (And if you don't know who Hitchcock is, well in that case, the cameos were an original idea of Shyamalan's.)

Shyamalan is also a highly original writer who borrows all his ideas from old Twilight Zone episodes and other assorted sources. These are all homages also. Homages are something that great directors do, and this proves Shyamalan is a great director. Besides, he puts these things in a different order, which takes a lot of skill, darn it.

EXTREME SPOILER WARNING

The Village is a movie about people who spend most of their time speaking about ""the things we don't speak of"". Half of these people are ""Elders"", who spend all their time telling elaborate lies to their children, because they care about them so much. Sort of the way Shyamalan cares about his audience.

The Elders hate the wickedness of violence, which is why they regularly dress up as monsters and scare the living cr@p out of their children. This infliction of random fear is actually profoundly symbolic of Shyamalan's homage to himself and his profound ability to impose random fears free from the constraints of meaning.

The Elders are deeply compassionate people who bribed airlines to avoid flying over their village, and who send blind girls through pit-infested woods to fetch medicine to maybe heal wounds caused by the Elders own deeply compassionate way of letting retarded people run around with knives. The Elders themselves could not fetch the medicines because they took an oath of stupidity. By breaking the seal on this DVD you yourself automatically agree to take this same oath of stupidity.

The Village People in this film speak a version of English that has never before been spoken, because... um... well you might see the twist coming otherwise. If you saw the twist coming you might not stick around to see Shyamalan's cameo, which was casually planned very carefully to prove that Shyamalan doesn't really want to do the cameo, because he is quite humble after all, which he proves by only showing his face in a reflection after several minutes of suspenseful buildup which was just due to an editing accident.

The advertisement for this film shows Shyamalan's hands, in a gesture of supreme sacrifice, ""giving"" you the movie, for $14. You should thank him for thinking of you at all.",1131235200,20,2427,4.861985472154964
2167192,5,B00064LJVO,"First of all I am going to say ""The Village"" is an amazing masterpiece that shows what M. Night is capable of doing for audiences.  He doesn't show blood and gore which I think ruins a movie.  All scary movies are just blood and gore.  BORING!!!  WHERE'S THE PLOT???  ""The Village"" does have mild violence, but if most directors where doing that same scene with Noah confronting Lucius, there would've been the shot of a wall with blood being splattered all over it.  Second, I am a huge M. Night fan that will defend him from idiots that don't even know when a good movie is right in front of them.

""The Village"" has many wonderful aspects that involve love and innocense.  For goodness sakes listen to the way they speak!  To me thats more interesting than listening to them talk normal.  Which sounds better?  ""The creatures killed it."" or ""Those we don't speak of killed it.""  My point is, the dialogue shows deeper meaning instead of everyday language.  Its what makes the movie unique and I think it adds more to the fact it's a love story, like the way Shakespere speaks.  I'm also pretty sure everyone, that is the smart ones, could understand the words in ""The Village"".

If you are really older than 5 years old and know how to pay attention then you also picked up on the fact that two people are in love and will do anything to stay together.  When Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) gets stabbed and the tables turn to Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) she must venture outside of Covington Woods to get help.  Lots of stupid people seem to not understand this.  Here it is in a short summary:  THEY ARE IN LOVE!!!  DUH!!!  Also people think it's funny to watch a blind girl struggle through a forest shes never been to while being chased by a strange creature.  Well I hope those people do go blind and get chased by a murderer, then maybe the scene with Ivy and the Those We Don't Speak Of won't be as funny.

Also, I am sick of people complaining about the ending.  So I put down my opinion on why the movie concluded the way it did so maybe the retards who don't understand finally know what the message of ""The Village"" is.

SPOILER!!!  DO NOT CONTINUE IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN ""THE VILLAGE""!

There is no other way to end this movie, and I will agree with some people that they could guess the twist, but there was more then one twist, which all had a point, and I stand with M. Night all the way on how this film ended.

Twist Number 1:  The creatures not being real had to be revealed because as Edward Walker says, ""Do you plan to live forever?""  They had to tell Ivy sooner or later because if all the elders died and they didn't tell their secret, then the creatures would slowly disappear from existance.  This would then lead to people questioning about the creatures and whether or not they are still there, or somebody might find out it is not real, causing everyone to leave and explore the outside world.  The creatures had to be made up so no one would leave Covington Woods and experience the tragedy the elders felt when they lived in the towns.

Twist Number 2:  Noah Percy (Adrien Brody) was disguised as a creature who chased around Ivy in the woods.  Since Ivy didn't know it was Noah she led him to a pit (a DEEP pit) and allowed him to fall in, ending his life.  If you want to say Covington Woods was considered a ""utopia"" then hopefully you understand why Noah had to die.  I don't believe the town was a utopia but it did have signs of one.  Noah was causing problems from the very beginning.  He would cross the forbidden line and even get excited when the creatures would arise.  Even if the creatures were real then he was going to cause the town peril because he was a trouble maker.  Well in the case of fake creatures, it was a sad thing to see Noah take his last breath but it was for the good.  He would've caused the secret of the village to be revealed if he was still alive by breaking the rules and not listening to his friends.  This, I believe, is why Noah Percy was let go.

Twist Number 3:  Finally the twist that shocked me and hopefully others.  It is common day outside the walls of Covington Woods .  I don't think there was really was a strong point to the normal day thing, but what I got out of it was that the elders were frightened from their everyday world and wanted to escape.  They wanted a world of innocense and that even meant leaving all the simplicity of the common world and even creating creatures so the future villagers wouldn't go back to what they feared.  It shows what people will do for protection and love.

There is also a lot of complaining about the movie not being scary.  Well I know M. Night is more of a thriller movie type instead of horror, so I knew there were going to be moments in the theater were I was going to feel uneasy.  And yes, the preview did make ""The Village"" look like it was going to be scary, but it's M. Night's fourth movie!  We all should know by now how he directs movies and has way more suspense and unknown instead ""jump out of your seat scares"".

There is one more thing I have to say.  THE ACTING WAS SUPERB AND BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD IS AN EXTREMELEY TALENTED ACTRESS AND ANYONE WHO MOCKS HER IS A LOSER BECAUSE DID THEY GET THE PART OF IVY???  NO!!!  ALSO...  M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN HAS A GIFT FOR MOVIE MAKING AND ANYONE WHO STILL DISAGREES AFTER READING WHAT I CALL ""THE VILLAGE SUMMARY FOR DUMMIES"" KEEP POSTING YOUR COMMENTS I LIKE TO SEE HOW  CLUELESS PEOPLE ARE.

I also strongly believe in the saying, ""You can't please everybody.""  But if you're going to hate ""The Village"" please come back with a better excuse then, ""The twist sucked.""  There is more to the story.

I love Shyamalan's other films, especially Signs, which was such an underrated film in its beauty and artistry, but this one, YIKES! I have tried very hard to like this movie but after viewing two times, there is hardly anything positive I can think to say except that I did get a good nap during my second viewing.  To begin with, didn't anyone notice that the acting is absolutely ATROCIOUS?? I understand it must have been nearly impossible to act this script with any kind of realism at all but I just couldn't get past the monotone, unnatural, unrealistic way of speaking exibited by each of these characters. (I must fault the director here since each and every character has this blahhh  way of talking, it's obvious they were all told to perform the characters this way). Now, getting to the dialogue,  I don't care what century you're living in, NOBODY, NOT NOBODY, speaks casual conversation the way the dialogue is scripted in this one, not even going back to medieval times. The dialogue is so forced, so phony, so contrived, it is almost hard to listen to without chuckling. (The oh-so-great line and delivery of ""the young man...is not aware...of your...intentions..."") or some such garbage that sticks out in my mind as one of many times that I laughed outloud at the horrid writing and acting. And finally, the main character Ivy is scary to look at as her corpse-white face and vacant, dead eyes menace the screen while attempting to have the audience actually like her. Like her? I couldn't wait to see her filleted in the woods out of pure disgust at her lousy acting and blank, mannequin-inspired face. This could have been a good movie because the concept is very interesting but even if people really did decide to live a ""simpler life"" it would never require them to adopt quasi-Shakespearean speech. Does thou not agree? The only purpose to this language is to fool the audience into believing the characters are living in the 19th century but beyond that, there is no logical reason they would effect this dialect. So, in short, good premise, interesting idea, could have been great, but fails pathetically. ""Those which we don't speak of"" for me ain't the monsters in the woods, but those on the screen that took my ten bucks and haunt my cable channels.",1129075200,3,2487,4.75
2167198,2,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan's movies are noted for their surprise endings, but in this instance, the writer-director cheats the moviegoer bigtime.  The story concerns a cult of people who have formed a village in an isolated rural area to separate themselves from an outside world where evil is rampant, not unlike Brigadoon. We are led to believe both by the villagers' clothes and by dates on local cemetery tombstones (a cemetery which in itself becomes suspect or incredible when we learn the elders' real secrets) that the story is set around the turn of the century.

The real cheating, though, comes from the dialogue Night has written. It is so arch and unnatural that it would not be out of place in some 1950's Hollywood biblical or medieval epic. Fortunately, Night has a highly talented cast to try to make his odd sentence structures seem natural, even if the cast doesn't altogether succeed.

The point of this stilted dialogue is to further mislead us into believing that we are dealing with some long-ago place and time. (Second-time viewers should listen very carefully, not to what is being said but to HOW it is being said.)

The movie has other mysteries revealed regarding alleged flesh-eating monsters who live outside the village confines and who keep the youngsters fearful from exploring the outside world, thus keeping the village intact.

Some of the romantic entanglements and subsequent jealousies are interesting, particularly one that leads to an attempted murder. Night's suggestion here (and rightly so) is that one cannot really isolate oneself from evil, since evil is unfortunately part of the human condition. Thus, ""The Village"" does at least provide some food for thought.",1128816000,3,1702,5.086021505376344

2167210,5,B00064LJVO,"I saw The Village the day it came out.  From the very ambiguous previews I saw months before, I was very excited for another movie from M. Night Shyamalan.  After the movie was over, I left the theater stunned by what an amazing character portrait I had just witnessed.  In fact, I couldn't wait until I could see it again.  By the end of the weekend, word had spread that this movie was horrible.  I even heard people say that M. Night Shyamalan had lost his touch.  Wait a minute.  Did they see the same movie that I saw days before?  Though critics dogged it and audiences hated on it, I fell in love with the characters, love story, and the simple, effective dialogue.

I can't help but feel sorry for poor M. Night Shyamalan.  Here he is trying to break out of his must-have-a-bigger-and-better-twist-ending shell, but he can't since all anyone wants from him is that climactic twist that leaves your head spinning. (By the way, I loved Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense, and Signs equally as much as The Village.)  The love story between a young blind girl and an older simpleton-like man is captivating all by itself.  The girl, Ivy, is wise beyond her years; she sees things that the seeing can't even see.  One thing she captures is the essence of the quiet worker Lucius.  They fall in love and share a sweet, quiet romance despite the fact that creepy monsters are haunting the small town.  It's beautiful.  It's clever.  It's wonderful writing, directing, and acting.

So no, the ""twist"" wasn't as mind blowing as when Bruce Willis found out he was dead the whole time.  And no, the movie didn't amaze audiences by showing that perhaps everything happens for a reason.  But did anyone ever consider that Shyamalan didn't want to scare you out of your seat?  What if he just wanted to tell a simple love story with a creepy setting and a haunting realization that the Elders wanted to keep their world as isolated as possible to numb the pain of their pasts?  The movie does all of this and more.  I recommend this movie to anyone with a mind open enough to forget that a one trick pony can only do the same trick, in this case the most shocking twist ending, so many times before it gets old.  I say, Shyamalan's latest trick is his best yet.",1128297600,7,2249,4.496296296296296

2167217,2,B00064LJVO,"I'm a big M. Night Shyamalan fan. Who isn't? Clearly, the man has oodles of talent, and possesses the happy knack of being able to exact wonderfully original performances from the big stars that want to do his movies. On paper, then, The Village, should have been an excellent film, with its compelling pseudo-horror premise, a cast roster with talented names like John Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Joaquin Phoenix, and M. Night Shyamalan directing his own screenplay.

However.

It is said that somewhere between truth and untruth lies fiction. It could be said that somewhere between bad and reprehensible lies The Village. I have never seen such a promising movie deliver so very little - and, even more annoyingly - deliver it so sloppily.

The first and most disheartening problem with this picture is the direction. M. Night Shyamalan appears to be going for the 'glossy TV Series' feel, as opposed to anything atmospheric or real. For a town of pilgrims, the inhabitants of The VIllage seem to live in cleanliness and harmony. While this does have a bearing on the ending, for the most part of the movie, the plastic-fantastic semi-real visuals and frankly standard-fare camerawork negate any sense of isolation or pilgrimage that we might have felt (and, I am sure, Shyamalan intends us to feel) for the protagonists. We see monsters in most of their glory far too early on, and where this has worked before (the little girl ghost in The Sixth Sense), it fails here since the mosnters are specifically designed with some kind of revolting knock-off Tolkien Orc template in mind. The look like the Trolls in 'Willow', except more comical. And in a movie of this nature (where the unseen and undiscussed is the source of all the tension) that's a bad thing.

Performances are humdrum at best (Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard) and, at worst, stereotyped and banal (Brendan Gleeson and Adrien Brody, who looks like he's making fun as opposed to having fun). Bryce Dallas Howard is passable - almost good - as Ivy, and saves this movie from a one-star rating, but she's just not believable as blind. Weaver and Hurt are totally wasted with a lousy, lousy script that contains no life or characterisation, and the tone of the cast in general matches that of the picture as a whole - kind of lifeless.

And that, coupled with the fact that M. Night Shyamalan seems to be in love with his own image here (I can't tell you how the script may have benefitted from a couple more rewrites, ditto the direction - I guess he just doesn't think he can do any wrong!) means that, far from being the suspenseful and beautifully-shot movie that has become M. Night Shyamalan's trademark, it falls very far and very flat on its dull, predictable face.

One to avoid at all costs, rent ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs"" instead.",1127174400,2,2832,4.78118609406953

2167219,5,B00064LJVO,"This was one of the best movies I've seen in years -- at least SOMEONE in Hollywood is making movies with original ideas instead of churning out boring sequel after boring sequel or making ""new"" movies out of old television shows. No, it is not a true horror film, but the whole movie is suffused with a palpable unease and tension, and several moments made me gasp. Anyone looking for a gore fest or a ""Jason"" redux should look elsewhere, but they'd overlook a spectacular film in the process. As with any psychological thriller, it's not so much whether the monsters are actually scary, but what effect they have on the people who are afraid of them that matters most.

It's a shame, more than anything, that the expectation of a surprise ending so motivates many of the viewers. I didn't know going in that this movie has a twist at the end, and I was better off not expecting it. It seems subtle at first, but when you consider the layers upon layers that have ripple effects, it's really quite extraordinary. (Like any of his movies, discussing these various facets here would destroy much of the effect for the new viewer, but consider Noah's reactions through the film, for example, in light of the knowledge that we learn at the end that he'd had, even through a childlike mind's understanding. Or why Walker couldn't go... And so many others, all brilliant.)

As another reviewer mentioned, no one ties together every last line of a movie at the end like Shyamalan -- there's not a throwaway line or gesture throughout the movie. The film work is exquisite, the actors are impeccable (and quite a cast.... Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, and Bryce Howard in a stunning debut), and the story quite intriguing.

It turned out to be quite a thrill, especially not knowing anything about it and not having read any reviews about it.  I was skeptical yet hopeful for some goosebumps.  I was not disappointed.

He continues certain themes.  His use of color is significant and his settings and overall mood are top-notch.  Hard to imagine a better cinematographer out there in terms of setting.  The premise is almost fairy tale like.  A village lives in fear of ""monsters"" beyond its borders in the woods, hearkening back to the childhood fears of most everybody.

As with any community there are always those curious about what is on the outside.  One brave soul decides he wishes to venture out beyond the borders.  And so begins the adventure.  It may not sound like much but I found it to be plenty spine tingling to watch and suspenseful enough to keep me interested.  And yes, once again, the ending was unexpected.

Other peeple went in ""plot-guessing"", simply making a game out of trying to figure out the plot twist. Those people were also disappointed by the relatively guessable twist.

However, I watched the movie apart from all preconceptions. I watched it as I would an independant movie from an unknown director. And it was a simple amazing film. The cinemetography is gorgeous - sweeping, clean, and photographically amazing - it captures the cold, rough atmosphere of the town perfectly. The acting is amazing - people have often said the lines seem wooden - when you take into account that the characters are actually 20th century people who have to speak in old english, you realize they are actually acting superbly. And the musical score is one of the best of the past 3 years, rivaled only by LOTR.

If we go into a room expecting to see God and instead find $100,000,000, we will be disappointed. The same happened with ""the Village"".

True: The Sixth Sense was a genuinely absorbing and effective piece of movie-making. It will continue to be watched for a long time, and deservedly so. True too: Shyamalan has a good eye, and some of the shots were ravishing. True as well: Bryce Dallas Howard is lovely and does as much with her as one could hope in the midst of such drivel. We could even add that the premise has a good deal of potential, and in the hands of a writer/director who actually had something to say, it might have been the basis of a perfectly good movie. Instead, we got a plot filled with gaping holes, dialogue mostly so wooden and unbelievable that it must have pained the good actors in this traffic accident to deliver it, and -- worst of all -- an utter lack of any real suspense.

2167228,5,B00064LJVO,"""The Village"", as is probably known to everyone, centers on an isolated, 1800s/early 1900-ish village surrounded on all sides by dense forest, and the truce that exists between the human inhabitants of the village and the strange inhuman creatures that make the forest their home.

  Having existed in its current position for ages with no contact with the outside world, the younger residents of the village have started to grow curious about this outside world they've heard of only through rumors and passed-down warnings, and some are beginning to question the wisdom of staying completely cut off from the outside, especially as in cases where the village's supplies of certain essentials such as medicines have started running out.  As this has been a growing source of....'discontent' may be too strong a word, more like 'disagreement'..in the village for some years, it's not having a debilitating effect on the little community.  What does have a drastic and panic-inducing effect is when it appears that some among the humans have broken the peace pact with the creatures, and the creatures begin to make their appearances on the outskirts of the village and even within the village itself.

  There are more than one major twists in the movie, and other smaller ones.  Of the two major twistpoints, one I'd guessed at, although it unfolded in a manner quite differently than I'd figured it would, and the other caught me 100% offguard.  This is a thoughtful and atmospheric shocker, outstandingly handled in every respect (not least of all the multiple high-caliber performances).  M. Night Shymalan has yet to deliver a bad or even a merely average movie (although a lot of people in the media seem to be holding their breath and hoping he does, for some reason), and ""The Village"", along with ""Unbreakable"", is one of his two best in my opinion.

Though it's sure not to be everyone's cup of tea, M Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" plays like a good old-fashioned ""Twilight Zone"" episode all done up in period costume and expanded out to feature film length.

Set in the late 1800's, the story - which plays like a cross between ""The Crucible"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" - takes place in a small village that has been cut off from the outside world by strange and potentially deadly creatures who inhabit the woods nearby.  These mysterious figures - referred to by the townsfolk as Those We Don't Speak Of - have made some sort of pact with the humans to the effect that they will leave the people alone if the people leave them alone.  However, one individual in the town - a young man named Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) - has an aching desire to leave the village and explore the world beyond the parameters of the woods.  It is that unprecedented willingness to cross the barrier and violate the pact that sets the story in motion.

""The Village"" is obviously intended to be an allegory about how humans use fear of the unknown to keep themselves from venturing out to worlds beyond their own, and, concomitantly, to justify hiding from the ugliness of life.  The film has the stripped-down look and feel of a morality play performed on a stage whose sets are simple and stark and whose characters and dialogue are weighted down with heavy symbolic value.  ""The Village"" requires patience from the audience and an acceptance going into the film that this will not be a horror movie in the traditional sense - i.e. one filled with gore and grue or high-octane chills and thrills - but rather a subdued exercise in portentousness and understated suggestion.  In this respect, the movie works quite well.

Heavily reliant as it is on imagery and mood to achieve its effects, this is less an actor's film that it is a director's, but Phoenix, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Adrien Brody as the literal village idiot, deliver reasonably compelling performances.  But it is Bryce Dallas Howard, as a young blind woman sent into the forest on a danger-filled mission to bring help back from town, who shines in the film.

Shyamalan has made quite a lucrative career out of movies that use indirection rather than explicitness to generate their suspense.  That ""The Village"" is the weakest of those films thus far (""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"" are more fully realized works), doesn't diminish the fact that those willing to give it a chance may find it to be a rewarding experience.",1124668800,5,2542,4.736961451247166

The storyline is clever as you would expect from a M. Night Shyalmalan film. I won't go into the actual storyline here as it has been done before. I just have a few things that I would like to say. Firstly, I think Ivy is  a wonderful character and the acting here is superb. Parts of the film were a bit unbelievable for me. There was some strong minded strong characters, i.e. Lucies and Ivy who are prepared to blindly follow the course of the elders in the village.

In fact I believe that Lucies had the secret of the elders guessed and this is why he seems so brave to others and why he asks to leave the village. It is almost like he is inviting them to tell him.

The whole concept of the film is a very interesting one, which shows how people might live in order to avoid the evil person in the world. This is perhaps similar to the Beach.

Well, visually this movie is fantastic. It's atmospheric, spooky, vivid and wonderfully shot. The score is also tremendous and deserves to be part of a more fulfilling movie. I liked the characters. I felt moved during the movie. I thought it was interesting. But The Village was a total let down. I still remember how cool, original, mysterious and exciting this movie looked and how I waited for it to come out. Then it comes out, and what's the big deal, the big secret about the village? Nothing. I was ripped off. Even if I'd never seen the marketing, this movie sets itself up as a thriller, and then it deflates itself. It felt like a lame prank being played on the audience, and it leaves me bitter to think about it.

The final twist is just weak. Big deal. It's not that unpredictable. And at the end of the movie, what is the point? In the end, it's unsatisfying as a thriller, as a romantic drama, and as a ""twist"" movie. So the whole movie is just supposed to be these political metaphores? That's it? Well, if I'm supposed to look at the village and then turn a critical eye towards my assumed Bush induced paranoias, it didn't even work. Because I liked the village! If anything, this movie actually made me wish I lived in a place like that. I sympathised with Ivy's father. Plus, the political messages are a bit obvious, simple and trite.

I am glad to have seen this movie for its good points, but I still feel cheated. Did everything have to be mundane!? Not fun! This is not a good way to progress the story.

""The Sixth Sense"" was great.  It was interesting and original and filled with wonderful surprises.  I have seen all of M. Night Shyamalan's films, and only ""The Sixth Sense"" is worth seeing.  His films seem to be getting worse and worse.  Please Mr. Shyamalan, get away from Hollywood, do not listen to what executives at the studios tell you, and write something worth seeing again.

Are all scripts that arrive in Hollywood judged solely on their marketability and possible DVD market sales?  If so, we're in for more crap, I guess.  Can't they do better than the big screen version of ""Gimme A Break"" and ""Charles In Charge?""  Is Hollywood that desperate for material?  Or maybe all the agents who submit scripts for production are idiots who wouldn't know a good story if they read one.

Well, I'll be the first to say that film is a dying art.  I have four teenagers in the house, and they've seen two movies this year (the new Batman, and the new Star Wars).  There is simply no interest in anything else that's out there.  Your audience is getting restless, Hollywood.

Do not waste your time or money on this movie!

Not only is it his best film but I will go so far as to say it may join the ranks of my favorite movies of all time. The acting was perfect, real, touching. The sincerity and realness of each of the characters made me feel for them personally.

  The writing and dialog was beautiful and moving. The simplicity of the characters made the power of their essence all the more profound. The atmosphere and cinematography created the perfect mood in each scene. And the direction was genius. There was never one moment where I was disappointed or felt the director had sold out or given in to a Hollywood device.

  And this film kept me on the edge of my seat. It really did scare me and make me jump out of my chair a couple of times!

  The final resolution of the film I felt was perfect, inspiring and I was touched to tears. I give this film my highest marks for acting, cinematography, music (which was just right and never in the way of the movie nor did the movie rely on it) story and direction.

2167266,5,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamaln has made some quite unusual movies in his time, and he continues in that tradition with ""The Village"". It should be made clear that a lot of the mixed reception this movie has received has been due to misunderstanding it or having different expectations of it. This is not a horror movie. Nor is it mainly about the creatures.

The story follows a group of villagers who live in a valley basically isolated from ""the towns"" by a forest. In this forest live some creatures who the villagers always refer to in indirect ways. Between the villagers and the creatures there is a truce of sorts: the villagers do not enter the forest and the creatures do not enter the village.

Events come to a head when Lucius Hunt volunteers to enter the woods to get medicine from the towns. This was precipitated by the death of a young boy. Hunt himself is stabbed, and needs the medicine himself, so his new fiance agrees to make the journey. The catch: she is blind.

Unlike some reviewers, I didn't have the foresight to guess Shyamalan's twist for this movie, but I was very pleased to be caught out completely.

I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and in some places it still made me jump in fright. However, if you are expecting a movie about the creatures and the terrors they visit upon the village, you will be disapointed. The movie's focus is on much wider issues and deeper ideas. In this discussion of deeper issues the movie does exceptionally well. It presents possibilities with skill and flair. I can't say much more without risking giving some hints about the story's twist.

Finally, I found that this movie grew on me. As I thought about the questions and issues it raises, I found myself liking the movie more and more. If you just think the movie is ok for the first viewing, you might like to leave it and watch it again. You will probably like it a whole lot more. For a unique story, ""The Village"" is hard to walk past.",1122336000,8,1943,4.5085227272727275

Once you find out what's really going on and there is no mystery anymore (which is about 40 minutes into the movie)  all you want to do is hope that the movie ends, but it doesn't.  It just gets worse and worse and you start questioning yourself why didn't you listen to your friends, the ones you should trust, and you continue to torment yourself because you won't turn it off and tell them how right they were.  But they are right, and the movie finally ends and you want to hang yourself for watching a dumb ending to a terrible movie that you should of listened to your friends and never even rented it.

2167280,3,B00064LJVO,"I was aware of the extremely diverse reaction to this movie....some people loved it, and many (including most professional critics) despised it....but I purposely avoided any prior knowledge of the plot twists or surprise ending, so that I could render an objective opinion.

Predictably, it was a mixture of excellence and mediocrity: The splendid cast portrays characters that are generally devoid of any personality or enthusiasm...they deliver their lines (especially Wm. Hurt) in an extremely slow, halting cadence that becomes tiresome. Their conversation sounds like Amish people speaking under the influence of seconal, and if I lived there, I would spend all my time completing their sentences.

Other than the children, there is virtually no joy in the village...largely due, no doubt, to the red-cloaked ""monsters"" that menace the villagers from the woods that surround them. I felt that the monsters and their menace were very well presented. I was totally ""creeped out"" when one of them visited the village late at night and almost got its claws (twigs ?) on the blind girl, Ivy, the ""star"" of the movie, very well played by Ron Howard's daughter.

All of this tension and suspense began to unwind (for me), however, when Ivy is sent to ""The Towns"" (apparently external civilization) for medicine for her injured boyfriend. I swear that I recall this plot from an old Twilight Zone about 40 years ago. Perhaps that memory, or just common sense, led me to figure out the ""surprise"" ending well before it happened.

The transparancy of this final plot twist is probably the movie's greatest flaw. See it for yourself...and you decide...there are definitely portions that are worth the time and effort, and I must say that is quite original in atmosphere and staging, if not plot.",1122076800,4,1790,5.078231292517007

The problem with this film is the fact that it is hard to take it seriously. They need a cure for this guy, so they send a blind girl to get it. An old lady tells the guy that he is an idiot for sending his blind daughter into the forest, yet he tries to tell the old lady the her bravery outweighs her blindness. And while the blind girl traverses the forest, she doesn't hit any trees. For some reason she is able to navigate the forest perfectly, even to the point of remembering where things were. It is said that when you lose a sense, your other senses become stronger. Still, it is too unbelievable, which ruins the creepy atmosphere.

2167288,4,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan's star has fallen of late, and he has plunged from the Hollywood heavens like Lucifer himself. Once venerated as a brainy horror wunderkind fresh from his ""Sixth Sense"" triumph, Shyamalan is now reviled as a ""hack"" director, the consequence of disappointing his audience with ""Signs"" and now ""The Village"".

Both movies, through masterful trailers, promised their audience something big---and committed the brutally unforgivable sin of not delivering.

Is ""The Village"" a bad movie? Not at all.

Is ""The Village"" a grip-your-partner-in-sheer-Unholy-Terror kind of flick? Not at all.

Shyamalan is an interesting director: interesting in that he takes mainstream cinematic tropes and turns them on their head, puts them under an electron microscope, boring into their guts. He did it in ""Sixth Sense"" with ghosts, again in ""Unbreakable"" with superheroes, again in ""Signs"" with alien invasion, and does so once more with ""The Village"", which chronicles our fear of death and the unknown.

And this time, perhaps, Shyamalan struck a little too close to home: in our rapidly darkening age of gated high-security enclaves, hundreds of pass-codes for everything from voice mail to credit card accounts, identity theft, and the looming spectre of another terrorist horror, the question is---what are we willing to surrender for happiness, security, and safety?

So---with Shyamalan's ""The Village"", we are introduced to the denizens of the eponymous settlement circa 1896. The village alderman, mayor, hetman, whatever Edward Walker (played by a slow-phlegm-talking but note-perfect William Hurt) is burying one of the dead. Cut from the funeral to a communal feast, where hooting and bellowing sounds from the encircling Covington Woods, which elicits approving laughter from the Village Idiot Noah Percy (done to the T by Adrien Brody).

There is a truce, between the humans of Covington Village and the surrounding woods. Do not display the color Red, for the things which inhabit the thickets around the township hate it. Do not venture into their woods. And---I dunno, I forget---I think if you hear the alarm sound, hide beneath your covers, for They are coming. Whatever ""They"" are. Brrrr.

And so, for years this isolated little hamlet has lived in an uneasy truce with the unseen but deeply feared creatures in the forest. All is well, until, as always happens in fairy tales, somebody breaks the Rules.

I think people want to be deliciously, creepily spooked; certainly that's what ""The Village"" promised, at least on the surface. But that's not really what ""The Village"" is about: think more a kind of extended ""Anne of Green Gables"" Halloween special.

Now: in the final analysis, people hated ""The Village"" because the trailers for the flick painted it as the ultimate horror film: a movie about pure fear sauntering out of the woods, pressing its Night Gaunt face up against the windowpane, and peering in at you while you sleep.

Frankly, that's not what ""The Village"" is about. I'm not going to go into what it's really about, other than to suggest you keep an open mind: the gorgeous cinematography, the initial lurking fear, and the amazing acting (particularly Bryce Dallas Howard, simultaneously blind and the sexiest thing I have seen on this planet in her role as the luscious Ivy Walker) merit it.

Yes it's contrived. Yes it fails the ""truth in advertising"" smell test. Yes it's brilliant and scary and moving and more than a little sad. See it.

They even could of made it the year 3000, the point is the time period did not matter since all the elders knew it was a facade in the first place and the children would of had no idea since they grew up in that village and had no idea what modern was or the year it actually was. Get my point? Also, the monster idea was dumb, I mean wouldn't of someone in the village have tried to kill one of those beasts, someone who did not know what they really were?

I agree with a lot of other reviewers that the movie only takes off when the character of Ivy comes on-screen. Bryce Dallas Howard did an incredible job with this role.

The story is that the village is isolated on one side of the Covington Woods. No one breaches the perimeter and goes into the woods because of creatures that live there. Joaquin Phoenix plays a young man who questions the malevolence of the creatures and tests his theory by entering the woods, if only briefly. The next night the creatures come into the village and leave a warning. Eventually someone in the village needs serious medical attention and in order for him to live, someone must cross the woods to another town to get medicine. This is where the secrets of the town begin to be revealed.

I thought M. Night Shyamalan did a great job of giving you creepy glimpses of a rather unique creature, before finally revealing it completely.

It has received much undeserved critisiscm, IMO, but I am very grateful I remained steadfast in my skepticism about it because I really enjoyed it more than I expected to. I think the problem here is that too many people were misled as to what kind of film it was going to be based alone on the chilling preview seen in theaters, resulting in a lot of preconceived notions. They were thus disappointed. I, however, personally found the plot rather interesting and the movie as a whole to be original and unpredictable with unforeseen twists. I especially appreciated how the trepidition was brought about through atmosphere and sound rather than things jumping out at you, and it was a gutsy move to have the main character (played by the wonderful Bryce Dallas Howard) be blind, which gave the character far more depth... Andrien Brody also did an amazing job at his portrayal of a grown man (Noah Percy) with a child-like disorder, and Joaquin Phoenix as the brave Lucius Hunt who dared to cross into the forbidden woods, as well as being the silent love interest of the innocent young Ivy... The all-star cast was well chosen (I really felt kinship amongst the people, which made it all the more convincing), and the score by James Newton Howard was simple yet haunting--accenting the scenes without overpowering them...

Movies like this scare me far worse than blood-thrashing horror flicks, but that is just my opinion so do yourself a favor by giving this the shadow of a doubt and forming your own opinion before listening to everyone elses (to each their own).",1117929600,,1721,4.794612794612795

Night's most recent film, unless you had temporarily been living on the moon, (and even then, you still might've heard about it.) I waited so long to review this movie, because I figured that in time it would come into its own with audiences, and I think that time has definitely come today. In a world where pallid remakes of ""House Of Wax,"" ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Amityville Horror"" can be considered box-office hits, the artistry and originality of THE VILLAGE now seems more worthy of appreciation than it did upon its initial release.

Without giving away any of the fabled ""twists,"" this much I can tell you: a small village of Amish-or-Quaker-like inhabitants dwells on the edge of the Pennsylvania woods sometime in the 1800's. The town elders, William Hurt, Brendan Gleeson and Sigourney Weaver amongst them, maintain a sense of benevolent authority over all...save in one respect. A 'truce' of sorts has long been maintained between The Villagers and an unknown, unseen number of entities, ""Those Of Whom We Do Not Speak,"" who dwell deep in the surrounding woods. The conflict between the two groups that inspired the truce is never fully explained, but the rules binding it definitely are. The Villagers have sworn never to violate the sanctity of the woods where the creatures live, and in return, they have pledged to stay clear of The Village.

The silent but stalwart Lucius Hunt, (Joaquin Phoenix), bravely volunteers to breach the woods in search of vital medicines, when one of the children dies of an illness that needn't have been fatal. Lucius has never held much truck in the truce anyway, and now he has a reason to discover exactly what it is that lies beyond the wooded boundaries. The remainder of the movie encompasses as much about what happens when the 'truce' is eventually broken, as it does some startling revelations about the restless secrets being concealed within the confines of The Village itself, and its fearful inhabitants. Most of this part of the story could be gleaned from the long-form version of the sensational yet deceptive trailers that attracted moviegoers to this film in droves.

And since that is as much as I dare say about the movie itself, let's turn to those trailers for a moment. Even if ""Night"" had done a remake of Tim Burton's MARS ATTACKS!, he has unfortunately been cursed by the strength of THE SIXTH SENSE, with a reputation for being the guy who comes up with the nifty twists and the ""shocker"" endings for all of his films. Which is very similar to the quandary that Orson Welles must've found himself in when he exploded into the cinematic firmament with his masterpiece, CITIZEN KANE. How does a filmmaker top something that remarkable?

Yet, though the quality of the finished product has been debatable for a few years now, the way the trailers handicapped the movie certainly isn't. Film buffs expecting the kind of wallop packed by SENSE were already doomed to disappointment, and were extremely vocal about their displeasure, since the previews seemed to promise a neo-Gothic thriller that held as many surprises as that previous effort. Sci-fi/fantasy/horror fans went expecting a goosebumpy, gratuitously gory ride from the same trailers, and with the exception of one horrifying scene that is all the more powerful BECAUSE of its restraint, they also walked away grumbling about how much it 'sucked.'

So, here we are a few years after its provocative theatrical run. If you've heard about it but never seen it, and you know nothing about it, what does it have to offer you now that would make it worth two hours of your precious time?

First of all, it is still a timely post-9/11 allegory about how when you balance a ""culture of life"" with one of fear, falling off of that precarious balance between the two comes at a terrible price, no matter how well-intentioned the reasons are for it. (Which is the last thing I'll say about the plot. The rest you can figure out for yourself.)

There are many great actors and some beautifully modulated performances here from all involved. There have been complaints that not enough character development or backstory was allowed with the bulk of the characters, but as the majority of the film really belongs to only three of them, the reasoning behind this is now completely understandable.

Besides Joaquin Phoenix's top-drawer rendering of the decent-and-not-quite-dutiful Lucius, the acting world got a stunning introduction to a remarkable new talent. Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of prolific filmmaker Ron, made her unforgettable debut here as Ivy, daughter of Hurt's town elder, and nearly unrequited love interest of Lucius. She commands every scene she's in with graceful restraint and natural charisma, and she deserves every accolade she received for this performance. (Not a surprise that Lars Von Trier tapped her for his next film, MANDERLAY.)

As equally powerful and unfortunately underpraised, is Adrian Brody. At first blush, it would seem puzzling that he would accept such a small role in a large ensemble cast, considering the spectacular and much deserved kudos (and the Oscar) he received for THE PIANIST. But seeing what he does with his role as the slow, sweet-natured best-pal-from-childhood of Lucius and Ivy, you will come to realize why his Oscar win was no fluke.

The bulk of the movie actually belongs to these three fine actors, and THAT'S as much as I can say about their part in it.

Without stretching this review out into novel length, in closing, I want to defend THE VILLAGE with one last comment...If you saw it when it first came out and decided you didn't like it one bit, give it another try now. You may STILL think it's subpar, especially from a filmmaker with Shymalan's rep, but give it another shot. I can't promise you that you will absolutely love it now, but you may make some surprising discoveries you didn't before, and might even come to like it just a little bit.

To the few film buffs who bought into the negative hype and didn't see it at all, give it a shot. You may find your fears about it validated, or you might kick yourself in the butt for not taking the leap sooner.

Oh, and for those not into story development or subtlety, you may want to steer clear. (And yes, this means YOU, fans of SEED OF CHUCKY, HOUSE OF THE DEAD or RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE.)",1117238400,2,6439,4.864051094890511

THE VILLAGE is flawed, but better than it gets credit for. People were probably disappointed because the film was sold as a thriller when it's a mood piece about how fear and paranoia impact a community, a timely theme in our post 9/11 world. Instead of misrepresenting THE VILLAGE as a twisty shocker a la THE SIXTH SENSE, the marketing department should've tried another approach: ""M. Night Shyamalan as you've never seen him before!"" :-)

Unlike MNS's previous films, it's easier to see through this story about the citizens of Covington Woods, an 1890s-style farm community, who won't venture beyond their village's borders because of their uneasy ""truce"" with the ""creatures"" outside, including jettisoning anything colored red, the ""bad color"" that purportedly attracts these creatures. The narrative transparency causes the dreamlike effect of MNS's usual leisurely pace to peter out too soon. Fortunately, the stellar cast, beautiful Pennsylvania scenery, and eerie atmosphere held my attention. Former co-stars William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver reunite as village elders Edward Walker and Alice Hunt; for once Hurt's slightly dazed soft-spokenness suits his character! :-) Joaquin Phoenix, re-teaming with his SIGNS director, radiates quiet strength and intensity as Lucius Hunt, who tries to cross the village borders into ""the towns"" for medicine to combat the community's recent rash of illnesses and deaths. Phoenix is well-matched by Bryce Dallas Howard, lovely and endearing in her film debut as Walker's blind daughter Ivy. I liked Ivy's subtle boldness as she saves the day after the guys who accompany her to the village borders chicken out.

I wasn't surprised that our household fave Adrien Brody signed on for the role of mentally-challenged Noah Percy (or as his character has been dubbed by smart-alecks, ""the VILLAGE idiot"") as his first post-Oscar role. It gave him an opportunity to work with a hot director (turning MNS down at that point in his career would've been akin to turning down Alfred Hitchcock in the 1940s and '50s), and most actors can't resist playing handicapped characters. Brody did a fine job with a role more complex than it first seems. In Brody's able hands, overgrown child Noah simultaneously breaks your heart, makes you laugh, and creeps you out. His behavior reminded me of autistic/ADHD children I've known, so I was particularly moved when Lucius wonders if ""the towns"" might have medicines to help Noah ""sit still and learn."" (Seeing Brody in 1890s-style clothing also got me thinking how great he'd be as Ichabod Crane if somebody films ...SLEEPY HOLLOW again!) The finest moment in Brody's performance comes after Lucius and Ivy's engagement is announced. Up until this point, Lucius, Ivy, and Noah have been a trio, with Noah responding affectionately to Ivy's kindness. That changes forever after the engagement, when Noah turns up on Lucius' doorstep with grief in his heart, tears in his eyes -- and a knife in his hand. After the attack, Noah's parents find him rocking agitatedly on the porch, frightened of ""the bad color"" on his bloodstained hands. When Ivy finds out, she confronts Noah, who holds his arms out to her, clearly sorry and hoping for forgiveness, only to have Ivy start shrieking and hitting him until she's dragged off him. Although what Noah did was horribly, unforgivably wrong, his howls of anguish and wrenching sobs almost brought me to tears.

When Lucius' wounds become infected, Ivy must trek to ""the towns"" to get medicine. Here's where the twist (and the *SPOILER*) comes in: Walker gives his daughter what turns out to be a prescription, and the foreshadowing (particularly various Villagers' revelations of losing loved ones violently in ""the towns"" in their pre-Village lives) pays off. Our villagers *don't* live in the 1890s. The time is now...the village is a sanctuary from today's world, created by the town elders to raise their children away from the tragedy and heartbreak of their former modern city lives... the creatures were fabricated to keep the young people in line and in the dark, with various townspeople -- including Noah in mischievous-child mode -- donning creature costumes and skinning small animals periodically to scare everybody. And Walker masterminded it all! A history teacher from a powerful family, Walker used his inherited wealth to establish this quasi-Brigadoon in an isolated area of the Walker family's game preserve, with the adults conspiring to keep the village going with various deceptions. I liked the idea that Walker's rich enough to pull this off, with the preserve personnel on board with the ruse (when the young ranger Ivy meets outside the game preserve realizes she's a Walker, he quickly agrees to help her); I'm all for the idea of living in one's own little homemade world! :-) But why the hell would supposedly intelligent modern people like Walker & Company set their new community in an ersatz 1890s (even the gravestones list 1890s dates!), a time without *antibiotics?!* The film begins at the funeral of a little boy who, it's made clear, is one of several children who died of illnesses that could've been cured with the right medicine. I can't believe Walker and the town doctor didn't take precautions to have modern meds available just in case, to say nothing of medicine/treatments that might have helped poor mentally-stunted Noah and maybe even Ivy's blindness before it was too late. It's unconscionable that, however well-meant Walker's power trip is, he and the others would let their children die or be damaged for life rather than go into ""the towns"" for help, even if it means their elaborate ruse might collapse around them! (Amish people come to cities for supplies or trade in real life, so why couldn't Walker and the villagers do the same?) THE VILLAGE would've been more compelling had the script delved deeper into that aspect of it, with the secrets, lies, and power the elders have, but at such a terrible cost. Then MNS might have had a future classic on his hands, not just the cinematic equivalent of a nice try.

When THE VILLAGE was released on DVD, I rented it to double-check whether I'd missed anything that would have made sense out of the village elders' eschewing modern medicine other than simply not wanting to return to the big, bad city and risk painful memories and/or giving themselves away -- and no, there wasn't.  Indeed, now that I've seen the DVD and its extras (including interesting making-of featurettes and Bryce Dallas Howard's personal production diary), I'm more convinced than ever that The Big Twist was a last-minute decision by M. Night Shyamalan to add a surprise plot turn to THE VILLAGE to meet fans' expectations (is the twist still a surprise if viewers actually *expect* one? :-).  There were a couple of striking scenes left out of the finished film, but one didn't make sense in context and the other was redundant (too bad, because both were beautifully filmed and acted), so I can see why they ended up on the cutting room floor. Still, the film is worth watching at least once if you approach it as an ensemble drama about a paranoid community instead of as an edge-of-your-seat thriller.",1116633600,7,7238,5.0459866220735785

Their descriptions of the ""terror"" and those who cause it are likewise something one would expect to have found in the 1600s, not in modern day.  The clothing also, as well as the way of life of these people is anachronistic, just plain ridiculous.

The elders let you know that they have suffered losses in their own lives and in their families in the modern world, so why this pretension of speech and manner.  The story itself is so silly as to be juvenile.  If there is any message at all, such as you can not escape evil, the movie could have been a half hour long and got that across just as well.  But the definition of evil is confused because its perpetrator is not a completely functioning human being, so if there is a message it is not a clear one.  The scary music and dark scenes make for a backdrop of terror, but that terror is false and meaningless.  It seems to me that all the movie had was this setting of a mood, and that was it.

I suppose if I had taken the movie at face value I might have felt the same way. I'm sure for the other people who disliked it, that's what it boiled down to. This movie was never meant to be taken at face value though. Just like Signs wasn't so much about aliens and more about faith. This movie isn't so much about what's outside the borders of the Village, but about love. More specifically the beautiful, absurd and sometimes ugly things we do for the people we love.

The personal tragic stories of a group of people have been exaggerated to impose a general religious-like beliefs, which resembles the witness in church phenomena.

But this is a review of The Village. Excellent movie.

I have to lay claim to guessing what was coming, however. I didn't know exactly how it was going to play out, but I decided early on that the biggest thing I was taking for granted was that this film took place in colonial times. So I figured I was probably wrong. Thankfully, M. Night did not disappoint. I really liked how this aspect of the film played out.

The cameo by Shyamalan was also well done, although it was easy to see if you were looking for it. If you didn't notice, he was the guy behind the desk in the office.

The making of features on this DVD were absolutely fantastic, far above and beyond what is put on the majority of DVDs these days. Excluding the price gouging special editions, of course.

As always, Shyamalan included one of his films he made as a child. This time, it was a take-off on Indiana Jones, which was funny and amazing at the same time. Shyamalan had a lot of talent from a young age. Good stuff to look back on now.

The problem with most thrillers is that once you've watched them one time, there is nothing left. Too many of these films spend all of their creative energy trying to give the audience a scare. The best directors of the genre create truly great films, which just happened to give the audience a scare. While M. Night Shyamalan is an excellent craftsman, he tends to be unable to elevate his films into the realms of true cinema. The Village is no exception.

The story centers around a small village that seems to be set in the later part of the 1800's. The Villagers have worked out a complicated deal with strange creatures (""Those We Do Not Speak Of"") lurking in the near woods. Problems arise and the long held pact begins to break down. This causes there to be a need for one of the villagers to venture through the woods into the larger towns.

The biggest problem with the Village and the last several of Shyamalan's films is his surprise endings. I read somewhere several years ago that he didn't want to be pigeonholed into doing the same supernatural type stories with twist ending. I wish he had kept to his word. Instead everyone goes into the theatre expecting, waiting on the surprise at the end. This is a distraction taken away from the whole of the film; it is a gimmick that has run thin. A truly surprising ending for the director now, would be no surprise at all.

Where Shyamalan excels is his Hitchcockian use of suspense. He understands that some of the best thrills come not from something jumping straight out at the audience, but in what we don't see. It is a long time in the Village before we see ""The Things We Don't Speak Of"" and even then we only catch a glimpse. For Shyamalan understands that our imaginations are more powerful than any piece of costuming or CG effect. There were, in fact, several moments during my first viewing of the film that hand my hair standing on end. These were tense, beautifully paced moments.

The film also creates a masterful sense of mood. The color scheme, set design and costuming are all top notch. They give the film a true sense of paranoia and suspense. The acting, for the most part, is quite good. Which is not surprising considering the cast is made up of the likes of William Hurt, Sigorney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, and Adrian Brody amongst others. There several interweaving human stories set amongst the supernatural tale, some of which are quite moving. Yet it is the supernatural aspect that shines brightest, and ultimately, falls flat upon subsequent viewings. Watching the film a second time, knowing the surprises, I felt a tinge of boredom. The story no longer captivated me as it did the first time. Knowing the truth, there were too many plot points, and character actions that seemed false, or self serving.

It is a film worth a first viewing. Shyalaman is a true talent, and I look forward to his next film. In a sense the Village is really two stories. One is a suspenseful tale of creatures lurking in the dark, and the other of a quaint village dealing with extraordinary circumstances. I believe the fault lies with the merging of the two. The suspense doesn't hold up under subsequent viewings. It does not serve the other aspect of its story. Likewise, the more human story is broken apart too much by the mystical aspects

Without spoiling it for those who haven't seen the movie I'll just say his movies (and this movie in particular) need to be seen like a feature length episode of the classic Twilight Zone TV series.  It might not be classified as horror.  It might or might not be sci-fi.  And it might or might not be a work of fantasy.  Like Rod Serling's classic series M. Night Shyamalan's films go beyond easy classification.

Perhaps The Village and his other films may or may not compare favorably to Rod Serling's most memorable Twilight Zone episodes but I certainly appreciate the creative effort in bringing this kind of modern ""fairy tales"" for adults.  This movie is about a group people who have chosen to seperate themselves from the corrupting influences of mainstream society.

Many people do not presently appreciate the brilliance of the film, but I believe, in time, more and more will come to realize what a masterpiece it really is. The film was made for an intelligent, thinking audience, but it was inappropriately marketed for grim and gore seekers. The unfortunate result was that many of the thinkers avoided seeing it because they are not usually interested in gore, and the horror fiends hated it because there wasn't any.

All the previews lead you to believe it will be something frightening and scary but it turns into a very sweet and moving love story. And after it was over, my husband and I talked about it and analyzed it. I think a sequel would be great!",1113782400,4,590,3.908333333333333

Cinematography/direction/film editing is beyond words, as well as the quality of the DVD transfer.  The score by James Newton Howard - and the performance thereof - is some of the most amazingly beautiful music you will ever hear - it fit the picture like a glove, and was integral in making this one of the most fulfulling movies I have seen in quite some time.",1113177600,3,679,4.495934959349594
2167358,3,B00064LJVO,"Without divulging any spoilers (for those who are deciding whether to rent/buy it), the basic story is a village peopled with folk with 19th century mores who find themselves plagued with strange monsters who live in the forest nearby. When the monsters attack, they leave behind mutilated animals and odd symbols. When a tragedy causes one of the central characters to linger near death, Ivy (who is blind) decides to risk traveling through the forest to ""the towns"" that lay beyond to try and get medicine.

As usual, there is a ""big twist"" ending but this time, unlike in his other movies, I was able to figure it out beforehand though I had to wait for Shyamalan to tell me WHY the village was as it is. I think the people hammering on the dialogue are being a bit harsh...it's not Shakespearean but it's nothing that will land it on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" either.

I'll agree with others that the film bombed in part because it was BADLY mis-marketed. It was advertised as though it were at the very least some sort of ""Blair Witch"" film, but it's more suspense than horror/slasher. If you're expecting blood, gore or ""stalking"" scenes, that's really not what this is..it's more of a ""moody"" atmosphere piece.

BOTTOM LINE:
This will NOT ""wow"" you like ""Sixth Sense"" did. You'll probably figure it out. But figuring out HOW the twist happens is tricky and still delivers some interest. If Shyamalan expects to continue the ""big twist"" formula though, he's going to have to do better next time.

A real film maker could have taken this story so much further - The ""evolution"" of the creatures would have been a thousand times more interesting.  How did the village get built?  Why?  That would have made a really great film - instead, M. Night Shyamalan waste a super cast (how does he get these really good actors and actresses to act so poorly?)on a rip off of the Twilight Zone and the novel ""The Giver"".

2167360,5,B00064LJVO,"Let me first say that I never felt this was a period piece as it was intended to feel.  It felt more like contemporary in an Amish-like setting.  But even though that aspect did not seep in, I still found the story to be brilliant.

We start with a funeral for a young child.  After the funeral we start to see the Amish-like community and almost immediately become aware of things in the surrounding woods.  The village is surrounded by a forest and there is a border.  On the other side there are those that are not spoken of; dangerous and intelligent creatures that keep the village isolated.

But things start to happen as small animals are found mutilated.  As the elders try to maintain calm, more events occur and it seems like the creatures are no longer peaceful.  One young man is convinced that they should send someone to the town to retrieve medicines that could help prevent deaths like the one at the start of the film.  Eventually a villager does need to travel through the woods to the towns for medicine.  This is not a decision that is made lightly.

As the story continues to unfold we get revelation after revelation until the whole brilliant tableau is revealed like a jigsaw puzzle.

This is a hard film to promote.  Unlike The Sixth Sense where the whole film could be described up to the surprise, this one can't be described without giving away some of the film's secrets.  Finding out those secrets is part of the wonder of this film.  The cast is made almost entirely of Oscar and Tony winners and nominees.  One of the strongest casts I have ever seen.  While other films by the director can be summed up simply (a boy sees dead people, a man believes in super heroes, aliens arrive), there is no simple phrase to describe this one and that probably is what hurt it in the theaters with viewers hoping for a creepy monster movie and getting something completely surprising.",1112745600,3,1903,4.547058823529412

After reading all the negative reviews when this film was released I decided to wait for cable, but was tempted after reading all the reviews for this film on Amazon. The surprise ending is not the same as the Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, it actually takes down the movie some considerable notches and adds nothing to it. What this film maker was thinking when he did this is beyond me. I will not give away the ending, but I will tell the truth that this is not or horror movie or a true monster movie. This is a human drama dealing with what appears to be an Hamish village, or one from another time. During the course of the story, the village idiot stabs the son of highest elder and they send a blind girl out into the woods to some nearby towns to get some medicine for him. Every single ad for this film suggests woods filled with bizarre creatures attacking people, this is purposefully dressed up as something that it is not.

2167364,4,B00064LJVO,"Last time I promised to write a short review, and didn't.  This time I will.

'The Village' was surrounded by an air of negative press since long before it was actually released.  Why or how this was I'm not entirely certain, but it was definitely there, and it eventually got the weakest reviews of the four major release M. Night Shyamalan movies.  Now, I can understand why people wouldn't like this as much as his previous 3 films, I probably like it the least of the 4, but why anyone who liked the others would dislike this one is beyond me.  It's the exact same formula. And yeah, the film was definitely mis-marketed, making it seem like a lot more of a horror movie than it actually was.  And yeah, the ending ain't so hot.  As others have said, it's neither shocking nor satisfying, but there's a helluva lot of movie before the ending.  It's beautifully shot, with gorgeous natural scenery, and some relatively original, intriguing looking creatures.  What's more, the characters are genuinely likable, particularly the leads Phoenix and Howard, something relatively rare and difficult in a period piece. Yeah, the movies slow, but so were all his others, and this fact is really beside the point.  Shyamalan's movies were always as much about the visuals and atmosphere as they were about the plot- the less eventful scenes are as much what the movie is about as anything.  And I suppose that's what it all comes down to.  If you were never much into the atmosphere of Shyamalan's work, you're probably not gonna like this.  If you were into it, check it out.

Finally, I'm gonna discuss the supposedly derivative nature of the finale.  This isn't really relevant to how much I enjoy the film, but I wanna discuss it, and it will have spoilers:  Lotsa people have claimed that the ending is stolen from this or that or whatever.  Maybe it is, but the sorta insistence that some people display is ridiculous.  The ending just isn't original or clever enough for you to need to insist that it was specifically lifted from anywhere.  Hell, look at the Amish.  All you have to  think is, 'Hmm, what if those people who live so different from the rest of us simply pretended like, or didn't know that we existed.'  It's nothing groundbreaking.  Hell, the ending occurred to me about 10 minutes into the film.  The thing is, this thought wasn't even based on anything I saw in the film, and I even missed pretty much all the clues shown thereafter.  It's just a natural, fairly obvious twist.  Naturallly, this is a flaw, as well, but it's a long way from plagiarism.",1112400000,2,2573,4.6496674057649665
2167365,2,B00064LJVO,"I don't know what happened here, but every frame of this movie screams vanity project. Shyamalan can create great popcorn movies, but this over-solemn, over-symbolic, and seemingly over-long (although it only lasts two hours) piece is a groaner all the way.

The story revolves around an unknown village, time undetermined. The villagers go through their daily motions, and it mostly seems like a particularly boring village, except for a few evil monsters living in the woods, who occasionally show up to scare the villagers, then leave. There's a boundary that the villagers can't cross, otherwise they'll be at the mercy of these horrid things. The main characters of this quasi-epic are Joaquin Phoenix as an energetic young man with small-town restlessness, Bryce Dallas Howard as his enamorata, the blind Ivy, and William Hurt as the village's ever-concerned uber-meister. A medical emergency develops in the village, which necessitates that someone leave the village for help, and it is Ivy who must go through the woods to find help.

Those who might be expecting a scare-fest might be disappointed. The promised scares here never materialize: what we get instead are things jumping at the screen, a technique which requires no real artistry or craft. In fact, almost all of Shyamalan's movies have used similar tactics, and a scare that has to use a knee-jerk reaction doesn't really count. It's like cursing in front of an audience of sixth-graders: they'll laugh, but not because you're witty--more because it's out of context and they're uncomfortable and trying to lessen the tension.

The story, though, is even worse: the twist is something you'll think about 10 minutes into the movie, then discard by saying, ""That's too stupid."" Then you'll find it to be true. It is my pick for the stupidest movie twist of all time, in my opinion it is far worse than the ""it was all a dream"" ending. I would call it a deus ex machina, but it's not: a deus ex machina is an ending that comes about because a writer wrote himself (or herself) into a corner and can't end the story. This movie was structured around its ""twist"" from the beginning, which is akin to attempting to build a skyscraper on a local swamp. The characters, with one exception, are as flat as a pancake. The exception is the newcomer, Bryce Howard, who almost saves the movie. Almost, but not quite. The absolute worst part, though, is the all-too-obvious symbolism about American isolationism. I'm not saying that the director is wrong, necessarily, it's just that it's put forth with no subtlety, in a way that makes you cringe because of the oversimplicity of it all. I equate it to House of Sand and Fog and John Q., the latter of which it resembles way too much in its mix of too-serious--even pompous--melodrama, overt manipulation, and predictable storyline. Although this movie isn't worse than John Q. (I happen to believe that movie to be the worst movie made in the last decade at least), a comparison to it is not a plus.

The redeeming values in the movie, though, are Ms. Howard's astonishing breakthrough performance, which almost redeems the non-scares, non-power, and non-drama; and one scene that takes place on a porch, which has Phoenix and Howard talking about life, love, and much else, which makes the movie's curious dialog almost beautiful, and almost turns the movie into something else altogether. My advice to the Shyamster: leave the protesting to other people and give us some more enjoyable pulp, but don't go pretentious. Look at what happened to Woody Allen. Stick to what you do, and you'll be fine, but don't try more unless you know what you're doing.",1112313600,4,3662,4.911147011308562
2167376,4,B00064LJVO,"As a politically-aware movie-goer, I seemed to have walked away with alot more from this film than most of the reviewers on this site. First of all, I found ""The Village"" to be more imaginative than far-fetched, and it opened my mind to a different perspective (mainly the religious right view that stresses a more conservative, old-fashioned, values-based society) on a number of issues; from gun control to censorship to fear-mongering to the affect that education, religion, and upbringing can have on a child from day one (the very reason that ""The Village"" is able to exist in the modern world). In terms of the movie's lead character, Ivey Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard), I haven't seen such convincing purity on film in a long time. Her romance with Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) perfectly captures the film's essence of a simpler, more innocent time (i.e. the complete absense of homosexuality, murder, violence, and alcoholism), and her encounter with a wildlife officer from the civilised world reveals a girl who is mature yet vulnerable, beautiful yet antiquated, mannerly yet naive. Certainly, the beginning of the film is both awkward and slow, and the characters come across as more mad than convincing. However, ""The Village"" is designed to keep its audience in a climatic suspense until the plot is disclosed in the last ten minutes of the film, and only after watching it in its entirety can one begin to comprehend all of the themes ""The Village"" covers. I highly recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind who is looking for a suspensful film with subtle social messages.",1112227200,,1595,4.977528089887641

I can see how people may say that it is boring, however the themes in the movie are amazing and they could get me into deep discussions.  Truthfully, the way I see it is that the smarter you are, the more you will enjoy this movie.  You will only enjoy this movie if you can look deep into every detail and take what is meant to be taken from it.  If you are looking for a simple movie with no meaning and nothing but what is on the surface, than this is not your movie.  For a movie than makes you question society as we know it and the supernatural, with an ironic twist, The Village is perfect.  But don't expect to understand or even enjoy it if you are not educated to take meaning out of such films.  I must say that the only fault, if this can be considered a fault at all is that this movie was not made for the general public.  It was made for those few bright minds who would understand it.

2167383,2,B00064LJVO,"Perhaps I'm being too harsh on M. Night Shyamalan. I loved his first big hit, ""The Sixth Sense"", a movie that did everything right: great cast, great story line, outstanding production values and a director's viewpoint that didn't sneer at his audience. You beheld a unique filmmaker who put his brilliant imprint on everything in this production. ""The Village"" turns out to be nothing more than an expanded ""TWilight Zone"" episode. Except ""Twilight Zone"" didn't cheat its viewers. In ""The Village,"" there are no chills, no suspense and you're left with an overhyped drama where everyone talks in whispers and they act real scared everytime they look at the woods. This is supposed to be a parable but when several of my friends watched this DVD with me, most had picked up a magazine to read halfway through. Nothing in this flick connected with us. There were nonstop close-ups of excrutiating length. You kept muttering, ""Okay, we've got the close-up---now move it!"" Here's a revolutionary suggestion: Shyamalan needs to study the early work of Tobe Hooper, Brian DePalma and George Romero to see raw, unvarnished film-making that proves exhilirating to the viewer because these filmmakers poured their passion into their work. They sweated blood in the horror genre to create brilliant, fresh looks at worn-out formulaes and made them alive. Shyamalan is becoming increasingly like a smug movie producer/director who believes his own press and has forgotten about his audience. Let's only pray he doesn't get his hands on the rumored remakes of ""The Thing"" and ""Creature from the Black Lagoon.""",1111622400,4,1598,5.126436781609195
2167394,5,B00064LJVO,"I really hate people sometimes.  They grab onto a single concept and never let go.  People saw the Sixth Sense, and the ""twist"" ending and they immediatly associated with M. Night, expecting him to do it movie after movie, after movie.

Of course, along the way, those movie goers forgot to watch the film, but instead, kept trying to watch for the twist.  It's silly to me, that people keep expecting twists from his movies, as though that was the sole purpose of his directing.  They failed to see what his movies really are.

The same thing happend with Unbreakable, which in my opinion, is probably the best super hero origin movie ever made, because it's so realistically done, you can't feel but believe that this man has special powers.  It wasn't your typical super hero driven movie like xmen, where the powers take over the film. But no, people had to judge it because the ending wasn't twisty enough for them.  Sigh, I still remember comments by people saying that the ending was a weak twist ending, as though M Nigh had ever said he was going for a twist ending.

It's the same with this movie.  People kept hoping for the twist ending, and when they didn't get it, they completely lampooned this movie and called it bad.  I mean, can you really call it a twist ending, when you are pretty much told almost 30 minutes before the movie ends that these folks live in the present time? I saw that part of the story coming miles away (especially with the mention of the box they didn't want anyone to open- I either figure it had a gun or some kind of electronic).

The movie itself is a what if situation. A study on how it is truly impossible to control all the bad things that happen in the world.  Evil actions will still be committed by people, now matter how much you try, because in the end, it is our own human nature that causes those actions.  We feel love, hate/anger, greed, sadness/depression.  Violent crimes are often committed because one of those emotions.

The choice of colors for the movie also shows its point.  By making red the 'forbidden' color, the elders were trying to instill in the younger folks that killing or hurting someone else was bad.  Blood is red, so by hurting someone, you are bringing out the 'forbidden' color.  While yellow, if I remember correctly, psychologically, has a soothing effect on human psyche.  Yellow is attributed as a color that calms down people (I think I read of a study where they painted a room yellow and found that the person in the study was less inclined to get angry.)

Of course, people get fixated on things.  They saw the ads, and they wanted to be scared. They wanted monsters and thrillers. What they got was a movie that required you to think, and of course, people hate it if they don't get what they wanted.

It's a movie about wanting innocence.  How people react to innocence and the fact that today's society has lost it.  We are a society that believes themselves to be right in everything. Ask anyone about their political belief, and they will never once concede that they might not be right.

The ending wasn't a twist ending, instead to me, it was rather endearing. For one thing, what I saw was that this park Ranger, an over-informed 21st century person, reacted to Ivy's innocence, her pleas and felt compelled to protect that innocence.  It's interesting to see that he was young himself, not yet too old so as to be absolutely cynical.  Why do we try to protect our children, or any child? Because we want to protect innocence. An innocence we know we lost a long time ago.",1111536000,5,3571,4.528861154446178
2167395,4,B00064LJVO,"And that premise isn't about scarry creatures.  This is in my opinion Shyamalan's least suspenseful movie.  So if you're looking for horror, explosions, monsters or other sophmoric entertainment values in movies, you might be dissapointed.

On the other hand, without revealing too much, the premise of this movie is what is fascinating:  The concept of 21st century Americans living in a 19th century village with its' corresponding values and lifestyle is what really intrigued me.  The offspring of the village elders who are growing up in the village are not aware that there is an entirely different and modern 21st century world outside that has passed them by.  The ""monsters"" that roam the forrest surronding the village are what keep the villagers from leaving; fear of the unknown.  But in reality, the fear of the elders aren't the monsters but modern society, which is revealed much later in the film.  Obviously, unforseen situations occur which result in one of the elder's children (Bryce Howard in a strong and moving debut performance) having to cross through the dark, terrifying forrest to get medicine for her love (played by Joaquin Phoenix), a son of another elder.  Ultimately, this is a romantic movie about the power of love and conviction, with a creepiness that is Shyamalan's trademark (are the ""creatures"" real or imagined?).  The initial first hour of the movie is so well executed in terms of period costumes, speech, and manerisms that you'd swear it was taking place in the 19th century.  That's what makes it so believable to the offspring of the elders.  They aren't exposed to the cynicism, corruption and moral decay of the 21st century.  The innocence and values of the villagers is so well contrasted against modern society that it gives the movie a sort of haunting innocence to it.

The cinematography is excellent and very well shot.  If you own a high end plasma, DLP, or LCD you'll love the way the picture looks.  And being a musician I really enjoyed the score, which was nominated for an Oscar.  It has a sort of Shaker simplicity to it, with Aaron Copeland influences.  The great classical violinist Hillary Hahn's (all of 24 years old just like Bryce Howard!) playing is so pure, loving and moving and is used to musically define Howard's character very effectively.",1111449600,2,2315,4.937984496124031

2167397,4,B00064LJVO,"No one is making movies quite like Shyamalan. No one. His is a unique offering and his audience is becoming intensely loyal. It is a pleasure, in many respects, to see a director seek his own vision in his own way without any interference whatsoever. Art is not a thing made by a committee--despite what popular education today would have us feel. Shyamalan's movie-making (for as much as his politics would probably disagree) hearkens to Ayn Rand's Howard Roark in The Fountainhead: a man who will not be deterred from his vision and will accept no compromise. He is one who will not and can not stand to work with peers. There may be a movement in this... perhaps not of a particular style of movie-making (though Hollywood would do well to imitate some of his!) but rather a certain bravery in production that will allow some of the most innovative and imaginative story-tellers to weave their stories in uninterrupted fashion. That, we feel, would be Shyamalan's greatest contribution to the genre. There is no question that he is forcing critics and audiences to take the subject of speculative fiction seriously.

WHO SHOULD WATCH THIS:

Adherents of Shyamalan did not wait for our review to watch this movie. They have seen it. Probably more than once. And they have purchased it and shelved it next to Unbreakable and Signs. Perhaps they are here looking for the reasons why they love his films so much; we say it is for their purity. We believe that Shyamalan's productions are worthwhile for anyone to watch except for those super-action purists who must have explosions and battle; cursing and stoicism; bravado and irreverence. Shyamalan's perfect foil as a director is probably Quentin Tarantino--both are gifted visually and tell compelling tales but the reason they film and the things they explore couldn't possibly be more different. Where Tarantino seeks the edges of the human psyche and subverts them in reductio absurdeum attacks, Shyamalan infiltrates the psyche and strips away the odious barnacles of reality leaving a kind of Platonic ideal to his visions and his people. There is little likelihood that those who purchased Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill are just now investigating Shyamalan but they should probably avoid. If we were to rank Shyamalan's current corpus: we would say that The Village is as good as Unbreakable, which are both not quite as good as Sixth Sense (though more important thematically) but both better than Signs.

WHO SHOULD AVOID:

As we mentioned, come not here for combat, action, nor sex. The love here is a chaste love. Yet also, don't come to this movie expecting a ghost story because you won't find one. This isn't a movie about external fears of the supernatural but the internal fears that we carry with us. If you're looking for a good ol' fashioned slasher flick than go elsewhere for none of that is resident in the village. Blood is spilled--visibly--but artistically. For flayed flesh, murdered innocents, and mayhem, you'd be better served by the cerebral yet ultra-violent The Cube.

2167398,1,B00064LJVO,"Okay, without giving away too much of the ""twist"" ending (and if you do not figure it out within the first half hour of the movie you may want to consider having a CAT scan), let me just ask this question:  if the Elders of the Village are all in on the ""secret"", why didn't one of THEM go and get the medicine?

In a nutshell, if anyone but M Night Shamalama-ding-dong had brought this pathetic script to a studio, he or she would have been laughed at.  This is Grade Z material coated with a thin veneer of Grade A production values.  Someone stop this man before he writes again, he clearly has no ideas left.",1111363200,11,612,4.205128205128205
2167399,1,B00064LJVO,"Scariest movie of the year? ""Laughing"" Goodness gracious. I rented the village, expecting something good out of who they call MASTER OF SUSPENSE M.NIGHT SHAMALAN. But this movie was ridicuous!! It wasn't scary?! It's as if while writing this story, he smoked somethig and finished it in a hurry. The creatures were made up?? Come on How is that suspense. It made no sense. It lost my interest. I couldn't wait for it to be over. I was bored out of my skull. And this is the same guy who wrote sixth sense, and signs. Both were good films. This movie the village was horrible. I couldn't believe they called this the best thriller of the year? More like the best borer of the decade. I wasted my money. I guess they think we're all idiots who are easily entertained by one stupid twist....a very lame twist, that completely lost tthe whole purpose of what people were expecting out of the movie. The monsters! They were fake?? oh wow what a great idea? Is that absurd or what. Sixth sense was genius.. maybe it was written with help from others. Tis movie was slow and it dragged on. And i was very disgusted that they killed the animals just to scare the village. What next human sacrifices. That's immoral. The whole idea of messing with their own families heads was just haneous. Adrian Brody did a horrible job acting as a mentally disabled boy. Joaquin was too good for this film. I haven't even rented any movies since this. I'm too afraid of wasting my money on another terribly boring and sucky dvd. Face it. Only old movies are the best ones. These people are running out of ideas and becoming deperate. Why do you think they keep turning to the past. 80's and 70's films.are some of the best movies of all times. Movies aren't what they used to be sadly.",1111276800,4,1763,4.478260869565218

2167402,4,B00064LJVO,"Just as ""The Sixth Sense"" wasn't ultimately about ghosts, and ""Unbreakable"" wasn't ultimately about superpowers, and ""Signs"" wasn't ultimately about aliens, ""The Village"" ultimately isn't about the monsters that may or may not threaten the characters in M. Night Shyalaman's latest effort, and I think this is part of the problem some people had with the film.  Much like Rod Serling did with the ""Twilight Zone"", Shyalaman uses devices like ghosts, aliens, or monsters to try to make a larger point.  And much like Serling, Shyalaman can get some mixed results.  For every classic episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" there were several episodes that, while entertaining, were rather silly and forgettable.  Similarly, ""The Village"" may not be quite as satisfying as Shyalaman's previous efforts. I think Shyalaman may go a bit far in trying for a sort of double twist ending, and again, I think this threw some viewers off.  ""The Village"" does have some scary moments, though, and I give Shyamalan credit for his originality, and for trusting the audience to think a little while they are being entertained.  I'd also point out that Shyamalan succeeds in making the audience want the monsters in the film to be real, even when their nature, is called into question.  The final twist in the film is as unexpected (in my opinion, anyway) as any that Shyamalan has created.  ""The Village"" may be more flawed than M. Night Shyalaman's previous efforts, but I must point out again that Shyalaman is at least trying something different, and the result is an entertaining if flawed film.

  As a post-script, I've read some reviews elsewhere that tried to portray this film as somehow political.  I didn't see this at all, and I'd go so far to say, with all due respect, that those who read any political message into this film may need to try harder to let go of their political agendas long enough to enjoy a movie.  At any rate, if you're worried about politics intruding into an evening of movie-watching, don't worry about it in the case of this film!",1111190400,5,2045,4.841954022988506
2167403,3,B00064LJVO,"I had put off watching this movie because I had heard so many people I know talk about how bad it was.  One of my friends had bought the DVD and liked it.  I borrowed it from him and he told me I would probably get really bored with it but to not give up on it and it would all pay off in the end.  After about and hour and fifteen minutes I had had almost all I could take but stuck it out just because of what my friend told me.  Sure enough it paid off with a great twist almost as good as the sixth sense.  I thought I had figured out the twist before but I was quite surprised when I found out the real twist.  I won't give anything away but like my friend said give it a chance. I won't lie, the first hour is excruciatingly slow but the payoff comes.",1110931200,3,757,3.789808917197452
2167414,5,B00064LJVO,"""The Village"" is an amazing movie. In terms of atmosphere, pacing, score, and cinematography, it is possibly M. Night Shyamalan's masterpiece. Only ""The Sixth Sense"" equals the experience he creates here.

While smarmy internet spoil-sports and jaded, cynical critics found much to fault in the film, anyone who goes into it with an open mind will be dazzled. Don't look for the plot twists (though they are present), don't expect the big surprise (though you may be surprised), just let down your defenses and be drawn in.

Despite my love for (and familiarity with) Shyamalan's other films, I was still amazed by ""The Village"". The cast including William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, and Joaquin Phoenix is excellent. Adrien Brody and especially Bryce Dallas Howard give top-caliber performances.

Shyamalan creates a moody, atmospheric setting as he explores the life of a town seemingly encircled by dark woods which hide a horrible secret. The people of the titular village live in fear of strange creatures lurking just out of sight. They constantly worry that their fragile truce with the monstrous beings will be broken. But things are not what they seem in Covington Woods - or are they?

M. Night Shyamalan and Touchstone Pictures spared no expense when it came to the DVD packaging of ""The Village"". The extras are superb, and there are many goodies waiting to be uncovered.

After the brilliant ""Sixth Sense"", the flawed-but-interesting ""Unbreakable"", the excellent ""Signs"", and another masterstroke in ""The Village"", the only question many movie fans have left is...what will Shyamalan do next?",1110844800,2,1602,5.217898832684825
2167415,3,B00064LJVO,"I'm a big fan of M. Night's, but admit to being a little disappointed by his latest effort.

The movie details a circa 1880s village whose occupants are terrified of the creatures (referred to as ""those we do not speak about"") who live in the forest that surrounds the village.  Some of the villagers maintain a tense nightly vigil from their watch tower, while the others cower indoors in the hope that nothing happens.

When one of the characters, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is injured, circumstances dictate that someone from the village try to traverse the forest in an attempt to get needed medicine from neighboring villages.

While there are a few scary moments in the movie, particulary any of the scenes taking place in/near the forest, I found the movie wanting in creating a feeling of tension.  The village itself is a well-constructed movie setting, and the period costumes and dialogue are very well done--although some of the conversations seem a bit rambling at times.

The actors do a good job and William Hurt, as the village's patriarch, is well-chosen for the role.  I did have a problem with Phoenix being given such a prominent billing considering that he spent nearly half the movie unconscious.

The movie's revalation, while a twist to a few, became obvious to me a little over halfway through.  While it may have been a bit clever, it had the feel of a Twilight Zone ending (the movie could easily be condensed into a one-hour Zone episode).

Overall, it's a decent flick with some scares to it.

Oh, by the way, I noticed Shaymalan couldn't help but put himself in his own movie (again).  We didn't get to see his face this time, but I know his voice.",1110844800,2,1678,4.689419795221843
2167416,3,B00064LJVO,"I think the problem is the director bills this as another scare movie with a twist like Sixth Sense or Unbreakable.  With every movie he has made, the twist has gotten less and less until finally we come to the Village.  I think if you are not expecting a twist and are there to watch a movie, this could be okay.  I didn't feel like I wasted my time watching it. But when the ""twist"" of sorts is revealed half-way through, I kept waiting for the twist.  I thought at the end I would be surprised, I couldn't wait to find out what the twist was, then the movie was over. As a movie, it was okay.  Good acting, decent plot.  As a THRILLER, it was crap.",1110758400,2,651,4.086614173228346

yes, this is a slow moving movie. no, the creatures in the woods aren't in every scene, so don't expect them to be. they are more of a sub plot, in the way of the real story taking place. they are more of obsticles in the way of the salvation of the characters.
with that being said, this was a good movie. not shyamalan's best, nor does it surpass his previous three movies, but this is still a very good movie. the ending had my brother and other people angry as hell and, personally, i liked it. i thought it was interesting the way it spawned out to be what it was.
all in all, the village isn't a memorable movie besides the ending which you will either like or hate. you will not love it, you will not kind of like it or be unsure, you will come to a complete decision as the credits roll. i liked it, and i recommend you to watch this movie with an open mind.",1110672000,2,1067,4.014084507042254
2167418,4,B00064LJVO,"A lot of people say this movie was slow and the story line was weak. Most thought the end wasn't as shattering as other movies by Shyamalan. When I saw the trailer of this movie , I thought to myself now thats one movie I wouldn't like to watch.

Twenty minutes into the movie I'm trying to figure out the who's who and the what's what. There are some great scenes in the film that made me want to capture it for a while. I was quite moved by the scene on the porche. Now that was an excellent scene. I felt to myself ""Hell wait a minute...isnt this supposed to be a Horror Flick?"" There's some great emotion that wilfully shows on screen. The elders in the movie and how they were portrayed was as per quite ""unworldly"" owing to the fact it requires complete abandonment of the normal social norms that exist.

I felt I was lost somewhere in the middle of the movie. I mean the total  plot seemed kind of confusing to me. The haunting violins that add to the super stunning visuals only left me more guessing than I thought I would be. Noah's (Adrien Brody) character was very interesting and befitting.

I won't ruin the end for the fortunate people who haven't seen the movie. Fortunate because they have a great movie to look forward to. Once the movie ended , I couldn't help but carry a 10 minute grin on my face. It managed to have that affect on me.

Now I know this movie is not for anyone. Its not your regular scare you to death movie. However its different with its limited yet quite enrapturing.

And while I did more or less figure out what was going on, I was still glued to my seat and scared silly. M. Night knows how to build tension and keep it going for sustained periods.

2167422,1,B00064LJVO,"A friend and I rented the DVD. My friend - based on viewing the trailers alone - wrote what he thought the ending of The Village would be as the opening credits rolled. Maybe 30 minutes into the film, terribly bored, we were chatting and I offered my guess how it would end, almost as a joke. He showed me his slip of paper with his written guess. They agreed. And so did M. N. Shyamalan apparently because we were right.

That about sums up The Village. It's the most predictable movie I've seen in years. With predictability comes a complete loss of tension. All that's left is the acting, subplots, and scenery. None of which are worth the cost of a rental, really.

We're introduced to an isolated village reminiscent of a Mennonites or some other religious sect. Shymalan has done a credible job putting together the culture with two irritating habits: their dialog is stilted to sound like a bad mockery of Shakespeare and their endless deadpan expressions staring off into space drain all life from their performances. Janquin Phoenix's talents are totally wasted. His wooden performance is absolutely painful to watch. The young women of the village are mysteriously enamored of him despite the fact he stares off into the distance brooding as they express their love.

Shyamalan skips the subtlety that made Sixth Sense such a surprise ending. He telegraphs from the beginning that some mystery resides in the woods forcing the viewer to figure out the puzzle. The village has an uneasy peace with those whose name they won't speak. They are not to venture into the woods. But the elders and most of the villagers appear content in their isolation. Figured the ending out yet? I won't give away any other clues because two or three more of the not so subtle hints Shyamalan gives you and you've figured it out. For those too slow to take the hint, with a lot of time remaining, he reveals the truth yet the last third of the movie relies on creating tension that a principal character - to whom the secret was revealed as it was to the audience - is still befuddled and afraid by those whom we don't speak of.

Oh, what an awful mess. It really deserves 1 1/2 stars, not 1, because it wasn't so bad I couldn't make my way through it but, overall, it was so dull I was glad when it was over so I can't manage 2.

Although we still aren't thrilled that the film quality looks cheap, we understand the look they were trying to accomplish. It has been years since an ending surprised me in this way. Not scary but in a way that has you talking to friends and family about the unique story. Suffice it to say that most fans of movies like ""Signs"", ""The Sixth Sense"", and ""The Others"" will probably like it. The cast is key to making it work and do a wonderful job in their roles. I recommend this movie, and be sure you watch it at least twice before decidng what you think about it.

This movie starts with a kind of ""hunh?"" thought.. and ends with a ""unghh.. "" feel.

It starts out visually appealing with a range of familiar faces. Slowly it gains momentum before screeching to a halt and leaving one to wonder ""why?"" Why is the movie still going on? why am I no longer interested in what happens? Why are the best characters so under developed?

The Village is one of the most boring movies I've seen in recent years.  The pace is so slow and annoying that it makes ""The Sixth Sense"" look like an action movie.

In the case of the Village, we have a beautifully recreated 19th century town, a flawless cast, and a genuinely creepy concept to work with.  It seems that with all that, adding the 'Shyamalan Twist' would be unnecessary; and it was!  Shyamalan is a truly gifted filmmaker and has created some amazing and frightening film moments, however, applying the same formula for the fourth time seems to reveal a level of insecurtiy or fear, that an artist of his calibre should have outgrown by now.  For those who have seen the film, imagine what this film would have been if the monsters were real!  It would have forced Shyamalan to NOT add the twist at the end, because there would have been no reason to! But it seems that he wanted the suprise ending there at all costs, and in this case, it cost him the chance to finally break the mold and mature as an artist.  In his previous films, the twist was essential to the story, it made everything make sense.  In the Village, the story is essential to the twist, it just feels forced.  All and all there are some really creepy moments and some really good performances; but these seem somewhat wasted on a film that could have been so much more than a rehash of the same old formula.

Long story short: there was no point to the twist ending other than the twist ending.

In Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense, the twist at the end of the movie was essential to leading the main character to the next stage of his life (or afterlife). In Unbreakable, the twist ending resulted in a revelation for both the main characters and further established Willis' character as a hero in the minds of the audience. In Signs, the twist ending completely changes the way Mel Gibson's character views the world/universe and our place in it ... allowing him to reclaim his lost faith. In all of these movies the twist ending was the foundation for the final scenes of the film ... creating a frame for Shyamalan to say ""this is the point of the movie.""

In The Village, the twist ending comes and it reveals ... nothing but the twist ending. Yes, the twist was cool and it makes you view the whole movie in a different way (just like in Shyamalan's previous films), but this time there was no clear point to the twist. None of the characters had a true life changing moment as a result of the twist in The Village. I mean, imagine if in The Matrix everyone discovered that the world is a computer-generated hoax and the reaction from the characters was ""So what?"" When a plot twist radically changes EVERYTHING in the lives of your characters you need to show the audience that this change MATTERS in the lives of your characters. Shyamalan gave us an AMAZING twist in The Village, and the characters in the film couldn't have cared less. You can argue ""that"" was the point (that no one in the village cared) ... but I don't think so.

If the characters in a movie don't care about what happens to them, then neither will the audience ... and that's why I suspect so many people felt let down by The Village.",1109548800,12,2071,4.4136125654450264

The hallmark of a film by Mr. Shyamalan is the slow yet deliberate pacing. He does a good job of telling a story about a society that is closely knit and forced to live within certain rules.

He does a good job presenting both sides of the closed society; how and why it was created.

I rate this very much worth owning, but warn would be purchasers  this film requires one to have patience and be willing to let the  story develop. Those who need instant gratification via explosions of blood and gore will be very disappointed.

The acting is excellent in this film, and, oddly enough, the actors blend well with the setting.

Finally, from a visual standpoint, there are shots in this film that are so beautifully framed, it moves the film from entertainment to visual art. In my mind, the visual art of filmaking has been pretty much ignored since Tim Burton made the Batman movies.

I commend M. Night Shyamalan for creating this visual masterpiece to go with his excellent script.",1109376000,5,1104,4.713541666666667
2167458,1,B00064LJVO,"There are good film-makers and there are authors who exploit the unknown to create horror.  Others use shock and senseless violence to help you escape your cares and earn their cash.  Then there's The Village...  This story is a seedy preacher in a goofy pig costume with porcupine quills.

The first half is story development, then suddenly the mystery is revealed:  the town elders parade around in pig costumes with porcupine quills, perpetuating fear in the townspeople so that they will not try to leave the town.  So much for narrative irony!

The founding elder, William Hurt, tells his blind daughter the secret and grants permission for her to leave the village in search of medicines that will save her mortally wounded fiance.

Will there at least be a double twist and a bloodbath?...

The village idiot -- who attacked the girl's fiance -- finds one of the intimidating pig-suits, but when he attacks her, the blind girl outmaneuvers him and he falls into a pit.

The blind girl finds the hidden road her father described.  It must not have been very well hidden.

She reaches our modern-day world then returns with the drugs, but not in time to save her lover.

The last twist in the plot is the revelation that the town founders created their village to escape the crimes and injustices of our world.  In their commune the people are kept safe living in terror.

William Hurt's name is the first sign of trouble:  His deadpan dialog, weird Shatneresque em-pha-sis and stilted actions are sure to please fans.

In the end, the Village is too shallow to be profound.  Read the news and save your money.

2167462,4,B00064LJVO,"If you're looking for a scary, monster movie or a horror movie with lots of action and blood, - this ain't it. It's 90% period-piece drama and 10% monster movie. In that sense it was mis-marketed.

Nevertheless, I liked the movie for what it was - a suspenseful period-piece drama with a symbolic message of sorts.

The story is about a 19th century puritan-style community living, isolated in a village. They live in a low-level but constant fear of the creatures who live in the surrounding woods.

The DVD comes with about an hours worth of extra features - 4 deleted scenes, the director explaining the making of the movie, interviews with the actors, etc. I wish there would have been a segment in which M. Night S. discussed the symbolic meaning in his tale, but alas - no such discussion is given.

** Attention: Spoilers - don't read further if you don't want to know the plot twist and the ending! **

What I liked most was that this story was a superb portrayal of how those in power use fear to control the masses. In the story, it turns out that the leaders of the village simply made up the monsters as a hoax to keep the people from daring to go through the woods. All so that the outside world wouldn't taint their idyllic lifestyle. The leaders began with good intentions, but ultimately the entire life of the town was built on a lie. In the end, one of their own residents turns ""evil"", as if to show that evil is not something that is outside of us but rather the capacity for evil follows us wherever we go.

The parallel, in our society of course, is how political and religious leaders similarly use fear (of terrorists, hell, etc.) to keep us in line - usually with good intentions and ""for our own good"", but often based on lies (Iraq WMDs, Iraq tied to 9/11, etc.).

If one were to look at this movie from a psychological standpoint you could say that the town, by isolating themselves, repressed their own capacity for evil and projected it outward onto the creatures (their own psychological creation of sorts). Ultimately, one of their own became the monster in their midst (their psychological chicken coming home to roost, so to speak). That this was the mentally challenged character strikes me as being because he, being ""simple"", did not possess the intellectual (or in symbolic terms, spiritual) deviousness to wear society's mask and embrace the group hyposcrisy - thus becoming the perfect scapegoat to bear his society's collective projection. If the leaders were to have acknowledged their complicity in his crime, admitted their ruse to the residents - and led them out of the woods at the end of the movie it would have made for a great Jungian metaphor (Repress stuff onto shadow, finally acknowledge and integrate shadow, move toward psychological wholeness, etc.). But strangely, at the end of the movie it appears that they are simply going to move forward, propping up their delusion and keeping the people in darkness. I'd like to know why M. Night chose this way to end the movie.

Overall, an interesting message about how fear is used to control people, the nature of evil, and how we humans will go to great extremes to not see the propensity for evil within ourselves and our own complicity in society's problems.",1109203200,,3264,4.664347826086956
2167463,4,B00064LJVO,"Jeff Shannon's (Amazon.com) take on ""The Village"" is half-and-half.
""[Shyamalan is] derailed this time by a howler of a ""surprise"" lifted almost directly from ""A Hundred Yards Over the Rim,"" an episode of The Twilight Zone starring Cliff Robertson that originally aired in 1961. Even if you're unfamiliar with that Rod Serling scenario, you'll have a good chance of guessing the surprise.""
When I learned that the time period for the movie was going to be 19th Century, I knew right away what the ""surprise ending"" was going to be.  To that extent, I agree with Mr. Shannon.  As far as the ending being lifted from the Twilight Zone episode, that is essentially nitpicking, as the structural resemblance is coincidental.  As to the cast being wasted, the roles themselves for the most part are a bit thin.  And there is the unfortunate casting of Bryce Dallas Howard with her unmistakable Valley Girl quality.  She tries very hard, but there is a whole generation or two of actresses who are so hopelessly infected with Valley that they will never recover.  Of course, listening to Night Shyamalan in the interviews on the DVD you realize that it would be impossible for him to detect and correct it in his actress' performance since he is so utterly Valley himself.

I didn't find it to be too bad but I must say that it's a somewhat slow movie and full of suspense. The village was situated in a small rural community cut out from the outside world. Nobody knows that there was also a small village located in a valley surrounded by Covington woods where strange creatures exist. The villagers moved there years before, disgusted with the urban lifestyle and wanted to lead a simple life. They had a pact with the creatures that they will not cross into the forest and the creatures will lead them live peacefully in the village. The turning point came in the movie when Lucius Hunt played by Joaquin Phoenix wanted to go in the woods when a small boy dies, but he couldn't succeed in his mission. Unfortunately he was stabbed by Noah played by Adrien Brody, because they both loved a women, Ivy who was blind, but she loved lucius, so much that for him she decided to cross the woods alone, to get the medicines from the town.

BIG PICTURE QUESTION NUMBER 1: Was this movie entertaining?

Yes and no. Mostly NO. It seemed to take itself too seriously, and while a few scenes were well acted and appropriate in length, other dragged on. It often seemed like the characters were speaking in slow motion. Similarly, characters (with the exception of the two sisters and the crazy/retarded wacko guy) came off as stoic and inhibited to the point of being silly.

BIG PICUTRE QUESTION NUMBER 2: What was the ""squirm in the seat"" factor, on a scale of 0 (enthralled) to 10 (thank God it's a DVD so that I can go reorganize my sock drawer and just keep it on for noise)?

8. Interesting story line/concept, but enough with the slo-mo talk and stare scenes and the stupid dialogue that is so often emotionless and vague, and takes itself ever so seriously.

But this 1st twist was a cliche and just kind of ruined the film for me. Now on 2nd viewing however I did like it, but I think it remains Shyamalans worst film. He had a great premise, he just messed up

a little bit. Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, William Hurt,

Sigourney Weaver, and Adrien Brody are all great, but it is Howard who gives the best performance in the film. After the death of a young child, Lucius Hunt (Phoenix) asks the village elders to let him venture into the woods, which are haunted by seemingly large porcupines, and go to the towns and retrieve medicines for other people who may be sick. The elders decline.

Then, we venture into Lucius's love life with Ivy (Howard) much to the dissapointment of the village idiot Noah (Brody). When a major event happens however, Ivy must venture into the woods alone. Now the ""creatures"" that lurk in the woods are very cool looking. The costume designer did quite well and as usual Shyamalan throws in his signature twists.

The Village is an isolated place, and almost timeless. It could be modern Amish or (almost) from Colonial times. They have no contact with ""the Towns,"" since they are cut off by a forest haunted by - well, it's not clear, at first. Gradually, we see an increasing complexity in the rituals, like avoiding the color red, that keep The Ones at bay. But they are not wholly at bay.

Then there is a terrible crime, a man is injured so badly that his life is in question. Medicine from ""the Towns"" could save him, and the blind woman who loves him undertakes the quest through the dreaded forest.

Given this start, it could have gone in any of a few dozen great directions. Instead, the writer/director picked the direction that was the most ""psychological,"", i.e. silliest or psych-illogical (no, I won't say what). There were a few loose ends along the way that were never tidied up, either - if these people are so all-fired isolated, where do they get the kerosene for the lanterns they use so conspicuously?

There were a few good performances here, but Sigourney Weaver was not allowed one of them. I guess I'm glad I saw this one, but I sure won't bother seeing it again.

2167475,4,B00064LJVO,"The Village is, if nothing else, M. Night's most visually stunning production to date. This movie got unfairly panned if you ask me. The story is engaging, the cinematography top notch, the acting very well done, it has the best score of any movie released this year, and it has what is--hands down--the best scene of the year.

So what if Mr. Shyamalan has a fixation on that ending twist? So what is this was the weakest twist yet? It's all about the journey people--not the pay off.

The most arresting quality of this movie is its beauty. The contrast between the environment in which the villagers live--the drab village (no red allowed) and the stunning vibrance of the surrounding fields and woods serves as swirling canvas for the story to then be painted on. The bold colors of the robes they wear almost palpably call for the younger generation to explore what lies beyond.

The score works hand-in-hand with the visuals, with the natural sounds of branches clacking in the breeze, to cast an eerie pall over the whole movie. An aside: the DVD title page has to be one of the best out there. I usually get to hear these things a few times through waiting for my ADD wife to get situated--this one is first rate.

Let's talk acting:

This cast, from top to bottom does an excellent job. Joaquin Phoenix (could he be M. Night's Jimmy Stewart?) hands in another great performance. Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt are both great in their understated ways.

And...

Good God, where did they find Bryce Dallas Howard? I haven't been blown away by an actress like this since I saw Kate Blanchett in Elizabeth. There are so many scenes that almost make this movie great--and all but one of them is because she is involved.

Speaking of those scenes: the stabbing and the conversation while sitting on the rocks come in close seconds, but the greatest scene of the movie, and of 2004 if you ask me, is the conversation between Lucius and Ivy on Ivy's porch. Joaquin Phoenix gets to speak words that will ring true to any man whose ever been in love. Meanwhile, their words literally hang in the air.

The Village is a strong movie. It is what it is. In a year that had very few great movies, I give this one a strong recommendation",1108684800,3,2234,4.551122194513716
2167476,4,B00064LJVO,"While I heard a lot of negative reviews about this movie, being a huge fan of every other M. Night movie, I of course HAD to go see ""The Village""!  And over-all the experience was good, not great, but good.

First let me tell you what the movie is about- a village filled with people who have decided to live in something similar to a commune- with basically no contact with the rest of the world. Suddenly their happy existence seems to be ruined by what appears to be some kind of creature that is killing animals, leaving the village people in fear for their safety. Featured in the cast are a group of coming-of-age teens among the towns ""elders"" who are more than a bit curious of the outside world and why the two lifestyles can't mix.

Was it a scary movie? Yes, at points. Did the ""twist"" at the ending shock me? Yes. Was I a little disappointed with the movie over-all? Yes. Was it worth the money? Yes. Do I still think M. Knight rocks? Yes!

Now, let me say that I think a lot of people are so disappointed with this movie is that the twist isn't as big as the one in the Sixth Sense. Or as scary as Signs. But here's a tid-bit for you, a writer is not going to write all of his scripts the same! I know it's shocking for some, but Knights movies don't always have to have a twist at the end! I think that because of the Sixth Sense, people just expect that from him and have pigeon-holed him. And obviously for each writer there will always be one masterpiece that stands out and some work that isn't as good as the rest. I think The Village is not his best work, but I didn't think Unbreakable was either. However, I still enjoyed both movies in their own right. As far as the twist goes, I am pretty good at guessing endings and I did NOT guess this one. My mouth was actually gaping open...but maybe that was just because I was so into the movie I wasn't waiting for a twist. And when you're waiting for a twist, that is usually what ruins it. It can never live up to what's inside your mind.

One thing that was a bit hidden in this movie was the THEME. I guess it might have been that you can't hide from evil- you must face it?  The theme in this movie is not as obvious to me as it has been in other movies. As far as the plot goes, I think it was quite original and creative. I can't think of another movie that it reminds me of. Also, there were several surprises through-out the movie, or developments that definitely kept me hanging on the edge of my seat to see what was going to happen. I think that and the bit of a love story added in made the movie much more redeemable. Plus, the movie had many top-notch actors/actresses.  I was quite impressed with a few ""new-comers"".

This movie is a drama like all of M night's movies. If you just enjoy his movies based on the creep factor like some garden variety horror flick YOU ARE MISSING THE POINT! Unbreakable had a Superhero element too it but it was really about a man finding purpose in his life. Sign's had aliens but its really about a father coming too term's with his wifes death and trying too become a father too his children. The fantastic elements are just a means too drive home the story. This story is a drama/love story. Although Ill admit the twist was a bit disappointing. But It was dissapointing because of expectation's of things going the other way then his other film's. We cant crucify him for doing something different. For all we know if everything was as it seemed in the story and it was suspenseful we might have been dissapointed he isn't trying too break new ground. He has all but killed the formula he was creating for his movie's and next time we won't know what too expect. So if you want too watch Drama/love story that tries something different watch this. If you don't like that kind of stuff and are looking for a scare rent a horror movie.

Also, the script contains a lot of great lines, where it is not just what is said, but the peculiar way that it is said, that gives us deeper insight into how the characters' see the nature of their lives.  This is definitely one of my favorite movies in recent years.",1108512000,2,685,4.448

2167484,1,B00064LJVO,"Gee, I felt cheated after watching this ""sheep in wolf's clothing"" movie ! The spooky trailer that I had viewed prior to the film's release, painted a picture of an eerie story mixing elements of ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""The Howling"" about a mid-nineteenth century community being terrorised by evil beasts lurking in the neighbouring woods. And based on M. Night Shyamalan's track record of scripting solid thrillers, who were we to suspect anything different ?

OK...if you haven't yet seen ""The Village"", then here's your chance to stop reading before I give away the entire plot of this movie !

Instead, current Hollywood whiz kid, M. Night Shyamalan feeds movie audiences an unbelievable story about a group of New Yorkers who have all suffered personal tragedies (partners murdered, business went broke etc), so they have headed off into an enormous walled forest reserve to create their own secluded Amish style community and to pretend they are living in the late 1890's ! And to keep anyone from leaving their little slice of man made Shangri-La, the village ""elders"" have concocted and maintained some superstitious gibberish about monsters lurking in the woods surrounding their small hamlet !

And movie audiences are meant to swallow that in the two or three decades that the group have been in this reserve, that no park ranger has ever come across them or seen their nightly ring of fires, and that no aircraft has ever flown over the reserve, and that no one from the community has challenged the superstition and has headed out through the woods to discover the modern world, or even that one of the young men in the village hasn't tried to KO one of the beasts ( the village elders dressed up as werewolves ) with a good lump of timber ???

Crikey....give audiences some credit for having better intelligence.

If I wanted to watch a film about a utopian community, then I would have watched Frank Capra's classic ""Lost Horizon"", and if I wanted to watch a thrilling horror fantasy picture, then I would have selected ""In the Company of Wolves"".......however, ""The Village"" is masquerading as both, and fails as both. Ultimately, it is simply a love story between Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix, clouded with a huge amount of false horror distractions, and an overlong running time.

The DVD release contains a handful of tepid extras about how Wiliam Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and their fellow actors learnt what it was like to live in nineteenth century New England, plus some other ""behind the scenes"" footage on churning butter and cutting down trees that is mind numbingly dull !

Suitable viewing for curiosity's sake only.",1108339200,4,2660,4.910913140311804
2167485,2,B00064LJVO,"THE VILLAGE, M. Night Shamalayan's fourth movie, is a disappointment.  Having enjoyed THE SIXTH SENSE immensely and finding UNBREAKABLE fairly so, I had expectations for this film, even though it received mostly negative critical response.  I can see why.  THE VILLAGE is atmospheric and Roger Deakins cinematography is sometimes breathtakingly beautiful, as is James Newton Howard's haunting and evocative score.  The problem is that Night has paced the movie so languidly, and gives away his surprise twist early in the movie, so that when it comes at the end, I smiled and said, I thought so.  It's hard to give away much of the plot in this film without spoiling it for viewers who haven't seen it yet, so I won't go there.  Bryce Dallas Howard owns the movie with her controlled, passionate performance as Ivy.  Joaquin Phoenix always seems to whisper, so his dialogue is at times very difficult to focus on.  William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver are competent but wasted in poorly developed roles.  Oscar winner Adrien Brody isn't very impressive either in his role as the obvious village idiot.  The movie doesn't succeed as a horror movie as there is little horror in it; as a suspense movie, it's too deliberately paced; and as a romance story, it only manages to briefly touch the spark between Howard and Phoenix.  I hope in the future Night recaptures some of his earlier finesse, or he may find himself directing made for t.v. movies in the future.",1108252800,5,1458,4.862348178137652
2167486,1,B00064LJVO,"I love Shyamalan. That's why I bought this movie.

Those of you talking about ""great performances"" - did you see the same movie I did?? Talk about forced dialogue. The only person in this movie who pulled off the part they played was Bryce Howard, who, by the way, should have been listed as the star of this movie considering the amount of time you spend with her.

And was it supposed to be suspenseful and scary? That's why I bought it. This movie is not scary - it doesn't make you jump, cover your eyes, or get a chill. Unless of course you're afraid of human-size pigs and the color red.

The impression I am left with of this movie is that the producers had 2 different movie ideas in mind, and decided to combine them into one. Unfortunately for them, it didn't work too well.

The bottom line is this, the marketing of this movie was totally off. It's not horror, it's not suspense. It's a drama. That's it. Just a regular run of the mill bizarre movie. If you're looking for The Sixth Sense or Signs here, you're just not going to get it.

But if you're looking for Shyamalan, then I equate this to people who loved Jim Carrey going to see The Majestic. This is just not the usual stuff, and not what you are expecting to see. Unfortunately, that can be disappointing enough. Unless you're Spielberg, being a good director just isn't enough sometimes.",1108166400,,1361,4.428

2167488,4,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan's got a knack for strange circumstances, haunting filming, and twist of plot and in The Village he uses these teqniques to rescue a relatively simple story from mediocrity.  The village, hidden from the world in the middle of a forest, could be many things at first glance, a religious commune or new settlement but of course all isn't as it seems.  The Village is a very fun movie to watch and the twists of plot, though given away early and pretty easy to figure out make the movie interesting throughout.  Yes the move is not scary, it is not supposed to be Shyamalan understands how to set up a film that seems to lead an audience one way as it really directs them in another way. If you watch this move looking for a scare... well Shyamalan's tricked you.

While this movie is a great watch it would have been better if the characters were built up a little more.  The whole aim of the first 20 minutes of the film are devoted to setting up the larger premise (good color bad color etc) and should have used that time better to develop the characters.  Possibly this was intentional in order to build suspense but I doubt it after seeing the directors other work.  Anonther detriment to the characterisation was the 19th grammar and language used in the script.  While it is understandable from watching the film why its overuse might seem phony, this false hood does something to seperate the viewers sympathy from the characters.

If you like M. Night Shyamalan you will like this movie and if you are a fan of suspense this movie will certainly please.  For the rest of us this movie does provide entertainment value and is shot beautifully.  Shyamalan has a great knack for giving his films a feel and he does this well... the feeling is unease.  Each scene has some element of unease in it.  I recommend this movie highly as one of the better thriller films of 2004 and the DVD version offers a few good extras including a ""making of"" that is worth watching.

I love his work. That's where I'm coming from.

I eagerly placed the DVD in my player, and my wife and I sat back to take it all in.

Within the first few minutes, in my head, I had an idea. A thought. A 'guess' at where Shyamalan was taking us.

 It happened to be right on the money, and I spent the rest of the movie saying to myself, 'Well...duh.'

It's superbly told and shot, with great performances all around, including the justly lauded Howard.  And it's not Shyamalan's fault that I happened to guess the plot of the film. After all, he ""got"" me multiple times before, and I'm sure he will again. I merely got lucky, to the detriment of my film-going experience.

My wife, a more demanding critic, really enjoyed this film.

I'm a city boy; she grew up in upstate NY. She knows ""the woods"", and thought this film got that ""spookiness"" of the unknown out there beyond the treeline down cold. She mentioned she was surprised at how much she liked this movie...and she HATED ""Unbreakable.""

2167494,2,B00064LJVO,"Note: If you don't want to know how the movie ends, don't read this. (I'm giving you fair warning now, so don't complain about spoilers later). The only reason I'm mentioning the ending and the ""big secret"" is because I'd like to spare you from the huge disappointment I experienced when watching this movie.

When I first walked into the theatre to see this, I couldn't have been more excited; after months of waiting, I'd finally get to see the movie whose preview had given me chills every time I saw it! The movie started out wonderfully: great acting, scenery that could go from gorgeous to terrifying in a matter of seconds, and, at times, almost unbearable suspense (that Shyamalan really knows how to scare!)The story takes place in a small town in the 1800's. At first this town seems like the perfect place to live: the people are friendly, the houses are cozy, and the scenery is beautiful. Despite the peaceful setting, however, we get the feeling that something sinister lies beneath the surface of this sweet little community, something that frightens the villagers and keeps them from  being completely at ease. Every now and then, they glance fearfully at the forest surrounding the village; nobody ever ventures into it, and a guard is stationed every night to watch over it.

Pretty soon, we find out why: according to the village elders, there are dangerous, hostile creatures lurking in the woods that will kill anyone who dares enter their domain. These creatures are supposedly unidentified monsters who are so bloodthirsty that the color red is forbidden in the village (it attracts them). For years, the villagers and the monsters have had an understanding: as long as the villagers stay out of the forest, the monsters will not harm them. At one point,however, one of the creatures enters the village at night, leaving the villagers to believe that their uneasy truce may soon come to an end and more of the creatures will attack. While all this is happening, we (the audience) still don't know what the creatures look like and half the suspense comes from wondering what they really are.

It was halfway through the movie when all my hopes for the story came crashing to an end: There are NO MONSTERS IN THE WOODS. When one of the villagers revealed a monster costume and said the shocking words ""It's all a farce"", I still couldn't believe what I was hearing; it was all I could do to keep myself from screaming right there in the theatre! After months of anticipating this film, of expecting a truly scary thriller, and of trying to guess what the monsters really are, THERE ARE NO MONSTERS! Disappointed doesn't even begin to describe it.

It got worse, though. The next big surprise was the reason the villagers created the story of the ""monsters"". The villagers aren't really living in the 1840's; they're living in a modern-day wildlife reserve. Supposedly, the leaders of the village used to live like normal modern people, but when tragedy struck their families, they decided the real world was too much for them and moved into a wildlife reserve to start a new (if extremely delusional) life. The story of the monsters in the forest was created to terrify their children and keep them from wandering too far and discovering the truth. They even had the village simpleton dress in a costume and wander around occasionally to scare the other children and make them believe the monsters were real! When the retarded boy died in the woods (still wearing the stupid costume), the leaders, rather than mourning him, remorselessly saw it as another opportunity to lie to their children by telling them he was killed by one of the creatures.

I basically went from sympathizing with the characters to being repulsed by them. What parents could lie to their children and deliberately terrify them like that? I don't think I've ever been this disappointed in a movie before; not only was it completely misleading, but the adult characters were selfish and utterly pathetic (I have no other words for people who are perfectly happy to live a lie and deliberately frighten and traumatize their children to continue living it).

Many fans of this movie have said that those of us who didn't like it ""don't get it"". I assure you, I did get it, and I didn't like it anyway. I'm no fan of slasher films and I didn't expect this to be one, but I also don't appreciate false advertising or almost totally unsympathetic characters. The two stars are for the cast and the filming. Better luck next time, guys.",1107820800,2,4524,4.7774936061381075
2167495,4,B00064LJVO,"Ninnies looking for another fright flick can re-rent ""Jeepers Creepers"" or try ""The Grudge"".  Those seeking more subtle inspirations will find it here.  Shyamalan's previous ""Signs"" surely raised goose bumps, but also interwove remarkable spiritual insights into a gripping, understated, plot.

""The Village"" continues the minimalist exploration, but throws the pantry doors wide open with a thematically dense script and dazzling array of performances.  The monsters of this film are not ""those of whom we do not speak"" who live in the woods, but the very real monsters lurking deep within our hearts and at large in human society.

The shear humanity of Shyamalan's achievement cannot be ignored.  William Hurt comes out of hibernation and gives his best performance in a decade.  The resolute courage and love shown by Joachin Phoenix in ""Signs"" is again reprised here.

Most of all, Bryce Howard steals the show with an amazing display of childlike vulnerability and inspiring determination.  Knowing that her sacrifice is utterly unnecessary - based as it is on a giant hoax - makes us love this innocent blind beauty all the more.

The set-up for all of the above requires a little patience and attention to detail.  Such minor efforts will be richly rewarded by the time the credits roll.",1107820800,3,1295,5.119047619047619

movie. It's a love story that had a lot of potential if

it were not so monotonous, two sided, and unilateral.

I happen to love movies i mean if they are Good there are

Good everyone has a different opinion. So it would

seem a Film is really only subverse and Relative when

anyone comes down to telling the truth about a film.

That is why i am telling you the truth.. Dont buy this

movie. I felt Saddened at watching this movie, not because

of any thing in the movie but because it really threw

me for a loop how sorry it was. The reason i was sad was

because i pictured all the poor people who were actually

going to buy this film or already had and were watching

what i was right then. Right then it occured to me i would

write a review to warn other people about this film.

Personally i didn't feel sad for myself i was perplexed

throughout the films entire beggining. Here's Why.

But first i would like to apologize to anyone who

watched it. I DID like and still do Signs and The Sixth Sense.

However i would like to apologize on behalf of such a

movie so richly colored in duo tone, quality yes but in Depth

as well.

1) It took 20 minutes into the film to get any sense of

rythym, before hand of which was wallpapered with

odd banter from the pages of the script. It was so

odd all i could do was laugh and honestly i was perplexed

because nothing they were saying made any sense that was

tangible. I felt myself for a lack of words in fact.

Perhaps that is the POWER of this film and M night shalamiman

Ya that's it. IT TAKES OUR VOICES AND MINDS.

2) Only later it became interesting or at least i thought

so, in actuality it turned out it was only relief from

being so bored where i was.

3) The camera angles were all very basic nothing besides

the basic textbook shot. It was so sad. I kept wishing

i was there to say ""Your Doing it all Wrong,

Try this or this for christ sakes.!""

4)The guy who wrote the movie........Put Himself in the Movie.

""Shivers"" NO STARS AT ALL. As a writer and dierector

it is his or her responsibility to amuse or capture us.. instead

i was just lost. It very ironic they had a blind girl finding her

way through the woods in this film. Kudos to Hellen Keller and walking sticks i GUESS........................... oh my god.

This movie wasn't Horror it was Horrible. It left me scared alright.. scared to pay another buck to see another one of

M night SHALAMALANYMINYMANMANS films.

Oh my god what a clincher. Dont say you weren't warned.

2167497,1,B00064LJVO,"When the commericals showed for this movie, I naturally assumed this film was about true creatures in the forest- but in all bluntness that was a load of lies. This movie is not a thriller, it was hardly a suspense film. Once again I'm fooled into believing that a film is a good film because of a few fast scenes they show on commericals. The Village I thought would be eeriee, at least exciting somewhat. But it is none of that. It's just a boring small town with small town problems, mainly the first hour is about boring relationships that I could have cared less about. The actors are dull and so is the entire plot when you finally get the jist of what is going on. There's a twist at the ending that is truly the only scene that made me open my eyes a bit, but then I sunk back into depression after a minute as the tale once more grew dull. This movie in my opinion is lousy. If you enjoy watching films though about ordinary people living ordinary lives (which I don't) you'll think it's all right. But for people who assumed this was going to be a fast- paced thriller about the supernatural in any way, forget it, there's nothing of the kind in this movie so don't even bother renting it out like I did.

Mainly, if you're still interested in watching this, it's about a small town surrounded by a forest and the tale the parents tell the kids is that there are unknown creatures in the forest lurking around. As long as the kids stay out of the forest, the creatures will not cross their borders and terrorize them. Yeah, it sounds interesting.

2167500,5,B00064LJVO,"Simply put, the promotional material for this film was some of the most innacurate and detrimental that I've ever seen. The Village is not a thriller. Granted, it has a few suspenseful moments, and you might even fight yourself on the edge of your seat once or twice. The core of this movie, however, is the incredibly powerful story of love that actually dominates most of the movie.

To summarise the plot without giving anything important away, an isolated village lives in a valley surrounded by a forest. In the woods live 'those we don't speak of', mysterious and dangerous creatures who wear red and are attracted by the sight of it. The villagers placate the creatures by staying in their valley and wearing yellow (the safe colour) when near the woods. The looming threat of disease, however, causes Lucious Hunt, a quiet villager who often seperates himself from the others, to request permission to pass through the woods and retrieve medicines from the towns beyond the forest. His relationship with the beautiful, blind Ivy Walker, and the great trial that faces both of them makes for an incredibly emotional and impacting story of love that surpasses all fear.

I can't get over the cinematography in this movie. It's simply beautiful to watch. I never really enjoyed any of M. Night's other films, but the camera work and use of colour in The Village leaves me stunned everytime. The acting is top-notch as well, specifically Bryce Dallas Howard, who gives such a convincing performance as a blind woman, that I would have thought she actually was. A very minimal musical score rounds out the package, which is perhaps the best thing Night could have done. A great deal of the The Village is totally without music, and the movie benefits from this greatly. In this way, the scenes where music is employed really stand out, and the compositions themselves are awesome.

I won't deny that there are a lot of bad reviews out for The Village, but I just don't understand why. There are no gaping plot holes, the movie couldn't be more aesthetically appealing, and I found the final few plot twists quite unexpected. I highly recommend this film.

I had to make coffee at 10:30 at night when I was watching it just to be able to make it to the ending. In hindsight, I know the time would have been better spent sleeping, but I kept hoping that the movie would get better and actually have at least a couple of unpredictable twists, so I stuck it out. Although the acting was passable, I found the movie itself absolutely impossible. It's slow, predictable, and incredibly boring. I might have liked it a bit better if it had been advertised as a drama rather than a horror flick, because at least I wouldn't have been expecting anything scary to happen. But, on second thought, that wouldn't have worked because drama would need to be at least somewhat believable, and it wasn't that either.

I don't know how Shyamalan is going to come back from this one. He seems to be regressing. Sixth Sense was brilliant, Unbreakable was worth watching, Signs couldn't be saved even by Mel Gibson but was at least tolerable, unlike The Village. I'm now glad my DVD club doesn't carry this movie because, if it did, I would have made the mistake of buying it before seeing it. I'd rather use the space in my DVD cabinets for movies that are actually worth watching at least twice. This one wasn't worth watching even once.",1107561600,4,1323,4.554621848739496

I know its a bold statement, but The Village backs it up. Now alot of people are giving this only 1 star b/c this film was erroneously advertised as thriller/horror movie. True, it does have the obligatory Shamalan build-ups where the tension has the viewer on the edge of their seat, but upon final viewing, it belongs in a category all its own. And the ending, what can I say about the ending. Watching this dvd, I was put into Old World America, a simpler time if you will, then it all came crashing down. Let's not forget about the debut of Ron Howard's daughter, her name escapes me, but her performance will not. Don't let these foolish people with their foolish reviews dissuade you, if your looking for an excellent movie to watch on a Saturday night, hell even a Tuesday afternoon, you won't find too many better than The Village.",1107475200,4,971,4.46067415730337
2167507,1,B00064LJVO,"This movie was such a raging disappointment that I hardly know where to begin trashing it.  I hated ""A.I."" and still maintain that was the worst film ever made, indeed, perhaps the worst ever considered, but ""The Village"" is a horribly close second.  The only really scary thing about this film is that it's been preserved on DVD when many classic movies still aren't available.  Maybe there's an extra on here called ""How I Lost My Ever-Lovin' Mind and Decided to Make The Village"" about Shyamalan's descent into madness.

Understand: I loved Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.  There were moments in ""Signs"" that I can't watch again because they scare the living daylights out of me.  However, ""The Village"" was tripe.  I won't go into spoilers here, because I don't want to devote that much of my life to this film.  However, the acting was really very solid.  How sad that Byrce Dallas Howard and Joaquim Phoenix would be wasted in this weirdness.  They were both quite good, as was William Hurt and the rest of the supporting cast.  Sadly, the ""plot"" is perhaps the worst ever conceived (so it may have an edge on ""A.I."" there . . .) and doesn't honor the actors who tried to do what they could with it.

The ""twist"" was completely self-evident about the time that the were-porcupines showed up.  I laughed out loud and nearly left the theater when the ""fearsome creatures of darkness"" arrived.  Were those things supposed to be scary?  Perhaps someone should ship Shyamalan a copy of Alien and let him watch that.  The funny thing is, in ""Signs"" you only got a couple of brief glances of the aliens, so it's clear that Shyamalan has seen ""Jaws"" and maybe the first ""Alien"" as well.  The problem is, with both of those flicks, the tension didn't evaporate and leave the audience snickering to themselves about the ""monsters"" needing a good grooming.

I guessed the twist ending as soon as I realized there were no planes flying overhead in the film.  I saw that, and thought, ""huh, I wonder where . . . oh, you have GOT to be kidding me.""  Sadly, once again, I was right, and Shyamalan was wrong.

Shyamalan's movies seem to get progressively worse, for some strange reason. I hope he's hit the bottom of the trough with this almost unwatchable turkey.",1107475200,6,435,4.8133333333333335
2167510,5,B00064LJVO,"I must say I was expecting more than I got during the movie. You will be fooled completely during this movie. Not because of the plot of the story, but what because the story is really about. The twist was not too original, and the ending is sort of given away near the middle, but it makes a lot of sense, and some people really do live this way. I'm not giving it away for anyone who's seen it but if you haven't yet, stop reading now.

The Village takes place in the seemingly normal township of Covington in the year of 1897. It's a seemingly normal place with a population of merely 60 people. As the simple life of these innocent persons continues, through the cracks of this perfect and blessed comes something no one ever expected to be there in the first place.

Strange, and evil creatures who infestate the woods around Covington have kept a truce with the townspeople for many years. The residents of Covington won't go into the woods, and the creatures won't go into the valley. But when Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) determined to show the village there is nothing to fear of these creatures, breaches the border of the woods. Now the race against time is on to stop to escape the village before all hell brakes loose.

This is exactly what M. Night Shyamalan sets you up for and it turns from a horror/thriller, to a romance filled with physical and mental obstacles. I'm sorry to say that even though I enjoyed the film deeply, it was not what we were put up to believe it was about. I came out of the theatre thinking to myself, ""My God, what was I thinking, I want my five months back"" but then I came to realize it does have it's moments, and in it's own way is very entertaining when you look at it one way instead of the other.

The acting, I must say, was not all it should've been. Even with nation wide actors such as William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brenden Gleeson, and Joaquin Phoenix, the village brings in people who are too used to be being in the modern times, and don't make it too believable that they are in fact in 1897. Joaquin Phoenix who is used to acting in action related movies completely flops over in this dramatic style for Shyamalan, and same goes for Sigourney Weaver. It seems like a good movie, but there's just something that makes it fall short of being so.

There are, in fact, two things that saved this movie entirely. One, first timer Bryce Dallas Howard who is in fact the daughter of Ron Howard. As a first time roll, she's the only one that made you think otherwise about the movie. Her roll itself was played so genuinly and so perfect that it keeps you within the movie and not about what's going to happen, or about the average acting. Adrien Brody was also very good but not nearly as good as Bryce. After all, how much more better can you get than this on a first time roll?

The second thing that really saved the Village was the amazing music. With renowned violinist Hilary Hahn, the music captures the movie more than any other I've heard. I think the soundtracks may be getting better to movies as they go along. M. Night Shyamalan did a good choice for going through with James Newton Howard to score because the violins with the fast motioness feeling to the fast parts bring in a more subtle feeling. Yet, for the suspenseful part, it brings in a low uneasy feeling to the movie. There is a certain scene many can relate when the creatures are attacking, and Lucius grabs Ivy's hand and the two rush into the basement. This is my all time favorite moment when Hilary Hahn plays the violin at its best, and it gets gorgeous. Even though it's supposed to be an intense moment, you can't help but be humbled by the beautiful music.

The special features on the DVD aren't limited, and come with some pretty unsuspecting things that really catch your attention, and sometimes take your surprise and make you laugh. And the movie itself did in fact have some laughs, and for you might expect from review, it is good at times and brings in something unexpecting and surprising to it, and if it weren't for those creatures I waited five months to see, I would've never have gotten it.

The only thing that would've made this movie a five star everything is that if Shyamalan wouldn't be such a one trick pony. His movies are awesome, and they build you up to expectations that were usually met with Signs and The Sixth Sense, but not with the Village. I think he wanted to go into a little more slower pace than his last movies, but when you have something that's amazing, don't change it into something else. The audience always feels they're in need of finding what they've waited for, not finding something completely different. I've found the trailer terrifying, and that's pretty much it. All in all, it's a good movie, and passed all through the flaws, it's worth 4 stars for originality. I hope Bryce Dallas Howard comes back in more movies. She was the only one that made the movie worth while. I'll keep watching M. Night Shyamalan, I just hope he can come up with more like Signs.",1107302400,4,5052,4.454054054054054

I did think it was strange that even though this is supposed to take place in what, the 18th or 19th century, the english seemed to be a little off.  There is a reason for this later on.

Astute viewers will notice that a key element of his three previous films is absent in this one, but it is certainly not missed.

Bryce Dallas Howard is very good in her debut lead role, and the bonus DVD footage of her diary shows how dedicated she was to immersing herself in the Ivy Walker character. Equally impressive is James Newton Howard's Academy Award nominated score, featuring another young female star, violinist Hilary Hahn. Adrien Brody also plays his supporting part well.

Some reviewers complain about the appearance of the creatures, but if you pay attention to the film, or watch the bonus DVD features, you'll see why this film never intended to compete with Lord of the Rings in the monster makeup department.

The one problem surrounding this film is that the trailers and marketing skew the viewers' expectation. If you expect to be horrified, you could be disappointed. There are some scary elements, but that's not the gist of the film.

The first downfall was the appearance of the creatures.  A good adjective to describe these monsters is: cheesy.  They appeared to be straight from a low-budget 1980 horror flick.  And the film never quite redeemed itself.  The storyline became less and less believable; and when the big surprise was revealed, I just had to laugh.

I wish movie companies wouldn't do that, I think it leads to more disappointment for the viewers and when word gets around, they lose people who would have watched it if the marketing was more honest to begin with!  But with that said, back to my review.

I saw this movie first in the theatre.  The first time I saw it, I thought the first 2/3 of the movie was really boring (this was largely due to the misleading marketing).  But I think after seeing it all the way through, the second time I saw it (on DVD) it was not boring and I really liked it.  It has a classic M. Night plot twist (actually two).  The first I figured out ahead of time, the second one (the BIG one) I left the theatre going ""Huh?""

Everything is going well in the ""19th centuryish"" town.  ""They"" live on their side, and the villagers live their lives on the inside, grateful for what they have been given.

Yet life is never that simple, for the creatures start crossing borders, and inner romantic struggles shake the village to its foundation.

The acting was ok, and the story was decent.  I'd say it's too Giver-like, but that's also it's main redeeming quality.  This is not a standout by any means (for M. Night, or in general), as it is too long by about an hour!

In addition, the trailers were too misleading; they attracted the wrong audience, and dispersed those who would really like it.  So you can give ""The Village"" a chance, but alas to say only a mediocre film waits.",1107043200,4,864,4.713333333333333

It doesn't, and I'm proud to say that's the only reason I bothered with this garbage.  To horror fans: this is NOT a horror movie.  It is yet another big budget failure on the part of M. Night Shyamalan, who to this viewer has yet to prove himself as a director of any uniqueness or originality.  ""The Sixth Sense"" has to be one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen, and fortunately this one didn't fool anybody.  His ""trick"" formula at the end of his films doesn't work very well, since by the time we reach the end we're so bored and amused by the bad performances and absurd plots that we don't really care what the surprise is.

I don't know what he was aiming for with this.  It doesn't work as a mystery, horror, or even a romance.  Even the veterans of Hollywood like Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt turn in mediocre performances.  They probably just needed work.

The plot is barely worth getting into.  A village of people who live sorta like puritans (minus any ascetic intensity, or intensity of any kind) are afraid of ""those they don't speak of"", creatures they believe live in the woods.  We find out very quickly that these creatures are merely costumes and that the whole thing is a ploy by ""the elders"" to keep them away from modern civilization.

This was the most drawn out, overbearing, gut wrenchingly dull film I've seen in the longest time.

He is so legendary that he puts a 3 minute film of himself in the extra segments on each DVD; films from his childhood showing how brilliant he was even then as an actor and director.

The fact is he is very over rated. Until his body of work grows to the lengths and consistency of true greats, the addition of his name to the films titles will only be an act of ego not legend.

2167536,3,B00064LJVO,"It's difficult to judge a movie based on the director's previous works, but it's difficult not to as well.  So as someone who is STILL scared when thinking of ""The Sixth Sense,"" I rented this movie with the intention of being scared outta my mind.  And while it failed severely in scaring me, ""The Village"" is still a pretty decent flick.

The good?  Great production value with a palpable sense of fear filling every shot.  It was easy to feel what the villagers feel.  The ""twist"" is also quite thought-provoking in the sense that it makes you think about such incidents happening in real life.  And while it has been said before, it's worth repeating that Bryce Dallas Howard truly carries the film with vulnerability and depth.

The bad?  Not scary enough!  I wanted to be sleeping with my lights on for a few days afterwards.  Also, with the number of fantastic actors in this movie, much of their talent was wasted.  It seems that M. Night is a fan of underacting and hollow performances.

M. Night has the potential for becoming a great director, if only he would branch out and try new things.  And at the same time, we the audience should allow him the freedom to try something new.  ""The Village,"" while having a great set-up and great actors, ultimately fails to satisfy.  Perhaps a buddy comedy should be his next project?",1106697600,2,1334,4.6127659574468085

""Those we do not speak of"" but are having a council meeting concerning them. Also i understand that the director won't show the monster for sometime in his movies (like in signs) but I got so bored with this movie that I turned it off before I even saw it (if there is one) and was then too sleepy to fast foward.

2167538,3,B00064LJVO,"Shyamalan sets up an interesting premise but there are too few twists and turns to keep this movie compelling throughout.  He gives away the secret of the village too soon, offering little in the way of suspense to close out the movie.  Too bad because the film was relatively taut in the first half and enjoyable to watch.

The premise is a village not much unlike that of a Shaker village nestled in the primordial woods.  The elders have chose to turn their backs on the town, keeping vigilant watch on the borders with the the dark forest that separates them from civilization.  Fine performances by Hurt, Weaver, and Phoenix keep this film moving along at a brisk pace.  M. Night captures the cadence of 18th century English, further lending to the old world air of this movie.  But, ultimately love turns into a near fatal dagger that forces a young blind woman to have to brave the hundred acre woods to find medicine for her fallen lover.

Absurd as the premise of a blind woman forced to find her way through a forest to a town she has no idea where it lies, Shyamalan is able to create some air of suspense.  But, it was a little bit too much like The Blair Witch Project as she stumbles around the woods trying to find her bearings after her escorts forsake her.

I suppose for younger audiences, a movie like this can be a lot of fun, but for older audiences it will be hard to stifle a smirk and a laugh from time to time.  Shyamalan is out of his realm in trying to create a Gothic movie.  Better to stick to lighter projects like Stuart Little.",1106697600,2,1559,4.375

  Since when has Hollywood or television been logical?  Isn't this the same America that made Friends, Seinfeld and Cheers into hits - while forcing America to believe that there were no people of color to be found in either New York or Boston.  Hollywood made us believe that a white man could become a samurai and that anybody could rob a casino.
  The great thing about movies is that they are mostly illogical, and make entertainment from things that could probably never happen.  It's just a darn movie, not doctrine.
  As for the Village, it wasn't Shyamalan's best - but Unbreakable was my favorite so what do I know.  I go to see his movies because they are, even if only slightly, different from anything else out there.  They challenge me to think about the world that's greater than the movie, because of the themes that he evokes.  This is evident in the over 500 reviews this movie is getting on this site.

After watching the film, I couldn't stop thinking about it. I'll admit it, at first, there were somethings that I couldn't make sense of, but there was some reason that I liked it that I couldn't quite put my finger on. I went out and bought the DVD on the release day and watched it over. Wow...big difference. Anyone who has seen M. Night movies by now should know, every time you watch a film of his, you'll learn something new that you didn't catch last time. I also noticed how moving a story it really is. For people out there looking for a scare, it has it's dark and foreboding elements in it, and a several great jump scenes (If you watch it at home, watch at night with the lights out, and turn up the volume. M. Night's scares and threatening elements in his film often involve sound and noises). I will make this plain and clear though: this movie is different then any other M. Night has made before. The central theme is a love story, which is incredibly moving and pure, and the soundtrack is breathtaking. Another pivotal theme is the theme of facing ones fears, and in the end Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) will have to face her fears for the one person she loves the most. For all the people who have trash talked the movie, they do so because they expect a movie that will make them poop their pants and they probably don't really give a damn about the story or emotional basis of this incredible story. It's got scares, it's got emotionally moving scenes, but most importantly, it is a great story with great themes and plot points. M. Nights best work yet, If you are like me, you'll be left wishing the movie was longer. Well executed, and a beautiful story.",1106438400,2,1846,4.400584795321637

I was expecting my mind to be played with, I was expected a shocking twist, I expected to be a little scared. I like horror movies, I wanted some scary bits. I settled down, put the movie in, and watched.

What a waste of my time.

This movie was extremely predictable. The surprise 'twist' at the end wasn't surprising, shocking, or any other s word that is supposed to indicate that I didn't see that one coming.

The 'scary' parts were pathetic. It was broad daylight and nothing was scary at all. The monsters were pathetic, and any part where some drama was supposed to be conveyed just failed to do so.

The blind girl was completely unconvincing. Come on, the girl is running everywhere and pretending to use a guide stick, which she does terribly. She barely taps the ground every 5 or 6 steps. She could have fallen to her death in the time between taps. And she can see people's 'color'? Come on! How lame.

So this entire movie wasted my Friday night, and was a waste of time and money for anyone to take part in. Don't even bother; this movie will not appease anyone with a sense of taste.

2167549,5,B00064LJVO,"I've read a lot of the other reviews and am frankly disappointed with many of them. The reasons that I have read for why these other people believed the movie was bad weren't really good. It's all based on opinion. I respect what the other people are saying, but some of it is just stupid. It's obvious that half the people didn't watch the movie closely at all or else they would've picked up on how M. Night filled in the blanks that they claimed made the movie flawed and unbelievable. If many of these people had simply paid attention to the details, then maybe we wouldn't be forced to read the reviews they posted that are based on something that they simply didn't pick up on.

Another thing that bothered me is that people are also saying that the movie wasn't a psychological thriller, which it very clearly was. Many people seem to get scary movie and thriller mixed up. A thriller is a movie with twists and turns, a revelation at the end, and other things along these lines. A thriller doesn't necessarily make a movie scary to watch, like the movie ""Memento"" for example. ""The Village"" is most definitely a thriller and rightly marketed as such.

This movie was probably one of the most well-done movies that I have ever seen. It's so nicely shot and the music is great. I think that this movie was probably the best one Shyamalan has made aside from ""The Sixth Sense."" But then again, that's just my opinion.

2167550,4,B00064LJVO,"Nay-say what you will, M. Night Shyamalan is consistent in his apparent mission to encourage his audience to look beyond the obvious to discover aberrant alternatives to the explanation of nature, including humans and their motivations.  THE VILLAGE is a very good movie if taken as another chapter in Shyamalan's odyssey.  If it doesn't have the shock jolt that his early successful film THE SIXTH SENSE had, then perhaps it is more because we as audience are beginning to understand his take on reality versus the unknown.

The village of the title suggests a cult community of people dressed in 19th century garb, living off the land, abhorring money and its evil influence on mankind, and maintaining a status of coexistence with Those We Do Not Speak Of whose domain is the woods surrounding the plot of land designated for the villiage. We learn that each of the villagers has a personal dark secret that defines the reason for the establishment of the commune away from the 'world'.  There is an Amish flavor in dress and speech and government that makes this strange place appealing.  The villagers have all taken an oath not to cross the line into the woods to go to the 'towns' beyond.  It is this schism that is challenged in the story and the results of the individual will to risk because of the all-important concept of Love that is the journey through which Shyamalan guides us.

The cast includes Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's daughter in a fine first performance as the blind heroine), Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Cherry Jones, Michael Pitt and Adrien Brody and they do well with the rather stiff script they are given (the odd 19th century versus 21st century method of speaking is but one of the clues to Shyamalan's secret ending).  The photography is lovely, moody, and atmospheric and the haunting solo violin playing by Hilary Hahn of the score by James Newton Howard contribute elegantly to enhancing the mood of the film.

No, this is not a great movie, but taken for what it is - another step toward the mystery of the universe conundrum - it succeeds well, at least to this viewer.  Grady Harp, January 2005",1106438400,,2159,4.779569892473118
2167551,4,B00064LJVO,"I haven't written a review in a while, probably because I haven't really felt passionate about most of the releases these days. Not that I haven't enjoyed them at a certain level, just not to the point of being inspired to write about the experience.... Until I experienced The Village! What is it about the movie that has inspired me, you ask??? Well, you've probably read the reviews that basically said that M. Night Shyamalan has failed on his 4th big picture release. How it wasn't scary and failed on the twisty ending, unlike the successful ""The Sixth Sense"". Well, I am here to tell you that he was successful in what he set out to do with this movie. In the sense that he touched on multiple themes; the ""horror/suspense"" flavors that he likes to sprinkle on his movies was present, and just like his other movies, was NOT the main theme. The Village does touch on romance and also flirts with that unknown element that all his movies seem to have, whether it is; dead people, super powers, aliens or in this case, monsters; it had that suspenseful layer. It just wasn't as heavy or as prevalent as in his other movies, but it was injected just enough to add the unknown and make you feel a little uneasy at times. It also has the twist ending.  But, the main theme to this movie is Humanity, the human spirit and how flawed it is. It's flawed because it loves, hates, cares, is indifferent, beautiful, ugly, good and evil all bundled together. No matter how you try to hide it, or reinvent it, the true nature of humanity will always come out. That is what this movie is about. The human spirit and how it needs to soar high. That our dreams and desires cry out and inevitably consume us. The Village is about a journey to ""Shangri-La"" but ends up right were it started! You probably want a synopsis of some type but I know that you have read it in all the other reviews that are listed and I wanted to give you something more than a summary; I wanted to give you the reason to get this film. I like M. Night Shyamalan's movies, I own them all and I rate the village 3 on the list, just ever-so behind Signs and much better than unbreakable. It is a shame that M. Night has been unofficially given the task of saving the horror/suspense movie genre, since his movies are so much more!

2167552,3,B00064LJVO,"Like every other film by M. Night Shyamalans films, we are left to figure out the big twist at the very end that will be sure to make our hair stand on end as they did in ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs.""

However this one twist in the movie tends to be toned down a bit, which is sort of a surprise and kind of a dissapointment, considering Shyamalan has been on a role. Nonetheless this film is still full of twists and turns that will keep you guessing till the end, it did for me.

The main plot is that a village of people, that is set sometime in the 1800's, are completely cut off from the world. They live in their small town surrounded by woods where these creatures also live in.

At first we do not know much about them except for the fact that they are called, ""Those we do not speak of,"" by the townsfolk, and also the fact that they are attracted to the color red. Whether the color is on clothes, berries, or flowers, the color is called the ""bad color"" and is buried in the ground right away if seen anywhere near the village. The people in the village do not go into the woods, and the creatures in the woods do not go into the village.

Joaquin Phoenix plays Lucius, a quiet young man that does not fear the creatures, in fact he does not fear anything at all, except for the saftey of another which I will talk about later.
As far as the plot is concerned, Lucius is only in the first half as a man who has to write out what he wants to say in order for him to actually say it.

When dead animals start to show up in the village many people are afraid that the creatures are starting to break the truce they have with people. At first they pretend the acts are by coyotes, but when more and more start showing up, the people start to worry even more.

Despite the fact that the movie does try to stick to the plotline, several moments were pretty slow, but Shyamalan tries to keep it interesting by showing several moments of suspense that only he can deliver, including a few seconds of us actually seeing the creatures in the light. And believe me, they are nothing what you will expect.

Bryce Dallas Howard makes her acting debut I believe in this movie as Ivy, the daughter of the leader of the town who is also blind. But she is a remarkable person who can actually do a lot of what other people cant, and she is great in this movie. She is also the character that Lucius is afraid of for her safety.

And to those of you who saw the movie ""The Pianist"" did you actually think you would see Adrian Brody as the character that he is here? Kind of a real shocker if you think about it.

As for the scary scenes, they definately deliver, my opinion, and are relatively evened out in the movie, though the first hour rearely has them. The scene in the woods with Ivy I'll admit were suspensful, and it was in daylight too.

The ending isn't the greatest, but this definately isn't the worst movie you will see. Sure it isn't on the same level as Shyamalan's others, but everyone has to take a break now and then, right? Anyway this is a great movie to rent, and definately not worth throwing it in the trash.",1106352000,3,3126,4.195
2167553,2,B00064LJVO,"NOTE:  This review is completly spoiler free.  It reveals nothing about the movie that is critical to the plot, but does reveal moments (that are not described) at specific points in the movie.  The ending is not revealed in this review.

I feel sorry for M. Night Shyamalan.  He's now known as the guy who always has a breathtaking suprise ending in every movie he does, and each ending has to be better then the last.  That tremendous wieght must have been wieghing down on him the entire time he made this movie.

The Village's plot can best be described as ""The amish meet ""Aliens"" "".  A quiet town from the 1800's is surrounded by nasty creatures ""those we do not speak of"".  A truce has been in place for years, where both sides do not intrude upon the other.  But lately, things have been happening, and the truce begins to unwind...

Sounds like a great plot right?  It is, and it has the possibility to be so great.  A village in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by hostile creatures, and now the villages inhabitants have to figure out what to do to survive.  Yet despite a strong start and buildup, the whole movie comes crashing down in the third act, but more on that later.

I think the main problems with this movie lie within its charachters and the ending.  When first watching the movie, I really didint care for any of the charachters.  It was a little hard to tell them apart, and we got little personality out of each.  The great actress Sigourney Weaver is completly wasted in this movie, getting almost no screen time whatsoever.  Late in the movie I was secretly hoping for a scene where she would save the villiage by riding out on a powerloader made out of wood, going up to the creatures threatening Ivy and saying ""Get away from her you B****!""  It would be very entertaining yes, but sadly dosent happen.

The central charachter, a blind teenager named Ivy, is not very interesting to me.  She's not annoying, but she has a lukewarm personality.  I never felt that she realy loved her future husband, which is crucial to the plot.  What's really strange is that her blindness appears to be random.  She needs a cane to see where she's going most of the time, but at other moments she runs at top speed through a field, into a bushy area and onto a rock.  The most ridiculous moment is when she looks at someone coming up to her and says ""Oh, it's you.""  Uh, what?  Isint she supposed to be blind?

Aside from below-average charachters, the Village is luckster in terms of scares.  There is nothing really creepy or scary about the movie.  I will admit there are a few frightenig moments involving the creatures from the woods, but thats it.  Speaking of the creatures, the is one thing that Shyamalan does get right is creepy monster designs.  When you see these beasts, they do have a great design thats memorable and creepy.

Probably the worst thing about the Village is it's third act.  Everything about the story goes completly downhill after a few scenes, ruining everything that comes before it.  A monumental mistake Shyamalan makes is revealing the secret behind the creatures from the woods a full thiry minutes before the film ends!  That is simply inexcusable!  As a result of this horrendus mistake, the last scenes with the creatures were silly, as I knew the secret behind them (and no, i'm not going to tell you what it is).

And the ending, which is Shyamalan's trademark, is simply sad.  Although it was a small suprise when I began to see it, the rest of it was a sad, sad joke.  After the last scene was over, and the credits began to roll, the first thing I said was ""uh...what?""  The ending did make sense and was not confusing, but it was a bad ending that could have been so much more.  Chud.com's DVD review has a suggestion as to how it could have played out, and sadly the version they suggest would have been much better.  Bottom line:  The ending is dissapointing and easily the weakest ending in all of Shyamalan's movies.

I so wish I could say what could have been done to make this a great movie, but I cannot withought spoiling the plot and the ending.  So you'll have to see it and come to your own conclusion.  But it's sad how the setting and the creatures are fantastic, yet the charachters and the plot are dull.  How sad.",1106352000,7,4291,4.481912144702842
2167554,2,B00064LJVO,"For a movie with a good cast and presumably no budget worries, the village is a movie which could have and should have been better. I seem to recall the story line concept from an old Twilight Zone episode, tho I haven't seen it in years. This doesn't surprise me as M. Night borrowed the storyline for Signs so directly from War of the Worlds. He seems to be pursuing the title of King of the remakes. Too many ""little"" things with the Village bothered me. As small cut off Village in the middle of nowhere, where did they get Glass for their windows, metal for their knives and utensils, oil for their night torches, new clothes etc. I didn't notice a glass factory, blacksmith shop, millwork or any other work place in the village, however they have all of the produce from them. Also, I was surprised to see the blind girl who is the central character of the movie run full speed across a field, wander thru the woods and navigate without hesitation down a cellar ladder when having known several blind people in my life, none of them would even dream of performing such feats even in their own homes. It just wasn't realistic. Finally to the story itself, I believe it would have been far better, if there truly had been ""something"" in the woods, a true adversary, a true ""boogie"" man. It beomes obvious early on that this isn't the case and that the village elders are behind the hoax. There are too many flaws in the plot logic to attempt to list, suffice it to say you have to suspend all reality to accept that the Village is actually what it prsenets itself to be and that no one within it has figured out the truth. I was very dissapointed by this, as I felt Sixth Sense was excellent and Unbreakable very good. M. Night as the park ranger at the end of the film was yet another borrow from Steven King, who borrowed the cameo concept from Hitchcock.

2167556,5,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan has put so many elements into his films, it is a shame that most people only go in looking to be 'fooled'. Or looking for a 'scare'. His movies are character analyses that not only tell a story, but also reveal the nature of its characters in a way that you can relate to...Even if in a metaphoric sense.

He pulls back the curtain on this drama set in the days of old, and shows us once again that the most frightening thing out there can be 'realization'. Sometimes ignorance is bliss.

All in all, M. Night's movies grow more mature as they come along, and I find myself watching them over and over just to feel the 'experience' he creates with his amazing eye for direction. I wonder what he'll do next.",1106352000,,726,4.330882352941177
2167557,2,B00064LJVO,"First let me say that I'm not a fan of M. Night Shyamalan.  I find him to be a good director, but a bit of a hack when it comes to plot.

This movie was probably his best plot.  The ""twist"" of it was perhaps a bit obvious; I was suspicious of it by 3 minutes into the movie and certain of it by 30 minutes in.  However, the basic premise is interesting.  Handled differently, this might have actually been a really good film.

The directing was something any hack with a camera could have done.  The scene editing made the first half hour boring, which made the rest of the movie neither scary nor interesting.  The camera angle selection also would lead one to believe an amature was shooting this film.  Only one scene, where Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix discuss their feelings on a porch after a creature attack, does Shyamalan show us what he is capable of.

In short, don't waste money to see this, but if it's free and you've got nothing better to do, it isn't unbearable.",1106265600,3,989,4.355191256830601
2167558,2,B00064LJVO,"Look, I didn't particularly like this movie, but there are some real bozos who have written reviews here. People are complaining that the monsters did not look realistic. Good grief! Did you even watch the whole movie? The elders were dressed up as monsters! Of course they weren't realistic!

And who said that they would see planes overhead? It was clearly stated that the airlines were paid off not to fly overhead.

Then someone complains that the 'wildlife preserve' makes no sense and is not explained. What the? It was clearly shown that the billionairre founders set it up and funded it. And someone asked where are the animals. Sheesh. Let me sit down for a moment while you search for your brain.

I'm not trying to defend the movie, because it wasn't very good. It was predictable. To me, the biggest plot hole was the fact that they wanted to go and live a separate peaceful life, yet they try to do so by terrifying all of the others into submission? Gee, what a pleasant life to live, especially for the children. That's much more wholesome and peaceful than the regular world.

Another ludicrous part was the oh-so-convenient pit in the ground that Ivy used to kill the monster. Lucky that was there!

But, considering the rest of the trash being made by Hollywood, it is relatively no worse than most movies. And surely by now people are expecting big holes in Shymamalan's twists? They're in all of his others.",1106265600,3,1427,4.669322709163347

Night Shyamalan movie and that it was supposedly creepy. It had a few 'thrilling' moments but I found it to be a lot more than that. What does everything in life come down to, no matter who or where you are? Love. A person will do anything for love and that's what the whole movie is based around. Though far different from most love stories we've seen. There were so many parts in the movie that I could actually feel myself in because they were thoughts and feelings I personally experienced. It pulls you in like that and makes you look deeper into it. Though the ending didn't surprise me, I was stil left with many questions at the end of the movie to think about. It makes you think and it makes you feel. This is one of the best movies I've seen in an incredibly long time and an hour after watching it, I'm still sitting here thinking about it.

Bottom Line: If you're not a deep person then you won't like this movie but if you are, you'll be awed.",1106265600,2,1106,4.168224299065421

Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard, is definitely a force to be reckoned with; she is so natural and lovely, there is no question that her career in on the move. Also, William Hurt showed more passion than I've seen from him since ""Children of a Lesser God"". Hey! He can still act. This was a good performance. Adrian Brody was fine; he probably finished this just before he won his Oscar. And...I've loved Sigourney Weaver in almost everything she's done, and she didn't let me down.

It must be the huge success of Signs that caused Hollywood to obligate MNS to come up a new movie ASAP, even if he hasn't written a great script. Ultimately, he managed to put in his usual twisted ending to the story that made it a total different kind of movie, and it's no longer a horror film!
Big stars like Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt had insignificant roles in this movie, and it was totally wasted their time. Fresh off his Oscar Winning The Pianist, Adrian Brody found nothing more interesting than playing a small part(a retarded villager who dressed up as a monster to scare off any one from going into the wood, so that they will always stay in the village(the 1800's) away the the world(modern time). It's totally unworthy of his appearance in this film, because he doesn't speak, and his role requires him to deliver 10% of what he did in The Pianist.
By the time the young blind heroine seeked her way to the outter world to obtain medicine, and encounter a police on the street, that's when the big twist comes in. I mean, even when monster(Brody) got killed in the woods, and it was already an indication that there was no monster, and the village is simply victims of surcumstances from the outside world, and that they chose to abandon it for good.
Now the reason I was disappointed by this movie is 1: great cast for the poor characters. 2: poor plot made it looked like MNS got his feet on two boats at the same time. I guess if I didn't expect it to be a horror, then I probably give one more star.",1106265600,3,1703,4.426751592356688

The twist ending? I kept asking my wife like five minutes after the movie if that was it. ""Yes, that was it"" and Im sitting here wondering, did I miss something? Nope.

2167567,4,B00064LJVO,"If you want to compare this to other M. Night films -- Signs, Unbreakable, and the witty, dark, and exciting The Sixth Sense -- then you might feel a bit let down here. Although this film has many M. Night themes running through it, it doesn't come close to The Sixth Sense in my humble opinion. But it does beat the cr@$ out of most of the DVD junk that's come out lately.

The film: The story starts off with a funeral in 1897. A young person has died and been buried in The Village. A father mourns, the young cry, and the elders look on, equally saddened . . . but not for the same reasons. For the elders of The Village harbor secrets; deep, personal secrets that could rip their little community apart.

Surrounding The Village is a mysterious forest that moans and creeks eerily. And inside the forest it is known that a horrible creature lives, threatening to disembowel anyone who gets too near its borders or, God forbid, enter the woods.

Enter Lucius Hunt (played well by Joaquin Phoenix), a young man who doesn't fear the forest as much as the other villagers and asks the elders permission to go through the forest and into the nearby towns and find new medicines to treat those that might eventually become sick. The elders refuse.

During all of these dark goings-ons, a blind girl, Ivy Walker  (Bryce Dallas Howard, Ron Howard's daughter), falls in love with Lucius. They plan to marry. But before they can, Lucius is nearly murdered by one of The Village's inhabitants. He must receive medicine or die.

Ivy takes on the challenge to walk through the demonic forest and to the towns so that she might find medicine for her dying fiance (initially she goes with two young boys who later chicken-out. After all, she's blind and would need a guide.).

But what truly lies beyond the borders of the woods? Will the beasts that live within the forest let her pass? Or will they kill her, too?

My biggest beef with the movie was that I figured out what was really going on long before the end of the film (something I was not able to do with The Sixth Sense...and I think M. Night was trying to pull of another ""fooled you"" scenario, but failed miserably).

But even WITH this problem, the film was well made; the musical score was excellent; the costumes perfect, the acting superb (especially for new screen star Bryce Howard, whom I think we'll be seeing more of), and the sets stunning.

I also have to mention this incredible all-star cast:

Bryce Dallas Howard, as Ivy Walker (movie debut)

Joaquin Phoenix, as Lucius Hunt (from Signs, Gladiator)

Adrien Brody, as Noah Percy (remember him from The Pianist?)

William Hurt, as Edward Walker ('nough said)

Sigourney Weaver, as Alice Hunt (in a period piece! Yep...)

Brendan Gleeson as August Nicholson (from Troy and Harry Potter)

...and the list just keeps going!

Not surprisingly, the cast made this film VERY enjoyable. Will I watch it again? Definitely.",1106179200,,2929,4.632495164410058
2167568,5,B00064LJVO,"Sure, the previews make you think the movie might be ""spookier"" than what it turns out to be, but I think this only drives home the point all the more. The beauty of what Shyamalan does in The Village is below the surface because it is allegory. At least, that is how I interpret the movie.

For instance, one of the more important themes of the movie is that people need to face their fears instead of running away from them.

Forgive me if I sound haughty, but the reaction that most people have to this movie is just a damning indictment of the American populace in general and its inability to think critically. I am no genius but I wish people would try to be more thoughtful when watching a movie, as you ought to be when reading a book or examining a work of art.
Obviously something like Dumb and Dumber is not supposed to provoke any deep thought but it is clear that Shyamalan wants to stir things up in this dramatic thriller.

I believe it is well done and very clever; it is one of my favorite movies of all time. If you want to think a little, during and after a movie, you might like this movie as much as I do.",1106179200,2,1126,4.179723502304148

Night Shyamalan's films the first time is to know very little about it beforehand, so I will refrain from adding another of the many ""spoiler"" reviews of this film.  Part of the fun of Shyamalan's films is trying to guess the twist (or twists), since he has a mystery writer's flair for doling out clues and misdirection as you go.  But that's only part of it.  Within days of seeing this film, my wife and I had to watch it again, because it is simply great storytelling.

A village at uneasy peace with monsters in the surrounding woods... you know from the outset to expect something out of the ordinary.  This isn't a horror movie.  It isn't a monster movie.  It is a movie about believable people dealing with their fears, whatever their basis.

Instead, it was pushed as a horror film and let me tell you the scares are few and far between. The secret ""twist"" is reviewed about an hour in and then there's another half hour to go just to drive the point home.  I pretty much had the ""twist"" figured out about 40 minutes in and let me tell you, it's pretty disappointing.  The Village doesn't reach the clever heights of the Sixth Sense or the suspenseful thrills of Signs, instead it starts off hot but when the ""twist"" is revealed it's lukewarm at best.

2167573,2,B00064LJVO,"The Village is the second M. Night Shyamalan film that I've seen. Having never wanted to watch The Sixth Sense again since the obvious ""duh!"" plot twist at its end (for the record, I did not suss it out before it was revealed), I have passed on seeing any of his subsequent efforts.

That changed with The Village, which had an intriguing trailer. This movie I was actually looking forward to seeing.

So, the wife and I sit down last weekend to watch the DVD. And it starts out pretty good. The setting appears to be an American village in the late 1890s, though that can only be inferred from the setting, and from tombstone at the funeral that is taking place as the movie opens.

The story seems to blend two overlapping plotlines. The first is a long-standing truce between the villagers and ""those we do not speak of"" that is mainly conditioned on the villagers not going into the woods where the unnamed creatures live; the second is a love story involving a boy who wants permission to go to ""the towns"" to retrieve medicines and the blind daughter of one of the village elders.

This being an M. Night Shyamalan picture, there is a plot twist. And this one I saw coming (sort of) ten miles away, thanks to odd references by the adult characters to the locked black boxes in their homes, and to the reason why their siblings were not living in the village.

When this plot twist is revealed, it is difficult to feel anything but cheated at such cheap storytelling. In that instant, my feelings towards the characters in the story and their situation changed from compassion to pity and contempt. Unfortunately, I really cannot say more without potentially spoiling the story for others (though some reviewers already have, it seems).

The really sad part is that I was really enjoying the movie up to that point.

I have learned my lesson. There will be no more M. Night Shyamalan movies in my future.

The premise, however, was just too unvelievable.  A group of adults, on what appears to be a game reserve, successfully keeping the outside world a secret from their children for decades, even at the cost of their lives....I don't think so. He might have sold me on that part if he hadn't added a blind girl who seems to be able to find her way around this game preserve just fine....even to the point of being able to trap and kill a sighted stalker....sorry, I just couldn't buy that. And in the final minutes of the movie, a mininum wage park ranger finds a blind girl on the side of the road and on the basis of a short conversation with her, risks his job by stealing prescription drugs for her with his boss sitting in the room....please!

It was a noble idea and the parent's resolve to keep their children protected from the outside world was dramatic and powerful. But despite the fact that the parents had somehow arranged for no planes to fly over the reserve, just doesn't hold water.  High flying military jets can be seen easily from the ground and are rarely subject to low altitude, no fly zones.

By and large Hollywood sells us stars in situations -- see Arnold kill bad guys and get the girl, see Meg Ryan fall in love..again...and again...

What sets MNS apart is that he is a moralist first, a storyteller second, and a Hollywood exec third (if at all), and I think it is this distinctive counter-programming that is the secret to his success -- his brand has become synonimous with plot-driven movies engaging fundamental themes.

I know everyone will expect the plot twist, and there's enough foreshadowing that it's easier to spot than in some of his previous efforts, but that's not the reason to see this film.

The reason you want to see this film is the relationship between Lucius (played in a very restrained, deeply emotional way by Joaquin Phoenix) and Ivy (played brilliantly by Bryce Howard -- she sells you on her blindness and her capability and perspicacity, not an easy combination to pull off from an acting standpoint) -- some of the scenes between them are lyrically lovely, and then you realize after the twist is revealed, how lyrical and meaningful the interactions among the elders, and between the elders and the next generation are.

While ""The Village"" is a beautiful to look at movie it fails entirely as either a love story or a horror story.  The actors speak in a kind of pseudo Colonial American.  The plot moves along at a snail's pace.  The, so called, ""others of which we do not speak"" are neither scary nor are they paticularly threatening. The love story is down right silly. By the end of this mess I was joyfully rooting for the untimely death of the movie's young hero and heroine.  I saw the twist at the end coming from almost the first frame.

It is dark yet at the same time you cannot help but feel the passion and beauty of all the things going on. You should not look at this movie just as a horror film and nothing else because if you do you will be extremely dissapointed. It has its scary moments but really it is more of a dramatic love story with a great storyline. It is all about the atmosphere and how M. Night Shyamalan put it all together. It is just simply beautiful!! The most amazing performance in the movie is that of Ivy Walker played by Bryce Dallas Howard. She is a the young blind heroine of this movie and is simply amazing for her first theatrical debut. Although she is not truly stunningly beautiful in the film, there is something about her that you cannot take your eyes off her. She is the brightest spot in a movie with so many bright areas. This movie does not get the credit it deserves. Yes you may or may not be suprised by the ending and you might not be even one bit scared of anything that happens.

And of course, Adrien Brody and Joaquin Phoenix performed brilliantly.  Brody was a very convincing love-smitten (that friendship kind of love, I assume), mentally retarded young man who fancied the beautiful Ivy Walker.

I actually thought the ending was very interesting.  I don't want to give away any of the movie, but I do believe this movie makes one think about society and how much influence it plays in shaping our minds.  I believe we (humans) need to think about how the constant bombardment of negative influences (terrible news stories, hate, political propaganda, etc.) affects us.  This movie really makes one examine those issues.

This is also a movie that examines one-on-one friendships and conversations.  The Village is not a scary movie, but the concept of society flowing along without realizing how it manipulates the human mind is indeed, scary.

This movie is worth the watch.  Just don't expect to be all that scared.

When I saw the trailer to this movie I thought I was going to get a very scary movie like Alien,which by the way starred Sigourney Weaver who is in The Village. I would suggest to M. Night Shyamalan to go back to the drawing board and see where he went wrong in writing this movie. Adrien Brody's character nearly sank the movie and so did Bryce Howard's. She is a good actress,but what was her character doing in the woods?Alone?That's like having Luke Skywalker facing Darth Vader without using the Force.

2167582,5,B00064LJVO,"People say the movie was bad. That's because they assume it's a horror film or a thriller.

It's really more of a drama, with a moral edge, and a pinch of romance.

It's good to see Shyamalan display the question of social ethics in the film. It's interesting to see the ideas and opinions of the villagers change over time, as well as the evolution of deception amongst friends and loved ones, and how it leads to no more than sorrow.

The idea of the Covington Woods creatures was good. They were quite frightening, I'll admit.

Most of all, I think an excellent aspect of this film is the imagery used. The emphasis on the swaggering trees to stimulate a certain uneasiness was perfect. The selection of bright colors used in contrast with the dull, earthen tones of the village and the dress. The red cloaks of ""those we don't speak of"" is very symbolic of the heart and blood of the villagers, which is what eventually turns out to be the evil and deception, not merely the default color of evil, save for black.

Sure, it doesn't fall into the same thriller/suspense category as ""Signs"" or ""The Sixth Sense"", but the movie was good.

Something Shyamalan actually used his heart in, not just his brain.",1106006400,,1207,4.564814814814815
2167583,5,B00064LJVO,"It's not surprising that the four deleted scenes included in the newly released DVD for M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" are just as captivating and provocative as the rest of the film. The filmmaker reveals his devotedness to his craft by prefacing each omission with a summary and, after the clip, explaining reasons for their removal in individual interviews rather than in the form of frequently annoying and unhelpful overdubbed commentary.

Indeed, the DVD for the writer/director/producer's newest critically underrated film lacks commentary, but instead features a delightful (and effectively more intimate?) six-part deconstruction of ""The Village."" While such featurettes are commonly ignored by viewers, anyone who truly appreciates Shyamalan's work will acknowledge their importance in the context of his films.

The features explore the film's remarkable on-location set, brilliant employment of sound-a facet Shyamalan describes as the extent of his ""special effects""-and a comprehensive look at James Newton Howard's scoring of the film. This truly rare treat introduces young Hilary Hahn, the score's featured violinist who receives top billing in the film's end credits and whose playing style, Shyamalan discloses, uniquely reflects the nature of the film's young heroine, Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard).

Interviews with cast members (including Adrien Brody and Sigourney Weaver), costume designers, art directors, sound engineers, and other contributors to the film reveal the extensive research and preparation required for a work of this nature-every aspect precisely crafted to maintain an element of suspense in the glow of bizarre emotional manipulation. And as with all of his movies' DVD releases, a silly short film from Shyamalan's youth finds way on the DVD.

Billed as a ""thriller,"" the DVD exposes the fundamentally poignant and artful nature of ""The Village,"" which Shyamalan masterfully describes as a ""period piece/love story."" For a film created by an underappreciated minimalist, this DVD goes to appropriate lengths to satisfy the biters and convert the critic-admirers.",1106006400,,2105,5.715654952076678

2167585,2,B00064LJVO,"Boring.  There is not one acting performance here that made me care about any of the characters in this over-hyped, sadly under-written film.  M. Night Shyamalan(writer/director), acheiving greatness on his film ""The Sixth Sense"" with 6 Oscar nominations has yet to rekindle that type of inspiration with his three films that followed: ""Unbreakable,"" ""Signs,"" and now ""The Village.""  This movie was promoted as a horror film but there are no moments in which I jumped nor did I get chills at any time.  In fact, when I saw this in the theater I was bored to the point of looking around at other audience members in the feeble hope of finding some sort of entertainment.  Half of them were asleep, the other half more than likely wondering when the story was going to get any good.  More than anything this movie had me feeling disappointed.  The pace of the film shambles along without direction or purpose, the story feels interminable, and the acting here is altogether mediocre.  Skip this one.",1106006400,7,997,4.823529411764706

I feel that many went into this movie expecting the same sort of twist ending as seen in The Sixth Sense, forgetting to enjoy the movie for what it is - an entertainment piece of art and an introspective of the human psyche.  There are many connotations that one can draw from this movie and apply them to everyday situations in the real world.  This movie gives first hand insight into the mind, fears, and desires of all of us.  How fear can consume even the strongest into becoming an instrument of that very fear.  There are lessons to be learned from the prospective this film offers, a prospective that nobody can tell if the director meant to tell.  Ignore the negative reviews, and come into watching this movie with an open mind.  Remember, Shyamalan through his prior movies has given us all a gift, the guarantee that our minds will be hyperactive for at least two hours due to our desire to ""figure out"" the plot twists.  If you see in this movie that which I have seen, your mind will be hyperactive for much longer than the time this film occupies your television screen.",1106006400,,1256,4.6008968609865475
2167588,4,B00064LJVO,First of all I think that M. Night Shymalan is a very good director. He did a very good job directing a movie that had a very simple plot. Nights obvious strongpoint is obviously his writing and the suspense. I just didn't feel he spent that time making this movie. The ending (which I won't tell you) I thought was very dissapointing. Also this is NOT a scary movie at all! So I advise people who want to see this movie just because they think it's scary should stay away. Those are my complaints. But besides that this is a very good movie. It is very well written. and well directed. It is also very suspensful. I thought that the best part of the movie was the acting Juaquin Pheonix and Bryce (Who played Ivy Walker) did a great job.,1106006400,,738,4.2785714285714285

2167590,5,B00064LJVO,"The Village is the fourth film by M. Night Shayamalan, and as with his earlier films, Night has created a film that will leave audiences guessing throughout the story.

Set in the heart of a small village at the turn of the late 18th/early 19th century, ""The Village"" is the story about a small community who live in harmony with ""those that we will not speak of"", a clan of ""creatures"" that live in the forest that surround the village itself.  Living in submission to these ""creatures"", there are those in the town who would risk everything, even death, to venture into the woods beyond to bring better medicines to the village.

Joaquin Phoenix (previously seen in ""Signs"") plays Lucius Hunt, the son of one of the town's elders.  A solitary, quiet but caring man, Lucius believes that the ailments of the town can only be solved by going beyond their borders and seeking out the aid of the people that live beyond the woods.  Ivy Walker, (skillfully played by Bryce Dallas Howard), a blind woman has fallen in love with Lucius, and their romance, in only it's infant stages, is cut short when Lucius is mortally wounded by a would-be competitive suitor, a mentally challenged man named Noah Percy.

Lucius, who is dieing, can only be helped by the aid of medicine's not available in the village.  Desperate to save her beloved, Ivy decides that she will risk the wrath of the creatures, who have previously manifested themselves whenever the members of the town have so much as taken a single step into their woods, leaving slaugtered livestock in their wake.  Without the aid of anyone or anything, she ventures forth into the woods, seeking the help of whomever-or whatever-lies beyond the woods.

Shayamalan, who takes credit for writing, producing and directing this film, weaves a story that is one part love story, one part societal drama, and one part ghost story, blending story and suspense in a way that will leave audiences clinging to the edge of their seats.  Night's characters are believable, and, as with his earlier films, drive the story and make the scary moments all the more intense, the moments of romance that much more tender, and the drama that much more believable.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a story with enough twists to keep even veteran fans of M. Night Shayamalan guessing to the very end.  For anyone familiar with Night's films, this one has his trademark twist ending, but the twist will totally take you by surprise.

Rated PG-13 for moments of horror and minor violence.

I thought the story was very well done and I completely disagree with Roger Ebert who said it was one of the worst movies of the year.,1105920000,,312,3.9682539682539684
2167592,2,B00064LJVO,I was not on the edge of my seat one bit throughout this whole movie. I had the plot figured out before I even got to the middle of it. It is not original. They did something similar to this on the Outer Limits. One of Shyamalan's worst.,1105920000,3,237,3.9583333333333335
2167593,2,B00064LJVO,"This film was a sleeper--literally.  OK, so I was really tired when I watched it, I fell asleep about 40 minutes into it, and woke up near the end.  Not only did I have a good nap, but I spared myself the utter pretentiousness of this film, whose visual interest quickly wears thin in the absence of any meaningful character or plot development.

While I am a huge fan of M. Night Shamalan's earlier works, I felt betrayed that this was marketed as a horror film, when the scariest thing about it is that I actually paid to rent it.  Far from his best work, the film lumbers along, and upon waking, my wife brought me up to speed on the plot twists in about two sentences.  Perhaps the most glaring testament to the film's ineptness is that it did not even sustain my curiosity enough to want to review what I had missed the following day.  If you're into movies with silly fixations on color and dress from an indeterminate period, then you may enjoy this.  I preferred my nap, however.",1105920000,5,987,4.3901098901098905
2167594,3,B00064LJVO,"I saw this movie in the theatre, and very much enjoyed it:  the cinematography is gorgeous, and the suspense is well-maintained.  Overall, it has the same pensive grandeur as the movie set in Amish country, Witness, with a kind of brooding suspense that Shamalayan is so good at.

The thing about a last-minute trick though is that it should make you rethink everything you've seen before; see it all in a new light.  well it does:  but then it doesn't make sense.

The only reason I didn't see the trick coming is because of a deliberate fake-out very early on.  I will admit that the story of these people stuck with me, especially once I knew the ending, but I wanted it to make more sense.  I can't really say more without spoiling it...

I will say that though Bryce Dallas Howard is wonderful, a long scene of her alone in the forest seemed to go on forever.  It's not good when you start consciously noticing the camera angles.

Still, this isn't a bad one for a rainy day.  Don't expect too much from it or examine it TOO closely, but it's beautifully shot and acted, and a pleasant diversion.  Sixth Sense it isn't, but it's still better than a lot of suspense films out there!",1105920000,2,1186,4.435185185185185
2167595,4,B00064LJVO,"""The Village"" is the latest heaping helping of creepiness served up by M. Night Shyamalan.  There are plenty of twists and turns(as expected), and an excellent ending, but the guts of this story run a little thin.

I won't spoil this story for anyone by saying what will happen, but I offer a brief synopsis of what's going on in the film.  A small village of people are living in an area surrounded by Covington Woods.  As long as they do not cross into the woods, the creatures that live there will leave them alone.  However, cross the torch-lined barrier into the forest and the red-cloaked baddies come after you with revenge on their minds.  When a situation arises needing urgent medical care, one person decides to cross into the unknown to seek out help.  What follows is classic Shyamalan, full of confusing twists and surprising turns.

I really enjoyed this film, but I felt like Shyamalan gave up too many clues early in the movie.  He neatly blurred the viewers concept of what was happening in ""The Village"" with a couple of fun twists late in the movie, but by that time I already had a pretty good idea of what was really going on.  I will say that the ending was somewhat expected from the get-go, but this was still an enjoyable film to watch.

As far as suspense is concerned, Shyamalan has perfected the art of making the viewer ""peek around the door.""  You notice this in all of his films.  When you hear a noise or see a flicker in the corner of your eye, you immediately begin to try and look around the corner, door, etc., as if you were part of the movie.  This is one of the best aspects of all of M. Night's films and has become a lost art in modern cinema as far as I'm concerned.  He has also mastered the creepy factor of true horror films.  He'd rather make you think about the ""monster"" or ""alien"" instead of see it.  ""The Village"" is a good representation of both of these techniques.  M. Night has also got the ""well, I'll be"" aspect down pat.  When you finally realize what is going on, you want to kick yourself because the truth has been staring at you on the screen all along.

The acting in this film is brilliant.  Joaquin Phoenix does a great job in this movie, perhaps better than his performance in ""Signs.""  Bryce Dallas Howard is the best performer in this flick.  She is both beautiful and graceful and has a solid grasp on her character.  Adrien Brody is convincing as the village simpleton, and you feel quite a bit of pain for his character.  The rest of the cast, including William Hurt, does a wonderful job.

Granted, this film is a little sluggish.  It moves at a pace somewhat slower than ""Signs"" and seems to need a kick to get it moving once in awhile.  Other than that, the film is fun to watch.  There are some really creepy moments in store for the viewer, and they are pulled off in a way that made me quite uncomfortable for a good portion of the film.

As always, M. Night throws in one of his old home movies to ""terrorize"" the audience in the extras(I never was really fond of German Shepherds).  There are also production photos, ""Bryce's Diary,"" and plenty of other fun extras for folks who dig that kind of stuff.

In closing, if you enjoyed ""Signs"" and ""The Sixth Sense,"" I'm sure you'll find this movie satisfying.  If ""Unbreakable"" is your favorite M. Night Shyamalan flick, you may want to skip this one.

Highly recommended to fans of Shyamalan and those who like their movies with more intelligence and less whiz-bang effects.",1105920000,,3500,4.45125786163522
2167596,4,B00064LJVO,"Despite all the hype and the fact that M.Night oddly feels the need to have his name in lights along with his movie titles, this movie was enjoyable and worth the $3 I spent to rent it. I liked it and liked the plot twists, however it does leave one with many unanswered questions. I rented the DVD and it has cool extras on it, too bad the extras do not have the answers. In the beginning of the movie, it appears that a child has died and the year is 18-something. Okay, so he died from what? And after the funeral all the villagers have a big meal on really long tables ??? After the party where do they store the tables ? If the woods are full of dudes that are ""not spoken of"" wearing Little Red Riding Hood capes, just how did the ""settlers"" get to this large clearing smack dab in the middle of the woods and then build a village? Are they really aliens and a spaceship just dropped them off with their supplies? Who kept skinning foxes and sticking them around to scare the youngins' ? That's gross. Besides, if the woods were really full of red-cloaked freaks, wouldn't the Elders have made weapons of some sort and not just have everyone hide in their cellars? Perhaps the Elders knew something that the audience didn't. Oh that's right, they did knew something, a lot of something. William Hurt played the part of the head Village Elder, and yet when medicine is needed to help a young man who is suffering stab wounds, he sends his BLIND daughter into the woods to travel to the ""towns"" to try and get some. Just what was he thinking? She was blind ! I mean he knew (but the audience still didn't), that there were no animals (at all) and no freaks in the woods, but she was still blind and could have fallen down a big muddy hole and got killed or something. Was he hoping either that she would get lucky and the miracle would happen - she would find some compassionate soul who would get her the goods and help her back into the woods and since she was blind could never tell anyone that the whole village scenario is a sham, or worse, she would be lost forever and die from exposure, which would basically send a message to the rest of the Village, an ""I told you so""??? We were supposed to believe that the villagers were living a primitive life yet it seemed like they did not go without much - they even managed to find beads to decorate a tent for a wedding.

The movie was entertaining and the twist at the end was definitely not predictable to me, however it just left me with too many unanswered questions. I did like most of the characters and thought Joaquim Phoenix is eye candy. Bryce (cool name) Howard played a convincing blind Ivy, she was lovely and had an awesome voice - just to listen to her speak was a delight. Adrian Brody as the village idiot was rather annoying, however he was the perfect actor for the part since he seemed to have no trouble playing an idiot. Had he not perished after falling in the mud hole, perhaps he would have benefited from a little medication as well. I could understand his parents anquish after his death, however you just can't have dudes running around like that stabbing people and trying to scare the hell out of people. In the real world we have jails for those who commit crimes, or in his case institutions. In the village, all they had was a ""quiet room"", which as we all saw, was not too affective. And when you are trying to scare your community into believing that they need to remain in the village and never venture into the woods, it's probably not a good idea to hide one of your freak suits under the floor boards of the ""quiet room"", since that was where the village idiot spent a lot of his time.

At the end some of the answers came to light, however it just left other questions. The score was beautifully done and watching the behind the scenes clips on the DVD were cool. At least it seemed that the actors had a good time filming it - or Night wants us to think they did. The home video that Night includes on the DVD is lame to say the least. I felt it was just more of him being proud of himself (another pat on the back to himself). He is still young so maybe he has yet to realize that true fame comes from others admiring your work and not from you just thinking that everything you do is great. Other than that I would say if you are a collector of his movies, buy it for your collection, if not pop some popcorn and just rent it.",1105920000,,4426,4.255344418052257

I bought the movie, and it literally sucked.  I give it ONE STAR, for set, scenery and costuming.  Overall costuming that is, not for that ridiculous thing ""we don't speak of"" with the porcupine quills on it's back (remember the movie with a similar creature in NIGHTBREED?). Halfway through the film, I was nearly convinced to pull the sheets over my eyes.  Not out of fear, but out of shame.  I'm ashamed I bought this.

After ""Sixth Sense"", I haven't seen anything that comes close to topping it.

It's more a love story with chilling moments. The twists in the plot were good but might be predictable to the viewer (although I didn't catch on until the movie was almost over). The director (M. Night Shyamalan) is known for these plot twists. He also did the ""Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"" and ""Unbreakable"". I own these other movies and I thought ""The Village"" was his best effort of the ones I haves mentioned. Rent it, don't buy it unless your a fan of the director's movies.",1105920000,,608,4.4375

I hate scary movies that jerk me around. My wife doesn't. She absolutely loves ""Signs,"" which I acknowledge is a very well-crafted story, but I don't like the way it jams my nervous system.

So when she decided we needed to see ""The Village,"" I went along for the ride mostly just to humor her. I was pleasantly surprised.

The thing I like most about M. Night's storytelling is his ability to surprise and he delivers again with ""The Village.""

After you've seen the film once, you can go back and pick up some subtle clues about the surprise ending, but I doubt if one in 100 viewers figures it out the first time through.

It's a classy movie with an strong cast and, even though I won't want to watch it as often as my wife will, I think it's well worth the price of the DVD.",1105920000,,884,4.301204819277109
2167610,5,B00064LJVO,"I think poor reception of ""The Village"" lies with expectations.  Too many patrons expected one thing and were severed something quite different -- hence the massive let-down that incurs.

Part of the problem lies with incessant comparison to Shyamalan's preceding films.  Watch this one anew.  Fresh.  Not expecting it to turn up like a carbon copy of ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs""... never mind ""Unbreakable"", that was awful to begin with.

Another contributing factor to the film's less-than-appropriate, sub-par rating is the film's improper promotion.  It was promoted as a sort of horror film, when in actuality it is a film about people, and the extremes we might take to content ourselves.  The previews built the film up into a kind of chill-fest, when what we got once the film was over is a chill of a different kind.

""The Sixth Sense"" was scary.  The film featured ghosts.  It was supernatural, and thrilling.  ""Signs"" also hinged on thrill and awe, mystery and fright to achieve it's success.  So no wonder that repeat Shyamalan audiences would expect the same,  legitimate frights.

The film fell from its deserving grace due to the tremendous success of its creator, and audience-grabbing promotion.  The previews and trailors for the film are false, clashing, and unfortunately deceiving.  The film suffered from it's own image.

Such a shame, because it's brilliant.

2167611,5,B00064LJVO,"Once again, M. Night Shyamalan delivers a story of great value.  Much like ""Signs"" is set at an innocuous farmhouse and the surrounding community, ""The Village"" could be any place - if that place happened to be an Amish community.  Set in a secluded pre-industrial village, the movie is more-or-less about reluctant adults making way for maturing youth.  Upon opening, the movie first appears to focus on the village's plight of lack of medicine.  Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) approaches the village elders and requests to journey through the woods to the town to retrieve medicine.  The elders, though not outright about it, blow him off.  Soon, we are introduced to blind Ivy (Bryce Howard) and slow Noah (Adrien Brody), Lucius' friends.  Through a series of nights, strange creatures referred to only as `those who shall not be named', ghastly looking beasts in red cloaks, visit the village.  After a series of unfortunate events, it is Ivy, not Lucius, who makes the journey through the woods, learning the secrets of the village along the way.

I must say, though not one of M. Night's best, ""The Village"" is an interesting movie.  The setting is beautiful, the mysterious creatures are intriguing, and the atmosphere with which the characters respond to the threat of them is quite exhilarating.  However, it seemed Mr. Shyamalan rushed this particular film in order to provide his fans with his every-other-year movie quota.  One problem I had was Ivy's trip through the woods.  Because of the overuse of flashbacks, there was no fear of the unknown.  For a girl who lived in a specific area all her life and never having gone out of that area, Ivy didn't seem afraid one bit...even if she knew a little of the truth.  There was no feel of dread or fear with her journey.  M. Night is one who delivers scares, but Ivy's trip through the woods seemed like a regular walk in the park.  There were no sounds of twigs breaking, no rustling in the bushes, no movement of shadow.  I was expecting to get a sense of ""The Blair Witch"" forest, instead it was practically a picnic until the `creature' showed up.

The twist of the movie is a great idea, but it came too soon so it felt as if the movie was over before the actual ending.  It seems as if at the point at which it was decided to have Ivy go for medicine, the answers and truth came too quickly.  It was as if M. Night dropped subtle suggestion in favor of outright explanation, as if he completely forgot the art of inference.  It would have been much more surprising had, if at the point in which Ivy climbs the vine-covered wall, the flashbacks of her knowing the truth been seen, instead of all that time before her arrival at the wall.  The truth was given to the viewer much too soon.  Then, after she climbed the wall, the movie could have focused on the elders grouping outside and the circumstances regarding Noah.  Then, the end would be the real twist of the newspaper clippings and the group photo.  I'll be honest, though an excellent movie that touches on a lot of life's issues of growing in maturity and relationships, the handling of the twist is nothing compared to ""The Others"".  But it's still worth the money to have it in your collection.",1105833600,,3217,4.627865961199294

2167614,5,B00064LJVO,"I heard the reviews of this movie, so I was sceptical of it and waited a while to see it.  However, I thought it was fantastic!  It was thought provoking and interesting, and the acting and directing was unbelievable.  It isn't a horror or a slasher film, as the promotions suggest, so those who think it is will be disappointed.  It is so much more than a horror or a slasher film though.

The story is set in the isolated village of Covington, Pennsylvania.  The close-knit community lives with the frightening knowledge that creatures reside in the surrounding woods, and no one will venture beyond the borders of the village and into the woods.  Lucius Hunt, played by Joaquin Phoenix, decides to find out what lies outside Covington, and unwittingly invites the wrath of the creatures upon the town.

The Village stars Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Adrien Brody, Judy Greer, and Bryce Dallas Howard - quite a cast!
This Manoj Night Shyamalan creation is his best yet.  The subtle nuances of the characters are brilliantly done and the slowly built up suspense works to make this a thriller and a mystery.  I was captivated by this movie.",1105833600,,1144,4.761421319796955
2167615,5,B00064LJVO,"There are people that expect Night to produce a great twist in every movie. There are people that simply cannot understand genius and will always put it down. There are people who think they know movies, because they watched Titanic twice. If you are one of these people, then sit back, relax and do not watch this movie. Instead, rent the latest Jerry Bruckheimer flick and enjoy the fireworks.

If however you can understand Night, then definitely watch this movie. You will be in for a treat. Similar as to Signs, Night is evolving both as a writer and a director. Since Unbreakable, his movies have been getting deeper and further away from the simplistic thriller that Sixth Sense was. STORY is becoming the main thing and - nobody can deny this - Night is by far one of the most original writers and one of the most talented directors we have seen in decades. Signs and The Village are a proof of this. Night - once he made enough money to afford it - is distancing himself from Hollywood cliches and is daring something that nobody else dares now: to be ORIGINAL. Yes, it's no longer only in European cinema ...

Village is probably his most daring movie, in the sense that there is no 'real' twist here. The twist can be guessed early on and it is also revealed half-way in the movie. But, here is where a Roger Ebert fails to comprehend it: this movie is not about the twist. It never was - it's all about a GREAT story, storytelling at its best! We are so used with cheap thrills, we forgot what a good story means. We bury ourselves in nonsense and special effects. Mr. Ebert finds Spiderman 2 amazing, but this movie - who dares to be original - is a waste.

I hope Night will still be able to make the movies he likes and I wish him to find the power to ignore critics that never created anything. I am sure his genius has more to show and am looking forward to his next movie.

As for us - do yourself a favour and ignore the bad reviews. Watch this movie for what it is: a truly excellent drama with a completely original story and brilliant ideas!",1105833600,,2063,4.35064935064935
2167616,4,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan's newest piece is being highly criticized as a disappointment by fans of his thrillers.  I must admit I watched this movie in anticipation of a gut wrenching ending that would leave my jaw locked open for hours whilst proclaiming the dark genious of the director.

If you are watching this film with the goal of figuring out the twist, you may very well guess it.  But for those fans of Serling and Hitchcock this feeling is not new.  But rather than criticize what M. Night has failed to do, we should praise what he has succeded in doing.  A very engaging film that is poignant, romantic and as suspensful as any offering by his predecessors.",1105833600,,769,4.536231884057971
2167617,4,B00064LJVO,"In his latest film, The Village, Director M. Night Shyamalan has created yet another chilling thriller with a completely unexpected twist at the end.  This time, the setting appears to be a small, turn of the century village.  We soon learn that this seemingly peaceful community is haunted by mysterious creatures who live in the woods which surround the town; for this reason, the residents never wander outside the limits of the village.  Somehow, however, the villagers are able to keep the monsters at bay and continue with their simple existence.

Things change suddenly when a young mentally handicapped young man (convincingly played by Adrien Brody) seriously injures one of the other residents (Joaquin Phoenix).  The injured man's fiancee, Ivy, a young blind woman (perfectly portrayed by newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard, Ron's daughter) is desperate to save her beloved, and so the village elders--including Ivy's own father--agree not only to let Ivy in on some of the community's secrets but also to allow her to leave the confines of the town in search of medicine.  Ivy's experiences in the woods are reminiscent of The Blair Witch Project, causing the viewer to wonder whether evil forces truly exist or not.  A surprise revealation answers this question, but as in Shyamalan's previous works, the real surprise ending is yet to come.

When I saw this film in the theater, the final moments were truly unexpected, but the DVD version contains deleted scenes with additional clues to the movie's twists.  Other special features on the DVD include a home movie from the director and a diary by Bryce Howard.  Although this is not my favorite Shyamalan film (The Sixth Sense will probably always have that distinction), it is clear that the director has not lost his touch; he truly knows how to connect with his audience and keep them on the edge of their seats.  Definitely recommended for Shyamalan fans as well as anyone who enjoys a subtle, haunting thriller.",1105833600,,1975,5.009174311926605

Let me straighten everything out, so next time you don't write a negative review because you didn't see animals. When we are introduced to Shyamalan's character, a guard, he starts to tell Kevin, the other guard, the stories of the wildlife preserve. IF THEY HAVE MEDICAL SUPPLIES FOR ANIMAL BITES, THEN WE KNOW THEY BELIEVE ANIMALS LIVE THERE, BUT THEY DONT. THE ELDERS PAID THE GOVERNMENT MONEY TO PROHIBIT ANYONE FROM FLYING OVER COVINGTON WOODS. MEANING NO ONE OUTSIDE THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE VILLAGE KNOW WHATS IN THERE. think about it, if the people from the city knew there were people who lived there, they would be curious and check it out, but they don't know any one lives there, THATS WHY KEVIN ACTED SURPRISE WHEN IVY TELLS HIM SHE LIVES IN THE WOODS. THEY ALL BELIEVE ANIMALS LIVE IN THE WOODS, SO THEY NEVER ENTER THEM. MAKES SENSE DOESNT IT?

the movie was great, no one expected the twist, even if they say they did. they're just lying. As M.Night says in the D.V.D., he choose to write the story because the 1890's was an age in which people were confused of what lived in woods. And the story is perfect, the people in the village were confused of what lived in the woods, altough we find out it was all a hoax.",1105833600,,1378,4.446640316205533

Although some have argued that this was not a good movie, I don't think it was as bad as compared to say the recently released ""Darkness"" which is one of the worst movies I have ever seen (avoid at all costs). Anyway, I went into this movie looking for M. Night's plot twist which I guessed pretty early on in the movie. It seemed too me that the characters were forcing their 18-century speak (it was kind've annoying), but now that I think about it that may have been intentional (but who knows) and it helped me guess what the plot twist was (though if you really want to enjoy you may not want avoid doing that). What really was jaw-dropping for me was who gets hurt, how they get hurt and who really is the main character. I thought that was pretty clever. The deeper meaning of the movie is cleverly placed into the plot. The costumes look silly, but again I think (I hope) that was intentional (watch the movie to see what I mean).  Great performances by Howards and Phoenix. Beautifully scored. I would say this is the third best M. Night suspense movie behind the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.",1105833600,,1219,4.384955752212389
2167631,3,B00064LJVO,"""The Village"" is a frustrating movie. On a style level, it is remarkable. The sets, the acting and the photography are first-rate. It's worth seeing for these elements alone. It's the story that's lacking. I won't `ruin' the movie for you, but I will say that the ending is absurd. It's the cinematic equivalent of a comic's long joke ending with a bad punch line.

In rural America around 1900, there is a totally isolated small village. Apparently, it is surrounded on all sides by hostile creatures. The villagers have a truce with these odd beings. Life is idyllic in the town as long as no one ventures into the forest the creatures inhabit. After a couple of young people stray beyond the village's boundaries, all hell breaks loose.

Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt and Adrian Brody are excellent in their roles. They try very hard to bring some meaning to the movie.

In his capacity as a director, M. Night Shyamalan is first-rate as always, but, like ""Signs"". his last movie, it's his screenplay that lets us down because the ending is so implausible. This is not just an intellectual judgment. Both ""The Village"" and ""Signs"" suffered huge declines after great opening weekends in theaters. The people who go to the movies just to be entertained were also disappointed.",1105833600,,1295,4.850678733031674

My guess is he pocketed half of it and the other half went to the unwitting actors who's agents suckered them into this sham of a film.

Short summary of the INCREDIBLY unfeasible plot:  A bunch of people from the city who have had deaths in the family do the logical thing and go live in a wildlife preserve (although we see no animals in it), undetected by authorites , long enough to raise children, whom they traumatize into never leaving the village by dressing in monster suits and other scary tricks.  Anyone ever seen a Scooby-Doo episode?  Then 1 guy stabs another and they send a BLIND girl (with 2 guys we never saw before who wimp out immediately) to go get medicine through the forbidden forest (how she is supposed to acquire multiple-stab wound effective medicine is up to her)..but the 1st guy she meets gets it for her no problem and helps her back over the wall into the park!

2167637,3,B00064LJVO,"I have really enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan's other movies, especially 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Signs'. Each of his movies has a gimmick or payoff, so to speak. It is getting harder and harder to top them, and he must be running low on new ones.
You definitely have to suspend your disbelief in this one. This late nineteenth century Pennsylvania village is sitting in the middle of a not too large pasture, and is surrounded by woods on all four sides. There are 'creatures' living in the woods, the villagers stay out of the woods, and the 'creatures' stay out of the village. That is the 'truce'.
How did the villagers get to there location if these maurading creatures are all around them, and hey, where does all their stuff keep coming from. The land the village occupies is no larger than a cow pasture and cannot be self-sustaining.
But nevermind about all that. The acting is pretty good, especially Joaquim Phoenix. The worst is Adrien Brody, as an over the top halfwit. Director Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard is really good as the blind Ivy.
I suspended my disbelief, and looked forward to the payoff. It is, in my honest opinion, very disappointing. Shyamalan really needs to stop using this 'payoff' or 'gimmick' formula because audiences keep expecting it now and will only be disappointed. It's time for something new.
M. Night Shyamalan is a good storyteller and film maker, and some of his previous movies were brilliant. But it is time to stop with the gimmick payoffs because he just can't keep topping himself anymore. I look forward to Mr. Shyamalan's next film, and hope it is something non-gimmicky.",1105747200,,1630,4.783687943262412

I'm sorry to say that if your idea of cinematic brilliance and achievement is Badder Santa or The Day After Tomorrow, you will indeed be disappointed by The Village. That's because Shyamalan fashions a movie that relies not on fart jokes and explosions, but attempts to provoke thought. And yet, that may be his failing. He asks us to employ our minds and imaginations when we would prefer to be spoon fed vulgarity and unoriginality.

As proven in the past, M. Night is able to do more with sound, lighting, mood, and acting, than most Hollywood hacks are able to do with $200 million budgets.  However, there does remain one over-arching complaint that must be dealt with - the twist ending.  I mean come on, I saw it coming a mile away. But. . . of course I saw it coming, because PEOPLE, the movie aint about the twist ending.  Rather, it probes subjects such as innocence, love, our deep-seated desire for community, our attempts to escape all pain, and the heavenly idea of utopia. While at the same time asking questions such as, what price are we willing to pay for safety?, and regardless of how much we isolate ourselves, can we ever escape the evil that resides in the heart of man?

So, everybody desiring to hear Will Smith crack another beautifully timed zinger, or see Hillary Duff turned from ugly duckling to beauty queen, or hear Chris Rock say ""doody,"" look elsewhere.

I'm a big fan of M. Night's work...there is some quality that his movies possess that, even though they aren't action-packed, still keep you glued to your seat, and hold your interest. His stories slowly unfold, telling wonderful stories. The Village is no different.

There were, of course, the few ""BOO!"" moments throughout, but that's to be expected. I'll admit that I jumped more than once. But if you're going to watch this movie (which I highly recommend) then watch it for the right reasons: It's story is, in a word, superb. Gripping. Romantic. Enthralling. And, not to mention, the music is beautiful.

I won't bother writing a summary, as I'd rather you watch for yourself, or scroll up and read Amazon's little review. Despite M. Night using his signature style, rest assured that this new peice of work is very original.

2167644,4,B00064LJVO,"In THE VILLAGE, the people in a small, rural Pennsylvania town of yesteryear have a pact with creatures who live in the woods surrounding the village. The townspeople stay out of the woods and the creatures stay out of the village. But then the creatures begin appearing in the village. No one knows why. Strange and unusual events occur more frequently until an attempted murder is made upon one of the village's most promising future leaders, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix). In order to save the young man's life, the pact must be broken. A young woman risks everything to save Lucius' life and protect the village.

The acting is full of emotion, yet restrained; realistic and not melodramatic. I especially found the performances of Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy Walker and Joaquin Phoenix as Lucius Hunt to be especially rewarding. As a bonus the film also has Adrien Brody playing a mentally challenged and psychopathic young man named Noah Percy.

Shyamalan's direction of the images, light, and sound in the movie is first rate. There aren't many directors who can or are willing to get as much depth and emotion from one sound or image as Shyamalan can. A single sound (such as a howl in the woods) or a single image (a figured cloaked in red) creates more of a suspense and chill than any expensive special effect could. Shyamalan has definitely learned from Hitchcock, the person who his work owes the most to. The human imagination is so much more powerful than what can be shown on the screen.

There are many who have complained about the seeming let down of the ""twists"" in THE VILLAGE. I figured out one of the main twists less than 15 minutes into the movie. Yet, even though I knew what was going to happen, my enjoyment of the movie wasn't lessened at all. In fact, my appreciation for the film increased. THE VILLAGE really isn't a scary film at all, and nor should it be classified as a thriller. Instead, it's a love story and one of the best love stories I've watched in a long time. The love that is shared between Lucius and Ivy is a love that is strong, purposeful, and realistic. In our modern world, we've grown shallow in our ideas of love and even in how we actually love other people. THE VILLAGE is a testament to real love. It shows us what it really means to love another person. In the postmodern, fast food, supersized, commercialized culture in which we live, everything is about me. Love really has very little to do with me, but has everything to do with the other person. That's something we need to hear more and more often. Our hearts have been hijacked and it's time we get them back.

I really enjoyed THE VILLAGE. It's one of the best love stories to come out in a long time. Not only that, but there are a ton of religious and spiritual messages scattered throughout the film. A person could even watch THE VILLAGE as a religious allegory full of Biblical allusions. I'm not sure what Shyamalan's faith is, but I do know that he is making some of the most powerful religious movies today. After tackling the issues of accepting one's identity in THE SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE, exploring the nature of faith in SIGNS, and now examining charity and hope in THE VILLAGE, I am quite curious to see what Christian virtue Shyamalan delves into next.

This DVD edition of THE VILLAGE includes several deleted scenes, a couple of featurettes--including a home movie taken my M. Night Shyamalan, and production photos. I enjoyed watching the featurettes. They augmented my appreciation of the film's artistry.",1105660800,,3544,4.664

2167646,4,B00064LJVO,"Reviewing an M. Night Shyamalan movie is difficult because he relies on the surprise more than most directors and I hate taking anything enjoyable away from a movie.  Let me say this about ""The Village"", while there are surprises in the movie, you will likely see them coming a mile away.

But the ""shockers"" are not the real point of this movie at all.  It has a soft and poetic soul.  While it seems to want you to think about it at some deeper level, my advice is do not.  The whole premise of the thing will fall to pieces if you get much below the surfaces and treating the story as a wistful romance.

Now, if being fooled like you were in ""Sixth Sense"" is what you are after, this movie really will not do it.  Nor is it as powerful or as funny as ""Signs"".  However, I think it is more lovely than ""Unbreakable"", but similar it tone.

It is definitely worth seeing and all the actors do fine work. I was especially taken with Bryce Dallas Howard.  Her performance is powerful and is the light of the movie.

The extras on the disk are quite interesting in how the movie was made.  Shyamalan really does go all out to create the world in which his movie exists.  And I enjoyed his discussion of how he relies on sound to create so much of the mood in his movies.",1105660800,4,1268,4.211618257261411

You're not there for the twist per se--you're there for the ride.

I really enjoyed this movie, and unlike the idiots behind me in the theater who whined about the ending, so far as I was concerned the abruptness and the ""lack of closure"" weren't a problem. The story ends when it does because everything that's really important has been addressed. Whether or not the wounded boy lives or dies is--well, not necessarily irrelevant, but insignificant to the grand scheme of the tale. Does anyone really care that Little Red Riding Hood's grandma lives or dies (depending on the version of the fable)? Not so much. The story is not about the wounded/ailing character's recovery--the story is about her journey.

There aren't really that many scary things about this film. However, if you walk into it expecting quality drama, acting and storytelling, you might just find something likable about it.

M. Night Shyamalan (director of ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and ""Signs,"") brings us an intriguing period piece about love, jealousy, and how far people are willing to go when driven by fear.

An ""Amish"" type community resides in an isolated village surrounded by a forest with a dark history. They fear ""those they do not speak of"" who dwell in the woods, and dare not cross their path. But when a dire need of medicine from the towns beyond the woods emerges, one blind woman dares to face the dark in order to bring back the light.

The film has an interesting (and creepy) atmosphere to it - a characteristic few movies these days are able to accomplish. One particular shot that comes to mind is between the two main characters, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) and the blind woman Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard), when they're talking on the porch. It's a close-up profile shot of them talking, and in between their faces you see a grey fog covering the vast field in front of them - making the audience wonder what's out there watching them. It really symbolizes that not everything may be as it seems.

The performances given by William Hurt(AI: Artificial Intelligence), Bryce Dallas Howard, and Joaquin Phoenix really make this film stand on firm ground. But perhaps the most interesting character is that of Noah Percy, played by Adrien Brody (The Pianist). He plays a mentally-challenged, and sometimes unstable man who happens to be in love with Ivy Walker. When he finds out that she's in love with Lucius Hunt, his unstable characteristics really start to take hold of him (as well as creep out the audience).

If this were the first film from Shyamalan, it would be critically acclaimed. But since this is his fourth major film, and Shyamalan is now known for putting plot twists in his stories, people go into it immediately starting to second-guess everything they observe. So many people would probably figure out the twist long before the film ends because they're already looking for it. Either that, or they spend the whole film waiting in anticipation for it, only to be let down because they built it up to be the Second Coming. They remember how cool it was to discover what really happened to Bruce Willis' character in ""The Sixth Sense."" But they forget that, at that time, they had never seen a film quite like it before. They had no preconceived notions or expectations.

As much as I enjoyed ""The Village,"" I think Shyamalan should stop making films with plot twists for a while and just make some good movies with good stories. And he should not hype it up by advertising it as ""An M. Night Shyamalan Film."" That name is now immediately connected with plot twists and thillers whenever someone sees it. Otherwise, he may very well come to be known as ""M. Night Shyamalamadingdong.""

The DVD has some cool features. I didn't find the deleted scenes themselves to be all that interesting, but I liked Shyamalan's commentaries on why they were cut from the film. Bryce Dallas Howard's diary was an interesting feature. For four minutes, we're given her perspective on what it was like filming the movie. We're also given behind-the-scenes featurettes (with the option of playing them all at once) that give us an interesting look at the production of the film. Also included are some production stills, as well as an amusing old home video movie Shyamalan did when he was young that looks strikingly similar to that of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Highly enjoyable.

The silver lining to this travesty was I was able to get a free rental from a kind video store clerk who also saw ""The Villiage"" and felt sorry for me.

I'd recommend renting or watching this film on cable, but I would only buy it if were collecting Shyamalan's films or were a big fan of one of the stars. The film started out well enough, but became somewhat predictable. Sure the 'twist' at the end was interesting, but less remarkable than those from MNS's previous works. Overall, I'd say The Village is a watchable film...3-3.5 stars",1105660800,,557,4.524752475247524

It sounds like something out of a fairytale, with an enchanted forest in all.  The build up was ok but the monsters looked like something out a of low budget high schooler's english project.  The movie was way too slow.  I couldn't  understand what year it was supposed to be because in their little village they were stuck in the 1800's but when Ivy got to the outside, the rest of the world was in 2000 something.  I recommend watching something else.  Anything else.",1105660800,3,642,4.4655172413793105
2167652,4,B00064LJVO,"Another of M. Night Shyamalan's unique, and, in some cases, terrifyingly realistic films, The Village, which for some strange reason was marketed as a horror film, is far more at home in the drama genre. That's not to say that the film is free of Shyamalan's knack for suspense and fear, because it most certainly is not, but it is also not your standard ""villagers fight off the monsters"" film either. At first glance, the film plays with your emotions, you either like it, or you utterly hate it, but in the end, with it's nice, romantic conclusion that, like most of Shyamalan's endings, seems to emphasize a return to normalcy as well as the importance of family, faith, and tradition, it leaves you in a sort of soft middle-ground. Its plot is airtight, with a definite air of immediate and historical, (for the bulk of the film,) realism; it is a masterwork, but if you're expecting a film along the lines of Exorcist or Hellboy, be prepared to face some pretty serious disappointment.

 In all, it's a definite must-see. Few film makers are better than M. Night Shyamalan at making such a touching blend of family values and close-to-home horror, and the acting is incredible. William Hurt, Joaquin Phoenix, Judy Greer, and yes, even Sigourney Weaver deliver a performance that is beyond incredible, accented by the seemingly trademark appearance of the director himself. In a sense, there's little more than praise that can be spoken about this movie, and it makes an excellent addition to the list of films that Director M. Night Shyamalan is so famous for. This film stands on its own, apart from any other that has come before, and is likely to give any other such original films a run for their money.",1105574400,3,1713,4.74496644295302
2167653,5,B00064LJVO,"This is a different type of film.  Half way through it was a 3 star flick but I slowly changed my mind.  There are boogiemen in the woods.  The villagers are trapped in the village by their fears and that is what this film is about-- Fear.  Its about how people react and treat their fears and what they're afraid of.  Colors are used as symbols and ultimately the town elders are faced with what they fear the most-- the monsters in the red hoods.  The elders try as they might to hide from the red monsters are faced with them.........

The village lives innocently, just as you would imagine quakers living.  The film is about their innocence too and whether it is really possible to stay innocent when isolated.  Unfortunately the villagers must remain isolated or be faced with the monsters they fear.  To travel to another town would mean going through the woods which is their domain........

Like I said, the film is different.  If you are looking for an action flick, skip this one.  If you appreciate things of a poetic nature, this would be your type of film.",1105574400,3,1070,4.510416666666667
2167654,3,B00064LJVO,"There comes a time when a filmmaker might not reach for that intelligent and surprising move in a film that he is known for, and instead will let the wind blow out of his sails and create an ending that will have many scratching their heads and wondering what it was all about. Meaning, that M. Night Shyamalan, who thus far has done no wrong with this viewer, may of gotten the praise and attention of his surprise ""twist"" endings to his head and thought that he could throw any half hearted twist our way and it will be boughten. Such is the case with this movie. The movie actually works better without the so called 'twist' ending, which is mildly amusing, but is so out of left field, even by Shyamalan standards, that it leaves you with a ""that's it?!"" feeling. It is way below his normal ending standards, but the movie up to it works pretty well. Written and directed once again by the man, the trailers and previews for the film may of lead viewers to think it is something else. The movie is not really a scary thriller. It is more of a romantic, period piece, love story. With strange creatures thrown into the mix. What the film has to it's advantage is a supremely superb cast. William Hurt is Edward Walker, the leader of a small village named Covington, who presides over his quaint village that is set around ominous woods. Taking place in the late 1800's, the people of the village lead a simple, closed off from anything, or anyone, life. But all is not serene. There lives scary creatures that lurk in the woods that surround the town. The villagers try to make peace and try to live in harmony, but things will set the fierce creatures off. Mainly, the color red. A color that is so feared, that any sign of it in the village, like a flower or berries, must be immediatley removed and buried. Notice the color of the creatures' robes. Walker's daughter Ivy, wonderfully played by Ron Howard's daughter Bryce Dallas Howard, is a lovely and blind young woman who falls for Lucious Hunt, the quiet and somewhat odd son of Alice Hunt(who is played by Sigourney Weaver). Lucius himself is played by Joaquin Phoenix. See, I said it had a stellar cast!. When tragedies occur, the story shifts from Phoenix and it solely becomes Howard's movie. Her character must make a decision for her one and only love. Oscar winner Adrien Brody also stars in the film as the village idiot, a role that he is excellent in, but many may wonder why he chose a supporting role with virtually no lines after winning the Oscar. Like all of his films, Shyamalan gets a great cast, and he uses them to the fullest, even if not all of them in this movie(sad to say)get much attention. Shyamalan is definitley a a fine storyteller and filmmaker. Even when the movies aren't also hitting on all cylinders, they are still fine pieces of craftsmanship that are done like no other director today. He has a keen eye, and a superb sense of direction of choreography. He films every scene to it's fullest potential, and always makes the most of the scene and the surroundings it's in. Like all of his movies, Shyamalan's work is an acquired taste. Not all get it. Not all appreciate it. But even at his weakest, which this film is, he is still very interesting and creates a masterful show. At the end of the day, the story drags a bit with very little in the way of scares, but it is a beautiful looking movie, with strong performances, that is slightly tampered with the ending. Weak Shyamalan is still better than most everything out there.",1105574400,2,3526,4.5109375

The reason people rate the movie badly is that most of the people who see it either expect it to be a scary movie, which it is not, or they see that it is a Shyamalan film and expect it to have an extremely shocking twist.  However, this movie is all about the concept and story, and it offers small twists throughout.  The major twist is guessable, but the way Shyamalan does it, it's like he wants you to figure it out.  One of the main reasons the film is so good is it is full of emotion.  All of the members of the cast do an amazing job, and the soundtrack is one of the best I have heard, with beautiful melodies and haunting sounds.  So to anyone who wants to see it, if you want to see a scary movie, don't see it.  However, if you want to see an amazingly good movie with a few chills and a great story, watch it.

It's amazing how he makes you become one with the character as you watch... I truly felt Ivy's fear as she was alone and lost in the woods.  The acting is fantastic, the people are real.  Some of the lines are a little unnatural, but rather than being an error on the writers' part I think it gives you an idea of how people in their situation would act... after all they are playing the part of someone they are not, so why would we expect it to sound perfectly natural?  The acting is fabulous... Bryce Dallas Howard is adorable and develops her character remarkably well.  Joaquin Phoenix is a cutie.  The parts of some of the elders are also well developed.  I am a particuar fan of Cherry Jones who also appeared in Signs as Caroleen the cop.  Overall, don't miss this one.  You won't be disappointed!",1105574400,,955,4.436781609195402

My problem is not that the movie is not scary, neither violent. A good movie doesnt need to be scarey to be good. I have problems to see what makes all these elements fits into one movie, I just dun see why is necessary to unfold that the village is actually an isolated area from the modern society and everyone inside are escapers from their normal life for their own reasons. Afterall 80% of story is about base on the perspective of this blinded girl to unfold the story between the village and this unknown monster out there. But at the end it comes in the other truth about the village is everyone who lives there are escapers from normal modern life. My problem is, this part of the truth dun emotionally line up with the main plot. It felt like the reason they must live a life like people from the past is pretty nonsense. Well, of course Shyamalan got his answer on this one, because the town people were all escaping the theri normal life and so then they created this iconic hilious creature to remind everyone about their ugly past, and which accidently created this unfortunate event, besides the monster outside town is symbolizing their fear of the outside world. OK I got it, and I'm not saying it isn't smart, all I'm critizing is teh materials isn't quite balanced and so you feel more  a lost at the ending than a decent surprise when the truth unfold at the end.

It bored me.  It couldn't make up its' mind as to whether or not it was a character study, (though it never stayed with any one character, with the possible exception of blind Ivy impossibly traipsing through the woods, for long), a horror movie or a romance, so all parts were muddled.  It wasn't in the least bit frightening.  And unfortunately, the twist this time is just transparent.

I felt badly for 2 of my favorite actors, Joaquin and Oscar-winner Adrian Brody.  Joaquin's character Lucius had little more to do but hold hands with Ivy, look befuddled and grunt occasionally.  And Noah Percy, Adrian's character, was the village idiot with a violent streak who was more aware of what was really going on than any of them.

The acting was crappy all the way through the movie (especially Ron Howards daughter she has to be disposed of from an acting carreer), and you will shorely notice a ton of mistakes throughout the movie as I did which is quite dissapointing for Shyamalan regarding his ability to release some really good titles such as 'The sixth sense' and 'signs'.

The worst part i have seen joaquin play in history i think the movie could have knocked him down a few spots in rank. I can see that the movie has been built so you have no idea of the twist that is about to come.

2167664,2,B00064LJVO,"I had meant to see ""The Village"" over this past summer but it was one of the few films that I just didn't get the time and energy to seeing. There were other films that I simply felt were far more compelling. I was right. I recently screened the widescreen dvd version of ""The Village"" and I have to say that I'm glad that I did not pay my hard earned money to the film.

The premise of the film is on a farm community in Pennsylvania in the 19th century. Almost amish-like except that there are large, dangerous entities in the woods that no one want to cross paths. The community and these creatures have an understanding that each party stays within their boundaries.

The cast consists some of the best method actors in Hollywood from the past couple of decades including William Hurt as Edward Walker, Sigourney Weaver as Alice Hunt, and Adrian Brody as the intectually-challenged Noah. This film is also the debut of Ron Howard's daughter Bryce as the heroine Ivy Walker, the younger daughter of Edward Walker. Her love intest is Luctius Hunt played by Joaqin Phoenix. Everyone in the cast except for Joaqin put in convincing performances. I felt that Joaqin's acting in this film was rather stiff and lifeless.

The film starts off on the right foot. The suspense of the idea that there were monsters in the woods was convincing. The combination of the cinematography and film score was what really made the film suspenseful and intense as it was. Unfortunately the film begins a slow descent into cinematic purgatory every time I saw Joaqin in the scene. Bryce on the other hand was a real delight as the independent Ivy. Despite being blind, Ivy was not your weak, damsel in distress. She knew how to take care of herself and did not rely on those around her.

What I did like in the film was that the scenes with the creatures from the woods were very limited. Not showing them a whole lot in the beginning of the film was a great strategy by M. Night Shymalan. I have to admit that this film did get my blood pumping and gave me goosebumps with the idea that the creatures wanted to kill the villagers. M. Night Shymalan definitely has a knack for cinematography. I also loved the film score which gave the film an eery atmosphere. I don't think it would have been as suspenseful without the music.

What I didn't like about the film is: A) Joaqin Phoenix's horrible acting skills. His late brother River Phoenix was a great actor. Joaqin is not. Major miscast. B) The slow pace of the film. There were moments of the film when I thought it was simply about an 19th century farming community. C) The second half of the film. That was just a lame idea. I didn't like the idea of that humans are their own worst enemy concept. That was really pretentious and totally ruined the film for me.

The bonus dvd features were far more interesting than most of this film. I loved watching how the film was literally constructed. It's too bad the film itself was a big pretentious mess but then again I always felt that M. Night's films were big, pretentious, overrated cinematic POS.

I don't necessarily hate this film as much as a lot of critics and movie fans. After all, nothing can be as horrid as ""Carnage"" or ""The Stepford Wives"" remake. The premise of ""The Village"" was good but it was terribly executed. The second half of the film totally ruined the entire film experience for me. Oh well, the dvd features makes up for the horrid second half which is why I am giving this film 2 stars instead of 1.",1105574400,6,3511,4.493730407523511
2167665,1,B00064LJVO,"M. is a hack, a second-place magician in a high school talent show.  He's drawn comparisons to Hitchcock and Spielberg - in the same sentence no less?  Resting on the laurels of exactly ONE good movie, he manages to eek out a career for himself.  Since THE SIXTH SENSE, his movies have gotten progressively worse.  UNBREAKABLE was fair at best.  An interesting idea with a dull, rumbling ride to the conclusion.  SIGNS was a very rough movie to watch.  The characters were cookie-cutter samples of human emotion and conflict - toss in a guy in an alien suit and you have what exactly?  A bad joke.  Now, THE VILLAGE...

Mr. Shyamalan's ""entertainments"" are about as mediocre as you can get - and I really do wish I could enjoy his movies.  They seem to lack something.  Walking out of this one, I felt like I had just witnessed a badly executed parlor trick disguised as a vague ""social commentary"" piece.  Bryce Howard is a wonderful actress; I hope to see more of her in the future.  She takes a lifeless character and gives her depth.  The other cast members also played their parts wonderfully - too bad it wasn't another movie.  The trailer seemed creepy; a dark fairytale or ghost story set in the 19th century.  Nice idea, haven't seen one of those in a while.  I pay the eight bucks, and watched this thing unfold:

THE VILLAGE had absolutely no suspense, no tension - a few cheap scares along the way - but nothing to make the ""trick"" ending worth the ride.  I won't give it away for those who haven't seen the movie, but the whole story is so flat and badly contrived, that it doesn't really matter.  The pay off was in the vein of the ""Twilight Zone"" & when it was revealed, I could almost hear the squeaky curtain and see the wizard furiously working the controls to an out-of-control smoke machine.  I'm not looking for depth or stories that cleverly draw an allegory of our world every time I go to the movies, but would like something above... this?  Pretty cinematography, composition and cheap thrills do NOT make good movies - that would be like having a handsome nose with loose teeth and no eyeballs.

I read a review that stated this movie was ""smart... an intelligent thrill-ride"".  No it wasn't - it was awful rubbish.  And reading some of the other reviews here, I get the impression they'd enjoy watching chocolate balls melt in their hand... or it's completely possible I saw another movie with the same title and premise?

2167670,4,B00064LJVO,"I have already written a review on my thoughts on this film but just wanted to add that this IS classic film making not a superfical action or monster film.

Sure M.Night is a ego manaic who really enjoys making what he believes to be masterpiece's and is probabely a tyrant to work with but the man does deliever old style story - telling, film -making and adds a few modern twists.

In other words, the man does deliever different and classic films in the tradition of the old film makers like Alferd Hitchcock.

I studied the movies and life of Hitchcock when i was in university and M.Night himself realtes Mr Hitch as one of his favourtite directors. There is a clear connection to the two

However, M.Night has he own style and man, can he add emotions to even the simplest scenes. His movies tend to make me cry like a baby and i'm not a cryer.

And for &8&8 sake can people stop relating everything to The Sixth Sense. I mean it prob one of his best films and certainly touched a larger auidence but the guy does have more to offer than this and its a tad unfair to always compare every movie he makes to that one really but him on the map. When we live in a world of fast, cellioud, popcorn movies, it is both re-freshing and important to embrace films that have directors who can make different, thought provoking films that actually make you think and question - not just eye candy for the eyes.

Granted his films ARE slow moving, they CAN tend to make people question some of his logic, they CAN even bore people to tears but man, can he write a story that you both think and talk about for days after. He is a story teller first and film maker second and has demonstrated 4 times now that he can deliver on both.

Six Sense was a introduction really to M.Night (yes i know he made two films prior but im talking about the commerical films only). UnBreakable was never going to live up to the 6th Sense but still delivers a interesting, fasinating story that held me to the end with a conclusion that was so obvious but yet not expected by me. Signs was a major commerical hit and once again deliver a fine story that was excuted in a way that just oozed emotion and interest for any viewer who likes a good story and film-making. Lastly The Village provides another great tale with brooding emotion. M.Night likes to make a set/or the environments isolated i have found and we tend to focus in all his movies on a very claustphobic environment that just sucks the intellegent viewer in.

I have come to realise that people always concertrate on the suspense, horror and twists of a M.Night film and maybe thats why some find them slow and boring. But what the man SHOULD be awarded for is his ability to create a great emotional drama. I truely believe this man can film a person standing in a field and induce so much emtion somehow from the scene that it makes yah eyes tear up. M.Night is a serious film maker who develops emotional stories first and adds the supernatural elements second.

As far as i am concerned he is a modern day filmaker using old style filmamking in the tradition of Hitchcock and his films stand out from the wham, bam movies of today. The films are about story and emotion not effects or explosions.

Pesonally, in real life, the man would prob drive me nuts with his ego and need to write , direct,act and gloat over his films but i respect him for his clear talent in film making and ability to make a film that stands out in a Western Culture and his sheer passion towards making his films.

In regards to The Village, i say this.....a brillant film that moves slowly but constintely and will hold for those who appriectate a good tale with dramatic flair.

And as i said in my movie review....THIS ISNT A MONSTER FILM, TIS A DRAMATIC PIECE WITH A SUPERNATURAL FEEL.....so if u want a monster film that will scare the pants off you this aint it. But if u want creepy, spooky and at times damn sad then this is for you.

While Kill Bill - 2 managed to fool audiences with the hysteria created by Kill Bill - 1 ""The Village"" got the well-deserved boot from the theaters and I hope it lost a lot of money and hope M Night goes totally bankrupt and disappears into the night where he takes movie making lessons in a secret village somewhere.",1105488000,11,1483,4.66412213740458
2167674,1,B00064LJVO,"Thriller or not, this is just a plain bad movie.  Like Signs, it is hard to appreciate the acting or characterization when the plot is nonsensical and downright insulting.

2167675,4,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan is in a way my kind of director: he writes and directs stories that I'm actually interested in. Unlike other films that have stories that I like after I see it, Shyamalan always writes stories that are up my alley and being a big X-Files fan, those stories deal with paranormal stuff. After the rebound success of Signs from the underperforming-but-underrated Unbreakable, we have the Village which boasts a stellar cast, an intriguing premise but several mistteps that make it less than what it should've been.

Late 19th century Pennsylvania(it's a given since all his films are based there), there exists a quiet little village that's cut off from everyone else. That's because there exists creatures known as Those We Don't Speak Of and the village has a truce: don't come into our woods, we won't go into your towns. Well some people get restless and need to go outside to fetch medicines but they find out so they start entering the towns and causing panic.

Unbreakable felt like a serious stab at creating full characters rather than relying on just shocks and scares so with the Village it feels like a love story at times. One villager loves another but he's in love with her sister who also has feelings for him and his mother has an attraction to the girl's father. Mind you, this ain't incest, far from it, but you're like ""wow, lot of loving in this village"". Casting is excellent with tons of theatre actors and either Oscar, Emmy or Tony winning/nominated actors and they give the film an added credibility. The real find though is Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard, who despite questionable blindness acting, is quite a watch and shows a depth. The one misfire and this is not the actor's fault is the village idiot, literally, played by Adrien Brody. Granted Brody does what he can but his role just takes away some of the film. One scene the villagers hear eerie howling sounds from the woods and are unsettled...until the tension's broken when Brody starts laughing in a ""yay, monsters!"" way. Had he been cast as a different character altogether, it would've been better.

Now for the creatures themselves. While onscreen a bit more in full view than I would've liked, they do have an otherwordly ""don't mess with us"" feeling but there's 2 faults: one there's not enough. They're not given that much screen time to give the film the dramatic urgency it should and 2) a major revelation concerning the nature of these beasts comes BEFORE a showdown between Bryce's blind Ivy character and the creature. This revelation completely robs what was supposed to be, and kind of is, a suspenseful scene. The first twist ending(obviously no spoilers here)I figured out halfway through and was kind of spoiled beforehand and most likely you will figure it out too but the second caught me off guard since I thought they're was only 1 twists, but nope 2.

While it's got its missteps, you should rent it anyways to have a nice scare now and then.",1105488000,,2983,4.7528957528957525
2167676,3,B00064LJVO,"If you go into this film expecting 'Sixth Sense' type horror, you will be dissappointed.  This falls short of the suspense/surprise we come to expect from M. Night and most of you will guess the ending well before it arrives.

Taking place in the 1800s, the premise of this story revolves around a village the is surrounded by something evil (spirits?). They have a sort-of arrangment with each other, but eventually the village characters want out.  The attempts at suspense and frightening the audience ensue from there.

The special features on the DVD are nice, including the a ""making of"" feature and some deleted scenes.  The commentary is also interesting as M. Night expalins what he was shooting for in the scenes.

This movie makes a nice rental, but it is not worth buying as you will probably not watch it more than once. 2.5 stars rounded up to 3.",1105488000,2,860,4.7
2167677,3,B00064LJVO,"The Village is an evolution, of sorts, for the M. Night Shyamalan formula. Instead of focusing on one protagonist as he has done in his previous films, he has shifted the focus to an ensemble drama. It is also his first period drama in which the fantastical elements are brought into question. It was also his first commercial failure. After a strong opening weekend and a critical response that ranged from indifference to hostility, the film disappeared quickly from theatres. Now that all the dust has settled, The Village deserves another look.

Deconstructing The Village"" is a 25-minute featurette on the making of M. Night's movie. This extra explores various aspects of the production, from casting to editing and sound. For standard press kit material it is refreshingly substantial.

There are four deleted scenes introduced by M. Night. He puts them in context and explains why he ultimately cut them from the film.

""Bryce's Diary"" features the young actress reading from her diary that she kept while making the movie. It mostly involves her gushing about her co-stars and working on a big-time Hollywood movie.

""M. Night's Home Movie"" continues a tradition with his DVDs of including one of the short films he made as a kid. This one is a cute recreation of the famous opening scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark with M. Night playing Indiana Jones.

Finally, there is a gallery of 38 behind-the-scenes photos of M. Night working with his actors.

Ultimately, traditional horror film fans will feel cheated by the last third of The Village. It betrays its initial supernatural inclinations in favour of M. Night's trademark humanistic message: that we are our own worst enemy. The problem with this film and with all of his films is that there are very little gray areas. There is either good or bad people. At first, the villagers seem to have many gray areas but by the end of the film it is back to good and bad. It's too bad because somewhere in The Village there is a good film trying to get out and if M. Night would only loosen up thematically he might make a truly great movie.",1105488000,2,2099,4.736986301369863
2167678,2,B00064LJVO,"That's about it... this was perhaps a made-for-tv-movie at best that somehow either got rejected by the networks, or was forced onto the screen by corporate pressure.

It starts of decent enough, and gets you hooked for the first 30 minutes, however after that, it's downhill, predictable and full of too many questions and confusions to be worth it.  Some questions (which will not give away the silly ending) You mean this is the FIRST time that someone in this village was in desperate need of medical attention?  If they are limited to living within the clearing from the woods, how do they get more wood and firewood?  If we are to believe that actual monsters roam the woods and are THAT much of a threat, why are the watchmen teenage boys at best?  A village of at least 20-30 males who have axes, clubs and other weapons at their disposal, against what, a few porcupine looking pig-monsters, and they haven't killed the monsters yet!?  An entire town talks day and night about ""The things which cannot be mentioned or talked about."", oh yeah, that's got me on the edge of my seat.

Interesting idea, but extrememly poorly presented.  And what happened during the last 30 minutes? Did someone finally realize they were running out of film and shouted out..""Let's end this thing... dinner is ready!""  If you are going to give away the ending of the film, why do it with 40 minutes left in the film?  Now we are forced to sit and wait for a climatic ending... which never comes.

The acting was poor because the entire village all had the same acting script;  Everyone beahves lethargic and polite and act like the guy standing next to you.

The best part of this movie was when you actually thought there were monsters coming after them, that took up 5 minutes tops in this movie.

I think its great drama, but I was fully prepared to be scared immensely, and I was at about the 30 minute mark. However, from there on, things  change.

If you approach this excellent DVD ( With great 5.1. sound) with an open mind, then it is a great watch. William Hurt is great. And the ""debut"" actress is impressive, but suitably forgettable ( since the key players all shine based on her performance). In fact, she is built up as the centre-piece of the film in more ways than one.

I did enjoy Night's cameo  ... quite fun I think. Anyways, if you view it as a good drama, or just as a good film to watch, and don't bring the baggage of the previous  films, then you will definitely  enjoy a very tense, and beautifully  atmospheric film.",1105488000,4,809,4.311258278145695
2167680,2,B00064LJVO,"The Village was one of those films that I was busting to see when it hit theaters. However, one thing or another got in the way. So I managed to secure it for the first day of its DVD release. Was I disappointed!

The majority of the film is a very spooky set up that has some of the elements of the very creepy British horror film, ""Blood on Satan's Claw"". Unfortunately, Shyamalan is now known for his Barnum-esque cheap tricks, so you can't fully buy in to what is presented.

The premise is that this remote village set sometime in the early 1800's or late 1700's is beseiged by creepy creatures who live in the woods. They provide offerings to the creatures to keep them at bay. The creatures are truly creepy, but never moreso than when seen as they quickly glide across the corner of the screen.

In the midst of this is a little love story going on between Dallas Howard (little Ronnie ""Opie Taylor"" Howard's daughter) and Joaquin Phoenix.

Phoenix is amazingly good and still surprises me that he is as good, if not better than anything his now deceased brother was doing. Dallas Howard is also something of a great find. John Hurt and Cherry Jones (a Shyamalan regular) are also quite good.

The problem comes in the guise of the director himself and the audience's expectations.

You see, we've all seen the Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs. We know that we are being set up for some sort of a weird twist in the final reel. It's Shyamalan's formula. It's also typical for the old Twilight Zone show and any number of cheap thrillers. Sixth Sense was a really effective movie, because no director/writer had gone down that path in quite a while. But if you keep delivering the same formula (as Shy has done), then there's no surprise and nothing new. It becomes formulaic. Think about when the movie ""Scream"" first came out. It was considered brilliant for delivering a good thriller, but also for poking fun at horror movies, sequels, itself and society in general. Then it became the butt of its own jokes and the genre imploded. Shyamalan created his own thriller genre which was not necessary. It may get a few warm bodies in the seats, but as is evidenced by his boxoffice, it can't maintain the momentum that the first film achieved.

Since it's Shyamalan, you start looking for where the McGuffin is. For me it was the variety of hat styles worn by the men that tipped me off that we were either on a different planet or that what time period we were supposed to be seeing wasn't really what we were seeing.

Anyway, it's a decent enough film for relatively mindless viewing, but don't expect it to be a water cooler type of film.",1105488000,4,2651,4.531380753138075
2167681,4,B00064LJVO,"What is it that has so many people conflicted about THE VILLAGE? Is it that the movie was bad? Poorly done? A disappointment? I don't think so.

In my opinion, the negative reviews being thrown around for THE VILLAGE are less about the effectiveness of the movie and its execution, and more about the fact that M. Night Shyamalan is sort of a victim of his own past.  Everyone knows to expect a twist. Based on his previous movies, you know that there is going to be a surprising ending. So, you basically sit down and know to be on the look out for what that surprise is.

Has THE VILLAGE been M. Night Shyamalan's first movie... I believe it would have received similar accolades as THE SIXTH SENSE.

It is a good movie, for a lot of reasons, but it's certainly not without its faults.

The highlight of the film in my book, and for any movie, for that matter, is the lead character... Ivy Walker, played by BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD. The key to any good film is a sympathetic lead character that you can get behind and feel for, hope for and root for. Bryce Howard pulls this off wonderfully.

This... to me, is the saving grace of the film.

Ivy Walker is a young blind girl, innocent, good-natured, in love and searching for someone to guide her through her life without sight. She is member of a small village that is kept from traveling outside their borders by a band of creatures that inhabit the woods. The rules are many and the creatures aren't tolerant of anyone who breaks them.

I won't talk to much about the details of the movie... there is a thin line of explanation that would ruin it for those who haven't seen it yet. But, I will say that the suspense is good. There are shocks. The characters are relateable and sympathetic.

Yet, there are problems with THE VILLAGE. The finale, although good and surprising, has some holes in it.

My biggest problem was with the final encounter that Ivy has with the creature in the woods. Not the encounter itself, but the creature. I would have found it much easier to believe the creature and why it attacked her had it played out differently. There was another angle that M. Night Shyamalan could have taken to make it much more believeable.

This is a weird review to write, because I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't seen. Yet, I enjoyed THE VILLAGE when I went to see it. In fact, It is one of my favorites of Shyamalan's.

I like character driven movies. I like movies that build good character and then build suspense, thrills and action on top of that. Because without good character, NO MOVIE WORKS FOR ME.

Check out THE VILLAGE. Rent before buying. If anything, it is certainly a brain twister type movie that reminds us of the days when simple little stories like Alfred Hitchcock Presents and The Twilight Zone were the talk of the town.",1105488000,5,2815,4.4639376218323585
2167682,3,B00064LJVO,"My hat's off to M. Night for sticking to his minimalist guns and trying... with every film he writes and directs, he TRIES...

What I like about his films is how he lays the pieces of a puzzle for you and forces you to interact.  (unless you like films like ""Dude, where's my Car?"" in which case, there's no hope for you)  He takes the story conventions and constructs his own frankenstein monster.

But like the monster itself, he leaves details and plot lines un-mended hoping you won't take a second look.  Night is a talented individual who's best is still to come and in time I hope he relies less on smoke and mirrors.

He's a good shooter and man can he inject heart in his films..  imagine what he can do with a tighter plot?

It is a straightforward thriller. It is hopelessly confusing. Those who don't get it tried to view it as a thriller when it isn't a thriller at all. The twist ending is obviously predictable from the start. The twist ending is so confusing that the whole thing makes no sense. M. Night Shyamalan's twist endings are growing old and he should quit putting them on his films. Only his first film really had a twist ending. His others, including this one, don't. The twist ending is what makes the movie great. The twist ending disappoints us by undermining what the movie appeared to be all about. The twist ending is supposed to undermine our expectations and exasperate us -- that's the point. It is set in the present day. It is set in 1892. Whew? What is with this movie after all? I might figure it out by watching it again.  I might be thrilled by the non-existent twist ending of this non-thriller. I might remember not to be scared by this non-horror movie that I failed to get the first time around around because expecting it to be horror ruins it. But I'm scared just thinking about the task of trying to relate to this movie in the right way. I'm on the edge of my seat with curiosity about this twist ending, and about whether it even exists or not -- the twist ending, that is, that I have to just sit back, relax, and not think about in order to get the movie and what it is really about.

SHYAMALAN'S MOVIES WERE NEVER MEANT TO BE HORROR FLICKS!!!!!

What Shyamalan seems to be aiming at with all of his movies (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, and The Village) is the creation of an entirely new genre.  Instead of making audiences jump at time-worn screamer moments, he draws the audience in and once he gets them on the edge of their seats he hits them with the unexpected: substance.

The movie isn't about the monsters or even the woods.  It's about...wait for it...the VILLAGE and the people who live in it.  As it turns out they are victims of a faceless fear that is identified by none other than a color-coated system.  Do the words ""Orange Alert"" seem strangely similar?

The bottom line:  If you're looking for a horror movie, you've wander off the path.  The story isn't scary.  If you're looking for a suspenseful, thought-provoking movie set in a captivating world, then you've hit your mark and need not go any further.",1105401600,3,1051,4.71978021978022

Trouble is, I might have missed something crucial, because friends talked me into going to it even though I had diarrhea at the time. So I might have missed something during one or more of the at least three ""pit stops"" I had to make during the movie. All I got out of it was that these people living in a ""colonial"" era like village for some reason within a scary forest, right about now in the twenty-first century, were being attacked and having their dream of a supposed utopia shattered by some monsters called ""those of whom we don't speak"". Yeah, there are subplots about a senseless attack by one villager upon another, and a blind girl sent alone to get medicines from ""the towns"". But none of that seemed to relate to the main story in any clear way. If the totality of reviews I read make any sense, one has to assume a clear identity for ""those of whom we don't speak"" was revealed in the end, and therein lay the ""twist ending"". I was there for the ending; that wasn't a part I missed. Nonetheless, what (if anything) was supposedly revealed in the end was as obscure and exasperating for me as any other part of this muddled movie. I still don't have any clear picture of what happened or what the big surprise was. I was inclined to find my potty breaks more interesting than the movie and to write off the movie as a pain in a certain region. But I'm sure some would discount my view because a pain there was happening for me at the time anyway.

2167687,1,B00064LJVO,"has anyone ever read the book Running Out of Time by Margaret Peterson Haddix? well i'm mentioning this because my ten year old sister read it in school and told me her teacher said the village was based on it. I then could almost have stuffed her down a drain for giving away the ending, because the plot of the book (let's not try to draw too many parellels shall we, after all we must preserve our innocense and thinking of such things as copying others work is bad) is this girl's sister is sick and her mom tells her that they live in a historical village isolated from the world and that she must go find medicine for her sister....  (sound too familiar????)  so anyway, i nearly squashed my little sis for ruining the twist of the movie. You see, at the time i thought it would be an amazing thrill like signs and sixth sense...  with that added sentimental typical story of disfunctional family stuff thrown in there for people to get indigestion over...  but what did i find out upon watching it?  the entire movie is a rip off of the book and the most boring thing i ever had to tie myself to a chair to sit through. I mean honestly, in the other movie's we see Night's full self (pretending to act) but in this one he just let us see the back of his head, does that not tell  you something? even he subconsciously knows he failed this time. I only hope he will redeem himself, because i liked signs, it had some humor...  Joaquin Phoenix was much better in a movie that was worth acting in. poor guy.

William Hurt is especially effective as the father who must make a choice that could be disasterous for all in the village.  This movie is a SHEEP in WOLVES clothing.

2167689,4,B00064LJVO,"Yes, this film is manipulative and at the end you feel like you've been deceived, that the director pulled a fast one on you and sold a completely different film in the movie trailers than the one you just watched, and that is the brilliant point of this film.  We are meant to be angered by the ending, to be mad that our expectations were played with and that we ultimately feel silly for getting scared in the beginning.  The point of this film is that there is nothing to be afraid of, that some people use fear as a controlling device to keep us in our place, and once we learn more or discover the world for ourselves, its not so scary after all.  Ignorance breeds fear, knowledge gives power.

The stand out performance in this film is Bryce Dallas Howard, who is simply phenomenal as a blind girl who must brave the dangerous woods to get medicine from the outside world and save the man she loves.  This is her first major film role and I'm glad that M Night Shyamalan takes risks like that, allowing unknown actors to carry a film, and Howard does it brilliantly.  I look forward to seeing her in more films.  The other performance I enjoyed is Joaquin Phoenix, who has a larger role in this one than he did in ""Signs"".  He plays a sharp and curious young man who makes repeated requests to leave the village to find out what's out there.  The village elders know that he's a handful and that his bravery surpasses that of everyone else in the Village.

The only unfortunate aspect of a Shyamalan film is that it now completely rests on the surprise twist or two at the end...which people actually sit through the film and try to predict the ending instead of enjoying the film without expectations of where it will go.  When I saw this in the theaters last summer, I could tell by the audience reaction that they were disappointed at the ending, but I sensed that most people missed the point entirely.  This film, more than ""Manchurian Candidate"", touches the current political nature of our country about how fear is being managed by our administration.  Just a few weeks before election day, ads came out featuring wolves to knock the Democrats as too weak to protect us, but my guess is that they never saw this film.  Its not the wolves we need to fear, but the elders who attempt to instill the fear in us so we won't discover the truth for ourselves.  See this film, see it for the allegory it is and don't try to guess the ending if you haven't seen it yet.  There is nothing to be afraid of, except our own fears.  This is worth owning on DVD and out of Shyamalan's four ""supernatural films"", I like this one second (after ""The Sixth Sense"" and before ""Signs"").  I hope for Shyamalan's sake that he surprises us all with his next film, by making it a straight-forward film without twists and surprises.

He grabbed our attention with the Sixth Sense but has been going down hill since. I really thought this movie was going to make up for the horrible Mel Gibson movie Signs, but Village loses it by the ending too. The plot, once you know what it is, is so far fetched that it ruins what was a good movie. There is great acting from everyone, especially Howard, except Adrien Brody. Brody, who plays a half-wit, comes off more annoying than retarded and almost leaves you longing for the guy that played the retarded character in Gigli (and I don't mean Ben Affleck). The creatures are cool looking (even if they rip off Brotherhood of the Wolf) and I didn't even mind their ""secret"" but wished they could have had a different reason. If the movie didn't have Howard, I think it would have been even worse because she really carries the show. Again, it started great, kept my attention but lost it on the ending.

Night's films aren't horror - by pure definition or that tiresome idea of morality play.  Night's films are rather comparable to 'fables'.  Remember Aesop?  Have you ever seen a fox that liked to eat grapes?  Nor have I, but the ideas taught in fables are the important thing.

""The Village"" works on several levels:  The desire of parents to have a better life for their children; protecting what we treasure; sacrificial love, etc.

""The Village"" points to the intrinsic value of a family structure, from religious or simply moral code of enforcement.  What we do to bring order and structure and ultimately safety for our family doesn't have to make sense to any one else.

The film can be taken politically as a statment on isolationism, religiously as a statement on fundamentalism, philosophically as a reflection on the value of politics or religion.

The problem with ""The Village"" is that it was released into a culture that really thought ""Joey"" was necessary, that Oprah is brilliant and that Trump has to be right because he's on TV and rich.

The relationship between Ivy (Bryce Dallas) and Lucius (Joaquin Pheonix). This movie is about what people would risk for the ones they love. The elders of the village would give up their innocence to try to keep their families safe from the evils of the world and in turn gave up a part of themselves in the procces putting their families in danger. And Ivy will put herself in harms way to save the man she loves. So take another look at this great movie and relearn the brilliance of one of modern film making's great directors. M. Night will only get better as the years go one but in my book he will have this movie as one of his benchmarks.",1105401600,6,1260,4.206611570247934
2167694,5,B00064LJVO,"The Village takes us on a journey through one of the greatest stories ever told. The way it was written, directed and acted are outstanding.  Certain people just don't get it. They don't see the brilliance in what M. Night did to make this an amazing movie.
We follow the lives of a small town in Pennsylvania, as they live their daily lives all while having the looming threat of the creatures that live in the woods. Not to be harmed, the villagers must never venture into the woods, for fear of danger.  But when tragedy strikes this lowly town - someone must step up.  Young Ivy Walker, the daughter of the village's head elder Edward Walker (William Hurt) fights with all her power to get permission to go through the woods, into the towns, to save Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), the man she loves.
Can Ivy fight the demons that the village faces? Can the secrets that hide throughout continue to stay secret? Can love overcome evil?
The Village is a whirlwind journey through thriller, romance, drama, and yes-even comedy at times. You feel as if you are Ivy fighting everything in your power, fearing everything around you just to get to the towns to save Lucius - and yourself.
Brilliant directing, writing, and acting - M Night, is definitely one of the greatest filmmakers around. And there is nothing but praise for this movie.
With the DVD showing extra features such as the making of The Village, deleted scenes, and an excellent commentary. The Village will be the only thing playing in my DVD player for a very long time.",1105401600,5,1531,4.642066420664206
2167695,5,B00064LJVO,"Normally one would call a fantasic film that pushes the boundaries of movie making a film that is ""ahead of its time.""  I disagree.  I think this one pushes the envelope backward a bit.  It strives not for amazing effects or expanding the boundaries of what is acceptable on screen in terms of sexuality or gore, but it strives for something that too often seems lost in hollywood today: thought.

Here's the bottom line: if you want a movie that challenges your brain to do something besides keep your heart moving, watch The Village.  If you want a movie that will kill whatever brain cells you have left after a lifetime of watching nothing but MTV, watch Alien Vs Preditor.  The Village requires reflection, patience, character development, and a good discussion later on the issue of whether evil is learned or inborn.  Notice how this movie sets the world on its head -the most ""innocent"" character is the most violent, the quietest is the bravest, the blind is the most adventursome, and the parents who are supposed to protect their children are the ones who by their own choice subject them to disease and death.

This is not a schmulzy shock/terror movie like ""Halloween"" or ""Friday the 13th.""  This is a film the likes of which hasn't been seen since Alfred the Great (Hitchcock) died.  This is a horror movie in the greatest sense: we have met the enemy, and we are him.",1105401600,15,1382,4.650205761316872
2167696,4,B00064LJVO,"""The Village"" is a good movie, but people keep expecting it to be a really scary movie with some sort of HUGE twist at the end. It isn't a scary movie (as the advertising seems to indicate), but it is suspenseful. There are some rather tense moments, but I would not call them scary or frightening. Neither does this movie have a big, surprising twist like ""The Sixth Sense"" (actually, that was the only movie of his that had a real big twist, yet people keep expecting it from him).

Many of this film's detractors  say ""I saw the 'surprise' coming from a mile away"" or ""the 'twist' was stupid."" I think they are missing the point of the movie and are probably the same people who complained about the aliens in ""Signs."" ""Signs"" is not a movie about aliens. ""Unbreakable"" is not a movie about comic books or men with super-powers. ""The Sixth Sense"" is not just about a little boy who sees dead people. ""The Village"" is not just a movie about a village in rural Pennsylvania in 1892. There's a deeper meaning here, but it seems that most people don't go to the movies to think or ponder, but merely to be entertained. If you're watching this movie for purely superficial reasons, you're going to be disappointed.",1105401600,2,1212,4.504545454545455

She can see just fine for the first half hour of the film (Note how EASILY and SWIFTLY she darted away from Brody and RAN across the field), THEN goes BLIND?!?!?! WHAT???? I hated the dialogue (Is there not a single contraction within this film? I do not think so). How does Joaquin Phoenix keep getting work? Like his character in Signs, ALL of his lines are spoken with a trembling over-seriousness. Most of all I hated Shyamalamadingdong's insistence on putting himself in the film yet again.

Unfortunatelly, a lot of the reviews are not giving it justice because: A) they are too young to appreciated the meaning of the story and to realize is not a ""Freddy vs. Jason"" type of movie.

B) most men went thinking it was going to be one of those action/terror movies, where you see an arm being cut off in mid air. This movie is neither. Is a well written and evelop story and so worth buying it. I am going shopping tonight!",1105401600,3,553,3.981981981981982

2167700,2,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan's films are about surprise endings, having the rug pulled out from under us.  The Village tries to capture the same magic as The Sixth Sense but falls woefully short mainly because we never experience that twist.  The secret of The Village is too easy to figure out.  In fact I think it would be hard NOT to get it before it is fully revealed.  If somehow you haven't figured it out by the time it is revealed, it doesn't pack near the punch of The Sixth Sense.  It's more an ""Oh, OK."" reaction than an ""Oh my God!  I can't believe that!""

The movie works best as a study in lighting, acting and cinematography as all are done very well.  Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy is always believable and somehow we easily empathize with her even though she is written one dimensionally.  Aside from an unending somber tone (the actors are rarely allowed to speak above a whisper), the films main problem is story which is impossible to talk about without revealing The Secret.  Suffice it to say that revelations come too early which pulls the audience outside the story and keeps us looking in instead of experiencing the characters terror right along with them.

The DVD transfer is very sharp with rich blacks that serve the moody lighting of the film very well.  The Village looks great on DVD.  The included documentary ""Deconstructing The Village"" (the most substantial extra at just under 30 minutes) covers the production in a brisk yet satisfying manner as long as you overlook all the numerous statements about how much like a family the entire cast became.  We've seen this kind of stuff many times before.  The four deleted scenes are bookended by Shyamalan who describes why each was cut in the first place but unlike what the packaging promises no ""clues to the movie's twists and turns"" are revealed.

Simply put, The Village is uninspired and flat though sometimes beautiful to look at.  Shyamalan needs to do something completely different for his next film, as his films have become predictable which is the death knell of any mystery/suspense film.  The story rates 1 star.  Production values rates 3 stars.  The DVD rates 3 stars.  Average = 2 stars.",1105315200,6,2176,4.703703703703703
2167701,1,B00064LJVO,So I got this movie thinking hey Shyamalan's other movies are pretty good. After watching it (trying to stay awake from the long played out acting) I wanted to launch my shoe at the tv. This movie could possibly be the most dissapointing movie I have ever seen. I will not ruin the ending. I will let the movie do that for you!!!!!,1105315200,2,331,4.26984126984127
2167702,3,B00064LJVO,"This movie was disappointing.  I didn't like the Sixth Sense and never saw Signs.  Yet, this movie just was disappointing.  You totally know the ending if you pay attention at the begining (I won't spoil it for those who want to see it).  Beware it was not scary.

The previews had hyped this movie up so much that it looked amazing! I am suprised that I stayed the whole time. Yet-it wasn't.  Even looking at the previews currently showing it looks like something I would love to see--but I don't care to watch it again.

It is your call on this movie--some people who I talked to loved it; others were like me and thought it was a joke.  It is one you will have to decipher on your own.",1105228800,,688,4.2384615384615385
2167703,4,B00064LJVO,"Ok, let's start by saying that all the previews and commercials about this movie are just...misleading. They briefly show you all the scary parts. (I mean it. Like, all 7 of them) What they leave out is the down time. ""Thriller"" might be too strong of a description. If you've seen M.Night's film ""Signs"" starring Mel Gibson, or ""The Sixth Sense,"" then you know what I mean. Great movie, just not wet-your-pants scary.

 The Village starts out slow, but it makes you want to learn more about what's going on in this Amish-like village out in the middle of nowhere (or seemingly nowhere...). Things are not what they appear to be. People are not what they appear to be. The lovely village has many secrets and innocent young people caught in its lies.

Bryce Dallas Howard is pretty Oscar-worthy if you ask me. Apparently she's new, but she took the bull by the horns and ran with her part. She plays the main protagonist, Ivy, a good-hearted, optimistic blind girl who eventually has to brave the monsterous woods beyond the boundary of the village to save her love's life. The plot is traditional, but M.Night executes such refreshing, unexpected ways of depicting it. This movie actually has a heartwarming, almost painstaking charm because of Ivy's intense determination to succeed--to overcome her blindness, her obstacles, her feelings, her doubts.

I don't want to give away the story, so I'll just say that M.Night likes to weave clues and catchy little twists into his films, so that if you go back and watch it again, you're like, ""Oh, now I know why he did that!"" or ""Hey, I missed that little piece before."" Everything falls into place so nicely, like a finished puzzle. (A sidenote: I don't think there was a single word of profanity in this movie. My hearing was spared for once).

For those who like to be thrilled and chilled in the not-wet-your-pants sort of way, this DVD is great. You can even relearn--pleasantly--that love is still blind.",1105142400,,1958,4.76401179941003

Romance talk. This was a weird movie. The movie was about Amish residents who believed there were evil creatures who lived in the borders of their village. It excited me at first, but later they revealed a secret about the creatures that you probably do not want to hear. This movie to me, well... it sucked.

The only good thing I have to say about this movie is that Bryce Dallas Howard did turn in quite a good performance, despite what seemed like a phoned-in effort from director Shyamalan.  It was so bad, they may as well have had Stevie Wonder direct (no offense Stevie).  I think that Shyamalan's formula is definately wearing thin, and I'm just sick of it.  Definately the most boring movie I have ever sat through.  I guess I just kept thinking that Shyamalan would pull it off in the end, which he did not.  This movie was like an experiment in bad film making.  I wouldn't suggest viewing this movie, unless it's free.",1105142400,,671,4.450819672131147
2167706,4,B00064LJVO,"Before M. Night Shyamalan morphed into the Rod Serling of movies, he made very funny and clever short amateur films. Why do I bring this up? Because Shyamalan's film plays like an extended version of ""The Twilight Zone"" and his amateur films were imitations of the film directors he admired (Spielberg for one). You may figure out ""The Village"" before the end like I did but even if you figure out the ending, ""The Village"" remains a suspeneful ride for its duration.

Set in an isolated, small rural town with homes straight out of the early 18th century, ""The Village"" the people live in is surround by woods where mythical beasts live. The townspeople and the creatures developed an alliance early on; the peole of the village will never venture into the woods and, in turn, the creatures will remain in the woods. As long as this balance exists, the two can peacefully co-exist. Things change with the death of a little boy. When the death occurs Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix)offers to brave the woods and go to the nearest town for vitally needed medicines. Ivy Hunt (the marvelous Bryce Dallas Howard who gives a wonderful performance)is the only other person in the town thaan Lucius who seems without fear. Ivy's blindness also gives her a unique perception of others. The elders of the town including Edward Walker (William Hurt), August Nicholson (Brendan Gleeson) and Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver) all seem against the idea of leaving the village particularly when the creatures start showing up in the village at night. It seems as if their fragile truce and existence will be coming to an end.

A well constructed suspense thriller ""The Village"" shares much in common with Shyamalan's other thrillers ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs""). Although the formula of at the heart of his films might be wearing a bit thin for critics, filmgoers will enjoy ""The Village"" for the atmospheric world that Shyamalan dreams up. The suspenseful pacing, twists & turns in the plot and strong performances by the cast will make ""The Village"" memorable. It's a worthwhile film even if a bit predictable by the conclusion of the film. I have to give Shyamalan credit he reveals a key plot point 2/3rds through the movie not unlike Hitchcock did with his classic film ""Vertigo"". It takes tremendous self confidence and as the plot finally begins to take shape, audiences will appreciate it (although some will be mad just as they were at Hitchcock when he made his classic film).

The DVD comes with a whole host of special features including deleted scenes, a production photo gallery, Bryce Dallas Howard reading from the diary she kept on set during production and a documentary (broken down into a number of smaller ""featurettes"") called ""Deconstructing The Village"" that takes the viewer step-by-step through the production of the film. We learn, for example, why an early version of the creatures (aka ""Those We Don't Speak Of"")was abandoned as an onset effect. Shyamalan also shares some of his ideas on what makes a movie suspenseful and the cast discusses the symbolism of ""The Village"" and ""Those That We Don't Speak Of"". Shyamalan, like a lot of film directors (most notably Steven Spielberg) didn't want to do a commentary track perhaps fearing tht it might rob the film of its mystique. It's a pity as his working methods during production and abandoned early concepts would have been particularly interesting and wouldn't have hurt the film at all.

Take the wooded path and stop in at ""The Village"" where the world isn't quite what it seems. Rod Serling would be proud of the twists, turns and symbolism in ""The Village"" and that's high praise, indeed. Thanks to Buena Vista Home Video and amazon.com for providing me with an early review copy. The film prompted much discussion among my family at the conclusion.",1105056000,,3833,4.910493827160494

2167708,4,B00064LJVO,"Summary: The critics won't have you believe it, but M. Night Shyamalan hasn't misfired yet as the suspense director of his generation. The Village falls somewhere between Signs and Unbreakable in the hierarchy of his films, but the worst of his creations are so far beyond the Hollywood norm, it's difficult to take insults seriously. Once again, we are faced with a suspense-heavy plot with a twist at the end, and once again this sacrifices a bit of forward motion. An isolated village in the Pennsylvania woods is safe from the wickedness of the corrupting towns, but it has its own problems. For one, they lack medicine and other supplies that might be available to them if there was a link to the outlying world. For another, the surrounding woods are populated by creepy humanoid creatures that are attracted to the color red and seem to be ready to kill on sight. Joaquin Phoenix is repeatedly requesting permission to go to town, after an unspecified disease kills a young boy, but he is just as frequently denied by the elders. But when he is stabbed by a mentally retarded friend in a fit of jealous anger, his blind lover is given permission to go to town and get the medicine she needs to save him. There are a series of twists at the end, with the least surprising involving a well-intentioned plot by the town elders.

  This was another strong outing by M. Night, and was also a refreshing break from movies in which overly-solemn youngsters play a major role.",1104796800,,1475,4.665384615384616
2167709,3,B00064LJVO,"I would suggest more people contact Vista Series as to why Signs and now The Village have been released with no DTS 5.1 audio track on them.

If you do not have a home theatre system then this review probably will not do you any good but I am reviewing the DVD NOT the movie - which I throughly enjoyed.

On The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable there were DTS tracks on them which resulted in a glorious audio experience when watching either movie as the audio in Shyamalan's movies is equally as important as the visuals. The clarity of the DTS tracks on the first two DVD's is incredible. Signs was a huge let down for me as a home theatre afficionado as there was no DTS track on it.

Now I was so looking forward to getting The Village as it is a fantastic movie and I see on the page here that there is only a DOlby Digital 5.1 EX track listed. That is quite surprising and I am hoping someone may read this review that is in someway connected to Vista and may suggest they release another version.

There is a reason why Peter Jackson has only a Dolby track on the theatrical releases of all of the Lord Of The Rings movies and then adds a DTS 6.1 ES track on the Platinum Editions you know - it's because DTS audio is far superior.

I really hope to see either a special edition of this released at some point or even a Superbit version (Superbit DVD's always have a DTS track on them) so the audio is up to par when compared to Unbreakable or The Sixth Sense.",1104537600,2,1462,4.170212765957447

My personal opinion? IT ROX! The plot is phanomieal, and the twist to the end is the best I've ever seen. This is definately one of the best movies i have ever seen.

No, i'm one of those ""this is a horror movie so let me kick back and enjoy it"" types. I find horror movies fun to watch and a great escape from the real world.

With that said, i am very sad to say that this had to be one of the worse movies i have ever seen and M. Night Shyamalan has got to be one of the worse directors ever. Everyone says that he does his movies in a different fashion and that he is soo creative. I honestly think he just doesn't know what he is doing. His movies just don't seem to flow very well and they all seem to drop off at the ending. You need a good ending to have a good movie. Plain and simple.

Sixth Sense: it turns out Bruce Willis was dead the whole time.  Ohhh, who cares. It was so predictable. Like he could live with his wife for 1 year and not notice she would never talk or acknowledge him. Horrible!

Unbreakable: I wouldn't even consider this an ending. The whole movie was leading up to it and then ____________<--nothing. Big big big let down.

Signs: not even going to get into this one.

And finally this movie. My opinion of this movie might have been different if the ending wasn't so stupid. You can't make a movie, set back in the day, about a secluded village where in the woods there is a ""monster"" and then find out that they are actually living in modern times and there is really no monster. It just tore the whole movie down. Everything he was building up was torn down. The whole movie was a lie. That's not a creative ending. That's an ending from someone who saw ""The Truman Show"" one to many times and said ""oh, oh, me too, me too!""

I really hate to say this about a movie, but by all means stay clear of this movie, and all of his movies for that matter. If someone asks you if you want to watch it, do yourself a favor. Turn, run to your car, and drive away as fast as possible!",1103414400,2,2011,4.0376884422110555
2167713,2,B00064LJVO,"After every M. Night Shyamalan picture since ""Unbreakable"", I always make the same vow: to never, ever pay to see another one of his movies in theaters.  But somehow, I always find myself back in the theater, waiting to be amazed again, like I was for ""The Sixth Sense.""  It's the trailers!!  Most trailers are so awful these days, filled with choppy editing and the same songs that seeing a *good* trailer is a breath of fresh air.  The trailer for ""The Village"" pulled me in with its unspoken promise of resolving the conflict between the ""creatures"" who inhabit the woods surrounding a remote 18th century village, and the villagers themselves, who have a tacit agreement not to enter the woods, as long as the creatures do not enter their village.  In the trailer, this agreement is introduced to the audience, and then we get to watch as it is abruptly breached, with red marks slashed across the doors of their homes, and frightened villagers heading for their cellers with cries of ""Don't let them in!""  After seeing the trailer, I was dying to know A) What the creatures were, B) How a bunch of 18th century people planned to fight them back into the woods & C) What will the inevitable Shyamalan twist be?

After viewing the movie, I dicovered that the ""inevitable Shyamalan twist"" can be safely described as the ""inevitable Shyamalan letdown.""  His biggest mistake was showing us the creatures halfway through the movie.  The tension created by wondering what the creatures are is gone, and the rest of the film's tension is the result of clever directorial tricks.  Besides that, anyone can figure out what one aspect of the ""twist"" will be just by looking at the ""creature.""  Figuring out the other aspect isn't too difficult either, and I found myself predicting the ending, which really detroyed the experience of watching it.  (Don't worry, I have no plans of destroying anyone else's, so there won't be anymore said about the ""twist."")

It's regrettable, however, that Shyamalan's twist endings have become more of a handicap than anything else.  Most people think a twist is very clever, but as a film major and screenwriter, I can assure you that it's often just a cop-out for the writer, because it keeps him/her from having to fully resolve the conflicts that were introduced in the script.  The ultimate twist ending is ""The Wizard of Oz,"" with its ""it was all a dream"" wrap-up.  Well great.  If it's a dream, then why did it matter?  What was the point of watching it?  ""The Wizard of Oz,"" however was worth watching for its enchanting story line, its remarkable musical numbers and its enduring quality.  ""The Village"" has none of these things.  Maybe some musical numbers would have livened it up!  Along with everything else that's wrong with it, I have to say that this was honestly the dullest, slowest movie Shyamalan has made.

I think Shyamalan is a filmmaker who made a big, splashy debut with the masterpiece that is ""The Sixth Sense"" and since then, he has been unable to measure up to that.  And perhaps it's not fair that we expect him to . . . but we certainly should have expected better than this, and for $8.50 a ticket, we should have received it.

Notes on the DVD: there's no commentary and not very many extras, so a ""special edition"" is inevitable.  If you're bound and determined to throw your money away on this DVD, you might as well wait for that, so you can get more out of it.",1103328000,2,3426,4.658901830282862
2167714,3,B00064LJVO,"Much like what can be called Shyamalan's sophmore slump UNBREAKABLE, this is one of those ""watch it once"" movies since you can only really enjoy this movie once, and UNBREAKABLE at least was a bit of a surprise.  Shyamalan is a great talent, someone who wants to make movies with real characters, action and thrills, but his well is running dry and if he doesn't dig deeper he may lose his fans to the next new talent with a cool idea for a film.

THE VILLAGE is one of those ""best looking bad movies"" a movie where the plot and the story is so lame or predictable (the plot came to me as I was thinking of old commercials for tv shows like Alien Autopsy and Discovering the Titanic, think about it or email me if you want my insight on this) but the rest of the movie is beautiful with a good atmosphere and characters you like, remember and can believe.  The movie almost depends on the characters too much to fill in the holes where we are expecting to see the monsters jump out on you and shock.  I don't mind seeing movie characters talk and discuss things be it the problem at hand or their lives but when your watching a movie where it's billed as a thriller where these characters will be in peril or in trouble (much like SIGNS) and your given something else, it's a buzzkill of sorts.  You sit down wanting a cheeseburger and you get grilled chicken, yeah it's good, but not what I wanted or expected.

Thats another problem with the movie and it's happened before with movies where in the commercials show you all the good parts.  If you've seen the commercials you've seen all the best parts, and if the thriller elements are all your interested in, then you gotta pass.  There are a couple more that weren't shown and they were only okay.

I can lay down a good law for movies right now and this goes right back up to my first paragraph, ANY movie where you can see the ending coming and your correct about it, will more then likely dissapoint you and if it's a twist ending that you see, double the dissapointment, (triple it if the movie telegraphs its ending a mile away twist or no).  Hopefully Shyamalan's next movie will be better, or at least live up to what the commercials show us.",1102464000,,2203,4.351219512195122

Nigh Shyamalan's The Village, he does all of those things.  Regardless of how much I did or did not like it, I consider the film a SHOCKER!! A definite ""Must-see"".  A ""Must-Own"" DVD.  Maybe the craziest, but most brilliant twist I have ever seen.",1102464000,,951,4.303370786516854
2167716,5,B00064LJVO,"Ok, folks, after his last few films, was anyone really surprised by the slow pace of much of this film, and the surprise ending? That's what M. Night Shyamalan does! His movies are not about the monsters and special effects -- each is a discourse on morality and spirituality. The lesson here is on family and protecting your children - how far would you go?

I loved this film. it was probably closest to 'Signs' in pace and message. Visually, it was stunning. I love the way Shyamalan captures the facial expressions and feelings of his characters, and while I guessed the outcome of the film, it was still great to sit and watch.",1102291200,11,632,4.543859649122807

Every commercial that I ever saw about this movie led me to believe that there was a scary monster in the woods and that this was going to be some sort of supernatural monster movie, but when you get right down to it, all this movie is, is a drama with a twist. The whole movie Shamalan kept you guessing but basically he just led you to believe that the monster was real, then it wasn't, then it was, then it wasn't!!!

When I left the theater I felt cheated. I have to admit, there were some good scares and it was a well written story, but every single article,trailer and review for this movie are hugely misleading.",1102204800,,752,4.222222222222222
2167718,3,B00064LJVO,"* NO MAJOR SPOILERS *

Though I personally feel that Signs is M. Night's worst movie, The Village isn't exactly high on my A List.

The movie begins with a village man (presumably a minister or elder) mourning loudly over a casket of someone. The movie continues to reveal some clues as to the results: the color red, the woods, and the small, dead animals.

The main questions asked are, ""Who are the creatures in the woods, What do they want, and Do they really exist?""

Some of M. Night's traditional usage of humor is placed in the movie. I don't want to reveal it, but it'll catch you offguard.

I felt that the love story was necessary, but sort of drug on in the beginning. Most of the people came to crap their pants and answer questions, not see much love.

The bottom line is that if you are a Night fan, see it. It you liked The Sixth Sense, do yourself a major favor and DO NOT COMPARE THIS TO IT! You'll be very disappointed if you do. I personally feel that Night didn't fully explain some of the details; it seemed that he sat down and wrote up a storm, then forgot about the ending. It was about 4 in the morning, so he just threw together something that didn't explain much of anything or offer much symbolism.",1102204800,,1227,4.29004329004329
2167719,2,B00064LJVO,"After seeing The Village, I began wondering exactly how much money M. Night Whatever made off The Sixth Sense. It's more than you think. Because revenue-wise, most of Unbreakable, half of Signs, and virtually all of The Village is the remnant of it. What exactly am I saying? I'm saying that had it not been for The Sixth Sense and the hope of genius that it brings with it, not only would I have not paid money for any of these latest three, they probably would have never even been made. Shyamalan has steadily grown more and more mediocre since his brilliant debut.

I've wondered why this is from time to time, and a quick glance at the film credits yields the answer - Shyamalan has been given more control, and when one person has as much control as he has on a film, it's a dangerous thing. The fact is that although he wrote and directed all four of these films, he did *not* produce The Sixth Sense; he *did* produce the other three. That means the following - any of the poor plot/direction/writing choices that Shyamalan made on The Sixth Sense were caught and regulated by someone else - on the latest three? Nope. He had the control and could do whatever his little heart desired. Combine this with the fact that The Sixth Sense was just a brilliant idea and the others were somewhat lamer and less dramatic, and you have your answer to the question of how the mind that gave us The Sixth Sense also gave us ""Swing away!""

So that brings us to The Village. If The Truman Show and The Big Chill had an ugly baby, it would be M. Night Shyamalan's The Village. Once again, after an impressive ad campaign based mostly on the belying ""from the writer/director of the 6th Sense!"" tag, Shyamalan delivers a complete and utter dud.

It has an interesting enough premise. There is an 18th century village that is bordered by thick woods, populated by mystical and deadly creatures. The village supposedly has a peace treaty with the creatures, but then strange things begin happening - animals turn up dead, marks are painted on the doors, noises are heard at night. Meanwhile a bizarre love story is developing between Lucius (Jaoquin Pheonix) and the blind quasi-female-lead Ivy (Bryce Howard). Circumstances then dictate that someone needs to go to the ""towns"" to get medicine, something that is strictly forbidden within the village.

I don't want to give away the ""surprise"" so I can't say much more. Suffice it to say that there is one, at least in Shyamalan's mind. And here we come to the problem with every one of his last three disasters. He seems to think that he found a formula with The Sixth Sense - build up suspense then unleash a massive twist - and he keeps trying to plug in various plots and characters to the same equation. I think the problems with this are numerous. First of all, we all know it's coming. With The Sixth Sense, we didn't know what to expect at all. Would there be a twist? Who knew? Furthermore the ""build-up"" to this twist was effortless and almost unnoticeable in The Sixth Sense but in the subsequent films it's relentlessly hammered into the viewer from the opening credits - even from the previews. So we all know there's a twist coming and there's all this shameless build-up, so much so that *nothing* could possibly live up to it. So when Shyamalan unveils his little surprise at the end? It will inevitably be a limp let-down.

Couple that with the fact that The Village doesn't have that grand of a premise anyway. If you are actually able to untangle Shyamalan's ""moral"" at the end of this mess, it's truly pointless. Essentially the village head goes against his own rules and in the process disproves his own point, but doesn't even seem to realize it with a bunch of meaningless rhetoric about ""hope."" Ultimately his whole experiment is a failure, much like this movie.

A final word - Shyamalan's dialogue is the worst I've ever heard in a major motion picture. I felt this to be true in Signs and it's even truer in The Village. I was literally covering my face in embarrassment a few times, most noticeably during the ""Let's shout it from the rooftops!"" monologue on love, and after Lucius' ""...and yes...I will dance with you,"" trembling declaration. Again - this is the result of one person having too much creative control. Nobody is able to step in (as they presumably were in The Sixth Sense) and say ""No, this needs to change."" Shyamalan seems completely oblivious to this. I expect that he'll continue putting out these self-made movies for many more years, always trying to get back to what he achieved with The Sixth Sense and always falling short.

I don't think he'll get many more chances from me.",1102118400,2,4671,4.606971153846154

Appreciate it for what it is: a message to the human race. A message that is so obvious and yet so ignored.

2167722,1,B00064LJVO,"This movie was the worse movie I ever spent money on. By the end of the movie there were 3 people left in the theather, me, my daughter and this elderly lady that Im sure if she could have gotten up without assistance would have been gone as well. My duaghter begged me to take her to see it and then begged me to leave mid way through it. I kept saying lets wait an while maybe it will get better. Well needless to say it just kept getting worse.

Plot: Lets see a bunch of people dressed like Pilgrims live in the woods. They were all victims of violence so moved her to escape the world. Everything is pure. Main actors were a blind chick, her furture husband, her family and this mentally insane guy. Anyway, the crazy guy likes the blind chick so stabs the future husband and the only person brave enough to go into the woods to get help or medicine was the blind chick. The majority of the movie was about the blind girl feeling her way through the woods. Hello, a little more please!

Anyway, the whole monsters part were the elders of the town (woods) who would dress up like Little red riding hood and go around skinning animals to make everyone think these so called monsters (the unspoken ones) really existed. While the blind girl is in the woods, the crazy guy steals the costume and goes after her. Ok a little action right? Not! She stands in front of a pit with her arms extended and when he charges at her, she steps over 2 feet and he falls in. WOW what a smart move.

I felt so cheated after this movie was finally finished. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. My daughter still kicks herself for driving me nuts to go see it. We laugh about it now because it was just so stupid and such a waste.",1101859200,4,1723,4.215151515151515
2167723,1,B00064LJVO,"Sorry, people, but this movie has the most moronic plotline perhaps ever devised. Warning: people with even average IQ's might find this sad and/or stupid. Seriously, if you are looking for a suspenseful, heart-pounding movie, this is not it. This isn't even hack and slash horror. Not even _horror_. This is nonsense.

Well, it is about a blind girl (Ivy, I think, right?) who, after her future hubby is shanked by the village retard (literally), goes into the dreaded woods to get him medicine.

OK, first I'll go back, this is a village that is a cross between the Puritans and the Pilgrims, with all their worst traits. Red is deemed the 'bad' color, and must be avoided at all costs. Yellow is the 'safe' color. The villagers are afraid of monsters in woods (red attrachs them [?]), who we learn are actually the villagers dressed up in costumes.

Alright, so the story starts out with the blind girl (who has an amazing sense of direction, even running in perfectly straight lines without need of assistance) and her friends. However, the mentally retarded boy doesn't understand the difference between friends and lovers and thus stabs Ivy's fiance. However, even after being stabbed in the stomach and chest, without antibiotics or even medical attention for hours, *he lives*!!! I am sorry to say I was fighting laughter at this point.

Then, the beasts from the woods start breaking the truce that was set between them and the villagers, and skinned animals start appearing on the ground. Sometimes even the actual monsters are seen, which, by the way, look like a cross between little red ridding hood and a porcupine.

The blind girl decides to go the `towns' to get medicine for the stabbed boy.

After this, she confronts a monster in the woods (!) who trips and falls in a pit, and it is really the retard boy! Omigod, this is too scary! So, continuing, she finds a road, and with surprising clarity, runs down it and into a wall, which she marvelously scales, and falls down on the other side just as a ranger-type person is driving down the road.

She seeks his help, and employs him to get a list of medicine (they are aware of the most recent medicines in the village, obo) and miraculously he manages to get it, even as somebody else is watching him steal from the first aid bin. Needless to say, the older man doesn't ask why the younger ranger is raiding the medicine box (he's no junkie!) and the ranger gives the medicine back to Tarzan/Ivy who scales the wall again and returns to the village.

We learn that the village's founders all had family/friends who were victim of crime, and so they tried to escape society inside the state park. Yup, that's where the village is. A park. They apparently paid people off not to fly planes over it, etc. So anyway, they learn, yadda yadda, that they couldn't escape society because they were society. Actually a pretty good theme, if only dulled by crappy acting and an even crappier/unrealistic plot.

So, in the end the girl with her hands covered in dirt and God-knows-what-else is hugging her fiance.

I started laughing midway through, and the row of teenagers behind me (older than me) started laughing too. If you want a comedy, this is a great movie to pick apart.",1101600000,9,3239,4.676625659050966

2167725,1,B00064LJVO,"The movie's been going for an hour and a half and all they've done is send a blind girl alone into a most dreaded and feared forest! Why? To preserve their probably already doomed way of life. And what is that way of life? It is the way of life of an eightteenth century-like village of paranoids who have chosen to isolate themselves from tewnty-first century life, which they all for their own reasons equate with supreme evil. The place they locate their village is very stupid or very unlucky one of the two. For the nearby woods are infested with some unspeakable evil that menaces the village. Just what that evil is will keep you in suspense the whole way through. But believe me, there will never be an answer worth waiting for. When the blind sojourner reaches some other form of (civilization?!?), what does it turn out to be? A mysterious wildlife refuge of some sort. Did the villagers knowingly locate their village adjacent to a preserve inhabited by some dread beasts? The one suggestion that they might have is that some head honchos of the village have the name Walker. And what is the refuge's name? It's the Walker Wildlife Refuge! So one suspects there is a more than coincidental connection and juxtaposition between the village and the refuge. But just what is that connection? I have no idea, even though I watched  the movie. And believe me. It's not worth troubling your mind over. The refuge is made very mysterious, to be sure! We hear two wildlife officers talk briefly and just in that we know that the place reeks of intriguing secrecy that would make the fabled ""Area 51"" look about as mysterious as Sam's Club or Incredible Universe by comparison. But such is just the problem herein. This movie has diarrhea of mystery and constipation of solution! Just accept it that the movie is a mystery less destined toward a solution that a blind girl wandering alone through a menacing forest. And why was she sent into the forest in the first place? A member of the village committed a murder - no, a near-murder, since the victim was clinging to life. The girl was sent in search of medicine. And who is the attempted murdered? Some reviews call him ""the village idiot"". But, duh! How did they ever guess? No, I mean seriously, how were we to know? I think the term ""village idiot"" owes its existence to the fact that in a small village an ""idiot"" can stand out by virtue of being the only ""idiot"" there. But in THIS village, who ISN'T a good candidate for being an idiot? Virtually everyone here acts in manners rash, inscrutible, and potentially idiotic. So if the movie meant for this character to stand out as a ""village idiot"" they were so barking up the wrong tree, not just that, up the wrong freaking forest!  When everyone in this flick acts so freaking wierd, at least it is acting. But that is no redeeming feature, unfortunately. The film does have (read waste) some prominent actors, such as William Hurt and Adrian Brody, who acted so bizarre that  I had no idea it was them until afterwards. And even Sigourney Weaver had me guessing for the first half who she was, so thouorghly was she in hot pursuit of not playing herself for once! Acting, eerieness, suspense -- this movie has it all! All, that is, except anything ultimately happening to make us care a whit about all that acting, eerieness, and suspense! Suck on that! e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e!",1101513600,15,3389,4.635607321131448

That far seemed interesting to me, but then the movie dragged down, and didn't stop going down untill it's suprise ending. Even tho the ending was suprising, it still made very little sense.

The main guy of the village and the other elders were fed up with the violence and corruption in our society during the 70's, so they decided to form their own society free of any violence and mayham.  They set up a small village within a private wooded area so no one would make their way into the village area, nor would the village folk want to leave.  That's where the ""Creatures"" come in.  They are made up.  The Elders made them up and dressed up like them to keep those in the village from trying to get out into the ""real"" society.  I don't know how anyone would ""NOT"" understand this movie.  It's all spelled out within the movie.  I think it's a fantastic movie, and makes me think about how wonderful it would be to live in such a place.  It's not a bad idea if you think about it.  And also, to the Gretchen Weiners or somebody who was wondering why the blind girl was sent.  It's obvious that she was sent because she wouldn't know what was around her.  So, she wouldn't get tempted to look around or stay.  She was sent into the ""Creature infested"" woods by her dad, because he knew there were no creatures to begin with.  So, no harm done.  I'm sorry if i've given away the whole plot of the movie, but a lot of people have on here.

2167729,4,B00064LJVO,"Every time someone reviews an M. Night Shyamalan movie they seem to spend all of their time talking about the twist ending. I feel like they might be missing the point.

Shyamalan's movies are all built on the tension between creepy supernatural goings-on and an almost excruciating everyday realism. The thing about the realism is that he bothers to do the legwork. He builds the world from the ground up every time, spending the first half of the movie lingering on glasses of water and shoes. And I'm not saying he's Wong Kar-Wai or anything, but he does this very well. So you spend an hour sitting there watching this, knowing that something isn't quite right. Even Unbreakable - which, for reasons I've never been able to properly articulate, I hated - pulled this off.

Some people find this slow 'n' boring, but I enjoy it. I don't go in expecting to be BLOWN AWAY by a TWIST, even though I know there's going to be one. I just enjoy watching this fully-rendered world, there on the screen waiting to get twisted. There's a difference.

Shyamalan isn't one of my favorite directors, by any means, but he's a guy doing his thing, and his thing isn't quite like anyone else's thing, and he does it well. The world, and Hollywood in particular, could use more of that.",1101427200,,1273,4.599118942731278
2167730,2,B00064LJVO,"This time when I went with my best friends to see a movie, my friend Karen was so totally NOT the only one who didn't understand the movie. For some reason a group of people have built themselves a village in the middle of a wildlife preserve, where they all live pretty much like people back around the time of the first Thanksgiving. But it is so clearly in the time of the modern world. For we DO see towns with present day cars, and a wildlife officer patrols the preserve in a modern Jeep or similar vehicle. The people of the village fear some sort of attacks from some fierce creatures that inhabit the woods around them. Are these attackers beasts of the wildlife preserve? Who knows? Or are they some fierce humans? No theory totally makes sense. The villagers do some vague talk about ""the ones we don't speak of"". But they so totally use that phrase often to speak of the ones they ""don't speak of""! Do these fierce attackers really exist? You can so totally sit through the whole movie eerily wondering that but so totally never get any answers! Anyhow, there does come a time when the village's idyllic way of life is indeed disrupted in a totally bloody way. But it isn't by any fierce and mysterious outside invaders. It is when one member of the village just up and stabs another almost to death for totally no reason. The victim is badly wounded, and they decide that his only hope for recovery is getting medicine from ""the towns"" that they so vaguely speak of. At least they don't call then ""the towns we don't speak of"". And if you thought this movie couldn't get any more weird, that is just when it gets so totally weirder! Who do they decide must travel to ""the towns"" to get medicines? Well, they send the fiancee of the stabbed man. At least she is one who cares about him very much. But guess what? She's blind! Yes, And THAT's whom they decide they must send ALONE through the supposedly monster-infested woods to ""the towns"" to get medicines. So she embarks on the mission, seeming to so totally have no chance of success. At one point as she seems to wander aimlessly through these woods where no other villagers dare to tread, the ground before her, as if it were glacial ice, opens up into a deep crevasse. And she so totally falls straight into the crevasse. But as if miraculously, she manages to climb out. Braving these and other dangers, she DOES get the medicine and returns to the village. How does she do it? Who knows? It is one of the so many unsolved mysteries of this movie. Like my friend Karen, this movie's heroine must have a fifth sense. That's all I can say. So she returns and there's a happy ending? Right? Who knows? This movie is just so totally unpredictable, but NOT in a good way! Just as she gets back to her fiancee, the movie abruptly ends, leaving everything as mysterious as ever. Now I'm afraid my friend Karen will think we're just being mean to not explain this movie to her. But we're her friends. We work hard at keeping her from putting her foot in her mouth (or her fist either). We protect her from lots of things and TRY to explain everything she doesn't understand?

The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs sit comfortably in that section, just ready to be slid from its case and inserted into the disc player.  Through these three films, you have crafted pure cinematic genius.  Unfortunately, it is at these three that I must draw the line.  Mr. Shyamalan, what happened?  Are you sick or something?  Has there been some tragic event that has occurred that has impaired your ability to make good films?  Please, sir, tell me why your latest film, The Village sucked so bad?

  Mr. Shyamalan, I must find out why you have made such an abysmal film, after succeeding wildly with your first three.  As per your other films, moviegoers greedily expected another gem in The Village, complete with the signature surprise ending that shocks the audience and reveals the mystery.  I was shocked, yet I still see a mystery.

  Note to readers: The following is a plot spoiler, but theres not that much of a plot to spoil.  For those of you who have not seen the film, I am still going to reveal the `plot' to you anyways.  There is a 19th century Pennsylvania town, inhabited by roughly 100 individuals, and are kept there peacefully, under the menacing watch of creatures which reside in the woods.  The creatures are revealed to be a hoax, and a man in a costume acts as the monster to ensure that the villagers do not stray to the outlying area and discover the truth: They do not live in the 19th century, they live in the present day, and their `village' is really a cultural experiment put on by the `elders' (counselors at an Philadelphia support center) to observe society at its purest, rather than having it subjected to the horrors of today's world.  By the way, the village remains undiscovered by the outside world because it is located in a wildlife preserve, where aircraft are prohibited from flying over, and where people are prohibited from venturing into.  Pretty cool idea, huh?

  Mr. Shyamalan, your film simply DOES NOT WORK.  If the elders are the only persons in this village who know the truth behind its existence, then where did the rest of the village come from?  There are young children and families who reside in the village, all of whom were clearly not born in the village.  Where were they born, if they still remain ignorant towards the truth behind the village?  It doesn't make any sense Mr. Shyamalan.

  This is by no means a letter to discourage anyone from seeing your film.  On the contrary, I encourage viewers to see the film, yet only to keep a VERY OPEN mind during the process.  There are many questions that you leave unanswered and unaccounted for.  It was a great idea and a great attempt, but it fell short.

  I conclude this letter with a plea.  M. Night Shyamalan, please continue to make movies.  Your previous films were entertaining, innovative, marvelous, and often humorous.  Unfortunately, those for adjectives do not apply to The Village.  Your movies are great.  Scare us, shock us, frighten us, and by all means entertain us.... just don't confuse us.",1100908800,2,3752,4.646341463414634
2167735,5,B00064LJVO,"I am not a big M. Night Shyamalan fan and have not really liked any of his other works... In fact, I thought they were pretty dumb. ""The Village"" however is the cream that rises to the top of Shyamalan's portfolio. To all of you people out there who thought this movie sucked, I must respectfully say that you are wrong. ""The Village"" is not a crappy movie it is just a movie that presents us something we are not expecting. Admittedly it draws you in as a horror movie or at least a suspense thriller but it evolves into/ is something else... maybe even something better.

""The Village"" is really a story of love and utopian beliefs and whether or not they can come to fruition either today or at any point in the history of man. This movie explores the relationships between: a man and a woman, friends, family and community and then produces a well thought out work of art. For those of you out there who think that the artsy shots were for nothing, did you listen to the dialogue were you watching the same movie? I think this movie may not be for the standard audience, and that perhaps it would have done better as an art house flick because it is full of meanings and symbolism the average viewer may not understand. Shyamalan has crafted a movie with as much intellect as a book and that is no easy feat.

All of you who understood this movie should pat yourself on the back and all of you who didn't should watch it again because it is perhaps one of the best movies of the year.",1100736000,4,1488,4.291814946619217
2167736,4,B00064LJVO,"the first thing I thought about this movie is, it's a very ambitious one, because of the name of the pic, ""M. Night Shyamalan's The Village"", i mean, ""the Village"" is not a very appealing name, and the look at cast, i don't know anyone except Joaquin Phoenix (that's my problem, i know, but let's face it, i'm not the only one, right?), so that make the only reason to go to theatre and see the movie is Mr. Shyamalan!

if you think it's like ""The Sixth Sense"", i tell you what, it go even further, I'd been sitting inside the theatre and thought that this movie was NOT cool for more than half of the show, and start thinking that it's BORING, and personally i don't like ""Signs"", so i was worrying that Shyamalan's flim is not good anymore.......

And right at the ending part of the movie, i know i'm wrong, TOTALLY wrong, i'm such a fool that thought he's not cool. i'm fool around by Shyamalan's trick again, it's much more than i expected and to be honest, the ending is something that i 've never thought of, and he's so sucessful that after watching the whole flim, i realize that there're indeed alot of hints had been given thru out, but i just can't get them by then...

I'd say that ""The Village"" can be highlighted as one of the Mr. Shyamalan finest works, expect the first half of the flim do not have a lot of good climax.",1100649600,,1337,4.276679841897233
2167737,1,B00064LJVO,"I really liked the ""sixth sense"" and I thought that ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"" were both pretty good, but I hated ""The Village"". The whole movie was pretty much an excuse for the ending and message of the movie. It was like he was at home and thought of a twist ending and then said, ""Okay. I've got the ending.... now how should I fill up the other two hours."" And the answer is - with nothing. I guessed the twist ending along time in advance, and even if you don't it's still not very good. The movie is filled with long ""artsy"" shots of random things like chairs sitting in a field, and it doesn't add to the movie at all. Shyamalan is on a downward spiral since nothing has topped ""The Sixth Sense"" and if his next movie is worse than this, I cannot be held responsible for my actions.",1100563200,,789,4.231788079470198
2167738,5,B00064LJVO,"Okay, here's what I think.  When The Sixth Sense came out a couple of years ago, it blew people away with its shocker ending and scary material.  It also pretty much made it impossible for another movie's ending to really blow people away, because now everybody's going to be looking for clues along the way.

Now The Village has come out. Being a movie by the same director, people obviously went into it expecting to be scared and blown away by a mega-twist ending.  Well guess what?  This movie is not really that scary.  Sure it's suspensful, but nowhere near as much as The Sixth Sense was.

In addition to that, people are totally bumed that the ending wasn't all that good.  But at the same time they watched the movie with the utmost attention to detail in order to pick up on any clues the director might have dropped along the way.  So my question is: how can you expect to be blown away when your doing everything in your power not to be?

Bottom line, this movie should be judged by itself, not by how good it is compared to the Sixth Sense.  I thought it was a great movie, despite the fact that it wasn't all that scary.  It had great cinematography and a chilling score that really added to the overall eerie quality of the setting.  Bryce Dallas Howard really shined in her film debut, and should be applauded.  So if you haven't yet seen this movie, rent it when it comes out, and just watch it.  Don't analyze every plot detail, and don't compare it to The Sixth Sense",1100563200,,1486,4.372262773722627
2167739,5,B00064LJVO,"People always try to evaluate Shyamalan films on the inevitable and anxiously awaited ""twist"" he has become so infamous for. In a sense, he's a director that has been typecast. Now, being someone who figured out ""The Sixth Sense"" from the teaser previews, and hence already knowing what the twist was to be in what is regarded as his best and most surprising flick, I've instead focused a lot more on the message. All of his films have them, from the almost inane ""for every good, there is a corresponding evil"" in ""Unbreakable"", to the more profound message of faith in ""Signs"".

One of this movie's twists is evident from the beginning. Elder Walker (William Hurt) is the founder and leader of a society of folks who have retreated from the violence of the modern world, and taken refuge in an agrarian paradise. However, all paths to paradise have a sacrifice, and the sacrifice in this particular one is the complete lack of modern medicine, a technology of the outside world. Having sworn never to go back, the Village Elders find themselves in a quandary when Lucius Hunt (Pheonix) is wounded in a brutal attack by Noah Percy (Brody), a savage but essentially retarded village boy, who shares Hunt's infatuation for Walker's blind but ever-so-aware daughter Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard - watch for more excellent work from this extremely talented actress). As Lucius and Ivy are regarded by the Elders as bedrock on which the future of the Village rests, particularly after the Elders pass away, a tough decision is made to send Ivy, with two male guardians (hardy Village boys), to the edge of the forest to seek the arcane and forbidden medicine to heal Lucius.

As a backdrop for the story, the forest surrounding the Village is the inviolate territory of ""those we don't speak of"", terrible monsters who wreak horrible retribution on any who enter. At the same time, small animals are turning up mutilated in the Village. Assumed to be the work of the monsters in the woods, this violent incursion into the Village by those who have essentially besieged it creates an ominous sense of foreboding and impending doom.

Some people went to see ""The Village"" expecting a horror film of sorts. The film is almost entirely a psychological drama, and the tension is purely psychological throughout. Perhaps its most profound point is when Ivy, on her way back with medicine, comes face to face with one of ""those we don't speak of"", supposedly impossible at this point in the film, and learns that even paradise breeds its own monsters.

It's a good film. It's even better if you watch it with your mind open, and not expecting to have a temporary lobotomy for 2 hours as in so many other films with no message, but a lot of eye popping effects. Any film that one either loves passionately or hates vociferously has to be one you should see ;-)",1100217600,6,2844,4.739393939393939

If you like fancy special effects and eye candy like that, this ain't your flick.

If you like a mystery that gradually unravels, that takes THOUGHT (shudder), that has a GREAT twist at the end, and that leaves an impression on you, this is your movie.

I don't usually write reviews, but I had to put in my mention for Night's brilliant piece, here.",1100131200,5,461,4.3882352941176475

Now that we know that the plot twists will be there, we examine his movies with great care.

Yet no matter how hard we try to figure out the plot, M. Night Shyamalan always makes us look like a sorry lot.

M. Night Shyamalan likes to scare us using different features, and this time it's creepy looking creatures.

With names like Sigourney Weaver, Adrian Brody and Joaquin Phoenix, if it's great performances you're looking for you'll certainly get your fix.

As for the plot it is meaningful and deep, even though it may cause you to miss a night's sleep.

The story revolves around a secluded and small town, where evil stuff starts going down.

As the film porgresses we get more pieces of the picture, and at the end we understand the whole fixture.

I have seen all of M. Night Shyamalan's films to date, and The Village doesn't dissappoint as it is also great.

2167743,3,B00064LJVO,"I waffle between the idea that this movie was truly disappointing, or was it actually okay but expectations were just too high.  I expected something completely different, but I guess that was M. Nights point. The overkill from the marketing makes it difficult to say whether or not it was any good. It is indeed pretty to watch, but it just has this very phony feeling to it. There are not any really scary moments, and I had to laugh at the mysterious red caped creature which immediately brought to mind  Nicolas Roeg's murderous dwarf in ""Don't Look Now"".  I also think the directors affection for casting himself is really quite distracting. M. Nights other films were much more entertaining and seem to stick with you. This one is easily forgotten.",1099958400,7,754,4.740458015267175
2167744,3,B00064LJVO,"Well. If you have seen Sixth Sense, Signs, and Unbreakable, you will know how Mr. Shamalyan's mind works: create a reality, and when the viewer has got used to it, change it. Then change it again by the ending.

Not a bad formula, you've seen it working miracles in the aforementioned movies. But now, when i heard the premise (""in a 19th century village, people are being killed by monsters""), the ending flashed in my mind without effort. Of course i won't tell you the ending so i won't spoil you the only bit of fun that is in the movie.

The actors are amazing in their roles. They perform flawlessly the characters they have been given. But i'm a little upset at the director. There are too many long range shots (in order to show the isolation of the village) that waste the actor's faces. Sometimes they are speaking about something meaningful and you only get a shot from the back of the character. The director abuses this method in order to point to the confussion that the character is experiencing, but it gets on your nerves after a while. It didn't scare me, it just irritated me. Wonderful performances wasted by bad direction and editing. I'm sure that the ending could have been edited in order to reveal at once all the truths, and not in that dosified form that erases any hint of surprise or amazement to the viewer.

This is not the worst movie ever, certainly, but the most annoying thing is that it could have been actually a good movie. And it was spoiled.",1099785600,2,1481,4.4981412639405205
2167745,5,B00064LJVO,"Many reviews compare M. Night Shyamalan's The Village with The Sixth Sense. I think each of his movies should stand alone. So far, in my opinion, they've all been pretty good. The Village is no exception. You may see what's coming (as they say), but I think that's by design. Rather cleverly paced with the right information given at the right time, this story may or may not keep you guessing. Is it supposed to? Maybe not. Perhaps that's not the point. It might make you appreciate a kind of life lived in simpler times. Where modern day threats were not typically an issue. Where one felt safe in their community so long as they followed the rules. I found this very intriguing, and very entertaining. It's also somewhat sad. Such incredible sacrifices made. What drastic measures taken to live a pure, somewhat free existence. Brilliant. But with a price, as everything is. I'd definitely see this again.",1099785600,,908,4.753164556962025
2167746,4,B00064LJVO,"Like most people who saw this movie, I was first attracted by the nature of the trailer when it was first released.  Despite people claiming that the story wasn't really ""as advertised"" it was still an engaging film.  I remember being in the theater and being completely shocked when the plot turned not once, not twice, but three times.  Of course, I can't really state how this is because I don't want to ruin the story for those who haven't seen it yet.  Anyways, this is NOT a horror film, but quite a thriller.  I have never been in a theater where many of the viewers loudly gasped in shock.

Overall, I give this movie 4 stars, even though I am a little disappointed that the creatures were not seen more.",1099699200,,712,4.396946564885496
2167747,5,B00064LJVO,"To keep it short, the trailer was aimed at, litterally :), the Village People... not the viewer. Hence the big confusion. It was a quirky sense of humour and ended up biting its own tail. Anyway, this movie succeeds where Mr Michael Moore failed : It gives us a fabulous lesson under the form of a Fable. No pre-conceived ideas, no judgement whatsoever. Just another light on a dark situation.

Mr Night Shyamalan doesn't need a cliff-hanger kind of twist in the plot anymore. He scares the hell out of us just with everyday life. I call that an amazing success.. If he got such a maturity after 4 (or 5) movies.. I dread the next one.",1099526400,,635,4.427350427350428
2167748,5,B00064LJVO,"Once again a movie is a victim of its own marketing. Anyone who's seen the trailer for this movie is led to believe it's a story of a town besieged by giant man-eating creatures when in fact that is only the backdrop, not the plot. Many have unfairly judged this movie as been a bad episode of the Twilight Zone, as if Rod Serling had risen from the grave to pen one more tale. Others have mock it as being a copy of `Running Out of Time' by Margaret Peterson, but anyone who's read that book knows that the movie the Truman Show runs more parallels with that story then this movie. The only way that story and this movie are similar is in there being an adventure into the woods to fetch medicines.

It's not your fault though, you've been led to believe this will be a horror movie about trolls and what not, when all it really is is a love story. It's a tale of the limits a town is willing to go to protect its innocence. Not only that but the sacrifices, hardships, and dangers that one would willfully face all in the name for those they love. But if you judge this movie on the fact that it was not the movie you thought you were going to see, then you're depriving yourself of seeing the great movie that it is.

It's a fairy tale of a blind girl that finds true love and is willing to go to any length to save her love on one end and what a town is willing to do to protect it's self from the evils of the world on the other. This really is a beautiful movie done very skillfully and delightful to see. You'd see this to if you didn't go into the theater with assumptions or expectations.

This was the equivalent of seeing an advertised ghost movie that turned out to be about a guy trying to get a job at a funeral home. The website is no better, it only fuels the charade. The only way you can molest an audience further is switching and promising a love story that turns out to be a horror movie.

This isn't the first time they've miss-marketed a M. Night Shyamalan movie. Unbreakable was advertised as an action movie and Signs lead you to believe it was a movie about aliens invading. Signs was not about aliens invading (that was the backdrop/setting maybe even subplot), it was about a preacher questioning his faith after his wife is killed, HELLO ANYBODY HOME MISTER MARKETERS. Its funny how the marketers make you think that the backdrop of the movie (such as aliens invading or a town besieged by monster) is the plot. Like most of Hollywood they never seem to learn their mistakes and only continue them.

But in their defense, M. Night Shyamalan does not make the kinda movies that you can market easily. He makes films with simple plots that do have a hard time standing by themselves these days. Who wants to see a movie about a ""Superhero"" who chooses love over a career as a football player (Unbreakable) or a Preacher that questions his faith? Boring films they would be and marketing has the challenge of selling (explaining) the plot of the movie. But if the backdrop is aliens invading then that something that is not to be missed. Evil monsters that threaten a town, that's the kinda movie that puts people in the theater. Simple plots are hard to sell to the public because they're probably been told before and the public always want something new and different. Cinderella is getting a little old and people won't pay attention to it anymore unless it's told the same way but with the backdrop being different (like have a loud Greek family).

But on that same token the formula of having a basic plot with a fantastic backdrop is not a new thing nor uncommon. It's not something they haven't done it before and have no excuse for mucking it up. Love in the middle of a big war (English Patient) or love in the middle of a disaster (Titanic) is the order of the day. And in every one of those movies, the marketing was not deceptive. Titanic led you to believe it `was' a love story with a disaster as the setting. They showed you what you thought you were going to see. They didn't cheat and they didn't try and sell you a different movie because of their incompetence. The Village marketing team was advertising for a different movie. They advertised for a movie that was about a town being attacked by monsters and that's not what the village was about. Shame on them for ruining a good movie.

2167749,5,B00064LJVO,"Many people have reviewed this film, either as professionals or novices. And there are many superficial factors that have determined their opinions. I.E. The special effects could have been better, the movie seemed slow moving, the ""twist"" ending was no surprise"", etc. But, noone has of yet talked about the ""deeper meaning"" if you will, of the film.

The film, has many other demensions of meaning than what is on the surface. I don't want to give anything away to those who have not seen it. But, there are clear deeper paradoxes to our fears that have nothing, on the surface, to do with the movie.

Take the theory that this depicts the similarities of the film, to the control that most organized religions have on their members.

Most organized religions, use the fear of falling from the graces of God if we don't follow their version of the ""heavenly"" truth. The stipulations on their members, for the most part are to live a certain way, using man made ""rules"" often not even based on the Bible to live by. When those same ""rule makers"" cannot live by them. But, also imbedding fear in their members that what they are saying is in fact, ""the word of God."" When in reality that it is the ""word of man."" And using that embedded fear to control the members into doing and believing whatever they are told.

And in many cases, around the world, is also the tactics of many governments to control their ""members"" using fears that are imbedded and even fabricated to do so.

The meaning gets lost in the eyes of some who have veiwed this film on a superficial level. And not on a philosophical level.

So far every one of M. Night's films have had some deeper meaning than they first appear to have.

And some people have chosen to judge the film based on these first impressions. And not seeing the deeper meaning that is so clearly depicts.

Maybe for some, this film is too deep for their minds to grasp.

It plays on one our deepest fears. The denial of a safe eternity, based on the opinions of a few who took charge and used fear to corral the rest of us like cattle.

Or even on the human level of denial of our rights and desires as human beings. Based on the opinion of a few elite.

The fear of becoming robots of our own society, therefore forever altering our own destiny.

This is what's scary about this film. And even though it may not be as dramatic as some of his other films.

It may take a more subtle approach to that fear.

But that is how this kind of fear and control manifests itself in us. Cults are very subtle in their brainwashing techniques.

They could not gather more follows if they were in your face.

It takes time. It is done slowly and subtly.

And at the same time, remember it is just a movie. And people should keep this in mind.

Don't put down something if you don't understand it.

Film making is not an easy task. There are alot of things to consider and do when working on such a large project.

Sometimes films are not meant to amaze us or special effect us to death. They require alittle more thought.

This film was a film for the mind, not the eyes.

See it for what it is.

If you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, you might enjoy mocking this feature. In fact, I intend to rent the DVD just for that reason. Indeed, there is a lot to make fun of.

The writing is sloppy, with the dialogue stilted and forced. At times I was completely embarrassed for the characters when I heard what came out of their mouths. We burst out laughing at many of the more serious lines. Too many scenes are painfully awkward, whether that was intentional or not. Although sometimes the actors do very well with what little they had to work with, it was probably a mistake for them to take on this project at all.

The plot ""twist"" is insulting and predictable. When a movie is made solely for the benefit of the twist ending, then how good can it be? In fact, there are two---the first comes too early, and once it's revealed, it only makes the second more obvious.

Night plays with our emotions pretty well in some of the more ""romantic"" scenes, which are not many. The scares are also few and far between, and cheaply done. The rest of the movie drags, and in taking a restroom break I found I missed nothing.

Lastly, Night's ""cameos"" are becoming so blatantly arrogant and out of place in his films that I dread their appearance and cringe all the way through them.

I have read a few reviews about this movie and yes yes yes... we all know...this movie is NOT The Sixth Sense...sheeesh... what do you expect? You expect this movie to be that??...you wouldn't like that either!!

With that said....

As the movie begins, we are introduced to a group of people, fed up with the way the world is, have retreated to a small area within a woods in hope of restoring things to a more simple way of life... but how much simpler could you get for the 18th century??

M. Night introduces us to this little community that not only enjoys this rather basic life style but have found themselves trapped by creatures that surround the perimeter of the village...but seem to have grown quite used to it. They are bound by a few rules: 1. Let the bad color (red) not be seen, it attracts them.  2. Never enter the woods, this is where they wait.  3. Heed the warning bell, for they are coming.  ...And they do.

Joaquin Phoenix's character suggests that they need medical aid for the sick ones within the group. If only the elders of the community would permit him to venture into the woods to do this, sickness and possible death could be prevented.

But strange things are beginning to happen. Dead, skinned animals are found within the villiage. Have the creatures come into their space? Did someone disobey the rules?  All that is known is the creatures will attack if the rules are not followed.

When one of the villagers becomes deathly ill, it becomes imperitive the woods must be entered!

...and so we begin to get scared!

DISLIKES?

I totally enjoyed the movie. I hate the reviews!  They have all jumped on the band wagon of complaint for M. Night!  He is our Rod Serling!  He totally threw us with The Sixth Sense back in 1999...and we loved it. But now everyone expects him to throw us, even though we enter into the movie being detectives to try NOT to be thrown!! And then we complain we that he didn't do it. UUUGGGGHH!!! People are stupid...and like I said UNFAIR!!! Night, with that kind of pressure, still is able to put together a very entertaining movie. And guess what folks?? I guessed how it would end...right from the beginning...but I only guessed a part of it.  And even though I guessed the one part, I still totally enjoyed the movie. WHY?? Because there is more than a surprise twist ending from Night's films. There is heart, compassion, fear, hate and love.  I have seen it twice and will be the first to by the DVD.

LIKES?

Night always gives us a little and we fill in the rest along the way.  This film continues that tradition.  We think we know whats going on...but at last, we only know a bit.  Reviewers have complained about the acting...I had no problem with it. I did wonder if Night would make his cameo. That is done well too.  I also enjoyed that even though the movie is advertised as a demonic evil that would engulfs the villagers lives, I am glad to say there is nothing demonic at any level in this film. Actually, you will laugh at yourself after you have seen it.

RECOMMEND?

If you enjoyed: Night's other films - you will enjoy this one.

If you only liked The Sixth Sense - go watch Unbreakable again, and appreciate the depth of detail...and give the man a break.",1098662400,6,3392,4.471544715447155
2167755,5,B00064LJVO,If you went into this movie expecting a gross out scary movie you most likely hated it.  But the movie ended up being a smart somewhat scary movie (the only scary part was when the creature ran at howard and it was because of the music).  I thought the main story of the movie was a love story more than a scary one.  Joaquin Phoenix was amazing in the movie and so was Bryce Dallas Howard suprisingly.  Even though I guessed the ending it still surprised my friends and I still thought it was good even though I guessed it.  If you like Night's other movie's you'll most likely like this one too.,1098316800,5,597,4.247787610619469
2167756,2,B00064LJVO,"THE VILLAGE is perhaps reminiscent of an old Twilight Zone episode except that there's no Rod Serling to provide the laconic and wryly humorous introduction.

The American village in question is set in the depths of a forest, apparently in the late 19th century. At first, it seems an idyllic settlement. But we soon learn that the trees harbor monsters that will ostensibly assault anyone foolish enough to venture beyond the well-defined (with torches and yellow flags) town perimeter into the undergrowth. As long as the human inhabitants stay within the prescribed limits, and don't allow the display of anything colored red - even flowers - the goblins will tolerate their presence according to some unspecified ""truce"". The community is ruled by a council of elders, chief among whom are Edward Walker (William Hurt) and Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver). It's apparent the burg needs to chill out, perhaps with the help of a pub or two and a house of ill repute.

The film's lead female character is Ivy Walker, appealingly played by Bryce Dallas Howard. Ivy is the blind, yet wise and plucky, young woman that falls for the lumpish and taciturn Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix). After the latter falls afoul of the village idiot, Noah Percy (Adrien Brody), and his knife, Ivy volunteers to traverse the dreaded wilderness to the next town for the medicines that will save her beloved. (Why nobody from a neighboring town ever travels to the home village is ever explained.) It's on this quest that the audience discovers the true nature of the village and its besiegers.

The morale of the story is that Man's fears can be self-created, yet can be otherwise useful in keeping the population at large in psychological thrall, like the Red Menace of the Cold War era reported by the government to be poised to rape Mom and pillage the apple pie of the Free World, or the Bogey Man under the bed postulated by parents to keep unruly offspring under control.

Admittedly, the ending to THE VILLAGE did cause me to slightly raise an eyebrow in deference to a mildly clever twist, but the lead-up to it was too long and unengaging to ultimately justify the viewing experience.",1098316800,3,2171,4.84366576819407
2167757,5,B00064LJVO,"I really liked this movie, and I was hoping of course that it would be different than The sixth sence and the other movies of this director, and so it was. Don't get me wrong here, I adored The sixth sence and his previous work, but one should not repeat himself, and here you have a brand new plot in the same solid style. Not creepy? I thought it was rather creepy at times, and the director absolutely has the talent and gifth to capture the attention of the viewer, I did not want this movie to end though I was really curious to understand what was going on inside the woods around the village.

I love the idea behind The village. Not realistic? So what, with a few flaws this movie is done extrememly well. The monsters are scary, the atmosphere of the movie is as mysterious as I hoped for, and I can't understand why so many people didn't like it. I am looking forwards to his next project.

2167758,1,B00064LJVO,"This movie was complete crap.  I love Shyamalan.  He is a very talented director.  Let me emphasize, D-i-r-e-c-t-o-r.  He can't write a movie that doesn't have the inevitable ""twist"".  Which, i can understand, realizing his fantastic debut.  Also, his promising followup, Unbreakable (one of my favorite films) and certainly one of the greatest comic book movies of all time.  Signs was very enjoyable, a unique take on a global domination (the twist was unnecessary, but it did help propel the story along nicely).

However, The Village was a complete failure.  I guessed the ending just from the trailer (by the main characters sisters use of the contraction ""don't"").  It had some nice directing, and one amazing character (adrien brody - in a hopeful preview of the joker in the sequel to nolan's Batman Begins).  The editing was poor and the story worse.  Complete borefest.  It was one of the more painful experience in a movie this year I had, and that's saying a lot this year (King Arthur).  Don't get me wrong, this year was fantastic (Spider-Man, Harry Potter, Collateral), but what the hell was Shyamalan thinking?  Boring through and through, not interesting, predictable, and crap crap crap.

After, I was done watching this I ran home to watch Unbreakable just to remember that he really could make a movie.  Next time I hope he treats us to a real ""twist"" and gets a separate writer for his excellent directing.",1097971200,,1427,4.879166666666666

Not many people have herd of that movie but it shows how good he is as a director. So this is a must see.

M. Night will continue making great movies like this. He is extremely talented. Unlike the guy who said M. Night is dumb and don't know how to make movies.",1097798400,4,619,4.201680672268908

I think they had to make the previews misleading in order to keep the outcome a complete secret.  I was expecting something totally different from what was happening and was totally surprised at the end.  That's the way it should be.  Signs was advertised to make the film look a bit scary, but you find that the story is more about faith than aliens... a wonderful surprise that, just like The Village, left me with a ""wow"" feeling as the credits began to roll.

2167761,3,B00064LJVO,"I have to say that I do not like particularly scary movies. But the idea of the film sounded great. A little community isolated, surrounded by a forest and with threatening creatures living in. The film is correct. Shyamalan knows what he is doing and also, let's face it, he has his own peculiar style. But in spite of some moments when I jumped from my seat, I think the idea of the film is again a game with us, poor viewers being teased by the director.

I like the part  of the film when the life in the village is depicted, but unfortunately it is too short. The characters are too bi-dimensional. And also too stereotypical. The blind girl who can see what others cannot, the leader of the community, the represion in which all of them are living.

Personally I think that the critic of fear as a way to manipulate  people is very interesting; but this idea vanishes as long as we are put in the middle of a regular fairy tale. The girl pursued by the big bad woolf, the woods as the primal source of fear, and an end that is shocking only for a moment.

The director has created a beautiful package for an irrelevant story. The locations, the colors and the music just wrapped something that is a project of what could have been an inetresting film.",1097539200,,1257,4.354700854700854

The trailer is very misleading, however genius. By viewing the trailer alone, this movie looked fantastically creepy and horrifying....this little 19th century village isolated and surrounded by woods where something lurks....Unfortunately, the movie takes a different twist and ruins it. Don't get me wrong...I never saw the twist coming and it was definitely interesting, I was just expecting a diffrent kind of movie....the one portrayed in the trailer would've been one heck of a thriller.",1097539200,4,748,5.131147540983607

At the end of the movie there was nothing but boos coming from the crowd. On the other hand the budget for this film was low so M banked a huge profit for his effort. Good business.

2167766,2,B00064LJVO,"I was personally very disappointed in ""The Village"".  This film follows the template of all of Shamaylan's films: a constant feeling of unease that never goes anywhere, and ends underwhelmingly.  After seeing the trailers for ""The Village"", I was expecting to be scared out of my mind.  The trailers made the film out to be terrifying, so I walked into the theater expecting to watch the film through my fingers, curled into a fetal position on my chair.  However, that was not the case.  The first half hour or so was scary  la Signs, but then it seemed to spiral downhill from there.  It reminded me of a Scooby Doo episode, in all honesty.  The plot itself was fairly clever, with a bizarre twist that left me pondering the idea of a sequel, but what would be the point?  It's likely that nobody would go see the sequel and it would flop horribly, because by the end of the movie, nobody really cared about the 'fate' of the village.  All in all, I was pretty disappointed in the film.  It built up suspense, but it never went anywhere; it was merely a feeling of discomfort that eventually went away, and was replaced with disappointment.",1097366400,,1142,4.549019607843137

2167768,5,B00064LJVO,"This is by far the best movie of the year and people that hate it just don't understand it. For the past 5 years M. Night Shyamalan has brought us shocking and original films that have frightened us and made us think about life and things we care for most. And Night's films are always dramatic with suspenseful moments. The Sixth Sense taught us about life, Unbreakable showed us that we should go out and do what God planned for us to do, and Signs shows us that everything happens for a reason.

The Village shows us what happens when we try to protect those we love the most. And also what someone would do to save the person they truly love. M. Night Shyamalan really shines in this film. Jaquin Pheonix plays in his best acting job yet as a young boy destined to help the people of his village by planning to venture out into the forbbiden woods. Bryce Dallas Howard is what I can see to become the next big actress. She was phenomenal as Ivy Walker. Adrien Brody plays a very intresting mentaly disabled man. Other village members and great performances include William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Cherry Jones, Brenden Gleesen,Judy Greer, and the rest of the elders.

The Music to the film is one of the best scores I have ever heard in my entire life. James Newton Howard does a great job. Roger Deakins lighting was spectacular aswell.

SIDE NOTE:Do NOT go see this film OR complain this film if you are wanting to get scared out of your skin. Movie Trailer NEVER make a movie look how it really is. The Village is being looked at by everyone as a Horror slasher film. In fact it is a Romatic Horror film. But it is very dramatic, with SOME frightening sequences. This film is just amazing. And I don't believe people are really giving this film or M. Night Shyamalan a real chance. The movie will be out soon and I hope everyone at least rents it so they can experience this great work of storytelling.",1097280000,6,1909,4.433048433048433
2167769,3,B00064LJVO,"I was very impressed with the feel of the movie. It made me feel exactly the way the movie was supposed to make you feel,with a sense of peace,hope,tranquility,and no worries, a place that we all want to go when this world that we live in is going the way or is the way it is. But as we know, I don't think there can be quite a place like that without fear,death,and everything that is opposite of light or good. I thought the ending was cool, but it didn't have you saying oh my gosh with excitement as in Signs or The Sixth Sense. You know the suspence with Signs and The Sixth Sense was frighting. The little girl never finishing her water and wondering why,and then finding out in the end that it was there to destroy the alien, that was excellant story telling by the director. How about finding out Bruce Willis was a ghost all along,excellant. The Village had these components in them but not as strong. Still a good movie, but not his best.

2167770,5,B00064LJVO,"A very pleasant surprise, The Village, brings to the screen exactly what the title implies: the story of a remote village along with its inhabitants!

But that is not all; it deals with concepts such as Crime, Tradition, Good and Evil, as well as Change and Progress.  Most importantly, it brings attention to and succeeds in making people aware of the existence of Protestant fundamentalists and the sheer power of manipulation.

Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least. The plot, the setting, the dialogues, and the costumes are all wonderful!

The Village is a very good movie, guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment.  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.

As is the case with the director's other major movies, M. Night Shyamalan has not lost his touch in providing an unexpected ending.

Overall, it is a movie definitely worth watching; after Signs, The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and The Others, M. Night Shyamalan has scored another major hit with The Village!",1097280000,3,1148,5.010526315789473
2167771,4,B00064LJVO,"I didn't know what to expect from 'The Village' when I went to see it, because M. Night Shyamalan is an uneven filmmaker. I thought 'Sixth Sense' was quite haunting and well-made, if outrageously predictable. 'Unbreakable' was unbelievably slow and aimless. 'Signs' was far and away his best movie, a fantastic thriller that was both haunting and moving.

The director asks a lot of an audience by putting his name over the title, which builds everyone up to expect they will have their jaws hitting the theater floor with his ""twists"". But, I think, far more than any twist he could ever contrive, his movies are about faith and the power of love conquering all. Those themes, which are woven throughout all his films, are much stronger and more interesting than any zinger ending.

It was fun to just give into the odd pacing and ambiance of 'The Village'. Even though the ""secrets"" had me thinking ""oh brother"" when revealed, I thought the love story between Joaquin Phoenix (always a brilliant actor) and Bryce Dallas Howard (the best young actress in recent memory) was exquisite in it's portrayal. Just giving in to the ""Twilight Zone"" twists and turns, to be rewarded with a sublime love story, was satisfying and refreshing.

What truly amazed me was the harsh reception this movie received with the critics. Normally thoughtful and literate critics, namely Roger Ebert, eviscerated this movie and completely missed the point. Only Peter Travers of Rolling Stone got the point when he wrote...""In crafting a film about the ways fear can manipulate ... Shyamalan gives the film a metaphorical weight that goes deeper than goose bumps.""

It is a political allegory that we should all heed. I highly recommend looking past its faults and giving this movie a chance.",1097107200,9,1770,4.929530201342282

Now i don't want to get on the bad sides of everyone who liked this film, i guess it must depend on your taste, but i thought this film really sucked. I wasn't really expecting much though, and i wasn't given much so it all worked out pretty even. The storyline was weak and lame. The 'monsters' weren't scary at all and the moments that were trying to build up to being scary just didn't work. Whats up with the fact that those two people that are getting married spoke like two lines to each other and then decided to get hitched? what the!

2167777,3,B00064LJVO,"That this can be M. Night Shyamalan's least effective film to date, yet still a reasonably good one, says a lot for the young man's talent.  It's superbly shot, cunningly edited, beautifully scored, and has a wonderful cast of established (though oddly stilted) stars and a startlingly good newcomer in Bryce Dallas Howard.  The problem, surprisingly, is the screenplay.  Usually it's the brilliant linchpin of Shyamalan's work, but this one wears its post-9/11-""love conquers all"" subtext just a little too showily on its sleeve, and spends way too much of the first hour setting up a sweet but lugubrious romance when, true to the trailer, it might have been better if it was scaring the pants off us.  Of course, there's nothing wrong with a movie that refuses to pander to audience expectations.  ""Signs"" pulled that trick brilliantly - an ""aliens movie"" that ended up having very little to do with aliens.  The trick to making that one work, however, was that for 90% of the film it WAS actually about aliens - not faith, serendipity and the interconnectedness of all things.  For 90% of ""Signs"" we were terrifyingly entertained.  For a large part of ""The Village"" we're teetering on the edge of boredom.  Perhaps the problem is simply that we're all finally learning how to watch Shyamalan's films: its very difficult to become thoroughly engaged in what happens in the first 80 minutes when you know it's all about to be spectacularly undone with a twist (or two).  This time around, when those moments come, they're handled with all the spine-chilling flair we've come to expect from Shyamalan, and you can't help smiling at how thoroughly you've been duped - yet again! - and the extraordinary imaginative power of the man behind it all.  I'll never get tired of those moments, especially when they're as beautifully realized as they are here - the editing of voice over, music and images is pure magic.  These moments make this kind of story worth telling.  See ""The Village"" by all means, but it's best if you DON'T expect horror and DO approach it with an open mind: kind of apt, I guess, given the hopeful political message Shyamalan's pushing this time around.  Leave your fear at the door.

Update, October 3: I've seen this film twice now, and it's far better the second time around - 4 stars.  When you aren't expecting to be frightened, the subtle tone of the first hour is much more readily appreciated, and really chimes with William Hurt's pronouncements on hope and love later in the film.",1096502400,5,2511,4.804651162790698

I could not believe they would let a movie as bad as this loose in the world. Do they think we, the audience, are that stupid? Well, judging from some of the reviews giving this dreck 5 stars, yeah.

I did actually doze off in the middle, it was that boring. Waited for the big scary climax: a guy dressed in a red robe with a rubber pig's mask. ZZZZZZZzzzzzzz, you see scarier stuff than that on ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" which is just about what this movie is.

This is an example of a director getting too much success too early: everything he does from then on he thinks is genius. Steven Spielberg, if you paid attention, made a lot of junk after ""Close Encounters."" The acting in ""The Village"" was terrible, stiff and dull as if the actors were as bored as the audience.

2167779,5,B00064LJVO,"I've seen all of Night's films. I thought Sixth Sense was excellent, didn't feel too much for Unbreakable and The Signs was too far-fetched. The Village ranks as my favourite above them all.

First, the story:

I watched the movie despite friends telling me that it wasn't worth it. I went into the theatre with an open mind, and took the story as it was told. It unfolded very smoothly and I completely understood it. It was good, and I thought in Hollywood where all movies were after all 'stories', this was a very good one told.

Second, The acting:

This was the best. The movie was carried very well by Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix. Both were very very good actors.

Direction: Shyamalan couldn't have been better. He exhibits the style of the sixth sense here - where the camera would move in directions only to lull you back to the original position to find something else.

Visuals: Cinematography and art direction was great, given the plot. It really made me 'believe'.

Overall: This is a good movie. I left still thinking of it. Amazing. How could one ever think of such a story?",1096416000,6,1103,4.596938775510204

Instead I watched a film with an amazing concept, an unexpected twist (shymalan's famous for his twists yet he always catches me by surprise) and a message with left me pondering and which is also open to interpretation.

This movie is not horror ... it's food for thought. If you haven't seen the movie yet go and watch it but ignore any trailer you have seen. You'll like it better this way. In a decade or two, i see this movie being considered a classic.",1096329600,3,757,4.220689655172414

We got it - halfly. It was a bit scary and had a bit twist ending - but not up to the standards that the 6th sense set before.

The atmosphere of the film and the direction is excellent. But that's all.

Anyone who wants to see monsters or a big twist in the end will be disappointed. I was.

There are silly things in the storyline that drove me mad when wathcing the film. I don't want to spoiler or anything, it's just silly and dull. But as I said, the direction is top-notch.

Though I didn't like it too much, it's not a bad film at all - there is a lot work and effort in it, just not my cup of tea.",1096156800,,676,3.8345323741007196
2167782,5,B00064LJVO,"When trailers for Shyamalan's new project started gracing the big screen, viewers were all probably asking the same question, ""Is this going to be as big as 'Sixth Sense'?"" M.Night Shyamalan is inextricably linked to his first work, the standard by which all of his other movies will inevitably be pulverized. Perhaps ""Sixth Sense"" should have been his final work, and then maybe viewers and critics would not complain so much about ""The Village"". The attacks on this new work reflect a lack of depth and breadth in critical consensus. Critics and consumers are entering the theatre with expectations that extend beyond genre. They are not willing to rate M.Night Shyamalan's work against all other thriller/suspense films. I would like to quote Michael Madsen's character Budd in Kill Bill, Vol. 2. ""When you compare a Hattori Hanso sword, you compare it to every other sword made by a man."" Rather than compare Shyamalan's work to everything else he has done (foul play), this critic will compare it to the standard set in other installments of the genre.

Unlike most suspense/horror films, ""The Village"" shows very little of the aggressors, Those We Do Not Speak Of (yes, the moniker ends on a preposition, so what? Where's the Harvard library at, BLEEP?) In fact, the camera shots on the whole are very minimalistic. This may drive most people batty, and that is the intent...prolonged tension. There is a great deal of warmth in the characters, which keeps the tension from becoming a source of frustration. The greatest center of warmth is newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard, who accounts for an easy ninety percent of the emotional punch of this film. Her talent far outweighs what her filmography may suggest. Howard steals the show with very little competition. Some may expect a larger presence from Joaquin Phoenix because of his pivotal character in ""Signs"", but he is decor compared to Hurt and Howard.

The cinematography is amazing because of its duality. On one extreme, it is the kind of trashy that you expect from a five-year-old taking snapshots of the backs of people's heads, and then it effortlessly flops into some of the most gorgeous juxtapositions of radiant colors. Shyamalan plays with color a lot more than some may dare, and the overall effect adds another dimension of spiritual tone.

The surprise ending is brilliant because it sneaks up on the viewer in such a way that it takes five minutes after the credits are done rolling to fully absorb the weight of what Shyamalan is trying to say with this film. He has a message. It's a message of hope and blinding paradoxes that exist in a very imperfect world. He weaves jealousy, murder, love, humor, fear, and sacrifice into a world of spiritual equilibrium where there is always a flipside. The point does not seem to be a lesson in ethics, but rather in how right and wrong also have a neutral spectrum that makes humans have to give their actions a second look in order to choose the optimal path.",1095984000,5,2978,4.846758349705304
2167783,4,B00064LJVO,"I think two factors are behind the bulk of negative reviews for ""The Village"": one, it's fairly obvious that M. Night Shymalan has gone into the well a few too many times in regard to his Big Twist plot scenario, and two, the film was wrongly advertised as a horror movie.

Perhaps my knowledge of these two facts was what let me enjoy the movie on a level that other people haven't; watching it as a dark fairy tale, a critique on today's contemporary situation, a beautiful love story, and a chilling suspense mystery. With gorgeous visuals, fantastic use of colour and a haunting violinist score, ""The Village"" is certainly a feast for the senses, whatever you might think of the actual story.

In an idyllic, peaceful clearing is a hamlet where children play together, adults work together, and which is benevolently ruled over by a group of Elders. Amongst them is Edward Walker, the village patriarch and school-teacher, widowed Alice Hunt, and bereaved father August Nicolson, who has just lost his son to illness.

The second generation is represented mainly through Edward's two daughters, the giddy Kitty, and the blind, spiritual Ivy, and Alice's son Lucius - a near-mute introvert who never speaks more than five words strung together unless he's carefully written out what he wants to say on a piece of paper. As well as this, there's Noah Percy, a mentally challenged young man who adores Ivy, and is consequently hurt and confused by her growing feelings for Lucius.

The village is surrounded by Covington Woods, and here is where the real chills are to be found. Inside these woods dwell what the villagers call ""Those We Don't Speak Of"", strange and menacing monsters that stand between the village and the outside towns. Not that this is a bad thing, as we are told that the towns are ""wicked places, full of wicked people"". Despite this, it is important that the villagers uphold the uneasy truce between the woods and their community. A series of defences are in place to keep the creatures at bay: watchtowers, warning bells, offerings, cloaks of ""the safe colour"" and a restriction against anything that is red - this apparently attracts them. And no one is *ever* to go into the woods.

But of course, we all know that anything forbidden is instantly fascinating, and that teenagers are almost genetically engineered to test the boundaries put in place around them. Therefore, whilst the other boys are playing ""chicken"" games at the edge of the woods, Lucius is exploring his own theory concerning the creatures: he is greatly affected by the death August's son, and believes that if the traveller had noble intentions (such as fetching medicines from the towns), the creatures would let him pass unharmed.

But as he puts this to the test, the threat from the creatures grow - skinned animals and red marks appear on the doors. Coincidence? No way. Rules are continually broken, and lines continually crossed throughout the story - even the angelic Ivy breaks her ""no hitting"" rule. Finally Lucius (and the rest of the youths) seem frightened enough to no longer attempt passage through the woods, until an accident occurs that forces a drastic decision to be made. Now Ivy must go through the terrible woods, in order to save the life of her beloved...

I know that the illogical plot-holes are so gaping that you could drive a truck through them, and I know that there are some serious problems with the final resolution, but there comes a point when you make a decision - to either go with it, or scoff at it. Most people it seems have taken the second option, and unfortunately they miss out on a lot of what the director is trying to tell us about fear, authority, rules, innocence and control - all of which have particular resonance in today's world. Whether you liked it or not, please ask yourself this: where does the real danger lie - in the woods, in the towns, or in the village itself? Are some of the choices made justified? Is retaining innocence worth the terror that goes with it?

As well as this, there are a lot of things to enjoy; the afore mentioned atmosphere, and the genuine scares that Shymalan throws in (at one particularly harrowing moment three girls behind me in the theatre screamed - and I mean really *screamed*). Most touching for me however, was the love story between Ivy and Lucius - every time she puts her hand out, he's there to take it, and their discussion on the porch is beautifully performed and shot: the silent Lucius suddenly blurts out what's on his mind, whilst the talkative Ivy is struck dumb.

There are some things however, that stopped me from giving it five stars, the biggest one being the sudden veer away from Lucius's plot development. Shymalan builds an interesting and endearing character, and then he abruptly drops from the action, never to return. This obviously had to happen in order to get Ivy into the woods, but we never *return* to his story. Ivy learnt some truths on her journey that she'll undoubtably share with him, but we never see how he'll react to them. For that matter, we never actually learn if Ivy was actually *successful* in her mission - does he survive or not?

All in all, I enjoyed ""The Village"", and I really hope you take the time to look deeper into what it's trying to say. Everything, from the colours invoked (red, the colour of violence to yellow, the colour of cowardice) to the poetic flow of the language - which is perhaps *meant* to be a little stiff, is there for a reason. Some great performances from the actors involved, and meticulous direction and control from Shymalan - I'm definitely getting this on DVD.",1095724800,75,5643,4.725609756097561
2167784,5,B00064LJVO,"First off, if you haven't seen the film yet, don't listen to any of the critics, see the film for yourself. I went to this film expecting only the signature Shyamalan plot twist. I wasn't disappointed.

  The acting is superb as is the casting, the lead however, goes to Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy Walker and Phoenix as Lucius Hunt. The script, the music, the cinematography are all excellent. The music especially is memorable for weaving an atmosphere of that gives you images of suspense, terror but it is also beautiful orchestral music. This film is undeserving of the bad reviews from viewers who were too narrow minded to enjoy this film for what it really is: a drama.

  I see this as Shyamalan's attempt at breaking out of the ""thriller"" genre that the superb ""The Sixth Sense"" has entombed him in. This is his introduction to his other talents at filmmaking. This is not a ""thriller"" or a run-of-the-mill horror film, this is a drama film laced with suspense. It is Shyamalans version of an emotional film with scenes of terror and suspense throughout. ""The Village"" shows us that the terror is not only in the unknown but in the things in our lives that we try to leave behind and also in the feelings that we keep hidden.

  Above all this film is about the innocence in us, and the means that some people will go to preserve it. If you want a film that makes you think, that will also scare you but one that is also eerie and hauntingly beautiful then you must see this film, it shows a whole new side to M. Night Shyamalan who is a filmmaker who must be known by more than his previous films.",1095724800,25,1607,4.438775510204081
2167785,4,B00064LJVO,"One's expectations have a lot to do with our level of enjoyment for many things. Having viewed all of Shyamalan's work from the ""The Sixth Sense' to ""Signs"", admittedly, my expectations were quite high in anticipation of ""The Village"".

Shyamalan's growing reputation as the master of the ""twist ending"", is well deserved. He's a good storyteller. So, when walking into the theatre to view his latest, though my expectation were high, I really didn't know what to expect, but I knew it would be original. After speaking with many people and reading reviews about the film, we either really liked it or really hated it. Personally, this film had me mesmerized from start to finish, and in the end, did not disappoint. It is dangerous to expect too much of anything, because more often than not, what we expect never pans out. I believe those that hated the film had, in some cases, preconceived notions about its content. ""The Village"" is not a ""monster"" movie, but a story about love, courage and predominately, fear. Fear is the picture's central theme; how fear can be used to control people, and the dire results that can come with exploiting fear to manipulate our hearts and minds.

Shyamalan is not only the master of the twist ending but he's a genius at creating the eerie atmosphere that in turn creates deep suspense. He certainly had the audience jumping in their seats from time to time. In some ways, he used his talent as a storyteller in this film to manipulate the audience with fear to then reinforce the film's theme, that fear can be used to manipulate us in life. This was very clever, almost too clever.

It is impossible to write about the plot without spoiling it for those who haven't yet seen the film. Let me just say that it is highly original. The performances from all the cast are first rate, particularly the character, Ivy, played by Bryce Dallas Howard. William Hurt also did a fine job.

Good advice would be to see this film without too many expectations, erase from your minds any preconceived notions, and simply sit back and view it for what it is. Although not Shymalan's best work, in my opinion, it is one of his better efforts.",1095379200,3,2169,4.670157068062827
2167786,2,B00064LJVO,"Okay, here's your warning: SPOILER ahead. Alright with you? Then read on:

As I sat watching this film, I was unpleasantly reminded of the Bruce Willis flick, ""Unbreakable"", where the villain turned out to be the disabled freak in the wheelchair, proof evidently that crippled bodies cause crippled development, whether emotional or moral. Sure enough, I go home and see what else the filmmaker for ""The Village"" had done, and up pops ""Unbreakable"". Perhaps if I were to see a third film by M. Night I would find a similar strand again, but I'm going to do my darndest to avoid seeing such a third film by this person, who seems to want to make this point over again.

""The Village"" is a little like the town of Walnut Grove in ""Little House on the Prairie""--gingham and such. What's a bit different from the norm is that this Village has a mandate against a few things, like wearing red or going outside the set boundaries. This is to avoid meeting up with a creepy force surrounding the Village. Basically, the plot concerns how the rising generation feel steps should be taken to venture into that no-man's land to make contact with the outside world for health supplies, etc. Much as you might expect, things turn dangerous before The Surprise Climax of the film occurs.

Good points? Yes, the film has good atmosphere and great cinematography, which many of the reviewers note. Good performances by ""elders"" William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver.

Bad points? Besides what I mentioned up front about demonizing the disabled character in the film, another thing that stretched belief was making Joaquin Phoenix and Adrien Brophy of the ""Young'uns"" generation. Okay, they're not as old as the hills or anything, but c'mon, they're not teenagers either. Jake Gyllenhaal would have been better casting for the Joaquin character, for instance.

While I could see The Surprise Climax coming, others of my acquaintance maintain they were astounded at the development. Just depends on how much you read or seen about ""isolated societies"" themes.

To sum up, it's discouraging to see how a movie like ""The Village"" takes us all back not just a few steps but several centuries in attitudes about the disabled and ""blame"" for bad events. Hopefully, these old prejudices won't creep into the subconcious minds of young people viewing something like this.",1095292800,,2343,4.9189873417721515
2167787,2,B00064LJVO,"As far as I know, M. Night Shyamalan's lateset film 'The Village' has gathered as much (deserved) complaints as the cash from the unsuspected audiences -- with the boxoffice tickets exceeding $100 m. -- and I am one of those who were not impressed with his trademark 'surprise.'

As this 'surprise' in case is the part which vastly disappointed us, it is hard to explain why this is a huge letdown.  I only say this; you will surely be 'surprised' at the ending, but probably not in the pleasant way when you see a first-rate magicians.  The truth is, the surprise is made for the sake of 'surprise' only, nothing else.

Well, the film starts with a very somber tone.  So somber that you easily accept the apparently contrived situations.  That is like, you see people in 'The Village,' perhaps New England or somewhere like that, and the time is unspecified but looks like 100 years ago.  No detailed explanations are given at first except their peculiar lifestyle.  For example;

They live very quietly, observing the religious ceremony;

They prohibit the color red (which brings something bad, they think);

and they are very afraid of the woods nearby.  But why?

As you see, the secrets would be all revealed.  One blind girl Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard, Ron Haward's daughter) is the key to the revelation, who falls in love with a laconic man Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix).

Now, to be fair, the director has not lost the power to create the spooky feelings, greatly helped by the camera of Roger Deakins (famous for Coen Brothers' films).  I found the acting is all so-so, including Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Brendan Gleeson, Michael Pitt, and Adrien Brody.  But to be frank, I thought Ms. Howard needs more training.  Ivy is supposed to be blind but she doesn't look like that -- she is clearly seeing things, and that is not as the blind people do.

There are so many hints, or signatures, which suggest something sinister, and something creey, all over the film, and they are pretty interesting until the end of the film.  And  everything loses its credible power when you see the truths, which are too impossible and laughable too.  See it, and check it, but that's after you rent it.",1095120000,,2207,4.722513089005235
2167788,4,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan has a reputation of making different, thrilling movies, with endings that would leave the collective jaw of the audience hanging. He seems to enjoy that reputation, and it seems that, at least in the near future, all his films will be like that. I think differently. Shyamalan's movies are usually really slow (on the verge of being boring) stories with a good/very good plot twist at the ending, that makes the viewers forget how the movie drags for at least ninety minutes without much happening before the ""unforseen ending"".

I may be shallow, but it works for me. I don't think the indian director is amazing, but an average guyr with a few good ideas and problems concerning the plot development of his stories. ""The sixth sense"" was indeed very good, and it may be difficult for Shyamalan to best that one. ""The village"" is in the same level with ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"": slow movies that use more than an hour to ""build the tension"" and to establish a goal to the viewers, leading to the surprising ending.

In the present case, the tension comes from the woods that surround a tiny village during the end of the nineteen century. In those woods live a bunch of strange, super-sized creatures that respond (negatively) to the red color. There's nothing red in the village, not a single red flower, clothes, or barn. Red is the bad color. Then, something happens (I won't say what because it is sort of a plot twist in itself) and a handicapped person has to travel through the woods in order to retrieve something that is necessary to the well-being of the entire village.

Reading the above paragraph, it becomes clear that the plot has some holes, and, after the ending, the many seemingly incongruent parts of the story are not sewn nicely together, as they were in ""The sixth sense"", for example. What is worse, acting is pretty lame, except for Bryce Dallas Howard, an unknown actress to me until now, but very talented. And I hadn't seen Lieutenant Ripley, I mean, Sigourney Weaver, in such bad acting before. William Hurt is also not very good, something like Dr. Robinson with an ancient accent. Even Adrien Brody is irritating.

In the end, the ""surprise"" worked on me. It really did. I will not say that I guessed it before the time, because I didn't. And I think it was a big plot twist, and a very good one. When the credits rolled, I thought it was funny that red was the bad color.

2167789,2,B00064LJVO,"If ""Signs"" may have hinted at Shyamalan being a one-trick pony, ""The Village"" only clinches the suspicion.

The film is painfully uncertain of what it wants to be: a swooning love triangle, or an otherworldly thriller with Shyamalan's usual bag of iffy tricks, or a metaphorical trope on the mores of modern day society and its culture of fear.

Fortunately, that barely matters, because half-way through we are much too wrenched to bother. Shyamalan hasn't lost his eye as a story teller, and to be fair, there are about two moments where music and cinematography blend into a pitch-perfect startling moment.

But cheesy dialogue abounds, and an hour into the movie we're still being introduced to characters in the past, none of which really amount to much until the end. It's a lesson in how to take well known stars of the cadre of Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, William Hurt, etc., and give them micro-minor scraps of roles to get by on. Such frittering of talent.

As for the theme, the lesser said the better.  While the first half is simply laborious, the second steps up to the plate and defies all imaginable logic. The biggest hole, why could one of the supposed senior folks not go to the ""towns"" if a life was at stake? Why did a blind woman have to be sent simply because she would be ""led by love"".

Just had to leave my opinion. I was suprised to read so many bad reviews when I first heard of ""The Village"". So naturally, I just had to see it. It was like Blade, that had really bad reviews, and when I saw it, I loved it. Of course that was a few years back.

Anyway, the review.

I really liked it. I am also one of those who did not enjoy the Sixth boring sense. However I did enjoy Unbreakable. Its hard to compare this movie to any other without actually ruin the ending. It doesnt take a genius to figure out that there is going to be a big twisted ending. Never the less, that was the good part of the movie, because I was really trying to figure out for myself what it would be, and in the end, in the very end I was like: OH WOW!! GOOD ONE!!

I think that the reason why a lot of people don't like it, is because the story isn't really that interesting, it is just a kind of a build-up for the surprises. The new actress whats her name, was cool. I really look forward to enjoy more flicks with her. She has got a sertain look.

The only thing i really didn't like, was that even thou she was convincing in her role, I really didn't think she was blind. You kinda get very early that she is blind, but as blind as she was, she had a lot of ""seing moments"" it welt like.

Anyway, words really cant explain ""The Village"". Dont believe the hype, and enjoy a movie with an interesting twist. At least try to figure out the twist if you think its boring otherwise. I think its a hell of a challange to figure out the ending.

At this task, he does a masterful job.  Watch the movie and expect everything to mean something, because it does.

The suspense and fear are there because he wants you to feel the reality that there is really something ""other"" out there, something worth being afraid of.

""Signs"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"", these films are as simple as they get, they scar us, they give us twists and turns, but not stupid twists like ""The Village.""

2167796,3,B00064LJVO,"There was quite alot of negative feedback coming from  some of the most high profile reviewers on this film and it was with this information that i be-grudgling entered a cinema complex to see it. I must say outright that here is another lesson in going in with low expectations and being pleasently surprised.

I really liked this film !!!!

This movie is not a bad film and has alot of redeeming features that seem to allow one to be both intrigued and consumed with what un-folds on the screen.

So what the hell does this mean ????

WELL, starting with the acting......all performances in this movie are quite good with the stand out performance of Bryce Dallas Howard. Im not goping to say she is like the next Meryl Streep or anything but her performance was a stand out and i really liked her character. She was able to project some spunk into the role which gave the character the ability to have some charisma for the viewer watching. She won't win an Oscar but for her first movie she stood out; even among the more seasoned actors.

It was great to see William Hurt ( a classically good actor) and Siqourny Weaver, as i just happen to like them both.

Joaquin Phoenix did his best but came across abit too aloof. I realise his character is broody and distant but he came across a bit retarded at time.

I found the love story aspect between him and Bryce Howard a bit meh !!!!!

Ok, now the movie itself....I did enjoy the tension in the first half, the suspense and story arc overall. The film, as stated by others, should not have been publisised as a horror movie but as a period, suspense film. Maybe it was and we have just interpertated it as horror????

Maybe our expectations of what this directors should provide us is too narrow???

Do we only want copies of The Sixth Sense or do we want something orginal and fresh???

Shyamalan's films are all very much like extended episodes of the Twilight Zone and it is best to view each movie as a seperate experience. Anyone expecting Signs to be like the Six Senth was disappointed and anyone expecting this to be Signs will be crushed.

I love this mans work so far and The Village is a good movie that will only let down those that have expectations of a monster film.

Now to finally look at what is seen as the 'Shaylmalan Twist' (if its a Shaylmalan movie we seem to always expect a twist. Poor guy is going to be thinking overtime on all his films to provide the audience with that twist).In writing about the twists i do not reveal plot details so as not to ruin the experience but guide u to what u should expect. ......There are 3 moments of the film that twist it into a new direction based on 1: an incident 2: information shared between father and daughter and 3: exposure of the inner workings of the Village itself. These 3 moments of the film will shock and engage some viewers while leaving others disappointed and angry that what they in-visoned as a monster film is anything but. I am not giving away anything by stating this and hope infact that it gives you a better way to approach the film -This IS NOT A MONSTER FILM.............I think people's disappointment comes from expecting the film to be like Aliens mixed with the Blair Witch.

2167797,5,B00064LJVO,"This is not some gory, 'slasher' type film. Think suspense. Think Alfred Hitchcock. (Especially when M. Night Shyamalan has a cameo role.) He tells a masterful tale set back in the 1800s of a village who lives peacefully except for a fear of the creatures who live within the surrounding woods. When domestic animals come up slain and red marks (the forbidden color that attracts the creatures) start showing up on resident's front doors, the elders begin to wonder if the uneasy truce between them and the creatures beyond is about to be broken.

This village has certainly had it's share of tragedy--from childhood deaths to patriarch Edward Walker's (William Hurt) daughter Ivy's blindness. Although Lucias Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) wants to brave the creatures in the woods to reach a nearby town for needed medical supplies, it's Ivy Walker (played brilliantly by Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard) who becomes the true heroine. It's not only about what someone will do to save a loved one, but the true nature of a monster.

But looking back now, already knowing the ending didn't take away from my overall impression of the film. I liked this one, even if IMO it isn't M. Night Shyamalan's best work.

As with his other movies, Shyamalan sets the tone for ""The Village"" using subtle techniques, keeping the audience unsure as to what exactly is happening behind the scenes of the story. ""The Village"" has some great cinematography that focuses a lot on the woods and the village itself that adds to the overall confining feel of the atmosphere. Shyamalan is great at creating suspense and using his tools to his advantage to do so.

As a great number of other reviewers have already stated, Bryce Dallas Howard completely steals the show with her performance as Ivy. A prime example of someone starring in a movie based on talent rather than because she happens to be the daughter of a big-name Hollywood director.

One strong point of ""The Village"" is the superb cast. There really isn't one bad performance. Everyone was a pleasure to watch, even the ones who didn't get much screen time. The romance sub-plot between Phoenix and Howard was definitely one of the ""glues"" that hold this movie together. They had great chemistry and worked well off each other. Shyamalan's injection of humour (ie: the young boys seeing who can play Chicken the longest while provoking the creatures) was done nicely and didn't take anything away from the movie's tone.

This isn't to say that ""The Village"" doesn't have its flaws. It could have used a better script. I found some of the dialog to be just ""filler"" and not contributing to the story or flow. This made me want the characters to stop talking and get on to the next scene. A great script will make the audience want to get engrossed in the dialog. Unfortunately, I only felt this at a handful of occasions. And of course, the surprise twist ending. I can't put my finger on it but it just didn't seem to pack the punch that Shyamalan intended it to. And again, I'm not just saying this because I already knew it beforehand. Many others have said the same thing too. It's as if the twist ending tries to make the movie slightly more important than it is. I just feel like Shyamalan could have presented it better.

""The Village"" is an entertaining and enjoyable fourth film from M. Night Shyamalan even if it may not be his best. Despite some flaws, it showcases what he is most good at: telling a story. And the plot twists, while not perfect, are compelling (there are actually 3 plot twists if you think about it, since the movie being different from what the trailer suggested can be seen as a plot twist too). Overall, a worthwhile viewing and DVD purchase.",1093564800,2,2902,4.616279069767442
2167800,3,B00064LJVO,"I usually am a big fan of M. Night Shyamalan, his movies have a way of scaring me to my very core and that is hard to do.  I anticipated The Village from the moment I saw the trailer.  The plot was good and the actors were well picked, although I must say Adrian Brody surprised me. I enjoyed The Village until the ""shocking moment"" arrived, then I was just pissed off.  I like horror movies to stay within their genre throughout the entire movie. I was still able to enjoy the love story subplot in the movie, but I was nonetheless dissapointed that ""Those we do not speak of,"" were not what they appeared to be.  I still like Shyamalan and I do think that, despite of the criticisms, he is a great director.  This film may have just needed a little more fine tuning.",1093478400,,768,4.232876712328767
2167801,4,B00064LJVO,"If you're expecting a gory, bone-chilling movie about monsters terrorizing a town, you'll be very disappointed with Shyamalan's latest. The Village is actually a very well- put together love story with a few creepy events thrown in to keep you on the edge of your seats. And while the ending, doesn't  have a twist near as good as the Sixth Sense, it wraps up agreat movie nonetheless. Also, the score for this film (by James Newton Howard) is amazing. Bryce Howard gives an Oscar worthy performance.

2167802,5,B00064LJVO,"I think most people's problem with this movie was that all the hype portrayed it as a thrilling horror film, which it definitely wasn't. Sure, there were suspenseful moments, but it wasn't a bone chilling horror or anything.

Ignoring this, The Village was a beautifully done film that concentrated more on the bizarre twists of human nature, rather than a gore/spook fest. The two major twists left you gasping, and the end of the movie is left open-ended, a fitting conclusion that leaves you wanting more.

The Village is mainly about a small village in colonial times that has an unspoken pact with the monsters in the woods surrounding them, that they won't enter the woods and in return the monsters (""those we do not speak of"") won't bother them. Granted, the plot is rather shallow and one sided, but this doesn't mean it's a bad movie. No, it stuck in my mind as one of the best movies I'd seen this summer. Also, the plot has two major twists that make it much more interesting. Joacquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody and Bryce Howard's performances are beautiful and completely convincing. The beginning has most of the suspense, whereas the end of the movie concentrates on resolving the major conflict.

So don't go into the Village expecting a movie that will scare the crap out of you; instead expect a somewhat suspenseful movie that's very well made and enticing throughout. If you're looking for this kind of a movie, I'd highly recommend seeing it. I loved it, and I hope you do too.",1093478400,5,1494,4.716475095785441
2167803,1,B00064LJVO,"A film by M Night Shyamalan

The villagers were warned to stay out of the forest.  So long as the villagers stayed out of the forest, ""Those We Must Not Speak Of"" will leave the village alone.  It is an uneasy truce within the village.  Anything colored red is immediately destroyed or buried because it might attract ""them"".  The villagers live with a kind of Puritan morality, strict, but heartfelt.  A date on a tombstone sets the year as 1897.  They seem to be completely isolated from the rest of the world hint at how bad life was in ""the towns"".  The elders have taught their children that the rest of the world is a nasty place, and that they are striving to live a moral life.  And stay out of the woods.

A young man, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) seeks the permission of the elders to pass through the woods to ""the towns"" so he can get medicines for the townspeople, but the elders say that the danger of ""Those We Must Not Speak Of"" is too great, and it should not be risked.  Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a blind woman, but is very bold and speaks her mind, and appears to be interested in Lucius.

There would not be much of a movie if nothing actually happened (though there is a feeling of stasis through much of the movie), so in some way the ""truce"" will break.  It has to.  The question has been raised as to who or what these creatures are in the woods, and what danger they may pose to the village.  Shyamalan is a master at raising the level of tension through what we don't see.  The boogie man is only truly scary when we don't see him but can ""feel"" him coming.  So it is with ""The Village"".

This being a Shyamalan movie, we know that there is going to be a twist.  From the first frame of the movie, most viewers are going to analyze everything on screen to figure out what is going on and what is wrong with what we are seeing.  After ""The Sixth Sense"" we are conditioned to know that color is very important and with this movie stressing color (the ""safe"" and ""bad"" colors"", we are looking for any sort of clue.  This is initially the strength of the picture, but is also its greatest failing.  If Shyamalan is going to give such a promising setup, and builds the tension so that expectations are raised, he ought to deliver with the reveal.  The reveal does not even need to be perfect or amazingly shocking, but it does have to be good.  It's not.

Throughout the movie the characters are all speaking in a very stilted, formal tone and style and it grates.  Worse, it is boring.  Shyamalan is able to build tension about the woods and ""Those We Must Not Speak Of"", but by the ending the film is nothing but a disappointment.  ""The Village"" does not Deliver.  Certainly not on the first viewing, and there is nothing to warrant a second or third viewing.  Watching ""The Village"" and piecing it together, i was left with the thought: ""That's it?  That's what the movie is about?""

There is a bright spot.  Bryce Dallas Howard in her first starring role.  She was fantastic and i would love to see her in something else, anything else.  Everything else was drab and dreary: the acting, the dialogue, the ending, Oscar winning actor Adrien Brody in an inexplicable role.  Still, Bryce Dallas Howard was a shining star in a movie best left unseen.

M. Night's trademark, of course, is the twist ending, but the delivery of it here is not as shocking as in The Sixth Sense or even Unbreakable. Shyamalan is a master at telling a simple story, however, and there are moments when he breathes an amazing amount of new life into scenes we have seen a thousand times before.

Picture and colors are exceptionnal, cast is just great, no time wasted in the story telling.

My personal congratulations to  the director for the taking the creative risk of producing a mainstream film that doesn't conform to the formulaic user's manual of Hollywood slasher flicks but insteads utilizes an almost anachronistic, 19th century novelistic approach to film-making to communicate a potent warning with much more staying power than may be readily apparent at first glance.",1093392000,8,827,5.203007518796992

In the VILLAGE we have idealic setting deviod of all the things that we can relate too like a place on earth completely deviod of minority groups of anykind with the exception of very odd cauasians. The color red is bad, and we have a person suffering from mental retardation as a form of comic relief, and better not leave the confines of the Village or else these monsters will get you but wait a minute they're not really monsters...I don't want to give away much like the GOTCHA ending. But I have to give it to Shyamalan, he can create some creepy atmosphere but you have to do some of your own digging for substance. This films wasn't as bad as some reviewers have panned it. But I'll be honest, I would rather watch THE PRINCE OF SPACE than this film twice. But I invite you to see it for yourself.",1093305600,,965,4.278688524590164
2167808,4,B00064LJVO,"Like many child stars, Mr. Shyamalan has fallen into a niche which, it seems, he cannot climb out of. Most child actors have some kind of catchphrase, as Shyamalan's trademark is the ""Gotcha!"" genre. People who see these child actors attempt to break their image usually disapprove and only want to see what they were originally given. People keep expecting to see another ""Sixth Sense,"" but it probably will not come. Get over it. Each movie he has produced thus far has been a world apart and altogether unique from any other he has made. The Village has been criticised for not being what its predecessors were, but this is an unfair juxtaposition.

First and foremost, The Village is not intended to be anything like The Sixth Sense OR Signs. Its theme is all its own, and while it does have one or two instances which the audience will jump (much less than in The Sixth Sense) its purpose is the message, not the fright factor. It is easily the least scary of the three major Shyamalan movies.

Second, the dialogue. If one were to be in any time period where one would speak in a different dialect and a movie were made about it, shouldn't that movie have the dialect as well? People scrutinize the way in which the people of the movie speak, but if you stop and think, it makes sense. Why would they talk like we do? They are supposed to have lived a couple hundred years ago, right? They should talk that way.

Thirdly, the ending, which hold similar style to Hitchcock's ""The Birds."" William Golding's classic, Lord of the Flies, was criticised for not tieing up those loose ends. Now, we look back and see that we were wrong; it is a great book. LOTF, like The Village, is about the metaphorical value in comparison to the real world. It does not need to tie up the loose ends. It's not about the ending, it's about what happens in the movie and how it is like our frame of reality.

Admittedly, it has its flaws. The camerawork is shoddy at times, the plot not top-heavy with plot twists or overbourne with dramatic realizations, but its about the message, not the moment. But it is worth a see and not worth many of the harsh review it has been given. It is NOT what its predecessors were, but it is good nonetheless.

2167810,4,B00064LJVO,"I just finished seeing M.Night Shyamalan's `the Village' and I was pleased with the movie! True, it is nothing like his previous works such as ""Signs"" and the ""Sixth Sense"", but nevertheless it is very entertaining.

The story revolves around the citizens living in a tranquil village, surrounded by woods. They lead a calm and peaceful life, not bothered with the outside world and content with what they have. However, dark and mysterious creatures live in the surrounding woods that the villages are terrified of. The villagers and the creatures of the woods have made a truce as to never set foot on each other's settings. However, things change when Ivy Walker, a blind woman, has to cross the woods to get medicine, in order to save the man that she loves. What follows is a series of happenings that makes `The Village' so entertaining to watch.

Many critics have slaughtered the reviews for this movie because they keep fixating on the level of intensity and spooks that this movie gives. True, this is a mysterious, eerie movie, but just because it is, doesn't mean we have to expect ghosts and goblins to pop out of no reason. It is more of an intellectual movie and talks a lot about human nature, about how safe we really are, even if we try our best to prevent all dangers from taking place. In a way, this movie makes a lot of sense, especially in the end, when you think about it and say `Ok, that's why the color red was not allowed in the village' and things like that.

Bryce Dallas Howard, who played the role of Ivy, did a tremendous job for her role and should definitely be nominated for an award. She conveys her feeling beautifully in each scene and shines throughout the movie. The rest of the actors, Adrien Brody, Joaquin Phoenix, Judy Greer all played their parts well, even though there wasn't too much of it.

This movie is not that scary, but it does have a lot of twists to it, which you don't expect coming. The soundtrack is also great which keeps the tempo of the movie well placed. On the whole, it is a movie worth watching!",1093219200,6,2062,4.520107238605898

Perhaps the thing that most people react to is that it isn't what they expect.  It is being marketed as a horror film.  This is a suspense film.

Shyamalan is working against his past films and reputation.  I fear that audiences are going in with too many expectations.  We all know that there will be a surprise ending.  Due to the press, I all ready had a good idea of what the surprise was, but the pleasure comes from the way in which the secret is revealed.  Shyamalan comes from the old short story/Twilight Zone school of storytelling, wherein the pleasure comes not from cheap thrills, but the gradual buildup of tension to be released with an ironic ending.

All in all, if you come to the film with no preconceptions - and you like his other films - I think you will enjoy The Village.",1093219200,2,928,4.374269005847953

Bryce Dallas Howard, debuting as blind girl Ivy Walker, sparkles with courage and grit; Adrien Brody builds up the tension with his schizophrenia, while Joaquin Phoenix moves with his subtle performance of rage. Supporting cast Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt is under-used however. Shyamalan's pace may be slow in the first half of the film, but the atmospheric tingles coupled with James Newton Howard's haunting score will keep you awake. Not his best to date, but the Village shimmers with the allegorical unease and insecurity that hasn't left us since 9-11.",1093132800,,924,5.208053691275167
2167817,5,B00064LJVO,"For all those daunted by the reveiws out there that degrade this movie, please read this.  I am what may be considered a fan of M. Night Shyamalan - I have seen all three of his previous movies and enjoyed them very much.
I found this movie to be thrilling, well paced, and enjoyable.  I have heard some say that it is not thrilling at all because the monsters looked so fake.  All I can say is, even though they looked like ""warthogs, dressed up like bushes in cloaks"", I was still jumping out of my skin.
Another point brought up is that the movie is too slow.  If the ""slow"" parts did not equal the thrilling parts, it would become either A) a half-hour Japanamation flick, or B) a sci-fi thriller with no plot.  Hence, slower=boring, not interesting, and not exciting; faster=no story, not interesting, and exciting(but why bother?).
I was willing to look beyond all the bad reviews, and have found a very good movie.  As for its being enjoyable, you will have to watch it and determine an opinion for yourself.
P.S. - I began counting at the begining of the movie and (though I lost count some-where) I counted at least 50 prepositions.

REVISION:

I would like to point out that my previous feelings and my current feelings go to show that some movies are just better in the theature...you don't see all the holes there.

I would now like to take this space to contrast this movie with the wonderfully culty (and subtly Catholic) Signs.

In Signs, the main conflict was between Graham and God, as simplified by the relationship between Graham and his son.  This is a very important and moving theme for todays world, and the resolution was very clear and enlightening.

In the Village, the main conflict that I see is between the parents and their fears.  While these fears are obviously well grounded, they are unfortunatly delt with in the wrong way.  I mean, running away and cloistering themselves in a corner, cowering, and FRIGHTENING their children into staying away from the ""real world"".  That's like saying, ""don't sin - the boggie man will get you.""  The parents take this opportunity to teach their children valuable lessons in TRUE courage, then wimp out.
.As a homeschooler, I find a certain point about this movie very important to make. I've aqctually had people come up to me and ask, ""but if your so shelterd, how are you going to make it in the 'real world'?""  These people, like the Village parents, have forgotten about the REAL real world: Heaven.  If you suddenly force temporal issues on the fragile person a child is, you shatter any hope of teaching them anything life-affirming.  On the other hand, parents shouldn't follow the example set by the Village (this is also what those 'people' who 'came up to me' think homeschoolers do): shelter your children from the world completly, don't let them know about much of the sin out there, and scare them into remaining locked in this glass house for the rest of their lives.

The parents of the Village should have followed the example of homeschoolers.  Yes they should have sheltered them from 'the world', but not in a falsehood: in the time tested world of a whole family.  They should have instilled in their children the strong morals neccessary to survive in the culture of death.  After doing this, the Village parents could put their children's safety completely in God's hands, as they allowed their now fully grown 'babies' to take on 'the world' one fight at a time.

This is the main point that Shymalan skipped in the Village that he wisely included in Signs: Faith in God.  In the Village, he sets up a place where mortal men isolate themselves and expect to battle the sins of the entire world.  There fighting the losing battle because Satan works through man.  Satan uses the fear of the parents to overwhelm them to such a degree, that in the end it is against the sin caused by this ungodly fear that their very children have to fight.

Um...so the moral of the story, kiddies: Shyamalan should get a strong Catholic like Gibson to help him with any and all of his movies.

And a girl who really looks blind.

Night Shyalaman (not counting ""Praying with Anger"" or ""Wide Awake""). The thriller of the year, it woahed critics and movie goers alike.

""Unbreakable"" followed, and cut the Shyalaman fanbase in half, as did ""Signs"" in 2002, but it was this reviewers favourite Night movie.

He's back, with a darkly gothic thriller set in a small Pensylvanian village in the late 1800s. The villagers are cut off from the outside world due to a large wood that surrounds the village. According to the Village elders, a mythtical race of creatures inhabits the woods and they live in peace with a truce: The villlgefolk stay out of the woods, and the creatures stay out of the village.

Under the guidence of Edward Walker (William Hurt), the village childeren are educated and there is no need for intervention from the Outside world. Until Lucious Hunt (Jaquin Pheonix, brilliant as ever) ventures into the wood, and the truce ids broken.

Sounds thrilling doesnt it? Well sadly, ""The Village"" never really gets off the ground. The picturesque surroundings are the most exciting thing in the very slow build up, which is only watchable due to Pheonix and Ron Howards daughter Bryce Dallas, who plays William Hurt's daughter Ivy, who is blind. Their performances are excellent, so natural and truly wasted in a bizarrly poor Shyalaman screenplay (nothing like the excellently black comedy edge to ""Signs"" that just teetered above satire).

The first half is lit up by one set piece, the creatures coming into the village to warn us the truce has ended, and that is very well done, Shyalaman showing shades of genuis behind the flaws.

The second half concerns Pheonix being stabbed and Ivy having to cross the woods to seek medical help for her true love. Sadly, 90% of the second act is dishwasher dull and contains twists that most people will see coming. (No Keyzer Soze, then!).

The performances vary, beyond the excellence of the leads, William Hurt shines, but talent is wasted on the supporting characters. Adrian Brody plays a mentally challanged villager, but there is no depth role for him to delve into.

This also goes for Sigourney Waever and Brenden Gleeson.

The most frustrating thing about ""The Village"" is that its not awful, if you think about it, it's quite good, but when you think of the high standards Shyalman has set himself, it falls very short.

Night Shyamalan, The Village is without a doubt the weakest one he has made, and one of the biggest disappointments of the summer. Maybe my expectations were too high after seeing Shyamalan's last movie Signs. At the time, I thought Signs was his best work to date, and I couldn't wait to see what he came up with next. Or maybe I was expecting something from the movie that it had no intention of delivering. I wanted a movie as creepy as Signs, but instead I got a movie that was, at times, tedious. In the end though, I just can't recommend The Village.

The premise of the movie centres on a close knit community who lives in the daily knowledge of dangerous creatures surrounding their village. Some critics (like Roger Ebert) have labeled the story as `hokey', but I don't think it's any hokier than some of Shyamalan's previous movies which deals with the undead, superheroes, and an alien invasion (which some of these same critics liked). My problem with the movie doesn't have anything to do with the premise itself, but with its execution. Signs was a movie that continuously had a sense of dread; that something simply felt amiss. We get none of that in The Village.

Yes we get a few jolts once in a while, but in between we often get some pointless rambling about how the village should be run, that everyone has to bury anything with the `bad colour', and to not be afraid of `Those We Don't Speak Of', which brings me to my next point. Why do they call it the `bad colour' and not simply red, or `Those We Don't Speak Of' the creatures in the woods (or something like that). Will saying red somehow call the creatures forth from the woods? I'd like to know, but Shyamalan doesn't seem to care enough to explain. Now don't get me wrong, I love movies with a lot of dialogue, just as long as its not worthless talking. Maybe he added those terms (bad colour, etc.) into the movie to make it seem more `intelligent', but in my opinion without explaining the reasoning behind those and other terms it just seems pointless and stupid.

The revelation about what the creatures truly were in the movie was a little disappointing. I won't divulge what the revelation was, but I will say that I couldn't help but feel somewhat cheated, but I was willing to accept it in the hopes that the ending would prove to be interesting. Ah yes...the ending. The signature twist ending that is the hallmark of Shyamalan's movies. I thought the ending was great in The Sixth Sense, okay in Unbreakable, and...not so good in Signs. Don't worry I won't reveal what the ending was, but only say that I had mixed feelings about. It was definitely something I had NO idea was coming, and this was both its strength and weakness. I like unexpected endings such as that in The Sixth Sense, but the ending in The Village was over the top (which is something I know many will disagree with) and, to be honest, unnecessary.

On the other hand the acting in The Village was, on the whole, solid. The most notable standouts were Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard. Phoenix plays the quiet Lucius Hunt. It was hilarious to watch one of the village girls profess her love for him, and watching him stand there with a deadpan expression on his face. Howard plays a blind villager named Ivy Walker. I immediately developed sympathy for her having to live the way she does, but she shows great fortitude throughout the movie, and it shows when should stood terrified outside of her house waiting for Lucius during an attack by the creatures, but never running away.

M. Night Shyamalan is a director who his loaded with talent. But even the greatest directors will once in a rare while make a movie that is not up to the standards of their previous works. For Shyamalan The Village would be this movie. I also think that it's a wake up call for him, that he needs to start changing his twist ending shtick. I know that pretty much every movie watcher will expect some kind of payoff at the end when watching his movies, but it's starting to get really old, really fast. I still want to see what Shyamalan does for his next movie, but my expectations won't be so high the next time around.

I give The Village a 5 out of 10.",1092873600,2,4362,4.465495608531995

Night Shyamalan's best horror movie or thriller because it's more than a drama than anything. It's still not a bad movie however because the direction is really good and as is the performances. Bryce Dallas Howard is excellent in a break-through performance as a blind women. William Hurt is really good as well as her father. Joaquin Phoenix is good too but don't be fooled this isn't his movie it's Howard's. If you don't expect monsters or aliens and if you can accept it as just a drama you'll enjoy the Village.",1092873600,5,656,4.5210084033613445
2167824,4,B00064LJVO,"""The Village"" is about a small community living in Pennsylvania in the 1890's. They are isolated from the outside world, and they don't dare venture into the woods because creatures lie within. A truce is maintained with the creatures, ""We do not stray into their woods, they do not come into our valley.""

This movie is alot better than the reviews it has been getting. It has a terrific message about our government and human behavior. It has some scares, but it mainly isn't what it was marketed to be, a horror movie/thriller. (**SPOILERS**) The message is that the government hides secrets from us and uses the media to control our fears and blind us from the truth. We are ALL living in the village. It also tells us that no matter how hard we try, we cannot run away from pain and suffering, it will eventually find us. It also shows us what kind of a world we live in today, and that love is the main thing that drives us to do the things we do.

The performances are fantastic, especially Bryce Dallas Howard who shines as Ivy (she has major star potential). The score is incredible, probably Night's best score to date (either as good as or better than the ""Signs"" score). The plot twists are not very predictable, but as i said earlier, they are very precise on communicating to us the film's true, fantastic, chilling message. And of course the direction and script are great as always (Night has done it again). The only reason I gave it four stars is because it isn't my favorite M. Night Shyamalan movie, ""Signs"" is my favorite. It still is better than about 90% of the movies that come out in theaters these days.

I recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates fine filmmaking and who goes to watch the film with an open mind, and who is prepared to think, rather than be scared. This movie is not for the average person, but if you're prepared to expect the unexpected, then I highly recommend ""The Village"".",1092873600,6,1928,4.518624641833811

You can also expect a couple of good ""jump"" scenes. The only downfall is a surprise ending that really isn't much of a surprise. But if you're in for a good film, then go and see ""The Village.""

The setting is a 19th century village.  A village protected from the outside world, the world of evil towns, by the woods.  But something in the woods also keeps the people inside the village.  Monsters, Those Who Should Not be Named, whatever you call them, they stay in the woods and the people stay in the village.

But what happens when the Monsters start to enter the village?  Did somebody go into the woods?  Did somebody anger the Monsters?

At first this movie seems like a horror flick.  Then it becomes a thriller, a mystery to be solved.  Then in the clearing with red flowers, as one of the girls in the theater I watched it in screamed, it becomes a horror flick again.  By the end it has totally, completely changed in setting, theme, everything.

""The Village"" continued a downward spiral in his directing ability.  ""The Sixth Sense"" was a superb, suspenseful flick.  ""Signs"" was a good solid film but a step down.  ""The Village"" was a huge disappointment.

The first half of the movie suceeded in building up suspense in depicting the bucolic, Amish-like lifestyle lead by the inhabitants of ""The Village"".  The denizens kept within the boundaries of the town not venturing into the surrounding woods, supposedly home to murderous creatures.  The movie progresses into a preposterous set of circumstances as Joaquim Phoenix gets injured and is need of outside intervention.  The ending proves the movie to be downright stupid.

The acting was non existent with the notable exception of Adrien Brody playing the demented Noah.  William Hurt, a good actor playing the leader of The Vilage was whiny.  Sigourney Weaver could have easily been a statue.

Shyamalan should venture out of his beloved Pennsylvania and avail himself of the talent Hollywood has to offer.  His biggest success was getting me to actually purchase 2 tickets to this forgetable flick.",1092441600,,1277,5.1658536585365855

Well, looks like I was right! The good news is, it was announced that Margaret Peterson Haddix and her publisher are pressing charges against Shymalan and Disney. I don't know how M.

2167834,5,B00064LJVO,"I just got back from seeing The Village and I am utterly amazed by this movie. It was hands down, without question, the best movie I seen this year; maybe in a long time. It was haunting, moving, gave food for thought and yes, did have a few moments that were chilling. This was movies when they are utterly great.

Everybody thinks that this is supposed to be scary but it's not. At the heart of it, it's a love story. And that is what I love about Shyamalan's movies. Is that there is always these little messages entwined in the ""spookiness."" His movies are a rarity in this world, they actually are about something. And here, the theme is love and what love will push us to do.

Another issue in this movie is, at least to me, is that what really is real? We see the world as we we see it but really is it real? The big twist in this movie is that it was modern day, there is no bogeyman in the woods. The villagers were only shown what they were meant to see. So, it gives pause, maybe this is a reflection of our own reality. Ivy said it best when she said, ""I see the world, not as you see it.""

But the scenery, the costuming and violin inspired soundtrack was haunting. The feeling of being in a small Amish styled village was captured very well. This movie was eye-candy in it's own way.

Another thing I liked that this was an ensemble cast, not a star-driven thing. Joaquin Pheonix was great as the stoic Lucius but he did not capture my attention like three other cast members did. Bryce Dallas Howard was amazing as Ivy, the blind girl that Lucius loved. I really hope she goes on to become a big star. She's that good. Adrian Brody as Noah was also well done. At first I felt sorry for Noah, since he was slow but mid-movie, my pity turned to disgust and he was great as well. I also liked Signourney Weaver a lot as well. I just loved how she knew the secrets and how it seemed to get to her at times. She captured that feeling well.

But overall, if you see a movie this week, go see The Village.",1092441600,8,2013,4.151282051282052
2167835,3,B00064LJVO,"What I was expecting from ""The Village"" was a supernatural thriller about some mysterious creatures in the woods. What I got was an allegory on morality, power, and fear. Which begs the question: would I have enjoyed the film more if I had gone in with the right expectations? Honestly, I don't think so.

This is because my expectations were based on something more important, more fundamental than the particular genre of the picture. I was looking for a story to be drawn into and characters to be emotionally invested in. I wanted to be moved and enthralled and entertained. And unfortunately, Shyamalan's latest is a huge disappointment in this respect.

First let me say, I have no problems with the twist at the end. Although I was underwhelmed, the revelation only alters the context (thematic implications), not the text itself (story). The strengths of Shyamalan's previous mainstream movies have always been the characters and the relationships between them. At the very core of ""The Village"" is the budding love between Ivy Walker (Howard) and Lucius Hunt (Phoenix). This relationship is the heart of this film and is crucial to the life of the story. The issue is not that Shyamalan is unable to pull off the romance (their union is a bit heavy-handed and abrupt, but Howard and Phoenix manage to smooth out the kinks with their charm). Rather, the problem is that it is never fully realized. Shyamalan doesn't allow enough screen time for the most important element of the narrative to grow and take hold. This is most evident in the final moments of the film when the last line of dialogue is uttered. The credits roll and there is no catharsis, no exultation, no sense of fulfillment or completion.

I think the source of the problem lies in the conflicting intentions of the filmmaker. What I see in ""The Village"" is two separate films: a love story about sacrifice and courage, and a philosophical meditation on fear and control. Instead of featuring one on the surface and burying the other underneath, Shyamalan attempts a balancing act of narrative and social commentary that, although interesting on their own, fail to mesh together into a cohesive whole. The more I think about it, the more I'm inclined to believe that Shyamalan cared more for his message than his characters. Was the love story simply a tool to hook us in emotionally and to add power to the ideas he's putting forth? Sure seems like it. I suppose, intellectually, it is appropriate for a film about secrets to be presented in a deceptive manner. But emotionally, it makes for a hollow moviegoing experience.

Despite its weaknesses, ""The Village"" is not a complete loss. The love between Ivy and Lucius is deeply moving in its simplicity and purity. And with a crew as skilled as the cast, it is no surprise that the technical aspects of the film are beyond reproach. Although not quite as memorable as some of Shyamalan's other pictures, the presentation of ""The Village"" possesses an alluring beauty in Roger Deakin's cinematography and James Newton Howard's music.

The best example of this is the scene where Ivy stands by an open door and waits for Lucius in the midst of danger. It is a captivating moment, full of power and grace in its lyrical images and engaging violin melody. Like all great cinema, the sequence is noteworthy not only for what you can see on the surface (a story element that vividly crystallizes Ivy's and Lucius' love) but also for what you can sense underneath (a subtle reflection on blindness, fear, love, vulnerability and courage).

Of all of M. Night Shyamalan's mainstream films, ""The Village"" is my least favorite. As a social commentary, it is thought-provoking but clumsy. As a romance, it starts off well but never comes to fruition. And as a suspense thriller, it simply fails to thrill or entertain.",1092441600,3,3835,4.847328244274809

Watch this movie without such a critical eye and with more of an open mind and I promise you'll really enjoy it.  Did I have it figured out before the end?

""The Village"" is more along the lines of a psychological thriller rather than a scary movie. It shows how powerful of a tool fear is. How it can be used and misused to consume and manipulate and entrap.

When I first saw ""The Village,"" I thought it was horrible. But after thinking about it for a little while, I began to understand the underlying message it was trying to get across.

I beg of you to give this movie a chance and to recognize how smart it really is. It is very underrated and superbly done. You never know what you might learn about human behavior or about yourself.",1092268800,7,1161,4.31651376146789
2167845,4,B00064LJVO,"Ah....The Village.

When I saw this film, I had no expectations. I know M. Night Shyamalan's style well enough by now to realize that his films don't live up to any expectations; they go in a different direction entirely. Critics will attempt to define them, but they generally fail to do so properly.

The Village is a movie about fear. It is not, however, a frightening movie. The trailers misrepresented it as such, what with the ominous ""FACE YOUR FEARS"" and such - or maybe they didn't misrepresent it at all - it's still a movie about fear. More specifically, it's about how people use fear, and how it affects them.

The tiny 1870s community of Covington is comfortably surrounded by a thick forest which shields them from the outside world, and that's just how the elders like it. ""The Towns"", as anything beyond the forest is generally referred to, are corrupt and evil and it is best that everyone stays within the borders. Not that they have a choice. Years ago, when the elders founded Covington, they struck a deal with nameless creatures that live in the woods - the creatures would protect their borders but not cross them, and the people would stay out of the forest.

In this village full of superstitions and odd rules, we focus on a few characters in particular. Lucius Hunt is a quiet, fearless young man who nevertheless seems to have a bit of trouble with public speaking. After the tragic death of a nameless young boy, he seeks permission from the elders to venture into ""The Towns"" and fetch some medecines to prevent further tragedy - a request that is summarily and repeatedly denied. Played by Joaquin Phoenix in one of his best performances to date, Lucius is one of the most intruiging and appealing characters I've ever seen on film.

Also in the village is a young woman named Ivy Walker. Though blind, Ivy enjoys life to its fullest potential and seems ever-full of conversation and laughter. Bryce Dallas Howard makes her star debut here, in an Oscar-worthy performance that left me stunned. Ivy is, of course, in love with Lucius - and after some persausion Lucius admits that he feels the same way.

With these two, it seems the film can hardly go wrong. An as long as it focuses on them, it cannot - the scenes with one or both of them are sometimes funny, sometimes sweet, occasionally sad, but always dead-on and so very real.

Another performance worth mentioning is Adrien Brody's portrayal of the mentally unstable, childish Noah. The sibling-like relationship between himself and Ivy is sweet and charming, but - and for fear of ruining the plot I shall say no more - there is much more to Noah than meets the eye.

When tragedy strikes this idyllic village, it strikes far too close to Ivy for her liking, and she is determined to set it right. She seeks her father's permission to venture into ""The Towns"" for medication, knowing he will hardly have the heart to refuse her.

What follows is a slow untangling of the web of deception that held Covington together. Revelation after revelation will spin the heads of anyone fortunate enough to have avoided reading any of the critic's reviews of this film, which generally spoil the plot in some way. Just when you think you have it all figured out...well, you don't.

There is no question about it - this movie is artfully and skillfully done. But the question remains, why do it at all? As its final scene faded out to black, the audience with which I shared the experience nearly broke out into an audible cry of frustration. So many loose ends...just left there....hanging? That wasn't like Shyamalan! What was he trying to do? The climax was so unsatisfying that many people universally panned the entire movie despite its obvious merits.

But what of the journey? Is this a film where the sum of the parts is greater than the whole? I believe so.

Shyamalan's message in this film is clear: you cannot escape evil by shutting it out. Evil is everywhere - even inside the ones you love - even inside you. Only one thing is stronger than evil. Love. And, in the end, nothing else matters.

Maybe there's a method to his madness. By leaving so much of the plot unresolved at the movie's conclusion, he is telling us that, in fact, it doesn't matter - despite what we may think, it really doesn't matter.

People don't like to be told that. They don't like to pay money to be told that it doesn't matter what happens in the end, because love conquers all. They want to see it happen.

Shyamalan, as usual, has given us something Completely Different. I beg you not to be prejudiced in your judgement of this film merely because it is just that - Completely Different. Give it a chance.

And face your fears.",1092268800,13,4702,4.626650660264105
2167846,2,B00064LJVO,"The Village is an overly serious, and, as a result, unintentionally funny suspense/horror tale that is really a fable. It appears that writer/director M. Night Shyamalan believes he is imparting some great wisdom here, but the slow pace, stilted dialogue and ultimately slender payoff don't carry the film very far. The story is set in a village populated by somber, Puritan-like people who live in perpetual fear of monsters who live in the surrounding forest. It is forbidden to venture outside the village and when a tragedy compels someone to travel to the outer world for medicine, the community's supposedly idyllic life is threatened. Everyone in the film speaks in a ridiculously formal pseudo-19th Century style. Not that I recall how people spoke a century ago, but I simply cannot believe anyone ever talked like this. This style might  have been effective for a parody, but here it is mainly a distraction. If this wasn't enough to make it hard to take the film seriously, the villagers also walk around at times in silly yellow, hooded robes which are supposed to repel the monsters.

Aside from the dialogue, the main problem with The Village is that the basic dullness of the place detracts from what is meant to be the film's central conflict. The basic question here seems to be whether the villagers haven't paid too high a price for their secluded existence. Yet, considering how uptight and downbeat everyone is, you end up wondering why anyone would want to live there under any circumstances. The cast does the best it can with the script and implausible plot. William Hurt is one of the village ""elders"" who presides over the frightened citizens. Joaquin Phoenix is Lucius, a brave but even more somber than average young man.  Bryce Dallas Howard, as a blind girl named Ivy who is in love with Lucius, adds a spark of life to the film, though she too is limited by the script. Like Shyamalan's other (and better) films, there is a secret to The Village which is meant to shock, as well as impart an all too obvious lesson. About halfway through, I was hoping the monsters would eat the whole village.",1092268800,6,2124,4.782016348773842

2167850,4,B00064LJVO,"Now that the dust has settled the subtle insights can be seen. The speculation is rife with the theory that Shyamalan in The Village has made the same point Michael Moore made in Fahrenheit 9/11. The point being made is that when people are afraid you can control them easier. The Village says ""Those we don't speak of"" are the ""enemy"" and we must look out for them. We will ""alert"" the rest when they are sighted because that is when ""terror"" is near.

Fear of the other side, fear of the unknown, fear of an enemy, real or imagined are useful to ""those who know"". If you use fear cleverly you can shunt people's independent thought process for either personal gain, or cementing your own insecurities. The Village elders were not bent on power but on protecting their families from experiencing human cruelty. They didn't succeed did they?

There are some subtle messages, which Shyamalan delivers through The Village.

Regardless of all good intentions, when fear is used as a weapon to constantly beat someone into submission you destroy his human spirit.

You cannot escape the inevitability of human suffering no matter how far you run or how deep you bury your head in the sand.",1092009600,7,1185,4.7101449275362315

2167852,5,B00064LJVO,"NOTE: This review contains NO spoilers

Ok, so they hyped it wrongly. From what I have seen of other reviews, many, many people were expecting this to be a horror film, full of thrills and chills and abominable monsters. But I understand that to a degree--the trailers misrepresented the true nature of The Village. What I find amazing is that many turn around and lambast it for a boring, dull, stupid, and in every way inane movie.

Let me tell you...I wasn't expecting a horror film, but I was expecting something different from what I got. What I got, however, turned out to be one of the best movies--if not the best movie--I have ever seen in my life.

First of all, it was directed by M. Night Shyamalan. This of its own accord nearly guarantees that the movie will not be bad. He has an impressive track record--The Sixth Sense was superb, Unbreakable was a bit slow but still not bad, and Signs was both a decent alien movie and an excellent story of a man whose faith stagnates and then is revived. The Village, however, trounced them all. He proves as masterful an artist here--if not more so--as ever. His directing is wondrous--you are fully engrossed in Covington Village and its people, and he makes you care about characters who are 3-dimensional, as opposed to Hollywood's typical fare.

  In one area of this film I think I will have few detractors--the brilliant, moving debut of Bryce Dallas Howard as the blind Ivy Elizabeth Walker, the spunky, pretty leading lady of the film. Watching the film it is amazing to think that Shyamalan introduced himself after seeing her in a stage production of Shakespeare's As You Like It, and landed her in her first major film role. Her performance is stunning, and I will be disappointed if she does not earn an Oscar for it. She deserves every ounce of it.

  Joaquin Phoenix as the lead male role, quiet, short-spoken Lucius Hunt, once again proves that he is a versatile actor. Leaving behind him a record of playing the merciless Roman emperor Commodous in Gladiator and the slightly deadbeat Merill Hess in Signs, he appears in The Village playing a completely different part with excellence. Mr. Phoenix is only 29 years old...he has a career cut out for him.

  All the supporting roles-Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Cherry Jones, and others-are equally good. This was the first film in which I had seen Adrien Brody, and I found his performance as mentally unstable Noah Percy to be quite fine, and without having seen it I can imagine why he got an Oscar for his role in the Pianist.

  One objection I often see in reviews is that this movie was not scary. Well, no, it wasn't, really, in the killer-with-bloody-knife sort of way, nor was it intended to be. But it was suspensful in plenty. It is bad enough when someone is going into danger, but when that person is a blind woman, things start getting more-ok, I take it partly back-scary. So if you are looking for the sort of scariness that will keep you awake night after night, stay away. But if you are looking for some whopping-good suspense, then you just might be interested. You must be prepared, however, to head into a moving, entertaining, stirring-but mercifully clean-love story, filled with good characters, excellent directing, and some good questions to think and talk about.

  Oh, and the soundtrack. Superb. Hilary Hahn, the featured violinist, struts her stuff in some really wonderful violin themes. It is very classically based stuff, and extremely good-and very appropos to what it accompanies in the film...which is always a plus.

  From stem-to-sterm, top-to-bottom, front-to-back, side-to-side, this is an excellent film, and perhaps Shyamalan's best to date. He is going to have difficulty topping this. Instead of blasting him for a boring film maker, please, even if the movie isn't your type, recognize him for the superb director that he is. And for those who haven't seen it yet-my advice to you is see it now. Support this film. I hope that, as friends speak to friends, this film's theatre take will increase. It certainly deserves it.

  Final warning: I beg of you, do not let ANYONE spoil ANYTHING about this film to you. There are secrets which would be much better to find out as you go. If you know them beforehand, it will spoil it.

  And now, though it does not really capture the true feeling of the film-enter the woods...if you dare.",1091923200,6,4417,4.74738219895288
2167853,5,B00064LJVO,"So it's not as exciting as Signs, or as scary as The Sixth Sense. You know why? Because it's a totally different film. I watched this twice in the theaters so far without being the least bit bored. I see some plot holes and such, but it doesn't bother me in the least. This film is beautifully directed and the cinematography and editing and all that jazz are perfect. Night always was good at filming a shot a certain unique way, it's different and I like it. At least this isn't another cheesy cliche film about a blind chick in love with this quiet dude. There's more involved and dang did I mention it's directed quite well? Night also picks out unusual names for his characters, keeps everything interesting. Good film, so it's not the most perfect, but its a darn good view, that's art baby!",1091923200,5,797,4.465753424657534
2167854,5,B00064LJVO,"This movie is definitely worth a watch. Although it starts slow and does not really add anything to the viewer's knowledge till it's half over, it makes up for it all in the end. The twist is not thin by any definition of the word... only the few who do not understand the end are the ones to call it thin. But in that case the million dollar question arises: how could anybody be so dumb? The end is absolutely clear... unless you have an underdeveloped brain.
The latter half of the movie is very gripping and pays off well for the patience which the audience shows in the first half.
The most remarkable feature of Shyamalan's movies is, that unlike other horror movies, they are not stuffed with scary scenes. Instead, he invites the audience to think about the mystery... about what the theme is. Also, the hidden message in the movie makes an extremely strong impact.
So if conventional gimmicks rather than involving intelligent direction attract you to a movie, this one is not for you.",1091923200,6,994,4.589887640449438

2167856,1,B00064LJVO,"I must start off by saying that I am a dark fiction writer, so I am, perhaps, slightly more critical of ""horror"" than others are. That said, I am sorry to admit that my hero, the usually delightful Mr. Shyamalan, has produced a movie that somehow lacks plot elements that were necessary to make this movie a good movie.

For a length of the movie, it had great potential, although it was slow. I decided to give it a bit; that he might have been trying for good ol' gothic ""boo!""s. But the time dragged on, and suddenly, when my moviegoing companion and I were expecting the normal M. Night Shyamalan plot twist that makes everyone go ""what? wow"", there was the plot twist-one of the worst plot deviced I have ever seen! It introduces elements that do not make sense and go unexplained. Viewers are left with more questions than answers and, for the first time, I left one of this man's movies quite unsatisfyied. It is such a shame that acting talent like who was in this movie was wasted. Frankly, I am shocked. I wondered if it would make any more sense if I was able to ask him personally to explain the movie to me before I remembered one of the key indications of a bad plot: if you, as the writer, must explain to each and every one of your fans what your project is about, it is time to go back to the drawing board.",1091923200,4,1324,4.274900398406374
2167857,5,B00064LJVO,I've really enjoyed all of Shyamalan's work and this one does not disappoint. It has a great storyline and the end surprises you.

I'm a fair person, so when the movie started out slow I thought ""well a lot of movies start slow so I'll wait till it picks up"" So I waited, waited, waited and waited...It never got any better. The plot was boring, acting mediocre and did I mention boring? Throughout the whole movie I was waiting for SOMETHING to happen but it never did. I found that looking at the back of someones head more entertaining than the movie. Then I finally did something I should have done sooner: I got up and left!!!",1091923200,4,555,4.245283018867925
2167859,2,B00064LJVO,"I went into this film having known in advance about the ""twist ending"" but really it isn't difficult for the average intelligent person to figure out. It's not like the ""Sixth Sense"", where I was stunned by all of the relevatory clues, but instead, this foreknowledge actually enhanced the meaning of the story. I actually cared about what happened to ""Ivy"" in the woods. Bryce Dallas Howard carried this film the way Goldie Hawn carried ""The Banger Sisters."" I consider both films to be distasters in their own right, but ""The Village"" is not as bad as people are saying it is. The moral is trite and the acting is par, but the last twenty minutes of this film is a compelling homage to all the great love stories. If this film weren't so darn derivative (there is already a novel with similar themes and a poem with a few of the characters' names in it) I would credit M. Night Shyamalan for presenting us a true tale of moral dilemma. This derivation is a slap to M. Night's Shyamalan's credability as an original director, (when Hitchcock directed adaptations he openly admitted they were such). Another reviewer was spot on when he or she described ""The Village"" as a weak, moralistic episode of the ""Twilight Zone."" I missed Rod Serling.",1091923200,3,1243,4.654545454545454

Based on this story I would probably never read or go to another movie by this writer.",1091923200,5,348,3.8450704225352115
2167861,5,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favorite directors, and what happens in this film is another reason why. Night never does what you think he will do, and doesn't cater to the audience in the way most directors do. The Village centers around a group of people who live in a almost amish type setting, away from the rest of the world in what seems to be 1800's. The village members all live together harmoniously, as long as they don't enter the woods, where supposed creatures they can not speak of live, and with whom they have a pact that they must not violate or bloodshed will ensue. They can never have the color red around, as it attracts the monsters. That is the main setup, and the stroy goes from there as Joaquin Phoenix, who gives another great performance in a Shyamalan film, the other being Signs, is a village youth who wants to go to the towns, past the woods, to get medicine, as a child has just died in the town because they could not save him. William Hurt, a great actor in a great role and performance, is the leader of the town and the father of Ivy, played brillinatly in her first role by Bryce Dallas Howard. Ivy is a blind girl who seems to have all the good qualities of the town and everyone loves her, especially Lucius, played by Phoenix and a mentally unstable character played amazing by Adrien Brody. Sigourney Weaver and Brendan Gleeson also put in very good performances in a film that is impossible to talk about unless I give spoilers. The movie is about fear and pain, and what we will do to avoid pain and how we react to fear. It is the most beautifully shot film of the year and is definitely the most engrossing. The score is nothing short of amazing and should be recognized at Oscar time. The film will anger many people who don't like where it goes, but in my opinion, it goes exactly where it should go, and it should mkae us look at our own lives and our feelings on fear and pain. The movie, as thought provoking as it is, is still one of the best films of th year and one of the most entertaining. Ignore what other people might be saying about this film, and see it for yourself. Either way, you will want to have discussions about it.",1091923200,6,2185,4.305825242718447

It wasn't until the ""twist"" when everything went horribly wrong. When it ends it even leaves a big question behind, and not the obvious one the actors point out. I am so tempted to leave spoilers, but others might like it and I woulnd't want to spoil it for them. What I will say is don't spend 8-20 bucks (ticket, popcorn, etc.) to go see it. Just wait until it comes out on video, and not just that, wait until it's at the 1 dollar rental section in Blockbuster or wherever you rent.",1091836800,4,607,4.241379310344827
2167863,3,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" is a big fat miscalculation. Wonderfully directed as it is by the man who has single-handedly revived the horror genre, it is amazingly shallow. It concerns the inhabitants of a 19th century village surrounded by a forbidden forest. The people of the village are good, honest folk who are trying to make better lives for themselves after being touched by violence. But all of the people seem to share a dark secret, and the surrounding woods are inhabited by terrifying creatures that begin to threaten them.

The story, such as it is, centers around a spunky blind girl named Ivy, the daughter of the village's leader (William Hurt). Ivy is played by newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard, and it is her performance that keeps the movie from being a complete train wreck. She has a very strong screen presence, and basically carries the entire movie by herself, since the other actors are barely present. Howard gives a convincing, emotionally affecting turn that is better than the actual movie. Ivy is in love with a brooding, morose man named Lucius, played by Joaquin Phoenix. Phoenix is playing against type here, we don't often see him playing weak, vulnerable characters. Lucius is the only character besides Ivy that you remotely care about, and Phoenix's performance is good, so it's a shame he's only in the first half of the movie.

Shyamalan assembled an impressive cast for his fourth film, and they are all wasted beyond human comprehension. William Hurt stands around spouting pompous dialogue, Sigourney Weaver could have been very interesting but is given absolutely nothing to do, and Adrien Brody stumbles around playing the local idiot, giving a performance worthy of a five year old and making us wonder why he beat Daniel Day-Lewis at last year's Oscars. But this is not really the actors' fault. The blame lies squarely on the fact that Shyamalan's screenplay is muddled and mediocre.

There are several genuinely terrifying moments once Ivy ventures alone into the ominous woods, and some interesting suspense, but it isn't nearly enough. When the big twist finally comes, it doesn't really matter at all, because there is so little substance to what has gone before it. ""The Village"" could have been a great movie had the screenplay gone through another rewrite and the characters become more than background scenary. I still recommend it, despite these reservations. It has a lot of good in it -- chiefly Shyamalan's atmospheric direction and Bryce Dallas Howard's performance. It's no surprise that Howard landed the plum job of replacing Nicole Kidman in Lars von Trier's ""Manderlay."" She deserves it for her effort here.

This movie also had twists to it that  was very much not needed M. night likes twits in his movie but in the village he should of stuck to the horror and suspense script these twists make take the movie from good to bad to awful. To end this i have to say this movie could have been great  but the crazy mind of M.night just doesn't  work  with this film.

 An abortion of a film, ""The Village"" is the ripoff movie of 2004 with ""Van Helsing"" right next to it. These 2 films are playing in every multiplex in hell along with ""Signs"", & ""Hudson Hawk"", with a complimentary helping of ""Howard the Duck"" thrown in for good measure (now THAT'S scary!). ""The Village"" is a scary movie that is made for women (its the type of scary movie that won't induce nightmares. In other words, its NOT scary) & looks like it was filmed on location at the local ""Pottery Barn"".

 ""Covington Woods"" is home to a small village of peaceful people who have a small problem. They can't leave their village due to ""creatures"" living in the woods that surround the boundaries beyond the village. When the villagers first settled down into their new home, they made a pact with the ""creatures"" along the lines of, you leave us alone, we will leave you alone. ""The creatures"" have other ideas sneaking into the village at night leaving behind dead, mangled, & hairless chihuahuas about the grounds & scaring the villagers witless. When a stabbing occurs, that could prove fatal if not without the proper medication, a young blind girl, who isn't afraid of ""the creatures"", is sent to the village across the way to get the proper medication that can heal her future husband.

 As I watched ""The Village"", with roughly 30 other people in the theater, I couldn't believe how bad this film was. The only comedy relief that came throughout the film was when one of my fellow moviegoers promptly stood up during a slow point in the film, declared that this movie, quote - unquote, blows, and then left the theater. What suprised me was that not one of the 29 other people, myself included, didn't disagree with him!

 The movie is a bit of a bore. I do give credit for some great cinematography but thats it. The cast is lame. Everyone walks thru their roles. Sigourney Weaver is wasted in her role (I was waiting for her to cowboy up, slap her idiot son in the back of the head, and go kill ""the creatures"" herself). William Hurt reads his lines as if their on cue cards. Joaquin Phoenix looks like he's on some bad valium trip (his character is reminiscent of the Mel Gibson character from ""Signs"". Phoenix even looks like a bit like Gibson in some shots).

 ""The creature"" is absolutely laughable, being a cross between a pig, & a porcupine with a red riding hood complex (Frank, the bunny from ""Donnie Darko"", is more scarier, for God's Sake!). I would be more scared if a car full of clowns showed up in the middle of the woods, than this ""creature"" chasing me.

 The so called ""gotcha"" surprise that happens in every one of Shyamalan's films usually suck. This one is no surprise (when the surprise is revealed, I couldn't help but think if these people missed watching the Democratic Convention and hugging a tree everyday. Maybe they still hug trees, but their was no hugging of trees on screen).

 Shyamalan's main downfall is that he always has the sense & style to create a suspenseful film but when it comes to the payoff, or the moneyshot he can never deliver (""The Sixth Sense"" is the golden exception). Also, the main problem with Shyamalan's film is, after the release of ""The Sixth Sense"" & with every Shyamalan film there after, audiences know something is going to happen during the final act of the film, so they keep their eyes open for every little detail available thruout the course of the film.

 ""Time"" magazine was once quoted as saying that M. Night Shyamalan is the next Steven Spielberg. No way in Hell, buddy. No way. Not even with a Ford Focus full of clowns.",1091750400,23,3737,4.605421686746988
2167870,5,B00064LJVO,"Due to horrific marketing, the movie has been a hit or miss with the entire nation. Half of the general public loves it, and half hates it.

What makes this movie possibly one of the most misunderstood films of the era? It could be the wildly famous name attached to the writing, directing and producing of the film.

M. Night Shyamalan is forced to break barriers in his movies to entice the public, and yet at the same times becomes trapped by them when, as a mass they are too shallow to see the point of the story.

So it wasn't a thriller or a horror movie. Is that all M. Night is tied to? Is he that underappreciated? The Village holds its own in writing, directing, acting and cinematography. The writing is complex, smart and quietly shocking....if one chooses to bring down all walls and let themselves watch the movie, instead of make it for themselves.

The directing was M. Night's style in every way, with a few mild shakes to it that made the environment seem more original.

Was the acting not noticed? Even if one doesn't appreciate the film as a whole, which is understandable...the acting must not go unnoticed. Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Howard, Adrien Brody, and William Hurt provided breathtaking performances that truly made the film a character based one, rather than predator based. I only hope that the performances given will not be over looked at the beginning of next year, and the Academy will see this movie for itself, and not compare it to the previous three. Does M. Night really have to subject himself to one type of movie? He succeeded in this hit or miss experiment exceptionally well.

All in all, The Village is smart, tragic, subtle, and tremendously moving. That is...if you let yourself free of all expectations.",1091750400,10,1751,4.687296416938111
2167871,3,B00064LJVO,"I liked The Village. It was a huge improvement over Signs, but certainly not in the same class as The Sixth Sense. And, yes, M. Night Shyamalan will forever work in the shadow of his stunningly tight and coherent ""ghost"" story.

 The Sixth Sense wasn't really about ghosts at all, nor is the The Village about carnivorous creatures that lurk in the woods. Sure, there are very real ghosts in The Sixth Sense, as there certainly are scary monsters in Covington Woods. (Of course, I won't spoil it for those who have yet to visit The Village--are the monsters ""real"" or not is a debate that rages on the Web, even after people have seen the film. You need to answer that question for yourself!)

 Don't be misled by reviews that suggest parallels between this movie and President Bush or the war on terror--there really aren't. (The only analogy, I suppose, is that we, like the Villagers are gripped with fear of ""monsters""--in our case, terrorists. But, watch the movie and you'll see any further similarities dissolve as the story unfolds.)

 So, then, what is The Village about? It's a look into the heart of darkness, so to speak. The Village is about idealism, about taking life into your own hands and trying to crush grief, tragedy, and evil. And while there may be all manner of dangerous creatures in Covington Woods, there are also creatures in ourselves--Monsters of the Id. Exactly how far do you need to run, how isolated do you have to be, to avoid those kinds of monsters? In the end, The Village does a nice job giving us an answer.

 Why just three stars? In part, because Shyamalan's storytelling approach--telling the story from the view of average villagers and not the Elders--keeps us from probing deeply and fully its core theme. It's storytelling at the expense of drama and deep, passionate inquiry. If the movie had told us more about why the Village was formed at the outset--it really is, after all, no surprise--I think it would have been a bigger, more satisfying film.

 And when you're done, ask, ""Would I live in The Village? Does the bargain with the creatures do more harm than good?""",1091750400,11,2118,4.684636118598383
2167872,4,B00064LJVO,"I grew up in a very conservative Christian home.  I remember hearing about how the world is slipping down a moral slope.  With prayer in school gone and the lie of ""separation of church and state"" permeating our society.  We as American's have lost those Judeo-Christian ideals that the founding fathers put in place.  Hence we were a fallen nation, and that's why there are so many problems in this Country.

While I'm not asking anyone whose reading this to embrace these ideas, they permeate M. Knight Shyamalan's new film ""The Village.""  An intriguing motion picture that asks and yet never quite answers the questions many American's are asking in this post 9/11, postmodern, and enlightened period.

THE VILLAGE is a quaint little place far from the bustling ""towns"" of evil and greed.  It's a 19-century prairie town, and a utopia where decent people live out their lives in peace and modest prosperity.  Money is not and issue, for the people of THE VILLAGE have no need of it.  They all speak and act like Quakers, and hold close to traditional family values.

Of course THE VILLAGE has its own local government.  It is ruled by board of elders, who are strict but fair.  There seems to be only one rule, ""Stay Out of Covington Forrest.""

You see the forest is the only problem with the Village. It's full of monsters.  As long as the people stay out of the wood The Monsters leave them alone. The other problem is that The Village needs some basic drugs to save its people.  As the film opens we see the casket of a young boy who died because he did not have simple medicine's to keep him alive.  It's a scary existence but there is peace, so it might just be a trade off? Or is it?

THE VILLAGE is the type of movie I personally love.  It is a film about subtext.  But what gives the film its spark is the fact that it doesn't play its message at you. But you only realize this if you give it some time and patience.  If you overlook its flaws, what you'll find is a movie that speaks to any audience.  Without being preachy and overwrought.

It plays with some of the things we as American's have gotten used to in these dark times.  The color terror alert systems, false terror alarms, and presents people like you and me, people who want to go about their days without having to worry about the darkness hiding in the woods.  THE VILLAGE is a typical suburban town, if it was transplanted onto the prairie.

I loved the scene with Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix, GLADIATOR) and Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard, The Grinch) as they sit on the porch in the middle of the night and preach their love to each other.  The scene is alive with energy and light.  Shyamalan frames the shot so close up, you feel like your part of the action, and the actors turn the stilted Quaker like dialogue on its head.

Howard is just phenomenal.  She fills her character with color.  The other actors around her seem weighed down by the stilted dialogue, which I'll admit takes some getting used to.  Howard enchants from the very first frame and commands the audience's eyes.  Like a young Holly Hunter mixed with Julia Roberts, Bryce Howard has the potential to be the next big thing. Watch out pop a couple years from now we could have another Oscar winner in the family.

The other bright spot in the film is Adrien Brody (The Pianist) he portrays Noah the town retard.  Man did he have a good time.  There is energy in his portrayal that just gushes with enthusiasm.  It looks like he's having a ball.  I'll admit there was one moment I thought he was laying it on a little too much.  But I'll forgive him that small moment cause he's just dead on the rest of the time.

At its heart THE VILLAGE is social commentary for both sides of an argument.  For some they will look at these characters and think them pathetic.  Why give up your freedom for safety?  Why allow the government to fuel your fears?  But other will look at these characters and say ""isn't it great that these people got away from the horror of this world? Isn't it wonderful that they created a utopia?  I wish I lived in The Village, free from all the evil influences of the world at large.""

As for the patented surprise ending, it works... sort of.  If you give the movie its due you'll be satisfied.  I smelled it from a mile away and still took a lot away from the movie.  If you don't buy the premise you'll be let down and hate the movie.  But that's okay.  Great movies don't have to be universally loved, as long as you don't leave the theater indifferent the movie will have an effect on you.  It will keep you talking and that's a good thing.

**** Out of 5",1091750400,9,4624,4.397874852420307
2167873,4,B00064LJVO,"....Just because I thought the music in this movie was phenomenal, and there was a pretty good concept to the film overall.

This movie is being marketed as a summer scary/thriller film and I felt it couldn't have been farther from that idea. There were a few moments where M. Night's signature directing style came into effect and mere sounds played a factor into the ""scary"" parts of the movie...but what there weren't an overwhelming number of scary scenes at all. This movie should be taken for what it is...an interesting concept that makes you think quite a bit at the end.

Having enjoyed both the ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"" I felt a bit disappointed after this film, however if you try not to compare them with the others, then it's not all that bad. I was expecting a bit more, mostly from the previews as well as recognizing M. Night's ability to put a significance into EVERYTHING that goes on the film. I felt that was missing a bit from this movie. In the Sixth sense, you get this overall feeling that everything you are seeing has a specific meaning, and at the end, you realize that it does...whereas in this movie, it isn't the same really. Don't get me wrong, the clues are all there, it's just not that much of a suspense, in my opinion.

The movie's good points: Great choice of filming location...the sets and costuming are all realistic and well designed. The essence of the time depicted in the film is there, as are the characters/actors. I particularly enjoyed Bryce Dallas Howard's debut (daughter of Ron Howard). Her performance in this film is both profound and moving...I have no doubt it will catapult her into a broader spectrum of acting. Joaquin Phoenix (who is a large part of the reason I also went to see this film) had another major role, but I felt as though M. Night could have let him shine a bit more....nonetheless a very good performance by him. Adrien Brody's roll is also meaningful and well acted, though not a large roll. Be sure to watch for a cameo by M. Night himself...he's hard to notice because it goes by quite fast if you don't catch on right away, but he's there. Other good points: the music and the overall concept.

Bad points:  The monsters...when you see this film you will know what I mean. With all the talent and creativity, could they not have come up with more realistic/scary looking monsters? Aside from that, there are a few parts of the movie that once you see them, after the film is over, you will begin to think ""well, now how was that possible?"" or ""well, that isn't very realistic"" but overall, these aren't thoughts that dominate over the movie. Once again, this depends on how critical of a moviegoer you are, however. lol

Many reviewers have noted the disappointment in it not being scary...and well, now you have been warned. Also, people have complained that there are infinite plot-holes in this movie. I disagree with this thought...I thought the movie fell into sequence quite well and played through the 120 minutes just fine. I did not see any MAJOR problems with the storyline.

Overall, 4 stars because I think the movie was good. Not GREAT, but good. Not scary, that's for sure, unless you're the extremely skittish type. Interesting idea, great music, good actors, and somewhat of a message at the end that makes you think. My advice is to go to this movie with no expectations whatsoever, just take it for what it is.

 The idea for this movie was an interesting, unique one and pulled off well, however, there was a surprise twist (like all Shyamalan movies have) that took the movie in the wrong direction. If Shyamalan had left the twist out of the loop the movie would have been much better.

 Not as edge of your seat as his other movies, it wasn't as special as I had hoped it would be. My advice, wait for the DVD version...",1091664000,4,662,4.272
2167875,3,B00064LJVO,"I kinda feel bad for M. Night Shyamalan. He has the biggest shoes to fill that any director has had to fill this early in their career. Not only does he have to out-do ""The Sixth Sense"" with every film he makes, he's in the horror genre, which recieves the most criticism out of any movie genre. The huge successes of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"" have set the bar so high for himself that it is almost impossible for him to reach it. He may be a director whose first film is the end of his career, if his future projects follow the footsteps of ""The Village.""

 ""The Village"" is about a group of people in 1897, that live in a village that are surrounded by woods that isolate them from the rest of society. Not only are they isolated from society, creatures live in the woods and as long as the villagers stay within their limits, the creatures won't harm them. One of the village's elder's son get hurt and he needs medication which can only be recieved by going into one of the other towns, which means GOING INTO THE WOODS! The blind girl that is in love with the man that got hurt volunteers to go get the medicine. The story starts to turn when... I'm sorry, I don't want to get sued.

 The characters in this movie do not really get a chance to ""shine."" Bryce Dallas Howard is the only character that really delievers a good performance. I think its kinda ironic, though, that the creatures are attracted to the color red and she was casted to play the blind girl, due to the fact that she has red hair. William Hurt does a good job as well, but none of the other characters get a chance to develop much. M. Night Shyamalan does a great job of telling the story and the setup of the village is amazing. Shyamalan knows how to make a suspenseful scene and he knows how to write a good movie. And yes, there were some twists and I liked the last one, but not the first one.

 My BIGGEST problem with this movie is that it is advertised as a horror movie. ""The Village"" is anything but a horror movie. There were two times in the movie that I jumped, but I didn't have that gut feeling like I had in ""The Sixth Sense"" that something scary was going to happen. The movie just moved too slow. I believe this was why I was so disappointed with this movie. I have no problem if the movie is not advertised as a horror movie and it is not, cause then I am not expecting to be scared. It was like advertising Casablanca (not to compare to two movies) as a comedy movie. M. Night's trend has been to do one good movie, then one average, then one good, then one average, so hopefully the next one will be really good. Overall, if you like romance mysteries or if you're a big Twilight Zone fan, then see this movie. If you want a horror movie, don't bother seeing this.",1091664000,6,2766,4.219281663516068

2167877,2,B00064LJVO,"Clearly Shyamalan was going for a movie more ""Signs"" than Signs itself was: upping the rural factor, putting the adept Joaquin Phoenix in a bigger role, and changing the aliens (I'm not making this up) to hooded porcupine walruses.

 Missing, however, is the originality, humor, and suspense of ""Signs,"" or ""The Sixth Sense"" (I haven't seen ""Unbreakable""). Instead we've got an overbearingly preachy preacher/teacher (William Hurt) and just a generally goofy story. Even Shyamalan's trademark cameo is annoying; we see the back of his head and a faint reflection on a refrigerator (ooh, who is it?)

 I saw this one pretty late at night; I was falling asleep in the first half hour, but did my best to stay up, thinking it would pick up. Nope.

2167879,4,B00064LJVO,"Herein lie spoilers! While I do agree with the fact that I felt the previews mislead, I think I liked the movie better knowing that there really weren't any creatures if you will.

 The movie is set in the 1890's in a small Pennsylvania town where a group of people have lived peacefully away from civilization. The viewer is constantly reminded by many of the elders (the village's government system if you will)of the violence and greed of the city outside of their little establishment.

 The movie was touted with Joaquin Phoenix as the star, but the real gem of the movie was Bryce Dallas Howard who I felt gave the best performance of the movie. Some may say that Adrien Brody's talents were a waste in this movie, but his mentally challenged character was the one that broke my heart in the end.

 I also loved the bond between Phoenix and Howard's characters. I think a lot of movies build up this great big tension when it comes to love between two characters, but Shyamalan's is a gentle one that is just as, if not more powerful.

 Upon realizing that the creatures didn't really exist, I'll admit, ticked me off a bit. But still, the real twist to me was at the end. I think the movies symbolism of trying to leave a world of violence behind in place of a simple, but peaceful existence was excellent, but as the plot proved, violence still found its way into the community.

 This movie also had excellent political hints in it too as to where the elders used the woods and the ""creatures"" as a way to have the people submit to obedience out of fear. I couldn't help but bring the analysis in with the current politics of the world.

 One of the things that I love about Shyamalan's work is the fact that he can take a subject that can so easily become complicated, add a human element to it, and make it seem so simple. I may have gotten a lot more out of this than some 15 year old who was/is expecting a hideous creature, but I think it is one of his best works.",1091664000,3,1978,4.345108695652174

I went to the movie with an open mind and waqs glad that I did. I will have to say that the director was very true to his style. I belive that a lot of people who gave the movie poor ratings came to see it with many preconceived notions of what it would be. I must admit when I first saw the trailers I classified it as a scary movie that would take place in the late 18th century. The beauty of the story is that it is much more than what it appears and the director is very successful in tying together many intricate details into a seemless plot that takes a person's perception of reality on a roller coaster ride. I feel that if the same people who gave this movie a bad review were to have simply sat back and let the story unfold before them rather than coaxing into a direction they thought it should go then they would have enjoyed all that it had to offer.

2167883,3,B00064LJVO,"""The Village"", the new feature from M. Night Shyamalan, concerns a mysterious community living on the edge of a forest, which may or may not harbor ravenous monsters. The beginning of the film has a creepy, Shirley Jackson quality that fascinates the viewer; but this mood eventually fades out in a series of not-too-surprising surprises which are difficult to accept and leave a lot of questions unanswered. It has been suggested that Shyamalan sees himself as a combination of Hitchcock and O. Henry, but he displays neither the directorial mastery of the former nor the literary cleverness of the latter. The veterans in the cast give sturdy performances, bearing in mind they are fully aware of the village's secret while they project their characters. They include William Hurt, handsome in a full beard, and Sigourney Weaver, whose raw-boned beauty is beginning to resemble an Andrew Wyeth model. The younger actors are not as successful. Joaquin Phoenix as a stolid young man is ... well, stolid. Bryce Dallas Howard is not at all convincing as a blind woman, but then the script is awfully vague regarding the nature and extent of her blindness. Adrien Brody's village idiot turns out to be the movie's scariest element. To be fair, Shyamalan can be effective and some of his scenes are striking, such as the pivotal encounter between Phoenix and Brody. Other scenes, like the final one, are hopelessly stilted; and, unfortunately, it's the latter impression that dominates ""The Village"".",1091664000,,1496,5.085365853658536
2167884,1,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan hasn't made a good film since THE SIXTH SENSE. Heck, he hasn't even made a decent one. UNBREAKABLE and SIGNS were overhyped garbage, and THE VILLAGE just might be the worst of the lot. Yup folks, THE VILLAGE is another in a string of disappointing Shyamalan flops. ""What was he thinking?"" you ask. We may never know, but perhaps the color green has alot to do with it, as his Sci-Fi special proved. You know the one--the special Shymalan was supposedly trying to keep off the air because they had lots of dirt on him and his past life, when in fact, he was in on the scam the whole time. Perhaps even Shymalan had no faith in THE VILLAGE and needed the publicity for a strong opening weekend. He got it, but I have a feeling next weekend won't fare so well.

With UNBREAKABLE and SIGNS, Shymalan created a good story and interesting characters before ruining the films with absurd endings. (In SIGNS, I think the cheesy alien costumes ruined it for me.) Unlike UNBREAKABLE and SIGNS however, THE VILLAGE didn't even start off well, as promising as the story seemed. I rolled my eyes at the dialogue and mediocre acting from the very first frame. I thought, and hoped, the film might get better as it progressed, but it got worse. MUCH MUCH worse. When the monster made its first appearance, I began to lose hope. I don't think I've sighed so loudly or checked my watch so often during a movie. THE VILLAGE was slow moving, boring, cheesy, and ultimately pointless.

Most of all though, THE VILLAGE fails because the story fails to connect with it's characters and subsequently it's audience. The film seems to be floating around in some weird fantasy world where it's a good idea to send blind people stumbling around helplessly in the forest. Nothing about the story made sense to me, not the characters, not the situations they are presented in, nor the idiotic, nonsensical, and utterly predictable twists. I was most dissapointed because I couldn't believe Shymalan could have assembled such a great cast for what is undoubtedly a terrible script. The fact that he went so far as to put them all through boot camp to learn and live like they are in the 1800's (the extensive prep was why Kirsten Dunst had to drop out) was very pointless considering where the film eventually led.

I'm not going to lambaste THE VILLAGE for being predictable though. That's too easy and often Shyamalan haters get so caught up in his movie's twists that they miss the bigger picture. The twist doesn't matter if the journey is compelling. In THE VILLAGE, it just isn't Nothing about it is. Night presents generally static characters who end the film much as they began. He just doesn't have anywhere to take us, and it unfortunately takes forever to get there.

Newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's daughter) proves surprisingly charming even though the somewhat stunted dialogue she's given doesn't leave a lot to work with. She, along with the rest of the cast, who, except for Adrien Brody, aren't very good, is one of the few only redeeming quality in this ludicrous film. For a movie being touted as suspense, THE VILLAGE isn't very suspenseful and for a movie with such big anticipation THE VILLAGE doesn't seem to have much to deliver. There are some effective moments, but they are FEW and far between. There are some good things about this film, but on a whole, it's just lame. For one, the cinematography, is creepy. But unfortunately, that doesn't save the film. I was expecing it to be bad, but in no way did I think it would be THIS bad. I'm dumbfounded that anyone actually liked this!

As an added note, I would like to say that the story and ""twist"" for this film are VERY similar to that in the young adult novel, Running Out of Time, by Margaret Peterson Haddix. Don't believe me? For those who've seen the film, PLEASE check the summary of the book on Amazon. Did Shymalan plagiarize? Who knows, but I wouldn't doubt it.",1091577600,4,3951,4.646638054363376
2167885,4,B00064LJVO,"Before seeing this movie, I read reviews that praised it and reviews that slammed it. My friend and I decided that we wanted to judge for ourselves. Having seen it now, I'd say whether or not you like this movie is going to depend on what you're looking for.

 If you're looking for lots of action ... if you're looking for horror (bloody or otherwise) ... if you're looking to be scared out of your wits ... if you're looking for nearly unbearable suspense ... if you're looking for lots of mind bending twists and turns ... or a repeat of ""Unbreakable"" or ""The Sixth Sense"" ... then you probably won't enjoy this movie ... because this movie is none of those. BUT ...

 If you're looking for a very well crafted movie that takes you on a thought provoking journey that looks into both the personal and social needs to face our fears and make choices in the face of those fears in order to create a better life for ourselves ... then you might just find this movie as enjoyable as I did.

 ""The Village"" has it's twists and thrills, but it's not ABOUT twists and thrills. To my mind, this movie was about people facing their personal fears and the fears they hold as a group. It's about deciding whether or not to confront those fears and thereby craft a better life ... better than the lives they know and have chosen to leave behind them ... and better than the worst of what they fear may lie in the unknown that waits ahead.",1091577600,13,1429,4.333333333333333

 The more I thought about the film & discussed it @ 2am afterwards, and the days that followed (actors, scenes & story) the more I liked it. Initially, I wanted to be scared more, ...alone in the woods? At night? Breaking twigs? FEAR itself.

 The cool thing about this film is that I remained scared even after a fear-defeating moment. (This is probably the most important aspect of the film and what makes it a winner in my book!)

 The monsters, or bad-guys, are amazing!

 M. Night seems to pick genre's well:

 ""The Sixth Sense"" was about ghosts - if you don't like or believe or are scared of them the movie won't have the same effect (discounting the whole ""trick"" ending that everyone seemed to love). The same goes for ""Unbreakable"" relating to comic books/superheroes. And the aliens in ""Signs"".

 If you aren't frightened by the concept then the movie losses something. If the woods at night doesn't scare you, you won't enjoy the ""punch"".

 The audience had mixed feelings, (with one group of young teenage boys loudly voicing their disdain: ""Boo! That sucked"" etc., but they most likely expected a thriller.), but I will be front line center for M. Night's next film.",1091577600,35,1193,4.673076923076923
2167887,2,B00064LJVO,"Despite promising trailers, this movie fails to deliver the fear factor. I would not classify this movie as horror. Rather, as a mixture across genres. It is a drama, not horror as the trailers might mislead you to think -a thriller at most. If you are looking for a scary horror flick, look elsewhere.

The movie is not as visually disturbing as you might expect. In fact, save for one or two shots, the semi-eerie music in the background is the best attempt by the movie to leave the audience with any after effects.

I was hoping to see a M. Night Shyamalan movie that will impress me as the 6th sense once did. His subsequent films after the 6th sense just didn't seem to leave the same aftertaste. I faced disappointment after disappointment (Unbreakable, Signs,...) and now I barely taste anything at all after seeing the Village. It was as if Shyamalan has lost his flavor.

I recall I was not impressed when I saw those aliens in the conclusion of Signs, but now these red cloaked 'creatures' with claws in The Village look waaaaaay too artificial -rather than superficial, as they were portrayed to be in the movie.

I did not feel any chemistry build up, as I had intensely felt for Shyamalan's previous movies. The scenes just didn't flow for me. Rather than a smooth transition from scene to scene, it felt like a collage of scene snippets shown one after another while maintaining sequence. In fact, I found that some parts of the movie were pointless and unnecessary. What is the purpose of introducing the possibility of a romance between Edward Walker and Alice Hunt that doesn't end up going anywhere?

Throughout the movie, the theater occasionally filled with laughter. Near the beginning of the movie, I was thinking: 'would these high school kids just cut it out? It's supposed to be a horror movie. If you need to calm yourself to relieve your fear by laughing it off then you shouldn't be watching in the first place'. However, as the movie wore on, I couldn't help but join in myself, as some scenes turned out to prompt for laughter despite the movie's solemn theme.

It is a shame that the 109 minutes had to be split in n-ways amongst such a classy cast consisting of: William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Bryce Dallas Howard, Adrien Brody, Joaquin Phoenix... Save for Bryce Dallas Howard, this movie barely gave any of them a chance to warm up, let alone deliver a star performance. Until about halfway into the movie, you really can't pinpoint exactly who the main character is. This is perhaps the reason why this movie does not move you in the same way as Shyamalan's previous movies, where the audience bonds with the main character (eg. Bruce Willis in 6th sense/Unbreakable, Mel Gibson in Signs) right away and gets absorbed into the plot. The only thing that can possibly salvage this movie is Bryce Dallas Howard's convincing performance as Ivy Walker, a blind young woman that was somehow able to 'see' colours in people.

The scenes inside the forest reminded me of the Blair Witch Project -one of the worst movies I have ever seen. At the end of the movie, I was asking myself, which was worse? The Village or the Blair Witch Project? The Village is better, but not by much. The ending might seem intelligent to some, but to me, it is not at all surprising. It was just another Ah-huh to go along with the rest of the movie.

If someone dares you to watch it in hopes to give you nightmares, dare them back not to laugh during the movie.",1091577600,14,3471,4.605177993527508

A few parts made me jump, but it isn't that scary compared to ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs.""",1091577600,,421,3.9647058823529413
2167889,3,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie takes us to the late-19th century town of Covington. A town surrounded by woods that have creatures prowling in them. It seems that the townspeople have an understanding with these creatures: if the townspeople stay out of their woods, they will stay out of their town. And so, this community has thrived safely for many years. But, there are younger folk in the village that think they can safely pass through the woods into the outer towns if their intentions are pure. They reason that the creatures will see this pureness and let them pass. This is the argument that Lucius (Phoenix) presents to the elders. Of course, the elders forbid it, fearing for not only his safety, but the villagers' as well. When Those We Don't Speak Of enter the village one night, the elders take this as a sign that they must stay out of the woods. Soon it becomes a matter of life or death that the blind girl Ivy (Howard) pass throught the woods on a quest to the towns, and she must muster up her courage to deal with the beings in the woods.

 If you have seen the trailer for this movie, and thing you know what the movie is about, you are wrong. There are few scary moments in this movie, but they are very effective. Instead, the movie focuses on the love triangle (of sorts) between Lucious, Ivy, and the town idiot Noah (Brody). Their relationship drives the events of the movie, and all three do an excellent job with their characters. The biggest role of the three, surprisingly, is Ivy's. Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's daughter), in her first starring role is what makes this movie work. As for the expected Shuamalan twists, there are two. One did not surprise me and one sort of did. There is no revelation here along the lines of ""The Sixth Sense"", and that is probably what everyone will be waiting for. Despite the good acting, there really is not too much here. It is not a bad film, but it is not great either. Instead, it falls somewhere in the OK range. Unfortunate, but at least it gives Howard a platform to show that she has what it takes to be a great actress.",1091577600,6,2107,4.47012987012987

2167892,5,B00064LJVO,"It is 1897 in Covington, PA. There, a small group of puritan-esque settlers have made their home, surrounded on all sides by dense woodlands. An uneasy truce exists between the settlers, and the creatures that live in the woods--don't enter the woods, and they'll stay out of the village, that's the deal. So when small animals appear in the town, dead and skinned from the neck down, the people suspect the creatures have encroached the borders of their town.

 Shyamalan has already established himself as a suspense artist very much akin to Alfred Hitchcock. Like Hitchcock, Shyamalan always works himself into the film as some obscure character. And like Hitchcock, Shyamalan's films are less about what makes your skin crawl, but about people.

 The people of Covington live sheltered lives. People are forbidden to pass beyond the woods, even when, after the death of a young boy, one young man requests permission to seek medicines from outside townships. They are a people of virtue and pride, marked by a flawed, but devout, servanthood and nobility. And, to their credit, they exhibit the finer qualities of humanity.

 The film's real jewel is actress Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's daughter). Her character seeks to aid the life of her true love, which hangs in the balance throughout the latter half of the film. Her traits of self-sacrifice and love serve as a refreshing example to many who still struggle with the notion that love is not a feeling, but an action.

 Woodland terrors are less conventional than ESP and alien invaders (two things that have a long mainstay in American pop-culture, and were the subjects of Shyamalan's previous films), so the film's twists may seem a little watered down. But again, it's wrong to think the movie runs simply to trip you up in the end. This film is a tribute to the basest, most forgotten human quality, our ability to conquer our fears to help someone other than ourselves. ""Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends"" (John 15:13 NIV).",1091577600,8,2037,4.85014409221902
2167893,4,B00064LJVO,"The photography and the performance of the new star, Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy, are absolutely great. The plot is mildly surprising but isn't particularly full of intrigues. Many, me included, might feel actually a bit cheated as the much awaited ""truth"" is finally revealed near the end. It's not because the story as a whole is bad; but it's because of the way the movie is marketed, of what we have come to expect from a Shyamalan movie, and most importantly of Shyamalan's misplaced focus in most of the movie.

 Give the same story to other directors, I am sure most likely most would prefer to treat it as essentially a drama and accordingly downplay the ""mysterious"" elements in the plot. It's actually a shame that what could have been a beautiful movie (the romance part of the story and the stunning visuals) was unfortunately turned into a mystery that cheats, and a horror flick that offers only empty scares.

 The gothic atmosphere created in the first two thirds of the movie is great. I felt totally engrossed, and couldn't wait to be led to find out the ""truth."" But disappointingly, this first part of the movie promises far much more than what the story could subsequently deliver (in short, the movie cheats). Since nothing great, in terms of the revelation of the ""truth,"" is in store, and I cannot help wondering why the director seems totally happy to build up the audience's hope in the first place. To me, it almost feels like dishonest tease.

 ""Sixth Sense"" has most of its story independent of the movie's final surprise. So even if some smart audience thinks the twist is predictable and cheap, they would not feel cheated and question the integrity of the movie. The surprise is an extra treat and something that gives the movie an additional rich layer of texture. But ""The Village,"" ""Unbreakable"" and to smaller extent ""Signs"" all have their stories orbit around their respective ""twists."" And unfortunately those twists are not all that satisfying, hence rendering those movies neither refreshing nor extremely likable.

 With his tremendous craftsmanship in creating atmosphere and the movie's great cast, I believe ""The Village"" would have been a much better piece should Shyamalan have not sacrificed the focus on the dramatic elements in favor of the disappointingly empty mystery. In fact, I find myself enjoying the movie most in the last half hour of the movie after the ""twist"" has been revealed.",1091491200,5,2438,4.886198547215496
2167894,4,B00064LJVO,"I have been accused often enough of ""expectation bias"" coloring my reactions to films.  You know, that's where you go into a film experience expecting (usually) to love it based on a particular actor, writer or director who has thrilled you in the past.  Usually, your standards are so artificially high after all the anticipation that you are almost guaranteed a letdown when you actually see that film.  Then a reverse halo effect takes place in which you find fault with everything in the movie, from the acting on down to the scenery.  You're disappointed, so it all just blew.

Strangely enough, although I loved M. Night Shyamalan's previous films, I was not especially disappointed with this departure from his usual subject matter and plotting in The Village.  I enjoyed it despite the fact that it was quite different from what I had been anticipating.  On the other hand this latest offering from the mysterious director of Signs, Unbreakable and Sixth Sense has some well-known movie reviewers practically slinging venom through cyberspace.  What gives?

This story takes place in a nameless village somewhere in the eastern region of the US, possibly a cult of some sort, and is set in an undetermined time that looks as if it could be the mid-1800s.  An uneasy truce between the villagers and the enigmatic denizens of the surrounding forest has been in place for an unspecified time, unbroken ""for many years"".  We don't see the beings for a good portion of the film, which allows our imaginations to build them up as we speculate:  Werewolves?  Aliens?  Goblins?  One thing's for sure, they're large and predatory, and if you cross their boundaries they're also vengeful.  So naturally, some id10t villager decides to mess with this pact and breach the woods.  Now, at the worst possible moment, a young man is critically wounded and in need of more advanced medicine from the towns beyond the forest, but of course that would mean aggravating the creatures even more and endangering the life of the person who goes to fetch the drugs.

The acting was good in some cases and wonderful for the most part.  I like the fact that while there was a good representation of power names among the cast, the true hero of the story is played by an unknown, Dallas Bryson Howard, with a genuine feel for what makes a smart and determined young woman tick.  For out of the entire town it is Ivy the blind girl who rises to the challenge of saving Lucius in the name of love.  Unbelievably, Ivy is given permission by the Elders to set off alone on her mission with two escorts who must stay back when she gets to the main road. A bit hard to credit, but then wait until you see the kind of savvy the creatures are dealing with in the person of Ivy.

The main thing that will disappoint the overly hyped up public, I believe, is the fact that this plot is a Thriller rather than Horror or Speculative Fiction.  It's as if once a director starts off his career in a particular direction, he isn't ""allowed"" by the fans - or mainstream movie critics, for that matter -- to evolve in any other genre.  Get over it, people. I can just hear the praise to high heavens from the professional critics had this movie been made by a newbie director. And yes it has a few too-convenient plot flaws and features people with a more innocent, sedentary mentality than we normally encounter, so what?  Enjoy The Village for the Hitchcock-inspired mood piece that it is, if you are capable of checking your preconceived notions (and game boys) at the door first.

The Village will appeal to anybody who appreciates films like Brotherhood of the Wolf, Memento and Identity.  Recommended with some (few) reservations.

2167895,3,B00064LJVO,"The Village is M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie that, by now, has become something of a shtick - there's always a twist at the end. At some point Night's going to get tired of all this and, like Sam Raimi, will hopefully go on to produce some really great movies that do not have to have a surprising ending. Unfortunately, it seems Night's success has now pigeonholed him and with The Village, the cracks are starting to show.

 I appreciate a good surprise twist, but I'm not that easy to fool. I figured out who the real suspect was in The Usual Suspects. The Blair With Project and Fargo did not fool me into thinking they were true stories. But one of the few movies that really did surprise me with the ending was the Sixth Sense, so I gave Night the benefit of the doubt. I loved Unbreakable and liked Signs.

 In all three cases, what was great about Night's movies is that they take time to focus on characters. People live their daily lives and then a supernatural element is injected into it. Even better, each plot is easy to summarize in a sentence. I imagine this comes in handy when pitching it to movie studios. For example:

 Sixth Sense: Ghosts.

 Unbreakable: Superheroes.

 Signs: Aliens.

 And The Village? ""Little Red Riding Hood""

 Or rather, ""Little Yellow Riding Hood."" The movie begins in 1897, focusing on a sleepy Amish-like town where a child has just died. Everyone dresses in black, white, brown, and gray and talks very, very slowly. Nobody uses conjunctions - it's all ""You can not,"" never ""You can't.""

 The characters live out their lives on the screen. Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard, the strikingly beautiful progeny of Ron Howard, who can actually act) is a blind girl in a man's world. She is fearless, in a town that brooks no violence and that is isolated from the rest of the civilization. It is Ivy's blindness and the repetition of the town's activities that sets her free, allowing her to roam as much as anyone who is sighted since things almost never change.

 And oh yeah, she can see the color of peoples' auras. Or something like that.

 Ivy has a boon companion in the personage of Noah Percy (Adrien Brody), a Pee-Wee-like character who probably suffers from severe attention-deficit disorder. Child-like and tempestuous, he wears his emotions on his sleeve. He's quite smitten with Ivy, a point that becomes relevant later.

 Into this curious relationship enters our protagonist for the first half of the movie, Lucius Hunt, played by Joaquin Phoenix. Am I the only one freaked out that Phoenix also played Commodus in Gladiator, who had a nephew named Lucius? Anyway...Phoenix's character is a staid sort who barely talks at all and he plays him with restraint.

 The patriarch of the town is Ivy's father, Edward Walker (William Hurt). He is most noteworthy for being the slowest talker of all. Indeed, this seems like the role Hurt was made for - his slow, methodical approach to everything is perfect for this movie. As opposed to say, Lost in Space.

 In the background lurks...something. They are the others, the outsiders, literally big bad wolves in red hoods. Are they werewolves? Aliens? Actors who needed the money? I'm not telling, you'll have to see it for yourself. But what's certain is that they live beyond the borders of the village. To go outside in their territory is to provoke them to violence. All the villagers live in fear of them...everyone except Lucius and Noah. When they stray outside the boundaries of the town, the others start showing up in the town to spread signs that they are not happy.

 The plot thickens when Ivy and Lucius decide to marry. Tempers flare, someone gets hurt, and the movie finally shifts gears to be what we were hoping it to be: a scary mystery where half the fun is figuring out what's going on.

 When Lucius gets hurt, Ivy must journey into the beyond, violating all the rules she's been told about. And she must do it alone, a blind girl wandering through the woods. Forget the scary boogiemen, the poor girl could trip and spear herself in the eye by accident. That's scary enough.

 The problem is that the journey is the real meat of the movie and it takes so long to get there. There is one particularly frightening moment in the film that far exceeds the twist (hint: it involves a knife). It's so sudden and so shocking that it certainly made the film worth seeing. Night knows how to shock and, by now, he knows it doesn't have to come in a surprise ending.

 And yet, the surprise ending is there like a big, inevitable sign at the end of a long, circuitous road. If you play close enough attention, you'll start to see the signs clearly enough that give it away. I figured it about halfway through the film (another hint: my dad's an architect).

 Having guessed the final twist, the rest is a long, drawn out denouement. Yes, this movie is a story about trying to run away from the evil inherent in all humanity. On some level, Night seems to say, you can take the man out of violence, but you can't take the violence out of man. Okay, fine. But must it take so long to get that point across? And must Night lie to make the twist more effective?

 Good movie making means maintaining a willing suspension of disbelief. Fargo, and The Blair Witch project all provided us with info that wasn't accurate - and in both cases, the effect was chilling. Here, it feels like a cheap trick. When Night makes a cameo explaining all the other plot holes in his surprise ending, he starts to sound defensive.

 This movie should have been a retelling of Little Red Riding Hood's journey. Instead, we get a Twilight Zone episode not worth seeing twice.",1091491200,7,5666,4.610169491525424
2167896,4,B00064LJVO,"When I saw ""The Village,"" many in the audience were disappointed, as if Shyamalan had finally laid an egg. Well, like all his first three movies, there is a surprise twist to the plot, though not so mind-boggling as in any of his first three films (even including ""Signs""); the acting, writing, and directing is carefully thought out and well-executed; the music supports the story; and the ending gives the viewer a sense of release.

 But the dnouement isn't all that captivating, and the story is not satisfying enough to support Shyamalan's apparent 'make-the-viewer-wait-ten-years-between-each-spoken-line' directing method.

 His writing in Sixth Sense and Unbreakable was outstanding, and in Signs, darn good. In The Village, it's just very good. I have to admit I was expecting more, but that may not be fair given Shyamalan's previous great works; maybe I was expecting too much, given the high standard. But this movie should succeed better in Europe, where the moviegoing audience isn't so addicted to Hollywood razzle-dazzle.

2167898,4,B00064LJVO,"There is so much bad word of mouth out there about ""The Village"" that I had to go see it by myself because nobody wanted to see it with me. I avoided all the publicity about M. Night Shyamalan's fourth film so that I could make up my own mind. Besides, if the whole point is to see whether he can fool us again, why would you want to know anything on the chance that it would be too much? If the film gets spoiled by a review, then that is hardly giving the film a chance. Even when Penn & Teller show you how they do their trick, they get to do the trick first.

 The Village is located in a valley surrounding by Covington Woods. The year is 1897 according to the tombstone we see at the start of the film. As we are introduced to life in the community we learn about the strange rules under which its inhabitants live. If you did not read the rules on the poster for ""The Village,"" they are enacted during the first part of the film. Red is a bad color that cannot be seen because it attracts them, while mustard yellow is a color of safety. No one can enter the woods because that is where those of whom no one speaks will get you. If the warning bell is sounded, then head for the cellars in your houses immediately because they are coming.

 A council of elders run the village, and their leader is clearly Edward Walker (William Hurt). They set the tone for the village, but in the wake of the death of a young child because of sickness, young Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) wants to leave the village, travel through the forbidden woods, and bring back medicine from one of the towns on the other side. Lucius is uncommonly brave. The young boys test their courage by standing on a stump on the border between the village and the woods, and Lucius is the record holder. But his courage could doom the Village by breaking the truce that has held between the two sides for many years.

 Most of that you can pick up from the trailers for ""The Village."" Joaquin Phoenix as Lucius is clearly the hero of the film and you know know that there is no reason to set up these rules if they are not going to get violated as a major plot development in the film. Beyond that it is difficult to say anything that would not interfer with your chance to enjoy the film on its own terms. However, there are two things I can say.

 First, given that he has backed himself in a corner it terms of always having to come up with some big secret twist for all of his films, Shyamalan does try to come up with something to meet the raised expectations. You can certainly decide afterwards that the secret was not big enough or good enough, but unless the film has been spoiled for you I cannot believe you are going to see everything that is coming. As we know from ""Signs"" and the rest of his films if there is one thing Shyamalan can do it is that everything fits together in the end.

 Second, as I started to get into this film I decided that the character I really liked was Ivy Walker, played by Bryce Dallas Howard. That is the one name that appears in the opening credits that I did not recognize (remember, I avoided all the publicity) and so when it turned out that Bryce was playing Ivy, and that the actress is the daughter of Ron Howard I was surprised (no wonder she looked familiar without my recognizing her). This is a breakthrough performance, which may well be the only thing that everybody who sees ""The Village"" is going to agree on.

 Early on in this film I decided what I wanted this film to be, not expecting that it would actually end up being that, so when it did I was both surprised and gratified. Since I never put much significance into the meaning of Shyamalan's movie twists, focusing instead on whether or not I could be fooled, ""The Village"" certainly meets the criteria. He got me.

2167900,3,B00064LJVO,"The Village (M. Night Shyamalan, 2004)

The first thing that needs to be said about The Village is that it's miles better than Signs. Which wouldn't, actually, have been all that hard. But you know how these things go. It's not Unbreakable or The Sixth Sense, but it'll do for the moment.

The best thing about this movie is the casting. Shyamalan has pulled some of the best of the A-list (Shyamalan regular Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver, Adrien Brody), a former A-lister working his way back up (William Hurt), and a number of underrated who should be on the A-list (Brendan Gleeson, Michael Pitt, Celia Weston, etc.), and topped them all off with Bryce Dallas Howard in her first leading role. Kind of like taking a cast featuring a bunch of veteran actors and then putting Mark Hammill in the lead role.

It's not an invalid comparison. Shyamalan often seems to emulate his elders; his Hitchcockian penchant for putting himself in every film has been commented on many thousands of times (here, it's particularly egregiously Hitchcockian), for example. Moreso, however, because Shyamalan, like George Lucas before him, pulls it off. Howard may edge a bit into melodrama a time or two, but for the most part she very much holds her own against the giants around her.

None of those are more giant than Brendan Gleeson in the movie's opening scene. One of the best openers in movies in recent years, in fact. Gleeson's performance is so perfect, so understated, that what follows is either the best movie ever or an anticlimax.

The Village, unfortunately, is the latter. The story centers around (duh) a village who, according to the schoolteacher (Hurt), have a truce with a race of things that live in the surrounding woods. (No one knows what these things are, but they're large and ugly.) They don't come into the village, and the villagers don't go into the woods. Except that one of the townsmen, Lucius Hunt (Phoenix), has discovered that his mentally challenged friend Noah (Brody) has wandered into the woods without the creatures getting mad, and he thinks he, too, might be able to go through to bring back some of the benefits of late nineteenth century civilization, like new medicines. The creatures, however, are not happy with Lucius' idea...

it's a good idea for a story, and the Twilight Zone comparisons are accurate (The Village, like every episode of the original Twilight Zone, deals with the causes and effects of human isolation). Shyamalan also knows when to twist things, and twist them he does; this is just as good a twist as The Sixth Sense had. Where Shyamalan has gone wrong is in his inability to appreciate subtlety any longer; after The Sixth Sense, fans and critics spent weeks arguing over the movie's use of the color red. In The Village, he just spells it all out for you. It'd be pathetic were it not so annoying.

The end result: see it, but wait for the DVD. ***",1091491200,4,2911,4.775347912524851
2167901,4,B00064LJVO,"Nothing is worse than people who ""review"" a movie based on what their expectations for that film were, rather than just looking at the movie by itself. That, and people who (for some reason) want to be overly-critical of a brilliant new writer / director so much as to try to tear down everything he does.

 People who say this was a ""horrible movie...worst of the year,"" obviously have either another agenda in mind or simply do not understand good storytelling. My advice to you is to leave your emotional overreactions under your bed with your Yoda underoos.

 ""The Village"" was never meant to be a horror movie. It was never advertised as a horror movie. M. Night Shyamalan has never even MADE a horror movie, so I don't understand why people were expecitng this to be such.

 Shyamalan is a great storyteller who crafts very simple and personal stories around elements of the supernatural or twisty plots to add entertainment value. Mission accomplished with ""The Village"". There are enough chilling and intense moments to keep the viewer rivited to the screen, all while the story plays out.

 The story revolves around an isolationist society of a village surrounded by dense woods that are ""haunted"" by a horrible secret that threatens the well being of every inhabitant. When the time comes where it is necessary for that truce to be broken and the woods must be breached, the fate of the village and their protected society is at risk.

 Joaquin Phoenix and William Hurt give great performances as leaders in the village. But, the true eye-catcher is the dazzling performace given by newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard. Her presence will rivet the viewer to the screen.

 Overall, one of the best crafted and engaging films I have seen this summer. It goes to show that digital effects and superheroes are not necessary to produce a good old-fashioned movie.",1091491200,3,1862,4.839116719242902
2167902,4,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" is a modern day fable, an allegory set in the Pennsylvania woods. The components for a chilling horror film are present, but to me Shyamalan's work presented it throughout as an updated Puritan adventure.

 The acting performances are splendidly nuanced, especially newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard in the role of the young girl Ivy, daughter of the schoolteacher/leader. Joaquin Phoenix also does a commendable job in the role of Ivy's self-contained, courageous lover.

 It's not much of a stretch to link the community's fear of the
 malicious creatures hidden in the nearby woods, to our fear of terrorist attacks. Viewers can ponder the similarities and draw their own conclusions.",1091491200,2,717,5.3097345132743365
2167903,4,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan, at this point, can generally only be compared with himself and by that standard this ranks below Sixth Sense but above Signs and Unbreakable. The tease of the twist is more effective but, even more important, the movie has more heart than the previous two.  The love triangle, of sorts, is handled beautifully and that allows the creeping and chilling thrills to be felt all the more strongly and emotionally.  The direction is perfect as always.  Every gesture, movement and, even, colour is done to drawn the viewer into the moment the director is creating.  Shymalan knows how to use the medium of film far better than most working directors in a very Spielbergian way.  The story does ultimately have some unexplained holes which may lessen repeated viewings of it.  It will be interesting to see this director tackle someone else's story.  It can only serve to help him grow and that will be a good thing for all movie goers.",1091491200,2,950,4.7560975609756095

2167905,5,B00064LJVO,"If you come into this movie expecting a thriller, action-a-minute horror flick, you will be disappointed: otherwise, you will love it! This movie is a rather slow-moving period piece that tells the tale of a remote village surrounded by Coventry Wood: and creatures so terrible they are referred to only as ""those of whom we do not speak"". The creatures are attracted to the color red (blood), simply called ""the bad color,"" and boundaries are set up all around the perimeter of the village, in hopes of keeping them out.

 A long-standing truce between the villagers and the creatures of the wood is in danger of being broken when one of the villagers dares to cross the boundaries and angers them. When the villagers find dead, skinned animals strewn about and awake to red slashes in blood across their doors, they are afraid of what may come. Tragedy through violence again strikes the little village, and one of the villagers will be tempted to cross the yellow boundaries into the wood to travel to ""the towns"" to retrieve help: but doing this may bring consequences unlike any they have ever known...

 For those of you worried about content: there are some intense moments, lots of suspense, but surprisingly little objectionable content. This movie is not a gory horror flick, but rather tame in that aspect: there are dead, skinned & bloody animals strewn about, some violence and blood, and very little language to speak of. The scary and adult themes of this film make it unfit for young children, but the content is actually quite clean.

 This film was well-acted, with stellar performances by Adrien Brody, Joaquin Phoenix, and newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard. My advice: pause a moment to enjoy this slow-moving yet intense suspense flick!",1091491200,4,1752,4.902027027027027

2167907,5,B00064LJVO,"Unfortunately I started by reading some of the other reviews in this thread, somthing no one who wants to write their own review should do.

That being said, I see what the problem is with people who rate this movie low.  The problem is that they went into the film expecting one thing, a horror, and were disappointed.  Well, you know what the say about people who 'assume' things...

What people don't realise is that Shayamalan has never made a 'horror' movie.  Well, I can concede arguements about Sixth Sense although it was way beyond that, but Unbreakable was in no way horrific, and Signs wasn't even really about aliens, go figure.  So why people went to see The Village expecting some super horrific thrill-fest is beyond me. Shayamalan is the smartest, wittiest writter/director out there, and what you will get if you go to see this movie is exactly that, a very intelligent, engaging piece of cinima.

The acting in this movie was brilliant.  Absolutely gorgeous, which could be a draw to this film all by itself.

Here's a tip for the next Shayamalan film.  Find out when it's being released, and then don't make any further assumptions.  I, personally, don't want to know beforehand what any of his films are about.  I want to go in a virgin and experience it without preconceived notions.  That way I can avoid all assumptions, and the embarassments that come with them.",1091491200,12,1386,4.725

Shyamalan seems to think he can make any movie and the audience will fall for it. The Village is an example of this. The only merit of this movie is the actors and setting. The story goes nowhere.",1091491200,6,415,4.608108108108108
2167909,5,B00064LJVO,"The village is M. Night Shyamalan's 4th film. It was originally known as ""The Woods"", but Shyamalan thought ""The Village"" was a better title. The film wasn't as intense as ""Signs"" and ""the six sense"" (unbreakable wasn't really intense) but this film had more dept and great cinematography, which made the film great. The acting is perfect for the mood and atmosphere, the cinematography of the village and the woods is amazing for the environment and the message is completely relevant. Virtually no special effects were used, just nothing but brilliant camera work by Shyamalan. In this film you would notice that the way the village people talk is sort of like a Shake Spear terms. Like ""how are thou?"" and terms similar to that kind of way of speaking.

The basic plot of this movie is the village is overall perfect except for the fact that evil creatures surround them. When one noble man gets hurt, his fianc must cross through the woods to the town where she can find medicine for his wounds. She has to go through hell to get her fianc treatment. It is a brilliant movie with cameos that will definitely make you jump! The ending kind of leads to a sequel, but the success of the film will determine that, and if Shyamalan wants to make it.

This film I definitely recommend to anyone who loves great movies. Approaching the end of the movie, it might get a bit confusing because flashbacks and scene switching aren't clearly obvious, but that may be for just some people. Help yourself not to miss one moment of this film because you will regret it towards the end of the film where you don't know what is going on. This is one of those films you really have to pay close attention too, or else soon after the film you won't know what is going on. That is another reason why this film is so great and brilliant. This film you should definitely see and do not list to the negative reviews. There are a lot of surprises in this film, but the biggest one yet is how much you'll love this film.",1091404800,4,1999,4.473972602739726
2167910,4,B00064LJVO,"DO NOT go to this film expecting what you may have heard about it. All of the hype was pretty much over nothing. For instance, there are no creatures that live in the dark, threatening woods. If you go to this film expecting this, you will have paid for your ticket in vain - and you'll be really pissed once it's all over.

 What we do have is simply a very haunting social commentary. I don't want to say anymore than that for fear that I may give out one of the many ""twists"" in the film. It's a beautiful film, and you'll think about it long after its over. Ron Howard's daugther - Bryce Dallas Howard - can ACT. She was excellent, and I think that she should be nominated for an Oscar. Yes, she was THAT good. Everyone else in the cast was great. Sigourny Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, and Celia Weston were all captivating. I didn't find the film slow at all, but many people who go to see it will see it that way.

 In short, the film didn't meet my expectations by any means, and I was angry after the credits rolled. Really angry. In fact, I felt cheated out of my money. I wanted a refund in the worst way. However, later on I thought about everything that I had just seen, and realized that it was an interesting concept, was very thought-provoking, and in its own unique way, very creepy. I believe that I may go see it again so I can look at it in this mind-set. I'll probably enjoy it alot more.

 Oh, yeah. The score by James Newton Howard was awesome!

The Village is a movie that, I suppose, many can appreciate for the effort put forth, but even that I find sadly lacking. I give the talents in this movie much credit, but even they could not save it from the predictibility the plot, the entire movie, followed. The 'twists' in this movie I felt everyone could see coming, and they weren't any more new than when they were tried in the fifties with the Twilight Zone. The director is competent. Despite my unwillingness to see Signs, I saw it, and enjoyed it, surprisingly. This movie I would not see again, even if you paid me. I feel the romance was flat, and so was the suspense. Oftentimes, instead of building tension, he goes for the quick scares, and it's more annoying than truly terrifying. I had hoped, with all the hype surrounding this movie, it would come out smelling like roses, like his many efforts before. Some of the characters completely fall flat, and some of them, while not entirely uninteresting, lose your favor and attention halfway through the movie.

It is impossible to review this movie properly without a spoiler, so there's your warning.  The monsters are poorly done, and the final scenes borrow in a failing manner from ""The Blair witch Project.""  In fact, there are several derivative scenes to the movie.

My suggestion, instead of seeing this movie, wear a blindfold next to the percussion practice rooms of your local high school; and tell the drummers to once in a while bang the drum next to your ear.  It'll save you the eight bucks and provide a bigger scare.  Mind you, I hate saying this because the acting was good, the cinematography was good, and it was an attractive looking film.

It's too bad because it was a good movie, but because of the LIE most people are disappointed.

The people of Covington have solemnly sworn a pact with ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"" that the humans will not enter the woods and ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"" will not enter the village. The people in Covington do not have appropriate medical care as they know there are medicines in the towns beyond the woods. A young man Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) requests to enter the woods and get the medicine, but his request is denied. One day Lucius enters the fringe of the woods, and he is seen by one of ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"", and the following evening they enter the town to warn the people about entering the woods.

 If you have seen any of M. Night Shyamalan's other films you are aware that he is plot twister and might change the whole concept of the film. This is no exception to the Shyamalan rule as the film will give some interesting ideas of how ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"" came about. It might indulge the audience to ponder some ideas from Thomas Moore and other sociopolitical aspects as it could affect the outcome of the film. Many viewers who went to see it might have been affected by the great media hype that has surrounded the film as it could not have been avoided if one traffics the internet or watches television. In the end, The Village offers a pretty good cinematic event, if the audience lets down their guard and lets the film tell the story as the audience ponders the ""why's?'",1091404800,3,1617,4.315789473684211

Let me start off with this, DO NOT GO INTO THIS MOVIE EXPECTING THE SIXTH SENSE OR SIGNS! If you do you will guarantee yourself with a dissapointment. This movie shows a different side of M. Night Shyamalan, the more poetic and literary side of him rather than the dark and suspenseful side. Don't get me wrong, you're guaranteed to jump more than once and there is a handful of tense moments, but the truth of the movie is where the purpose lies. The movie is about the simplicities of life and the human emotions that come with it. If you think about it there is an extended metaphor within the movie. These people are almost governed by the creatures of the woods. Because of these creatures, boundries are set, limitations to their way of life are set, and there is the constant fear of death if someone were to break these set ways. Coming back to human nature, Shyamalan really only explores two human emotions; life and love. There is also the mild exploration of fear and death, and how by fearing death it forces us to enjoy life and love, but I'm getting way too into it here. The only downside of the movie is actually the ending, but it's funny because the ending is also the key to the movie. But how can the movie be good if the ending is bad? Simply put, the ending works. It really does. The thing about the ending is that the ending itself lowers the credibility of the movie by being a little too absurd. You can expect the Shyamalan Formula here, he'll throw all the answers at you first and then present you with the questions and then hit you with the final thing that makes it work. This is where people start becoming dissapointed because its not something huge like The Sixth Sense or Signs, but something subtle and meaningful in a real way, not fictional.

ACTING: There are no aging action stars in this movie, but there are some veteran actors and a newcomer who all pull it off quite nicely. The big names here are William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, and Joaquin Pheonix. Adrien Brody has his 2nd major role since The Pianist playing a mentally challenged resident of the village. The fresh new face here is Academy Award Winner Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard. She makes a very smooth transition into the acting world and you'd think that she's been acting for a while when this is her first major role. There really is no main character here and you feel that, no one actor has a noticeably large amount of screen time and that works. Mel and Bruce were the stars of the previous entries in Shyamalan's filmography, but even with the big names everyone is treated equally here. This will make more sense once you see the ending.

BOTTOM LINE: People expecting another thriller will be dissapointed, instead try a new flavor. Enjoy this meaningful poetic film for what its really meant for, not for suspense or scares but for exploring the one thing that confuses us the most. . . ourselves.",1091404800,4,3055,4.522603978300181

Thank god this movie was made because I loved every minute of it. No, it's NOT a horror movie. If you wanted a horror movie, go see Freddy vs. Jason or some piece of garbage like that. This is a suspenseful drama with a couple of very good twists that happens to have monsters in it.

People who are putting this movie down so much obviously aren't at the level it's at. I reccomend they go see a real waste of film such as White Chicks,13 going on 30, or I Robot. People should be thankful we have The Village.",1091404800,4,768,4.439716312056738
2167919,4,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan, while only slightly holding onto his knack for jolts and screams, has created a film that is a tribute to his maturation as a filmmaker.

 While 'The Sixth Sense' still remains a better work, both in its unexpectedness and it's simple yet amazing production, 'The Village' has its merits.

 As one would expect, the cinematography and direction are gripping and superb. The script, in a way that is, to say the least, not modern seems forced coming from the mouths of the modern actors. However, this may all be part of the plan, the plot. Instead of the major twist that is almost unforeseeable coming at the end of his other films, `The Village' has multiple turns in plot. First, the viewer is led to believe one thing, then another, then another. And the emanated knowledge that a twist is on its way does wonders for eliminating suspense - a great fault of film's almost too simple plot.

 However, Interesting camera angles and what seems to be ""normal"" editing, create a beautiful town of people. They are completely engulfed in their lives in a small meadow surrounded by a forest that they do not enter. They are na?ve, innocent, happy.

 The acting talent is underused and does not compare to the superb quality of the Oscar nominated cast of 'The Sixth Sense.' However, after the viewer lets go of the fact that Kirsten Dunst was originally casted to play Ivy, and that her role is unlike many seen on the silver screen, Bryce Dallas Howard shines like a true rising star. Her gentleness coupled with the role's strength of character could not be more perfect. Adrien Brody demonstrates that he is more than just a dramatic actor, even though his role is quite dramatic, while Joaquin Phoenix, without words for much of the film, demonstrates that acting is more than just memorization of scripted lines. Most of the other characters are underdeveloped in an especially disturbing form. They are part of a community, a village. Yet, the sense of community is only depicted in the most visual form. Besides a few very personal connections, the actors seemed to be distanced from their characters, and the characters from each other.

 The previews are necessarily deceiving. They neither ruin nor comment on the true nature of the plot. However, you should not expect something whole-heartedly jolting. This is not a horror. I jumped (three times) granted, due to the stereotypical mounting of high pitched strings paired with moments of intense action. However, the film should be looked at as a drama that truly looks into the nature of humanity.

 Though the film seems empty and shallow, thinking back has made me realize the multiple levels on which Shyamalan speaks. It is a beautiful film and I would gladly see `The Village' again, and that is a true testament to the greatness of filmmaking.",1091404800,2,2830,4.824380165289257

The twist at the end is brilliant but i would have preferred the creatures to have been real, and maybe a different perspective on the whole thing you know.  The creatures arne't real, i thought they should have been, it would make it more intersting, then just having the elders make them up to keep everybody in a safe world.

2167922,2,B00064LJVO,"I was so excited about seeing The Village. I go to one or two movies a week, because there is nothing else to do in the small town I live in. I've seen almost 40 movies this year, and by far The Village is the most disappointing movie of the year. The movie is nothing like what it's been sold and advertised on for the last six months.

 The Village is supposed to take place in Covington,PA in 1897. the citizens of Covington live in a small valley surrounded by a forest. They can't leave the forest because of the beasts or ""They who we do not speak of"" live there.

 The Studio and M. Night Shyamalan begged the critcs not to reveal anymore of the plot than that. I can see why they wanted that for a bunch of reasons. The movie has a lot of plot twists and the story takes some major changes. If you knew about the changes you probaly won't enjoy the movie as much. Or in my case If I had known I wouldn't have wasted my money.

 The movie is sold as one of the scariest movies you will ever see. It's by far anything but that. That ideal really blew me off to the movie. For the last six months all we've seen in the trailers and advertising is how scary this is. I jumped once in the movie, and the crowd only reacted to four or five scenes total. It's wrong for a studio and director to trick people into coming in and seeing there weak political statement movie.

 I did like Bryce Dallas Howard a lot in the movie. She was great as the blind girl Ivy Walker. She really runs with the movie and is brillant. She's funny in places and she's dramatic in others. It really is her movie. Joaquin Phoneix was great in the movie, well when he's in it. The guy can act and he's awesome, but this is a waste of his talents. William Hurt was also good as well. Adrien Brody wastes his Best Actor talents as the mentaly challenged Noah. Sigourney Weavers part isn't all that big either.

 The sets in The Village were great. The town looks authentic and the forest is pretty cool. The costumes are bland and boring, I know they can't do much because Red is a forbidden color. They still could have done more to make the town look so less depressing. The music was pretty good as well.

 The movie was to predictable. I guessed right almost all the major plot twists throughout the movie. I probaly would have enjoyed the movie more, except for the fact that I was expecting this big dramatic thriller, and it's nothing like that. The acting and sets are good in the movie, the story just kills it. If you like M. Night Shyamalan you really are going to be disappointed by this. This is the worst movie of the year.

However, people have come to expect bizarre and unusual surprise plot twists and/or revelations at the end of the film and if someone is not truly taken aback or shocked at the ending of the film I think that results in a lukewarm review. Truth be told ""The Sixth Sense"" was the only mainstream film he has done which had a big shocker/revelation at the end of the film. ""Signs"" seemed to me to deal more with the idea of lost faith and how fate, (providence or God), causes things to happen for a reason and makes people be where they are for a reason, (remember Gibson's brother who washed out of professional baseball and the son with asthma and how both of those conditions were in the end for the benefit of the characters). ""Unbreakable"" I found simply to be a fun movie exploring in a very real everyday way how a grown family man comes to the realization and terms with the fact that he is a superhero. ""The Village"" certainly has a twist at the ending, however, it was one that I suspected about 25 minutes into the film. This does not detract from the overall story and the quality of the film. The movie has great performances from some great performers and manages to provide a few chills, (without the necessity of the blood and gore that makes it into far too many of our films). Shyamalan may becoming a victim of his own success; the fact that a few films of his have had ""revelations"" or ""twists"" I think has encouraged viewers to expect them and anticipate them. Moreover, if the ""revelation"" or ""twist"" doesn't measure up somehow than the armchair critics bash the film. My advice: Go see the film solely for the purpose of being entertained and watching some excellent performances and maybe, just maybe, being surprised and given a few goose bumps here and there.",1091404800,,1910,4.555232558139535
2167925,4,B00064LJVO,"Overall, I think ""The Village"" was an entertaining and thoughtful movie, but I tried to go into it with an open mind, and it still was different than what I expected. I honestly think Mr. Shyamalan was trying to make a social and political statement with this movie, following in the footsteps of movies such as Mr. Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" with the fear and anger towards society that some victims of crimes will hold and how the news feeds that fear, while also showing how some groups of people might react to extreme circumstances. The ending I think was a little short-sighted (the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5), but I enjoyed the movie and it made me think afterwards, which is the most you can ask from any movie in my opinion.",1091404800,2,748,4.507352941176471
2167926,5,B00064LJVO,"I don't know why so many people are bashing The Village. I think it is his best film yet, with all his other work being good too. I guess people went into the theater waiting to see what the twist was going to be, not going there to see the movie for what it is. I have to say though, I was suprised by the twist. People are saying how some of the dialouge was laughable, some of it was was ment to be funny. As for the performances, i thought they were great, especally Bryce Dallas Howard, she was incredible, everyone was great though. Overall i would highly recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of his previous work, just don't go into the movie waiting for the twist, go ther to watch it for what it is.",1091404800,4,716,4.085106382978723
2167927,1,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan has a werid creative track record with me. I first came to know about him when he made ""The Sixth Sense"" (His third film) I saw that movie after all the hype and the surprise twist had been revealed. In case you have secluded yourself from society and have not heard about the film's ending I will not reveal it here. Overall I thought it was an okay movie that had some entertainment value, but not a movie I would want to watch again.

 His next project was ""Unbreakable"", the worst film of 2000. He than made what I feel was a much needed recovery and gave us ""Signs"" (So far his best film). And now comes ""The Village"", yet again another big disappointment. But I don't think it's as bad as ""Unbreakable"".

 I will give Shyamalan credit. He films have interesting plots that do not seem conventional. Many call him the next Hitchcock. He has explored many different genres; supernatural thrillers (""The Sixth Sense"") comedy (""Unbreakable""), sci-fi (""Signs""), and now a love story.

 ""The Village"" is about a small town in 1897 that is removed from the outside world. Everyone seems happy and it's one of those places where everyone knows each other, but, there's something odd about this village. In the woods there are creatures, or as they are referred to in the film ""Those Will Do Not Speak Of"". The people of the village have made a bargin with ""Those"", if we don't bother you, you don't bother us.

 Now in the beginning of the movie Shyamalan I must admit does give the film the atmosphere it would need to succeed. Most of the performances are worthwhile. William Hurt, Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver, and Bryce Dallas Howard (Daughter of Ron). Everyone except Adrien Brody are used to wonderful effect.

 The reason Brody is a downer is because we know nothing about his character, and what ever we do know doesn't matter, he is simply not that interesting a character.

 As the film continues it seems ""Those"" want the people to leave the town. They do this by offering signs (what these signs are I will not say). And it's here the film works. There is a level on intrigue and suspense, and for those who like to guess the twist endings to Shyamalan's films you will be hooked at this point.

 But as ""The Village"" goes on and soon layers of the plot are revealed to us my reaction at least was ""So what?"". Once the first secret is given I couldn't see the point for the film to continue. The ""twist"" is so disappointing I started asking myself what on Earth made Shyamalan think this was a good idea. If I really want to play the role of pretenious film snob I could say the movie is taking a stand against violence, but again, so what?

 ""The Village"" gets points for style but none for substance. Since many people feel Shyamalan's film only succeed depending on how good the ""twist ending"" is, this one fails.

 Lets forget the ending, because I don't think it's fair to judge his movies by the ending. There are other reasons I can give you why I didn't like this movie. Though the performances are not boring, no one is really drained to life. These people never truly seem real. I didn't care for the cinematography. I thought the plot was meander.

 What Shyalaman has done it, if I may paraphrase the movie, is make one of those movies we do not speak of due to how bad it is.

 Another thing I'd like to mention is PLEASE STOP GIVING AWAY THE FILM'S ENDING!! WHY DO YOU WANT TO SPOIL THE FILM FOR OTHERS?

 But given his track record with me, I guess this means his next film will be good (?) * 1\2 out of *****

 Bottom-line: Dull and lagging Shyamalan love story that doesn't seem anywhere as well crafted as his last film. It's not the characters that pull us in, but the plot (when we are pulled in). And about that ending......",1091404800,5,3779,4.464337700145561
2167928,4,B00064LJVO,"How many movies these days give you a story that's well told and not pure bullsh*t? Especially this summer, that has been a problem. The Village will not appeal to everyone but if you go in without expecting too much besides a good (not great) story, a few genuine scares, and quite possibly the most touching moonlit porch scene in film history, you'll be fulfilled.

 The year's prize for voiceless acting goes to Joaquin Phoenix. I mean, how could you not laugh when Ivy's sister corners him, or not totally fall in love whenever he takes Ivy's hand or just LOOKS at her? And I hope Bryce Dallas Howard has a long and illustrious career, because she is much more interesting to watch than the majority of actresses her age.

 And don't leave until the credits are done! It's not much, but if you paid the admission, you should at least see the little epilogue.

 My favorite line that came out of nowhere: ""Will you dance with me on our wedding day? I find dancing most aggreable.""",1091404800,5,984,4.531073446327683

What to say without giving IT away? It is a story about love and truth. The acting is superb (although I agree with other reviewers that the talent of Adrian Brody seemed wasted as Noah, the village idiot). Bryce Dallas Howard embodied faith and courage as young Ivy Walker, the blind heroine of the movie. The cinematography was so incredible. The subtle play of light and color added layers of meaning and emotion to every scene.

If you want fast-paced action, blood and guts, monsters - then this movie is NOT for you. Don't even bother, you'll just hate it.

However, if you want to plumb the depths of love and truth; ask yourself how far you would go for a loved one; what is morally and ethically permissible to protect a loved one, by all means see this movie.",1091404800,6,1030,4.3264248704663215
2167930,1,B00064LJVO,"What M. Night Shyamalan's new movie amounts to is a two hour Twilight Zone episode and nothing more.

 Based on advanced reviews, I was prepared that the movie was not what I thought it would be. Instead of a monster movie or even a psychological thriller ala Hitchcock, we get a 19th Century Puritan romance.

 Which would be all well and good if A)the characters were interesting, and only Ivy, played by Ron Howard's daughter, is engaging, B)if the dialgoue wasn't laughably bad (and the theatre goers I was with laughed quiet hard at the dramatic stares and the over written lines), and C)if the damn twist didn't suck.

 And it is one of the worst, most predictable twists I have ever seen. To be fair, there are two, one of which most people will see coming, the other, most won't because it's too ludicrous. I guessed it by simply joking around with my movie buddy: ""Wouldn't it be funny if...."" One hour later, I was right. And it was funny.

 Shyamalan has conditioned his audience to wait for the twist, which this time, worked to his detriment. We're all waiting for the flip/flop that transforms the meaning and the narrative of the film so much so that we have to watch it again. The problem is that only ""The Sixth Sense"" had that effect. ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"" suffered, because the twists really didn't add anything to the movie experience. (And if you're like me and thought Mel Gibson's ""Swing away"" line was ridiculous, wait until you see the infamous ending to ""The Village."" Tops it in sheer audacity and stupidity.)

 Again, I would've enjoyed the movie if the story and the characters were worth caring about. But they aren't. So I waited for the twist, in hopes it would redeem the weak story and characters. But it didn't. Is the movie as bad as people say it is?

 Yes, yes, God yes. It is embarrassingly bad. People were squirming in their seats, wondering if they were seeing a movie made by a talented filmmaker or a pretentious, labored first effort by an amateur. I think I know what Shyamalan was trying to convey with this film, but the way he sets it up completely negates whatever message he had. So I'll sum it up for you: fear is bad, especially when it's controlled by other forces and the masses are kept ignorant/innocent. Got it?

 Good, now save yourself ten bucks and see another movie.",1091404800,8,2332,4.587951807228916

2167933,2,B00064LJVO,"(Don't worry, no spoilers here.) Shyamalan, the director of three of the most interesting and well-made movies I've seen in half a decade, built his career upon a rock (The Sixth Sense). That 1999 thriller came out of the blue and captured its audience with the nuance of its narrative and...of course...that twist ending. He followed it up with Unbreakable, an underrated film that had plenty of potent drama but seemed less natural in its flow. In 2002, we got Signs, one of the finest films of that year, but another that (looking at it recently) seemed more distanced and tidy. He's made The Village now, and he's reached the end of his rope.

 The problem with The Village doesn't so much lie within its plot (well, for the first two thirds of the film). The main issue is that the persona of the director has overriden the creative material itself. We see inhabitants of a quaint little colonial village, learn that there is evil lurking in the woods surrounding it, encounter scenes that hint at that mystery...but the whole damn time, we're just thinking about how it's not what we think, how there's going to be a gigantic twist at the end, and how there are things right in front of us that are giving it away. M. Night Shyamalan has ruined his audience, and this movie simply can't recover from it.

 Lucky for us, though, the film does come with at least a few perks. Cinematographer Roger Deakins, though not at the top of his game (The Man Who Wasn't There - rent it and drool) at least lends a stark visual tone to the film. James Newton Howard's score is quite mediocre most of the time, but every once in a while a flourish of rapid violins takes it up a notch. And Bryce Dallas Howard should be able to make ends meet without the shadow of her father Ron in the way; her performance (and only her performance) is a revelation of subtlety and ease that should have been copied by the whole cast.

 But it's not, and so we get to listen to Shyamalan's ear-bleedingly awkward dialogue uttered by some of the finest actors around, and they look patently ridiculous doing it. William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, and Joaquin Phoenix all talk like HAL 9000 put his word-a-day calender to use. Village meetings and other gatherings of the like are as wooden as the structures around them, and Adrien Brody proves yet again that his best role will always be the one in The Thin Red Line...when he didn't speak.

 What about the underlying themes, the scary moments, and the plot that gets ever-so-closer to complete flip-flop? Most of those moments are kind of negated, thanks to the fact that we've been trained like Pavlov's dog to slobber for the twist by the opening credits. I was impressed with a few scenes: an early encounter with 'The Ones of Whom We Do Not Speak' (I corrected it from what it is in the movie because, well, it's grammatically incorrect) is quite suspenseful, just about any scene that Howard has is watchable, and a later chase in the woods is downright exciting if you don't think about it too much. And, oh thank God for this, an underlying theme (and mini-twist) of the movie is quite intelligent, if it only hadn't been discarded soon after.

 Let me be the first (of many) to say that the twist of the movie is stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid. Movies like The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects, and Swimming Pool exist on their own volition and are only heightened by that ""Gotcha!"" moment. This movie centers around it the entire time, and upon its unveling, it's not only downright ridiculous, but it's a wrong-headed thematic message that I found to be flat-out disgusting.

 I think I know what Shyamalan was trying to say with this movie, and it sickens me. The Village is about fear and how we cope with it (that's not giving anything away; watch the damn trailer), and what Shyamalan says with the film's final scene had me nearly as angry as I was months ago watching Von Trier's Dogville. The message of this movie is cowardly and unrealistic, and I'm sad that (1) many people won't even realize it and (2) some people might actually agree with it. This movie had its moments of above-mediocrity, but in the end it made me mad. You might not get mad, though; you might be laughing too much when that twist actually does come.

2167934,3,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shyamalan is an incredible director. He really has a knack creating films that will make you jump in your seat while keeping them with a PG-13 rating. This is because he doesn't rely on shocking amounts of gore to frighten his audience. He wraps a blanket of fear around viewers by combining suspense and expectation with jarring music and sound effects. And he drives his movies along with eerie story lines that are mysterious and always end with a twist.

Maybe that's what's wrong with The Village. It's too formulaic, but yet at the same time, it deviates too much from the formula. In the end you don't get what you expect, you get something far worse. M. Night's films rely so much on build up that if the ending doesn't pack a powerful enough punch, the whole movie goes down the drain.

In a nutshell, this film centers on a rural community in the 1890's. But this is no ordinary village. Woods surround the village, and mysterious creatures live in these woods. The villagers have always had a truce with these monsters. They don't venture into their forests, and the monsters won't venture into their village.

I loved all of M. Night's previous films, and I really thought this one was going to be great, but I was deceived. I had put too much faith in M. Night. He is, after all, only human. He has a right to screw up, but he exercises this right a little too much in The Village. This movie would've made a great episode of the twilight zone, but its not good enough to be turned into a feature length film. Parts of the movie feel empty or unnecessary. But worst of all, the monsters just seem to be a side plot.

I loved the concept for this film. In fact, I loved this film right up to about the middle of it, when my friend whispered to me his thoughts about what would happen. I thought about what he had told me, but dismissed everything he said. It just seemed too lame. Well, he was right, and that twist came far too soon.

Maybe M. Night sensed the weakness of his writing, and decided to add another twist. That's right, there are two twists. Well, they kind of come together to create one bigger twist, but they are revealed at different times during the movie. This second twist is better, but still fairly predictable, and doesn't make the movie anymore satisfying.

I loved the acting. I loved the sets. I loved the directing. I loved the concept. But the twists fall short and the movie falls apart. This movie hasn't made me lose faith in M. Night, but it has made me questioning his writing. He can keep the director's chair but perhaps its time he let someone else pick up the pen and paper.",1091404800,2,2634,4.420618556701031
2167935,5,B00064LJVO,"I'm not a big fan of M. Night Shyamalan's work, but I have to admit that I really liked this movie. I didn't think I was going to like it going into the theater and I actually didn't think I was going to like it half way through the movie, but I thought it was great.

 This movie is a love story above everything else, but I also believe that it's a metaphor of the way our (and other people's) government/ruling-class controls our information and the way we think through complex media control and subtle indoctrination to preserve their way of life and America's interests. I think the monsters represent the way our government uses the fear of terrorism/communism/whatever to keep us in line. I think that ""The Village"" is just a microcosm of the United States. In the movie, they speak different than the people they seceded from... just like we speak different than the British... makes you think, huh?

 It's interesting to try and figure out what M. Night Shyamalan is trying to say about our system and the people who are a part of it.

As some of my friends disliked the movie with passion, I loved it. I thought it was incredibly smart and intensely moving. The protagonist is a blind young girl that will go to unimaginable extents to rescue the love of her life.

I found the parallels in this film quite potent. The power of instilling fear in society, the power of denial, the power of conviction and ultimately the power of love were all depicted with sheer finesse. Aside from some really bad acting (what's wrong Sigourney Weaver?), the movie was impeccably beautiful.

Go see it with an open mind and you will love it. Go see it expecting a horror film and you will hate it. It's your call.",1091318400,3,859,4.45859872611465
2167937,4,B00064LJVO,"When i walked out of the theater after this film was over, EVERYONE was yelling about how much it sucked. I myself was even a little bit bewildered and angry at certain aspects of it. But all those people will stop and think about it later like another reviewer has written. The idea of the movie has grown on me and what happened at the end is like (!!???!!!).

 I think that a major reason people will not like this movie is because M. Night made it after he made Signs. When i first came out of the theater, i thought M. Night made somewhat of a mistake. But the more i think about it, the more i respect him. Instead of making a scary creature movie that would top signs (this is what the previews misled audiences into beleiving it was) M. Night went for a different approach and made a different kind of movie. This time around, it doesn't have such a break-neck speed climax. THis time around, the ending twist doesn't explode in your face in the last five minutes of the movie like his previous films. Instead, this time, we are given little peices of it until it finally seeps in. This really does turn into a completely different movie at the end and really IS a big twist. There are sort of two phases to this twist, so don't get mad right away. WHen it first started to unfold, i was sure i saw that coming, but then it just sort of builds into a freaking twilight zone ending.

 My only complaint is the actors. William Hurt just sucked in this movie, and so did Sigourney Weaver. They were spending so much time trying mimick the language and the manner of that time period that they forgot to add emotion to it and make it real. ANother complaint is that they spent too much time building for the end instead of just letting it progress. There wasn't enough of these ""creatures"" to be experienced, and i felt like the only real creepy sequences with them was the one where the town was being quarantined, and the one where the blind girl has an encounter in the forest. I know it's not a horror movie at it's chore, but it just gives off this feel like M. Night didn't put any more creepy scenes into it because the movie was running short on time.

 P.S. M. Night knew what he was going for with this one: there's one seen that widened my eyes and had everyone in the theater gasping, not in surprise or fright, but in just sheer shock and horror. He takes Hitchcockian ideas to all new extremes.",1091318400,3,2412,4.3017621145374445
2167938,4,B00064LJVO,"This is less a movie review and more a defense of it (contains spoilers!). I think people need to get over the fact the movie was advertised as a thriller/horror and think it didn't deliver... was it a horror movie? NO... you found that out... was it really meant to be? NO... Shyamalan's intentions are clear, create an atmosphere to disorient and mislead people until the point he shows you what is really going on. That may not be scary but it is suspenseful and entertaining... Signs and The Sixth Sense weren't really horror movies either... They were also telling dramatic stories with a twist ending.

 Think for a moment. How else could the movie be advertised? M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"". A disturbing tale of modern day people tired of the modern day world... watch as they deceive their offspring into believing they are forever trapped into a solitude of 19th century life trapped in by unspeakable monsters... now... wouldn't that ruin the plot twist... and all the excitement!? It is advertised to disguise this fact because it takes you on a ride with a climatic twist for an ending. It is shallow and shamefully aesthetic to think this movie sucks because what... there aren't really monsters? This movie has something more to convey? I think that mentality conveys the low level of today's movie goer's sense of entertainment... THIS MOVIE PLAYS TO YOUR THOUGHTS, BELIEFS, AND EMOTIONS... a deeper and more satisfying experience.

This movie is more about the motivation of the characters and how it applies to their situation rather than a super twisty ending.  And the performances were well done.  It's worth a matinee ticket.",1091318400,4,536,4.474226804123711
2167940,4,B00064LJVO,"M. Night Shamalyan is one of my favourite directors of all time. Seriously, I love almost all this stuff. Of course the Sixth Sense was great (bless that little boy!), and I thought the tragically underrated ""Unbreakable"" was actually even better than ""Sixth Sense"". ""Signs"" is a great thriller until the somewhat lame and anticlimactic ending.

 That said, I was highly psyched to go see ""the Village"", and like everyone else I was mislead by the commercials that this was gonna be an edge-of-your-seat horror movie. I even read reviews that said ""don't watch this movie as a horror movie, or you'll be disappointed"". I just couldn't shake the notion in my head that this was a horror movie, and lo and behold, I was greatly disappointed and felt let down by the ending. If you felt completely SOLD OUT by the ending, I feel for ya buddy! I was there too!

 If you had asked me to write this Amazon review the moment I walked out of the theatre, I would have given it a 2, maybe 3 tops. The problem with ""the Village"" is that of course (as you've no doubt heard by now) it's not a horror movie! But I think the even bigger problem is that director Shamalyan gives us, the audience, WAY too much credit. Puh-leez, we are NOT that smart! I was of course intelliegent enough to piece together the first 'twist' from all the (disappointed) reviews I read. The second twist came as quite a surprise, and was accompanied by a 'WTF!!??' However, angered viewer, don't pass judgement right there in the theatre. Go home, eat dinner, and let the second, final twist marinate in your brain for awhile. And a third, crucial key point of the movie went completely over my head until hours after seeing the movie. Shamalyan doesn't explain it and just expects you to 'figure it out' on your own. Again, givin' us too much credit here, M. Night! I can't tell you what the key point is of course, but let me just say this: Isn't it absurd they'd send out a defenceless blind girl out into the woods alone? (Her escorts were ordered not to go onto the road, even if they didn't chicken out). Yes...it is absurd...ergo there must be a reason. Think about it. The key word is 'think'.

 If I had to pick one phrase to describe ""the Village"", it would have to be: ""Makes you think"". The movie makes you think harder than any film has the right to. This movie will ultimately fail in the box office (although technically it's #1 this week, but you just wait!) I don't think America, or any country for that matter, is ready for this movie. This isn't entertainment, it's a senior thesis project on sociology.

 My critique of the technical aspects of the movie: The cinematography is gorgeous; in fact I may go see the movie again just to dunk my head into the imagery and 'feel' of the movie again. Or I may go see it again to see Bryce Dallas Howard (Ivy)'s cute, freckled face again, ha ha. Either is good with me. The few scenes that were scary were done with chilling effectiveness.

 The acting is very uneven. This movie contains some of the best and worst acting I've ever seen in a major motion picture. Bravo to Shamalyan for choosing to make a pretty, naive blind girl (as one of the professional reviewers put it: ""innocent without looking virginal"") as the real hero and main character of the movie, instead of hollywood pretty-boy who will triumph through the physical prowess that only a man can possess (relax, I'm being sarcastic). I always enjoy movies with a ""real"", believeable female protagonist. Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) represents a kind of real girl power, as opposed to cheesy, pandering absurdities a la ""Charlie's Angles"". Howard, apart from being utterly adorable and very pretty (I have a weakness for redheads with freckles), is mesmerising and enthralling to watch on screen as she plays her character with genuine emotion and subtle perfection. Like a master pianist performing her craft, Dallas Howard doesn't hit a single false note, and does so with no pretention. This is a textbook example of how to not overdo a performance. Just watch her. Joaquin Phoenix is decent, also going for the subtle, quiet approach. Unfortunatley we don't get to see much of him, and his character remains under-developed. But if that's the price we have to pay to see more of Howard, then away with Phoenix! That said, every other performance was quite dismal. Conversations were stunted and forced, and everything felt very artificial. I truly expected better from veteran actor William Hurt. Shame on you!

 Aside from being a graduate-level sociology thesis, at the heart of this movie is also a touching love story about the lengths that said adorable blind girl will go for l'amor. Really, after seeing this movie, you will think to yourself, ""wow, now THAT'S love. Now where can I find a girl like that?"" So, let's recap: sociology project, love story. Nothing about horror or thriller. Got it? Good. I know you'll still go see the movie expecting it to scare you. (God knows I did. Doesn't matter how many reviews you read telling you it's not). The commercials are powerful, and the notions are set deep. And certain parts of the movie WILL give you a jump, for the time being at least. All I can say is, give this movie a chance. After seeing it you WILL hate it, but if you let it sit and marinate for awhile, maybe you'll start to like it more and more. And that's really not bad for a movie, since I know many movies that become more and more awlful the longer you think about them (like the Star Wars prequels).

 One last note: prior to seeing ""the Village"" I was well-aware of M. Night Shamalyan's propensity to copy Hitchcock and give himself a cameo in every movie. Since this movie is set in 1890's rural America, where no Indians (from India) were, I thought that there would be no way Shamalyan could continue his tradition. Well, you'll be surprised. Just see. And think about it.",1091318400,5,5900,4.6066666666666665
2167941,1,B00064LJVO,"Six months ago when the trailers were released for suspense-master Shylaman's new film, fans and non-fans alike were looking forward to being scared senseless by the creatures that live in the woods beyond the borders of the happy little Pennsylvania village that is the setting of ""The Village"".

 Unfortunately, the acting is the most frightning thing about this dull, uneventful spin on Little House on the Prarie. Oscar winner Adrien Brody fares the worst as village idiot Noah Percy, who stumbles about mumbling to himself much of the time. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a deadpan performance as Lucius Hunt, the young man intrigued by the cloak-wearing, overgrown porqupine-looking creatures that lurk in the woods. Seasoned veterans Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt are completely wasted in their roles as as elders of the small town. Though the performances are terrible; actors are only as good as the dialogue they speak, which is laughable.

 Shylaman, credited as writer, poducer, and director; clearly bit off more than he could chew with this one. The quality of his films has clearly gone downhill since his ""Sixth Sense"" hayday. Perhaps this supposed master of suspense will deliver a coherent story next time, but until then, don't make the mistake of paying this Village a visit.",1091318400,6,1293,5.172248803827751

I'm not letting anyone know this review has spoilers as to help the future viewers to watch something else. I was warned by a friend at work to stay away, but I blew it off. Heed his warning, stay away!!!! This movie just made me sick, short and to the point. When I found out the old folks were the ""creatures"",and who couldn't tell, I was ok. When nutjob chases blind girl through the woods, I was getting queasy. When the truth is revealed about the village and what happens afterwards, I just got sick. The fact that those whackjob quacks would keep all those people there under false pretenses,knowing full well theres a real world out there and choosing to keep them in the puritan era is apalling. Yeah, lets promote that!! I won't give away the whole premise of the movie(they are a cult in the middle of a preserve, using monsters to keep the locals scared to leave town...oops), but this is just a bad flick.

I thought it was a superb film, though I'll admit that the Colonial dialogue was slightly flawed (but remember--spoiler--the people weren't really from that era...).  Anyway, the twist was shocking, though everyone knew one was coming thanks to Shayamalan's previous films.  I thought the best performance in the film was by Bryce Dallas Howard, Ron Howard's daughter, who was absolutely phenomenal in her breakthrough role as Ivy.  She deserves an Oscar for her intense portrayal of a blind girl who risks everything for the one she loves.  I will definitely see this movie again in theaters, and then buy the DVD.

This movie is a real waste of time and money, although I imagine no M. Night Shyamalan fan will believe negative reviews until they see the movie themselves. This seems like the type of plot that a pot-smoking friend would come up with late at night, not the work of the genius-creator of ""The Sixth Sense."" My guess is that M.

Most of the comments I was hearing was how confused people were by the end.  I can see how that would be for some people because the commercials for the movie were rather misleading to what the movie was really about.

I found it was alot like 'The Sixth Sense', in that nothing is as it seems.  Joaquin Phoenix was great as always.  Bryce Dallas Howard was fantastic in her film debut.  Her father should be proud.  Adrian Brody, playing the village idiot, was a laugh one minute and a shock the next.

I want to see the movie again, after knowing the twist, to see if I can catch any hints to the twist.

I love that M. Night is keeping his movies local.  He's the pride of Philly.  I love to see where he pops up in his movies.

You need to pay attention carefully to the movie, if you do then it shouldn't be too confusing to watch and you might just enjoy it like I did.

The only other good thing that I can say is, The Village was good enough to keep you talking about it long after it's over.",1091318400,4,1077,4.0

I loved William Hurt and Bryce Howard.  But I especially loved Joaquin Phoenix's character.  He was so awkward, yet so noble and brave.  He should play more roles like Lucius Hunt.  I recommend it very much to everyone.  I think when people went in the theater to see it they were expecting too much.  Just go in there with an open mind and you'll love it.

Are synomonous with the Career of Mr. Shymalan. The advertised thriller was a boring, stupid, waste of my time and money.

 Something has happened, though. Animals, dying. Skinned. Marks on the doors, in red--the forbidden color. Something is happening in the forest...but the biggest dangers, and the most forboding secrets, lie within the village itself...

 M. Night Shyamalan has written and directed another intimidating thriller. Though it lacks a certain quality present in ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs,"" it is still rivetting and engrossing (note the five-star rating). Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard, William Hurt, Siguorney Weaver, Bredan Gleeson, and Adrien Brody give the performances of their careers...not one role is wasted or ill-acted. Aside from the suspense, of course, it is the acting that carries this film.

 This is a top-notch thriller by modern-master M. Night Shyamalan. With superb acting and an intense delivery, how could you not want to see this film?

Instead it is much like Signs, with far more suspense and clever twists and turns, heartbreaking storylines and unbelievable performances. It is a mix of suspense, mystery, romance, and adventure, in a mild way.  Will you jump?  Maybe here and there.  Will you scream?  Not outloud, but maybe inside of you! I did hear some major gasping during a few scenes!  Will it haunt you?  Oh, yes!  Will you feel sick to your stomach when you leave the film?  No.  Will the music stick in your mind, will you ponder the political statements so timely made, and will you want to rent or buy it in the future, to rewatch, refigure, look for hints to the ending, etc.?  Yes, definitely!  Don't go hoping for a slasher, blood and guts movie, or you will be disappointed.  And don't look for horror, or a scream-fest.

2167954,3,B00064LJVO,"I went to the theater to see this movie a bit conflicted. On one hand, I was excited because I am such a fan of most of M. Night Shyamalan's other work (""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"", most notably). However, the premise seemed a bit overdone--after all, there have been other stories written about small villages being haunted by some sort of creature from surrounding woods.

 What I saw when I got to the theater was exceptionally disappointing, though. For one thing, the characters were so poorly developed that: 1, I had a whole lot of trouble keeping track of who everyone was and how they all related to each other; and 2, I felt very little emotion towards any of the townspeople, even during their most tense situations.

 Secondly, and most importantly, I think, was the dreadfully poor storyline. The ""twist"" of an ending was not only cliche but extremely predictable. When it comes down to it, even if I were to spoil the ending and explain the entire movie (as I've done before with others), it would seem so patently absurd that you would probably not believe me.

 The only good point I can think of is the fact that there were some tense moments that made me jump. Other than that, I see no redeeming qualities.

 Overall, this was a very poorly done work. Fans of the director will probably not be kept from seeing it (like I wasn't) but I would recommend waiting to see it until it came out on video.",1091318400,3,1418,4.51171875
2167955,4,B00064LJVO,"THIS ISN'T SCARY AT ALL!!! Nor was it meant to be. This is more of an suspence/drama. It has quite alot of twists and turns and surprises instore for it's audience. Oh and keep an eye out for Night's cameo. This will dissappoint many because, well it's just not how they wanted it to be. THIS IS NOT A HORROR FILM PEOPLE! IT'S NOT SCARY!!! So don't go in expecting such. The Village is a thrilling tale of an isolated village confronting the astonishing truth that lies just outside its borders. At first glance, this village seems picture perfect, but this close-knit community lives with the frightening knowledge that creatures reside in the surrounding woods. The evil and foreboding force is so unnerving that none dare venture beyond the borders of the village and into the woods. But when curious, headstrong Lucius Hunt plans to step beyond the boundaries of the town and into the unknown, his bold move threatens to forever change the future of the village. I wish I could tell you the 2 amazing twists in this film, and it's sturring conclusion but I can't ruin it for you guys!. Now if you're going in there expecting this to be another sixth sense, which so many people want him to do another film just like that, you will be dissappointed. I find everyone wants him to make another sixth sense, but you know that would be boring. If you're expecting this to be some kind of heart pounding thriller that'll scre the pants off you, then you will find yourself bored beyond belief because not at one point does this movie become scary.

Maybe, we ""Night"" fans just expect to be scared out of our seat and we read into the trailers more than was there.

2167958,3,B00064LJVO,"July hasn't been a good month for the movies.

 After DC Comic fans wouldn't go see Halle Berry ham it up in a stupid S & M outfit and thus, witnessing the apocalyptic catastrophe, ""Catwoman"" rightfully crash and burn at the box office (a pathetic 3rd Place opening with $17 Mil, finishing behind the tepid ""I, Robot"", a film that opened the week before it), ""The Village"" is a damn good breath of fresh air.

 I did something before seeing this movie that I don't normally do: I read just about every critic's review of the film. I hate doing that for several reasons. For one, I always have their thoughts in my head and always find the faults they point out are magnified ten times larger than normal, two, I don't like spending time talking about other critics and three, I don't want to go in with any sort of expectations other than what I saw in the trailers and T.V. spots. I remedy all of this by just reading little quips or by-lines and then wait until I've seen the movie.

 If you haven't read the reviews of this film, most have been highly critical of director M. Night Shyamalan who, after doing two weak movies, reloaded and turned out the fantastic ghost story, ""The Sixth Sense"". Somehow, in all his success, Night set himself up to fail. That film was so good and the twist at the end so mind-blowing, that he couldn't possibly live up to future releases. ""Unbreakable"" was a wonderful film giving us a glimpse of the mythical ""hero's journey"" and ""Signs"", while not very good, was effective in at least building tension before it finally petered out with no payoff.

 So now, after you've read all of the above (I told you I hate getting into what critics think), let's turn to ""The Village"" (opening this weekend).

 ""We are thankful for the time we have been given,"" says Edward Walker (William Hurt) in monotone, addressing his people, who are gathered for lunch/dinner at a few long wooden tables. He ends there, seemingly trailing away from what he wanted to say. Already, there is a tense energy in the air. Something isn't right. Before this, one of the townspeople buried their child. Victim, apparently, of a gang of creatures that live in the woods surrounding the isolated and puritanical village-town of Covington, Pennsylvania. Run by a group of ""elders"" headed mostly by Walker and Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver), they inform their people that they do not stray into the woods and the creatures do not go into Covington. Their loud and eerie howls fill the air, causing the townspeople's nerves to be on edge. Only the seemingly-crazed Noah Percy (Adrien Brody in a thankless role) seems to find humor and laughs outloud at the noises coming from the forest beyond...

 In response to the town's recent death, Alice's fearless son, Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) announces to the elders that he wants to go into the woods and obtain medicine from a neighboring town. He does so, against their wishes, but is witnessed by one of the creatures to be in their territory. Because of this, all hell breaks loose. The creatures come into town, leaving red marks on every door of every building. Animals are found skinned with twisted necks.

 Through all this, Alice addresses the nervous townsfolk, telling them, ""we must remain vigilant""...familiar words, especially in light of current world events.

 If this isn't enough, Edward's blind daughter, Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) has fallen for Lucius because he shares the same traits she carries. He is brave and he knows how to handle himself. He's also very morose and serious and doesn't speak much. This makes him a poor match for Edward's other daughter, Kitty, who was shot down by Lucius after she (embarrassingly) confessed her love for him. It isn't until another tragedy befalls the town that Ivy takes it upon herself to try and learn the mysteries of the woods by continuing Lucius's quest. In doing so, however, she may unlock something a lot darker and more sinister.

 Giving anything else away would be grounds for my arrest, trial, and execution.

 This movie is brilliant. It's Shyamalan's finest film since ""The Sixth Sense"" and exactly what ""Signs"" should have been: smartly written, incredibly clever, beautifully shot, and actually creepy. There is no gore in this film (save for one scene with Brody, but it's minor) and there shouldn't be any gore. Everyone who was expecting a slasher-film came to the wrong movie...looking at Shyamalan's history, you would think that moviegoers would learn that, but no, they continue to complain.

 The only problem I had with the movie was the cardboard acting. Everyone seems to be on auto-pilot as they walk through their lines as if they're going through a cold-reading in rehearsals. The only time this works is with Hurt, who expresses so much through his eyes and facial expressions, Phoenix, who seems like he has a chip on his shoulder and Weaver, who seems to be both tired and worried. The actress who steals the show is Bryce Dallas Howard. As Ivy, she is very much human and has fears and worries like the rest of her neighbors. However, she is also driven and keeps cool mainly because she has the luxury of not having her eyesight.

 Like all of Night's other films, this one is also leisurely-paced but there's always that underlying tension that gives the film its wings and because of that, it's not boring. Like Rod Serling before him, Shyamalan retains his skill of stringing you along and then trapping you when you least expect it. Again, I won't spoil the ending, but once it's revealed, you may realize that you are actually a PART of the town of Covington and that thought will haunt you long after you leave the theater.

2167959,5,B00064LJVO,"This movie is wonderful. It is magical and poetic and suspenseful all at the same time. M. Night is a visual story teller, and his gift is readily apparent in this film. He has a nack for finding the right camera angles and shots that pack as much punch as the characters themselves.

 Do not go see this movie expecting a rehash of ""Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs"". This movie is unlike those two in almost every way. This film is more of a subtle romance film that delves into human character and the things we will do to protect those most dear to us.

 Lucious (Phoenix) and Ivy (Howard) are the stars of this movie. The plot revolves around them and the characters dance on strings pulled by M. Night in order to tell their story with the most impact. Phoenix gives a stellar performance as Lucious, a quiet young man who loves with an intensity that is almost painful. Howard plays the part of a blind girl who can ""see"" more that most people realize. She is a strong woman posessed of a firm will and iron hard determination. If Ms. Howard does not recieve an Oscar nod for this performance- there truly is no justice in this world. Brody (The pianist) is the mentally challenged young man in the village, and he too gives one heck of a performance. The actors have done a superb job, adding another layer to this wonderful movie.

 Regardless of the situation, the characters, the setting and the plot twists, this film makes you believe. For two hours you are immersed in a world that seems real. M. Night has a way of making us care for the characters, making us feel the emotional tension and sorrow and apprehension at the proper times in the movie. I suppose that is the mark of a master filmaker. And who would pass up the chance to be entertained by a master of the craft? This movie is truly one of the best that I have seen in years, literally. A masterpiece of scenery, visual impact, character study, and emotional manipulation. Truly a treat for any film lover and the perfect way to spend a summer evening. A must see, must buy on DVD film. Five stars all the way!!! Go. See. This. Movie.",1091318400,10,2101,4.402061855670103
2167960,5,B00064LJVO,"Like many others that went to see this movie based on trailers and previews, I was expecting unrelenting horror, a thrill-a-minute edge-of-your-seat shock-fest, but *not* a ""slasher"" type movie. Well, it wasn't a ""slasher"" type movie, but neither was it unrelenting horror. Even the suspense was somewhat low-key. What M. Night *did* deliver was a movie so rich in character that I can't wait to see it again!

 We have an unconventional hero (does M. Night do any other kind?), a facinatingly unique heroine more than worthy of him, humor, suspense, romance, and yes there *is* some terrifying ""jump out of your seat"" moments. The acting was superb, the interaction between characters rich and fulfilling, and the presentation awe-inspiring.

 I wish there had been more scary moments, since that is what I went to see, but I have no complaints about the final product other than that. This movie deserves to be rated on it's own merits, not whether it was marketed correctly. The M. Night ""signature twists"" were quite facinating, because there was more than one. Three, in fact, each more unexpected (at least, to me) than the last.

 Forget the hype, forget the trailers, forget the promo spots. Go into this movie expecting nothing more, nor less, than a truly wonderful film with stellar acting and directing. I truly enjoyed this movie and cannot wait to see it again, and then buy the DVD.",1091232000,4,1397,4.898305084745763
2167961,3,B00064LJVO,"I went into this movie thinking anticipating horror. The movie is marketed as a horrow. The website, commercials and posters all point to a horror movie. However, this is clearly where the advertising team of this movie made their mistake.

 If this movie was not advertised as a horror, would there be as many negative ratings? I would believe not. However, I suppose if the movie was advertised as a period romance/suspense, it would not draw the crowds in the first week.

 The Village is pure period suspense and romance. It makes you think and it has M. Night Shyamalan's signiture twist ending. I loved the feel of the movie and the look. The costumes were excellent. The actors were superb, especially Bryce Dallas Howard, Adrien Brody and Joaquin Pheonix. This is what made the movie excellent-the actors. They breathed life into the characters; characters with slightly wooden dialogue, but they made it work. The story may not have been strong, but the actors made it believable.

 This movie does make you think. However, it does end rather abruptly. My question at the end of the film was ""what happens next?"" Although not to the quality of The Sixth Sense, this movie is quite different. It has it's brillant moments and shaky moments. Watch it, but don't go in expecting horror because it won't deliver. Mr. Shyamalan himself said he considered Wuthering Heights to be a kind of inspiration for this film...think about that before you watch it.",1091232000,2,1458,4.858870967741935
2167962,2,B00064LJVO,"I read the occasional reverent reviews towards this mess and am just dumbfounded. People--this film is the work of an absolutely rank amateur. One reviewer called it a tale of how fear manipulates, deceives, and tricks us all--he's close, but it's really about how M. Night Shyamalan manipulates, deceives, and tricks us all. Every scare is a complete cheat, and anyone with an ounce of perception will quickly see that several plot elements are introduced out of context (out of NOWHERE!), with no other function except to keep us guessing what the hell is going on. It is one implausible red herring after another, with outrageously illiterate, forced dialogue and not one developed character in the bunch. There are people all over the place in this film, and we couldn't care less about any of them--everytime a character is forced to show some emotion (melodramatically), it's like watching a generic casting audition.

 Shyamalan has made a career out of the big plot twist, and he's clearly getting desperate for ideas. He lets the cat out of the bag this time with a good half hour left to go, and we are tortured for the remainder of the film watching all the innumerable dolts in the ensemble cast (many of whom are esteemed actors, who seem mortified with embarrassment) go through one expository exercise after another to complete the arc of the plot. Check out Celia Weston burst into hysterical tears when she learns that her son is dead, then promptly shut up and drop out of character while William Hurt delivers another homily out of Swiss Family Robinson.

 Oh, we also get to watch this ditzy twit run a veritable obstacle course through a brightly lit, densely overgrown forest, revealing herself to be one of the most remarkably dexterous and agile blind people on Earth. She accidentally falls into a ravine, and despite the fact that she is wearing a petticoat, manages to hang on by one arm while throwing her burlap sack and cane to safety. She sprints at one point for several hundred yards, and manages never to trip over all sorts of roots, stones, underbrush, and holes, and never once runs into a tree. Apparently she has a very keen sense of smell or something. And Shyamalan evidently realized that he'd deflated all the tension after revealing the big secret, so he momentarily backtracks for one last scare in the form of a coda so dubious and poorly structured that it must have been tacked onto the shooting script on a yellow sticky.

 M. Night Shyamalan is shrewd. He knows the formula. He likes to refer to his films as personal visions, as if this narcissistic spoiled brat from an affluent immigrant family had the slightest concept of the experience of all the imperiled down-home working class folk in his pictures. What he knows is how to appeal to the masses, with maudlin morality tales, good ol' Christian family values, and bloodless pseudohorror films that might give Ned Flanders a little jolt, but to the rest of us have absolutely no visceral weight. He's a Pennsylvania native, and is well known to be provincial about it; he's eschewed moving to New York or LA in favor of building a film production company on the Main Line, one of the most white bread locales on the planet. This may explain the banality of his choices. I thought we had established that the Amish were unworthy of dramatic material with ""Witness"". He apparently thought so too, and livened things up a bit with faux wisteria and what appear to be Trapp candles for a wedding scene. Apparently there's a former employee of MJ Designs amongst the elders.

 I did enjoy the possibly unintentional homage to Roeg's ""Don't Look Now"", in the form of the mysterious creature running around in a red cape. I'm rather pissed that everytime I see that masterpiece in the future I'm going to be reminded of this piece of celluloid dreck, which should be cut up into guitar picks.

 Watch the extras on the DVD for ""The Sixth Sense"" sometime--there's an excerpt from a Super 8 film that Shyamalan shot when he was 12 or something. His technique and level of sophistication haven't changed--he just has more expensive equipment now. And Roger Deakins on board as DP to make his adolescent ideas look like a Miramax picture. I'm sure he'll continue to make millions--there's the real horror.

2167963,5,B00064LJVO,"It's rare to see an intellectual thriller as good as the four which Shyamalan has produced; not since the days of old have we been treated to four finer films that delve into the very essence of what it means to human. And with 'The Village', Shyamalan delivers what is certainly not his best film, but is still an amazingly captivating experience in the dramatic form of Alfred Hitchcock with a Rod Serling morality play thrown into the mix. 'The Village' is as well crafted as it is intense; as well-acted as it is real to humanity; as well photographed as it is surreal.

 Composer James Newton Howard's score even plays a heavily dramatic role --in a way, its own character-- in this film and the solo violin playing of Hilary Hahn is part --almost its own character, really-- of what adds the depth, character, and weight to this picture. Roger Deakins' cinematography accentuates the beautiful and the horrific all with one fell stroke of the camera lens, and Shyamalan's writing and directing are as solid and as steadfast and as unwavering as ever.

 The twist isn't what makes this film though, as much as critics would have the public belive; it's a means to an end, really. . . no more, no less. The true nature of this film lies what is beyond the twist. . . what lies within the realm of the ""twist""ed nature of the human mind and society as a whole and is a powerful moral tale of perfection begetting imperfection. Of supposed purity begetting sinfulness. The critics who miss out on this aspect of the film are the ones who seem to hate it the most.

 Its sad to think that there are people out there who will watch this movie and never realize its true intent. . . its true power and purpose. Its even more sad to think that people will walk out of this film because they were expecting a slasher/scare-you-to-death type of film. As I said, it is a heavily dramatic film. . . more suspenseful and intense than downright scary or terrifying. It is a story filled with love. . . doubt. . . courage. . . anger. . . but, above all, fear and what it means. It is a tale of how fear manipulates, deceives, and tricks us all.

 Those who understand this film will whole-heartedly enjoy it; those who are endlessly lost by its well-developed characters, purposefully drawn-out dialogues, and bewitching storyline (the reality of what others have labeled as ""slow"" and ""boring"") will --sadly enough-- hate it, and it really is their true loss. Slasher films are forgotten because of their predictability. . . their liking of showing too much with too much brute visual force. Shyamalan's films require brain power. . . require the audience to fill in the blank spaces. . . to walk in the corners of their mind they hate to venture into.

 Much of the criticism over this film (and Unbreakable) reminds me of the reviews Hitchcock got over many of his pictures. . . critics panned such well-revered classics as Psycho and Vertigo as nonsense. . . ridiculous. . . too confusing; yet now, critics praise both films to the heavens now that the truths of both films have been revealed and are widely understood for their impact and force. I deeply feel this is the way Shyamalan's films will be treated in the coming years as people begin to understand the inner workings of the films and realize what masterpieces such films as this truly are.

 So, if you were put off by the mind-trips of Shyamalan's previous three ventures, you'd best skip this one and see something more along the lines of ""Harold & Kumar"" or ""King Arthur"". Those movies will be forgotten in time and I'll be quite happy when I'm older to see Shyamalan's films still watched and admired the world over for their originality, boldness, and forthright gestures about what it means to be human. . . about accepting destiny. . . about re-finding faith. . . and about the dangers that fear can wreak on us.

 Highly, highly recommended for those with open minds and who have plenty of time to mull over the material presented and discuss its complexities and puzzles.",1091232000,4,4038,4.598052851182198

2167965,2,B00064LJVO,"This movie could have been cut down to about a 30 minute short, but instead Shyamalan decided to double space his way towards feature length in what was a very disappointing film.  Firstly, I thought the movie was supposed to be a horror film, but there are really just a few scenes where suspense builds and quickly disperses.

An interesting thing about this movie, there is a twist at the end that no one is going to see coming...unless you have some common sense and a bit of an imagination.  Basically the end is predictable if you are able to remain awake for the duration.  Also, watch for Shyamalan's forced little cameo.

The only redeemable quality about this movie was the fact that it was technically sound.  All the cinematography and audio and good stuff like that was decent, overall the production quality was high, I just felt that the movie itself was not entertaining.",1091232000,3,887,4.690322580645161
2167966,3,B00064LJVO,"Fans who have stayed loyal through M. Night Shyamalan's psychological blockbusters like ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"" walked into theaters July 30 expecting Shyamalan's newest creation, ""The Village,"" to not only frighten movie-goers back into the 19th century, but also give them mind-blowing plot twists and an ending Nostradamus couldn't predict.

  In the end, it was these rigid expectations that made ""The Village"" into Shyamalan's first flop since the success of ""The Sixth Sense"" in 1999.

 Before the opening credits even rolled, the suspicions began to fly. Accusatory whispers tried to debunk the mystery of whatever Shyamalan was about to pull. Like an audience closely watching a magician's act for any strings or trap doors, Shyamalan's fans picked apart every awkward sentence (""Why did they say that-that's weird phrasing!"") and every suspicious action (""Why did he go into the woods and not get harmed?"") until they narrowed the ""super-secret"" twist into a few possibilities.

  No doubt, Shyamalan predicted his audience would pick apart his work and attempted to hide ""the twist"" until the last minute with minimal clues leading up to the great revealing. The only problem: It turned out just like every other movie with a convenient twist to further the plot, not a twist  that makes you go ""aha!""

  In films like ""The Sixth Sense,"" part of the joy of finding out the ending was that it was so obvious all along, yet few noticed it-causing anyone watching the movie for the second time to hit themselves repeatedly in the forehead and utter ""Oh my gosh! I should have known"" approximately 124 times.

""The Village"" will not do this for anyone-even those who didn't guess the ending within the first 25 minutes. Conversations to ""throw off"" the fans don't resolve themselves, motives aren't ever explained and several actions (namely those involving ""the creatures who live in the woods"" are shrugged off like accidents by the few who know the truth).

  The blind Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) repeatedly tells Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) that she can see his ""color,"" but won't tell him what it is. Although this is a significant part of their interactions, she never does say what color he is and the subject is never touched on again.

  Speaking of color, Shyamalan's use of color of symbolism that enriched and furthered the plots in ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"" become tiresome and sloppy in ""The Village."" Red, as usual, is the ""bad color."" Yellow, represented by the druid-like cloaks worn by the villagers and the flags hung on posts marking the edge of the woods, is the ""safe color."" As it was in ""Signs"" Shyamalan uses water as part of the solution as Ivy follows the stream to get through the woods.

  One thing that Shyamalan has consistently done right throughout his career and that still holds true with ""The Village"" is pulling together an ensemble of A-listers actors (and upcoming stars) to carry his films to success.

First of all, Howard (Yes, she is the daughter of actor/director Ron Howard) amply shows off all the acting blood she has flowing through her veins by playing a difficult character-a blind woman from the 19th century-like a pro even though this is her first role in a mainstream picture.

  Joaquin Phoenix gives an outstanding performance in his second Shyamalan film. Despite playing a character (in both ""Signs"" and ""The Village"") with slightly less personality than a houseplant, Phoenix adds just enough mystery to compensate for the lack of personality.

  Oh, and let us not forget the Adrian Brody (yes, he is important enough to have ""the"" places before his name) who plays Noah Percy, the mentally disabled son of one of the village elders. Much like a big-nosed Johnny Depp, Brody can take on difficult roles (especially unconventional ones) and bring them to life with an added touch of insanity. Plus, he's really hot (what can I say).

  Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt, who long ago proved their versatility and skill, played minor roles and allowed the next generation of actors to carry the story. Perhaps this, although not intentional, was Shyamalan's best symbolism throughout the entire movie.

  Because I guessed one of the plot twists before the movie started and another one within the first half hour, I couldn't fully enjoy the movie. I expected more from the genius who put together ""The Sixth Sense"" like a puzzle, each sentence carefully planned that, in the end, would make complete sense. Instead, ""The Village"" offered a mediocre plot that bored more than terrified. A victim of his own success, Shyamalan now has become ""The Village"" idiot.

If you do go see this movie and happened to read this, maybe you can save this movie by answering some questions that I had after the movie(I'm going to phrase them carefully as to not give away much of the plot or any of the secret twists to anyone who has not seen the movie).

1. Recall the skinned animals found early in the story. Toward the end, there is a secret twist explained and one of the elders says something explaining the skinned animals. Does he sound a bit too nonchalant and unconcerned for what they are dealing with? Like ""oh yeah, I should probably do something about that,"" but nothing is solved.

2. The red markings on the door (most have seen this in the trailer) and then another eerie incident leave the people saying ""They want us to leave."" After you see the ending, uhm, that doesn't make sense. Neither do the incidents. Other than the conversation mentioned in question one, this is not solved either and no reasoning is given.

3. Ivy keeps taunting Lucius that she sees a color around him and her father but she won't tell Lucius what that color is! She never does! Did I miss something or did they waste all that time for something that didn't even matter? That doesn't seem like Shyamalan's style!

4. Noah is ""special"" as one will realize AFTER the ""secret boxes"" held by the village elders are opened and their contents revealed. Let's just say Noah has kept a secret too but he seems too stupid to not let it slip and too smart to not ""remember"" the entire incident. Plus, he doesn't seem much older than Lucius and Ivy, but they were babies when the incident happened and Noah was a grown man.

5. There is a love plot between Lucius' mother and Ivy's father. Isn't that weird? Because Lucius and Ivy obviously have a love thing going so they'll be marrying their stepbrother/stepsister if their parents hooked up. And the adults love thing is completely downplayed and doesn't have a point. Why was it in there?",1091232000,,6614,4.843555555555556
2167967,2,B00064LJVO,"Like The Sixth Sense, The Village culminates in the revelation of a secret, which as far as I'm concerned, was not so secret. I won't spoil it, but I will say that I saw it coming from the beginning, mainly because I had read a book called Running Out of Time, by Margaret Haddix, which has the exact same premise (not plot exactly, although there are plot points in common, but the premise without qualification) as The Village. I saw it coming, but then so did my husband, who has not read Running Out of Time. All the same, if Margaret Haddix sues M. Night Shyamalan, I hope she wins.

 That said, this is a pretty film. The story is not pretty, but the film itself is; the cinematography is studied and careful, and has a dream-like quality that reminded me of Picnic at Hanging Rock.

 William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver, the ""names"" in this film are unremarkable; however, the two sisters, daughters of Hurt's character are exceptional, and the main reason I didn't regret the money spent on admission. Die-Hard fans of Hurt and Weaver will be disappointed, though, because not only are they unremarkable, they don't have much screen time. Personally, I'm not a fan of Hurt, but I do like Weaver quite a lot, and felt let down by her wooden performance.

 People who enjoyed Signs, or The Sixth Sense will probably like this film, if not love it, and have probably already decided to see it. That's fine. For the fence-sitters, who don't know whether to see it or not: don't bother.",1091232000,3,1487,4.571428571428571

It could have succeeded as a horror film, but then decides it wants to be something else; it never fully becomes that 'something else,' though. If M. Night Shyamalan establishes himself as a real legend, I think this will be remembered as one of his minor achievements.",1091232000,,585,4.745098039215686

 It starts out REALLY slow. Then, it really starts to pick up and get ""creepy."" then, it becomes so lame again, and becomes good, and then somthing happens that killed the whole movie.

 let me say that this movie is more funny than scary. At a serious part where the creatures inside the woods were attacking, me and my friends and a ton of people in the theatures were laughing so hard, when we should have been terrified.

 But you still should see it just so you can be a art of discussions, but I highly recomend u wait for it to come out on dvd then rent it.

I'm glad that I saw it on employee preview night. It just went on and on. Thats just IMHO though.

That puts them head and shoulders above the standard hollywood film. When Roger Ebert gave The Village one star, my heart sank. I'd been waiting to see it since the first trailer was shown. Roger was wrong, dead wrong. The movie works as a period piece, a love story, a story of faith and hope. The scenery and sets have real texture to them. The players are all very good. I read Ebert's review of Signs (he really liked that movie) and I saw the same strengths in Village. Go see it, it deserves much more than one star.",1091232000,3,653,4.274193548387097

It is a thriller that wants you to think about courage, love, fear. The film delivers a rich story of secrets with the elders knowing everything, fear with the 'creatures' of the forests and love between Ivy, a blind girl and the shy Lucius (Joaquin Phoneix).

I absolutely adored Phoenix' character in this film. He was mesmerising as the man of a few words but who cared so much for his village. In Gladiator, he showed that he was a formidable actor but in this, he shows he is a man of versatility. Adrien Brody - can he do any wrong in acting terms? No. Once again, he gives the audience a flawless performance as the mentally - handicapped Noah who ultimately brings pain. While Brody and Phoenix are acclaimed actors and justified too, Bryce Howard who played Ivy was simply fantastic. It was her love for Lucius that really powered this film.

The cinematography was superb too. Shyamalan uses light and darkness to great effect in this cinematic effort and it reminds me of 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' because this film is a visual success like that one. The costumes, the music (amazing violinists!) and the sombre mood make this film work once again because they create the mysterious aura of the film.

Final thought -- clever film with an impressive twist and finally glad to see Phoenix getting his time to shine; brilliant to see Hurt and Weaver showing why they are true actors.",1091232000,3,1633,4.54421768707483

In addition to the cinematography, the acting is top-notch, with Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron ""Opie"" Howard's daughter) in her break-out performance, Joaquin Phoenix in his best film since... well, since ""Signs,"" and Adrien Brody in his most meaningful film since ""The Pianist."" In conclusion, the film's score is so incredibly haunitng (with violin and what-not), it's a must-have on CD.

Meanwhile, a love triangle is forming amidst the youth of the village...which leads to a shocking brutality. Can young blind Ivy face her fears and enter the woods to save the man she loves?

I really enjoyed The Village. I would consider it my favorite M. Night movie...and I have seen them all. They are all deep, if you know what I mean. If you don't, I mean that they all deal with so much more than the issue at hand...and the theme is not always apparent to everyone. I would recommend this movie more for romance lovers than horror fans...I didn't find it very scary at all. I hope, although I doubt, that M. Night will make a sequel...or a prequel...or both.

 HORROR FANS BEWARE - This is NOT a horror film in any sense, nor even very suspenseful. There is no supernatural or even sinister element present.

 CAUTION: SPOILER AHEAD - THOUGH IF YOU'RE SMART YOU'LL READ ON ANYWAY.

 This waste of film is about a group of villagers, supposedly living in the 19th century, that are forbidden to go into the woods nearby, because allegedly some evil creatures live there. But there's a problem: children are dying from diseases that could be cured with the right medicine, and there is a path through the woods that leads into a town where the medicines can be bought. So one brave lad, who falls in love with the movie's heroine (played by Ron Howard's daughter) volunteers to go into town to get medical supplies. The village elders turn him down. Eventually he is knifed by a mentally challenged villager, and the leader of the group sends his daughter, who is totally blind, into the forbidden woods, to find the path that leads to town, where she can get medicine to cure him.

 Now here is where the ""twist"" becomes apparent: the village supposedly exists in the 19th century, but the girl is sent to get a medicine the elders know will fight internal infections (i.e penicillin, which wasn't invented until well into the 20th century).

 Surprise, surprise: the girl ends up making it through the woods (we find out that the ""Monsters"" were invented by the village elders, to keep their kids scared and close to home). She finds herself in the year 2004, where a clueless security guard finds her on the side of the road, then agrees to go get the antibiotics she needs. Then he sends her on her blind, merry way to stumble back through the woods, to the village, in time to save the injured guy's life.

 We learn that the village was created by a group of depressed 21st century city dwellers who decided to hide way back in the woods, where they recreate an Amish style of existence. After doing to they started popping out kids, and never bothered to tell them that just beyond the border of the woods there was a wonderful world filled with indoor toilets, electricity, modern medicine, TV and pizza. Instead they keep the kids in a perpetual state of terror so they don't develop independent, questioning minds of their own.

 Don't feel sympathy for the parents. Their devotion to the fairy tale world is so real that they let their kids die of diseases that could easily be cured in the outside world, rather than risk letting them be ""contaminated"" by civilization. They are child abusers and killers. God help anyone in the village who needs surgery - they'll just be left to die.

 If you've ever dreamt of giving up modern civilization for a 19th century style life, you might find much of this movie charming. Me, I found it nauseating. I suppose Shamalahn was trying to make some kind of ""statement"" about modern civilization, but all he accomplished was a dud of a movie that very few people will like. I'd like to send him back in time 120 years or so - and leave him there.",1091232000,4,3302,4.599659284497444

From what I've heard this movie is about a group of Mormons who live away from society and the Parents tellt hem scary stories from keeping them from going in the woods.  It is a scary film because of how the people ACT!  Not because of monsters.  If you want monsters go see Freddie veres Jason!!  If you want monsters then this movie is NOT FOR YOU!  so don't go tell people not to see it because you don't UNDERSTAND it!!!

2167977,4,B00064LJVO,"Whereas ""Signs"" was about the loss and recapture of one's faith ,rather than about aliens; ""The Village"", rather than being a ""things that go bump in the night"" thriller, delivers much more. This movie is all about love - love requited and unrequited, love that can survive the journey,no matter how treacherous or foreboding, and love as a force of nature that can breathe new life into even the most fragile and repressed of human beings. Beautifully scripted, acted, photographed and containing another effective musical score from James Newton Howard (What a talent!!! This man was born to write movie musical scores!!!), this film is first and foremost a moving love story that falls short of being a classic as the result of an anticlimactic and abrupt ending. I had figured out the twist before I arrived at the theatre. This helped me focus on the love story ""within"" the ""village"". How about another twist at the end M. Night Shyamalan? That would have been brilliant!!! (Though, there are many brilliant ""moments"" within this film!!!)
 If you approach this film with the expectation a seeing a moving love story, you will have a wonderfully satisfying experience. If you go expecting to have roller coaster ""Alien"" movie ride, you will be disappointed.
 I find the marketing for this project inspired!!! M. Night Shymalan has brought many moviegoers into this film who would never have given it a chance otherwise: and a magnificent chance it was, demonstrated by the sold out performance's ""you could hear a pin drop"" silence.

The bedrock is not the twist of the Sixth Sense, or the gore of a slasher movie.  Instead it is a luminescent, 19th century romance amid a dark and cloudy world.  If you can accept a romance movie by M. Night Shyamalan, you will find ample rewards in the rich acting of the two leads, including newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix.  Fear plays a role, but scaring the audience is not the point of the movie.  Love plays a larger role.  Expectations influence how a movie is received.  You don't want the plot spoiled before viewing, but know that it is the engaging characters you are trying to figure out, and not the plot twists.",1091232000,5,779,4.436619718309859

In this, he barely scares you with what you don't see. As much as I love him, this film wasn't bad but the hype that surrounded it and all the reports about ""hiding the script"" and ""hiding the filming"" and that ridiculous but very wellmade special on SciFi complete falsey advertised this film. It is not about monsters, or seemingly 17th century settles. Like all of his movies, this is about people, their interaction with eachother and their surroundings, and how view the world around us...kind of.

 Brody was very good but had a realiively small role. (Perhaps a Golden Globe nod may go his way. Joaquin and Sigourney were barely in it and when there were did little to develop a character that the audience could care about. Hurt was terrific as always but his crass and oddly worded script didn't do the justice to that character that I think Night was trying to create. The creature were creepy for about 5 seconds, the setting was impressive considering it consisted of a small village. Night had a neat little cameo that we did great in (as always) James Newton Howard's score was very minimal and compared nowhere to the score to Sixth Sense or Signs. While this was much much better than Unbreakable, I'd put it a distant 3rd behind Sixth Sense and Signs.

 This isn't a bad film, don't get me wrong, I will never doubt Shayalmalan's brilliance, but I think that it was marketed and adveristed in a completely misleading direction.

 It's got a one-note, unbelievable premise that would barely hold up a half-hour episode of ""The Twilight Zone."" (Actually, episodes of ""The Twilight Zone were far more clever than this movie.) It's got a horrid script featuring no lines spoken with prepositions, plot twists that could be guessed from a million miles away.

 To top it all off, the movie's not even scary. Not at all. The ad campaign, which makes this look like it's a HORROR movie about MONSTERS, is completely misleading.

 A better movie could be made of this premise if the movie didn't insist on keeping the whole premise a secret. A better movie could be made of this premise if it didn't insist on being so dark, bleak and falsely suspenseful.

 The way it's written, the actors are given little to do. The characters have little life, no charisma with one another and feature no one among them who is individual enough to care about.

 Don't see ""The Village."" There is little worth watching in it.",1091232000,3,1183,4.783251231527093
2167983,1,B00064LJVO,"I took one look at the trailer and I decided right then and there- this looked like the horror/suspense flick that I'd been waiting for. I headed down to the theater, dragged some of my friends along and anxiously awaited the start of what I assumed would be a kick-a$$ thriller.

 Boy was I wrong.

 GOD HOW I WISH SOMEONE HAD SLAPPED ME SILLY BEFORE GOING TO SEE THIS MOVIE!

 I felt SOOOOO embarrassed and ashamed for making my friends watch it with me, never have I ever been so disappointed in my life!

 Why am I ranting like this? Simple. THE FILM WAS FALSELY ADVERTISED. When something is advertised as a horror/suspense/thriller, the audience will obviously expect a horror/suspense/thriller. What did we get? An emotional, dramatic love story. OK I will admit that the film had it's moments, (the best moment being the girl's journey through the woods at the end of the story) but the biggest letdown of all? The image of the ""scary"" creatures from the woods. Ha! If you've seen the movie you know what I mean.

 Anything positive about the film? The acting from the leading lady was brilliant and her emotional expressions were incredible.

 I adore love stories/emotional films just as much as the next person but something this incredibly slow paced (and going in with the expectations of a ""scary"" flick?)!! How can anyone NOT be disappointed? Even from the angle of a love story, it's very very dull.

 Even the ticket sellers were laughing at the audience as they leaved the theater b/c even they knew that the film would be a letdown for us all.

 I've seen a few other reviewers giving praise to the film, which surprised me b/c as a typical audience member I waited and waited to find something praiseworthy about it and couldn't find anything. (except for the acting)

 And I hear about this surprise twist end that's apparently in the story? Don't expect too much from that. The end was so abrupt that I was blinking at the screen wondering what in the hell just happened? And I don't mean this in a good way (as in a spooky cliffhanger way). After torturing us through all the slow and sappy moments of the love story between the two characters, we never even get to see a proper end with them. I think that was what made me madder than anything else.

 I've never written a film review in my life, but after watching something like this, I couldn't help myself. If you have the same expectations like I did and are expecting to see something suspenseful living up to the Sixth Sense, then I warn you now, PLEAZZZZE save yourself the agony of 1hr and 7 minutes. Don't waste your money.",1091232000,2,2607,4.565591397849462
2167984,2,B00064LJVO,"Loads of people on Amazon have already stated exactly what I want to say, so I'll just give my two-cents: 'The Village' is extremely misleading, uneventful, predictable, and most of all NOT A HORROR FILM AS ADVERTISED.

 Lots of reviewers stated that the twist ending of this film was easy to predict within the first 10 minutes of this film. I, personally, was surprised by the ending (maybe I'm slow?), but was supremely let down by the ending. It falls flat and makes you feel stupid for spending $7.50 on a ticket.

 This film is not a horror film. Nor is it a suspense thriller. It is simply a romantic drama with a spooky back-drop. If I wanted to see a romantic drama, I would have walked into the next theater over and saw ""The Notebook"". The idea of this film could have taken off, but it crash-landed soon into flight. So many things could have been written differently and just... grrrr! It's so frustruating because ""The Village"" could have been so much more.",1091232000,2,971,4.563218390804598

This is one of those films that I actually like more now that I have had a day to think about it. It isn't really that scary, though a couple of scenes made some people in the audience jump and scream. This is M. Night's best cast yet and all the acting is first rate (especially Bryce Howard in her debut), the music is chilling and beautiful at times, and the direction is first rate. I have to admit I figured out the ending about 10 minutes into the film only because I have seen enough Sci-Fi films and Twilight Zone episodes to guide me down the road I knew Night was going to take, but to my surprise most people in the audience had no idea. If you like slow building thrillers, which M. Night is known for, you know what kind of film this is going to be.

 Of course I figuered out that it was the adults scaring the youth to keep them in line before I even went to the movie, but did anyone actualy see the ending? The blind girl made it through& back through the woods on her own itno a very ""Modern"" world. They were living in a very ""self contained"" world, now that was scare. Butr M.

2167988,1,B00064LJVO,"As far as I'm concerned, that's a more riveting picture than the overly lackluster M. Night 'canvas-picture', 'The Village.' What I could only describe as undercooked, dry, and palid with emotion, this film is just that. Forget anything you've seen in the falsified advertisements, this is not that film. In fact, stay home and read some HP Lovecraft, and you're bound for a far more entertaining night. Yes, my friends, 'The Village' is that bad.

 In all of M. Night's intriguing films, and this is not sarcastic, I do love his films, he uses a formula. Build up, build up, tension, scare, twist. It's standard now. In fact, it's so standard, I was able to call this entire film, two weeks ago, before I even saw the thing. If that doesn't tell you about the writing, then I guess I'll have to say it, 'this is one of the most poorly written films, ever.' And, I loved 'Signs', even enjoyed 'Unbreakable' albeit overly depressing, and yes, 'The Sixth Sense' gets me, even to this day. Let me tell you more on this 'Village.'

 The film is not a horror film and it is not a thrillfest, it really isn't. 'Are You Afraid of the Dark' accomplished that better. No, no, this film is a romantic drama with an eerie backdrop. It's social commentary without any of the real context. It's well, crap. The writing as far as I'm concerned is what really drags this film down. We watch as characters are haunted by 'monsters' in the woods, yet we don't feel for them. Why? Because they are highly underdeveloped and they never go anywhere, with the exception maybe of Mr. Ron Howard's daughter, who does a fine job acting, but her character is flawed. All the characters are flawed, even William Hurt's, one of America's finest actors.

 What else can I say without being so subtle and telling you to just go see 'I, Robot' or 'Spiderman 2' again? Well, the directing itself would have raised the bar on this film. As usual, M. Night does not fail in creating a visually stunning film, but what does it matter if the rest fails miserably. Even James Newton Howard's score is underwhelming...it does nothing, until maybe the the end, but even then, it doesn't fit.

 And also, the social commentary, I can't say anything for 'fear' that I'll ruin this ""contemporary classic."" But, if he wanted to lay very great themes down...he should have made sure the other things worked as well. You don't realize something if what's there is as jumbled as a five year old completing a 400 piece puzzle. You just don't. I understand where he was coming from, but no, I didn't enjoy coming to that conclusion, so therefore, he failed.

 With the acting there, but directed nowhere(thanks to Hollywood's finest...worst screenplay), and the direction solid but output unstable, this film is a catastrophe. I felt like I was on a rollercoaster, but one that never left and when it finally did, it started and then stopped. Needless to say, last night, I left the broken rollercoaster, having paid, and never getting the price I payed.

 Rent 'Signs' or better yet, do read HP Lovecraft. It's far more intelligent, and if you want great thrills, that actually are thrills, then you'd be happy. But, don't see this, this is another excuse to not see movies this summer. Sorry guys, I was looking forward to this, a little, too.",1091232000,4,3298,4.657487091222031
2167989,5,B00064LJVO,"I was appalled to see all of the negative reviews for ""The Village"", especially the A.O. Scott review in ""The New York Times"", where he made possibly the stupidest journalistic remark I have read this year when he said that the colors in ""The Village"" had to do with terrorism alert warnings. How ignorant. You'd think he would at least PRETEND to have studied the significance of colors in Indian culture ... but I digress.

 Have you ever heard of something called, ""A thinking person's movie""? You know, movies like ""The Night of the Hunter"", ""The Virgin Spring"", and ""Spellbound""? Hint hint: I'm not talking about movies such as ""The Terminator"", ""Aliens"", or ""Jeepers Creepers"" here (which are all good movies in their own way, but not THINKING movies).

 M. Night Shyamalan's movies are for people who like to THINK while they are watching a movie, not just sit back and be mindlessly entertained. I guess that make them movies that are not fit for the average American, as harsh as that may sound (hey, I work with the public; I'm allowed to say that! See the website customerssuck.com for more illumination on this topic).

 ""The Village"" is a beautiful, masterful, hypnotic gem of a movie that will stay strong in your mind for days after you have seen it, and it will stay with you for life if you let it.

 It's too bad that the white male elite Baby Boomers who are in charge of telling us what is good and what is not in American entertainment media are so threatened by M. Night Shyamalan that they will not even give him the respect of taking his movies seriously. Hey, I guess that everything George Carlin has to say about the American elite's attitude toward ""brown people"" is true (see George Carlin's books and stand-up for more information).

 It is very obvious to me that Shyamalan is a victim of racism -- how dare an Indian make cutting edge movies? What nerve -- his parents moved to America from India, became doctors, and sent their son to NYU. And now he is trying to show us art, and even move art into popular culture! Shouldn't those actions be reserved for the Pale Males? Aren't they in charge of popular culture? I mean, if people of color want to make nice little art house indie films about racism and such, that's fine, but make artful movies about other topics and move them into popular culture? How out of line.

 That's the attitude I'm seeing.

 I'm glad someone of my generation is brave enough to make films about the topics that are archetypical to Gen X-ers, such as UFO's, ghosts, and monsters in the woods. Oh, and religion.

 Because ultimately, that is what ""The Village"" is about.

 ""The Village"" has a few messages of its own that are thought-provoking, but not enough to have me recommend visiting a theater to view this movie. The BIG advantage to viewing this particular picture sooner, will be to avoid having some jerk obliterate the ending for you.

 It WAS NOT scary, at all. Although, I must admit this one had the old tummy twisted in knots the entire time. If you like that sort of thing (with a so-so payoff at the end,) then this is the movie for you.

I rarely re-write reviews, but I felt this one deserved it. I was disappointed the first time I saw it, giving the movie just two stars. I've raised it to THREE, (though I can't get the stars (located avove) to change, and while some may say that three still isn't good considering how many people love throwing out fours and fives (I'm one of them), I think three is a good score, shall we say.

So what's with the change? After viewing the movie for a second time, this time with my three year old, sophiscated cousin Emily seated at my side (she loves Signs and The Poltergeist), I decided that I didn't give the actors or the script enough kudos the first time. Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard are marvelous and have beautiful chemistry that you have to see for yourself. I love the script (though I'm not so sure I quite like everything about the plot). The language is fantastic-- M. Night really deserves accolades for it.

The story-- Set in the late 1800s, the villagers live a peaceful, violent free life... oh, except for the terrible monsters that live in the woods which surround their tiny village. The villagers hide the color red because it is ""the bad color"" and attracts the freaky looking, spiky monsters. The color yellow is the good color; yellow banners line the village and watch guards wear yellow capes. Joaquin is Lucius, a quiet guy who is not afraid of ""those they do not speak of,"" only afraid for the welfare of Ivy (Howard).

And what will happen when, because of dire circumstances I will not reveal here, they must venture into the woods.

Heed this warning now

For they are coming ...

Over the last few years, the supernatural thriller genre has belonged solely to one individual: writer/director M. Night Shyamalan. Though several others have tried to copy his exact style of filmmaking, complete with the signature twist ending, few have developed the same kind of success he has enjoyed, whether it concerns the numbers at the box office or the fan base his films have developed. Ever since 1999's surprise fall hit, The Sixth Sense, M. Night Shyamalan has been terrifying audiences across the world with his takes on ghosts, superheroes, and aliens, but after several years it seems as though he may be giving the old gig a break for awhile. Reports leaking out of Hollywood have indicated that The Village may be the last thriller he will work on for awhile as his next project is set to be the film adaptation of the novel, The Lady in the Water. Preferably he would like to go out on top in the genre he essentially perfected but that is all up to how the American public will receive it, or reject it.

The story centers on an isolated group of villagers who find themselves confined to their town by the mysterious creatures that roam the woods that encircle them. In the year 1897, the village of Covington, Pennsylvania can be seen as the prime example of a utopian society - there is no violence, no greed, and all work together in upholding the vision of hope that has driven the villagers to bountiful blessings, something the elders of the town believe will continue through the leadership of their children. Covington, to the untrained eye, may seem perfect but the element of fear still dwells within the occupants of the town. What would inhabitants of a utopian society such as this have to fear? ""Those we do not speak of"" - red hooded creatures that reside in the woods and make raids on the town when they feel they have been threatened. None have the courage to venture beyond the forbidden border, except Lucius Hunt, the head strong yet reserved son of Alice Hunt, one of the town elders. Lucius feels compelled to defy the boundaries of the village but at the same time he dares not leave out of the fear, the only one he has, that harm will come to Ivy Walker, the blind daughter of the leading town elder with whom he has fallen deeply in love with. But when an accident occurs in the village and Lucius is found seriously injured, Ivy demands that she be given permission to enter the woods and obtain medicine from the nearby towns.

The story for The Village sadly suffers from an acute identity crisis, playing out more like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone then the usual Shyamalan thriller fare audience have come acquainted with. This is not to say that it does not attempt to be entertaining. In fact the first half is actually quite engaging, but around the midway point everything begins to fall apart rather extensively. Another Shyamalan feature, The Sixth Sense, suffered a similar trait to that of The Village, this being the less then surprising twist ending. If this film was able to have as genuine and masterfully orchestrated a storyline as The Sixth Sense had then it more then likely would not have been a problem. Unfortunately, Shyamalan demonstrates clearly that he is either losing his once golden touch or he is running low on decent material to scare audiences with.

With as talented an accumulation of performers as is seen in The Village, the most high-profile cast ever assembled by director M. Night Shyamalan, you would believe it would be no problem for a film with as weak of a script as this to be brought up to the level of at least some toleration but that is not true here. Bryce Dallas Howard, credited in the film industry as only being the daughter of director Ron Howard, makes a surprisingly brilliant debut in the role of Ivy Walker, the blind daughter of the leading town elder. All Shyamalan films contain a lead role that tests even the most skilled of actors and Howard is able to tackle the role easily without showing once any inability to rise to the challenge, which indicates she could be a rising star in Hollywood if she continues to give prime performances such as this. Joaquin Phoenix, in the role of Lucius Hunt, demonstrates that he certainly has the charisma and talent to lead a film with an engaging and emotionally driven performance, far exceeding the role given to him for Signs. And Adrien Brody gives an emotionally charged, if not often perplexing, roller coaster performance as Noah, the mentally challenged son of the leading town elder. There are times where he can make you laugh, make cry, have you feel sorry for him only to turn around and do something that provokes the opposite effect with the audience. The character of Noah is the combination of both the talent of Brody and dexterous construction from Shymalan's script. The problem with the cast is that there are too many of them for the audience to keep track of each individual character plot. The brilliance about Shyamalan's past films was that he kept the group of characters relatively small in order to allow the audience to singularly focus on the actions of the main characters and not have them confused by separate character developments. The filmmaker diverts from his usually agenda and that in effect hurts the film's script severely.

Overall, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan trades in his philanthropic messages on humanity and supernatural fantasies come to life for some cheap scares and a story that may turn out to be an accidental rip off of a classic science-fiction television series. Though Shyamalan makes no direct assertions within the nearly two hour long feature and leaves this up to interpretation, there are slight assumption that The Village may be a political commentary on the current climate of the United States following the September 11th terrorist attacks.

What evidence is there within the framework of the film that would support this theory? For starters, the color coded system the villagers develop, yellow indicating safety and red implying fear and danger, overtly resembles the terrorism warning levels developed by Homeland Security Department following the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The creatures that wander the woods and raid the town when threatened are nothing more then false reports developed by the elders to keep the townspeople in fear and prevent them from leaving the village, which may be a reference to the accusations made by the liberals about the Bush administration whenever they release a terror alert. And the most convenient piece of evidence lies in the name of the lead elder who orchestrates the entire faade: Walker, which may or may not be an allusion to the current commander in chief's middle name. True, the deception was performance in order to preserve the innocence of the children, but as the old saying goes, the road to Hell is paved with good intentions.

Even if that theory were to be proven true, only a hand full of individuals would probably pick up on the message and it would not affect a person's perception of the film even if he/she agreed with what was being said. In other aspects of the film, James Newton Howard is once again able to calibrate a successful and chilling musical score that works directly in sync with the actions on screen, as he has been able to do in all of Shyamalan's films in the past. And even though Shyamalan's engaging sense of direction allows the psychological intensity of the film to remain intact through nearly the entire presentation, the less then surprising outcomes makes it out to be all for naught. There are three twist endings to the film: the first seems misplaced as it totally eliminates the element of fear that is associated with the creatures, the second isn't so much a problem as it is obvious especially if you're one who pays close attention to certain characters, and the final twist gives you the feeling as though you were watching an episode of The Twilight Zone, leaving the audience neither shocked nor amazed, just swindled. But the film's most disappointing aspect is the fact that the audience is left at the end with nothing; no fear, no hope. The Village is the first Shyamalan thriller that eliminates the sense of fear movie-goers would take home with them when it reveals the creatures weren't real. This was the key that made Shymalan thrillers classics to so many people. Whether it is a political allegory or merely a coincidence, either way you slice it The Village is a sure-fire disappointment.",1091145600,5,8822,4.769482645710544
2167999,2,B00064LJVO,"The trailers for The Village looked really good. I especially liked the one that showed clips of M. Night Shyamalan's past films. There was one problem that I had with the trailers. They introduced the film as M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village."" When the director's name appears above the title of the film in order to appeal to an audience, that, in itself, is scary.

 The film opens in an amish-Puritan type of setting. We are quickly introduced to people known as the elders (including William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, and Brendan Gleeson), the village idiot (Adrien Brody), and the calm guy Lucious (Joaquin Phoenix). We learn that there are creatures in the woods that surround the village and that the villagers are not allowed to enter those woods. We also learn that the creatures, who are attracted by the color red, will not disturb the village unless the village disturbs them. Guess what, Lucios disturbs them.

 The creatures randomly enter the village and leaves signs of their existence like red slash marks on the doors, skinned animals, and sightings. This creeps out the people bad enough to make them hide in underground shelters.

 Later on, Lucious is hurt and his love interest (Bryce Dallas Howard) has to leave the village to go to a town for medical supplies. While out, she is chased by a creature and has to be clever in order to escape it. She is able to reach the town and return with supplies.

 Of course, with this being a Shyamalan film, you can expect to see a twist. There is a twist, although, by the end of the film, there really isn't much of one.

 The actors do a good job. There just isn't much for them to work with. Like I said, I was really excited about the film because of the trailers. Also, as actors were being named to the project, it made me even more intrigued. Joaquin is back in his second Shyamalan film, and I really like him and don't think he gets enough credit for some of his roles. There was also the addition of Adrien Brody, who looks creepy anyway. I was hoping he would have a role like Samuel L. Jackson did in ""Unbreakable,"" but he didn't.

 There are little bits of clues placed throughout the movie as to the ending. One person said that ""any person with half a brain could figure out the ending within the first 10 minutes of the film."" Apparently, I don't have half a brain because I couldn't do it in 10 minutes, more like 45. I'm a little slow, perhaps.

 This movie just did not grasp me. I wanted to like it, but I never could get in to it. Things would happen, and I would just be like ""eh."" It just wasn't scary, frightening, suspenseful, or that interesting. I guess I should have known. I don't really like walking into the woods anyways.",1091145600,2,2717,4.495934959349594
2168000,4,B00064LJVO,"To me, Night is our generations Alfred Hitchcock (did I spell that right?) and I think that's good because we need a writer/director who can come up with good stories and good twists. I didn't come into this movie thinking I was going to be amazed. Quite the contrary, actually. The Sixth sense was was amazing, Signs I consider one of the best ""invasion"" movies of all time, but Unbreakable was probably one of the top 5 most boring movies I've ever seen in my life, so i knew that there was a good chance that this movie wasn't going to be great.

 It isn't great, but it is really good. It definitly has a Night feel to it with soft speaking, slow pace, and slow plot development, but if you've seen any of his previous three this shoudn't come as a surprise to you. Like his others I think twenty minutes could have easily been shaved off, but then the movie probably wouldn't have its feel.

 I'm not gonna talk about the plot since every other review does, but I will say it wasn't very scary, but that wasn't a bad thing to me. It was a great mystery in which I had no idea where it was going until the last moment. Night obviously has a vivid and creative imagination, and I hope he keeps coming up with great stories, some of which I'm sure won't be good, but nobodies perfect.

 The bottom line is if you like his movies go see it. If you have a short attention span see I Robot or Spider-man (I'm not trying to be offensive, I like both of those movies). Night has a great style and mind, and I cannot wait for his next attempt, which hopefully won't be as bad as unbreakable. The Village is a good movie with a good story and I found it very satisfying.",1091145600,2,1665,4.220125786163522
2168001,4,B00064LJVO,"I expected this to be another horrifying Shymalan flick, but it wasn't quite. The beginning of the flick up to about 50 minutes, there's a great plot going about an apparently 19th-century village living in fear of the creatures that live in the woods. The hauntin atmosphere is set my a lot of silence, slow-moving (but appropriately) scenes and the paranoia of what's in the woods that stays inside all the villagers. I must confess, when the ""creatures"" came out of the woods and ran by underneath the watch-out tower and left red marks on all the doors that I was quite scared.

 Also, in the first 50 minutes, a romance develops between a blind village girl named Ivy and a overly shy and quiet town boy (played by Phoenix, I believe his second time in a Shymalan film). The romance almost seems like a side-plot, but it eventually becomes major matter.

 If you don't want to hear a small spoiler, don't read this paragraph. There is also a mentally challened (I think that's what he ways) man played amazingly by Adrien Brody who later, for no apparent reason, kills Phoenix's character right after he and Ivy agree to get married. Ivy knows that there is another town on the other side of the woods with medicine to cure the infectious stab wounds Phoenix received, so she asks her father for permission to go through the woods, even though filled with ""creatures"" and go to the next town for the one she loves.

 That's where the plot takes a major twist.

 A lot of the movie actually ends up focusing on the relationship between Phoenix & Ivy, but that's necessary because it shows you the love they have for each other and eventually makes it more believable that Ivy would go to great lengths such as this to heal Phoenix.

 I won't say just what happens, but it is a bit of a disappointment. I wish they just stayed with the original plot and worked with that, but it wasn't a total let-down. Even though it wasn't very scary after you realize what's really going on, it's still just as entertaining and still want to see what happens. So...don't go to this movie expected a super-terrifying horror movie like the advertisements suggest it is. The ads are definetly misleading, and though I would probably have given this a 5 if it just stuck with the main plot, it still gets a 4 because it's entertaining.

 Excellent acting by the lead woman actor who plays Ivy. I forgot her name, but I wonder if she's been in any other movies.",1091145600,,2446,4.546697038724374
2168002,4,B00064LJVO,"Film about an almost Amish-like community who have made a pact or truce with ominous and dangerous ""creatures"" beyond their village to never go into their territory and disturb them and that which they inhabit. Many of the villagers themselves, especially the young have never wandered past the community and into the woods or the ""outside"" world in their entire lives! They know no outside world. Sounds simple and easy enough to uphold the law of never breaking the barrier right?However, the barrier is finally breached by someone. In addition, pets and farm animals are mysteriously mutilated and a tragedy occurs forcing certain members to consider breaching the barrier again to seek outside help...The council elders also have ""secrets"" of their own they are hiding...

 Unfortunately, so many reviewers have given almost EVERYTHING away before others have had the chance to see it and form their own opinions...I'll admit I am guilty of reading a few of these before I went and saw it tonight despite the plot or story freebies given by others...However,the more I think about this film, the more I actually was intrigued and really liked it. Part suspense, a hint of horror, drama, and the ever popular ""thought -I -knew -what -it -was- about"" routine...Shyamalan pretty much does what he did for Unbreakable (though, to me Unbreakable was such a let down and painfully slow at times) in that the viewer is led to believe the film is about one thing through the excellent previews to entice audiences. This is done to the point where as a viewer you may even think you have the type of genre the movie is pegged. Wrong. In this respect this is his gift or talent as a story teller to keep you hooked along with superb marketing and advertising tactics. Afterwards, you decide if it was intriguing or not. You really don't know what the twist or ending is really going to be despite the true nature revealed in the middle of the film of what the evil is that lurks beyond the village's borders. I'll admit that The Village does have it's slow paced moments but not enough to lull anyone into a coma. I will say this, the ending will definitely surprise audiences more than shock! The ending is strongly reminiscent of an old black and white Twilight Zone episode...Maybe that's the only thing director Shyamalan can be accused of is probably being influenced or slightly borrowing the concept from but giving it his own spin or panache.

 The performances by various top name actors were excellent(particularly Ron Howoard's daughter as the portrayal of a blind girl) but none overshadowed or vied for the spotlight over the other. Don't be put off by the negative reviews. When the story ends one can definitely say it was not your average or normal typical ending for this type of film (what type of film? You decide)!

 Much better than Unbreakable, not as scary or suspenseful as Signs, and nowhere near as somewhat intriguing or chilling as The Sixth Sense...The Village still entertains in it's own right, though.",1091145600,2,3027,4.833976833976834
2168003,2,B00064LJVO,"In the long run, this movie was quite a letdown. Unlike the fabulous SIGNS, this movie will scare you the first time only. The plot is very promising, as is the beginning of the film. A ninteenth century village is surrounded by a forbidden forest inhabited by vicious ""creatures"". Both have an understanding not to intrude upon eachother's area. But one night, the peace is broken...

 Sound spooky? Well, that's how the previews played it. I won't give anything away because this movie will scare the bejezus out of you then make you feel stupid for bein scared at the end. My problem is that after you see this movie once, it will never scare you again because you know how it will turn out. The magic of Shyamalan's scare tactics, which was worked o perfection in SIGNS, is that the threat is right around the corner and could jump out at any time - but it doesn't, and you can cut the tension with a knife. It works every time, but not in THE VILLAGE.",1091145600,3,956,4.426136363636363
2168004,2,B00064LJVO,"I insisted on seeing this movie despite all the bad reviews. Critics warned that most people who saw it would feel cheated and bored, but I just wouldn't listen. Guess what. After seeing the movie, I feel cheated and bored. To explain exactly why I feel that way, I'd have to give the plot away. So I'll just give a general review.

 Overall, his isn't a bad film in the same way that ""Battlefield Earth"" and ""Gigli"" are bad films. The movie's biggest problem is that it fails, big-time, to live up to its own advertising campaign. Although the story idea is good, the screenplay never takes advantage of the many opportunities the story affords for scaring and mystifying the audience. Although this movie needed a better script, even a good editor with a sharp pair of scissors could have made the film scarier by resequencing certain scenes so that secrets were not revealed at the wrong time.

 This movie is an example of what sometimes happens when a director, successful enough to demand full creative control, runs the ship aground because there's nobody aboard with the authority to stop him. The critics are the only ones empowered to tell him he made a mistake. And by then it's too late.",1091145600,2,1199,4.668246445497631

If you go to watch this film expecting a solid scary and powerful film ala Signs, forget it.  This film is Manoj Night Shyamalan's worst offering.  Even without comparing The Village to M's previous works, this film still flops horribly.  Anticlimactic is the best word to describe it.  Anticlimactic and indolent.

I sat there waiting for it to get scary and it never happened! There were only two shocks throughout the entire film! And the film ending with the blind chick saying ""I'm back"" is hardly going to build a following! The Sixth Sense, Signs, and Unbreakable all had a many powerful and shocking scenes while this one was given the opportunity to succeed, but failed greatly. If they could go back in time and re-write the script I'm sure they would after reading the slamming review Ebert and Roper gave them! So anyway, Shayamalan thought up an origional idea that could have done great at the box-office and ruined it by crappy screen play! He was on a role and struck out big time with this one!",1091145600,,1011,4.326315789473684
2168010,5,B00064LJVO,"Unlike many here, I won't destroy this film by hinting anything except the premise. We witness a tiny community in the middle of the woods. They live in the valley in simplistic harmony, but around them in the woods are beastly creatures who have struck an unspoken alliance with them: don't cross into our woods, and we won't cross into your village. This seems to work out quite well until the day some children find a dead dog with all it's hair and much of its skin removed. Is it the work of a deranged wolf or are the creatures warning the villagers that the alliance is on thin ice?

 In typical creative fashion, Shyamalan builds the suspense and right about the time you say to yourself, ""I've figured it out,"" M. Night throws us a series of curve balls that will leave many of us spellboud. Cynics and fans of Dawn of the Dead, however, might be highly disappointed.

 THIS IS AS GOOD AS ANYTHING ELSE M. NIGHT HAS PUT OUT. Believe me. I ruthlessly look for flaws in any movie and I came away from this one amazed and in awe as usual. Even my writer's mind was only half right when I began toying with what Shyamalan would throw at me in this film. If you love thinker's film, all with an abundant amount of unpredictability and a heavy dose of unease and suspense, SEE THIS FILM.

I think that had I not expected lots of terror I would have a better idea now of what I think about the actual film I saw. It did have some provocative (and timely) political allegory, and the second revelation (what's in the metal box?) caught me by surprise and made me feel great sympathy for the characters. The first twist, though, was sort of on the level of a Scooby Doo mystery. I guess I would have been more satisfied initially had the film been more like the trailer suggested, but I like that Shyamalan always manages to undermine my expectations while not leaving me utterly disappointed. I'm sure that, like ""Signs"" before it, ""The Village"" will grow on me upon seeing it again.",1091145600,3,777,4.402777777777778

 Village"". AWESOME! I was completely blind-sided by

 this one. I expected a horror/sci fi thriller like M.

 Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs"".

 Instead, I found one of the most captivating love

 stories I've ever viewed. Before I go any further, I

 must say that if any of you are true

 romantics...like thought-provoking love stories...then

 you will undoubtedly place ""the porch scene"" in your

 mental scrapbook of memorable love scenes. If this

 one doesn't have Academy written all over it, nothing

 does. This is by far the best directed, scripted and

 edited film I've seen in a long, long time. Bryce

 Dallas Howard as Ivy is one of the most convincing

 performances on record. I went with my son and his

 girlfriend. She walks out of the theatre saying, ""Am

 I a total girl or what? I cried through the whole

 movie."" I walked up to her and said, ""don't feel bad,

 I did, too"". Bryce deserves to be in the running for

 Best Actress come March. And, Adrien Brody's

 portrayal of Noah should garner a Supporting Actor

 nod. Add to that Joaquin Phoenix (starred in

 ""Gladiator"" and ""Signs"") as Lucius, Sigourney Weaver

 as Alice Hunt, and William Hurt as Edward Walker.

 Shyamalan's casting is superb. The script is near

 perfect. It's a film where words play a much greater

 role than sound effects and costumes. As you know, I

 never give away a plot. I definitely can't with this

 one. The twists are intertwined at moments when you

 think you just figured out the stunning ending. I'll

 be one of the first in line to buy the DVD...even if

 it's just for ""the porch scene"". And...I would be

 remiss if I didn't add that this flick may also get a

 Best Film nomination. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being

 the highest), ""The Village"" gets an 11 in what has to

 be a new genre'. I would call this a romantic

 thriller/adventure. Nothing like it! GO SEE IT! And

 please, take someone with you to hold hands (my dog

It's kind of hard to explain it without giving anything away, so I'll just leave it at that.

Performances were pretty good.  Ron Howard's daughter did a darn good job playing a blind girl.  Adrien Brody did a good job playing the village idiot, a quirky turn after his Oscar.  An ensemble cast of sorts, nobody really runs the show or overshadows the others except perhaps Howard's daughter.
