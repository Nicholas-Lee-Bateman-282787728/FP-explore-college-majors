5164988,5,B008HA8ZXO,"It is true that western civilization has exported its share of insidious values to countries considered ""lesser developed,"" but this movie celebrates an important POSITIVE western value:  that an individual life is not predetermined by ""destiny"" and that, instead, each of us creates our lives by our actions, choices and decisions.  To believe that one is powerless over the circumstances of his own life is a defeatist attitude plaguing individuals in EVERY culture (to be sure) but it continues to be culturally enforced in countries like India where the caste system was once entrenched.

Chhotu (who eventually changes his name to Kalam) is a 9 or 10 year old Indian boy ""with a mind as quick as a train"" born to a single mother in a small, famine-plagued village.  To repay debt, Chhotu's mother hires him out to work in an outdoor cafe:  she chides him that school is ""not in the destiny"" of a poor family like theirs, but Chhotu/Kalam believes in himself and in his dream of growing up to be an educated man of importance.  He never lies and never gives up on himself -- and, in the end, accomplishes his goals despite seemingly insurmountable obstacles.

I don't want to say more because this movie deserves to be discovered on its own, without advance spoilers.",1402185600,,1271,4.802752293577981

5164990,5,B008HA8ZXO,"My son and I really liked this movie.  Was fun, light hearted but emotional.  Recommend this very strongly.  It's partly subtitled and partly in english.  That it went back and forth was pretty cool actually and added to the atmosphere.  Appropriate for ages 9-adult I'd think, although really nothing a younger child couldn't see.",1395964800,,331,5.055555555555555

5165000,5,B008HA8ZXO,"As someone who has never been to India I found this film deeply satisfying for the story and the setting. But most of all, for the two boys who play kids from the opposite side of the tracks but with complementary personalities. The kids are working to have a relationship without the limitations placed by adults worried about the divisions of class and money. Kalam is very resilient. The story is about how his curiosity and drive open the world to him in spite of many barriers.
A great film to watch with children. Easy to follow without understanding the language.",1438300800,,570,4.653465346534653

8528146,4,B008HA8ZXO,"The acting is absolutely cringe-worthy at times. That's the only thing keeping this from getting five stars. Other than that, it's a sweet movie with a good story and characters that make you root for them.

I think this is definitely worth a watch, especially if you can stream it for free.",1529712000,,291,4.596153846153846
