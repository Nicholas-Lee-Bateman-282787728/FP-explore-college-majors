It was almost Hitchcockian, although the Sutherland character was no ordinary ""everyman,"" but a high ranking member of the Polish Politburo during the Cold War.  Very underrated movie.  But deserving of the 5 stars given.",1431907200,,317,4.9245283018867925

Buy this film, show it to your friends and relatives.  This what Cuba, Veneuzuela, People's Republic of China and North Korea are today.",1198281600,2,235,4.441860465116279
