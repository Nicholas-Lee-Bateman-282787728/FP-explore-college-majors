8443801,4,B004VQRCH8,"The 1st disc (Europe, African Rift & The Pacific Rim: Americas) is better than the 2nd (Western Pacific Rim & Asia). But they miss real opportunities, such as naming Siccar Point in Scotland, even though they show it (though way too quickly). The 2nd disc has meandering narration. But, I'm glad I watched it.",1396656000,,309,4.7407407407407405

Geologic Journey II 2 disc set.
I also own the entire How the Earth Was Made seasons and other How the Earth Was Made DVD's and the Geologic Journey II compliment each other very well.",1372896000,,317,4.482758620689655
