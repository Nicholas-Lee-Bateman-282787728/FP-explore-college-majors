8276416,5,B001A8HGAI,"I recommend the 8 DVD of the collection of this encyclopedia of BJJ carried out by D. Marcus Vinicius DI Luca.
All the information is perfectly structured, in a such way that, the teaching is very simple for the logic of the teaching method.
The explanations understand all the necessary details to understand all the explained movements perfectly.
In my modest opinion, the initial formation in JUDO of the Teacher Marcus Vinicius facilitates the teaching methodology a lot and it simplifies the understanding of its teaching a lot.
I believe that ALL the DVD of the encyclopedia is basic for all the people that already begin in BJJ, and a very good tool of consultation for people initiate.
For everything it, I recommend the complete purchase of the 8 DVD.",1414195200,,760,4.8538461538461535
8276417,5,B001A8HGAI,"i saw this dvd series awhile back and considered purchasing it but the lack of reviews made me wary.  i was fortunate enough to come across this entire dvd (volume 2 only) on online tonight and was impressed by the detail, clarity of the explanations, and the wealth of information.  Marcus covers many different guards to pass:  closed, open, butterfly, spider, side guard (no de la riva) and covers different ways to pass all of them including standing and kneeling passes.  he also gives you counters for when your opponent blocks your pass.

because i saw this one dvd and was so impressed with the content, i'll be purchasing some of the others in the series.",1402790400,,664,4.689655172413793
8276418,5,B001A8HGAI,DVD is a great tool for BJJ beginners. It outlines various passing the guard techniques from sitting to standing within the guard.,1393459200,,130,4.954545454545454
8276419,5,B001A8HGAI,"I've started off all of my reviews with a notice that I have trained with Marcus for the past 5 years but I do own and watch all of these DVDs.

As anyone who has trained in Jiu Jitsu knows, passing the guard can be one of the hardest parts of the sport.  There are tons of videos on YouTube showing amazing passes from some of the greatest competitors.  While these are fun to watch, the way Roger Gracie tries to pass Xande Riberio's guard is a little different from how I will need to pass a blue or purple belts guard.  This series is about the little details of the basic passes for many different types of guards like closed, open, butterfly, spider, etc.  If you have trained for awhile, you will probably have seen and drilled some or most of these passes but how many of these can you consistently execute in sparring?  While I know most of these, I cannot always make them work against other strong competitors.  I then I go back and watch this DVD and realize that there were one or two details that I wasn't executing properly.  In my opinion, this is how you really develop your game in Jiu Jitsu.  It is a huge help having these lessons on DVD so that I can listen to the lesson that I need when I need it.

Great DVD and well worth it!",1329091200,,1250,4.192468619246862
