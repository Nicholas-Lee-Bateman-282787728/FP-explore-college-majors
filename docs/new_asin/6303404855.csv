(Note: this review is exclusively for the Miss Marple mystery ""Nemesis"" on VHS)

I watched this movie without reading the 1971 Dame Agatha Christie novel that it was based on.  (Christie wrote twelve full-length Miss Marple murder mysteries.)  I'm glad I did this!  Why?  Because it forced me to really watch this movie in order to try and deduce who the murderer was.

The movie begins with millionaire Jason Rafiel (Frank Gatliff) dying of natural causes.  Soon after his death, Miss Marple (the late Joan Hickson) receives a letter written by the now dead Rafiel (who was her friend) asking her to do some investigation.  Miss Marple questions and comments after reading this letter:

""What kind of crime, if it was a crime, was it?  When [was it] committed - where - anything?  I'm most bewildered.  It's like being asked to do a crossword puzzle without any clues!""

Miss Marple eventually, with the aid of her godson Lionel (Peter Tilbury) begins slowly collecting information, the most interesting being the mysterious death of two young girls named Verity Hunt and Nora Brent.  However, Miss Marple is not sure of herself in her investigation and admits the following:

""Mr. Rafiel is a ghostly puppet master...laughing at [me] from beyond the grave.""

Eventually a murder and suicide occur.

Who are the people associated with this intriguing mystery?  They are as follows:

(1) Michael Rafiel, Jason's son (Bruce Payne)
(2) Mr. Broadribb, Jason's lawyer (Roger Hammond)
(3) Mr. Shuster, another of Jason's lawyers (Pat Godfrey)
(4) Miss Temple, retired school head mistress (Helen Cherry)
(5) Professor (of criminal psychology) Waustead (John Horsley)
(6) Miss Cooke, bodyguard (Jane Booker)
(7) Miss Barrow, bodyguard  (Alison Skilbeck)
(8) Clothilde Bradbury-Scott, the past guardian of Verity Hunt (Margaret Tyzack)
(9) Anthea, Clothilde's sister and another guardian of Verity (Anna Chopper)
(10) Lavina, a married sister of Clothilde (Valerie Lush)
(11) Mrs. Brent, mother of Nora (Liz Fraser)
(12) Archdeacon Brabazon (Peter Copley)

Joan Hickson (whom Agatha Christie herself wanted to play Miss Marple) captures the essence of the heroine super sleuth in her performance. (Hickson was 81 years old in this movie!).  Other fine performances to look for are Bruce Payne as Rafiel's son and Margaret Tyzack as Clothilde.

The character Jason Rafiel also appears in the Miss Marple murder mystery ""A Caribbean Mystery"" (1965).

Finally, the cinematography of this movie is well done.  All costumes and props are authentic looking.  The background music adds to each scene.

In conclusion, this is a fun and intriguing movie even if you have read the novel it's based on!!

637716,5,6303404855,"Step back into Britain of the 1950s. WWII is over and this is your opportunity to enjoy a vanished world of vintage buses, cars and trains. Carry your leather suitcase into the vine covered cottage, or visit your old school chum in her palatial mansion. Observe the Vicar and his wife on their bicycles. Visit the Norman Church for Evensong and note original frescos installed during the Middle Ages. If you're free for a holiday, take a motorcoach trip and visit Blenheim and Stourton. Dine at a first class hotel in London where the waiters wear white gloves or have tea and cakes with Miss Jane Marple--she might even offer you a glass of elderberry wine.
Miss Marple is a noticing kind of elderly woman who lives in the Village of Saint Mary Mead. Occasionally she travels hither and thither to visit friends or take advantage of a lovely trip planned by a nephew. She always has her knitting needles in hand, working on a baby blanket or a sweater for a nephew. Jane Marple--Godmother and Aunt to several young people--I wish I had known her personally--but this is the next best thing after the books. ""There she goes, tail up and head down"" on the trail of another murderer--and she will get her man or woman as the case may be.
I agree with the reviewer who said one doesn't buy these DVDs with the expectation of Criterion remastering. Even so, the quality of the films on these DVDs is pretty darn good. I collect Criterion DVDs and expect them to be the fully restored works of art they are. However, some of the films Criterion has restored were so badly damaged they are NOT better than the Miss Marple films even when Criterion has done it's best. Also, many of the Criterion films are Black and White films from the 1930s and 1940s and of interest because of their filmography and/or the innovative techniques their directors employed. Some of these films were shot on a shoestring budget and it shows. Technology has improved dramatically since the 40s. The reason I buy the older Criterion films is to see how clever directors worked around technological constraints.
Call me blind, but I think the quality of the Miss Marple tv films is pretty good. Although some outdoor scenes are faded in spots (the films were shot in color) the director had access to camerawork not available in the 40s. Also, these scripts are excellent and filled with interesting detail. Most Criterion films average 1-2 hours of playing time (not counting the ""perks"" which you may or may not be interested in) whereas Series 2 of the Miss Marple films offers the viewer 500 wonderful minutes.
I am grateful that I have access to DVD copies of the Miss Marple stories, and I can watch them any time I want to. When I am watching them, I am reminded of life in the days when I was a young girl. Plus, today's tv entertainment is pretty much directed to the younger set whereas the Miss Marple films are probably better appreciated by older folks like me who lived through the forties and fifties--or younger folks who wish they had.
The British actors in the BBC productions are consumate professionals. Joan Hickson was told by Agatha Chistie that she thought Hickson was the BEST Miss Marple ever! Incidentally, I believe Ms. Hickson appears in the Criterion version of THE LADY VANISHES and I know she is in one of the Margaret Rutherford films. If you've read Christie's novels, you know Hickson fits the description of Miss Marple far better than Margaret Rutherford. Christie described Miss Marple as tall and thin with fine white hair and twinkly blue eyes--a gentle person in a cardigan sweater carrying a bag with her knitting needles and latest project--not an agressive broad in a tweed suit. Many other fine British actors are featured in these films--Joss Ackland, Claire Bloom, Rosemary Crutchly all favorites of mine who can out perform the ""mega"" stars any day of the week.
I love the vintage settings, costumes, clothing, china, knick-knacks and bric-a-brac, jewelry, shoes, hats, handbags, luggage, handkerchiefs--nothing is missing. I still own a handkerchief sachet with hand embroidered handkerchiefs my grandmother made --and one makes a very important appearance in a Miss Marple tale. The BBC maintains a museum in Stratford on Avon where one can view the costumes and other props used in various productions. The Miss Marple films give me a vicarious thrill and a trip down memory lane. Tea anyone??",1016064000,172,4417,4.790301441677588
637717,4,6303404855,"I am writing more in response to the reviews that refer to the quality of these DVD's or, rather, the lack thereof.  I have to agree that these DVD's do not live up to anything Criterion puts out (no company does it better) but, on the other hand, I don't expect it to be that quality for the price paid.  Also, these originally were filmed in that late 1980's and I would doubt that the original negatives were retained for recording purposes some 16 years later.
I buy them because I love the character of Miss Marple and especially the quality performance of Joan Hickson.
Further, comparing Hickson's performance of Miss Marple with Ms. Rutherford's (these were MGM British production in the mid-1960's and were made to be campy and funny--remember at least one of the movies made was originally an Hercule Poirot story) is like comparing Lord Laurence Olivier's portrayal of Henry V to something that John Cleese might do (heaven forbid!).
So, take the quality as they are, relax and enjoy.  If you want true digital quality, we must purchase anything that is produced from the original negative rather than a positive copied, and from a true, reputable producer of DVDs ...",1015027200,54,1179,4.769607843137255
637718,3,6303404855,"I know that technically I am wrong on every count.  Joan Hickson is far closer to the character from the books than was Margaret Rutherford.  The T.V. series stuck far more closely to the plots of the books and the style of the books than did the MGM films.  And I know that, although they became great friends, Agatha Christie detested the films and thought Rutherford totally wrong for the part.
Nevertheless, Margaret Rutherford had such charm and was clearly such an eccentric (as well as being an excellent character actress,) that I far prefer the generally maligned film series.  To top it off, Ron Goodwin's soundtracks were terrific.  It would be nice to see them on CD.  (Fat chance.)
By all means, perpetuate the series via DVD, but PLEASE, MGM or Ted Turner or whoever currently holds the rights, issue the Rutherford films on DVD as well.
The less said the better, however, about MGM's ill-conceived, ill-fated attempt to launch an Hercule Poirot franchise with Tony Randall.  And I LIKE Tony Randall.  I loved him in The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao, which, through some uncharacteristic burst of good taste, IS on DVD and which should be purchased forthwith.  When they actually manage to put out a deserving film, it is our responsibility to support the effort by buying it.  The book (The Circus of Dr. Lao) is 20 times better than the movie and should still be in print.
One more thing and then I will shut up.  If you are a Margaret Rutherford fan, I strongly reccommend Mouse on the Moon.  Granted, Peter Sellers is AWOL, but ya got yer Margaret, ya got yer Terry Thomas, yer Ron Moody, Bernard Cribbens, John Le Mesurier, etc.  Ya got yer Richard Lester directing.  Could the director of HELP do anything wrong?  (Not much chance of The Bed-Sitting Room being issued on DVD, I suppose, is there?)",1013731200,10,1807,4.65615141955836

But once you (if you were so attracted to this character--perhaps a good pivotal point in the movie) do spot this character, rather an homeless person, wearing ragged clothes and with only his loyal pooch to go with him in his travels,  you're intrigued by why such an obviously ""well-born"" person could be without hearth and home surrounded by adoring family.

Everything that could be perfect comes together in this story: the acting, the setting, the plot, there is hardly a false note!  Hickson is and always will be THE definitive Miss Marple: she is the epitome of prim, quiet Victorian spinsterhood whose razor-sharp view of the world has been honed (ironically) by a lifetime in a village in the heart of England.  Every actor brings their own weight to each role, hardly anyone feels like an unnecessary character, from Miss Marple's tag-along nephew Lionel, to the seen-better-days trio of Bradbury-Scott sisters.

Who did I like the best? Easier answer was who I liked the least (McEwan). I'd probably say McKenzie's my favorite, but Joan Hickson is a very close second.

One person mentioned horrid production in this series. I'll admit the Acorn versions seemed a little more polished. However, if you're a cozy-mystery-holic like myself, you'll find these a nice evening's relaxing experience.

""Murder at the Vicarage""

Aunt Jane sees it all

Before we start the review if you want to see a scene from ""Murder at the Vicarage"" it is on the front cover of ""Miss Marple: A Pocketful of Rye"" (1987). If you want to see some scenes from ""Miss Marple: They Do it with Mirrors"" (1986), look on the back cover of this film sheath. If this sounds mixes up, imaging the viewer trying to make sense of the pictures.

""Murder at the Vicarage"" starts out with important information scenes and a missing one pound note. As Reverend Leonard Clement (Paul Eddington) passes the hedge hiding Miss Jane Marple (Joan Hickson), he expresses an ill chosen explicative to describe Colonel Lucius Protheroe (Robert Lang).

Yep, there is a murder at the vicarage, which is conveniently located in plain sight of Miss Marple. Everyone has a motive and nobody had opportunity.  You and Detective Inspector Slack (David Horovitch) must sort through all the sub plots and confessions to find out what happened.

Jason Rafiel's last wish

Millionaire Jason Rafiel of whom we met in a previous movie ""A Caribbean Mystery"" (1989) leaves a last wish before he dies. He wants Miss Marple of whom he calls his Nemesis, to look into the accusation that his son murdered a girl. Jason leaves Jane Marple a considerable sum of money, and a bus ticket regardless of what she finds.

The dcor of the investigation is marvelous: a tour to homes and gardens in England and it starts beautifully with Blenheim Palace and ends around Abbey Ducis where the whole business started. She sure is both under narrow surveillance from the Home Office and well protected by several guardian angels even if seriously in danger from the real criminal. But it will take her some real stamina to face the situation and confound the culprit with the crime, while her nephew will be running after the son of that millionaire practicing his repentance with London's homeless people. That too is marvelously done: showing what England was in the mid-1950s. Quite an interesting adaptation with such a nice actress knitting in the corner of the drawing room of some hotel.

The last has become quite important to me over the years; I mean by it the minimization of actual violence, the emphasis on character and story, not on split second action, and very real heroes and villains diluted by touches of humanity in each case.
Obviously, these are personal judgments not value neutral standards. Those who seek more current models for detective/mystery/thriller fare will quite reasonably find more than a little boredom in Marple and Poirot. So be it. Trying to be everything to everyone produces indigestible trash.",1219017600,,1163,4.849246231155779

7845300,5,6303404855,"This 1987 PBS ""Mystery!"" production of ""Nemesis"" is based on Agatha Christie's 1971 novel of the same name, the last Miss Marple novel that Christie wrote. It stars Joan Hickson as the shrewd, busybody, spinster sleuth who is always a few steps ahead of everyone else in understanding human behavior. This story has an unusual structure, as the nature of the mystery is unknown to Miss Marple when she begins her investigation. Upon the death of Mr. Jason Rafiel (Frank Gatliff), a wealthy invalid with whom she was acquainted, Miss Marple receives a letter from Rafiel's solicitors. Mr. Rafiel requested that Miss Marple investigate a mystery in order that justice be done but did not say what the mystery is. He said only that she would be paid the sum of 20,000 upon its solution, and he left her two tickets for a bus tour of ""Historic Homes and Gardens."" Intrigued, Miss Marple joins the bus tour, accompanied by her recently divorced godson Lionel Peel (Peter Tilbury).

Miss Marple asks Mr. Rafiel's solicitors to send her any information they can about Mr. Rafiel's son and heir, Michael (Bruce Payne), who was estranged from his father and missing since being accused of murdering a young woman, Verity Hunt, some years before. Miss Marple finds her fellow tourists unusually distinguished and mysterious. The clean-cut Elizabeth Temple (Helen Cherry) is a headmistress. There is an expert on criminal psychology who works for the Home Office, Professor Wanstead (John Horsley). Two chummy young women, Miss Cooke (Jane Booker) and Miss Barrow (Alison Skilbeck), are following Miss Marple. They are all corralled by a harried tour guide named Madge (Joanna Hole). When the tour reaches the town of Abbey Ducis, another acquaintance of Mr. Rafiel's, Lavinia Glynne (Valerie Lush), invites Miss Marple to stay the night at the old manor house she shares with sisters Clothilde (Margaret Tyzack) and Anthea (Anna Cropper).

I found ""Nemesis"" more satisfying than typical ""Mystery!"" fare. Joan Hickson was always excellent as Miss Marple. She conveyed far more personality and intelligence than other actresses who have played the part. But this mystery, which leaves us all wondering what the mystery is for quite some time, works particularly well. Everything is not obvious, not to Miss Marple nor to the audience. To leave the audience wondering what, if anything, is going to happen is a more effective hook than beginning with a crime. I don't think that the film follows the book in every respect, but T.R. Bowen did a good job with the adaptation, retaining the intriguing supporting characters. The film runs about 1 hour 45 minutes. The A&E discs do not have particularly good transfers, unfortunately. I wish these classic Christie adaptations would be restored, but I don't know if they were shot on film or video. ""Nemesis"" was what Mr. Rafiel ominously called Miss Marple, by the way.",1425600000,,2903,5.045833333333333
