1883949,3,B00009L4S8,Didn't the Uconn Huskies beat Syracuse more than once in 2003?  Great video for a 2nd place Big East team.  Also I believe the orange bowed out in the 1st round in 2005.  How's Jimmy B doing now?,1155427200,,195,4.078947368421052
1883950,2,B00009L4S8,"I bought the DVD expecting a nice overview of the final four leading incl. the victory of Syracuse. Where I live, Amsterdam (The Netherlands, Europe) I wasn't able to see the games. I think the DVD is great for big Syracuse fans, but not for the general basketball fan... The quality of editing is also not what you expect in the 21st century...",1086048000,3,345,4.492063492063492
1883951,4,B00009L4S8,"This dvd is a must-have if you are a Carmelo Anthony fan. His performance, during his freshman season no less, is one for the ages. Never again will an 18 year old that is still ""wet behind the ears"" dominate so convincingly. It's definitely a sign for things to come for Carmelo and the Nugget organization alike. From his first game at Madison Square Garden, to the Final Four tournament, the dvd gives a strong document of the on-court happenings. It could've been a 5-star rating, if it showed more ""behind the scenes"" shots. For example, the dvd never stated the ""One More Year"" campaign started by Syracuse students in an attempt to bring back Anthony for one more season. Nonetheless, it should be a prized possession for Syracuse students, allumni, residents, and fans. Especially the ones who expected victory 15 years ago with the NBA roster filled 87-88 squad with Derrick Coleman, Rony Seikaly, Billy Owens, and Sherman Douglas.",1059609600,4,940,4.88125
1883952,4,B00009L4S8,"I like the quality of the pictures but I felt they cut a little too much of the commentary from the game.  It would've been nice to have an alternate audio track with the radio guys doing play-by-play.  And it should've included the One Shining Moment montage at the end.
Still (and I stress this) this is a MUST HAVE for all Syracuse Orangemen fans!",1054857600,5,350,4.369230769230769
1883953,5,B00009L4S8,Words can't describe it.  It's so great to be able to watch this game again every single day without any commercials and no time outs.  You can call your own time outs with the pause button to go get another beer if you don't have your own beer wench at home.,1054857600,4,259,4.0588235294117645
7991265,5,B00009L4S8,"As a diehard Syracuse fan, times have gotten tough the last few years. But I pop this into the DVD player and relive the past! Makes me feel good! Dreaming of another march run this year! Go Cuse!",1518134400,,196,4.184210526315789

7991267,5,B00009L4S8,"Being that Syracuse's only NCAA Basketball championship was in 2003, this DVD is a must-have to relive the dream season.",1388016000,,120,5.05
7991268,5,B00009L4S8,If you love melo and/or the orangemen then you will love this championship run video.  Definitely worth buying if you are a cuse fan.,1376956800,,133,4.541666666666667
7991269,5,B00009L4S8,This DVD had it all.  The full live video of the game is great to relive.  Plus the dvd had highlights from all the various other games in the 2003 tourney.,1374451200,,156,4.0
7991270,5,B00009L4S8,I ordered a special edition DVD for an additional price but received the same standard DVD that I bought years ago.,1367280000,,115,4.523809523809524
7991271,5,B00009L4S8,"I mean, what else is there to say, I think my title speaks for itself and frankly...so does the DVD :)",1315353600,,102,3.9047619047619047
7991272,5,B00009L4S8,"I get chills every time I watch this DVD.  G-Mac hitting those 3s, Warrick's block, and 'Melo smiling down the court makes this worth watching over and over again!!!!",1300406400,,166,4.724137931034483
7991273,5,B00009L4S8,"If you're a Syracuse fan you definitely should buy this item.  Especially given the way the team has played recently it was very therapeutic.

So far I've only watched the replay of the championship game (not the other portion which I guess shows other tourney games), but it would be worth the money just for the final game.",1210550400,,325,4.586206896551724
7991274,5,B00009L4S8,"as a central new york native (clinton, ny to be specific) this dvd couldn't help but bring back the great memories of the syracuse orange 2003 championship season.  i thoroughly enjoyed watching this and reliving all the great moments of melo, g-mac and my man kueth duanay!  if you are a syracuse orange fan, this is a must buy for you!",1168300800,2,337,4.508196721311475
