8156037,4,B000KF0NPM,"Please note that I recommend watching Finus' videos in addition to your regular ballet classes in a classroom. His videos are not meant for leisure or your workout at home. It is a series of detailed and fundamental teachings that focus on things that your ballet teacher may not have time to explain in the classroom. It is for people who are serious in getting better at classical ballet techniques. For pointe work, those complain who need more tips, unfortunately there is not much except for hard work. The fundamental exercises need to be practiced repetitiously and regularly for someone to get better. With this said, I do think Finus' videos are a rare find in the market place and that he is willing to share the detailed knowledge that is not taught in many ballet classes. The only suggestion I would give is that the videos can be slightly longer with more commentaries provided / pointed out after the dancers finish each exercise.",1504224000,,945,4.7682926829268295

8156039,5,B000KF0NPM,"I've been studying ballet for three years, as and adult beginner. I take classes three times a week, and I've added two days of ""Finis"" to my schedule. His DVDs are as good as a ballet class, I love the way he explains the moves, then has a professional dancer demonstrate each section. I find the level three DVDs just right for me, challenging, but not impossible. I'm looking forward to moving into Level 4.",1457049600,,410,4.48

8156041,1,B000KF0NPM,"Your DVD which is advertised and marketed as The Art of Pointework did not meet my need to view a pointe barre and class.  I threw it in the trash and wasted 55 hard earned dollars.  I would not on any condition recommend this DVD.
Unhappy Amazon Customer.",1435968000,,256,4.3125
8156042,1,B000KF0NPM,this dvd shows a bit of technical information but its very limited and too much repetition of the same performance skills,1401494400,,121,4.809523809523809
8156043,5,B000KF0NPM,"This is an extremely effective teaching video for people attempting to master pointework.  It starts with exercises for gracefully walking and running on 3/4 toe in pointe shoes, and progresses to a series of basic centerwork combinations aimed at helping the dancer to develop strong, clean footwork technique.  What makes this DVD so unique and so helpful to the student, however, is the quality of the instruction that Mr. Finis Jhung provides.  Each exercise is thoroughly explained with the aid of close-ups, slow-motions, freeze frames, and voice-overs, during which he points out precisely what should be done, and calls attention to common mistakes that make it impossible to do the exercises correctly.  The music, by Scott Killian, is wonderful, and the exercises are expertly demonstrated by the lovely Michele Wiles of ABT.  In all, this video is a precious gem among instructional DVD's, and viewers who study its contents are bound to improve their ballet skills.",1222473600,7,977,5.237179487179487
