7955969,5,B00005V4XY,"I'm a big fan of Johnny Young Bosch's. I wasn't sure about buying this movie, but I thought it was very good.",1374364800,,109,4.0
7955970,4,B00005V4XY,"""Extreme Heist"" (AKA ""Wicked Game"") is the first attempt of the Alpha Stunts team at a self-made production that had nothing to do the ""Power Rangers"" franchise. The movie is a miniature marvel of no-frills stuntwork and martial arts action that fell prey to obscurity thanks to a pretty boring VHS/DVD cover and the fact that serious action fans seem to equate anything related to the Power Rangers as kids' stuff. However, director/coordinator Koichi Sakamoto and his disciples are anything but amateurs and leading man Johnny Yong Bosch is most definitely more than just an ex-Ranger. The low-budget production is sure to alienate some folks, but in experience, this is one of the few films that saved itself from a mediocre rating almost entirely by the quality of its action scenes.

The story: when high-stakes thieves Billy Ray Leung (Bosch,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Broken-Path/dp/B003KK5AOI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Broken Path</a>) and Guile Lydon (Jason ""Skull"" Narvy) steal a book containing the access to codes to accounts containing millions of stolen dollars, they become the targets of vicious bank robbers.

Let's get it out of the way: the movie doesn't look very good, aesthetically. Though the filmmakers obviously tried to maintain a high standard with their second-class cameras, everything still has that vague home-shot feel to it, making you think at first that this is going to be an extended demo video and not an actual movie. Additionally, the film co-stars stuntwoman Motoko Nagina as an undercover FBI agent tailing our heroes, and while her martial offerings are nice, she's a pretty bad actress, partially due to her unfamiliarity with the English language. I was also sort of displeased with the casting of George Cheung (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rambo-First-Blood-Part-2/dp/B0004Z33EQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rambo: First Blood, Part 2</a>) as a main villain: though this is one of the few films wherein he actually fights, it's a pretty lackluster role and I'm sure that George just took it because the filmmakers flashed some money his way. With that said, I was surprised at how adept Johnny Yong is as a leading man: some of his humorous dialogue is forced and he's sporting a truly dreadful hairstyle, but he's clearly having fun with the role without dropping professionalism.

Then again, however good of an actor he is, it's nothing compared to how good of an action hero he is. It's particularly ironic these days to hear western fans gush over Scott Adkins when they technically had someone much closer to home performing much of the same stuff years earlier. Admittedly, Bosch hasn't done nearly enough live-action work to sate an initiated fan, but man o man is it worth picking up ""Extreme Heist"" just to see him cut loose. Staying off the wires, Johnny kicks, flips, and takes a fall with undeniable talent and grace throughout his five fights, performing what looks like the majority of his own stunts even when those include being thrown off the hood of a speeding car or running at top speed down a steep cliffside. Of course, the Alpha Stunts team deserves credit not only for coordinating these feats but also for supplying the many thugs and bad guys to take the equally impressive falls. Getting hit full-force by a car seems like nothing to these folks, and ""Extreme Heist"" sets some kind of a record for truly cringe-inducing instances of performers falling flat on the back of their necks. During the whole show, I only noticed a single support wire - pretty impressive. Lead enforcer Michael Hexum isn't nearly as big on taking the falls but shows enough physical talent to make me wish that he had done more work like this in his career.

I'm not a fan of the animated gunfire present throughout the movie, the second half of which is definitely better than the first. Maybe I'm being a bit generous with my four-star rating, but not by much: the amount of talent being displayed here is universally recognizable and infinitely superior to both Hollywood and low-budget material in general. It's a shame that Bosch chose to pursue a career in cartoon voice-acting rather than become an early Tony Jaa - he definitely could've pulled it off, even when working with the bare essentials.",1329091200,,4345,5.202857142857143
7955971,5,B00005V4XY,"Though the picture is a little grainy, and sound is a tad uneven, the movie itself is great! Though, you have to have an appreciation for such things. Loads of violence (all the stunts are real, by the way) and some cussing. Though, the most Johnny Bosch says is ""hell,"" but others say worse. Besides the cool action and tight setting, it's a really s one of those things where you have to pay attention to the entire movie, or else you'll miss something that might come up later on. Not only does it have action and a good plot, there's comedy too. The two thieves (Billy Ray and Guile) have a little trademark that is sort of corny, but it's really cool. Just beware, there are a ton of cliches and corny phrases.
Other than the aforementioned faults (which there are few of), this movie is great for any original Power Rangers' fan or any martial arts fan!! Also for those who like movies about thieves on a mission!!",1017273600,2,920,4.41764705882353
7955972,3,B00005V4XY,"this is a really good movie....plot wise anyway. the editing was pretty bad though. some of the shots look they were filmed with a home video camera. there is some dubbing done on speaking parts that is really noticable. other than that, the movie is great. lots of martial arts action and some funny one-liners.",1016668800,,312,4.6909090909090905
7955973,1,B00005V4XY,"The reason why I gave the DVD a 1 star is because I don't think the releasing company didn't even take the time to even remaster the soundtrack! The picture quality looks old, grainy and weathered, the image is distorted and the colors are uneven. The sound-quality is a Dolby Digital 2.0 track, and it sounds like snakes hissing at the screen, but I don't see any snakes. The movie isn't even in Widescreen Presentation it's in the lousy Fullscreen Version.
Overall Grade:
Picture: NO STARS
Sound: NO STARS
Movie: *** out of *****
In case you're wondering this movie stars two of the cast members from the original Power Rangers show! Watch only if you can stand the terrible picture and sound.",1015545600,2,695,4.658536585365853
