8266864,5,B0017PPGAG,"As a transplanted Californian, I have really missed the state that will always be home to me.  Fortunately, Huell Howser did a wonderful series called ""California Gold"".  He died a few years back, but his work will live on.  I just bought ""Road Trip"" Big Bear Lake; it arrived in great shape and played just fine. I know any ""California Gold"" episode will be well worth buying.",1378512000,,377,4.597014925373134
