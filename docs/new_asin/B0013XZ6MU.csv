Breath taking Michele Mercier, she is just perfectly gorgeous in this role; wich did ruined her acting cariere, people will only want to see her and remember her as Angelique. More than a treat for us, it will take you with her in her world...i just hope that the english dubbing is good, translation and voices, the french version is so beautiful that i'm a little ""afraid"" that it doesn't do to well, but will never know. I'm buying it for my 2 daughters, they saw the french version and do not understand french so I had to translate every sentences, so now they are very excited to see it in their native English. They are tell me we can't wait to see it and to finally enjoy every minute of the movies...",1208995200,8,884,4.396341463414634
3120576,5,B0013XZ6MU,"Hello to all of you globally who support the memory of Anglique - I'm reproducing my amazon.co.uk review where I have also posted images - please visit and see the recent and past photos of the author, now sadly widowed and completing her series by not only writing but also researching the background.

Where can one begin a review of this iconic heroine and do her and her creators justice? I seem to have known or been involved with Anglique throughout my adult life - I read the first book when I should have been studying for my A-Levels! My sister introduced me to the books - she felt I should have outgrown my beloved Jean Plaidy and Chalet School books by that age and moved onto something a little more sophisticated - she chose Anglique for me - and what a choice! I have written reviews for these books on Amazons fabulous review facility and according to the statistics they have proved useful to several readers. I hope I may have encouraged others to seek out the now sadly out of print versions, many of which are commanding obscene amounts of money on ebay probably due to being erroneously described as erotic - shame the sellers don't read their books first!
But to the films - I saw the first film - Marquise of the Angels on BBC2 with English sub-titles - I can't remember much of that other than I was so terribly excited that the books had been transferred to film and Michele Mercier did look gorgeous - seemingly Brigitte Bardot and Jane Fonda had turned down the opportunity to become the eponymous heroine. Considering BBs love for animals and political acumen, she might have paid closer attention to Angliques life which mirrors these two avenues. I digress - a failing of mine. I discovered the second film in Zakopane in the Tatra Mountains of Poland where I was on holiday with a friend of Julie Christie's - yes honestly. We were out for a stroll when we saw the weather front hurtling towards us and dived into the nearest building which happened to be a cinema coincidentally showing the film - it was dubbed into Polish with English subtitles - I loved that film to pieces, especially the visual affect of the Court of Miracles and then the complete contrast as Anglique is presented to the Sun King himself by her cousin Phillipe. As an aside just as I did not discover the existence of three more books in the series until the mid-80s [still unpublished in English despite world-wide interest], so I did not realise that there were 5 Anglique films - those I discovered when I started visiting Paris in the 90s.
It has to be said that the films are visually stunning, the music score beautiful and haunting and the fact that they are now going to be available with English sub-titles is why I am going to buy my third set of DVDs - all the others are PAL SECAM playable over here but with no sub-title facility. I've enjoyed these films because they are entertaining - the characters share the same names as the characters in the books - but the storylines differ to suit the needs of the time - this is no bad thing because thanks to the films the legend lives on and Anne Golon is not forgotten. There is agreement that Desgrez [a real historical character] is portrayed as the most believable and best cast - but we perhaps forget that this is a French invention and will be viewed differently than something like the Onedin Line which is a wholly British invention [with an Anglique-like character in the form of Jessica Benton as James' sister Elizabeth].
There are some superbly innovative ideas in the films and it has a ""happy ever after"" ending which is a shame because the story does continue in the New World and could have created a whole second tranche of films.
It's fun,it's not serious, it's pretty to look at - see the films, then read the books!",1205107200,17,3801,4.532751091703057
3120577,5,B0013XZ6MU,"As Eric Glasby urges anyone to buy this box set just to have these ""Classics"" in your home Library, I agree whole heartily; for Angelique is indeed a ""Classic"". Like the movies lovers who have viewed this Classic in tandem and have received hours of pleasure so have the readers of Angelique. The Angelique books proved an international success of gigantic proportions. Estimates of the total number of Angelique books sold worldwide are upwards of 150 million, and they have been translated and published in at least 63 countries, by at least 320 different publishers, in over 20 different languages. Given these numbers, there are only a small percentage of readers who are aware there is indeed an end to the series of Angelique. There are 3 more volumes that have never been translated and Anne Golon is striving to finish the end to Angelique's journey. There are millions of people that have read the Angelique series who are unaware that the story continues let alone they have been deprived of the knowing the story in its full context.
 I urge anyone to visit: FriendsofAngelique@yahoogroups.com  and  [...] to learn the ""rest of the story"".
Happy Viewing, take the plunge. To quote Joffrey de Peyrac, as he and Angelique sailed to the shore of Quebec ""Let the Journey begin"".",1204761600,31,1285,4.885321100917431
3120578,5,B0013XZ6MU,"The original fifteen or so written novels about the Courtesan Angelique were incredibly popular worldwide in the Fifties and Sixties and the series of five motion pictures were produced in the late 1960's as a joint French-Italian-German collaboration. - The huge input of talent,  budget and production values oozes off the screen. No Computer gimmicks here - just sheer gloss, action and pleasure.
I purchased the French Box Set from Amazon UK some time back and the five films were beautifully presented in original DyaliScope (CinemaScope) with restored color and French language. All five Trailers were also included.
My five taped-off-TV in the late Seventies VHS copies still play well and are still very watchable (and in English language) but were naturally only standard screen cut-downs.
If a further updated set is not in Widescreen then why bother? The French Set is worth Ten Stars and the vision supersedes any problems with not understanding the dialogue!
However, for those who have never seen these five brilliant and extremely entertaining movies, I urge anyone to buy this Box Set just to have these Classics in your Home Library.
And yes, the haunting Music Score by Michel Magne is truly wonderful - I was lucky to obtain the overseas pressing of the priceless LP at a Collectibles Fair a few years ago.
These five movies are Gems and have given me many repeated hours of pleasure over the years since 1978 both on VHS and the recent French DVD copies - several times the five have been watched in tandem - they are that entertaining.
And Michelle Mercier - a truly beautiful Actress from the late Sixties era when the films were made, who was ideally cast in the title role. Her husband is played by Robert Hussein who gives an equally lifelike performance in all five films.
My favourite is ANGELIQUE AND THE SULTAN.

3120595,4,B0013XZ6MU,"STUNNING COSTUMES AND CASTLES WITH A FAIRLY GOOD PLOT BASED ON A POPULAR NOVEL SERIES

WARNING: FANS OF THE 1964 FILMS OR THE NOVELS MAY HAVE PRECONCEPTIONS THAT MAKE THIS VERSION MORE DIFFICULT TO ENJOY -- IF WATCHED AS A COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT WORK, YOU MAY FIND IT VERY ENTERTAINING  (see more notes on this below)

INTRO:  This stunning period adventure has a little feel of Alexandre Dumas with some hints of Leprince de Beaumont (Beauty and the Beast) thrown in. It is gorgeously filmed and well acted (though some in France didn't like the casting).  Despite the overtones of Beauty and the Beast I mentioned (Angelique has to adjust to the less attractive Peyrac), this tale is blended with a much broader adventure story worthy of romance adventures past.  Though there is a nice romance at the center of this tale, there is plenty of sword play and tons of court intrigue as well. It's based on the novel series by Anne and Serge Golon.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  Beautiful and independent Angelique has been betrothed to the wealthy Count de Peyrac in order to restore her family's strained financial situation.  It is said he is disfigured and unattractive despite his grand wealth and ancient name.  Angelique goes reluctantly to her new life and informs Peyrac that she is her own woman.  To her surprise, Peyrac is quite intelligent and progressive. He has no intention of forcing her into a physical relationship though he is smitten by her wild beauty and independent nature.  Part of Peyrac's wealth comes from his mine and ability to separate the gold using a technique not known in France.  This makes him a target of jealousy for other nobles, the inquisition based in Toulouse (the same region of his holdings), and even the king himself.  As their relationship develops, powerful forces are moving against them.  However, Angelique unwittingly becomes the real target as a terrible secret comes to light.  Through a series of events, it becomes known that Angelique was witness to a plot to kill King Louis IVX when she was a young girl.  Further, she stole papers from the plotters which hold their names.  Young Angelique had to hide the papers before being caught, so she did not see who the plotters were.  They also did not know who she was until she tells the story to a confessor and is unknowingly betrayed.  The rest of the tale is a process of discovery and tenderness between the Count and Countess de Peyrac, and the conflict that is forming to destroy them.

WHY SOME VIEWERS DIDN'T LIKE IT:  This movie was not well received by the French public and critiques alike.  However, the reasons are those that may not affect many American viewers.  The movie has far too short of a run time to be very faithful to the novels.  Also, there was a movie series beginning in 1964&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angelique-Collection/dp/B0013XZ6MU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angelique Collection</a>&nbsp;which was very well beloved and created many preconceptions of what each character should be like.  This movie did not match those expectations despite competent and popular actors.  Peyrac is also quite a bit older in this version where in the books I believe he was around 27.  However, his age (maybe mid to late 40's) in this version suits his level of education and experience.  The movie also skips from one stage to the next with not quite enough connection or story construction.  It cold have used a little more development.

FINAL THOUGHTS:  Despite the nit picks here and there, this is still a terrific story with gorgeous cinematography and costumes.  One of my favorite little castles was used in the filming though it's actually in Belgium (Chateau de Beloeil).  The castle used for Peyrac was also just plain gorgeous!  If one can accept the sometimes unceremonious scene changes and lack of comparability to book and original film, this is still an excellent period adventure.  The romance at times is actually on the edge of eroticism and there is a fairly sensual love scene.  This would generally fit an R rating.  Nora Arnezeder is stunning and does a terrific job of projecting the intelligence and willfulness of Angelique.  Again, I won't give anything away, but realize this movie only covers part of a much greater story of Angelique.  There is absolutely closure given at the end so you don't have to worry about that, but it may not be exactly what one expects.  If this movie interests you, I suggest watching before going back to the 1964 movies or reading the books.",1421971200,9,4570,4.9526938239159

The films? Although hated by the critics, they became instant classics with the public in Europe and made Michle Mercier the highest paid star in France for a few years. Since their initial release in 1964 - 1968, I have seen them many times and always love to see them again. This is vintage 1960s movie entertainment and much better than the 2013 remake of the first film that tried to bring Anglique to the You-Tube-genearation but failed.",1415750400,,598,4.598130841121495

3120606,5,B0013XZ6MU,"I have recently watched the movie ""Anglique"" by Ariel Zeitoun and must say that I liked it very, very much, more than I expected. Admittedly, the plot differed much from the book and for fans of Anne Golon, who expect a rendition true to the novel this might be a somewhat irritating aspect. If my opinion on this thing is concerned, I think that films are always adaptations and works of their own. But that's up to everybody's personal preferences, of course. Coming to the quality of the original script, I can't say here anything, because I have watched the film in a translated version.

The main strength of this production and people, who carry it on their shoulders, are the two magnificent main actors: Nora Arnezeder as Anglique and Grard Lanvin as her husband Joffrey de Peyrac.

To me Nora Arnezeder was the ideal choice for Anglique, she not only acted very naturally in this complex role and showed the character just like she was in the books by Anne Golon, as a strong, intelligent and independent young woman, but also looked exactly like I pictured Anglique when I read the books and had her aristocratic and fresh beauty. Coming to Grard Lanvin, I had, before watching the film, my doubts concerning his age (in the book Anglique is 17 and Joffrey 29 years old, whereas in the new movie Anglique's age remains unchanged, but Joffrey is forty years older than her), but from the moment I saw his performance my doubts completely disappeared. For he played the character with great sensitivity, charm and charisma and made Joffrey de Peyrac a true grand seigneur that this personage was in the novel.

Strangely enough, the big age difference between Anglique and Joffrey wasn't palpable at all and their love story very credible. I was indeed very surprised by this, for I thought that an age difference that big would be impossible to bridge, but Nora Arnezeder and Grard Lanvin have done the impossible.

Furthermore, there are in particular two very moving scenes, among quite many of that kind, where Nora Arnezeder and Grard Lanvin reach the height of acting skill: the scene where Joffrey is arrested and says goodbye to Anglique and the scene, in which Anglique visits Joffrey in the Bastille. These moments brought tears to my eyes and I have never experienced that before when watching a movie!

Also worth mentioning is the beautiful scene where Anglique and Joffrey make love for the first time. It was very sensual, but also full of tenderness and the viewer could feel the budding love between Anglique and Joffrey. Kudos to the director of photography, Peter Zeitlinger, to whom I will come later, who filmed that scene aesthetically and in good taste.

The nature of the relationship between Anglique and Joffrey progresses however differently than in the book, i.e. Anglique realizes only much later what her husband really means to her.

Coming to the visual side of the film, what is especially noteworthy to me is the fantastic photography by Peter Zeitlinger, shot almost entirely with the use of natural light!

The realistic sets, decorated with much dedication and attention to detail, and the costumes, in case of which the designers, Edith Vesperini and Stphane Rollot, worked with great care in regard to every single item of clothing, like corsets, stockings and chemises, caused that I felt like transplanted into the 17th century.

In my praise I would like mention the enchanting music by Nathaniel Mchaly, which added much to the atmosphere of the production and to which I could listen with great pleasure, even with no picture, only with headphones on.

To sum things up, I think ""Anglique"" is a beautiful, engaging and immensely romantic rendition of the ""Beauty and the Beast"" fairy tale motive. I'm holding fingers crossed for next parts and keep waiting for them impatiently!

3120610,5,B0013XZ6MU,"The 5 ""Angelique"" movies were very popular in the movie theaters all over Western Europe. That was in the mid to late 60's.
Only 2 other historical movies were as popular, the Austrian ""Sissi"" trilogy with Romy Schneider from the mid 50's and the old American film ""Forever Amber"" with Linda Darnell filmed in the 40's.

What I particularly enjoy in this third Angelique set (I had them on VHS in German some 35 years ago, then ordered another set from infrench.com after the millenium, before I finally bought them on DVD) is the excellent English dubbing.
Yes, no subtitles, but a perfect dubbing.
Trust me, I've watched the German dubbed Angelique movies countless times, I know the dialogues by heart. Unless there's a difference between the original French dialogue and the German dubbing, I can confirm that the English dubbing has the exact same text as the German dubbing. So you are no longer forced to watch these wonderful movies with annoying subtitles.

And once you've seen the movies, you might want to read all 9 Angelique books that so far have been translated into English, because two of the best sequels, ""Angelique, the Rebel"" and the follow up volume which brings Angelique to the New World, unfortunately have not been filmed.

BTW there just was an Angelique remake which was released in France around Christmas 2013. Hopefully it will be available on DVD in the US soon.

3120616,3,B0013XZ6MU,"Keep in mind that I watched with English-dubs (which seemed quite good and I hardly noticed BTW).  OK, the Movie starts with Angelique all grown up.  I can accept that the book set-up of Angelique's genteel poverty is avoided.  Much was accurate at first.  There was Angelique caught with Nicholas, her forced marriage to Jeoffry and seeing his mining endevors.

But the movie (as well done as it is) starts to depart from the books after that.  Gradually at first, then greater (according to my english book translations).  The movie version starts to become less faithful to the books.

Important scenes are left out.  Important scenes are diminished. But most importantly, to anyone who has read the books, Joeffry de Pyrec is revealed to Angelique WAY too early.  He finds her again in the Mediterranean as ""Rescator"" as 'Angelique In Barbary' when that NEVER happened in the books.  And Colin Paturnel was shot and killed at the ending.

Granted, it made a standard movie ending, but it was very shocking and disappointing to see the plot so ruined.

And then there was the casting.  Angelique is well cast.  Her more minor supporting characters are well cast, The detective and the poet and family were great.  But Joeffry was a little fop in the movie, completely unlike in the books. Granted, he did great work moving with his charachter's bad leg. but that was about it.

If you you want to admire the admirable Jeoffry de Peyrac, equal in every way to the outstanding Angelique of the books, you won't see it here.  And you won't see the tension on them both meeting finally in the real story a few books beyond this movie.

I'm not sure how to rate this movie.  On the one hand, I was glad of it and I generally enjoyed it.  I have learned to forgive failures of movies to follow great books.  But it really failed at the end by the books.

I have to give it a 3 at best and mostly because I love the books and are grateful there was even an attempt at a movie.

I'll give this a 3 for there just being a movie made of the first books, a 2 for casting Joeffrey de Peyrac badly, and a 2 for following the books badly.  But I still want to make it a 3 for just existing.

In spite of all, I enjoyed watching it.  Now I just want someome to do the books into a series of movies right the next time.",1375747200,5,2306,4.377358490566038

BUT, alas, these were better seen through the eyes of a young person back then.  For me they are only souvenirs of that era, but they aren't exactly classic movies.  Note: Michele Mercier became so popular through these movies (competing with Brigette Bardot at the time) that she could not get roles of other characters.  She documents this in auto-biographical books she has written (in French).

When I received them in Australia, the only way that I could watch them was on my husband's computer so I spent hours at his desk, sighing and loving them.

When buying a new Blue Ray, I took the movies with me and found only one Blue Ray that would play the American format.  I then re-watched all the Angeliques on a huge screen and loved them just as much.

However, I will never get tired of watching these wonderful movies, so I always had a VHS version, then later a DVD version from the German dubbed movies and now finally own the English dubbed version which BTW has exactly the same dialogue as in the French and German dubbing. So in case some people think they might miss out on some text and rather select the English subtitles, I can calm you down: the English dubbing is absolutely authentic and nothing is missing from the original dialogues.

For everybody who is into historical movies, I can also recommend ""Frenchman's Creek"" with Anthony Delon (the very good remake of the old film with Joan Fontaine, but this time filmed in Cornwall where the story takes place), ""Forever Amber"" and ""Dsire"" (Michael Rennie and Jean Simmons).",1315353600,3,932,4.717791411042945

I absolutely recommend these movies, expecially the first one: Anglique is a proto heroine, just before Diana Gabaldon's Outlander, but also the various Lara Croft, Sidney Bristow, Buffy and Xena. And Anglique is also the longest literary saga on the screen before Harry Potter's.
Just watch these movies, there are wonderful. I believe that Sissi movies are too much old style and not so good on a historical point of view. Anglique is much better!",1313625600,,532,4.731182795698925
3120658,4,B0013XZ6MU,"This review is only about the technology and its limitations.

This superb collection of movie gems has been remastered by Lion's Gate Films, and the picture is sharp and crisp and clear, as if it had just been filmed yesterday!

The format is WIDE SCREEN, not FULL SCREEN, as mentioned in previous reviews. We would have preferred the Full Screen format on our 32 inch TV set, but this is the original framing of these movies as they were filmed in the 60's.

There are 3 discs, not 5 as you would expect. Movie One is on DISC ONE side A (side B being empty); movies Two and Three on each side of DISC TWO; and movies Four and Five (being shorter) both fit on side A of DISC THREE. This is a bit confusing, an unusual combination, but all five films are accounted for.

There are no Special Features, no booklet or chapters guide, and the Audio sound is uneven: the French Audio (with subtitles) comes out loud and clear, but the English dubbed Audio is much lower and requires readjusting to be heard properly (thus the four star rating). Let's hope that in future releases, Lion's Gate can correct all these limitations.

Notwithstanding these limitations, this is an excellent collection of movie gems, to be enjoyed and treasured by all Angelique fans everywhere for years to come.",1310169600,2,1286,4.598253275109171

3120674,4,B0013XZ6MU,"Somewhere between the pomp and ceremony of the Romy Schneider ""Sissi"" trilogy, and a series of four Barbara Cartland telemovies in the late 1980's, there is ANGELIQUE.  Based on the bestselling book series written by Anne and Serge Golon, we follow Angelique (played by breathtaking French actress Michle Mercier) through several continents and five movies filled with adventure, bodice-ripping romance, and more than a dash of royal intrigue.

A sprawling saga covering many years and a great sweep of historical events, Angelique (Mercier) is a headstrong young girl, virtually ""sold"" into marriage to the much older Count Joffrey de Peyrac (""Love on a Pillow""'s Robert Hossein).  Covered in facial scars and walking with a limp, Angelique is horrified by her husband, but in true ""Beauty and the Beast"" fashion soon finds a compassionate heart underneath his less than thrilling exterior.  Their happiness is short-lived however, when Joffrey is arrested on charges of sorcery, and Angelique's life is similarly endangered (having overheard a royal assassination plot).  And this is only the first movie!  The other four titles (""The Road to Versailles"", ""Angelique and the King"", ""Untamable Angelique"" and ""Angelique and the Sultan"") follow Angelique's quest, across several continents and a string of lovers, to re-claim her wealth, place in society, and her missing husband.

The ""Angelique"" titles, churned out in quick succession between 1964-68, were highly successful in their day and still have the potential to thrill audiences with their spellbinding mix of period romance and adventure.  It's a total mystery--to me at least--why Michle Mercier never became a bigger international star, because she certainly had the necessary talent and camera personality.  She's perfect as Angelique; her close-ups are stunning.

The DVD boxset is a strictly no-frills affair, but at least all five titles can again be enjoyed by fans old and new.  Recommended.",1262649600,7,1961,5.438943894389439

Hoping to at least have English subtitles, I am amazed at the reproduction of these films. Beautifully voice dubbed, in most places I was not even aware of the dubbing. The voices were perfect for the characters, and the film itself was spectacular. Even the crowd scenes were well done. A Single word? Spectacular!

Considering that these movies are old, they are perfect, except they stopped making the movies at book five and wound up the action then; on the downside, the French film makers strayed a little but then so did Americans when they produced ""Gone With the Wind"". Still great movies, and hold up on their own.",1251936000,,865,4.766666666666667

I knew from the Friends of Angelique that there had been additional books released as well as a series of movies and never dreamed that I would finally be able to order them (the movies) subtitled or dubbed in English.  The movies are ok, but they are very dated with 60's era hair styles and they are not what I would call ""Americanized, Hollywood high budget blockbusters"".  I'd love to see a really good American director and an A-list cast create a new series of movies, or even an HBO mini-series along the lines of the recent John Adams series, but I know it will never happen, so I guess I'll just have to be satisfied with these.",1236816000,,746,4.314285714285714

an epic with history (the era of Louis IV), intrigue (the court of Versaille), romance (the breathtakingly
beautiful Michele Mercier as Angelique and her paramours while she looks for her true love) and adventure
(involving musketeers, pirates, slave traders, Arabic sheiks). It is unfortunate that Mlle Mercier, afraid of
being typecast, refused to do any more in the Angelique series (there are more novels which carry on
from the point the five films end). The actors (Robert Hossein, Jean Rochefort, Jean-Claude Pascal, Sami Frey,
 Jean-Louis Trintignant) are all excellent as some of the men the adventuress runs into from France to North Africa. Of course, the French locations are spectacular. Superb transfers in widescreen.",1217376000,7,834,5.515625

The photography, interesting plot twists, and the use of the same actors to play their respective parts in all the films kept me watching and wanting more. Each movie was made 1 year after the preceding one so even the aging of the actors seem to be in context with the storyline. Of course, Michele Mercier who played Angelique is very beautiful and watchable.

I especially enjoyed the lack of CGI (as entertaining as that is). Lionsgate did a great job remastering these movies.

I gave this DVD set 4 stars since I reserve 5 stars for my personal favorites (Croupier, The Limey, and Ulee's Gold).",1216080000,2,636,4.669642857142857

3355073,5,B0013XZ6MU,"Hello to all of you globally who support the memory of Anglique - I'm reproducing my amazon.co.uk review where I have also posted images - please visit and see the recent and past photos of the author, now sadly widowed and completing her series by not only writing but also researching the background.

Where can one begin a review of this iconic heroine and do her and her creators justice? I seem to have known or been involved with Anglique throughout my adult life - I read the first book when I should have been studying for my A-Levels! My sister introduced me to the books - she felt I should have outgrown my beloved Jean Plaidy and Chalet School books by that age and moved onto something a little more sophisticated - she chose Anglique for me - and what a choice! I have written reviews for these books on Amazons fabulous review facility and according to the statistics they have proved useful to several readers. I hope I may have encouraged others to seek out the now sadly out of print versions, many of which are commanding obscene amounts of money on ebay probably due to being erroneously described as erotic - shame the sellers don't read their books first!
But to the films - I saw the first film - Marquise of the Angels on BBC2 with English sub-titles - I can't remember much of that other than I was so terribly excited that the books had been transferred to film and Michele Mercier did look gorgeous - seemingly Brigitte Bardot and Jane Fonda had turned down the opportunity to become the eponymous heroine. Considering BBs love for animals and political acumen, she might have paid closer attention to Angliques life which mirrors these two avenues. I digress - a failing of mine. I discovered the second film in Zakopane in the Tatra Mountains of Poland where I was on holiday with a friend of Julie Christie's - yes honestly. We were out for a stroll when we saw the weather front hurtling towards us and dived into the nearest building which happened to be a cinema coincidentally showing the film - it was dubbed into Polish with English subtitles - I loved that film to pieces, especially the visual affect of the Court of Miracles and then the complete contrast as Anglique is presented to the Sun King himself by her cousin Phillipe. As an aside just as I did not discover the existence of three more books in the series until the mid-80s [still unpublished in English despite world-wide interest], so I did not realise that there were 5 Anglique films - those I discovered when I started visiting Paris in the 90s.
It has to be said that the films are visually stunning, the music score beautiful and haunting and the fact that they are now going to be available with English sub-titles is why I am going to buy my third set of DVDs - all the others are PAL SECAM playable over here but with no sub-title facility. I've enjoyed these films because they are entertaining - the characters share the same names as the characters in the books - but the storylines differ to suit the needs of the time - this is no bad thing because thanks to the films the legend lives on and Anne Golon is not forgotten. There is agreement that Desgrez [a real historical character] is portrayed as the most believable and best cast - but we perhaps forget that this is a French invention and will be viewed differently than something like the Onedin Line which is a wholly British invention [with an Anglique-like character in the form of Jessica Benton as James' sister Elizabeth].
There are some superbly innovative ideas in the films and it has a ""happy ever after"" ending which is a shame because the story does continue in the New World and could have created a whole second tranche of films.

Like the movies lovers who have viewed this Classic in tandem and have received hours of pleasure so have the readers of Angelique. The Angelique books proved an international success of gigantic proportions. Estimates of the total number of Angelique books sold worldwide are upwards of 150 million, and they have been translated and published in at least 63 countries, by at least 320 different publishers, in over 20 different languages. Given these numbers, there are only a small percentage of readers who are aware there is indeed an end to the series of Angelique. There are 3 more volumes that have never been translated and Anne Golon is striving to finish the end to Angelique's journey. There are millions of people that have read the Angelique series who are unaware that the story continues let alone they have been deprived of the knowing the story in its full context.
 I urge anyone to visit: FriendsofAngelique@yahoogroups.com  and  [...] to learn the ""rest of the story"".
Happy Viewing, take the plunge. To quote Joffrey de Peyrac, as he and Angelique sailed to the shore of Quebec ""Let the Journey begin"".",1204761600,31,1285,4.885321100917431
3355075,5,B0013XZ6MU,"The original fifteen or so written novels about the Courtesan Angelique were incredibly popular worldwide in the Fifties and Sixties and the series of five motion pictures were produced in the late 1960's as a joint French-Italian-German collaboration. - The huge input of talent,  budget and production values oozes off the screen. No Computer gimmicks here - just sheer gloss, action and pleasure.
I purchased the French Box Set from Amazon UK some time back and the five films were beautifully presented in original DyaliScope (CinemaScope) with restored color and French language. All five Trailers were also included.
My five taped-off-TV in the late Seventies VHS copies still play well and are still very watchable (and in English language) but were naturally only standard screen cut-downs.
If a further updated set is not in Widescreen then why bother? The French Set is worth Ten Stars and the vision supersedes any problems with not understanding the dialogue!
However, for those who have never seen these five brilliant and extremely entertaining movies, I urge anyone to buy this Box Set just to have these Classics in your Home Library.
And yes, the haunting Music Score by Michel Magne is truly wonderful - I was lucky to obtain the overseas pressing of the priceless LP at a Collectibles Fair a few years ago.
These five movies are Gems and have given me many repeated hours of pleasure over the years since 1978 both on VHS and the recent French DVD copies - several times the five have been watched in tandem - they are that entertaining.
And Michelle Mercier - a truly beautiful Actress from the late Sixties era when the films were made, who was ideally cast in the title role. Her husband is played by Robert Hussein who gives an equally lifelike performance in all five films.
My favourite is ANGELIQUE AND THE SULTAN.

3355092,4,B0013XZ6MU,"STUNNING COSTUMES AND CASTLES WITH A FAIRLY GOOD PLOT BASED ON A POPULAR NOVEL SERIES

WARNING: FANS OF THE 1964 FILMS OR THE NOVELS MAY HAVE PRECONCEPTIONS THAT MAKE THIS VERSION MORE DIFFICULT TO ENJOY -- IF WATCHED AS A COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT WORK, YOU MAY FIND IT VERY ENTERTAINING  (see more notes on this below)

INTRO:  This stunning period adventure has a little feel of Alexandre Dumas with some hints of Leprince de Beaumont (Beauty and the Beast) thrown in. It is gorgeously filmed and well acted (though some in France didn't like the casting).  Despite the overtones of Beauty and the Beast I mentioned (Angelique has to adjust to the less attractive Peyrac), this tale is blended with a much broader adventure story worthy of romance adventures past.  Though there is a nice romance at the center of this tale, there is plenty of sword play and tons of court intrigue as well. It's based on the novel series by Anne and Serge Golon.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  Beautiful and independent Angelique has been betrothed to the wealthy Count de Peyrac in order to restore her family's strained financial situation.  It is said he is disfigured and unattractive despite his grand wealth and ancient name.  Angelique goes reluctantly to her new life and informs Peyrac that she is her own woman.  To her surprise, Peyrac is quite intelligent and progressive. He has no intention of forcing her into a physical relationship though he is smitten by her wild beauty and independent nature.  Part of Peyrac's wealth comes from his mine and ability to separate the gold using a technique not known in France.  This makes him a target of jealousy for other nobles, the inquisition based in Toulouse (the same region of his holdings), and even the king himself.  As their relationship develops, powerful forces are moving against them.  However, Angelique unwittingly becomes the real target as a terrible secret comes to light.  Through a series of events, it becomes known that Angelique was witness to a plot to kill King Louis IVX when she was a young girl.  Further, she stole papers from the plotters which hold their names.  Young Angelique had to hide the papers before being caught, so she did not see who the plotters were.  They also did not know who she was until she tells the story to a confessor and is unknowingly betrayed.  The rest of the tale is a process of discovery and tenderness between the Count and Countess de Peyrac, and the conflict that is forming to destroy them.

WHY SOME VIEWERS DIDN'T LIKE IT:  This movie was not well received by the French public and critiques alike.  However, the reasons are those that may not affect many American viewers.  The movie has far too short of a run time to be very faithful to the novels.  Also, there was a movie series beginning in 1964&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angelique-Collection/dp/B0013XZ6MU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angelique Collection</a>&nbsp;which was very well beloved and created many preconceptions of what each character should be like.  This movie did not match those expectations despite competent and popular actors.  Peyrac is also quite a bit older in this version where in the books I believe he was around 27.  However, his age (maybe mid to late 40's) in this version suits his level of education and experience.  The movie also skips from one stage to the next with not quite enough connection or story construction.  It cold have used a little more development.

FINAL THOUGHTS:  Despite the nit picks here and there, this is still a terrific story with gorgeous cinematography and costumes.  One of my favorite little castles was used in the filming though it's actually in Belgium (Chateau de Beloeil).  The castle used for Peyrac was also just plain gorgeous!  If one can accept the sometimes unceremonious scene changes and lack of comparability to book and original film, this is still an excellent period adventure.  The romance at times is actually on the edge of eroticism and there is a fairly sensual love scene.  This would generally fit an R rating.  Nora Arnezeder is stunning and does a terrific job of projecting the intelligence and willfulness of Angelique.  Again, I won't give anything away, but realize this movie only covers part of a much greater story of Angelique.  There is absolutely closure given at the end so you don't have to worry about that, but it may not be exactly what one expects.  If this movie interests you, I suggest watching before going back to the 1964 movies or reading the books.",1421971200,9,4570,4.9526938239159

The films? Although hated by the critics, they became instant classics with the public in Europe and made Michle Mercier the highest paid star in France for a few years. Since their initial release in 1964 - 1968, I have seen them many times and always love to see them again.

3355103,5,B0013XZ6MU,"I have recently watched the movie ""Anglique"" by Ariel Zeitoun and must say that I liked it very, very much, more than I expected. Admittedly, the plot differed much from the book and for fans of Anne Golon, who expect a rendition true to the novel this might be a somewhat irritating aspect. If my opinion on this thing is concerned, I think that films are always adaptations and works of their own. But that's up to everybody's personal preferences, of course. Coming to the quality of the original script, I can't say here anything, because I have watched the film in a translated version.

The main strength of this production and people, who carry it on their shoulders, are the two magnificent main actors: Nora Arnezeder as Anglique and Grard Lanvin as her husband Joffrey de Peyrac.

To me Nora Arnezeder was the ideal choice for Anglique, she not only acted very naturally in this complex role and showed the character just like she was in the books by Anne Golon, as a strong, intelligent and independent young woman, but also looked exactly like I pictured Anglique when I read the books and had her aristocratic and fresh beauty. Coming to Grard Lanvin, I had, before watching the film, my doubts concerning his age (in the book Anglique is 17 and Joffrey 29 years old, whereas in the new movie Anglique's age remains unchanged, but Joffrey is forty years older than her), but from the moment I saw his performance my doubts completely disappeared. For he played the character with great sensitivity, charm and charisma and made Joffrey de Peyrac a true grand seigneur that this personage was in the novel.

Strangely enough, the big age difference between Anglique and Joffrey wasn't palpable at all and their love story very credible. I was indeed very surprised by this, for I thought that an age difference that big would be impossible to bridge, but Nora Arnezeder and Grard Lanvin have done the impossible.

Furthermore, there are in particular two very moving scenes, among quite many of that kind, where Nora Arnezeder and Grard Lanvin reach the height of acting skill: the scene where Joffrey is arrested and says goodbye to Anglique and the scene, in which Anglique visits Joffrey in the Bastille. These moments brought tears to my eyes and I have never experienced that before when watching a movie!

Also worth mentioning is the beautiful scene where Anglique and Joffrey make love for the first time. It was very sensual, but also full of tenderness and the viewer could feel the budding love between Anglique and Joffrey. Kudos to the director of photography, Peter Zeitlinger, to whom I will come later, who filmed that scene aesthetically and in good taste.

The nature of the relationship between Anglique and Joffrey progresses however differently than in the book, i.e. Anglique realizes only much later what her husband really means to her.

Coming to the visual side of the film, what is especially noteworthy to me is the fantastic photography by Peter Zeitlinger, shot almost entirely with the use of natural light!

The realistic sets, decorated with much dedication and attention to detail, and the costumes, in case of which the designers, Edith Vesperini and Stphane Rollot, worked with great care in regard to every single item of clothing, like corsets, stockings and chemises, caused that I felt like transplanted into the 17th century.

In my praise I would like mention the enchanting music by Nathaniel Mchaly, which added much to the atmosphere of the production and to which I could listen with great pleasure, even with no picture, only with headphones on.

To sum things up, I think ""Anglique"" is a beautiful, engaging and immensely romantic rendition of the ""Beauty and the Beast"" fairy tale motive. I'm holding fingers crossed for next parts and keep waiting for them impatiently!

3355107,5,B0013XZ6MU,"The 5 ""Angelique"" movies were very popular in the movie theaters all over Western Europe. That was in the mid to late 60's.
Only 2 other historical movies were as popular, the Austrian ""Sissi"" trilogy with Romy Schneider from the mid 50's and the old American film ""Forever Amber"" with Linda Darnell filmed in the 40's.

What I particularly enjoy in this third Angelique set (I had them on VHS in German some 35 years ago, then ordered another set from infrench.com after the millenium, before I finally bought them on DVD) is the excellent English dubbing.
Yes, no subtitles, but a perfect dubbing.
Trust me, I've watched the German dubbed Angelique movies countless times, I know the dialogues by heart. Unless there's a difference between the original French dialogue and the German dubbing, I can confirm that the English dubbing has the exact same text as the German dubbing. So you are no longer forced to watch these wonderful movies with annoying subtitles.

And once you've seen the movies, you might want to read all 9 Angelique books that so far have been translated into English, because two of the best sequels, ""Angelique, the Rebel"" and the follow up volume which brings Angelique to the New World, unfortunately have not been filmed.

BTW there just was an Angelique remake which was released in France around Christmas 2013. Hopefully it will be available on DVD in the US soon.

3355113,3,B0013XZ6MU,"Keep in mind that I watched with English-dubs (which seemed quite good and I hardly noticed BTW).  OK, the Movie starts with Angelique all grown up.  I can accept that the book set-up of Angelique's genteel poverty is avoided.  Much was accurate at first.  There was Angelique caught with Nicholas, her forced marriage to Jeoffry and seeing his mining endevors.

But the movie (as well done as it is) starts to depart from the books after that.  Gradually at first, then greater (according to my english book translations).  The movie version starts to become less faithful to the books.

Important scenes are left out.  Important scenes are diminished. But most importantly, to anyone who has read the books, Joeffry de Pyrec is revealed to Angelique WAY too early.  He finds her again in the Mediterranean as ""Rescator"" as 'Angelique In Barbary' when that NEVER happened in the books.  And Colin Paturnel was shot and killed at the ending.

Granted, it made a standard movie ending, but it was very shocking and disappointing to see the plot so ruined.

And then there was the casting.  Angelique is well cast.  Her more minor supporting characters are well cast, The detective and the poet and family were great.  But Joeffry was a little fop in the movie, completely unlike in the books. Granted, he did great work moving with his charachter's bad leg. but that was about it.

If you you want to admire the admirable Jeoffry de Peyrac, equal in every way to the outstanding Angelique of the books, you won't see it here.  And you won't see the tension on them both meeting finally in the real story a few books beyond this movie.

I'm not sure how to rate this movie.  On the one hand, I was glad of it and I generally enjoyed it.  I have learned to forgive failures of movies to follow great books.  But it really failed at the end by the books.

I have to give it a 3 at best and mostly because I love the books and are grateful there was even an attempt at a movie.

I'll give this a 3 for there just being a movie made of the first books, a 2 for casting Joeffrey de Peyrac badly, and a 2 for following the books badly.  But I still want to make it a 3 for just existing.

In spite of all, I enjoyed watching it.  Now I just want someome to do the books into a series of movies right the next time.",1375747200,5,2306,4.377358490566038

BUT, alas, these were better seen through the eyes of a young person back then.  For me they are only souvenirs of that era, but they aren't exactly classic movies.  Note: Michele Mercier became so popular through these movies (competing with Brigette Bardot at the time) that she could not get roles of other characters.  She documents this in auto-biographical books she has written (in French).

Being now the grand age of 63,I purchased a laptop and went on line for the first time a few months ago, then one day I
typed in the name Angelique and to my amazment up came all this information,to cut a long story short I ordered the box
set and it arrived yesturday, it seems incredable that all those years ago I had watched that film never expecting to ever
see it again,and here it was on my dvd playing,the film qualiaty is brilliant and i'm just made up so I thought I would share it with you.",1339632000,2,791,4.012658227848101

3355150,4,B0013XZ6MU,"I read all the Angelique books from about 1964 onwards.  I was so excited to see these movies were available at Amazon!!  When I received them in Australia, the only way that I could watch them was on my husband's computer so I spent hours at his desk, sighing and loving them.

When buying a new Blue Ray, I took the movies with me and found only one Blue Ray that would play the American format.  I then re-watched all the Angeliques on a huge screen and loved them just as much.

If you are a romantic, buy these!!!",1331769600,2,518,4.191919191919192

The movies are regularly screened on TV in France but now that I've moved to the other side of the world, I wanted to share some classic movies with my friends... Angelique never seems to rest: she attracts trouble wherever she goes and spends her time trying to get out of difficult situations.

3355152,5,B0013XZ6MU,"Growing up in Germany, I read all 12 books and watched these 5 Anglique films at first on the big screen and later countless times on German TV. However, I will never get tired of watching these wonderful movies, so I always had a VHS version, then later a DVD version from the German dubbed movies and now finally own the English dubbed version which BTW has exactly the same dialogue as in the French and German dubbing. So in case some people think they might miss out on some text and rather select the English subtitles, I can calm you down: the English dubbing is absolutely authentic and nothing is missing from the original dialogues.

For everybody who is into historical movies, I can also recommend ""Frenchman's Creek"" with Anthony Delon (the very good remake of the old film with Joan Fontaine, but this time filmed in Cornwall where the story takes place), ""Forever Amber"" and ""Dsire"" (Michael Rennie and Jean Simmons).",1315353600,3,932,4.717791411042945

3355154,5,B0013XZ6MU,"I was born in 1968 and I became Angelique fans in the Eighties, when I was a teen.
I absolutely recommend these movies, expecially the first one: Anglique is a proto heroine, just before Diana Gabaldon's Outlander, but also the various Lara Croft, Sidney Bristow, Buffy and Xena. And Anglique is also the longest literary saga on the screen before Harry Potter's.
Just watch these movies, there are wonderful. I believe that Sissi movies are too much old style and not so good on a historical point of view. Anglique is much better!",1313625600,,532,4.731182795698925
3355155,4,B0013XZ6MU,"This review is only about the technology and its limitations.

This superb collection of movie gems has been remastered by Lion's Gate Films, and the picture is sharp and crisp and clear, as if it had just been filmed yesterday!

The format is WIDE SCREEN, not FULL SCREEN, as mentioned in previous reviews. We would have preferred the Full Screen format on our 32 inch TV set, but this is the original framing of these movies as they were filmed in the 60's.

There are 3 discs, not 5 as you would expect. Movie One is on DISC ONE side A (side B being empty); movies Two and Three on each side of DISC TWO; and movies Four and Five (being shorter) both fit on side A of DISC THREE. This is a bit confusing, an unusual combination, but all five films are accounted for.

There are no Special Features, no booklet or chapters guide, and the Audio sound is uneven: the French Audio (with subtitles) comes out loud and clear, but the English dubbed Audio is much lower and requires readjusting to be heard properly (thus the four star rating). Let's hope that in future releases, Lion's Gate can correct all these limitations.

Notwithstanding these limitations, this is an excellent collection of movie gems, to be enjoyed and treasured by all Angelique fans everywhere for years to come.",1310169600,2,1286,4.598253275109171

It took me back in time, and with the fact of being an old movie the quality is excellent!  It's a French movie with English subtitles which didn't bother me at all as I am used to that, but it could take some time to get used to. I simply LOVE the 5 DVD collection!

3355171,4,B0013XZ6MU,"Somewhere between the pomp and ceremony of the Romy Schneider ""Sissi"" trilogy, and a series of four Barbara Cartland telemovies in the late 1980's, there is ANGELIQUE.  Based on the bestselling book series written by Anne and Serge Golon, we follow Angelique (played by breathtaking French actress Michle Mercier) through several continents and five movies filled with adventure, bodice-ripping romance, and more than a dash of royal intrigue.

A sprawling saga covering many years and a great sweep of historical events, Angelique (Mercier) is a headstrong young girl, virtually ""sold"" into marriage to the much older Count Joffrey de Peyrac (""Love on a Pillow""'s Robert Hossein).  Covered in facial scars and walking with a limp, Angelique is horrified by her husband, but in true ""Beauty and the Beast"" fashion soon finds a compassionate heart underneath his less than thrilling exterior.  Their happiness is short-lived however, when Joffrey is arrested on charges of sorcery, and Angelique's life is similarly endangered (having overheard a royal assassination plot).  And this is only the first movie!  The other four titles (""The Road to Versailles"", ""Angelique and the King"", ""Untamable Angelique"" and ""Angelique and the Sultan"") follow Angelique's quest, across several continents and a string of lovers, to re-claim her wealth, place in society, and her missing husband.

The ""Angelique"" titles, churned out in quick succession between 1964-68, were highly successful in their day and still have the potential to thrill audiences with their spellbinding mix of period romance and adventure.  It's a total mystery--to me at least--why Michle Mercier never became a bigger international star, because she certainly had the necessary talent and camera personality.  She's perfect as Angelique; her close-ups are stunning.

The DVD boxset is a strictly no-frills affair, but at least all five titles can again be enjoyed by fans old and new.  Recommended.",1262649600,7,1961,5.438943894389439

3355173,5,B0013XZ6MU,"Among the thousands and thousands of people around the world who remain fans of Angelique books, written almost fifty years ago by Searganne Golon (or just plain Anne Golon now) I took a chance with the French movie production of Angelique. Hoping to at least have English subtitles, I am amazed at the reproduction of these films. Beautifully voice dubbed, in most places I was not even aware of the dubbing. The voices were perfect for the characters, and the film itself was spectacular. Even the crowd scenes were well done. A Single word? Spectacular!

Considering that these movies are old, they are perfect, except they stopped making the movies at book five and wound up the action then; on the downside, the French film makers strayed a little but then so did Americans when they produced ""Gone With the Wind"". Still great movies, and hold up on their own.",1251936000,,865,4.766666666666667

As an avid action comic and movie fan  and considering love/ romance stories for Barbara Cartland fan's only,this was the only romantic series that i have ever enjoyed with the beautiful Michelle and all the high adventures you can boot. Spotted it a month ago on Amazon and have been watching since receiving two day;s ago. French with English sub-titels. A big ask for myself as i dislike sub-titels. But in this case an exeption.

I knew from the Friends of Angelique that there had been additional books released as well as a series of movies and never dreamed that I would finally be able to order them (the movies) subtitled or dubbed in English.  The movies are ok, but they are very dated with 60's era hair styles and they are not what I would call ""Americanized, Hollywood high budget blockbusters"".  I'd love to see a really good American director and an A-list cast create a new series of movies, or even an HBO mini-series along the lines of the recent John Adams series, but I know it will never happen, so I guess I'll just have to be satisfied with these.",1236816000,,746,4.314285714285714

Yes - the adventures of Angelique are great, yet the best ones in my humble opinion are the ones she shares with her true love. The guy was an expert in alchemy and knew how to make gold out of the most ordinary minerals. He had his own ships, people all over the Mediterranean knew him and were ready to give up their life for him. The guy was a genius.

an epic with history (the era of Louis IV), intrigue (the court of Versaille), romance (the breathtakingly
beautiful Michele Mercier as Angelique and her paramours while she looks for her true love) and adventure
(involving musketeers, pirates, slave traders, Arabic sheiks). It is unfortunate that Mlle Mercier, afraid of
being typecast, refused to do any more in the Angelique series (there are more novels which carry on
from the point the five films end). The actors (Robert Hossein, Jean Rochefort, Jean-Claude Pascal, Sami Frey,
 Jean-Louis Trintignant) are all excellent as some of the men the adventuress runs into from France to North Africa. Of course, the French locations are spectacular. Superb transfers in widescreen.",1217376000,7,834,5.515625

The photography, interesting plot twists, and the use of the same actors to play their respective parts in all the films kept me watching and wanting more. Each movie was made 1 year after the preceding one so even the aging of the actors seem to be in context with the storyline. Of course, Michele Mercier who played Angelique is very beautiful and watchable.

I especially enjoyed the lack of CGI (as entertaining as that is). Lionsgate did a great job remastering these movies.

I gave this DVD set 4 stars since I reserve 5 stars for my personal favorites (Croupier, The Limey, and Ulee's Gold).",1216080000,2,636,4.669642857142857

Separated from her true love, Angelique embarks on an odyssey to reunite with him. The story line is very loose, I think to allow for Angelique to be seduced by every man she meets.  To give you an example, at one point in her trek, Angelique falls asleep in a haystack from exhaustion.  She awakens to a strange man lying beside her and stroking her hair.  Naturally, they fall into each other's arms and sleep together.
