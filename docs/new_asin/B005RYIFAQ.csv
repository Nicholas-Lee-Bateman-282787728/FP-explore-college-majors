I actually wrote the music and the director took my family out for dinner the other night, so I might be a little biased.  I am looking forward to the next project as much as all the other reviewers.",1363392000,,342,4.34375
8484412,5,B005RYIFAQ,"It's so fun to see indie filmmakers create a great product. I saw a screening of this late last year and laughed out loud again and again. The leads are fantastic and the minor characters (the two ""cops"" at the casting office) were perfect. It reminded me of that old 80's movie ""The Jerk"" but even though I laughed a lot, I was touched by the love story and personal transformation the lead went through. Looking forward to the next film released by this crew.",1325548800,,461,4.435294117647059
