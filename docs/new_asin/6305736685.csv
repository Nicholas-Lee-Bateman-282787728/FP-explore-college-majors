1061052,3,6305736685,"I don't know why the other reviewers were so hard on this movie. Perhaps they expected more from a ""Sandra Bullock"" flick. I enjoyed it. It's a cute and funny movie about a dense thief and his smart girlfriend trying to evade the law.
 Okay, it's not as fast-paced as MIDNIGHT RUN and Yaphet Kotto is not as funny as the FBI man trying to catch them. It also loses a little steam towards the end. But the tete-a-tete and chemistry between Denis Leary and Sandra Bullock works. Actually, by focusing on Bullock one might miss what a great job Leary has done in playing the beleagured boyfriend.
 The digital transfer of the DVD is excellent judging from the stunning New England scenery. It is available for a bargain price and is worth every penny.",1036195200,36,748,4.533333333333333
1061053,3,6305736685,"This is a very slow movie about a thief (Denis Leary) and his girlfriend (Sandra Bullock) who are forced to hold up in a vacationing couples home until they can escape the police.
Leary is his usual naurotic self while attempting to save his relationship with Bullock.",1034812800,,268,4.723404255319149
1061054,2,6305736685,"The only thing that keeps this film from totally tanking is the undeniable charm of Sandra Bullock. She does, however, deserve better than this. Dennis Leary should stick to acting, because, having written this piece of dreck, should he decide to write full time, he will be spending a lot of time on the unemployment line.
The premise is simple. A low life, dumb and inept petty thief, played with some saving grace by Dennis Leary, steals a famous painting that he is supposed to resell to an anonymous buyer at a remote location. Accompanied by his working class girlfriend, Sandra Bullock, who does all she can with this thankless role, they go to a location near the drop off point, only they get there before the drop off day and need a place to stay. They move temporarily into a mansion, whose owners are away. A rich and curious neighbor comes over, but they manage to convince the neighbor that they are friends of the owner and are there as invited guests.
Meanwhile, the FBI is hot on their trail with a team headed up by Yaphet Kotto, an actor too good to be in this film. To make a long story short, Bullock wants Leary to go straight. He waffles. The neighbor goes for Bullock. She finds herself attracted to him but is torn by loyalty to Leary. She waffles. A local kid comes up with some dirt on the neighbor that he shares with Leary. This gives Leary the ammunition he needs to save the day, when the FBI finally catches up with them. To find out what happens, you will just have to suffer through this movie, as I did. All I will say is that what happens is predictable.",1027382400,2,1590,4.41156462585034

1061056,5,6305736685,I thought this movie was fantastic. The thief was cool and his girlfriend the cashier was fantastic but we would expect that from Sandra Bullock. The FBI agent was also cool and I liked at the end when he let the two go. The action in the film was also fantastic. I think the most romantic part of the movie was when Sandra and her boyfriend made up in the end of the movie and she made him promise to change and then ran and jumped in his arms. I also thought Sandra also showed a lot of fight when she knocked him down while at the party at the house of the real thief of the priceless art. I would certainly recommend this movie to all who is hopelessly romantic.,995414400,8,666,4.091603053435114
1061057,5,6305736685,"Althoush critics and pretty much everyone else dismissed this movie as awful, I think it is great.  It is Denis Laery at his best both in acting and writing.  The dialouge between him and a young Sandra Bullock is  excellent.  You get to see his Boston/Irish side like in other in Monument  Ave but in a better plot with better actors. (Although his art theif  sidekicks do have some great one-liners)  Sandra Bullock is also an  excellent sidekick to Leary.  She made this movie before she was a star in  movies such a Speed, but plays a her ""wanting to get out of the  gutter"" character great.  This movie will not be loved by everyone,  but serious Leary fan or Bullock aficionado will appreciate its merit.  Finally, any Homicide fans will enjoy seeing ""G"" Yaphet Kotto in  a less dramatic law enforcement role.",957052800,27,815,4.601398601398602

1061131,4,6305736685,"I was surprised how good this romantic comedy was.  Sandra Bullock was her usual lovable self, very funny, with a little bit of a New York accent.  Dennis Leary, who I've honestly never been a big fan of, was actually very good in this movie.  This is probably the best thing I've ever seen him in.  I noticed that he co-wrote the movie, which kind of surprised me.  Didn't realize he was that talented.  His character is sort of a Neanderthal, but there's a lot of yuks generated by that.  The story is a little predictable at times, but fun to watch.  It's all for the best.  A great supporting cast including Yaphet Koto as the FBI agent determined to get his man.  I don't know why Yaphet Koto always gets stuck playing a cop or government official, but he's really good in that role.  There's a lot of laughs in this movie and I'd say this is a great date movie.",1417910400,,867,4.290123456790123

It met my expectations as a comedy vehicle for Dillane as well as Bullock. The scenery is gorgeous and Bullock and Leary are credible as nitwits. Watching this movie to while away a couple of hours is time well spent if you have never seen it. I would recommend ""Two if by Sea"" to any of my friends!",1385510400,,426,4.144578313253012

1061250,4,6305736685,"A small time crook Frank and his girlfriend Roz decide to get away from everything for a few days after Frank has pulled what he hopes to be that one last job.  Unbeknownst to Roz at the time, Frank has no intentions of stopping his ongoing shenanigans.  As their relationship is addressed, and the typical tensions of any long term relationship arise things become slightly more complicated.  Suddenly the two are on the run from the FBI, while the FBI doesn't even know who they are.  Things are further complicated when the person who hired Frank is not pleased at Frank's sudden change of plans.  Roz meets someone who may be just a friend or.........?

I have liked Dennis Leary for quite a while, ever since I first heard his audio CD ""No Cure for Cancer"".  I have enjoyed him in several movies and of course the TV series ""Rescue Me"".  However when I first heard of this movie, quite some time after it had been released I was very skeptical at first.  I love Sandra Bullock as an actress, though I really was not sure how she and Leary could possibly do anything entertaining together.  I thought that because of how different they are from one another, that this was going to be one long ride to snooze Ville!

I was wrong at my assumptions, as well as pleasantly surprised at not only how well the two played off of one another - but also how well their characters worked into the plot.

Yaphet Kotto who plays ""FBI Agent O'Malley"" is amazing, providing additional comic relief and moving the plot along as well.

I would have loved to see this movie on Bluray; however I could only find the DVD when I wanted to purchase the movie.

Sandra Bullock in one of her early screen roles is hysterical, the locations are breathtaking (shot all around Nova Scotia for New England) and the cinematographer is the guy that won the Oscars for the Lord Of the Rings movies.

1061313,3,6305736685,"Sandra Bullock and Denis Leary actually save this film from sinking totally. The plots and subplots become so convoluted and not very funny, but there is an undeniable lovableness about Roz and her boyfriend thief Frank that keep TWO IF BY SEA floating in rather still waters. Both actors capture perfectly the innocence and naivete of two lovers of seven years who are both struggling to find where they as a couple fit in life. Frank has been pulling cheap theft for years and Roz is always there beside them. They escape everything. Nothing sticks to them. Roz wants commitment of more serious nature than Frank seems to recognise. This is the story that does so well in this film. Bullock and Leary bring such cuteness to their characters. This is one time where a film can be enjoyed on the strength of lead performances, and not so much for a twisted screenplay and direction.
