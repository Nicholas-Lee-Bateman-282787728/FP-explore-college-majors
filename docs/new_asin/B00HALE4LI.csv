8631356,5,B00HALE4LI,"This video series is an all too rare example of the kind of teaching and/or preaching that is greatly needed at the onset of the end-times. Thoroughly researched and documented, this teaching is free from guess-work and arbitrary opinion. The conclusions and perspectives of Pastor Crone overwhelmingly convince that we are indeed in the very last days. This teaching should arrest the attention of all believers and bring many who have fallen asleep back to truly biblical theology at this critical time. Although some will find this teaching tough to endure, it is true to the Bible's portrayal of what we should expect as we near the end of this age. Those who love the truth will delight in seeing the truth so well presented here and those who have ""itching ears"" will hate it. Personally, I can hardly say enough good about it.",1494028800,,833,4.791666666666667
8631357,1,B00HALE4LI,"Beware!! This man uses marginal news stories and apocryphal facts to try and prove his points. He might have better stuck more with the texts from the Bible instead of grandstanding upon them. Research every word this man uses very carefully! Research every news clip and video clip very carefully! I did not start doing this carefully until around volume 7 and it was very eye opening. Many disks in the beginning seem to contain much truth and are very convincing but I did not research these thoroughly but assumed them all to be true. One example from many is in Volume 7, disc 2, part 3 at around 6 minutes into the video. The video has been edited with about 7 seconds cut out after the word powerful at about 5 minutes 7 seconds into the original video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-D4Eu4a3Fk). More is cut off from the end that further confirms what the video is related to. Regardless of political affiliation, one can not manipulate data and proclaim this manipulated data with a different meaning  to be a truth! How would this lady in the interview or a person familiar with this interview react if they saw this lie put forth from a pastor? Can God not transcend politics? If one pays close attention, his views on certain texts will change also during the series to make his points. He claims the woman in Revelation 17 as a symbol for female deity worship toward the beginning of this dvd set and as he gets to the end it is a symbol for the one world religious system. Several pages could be written here but research it yourself! Beware!!",1444780800,,1559,4.648550724637682
