8206019,2,B000SMFT88,"The title, ""The Basics and Beyond"" is a misnomer.  In no way does Brozman cover any lap slide basics.  If you already play lap slide in another format, this dvd may be helpful in learning blues style slide but if you are a slide beginner or even intermediate, pass on it.  It provides no exercises, no basic material to work on--it goes right to advanced level playing.  In my opinion, Brozman is not a very good teacher--he goes over stuff to fast in too little detail, provides no connective material or exercises.  He's a fine musician, he just can't teach.  Maybe this dvd will be useful to me someday but not now.",1220054400,3,618,4.473214285714286
8206020,5,B000SMFT88,"Bob Brozman provides the clearest and most musically applicable introduction to this style of playing that I've seen. The DVD is well made and comes with a booklet detailing the examples covered. If you're looking to explore lap style playing, this is where you need to start.",1201219200,4,276,4.8936170212765955
