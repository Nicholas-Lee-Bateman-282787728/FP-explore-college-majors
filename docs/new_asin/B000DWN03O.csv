8102722,3,B000DWN03O,"The real interest to this movie for me was that it is a Kyoshi Kurosawa movie.
If you are a fan, you ought to check this out. I am, I did and I liked it.
If not, it may not be a movie that you will like as it is a lesser work by that great film-maker.
If you are a fan of sadist insane murderer movies of the type where the entire film
is the action of the murderer and his victims and those attempting to escape,
then this will probably do for a ""good time"".",1383868800,,459,3.7422680412371134
8102723,3,B000DWN03O,"Ok, finally watched this last night. Not bad for a 1992 horror flick coming out of Japan. Not really scary and to me not really any surprises. You already know who the killer is as they don't keep that a surprise and really doesn't put you at the edge of your seat. There are a couple of squemish scenes, but not enough to give this more than a 3 rating. Because I love asian horror films, this film did keep me interested through out.",1366675200,,435,4.190476190476191
8102724,3,B000DWN03O,"I'm still not sure about this movie.
I like it, but in a horrified, wondering way.

It's made almost exactly like a cheesy 80's movie, but it's
good enough to watch to the end.

It's not the great movie the other reviews say, but
if you can get it for a cheap price and like movies;
go ahead and buy it. It's entertaining, and isn't that
what movies are for?",1217030400,,358,4.1
8102725,4,B000DWN03O,"One of the contemporary masters of Japanese film, Kiyoshi Kurosawa here fashions a dark tale that is both a sharp satire of corporate life and a B-movie thriller. A former sumo wrestler (and here, the Western viewer is surprised to discover that not all sumo wrestlers are huge ponderous guys) now working as a security guard goes on a murderous rampage in the company that's employed him.

How did he snag the job with a prior charge of murder? How is it that the only way a surviving employee can get help is by telexing New York City? Kind of hard to understand this, and no hints are provided--at least not to the first question.

As well, the juxtaposition of world-renowned art in commerce (i.e., how much can I buy and sell this Cezanne for?) with the obviously crude and horrible activity the guard engages in that dominates the story, give this film a unique feel.

Though not as well crafted as Kurosawa's astoundingly brilliant ""Kyua (Cure)"", this is nevertheless an interesting film.",1160352000,3,995,4.7398843930635834
