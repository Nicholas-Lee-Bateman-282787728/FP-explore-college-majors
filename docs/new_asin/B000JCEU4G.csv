2670254,5,B000JCEU4G,"I am a True Reba McEntire Fan, I know this because of the way her songs touch my heart.

The videos seems to capture the essence of each song, the story telling the costumes the dancing the expression you feel it.

She is vibrant, good-humored, intelligent, and this incredible woman that teaches us a thing or two just by watching the music video.

2670262,5,B000JCEU4G,"After a long long wait, Reba's music videos were finally released on DVD by Universal Music. This set features 18 of her videos as does Video Gold I. Video Gold II does not feature the entire latter half of her videos as they are not in chronological order by disc, as one would expect. The track listing is interlaced chronologically between the two discs. The set also features a booklet with video credits.",1431648000,,409,4.616438356164384

2670264,2,B000JCEU4G,"I love Reba, but this was a poor copy, both the cd/dvd and the cover (album cover?), and therefore a huge disappointment.  I thought I was buying genuine original products, but this was a copy, and a bad one at that.  The music warbles all over the spectrum, sometimes stereo, sometimes mono.  I live in Thailand so this is (WAS!) one of the only ways I have to buy the music I like.",1422489600,,383,4.219178082191781

2670293,5,B000JCEU4G,"This DVD and the Vol I are a must for all Reba fans, it is a compilation of all the videos that were produced to support her vast array of hits.  CMT has been such an important part of the promotion of the modern country star and so great effort went into the production of these videos, they are short stories set to music.  If you like Reba's music especially as a non US resident where you cant see the videos on a regular basis, this has to be added to your collection.",1186012800,2,473,4.075268817204301

2670302,5,B000JCEU4G,"I bought the two new ""Gold"" DVDs from Reba McEntire. For years the only way to have the videos ""professionally"" was a VHS-Tape from England, which was hard to come by and you had to have the proper player to view it. Now all her videos are finally available on DVD. The minute I discovered this, I ordered both from Amazon.com and had the items shortly at my doorstep (in Berlin, Germany!).

Reba really did things in her videos and told stories. They are like mini movies, and tell a story. Her videos really transform the songs into something more, and really touch you in some way. My favorites on this DVD are I'd Rather Ride Around With You, What If It's You, On My Own, It's YOur Call, You Lie and many others. Check it out Reba fans!",1164499200,11,520,4.371134020618556
