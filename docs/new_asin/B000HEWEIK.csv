2637683,5,B000HEWEIK,"We just watched ""Thou Shalt Laugh"" and enjoyed it tremendously. It's also a joy to know this is family-rated humor and fine to add to our home library where grandkids might select it. We're planning on giving several more as gifts. Buy it and laugh!",1163548800,11,249,4.555555555555555
2637684,5,B000HEWEIK,"I haven't laughed this hard since the Blue Collar Comedy Tours (coincidentally, same producer).  The Blue Collar tours are definitely for people with open minds, who can tolerate some raw humor!  Thou Shalt Laugh is just as funny, but ideal for people who don't wish to be offended while watching comedy.  My favorite comedian by a landslide was Joby Saad...I had tears in my eyes watching him!  But since these comedians are relating real life stuff - we can relate to some or all of it, and it's easy to laugh!

Enjoy - this is definitely a must watch DVD...funny funny funny!",1163203200,17,578,4.627450980392157
2637685,5,B000HEWEIK,"Finally there is quality stand up comedy that is not only clean but from Christians. Theses comedians are overall very talented, some are funnier then others of course but as a whole this is a great dvd. I also very much loved how the comedy applies to all ages. Some are targeted towards adults, others towards teens, and most of them are just plain funny to anyone.

If you are looking for clean, hilarious, stand up comedy this is it.

2637686,5,B000HEWEIK,"I was at the taping of Thou Shalt Laugh when it was filmed in Hollywood.  I was unbelievably hilarious.  In particular, I liked Michael Jr, Thor Ramsey and Gilbert Esquivel.  Amazingly funny.  For those people under the impression that Christian comedians can't bring it or that all of their jokes are about the Bible, or Moses or something - we'll are they in for a shock!

Kudos to the folks at Warner Bros who realized that funny doesn't always have to equal vulgar.  They figured it out with Blue Collar - that rednecks can be funny - and now they've figured it out with Christians too!",1162252800,19,590,4.518867924528302
2637687,5,B000HEWEIK,"I got this DVD early from a ""friend"" and let me tell you, it is pure comedy genius! All of the comics are hilarious! Especially Taylor Mason, the puppetmaster! He steals the show with his interesting characters, Romeo, Paco, Juliette and others. This is a must see and buy if you can't find it to rent, I promise you that Thou Shalt Laugh will make you giggle and it made me cry it was so funny!!! 5***** all the way!",1162166400,8,417,4.225

2637689,5,B000HEWEIK,"If the final product is anything like the live performance then this DVD is set to be a smash hit. Patricia Heaton from ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" was stellar and in my opinion two comedians named Taylor Mason and Joby Saad stole the show! This project was produced by Hunt Lowry who produced Blue Collar Comedy Tour and the marketing guru Jonathan Bock from Grace Hill Media (daVinci Code, Narnia, Elf and others). This will set a new standard in the world of clean comedy. Kudos!",1160697600,21,480,4.658823529411765

2637692,3,B000HEWEIK,"Definitely a mixed bag. Between the different comedians, there is something for everybody with a variety of humor types represented. We best liked Michael Jr. and Taylor, and thought Thor was pretty good; we got a few laughs from each of the three others, but there was one we didn't laugh at, at all...we finally fast-forwarded the rest of his act. Looking through the reviews, some others found him hilarious. Most of the comedy I found very clean and appropriate, and absolutely no cussing or using God's name in vain, but there were mild innuendos, and the comedian we didn't like I didn't personally feel was family-friendly.",1417132800,,630,4.897196261682243

So don't let the 'Christian' make you think it isn't funny.  3 of the comedians are really good, 2 were good, 1 I personally didn't care for and 1 who is now in my top 3 funniest people ever!  I don't want to say who was not my favorite, since every one has a different taste in comedy, but I will mention that Taylor Mason is worth the cost of the DVD alone.",1407542400,,487,3.979381443298969

2637706,4,B000HEWEIK,"With the diversity of comedians here I'm sure there's something for everyone.  I liked most but really loved Michael Jr. and Thor Ramsey.  I'd pay money to go see those guys anytime.

The ventriloquist was pretty good too.  I'd say the rest were hit and miss.  So averaging the five stars of Michael and Thor with the 3 or 4 star work of the others explains why I rated it this way.

I could recommend this to most anyone...",1362614400,,424,4.30379746835443

The only brief moments of satire appearing in this show are directed towards the religious instead, very little comedic imagination here. As much as I admire Patricia Heaton for expressing her pro-life values in the demonic domains of Hollywood, her only satirical remark here was to invoke a common stereotype by those who like to reduce Christians to caricatures as valid.

I do enjoy having it in my collection.  It is hard to find comedy that is clean.  I think they've done a good job putting this together.

I find myself wishing the guys that I do like  had more time, while the performers I don't like I wish they'd skipped altogether.

I love the ventriloquist guy with the puppets.  If you like Jeff Dunham, then this is up that alley.

2637724,3,B000HEWEIK,"I am a big fan of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" and seeing that Patricia Heaton hosted the show is why I bought the DVD ... That being said ... I thought that Patricia Heaton was more of an announcer than a host. She hardly spoke and seemed a little awkward and uninterested - which was surprising for a pro like her!

""The Village Idiot"" was quite a disappointment, to say the least.  Taylor Mason was refreshing and talented.  Michael Jr. was pretty funny.  Thor Ramsey was a delight.

Overall, this show was a B ... It would have been a lot funnier if the host participated more (like Sinbad does in ""Thou Shalt Laugh 3"").  If you are looking for a few good laughs, this DVD will provide that.",1264809600,,692,4.3671875
2637725,5,B000HEWEIK,"We stumbled across the ""Thou Shalt Laugh"" DVDs last year and were pleasantly surprised at how funny the comedians (for the most part) were. We try to limit our (and our kids) exposure to the generally crude and profanity laden stand up comedy that is played on radio and TV, but even on ""family friendly"" satellite radio comedy channels some inappropriate content slips through. The comedians on this DVD all deliver safe performances and some of the routines are down right hysterical.

This is the first DVD of four, as of this writing.

Highly Recommended!

2637726,4,B000HEWEIK,"Great, not quite as funny as I hoped for, but very funny. I'm hard to please when it comes to comedy, though. Bananas series is a little better than this one.",1245456000,,158,4.129032258064516
2637727,4,B000HEWEIK,"The following journals my search.

My first experience with Christian Comedy in years was ""The Apostles of Comedy"", which was very good. For a complete review, click here.  It made me think that Christian Comedy had finally evolved into something we Christians could be proud of. The comedy was clean and hilarious. Much more than simple but boring Church humor.

Now I wanted to see if this was a wide spread phenomena, or just a one hit wonder in a sea of Christian Comedic flops.

My next trial was ""The Clean Stand-Up Comedy Tour."" This one was a complete and total disaster. It was so bad, when I wrote the review, I barely knew where to begin.

But I was undaunted in my search for more good Christian Comedy. Surely there must be more out there somewhere.

After mustering my courage, I rented ""Thou Shalt Laugh 2."" I would have started with the first one, but it was not available. Thou Shalt Laugh 2 was not very good at all, but at least it was an improvement over my last one.

I was about to give up. Perhaps that first good one was indeed just a fluke. But just then, my best friend wrote me that he had a wonderful experience with Thou Shalt Laugh 1. I trust my friend's judgment, so I took a chance. (I have to give my friend a shameless plug here. His name is Eric Wilson and he writes Good Christian Fiction, which is also tough to find. He wrote the book to the movie FireProof.)

Im so happy that I did. The original Thou Shalt Laugh is a gem! It was hosted by Patricia Heaton from ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". Now I must have been one of the few that did not like Raymond, but after seeing this, I have new respect for Patricia. She was a joy to watch as the host. She was funny, charming and genuine.

I was very intrigued to see Thor Ramsey in this one as well. I had given Thor a very bad review in ""The Clean Comedy Stand up Tour"". In this one, he shined. He was among the best on the video.

Jeff Allen, from the Apostles of Comedy, was a pleasure to watch as always. His humor is side splitting and relevant. His routine revolves around married life. My favorite line was ""My father told me one thing about marriage: Do you want to be right, or do you want to be happy?

Taylor Mason is an amazing Ventriloquist. He does a bit with a puppet called Romeo that is a must see. My only critique in his performance was that he uses a little pig in one part of his act. I can accept voices coming from a man or woman puppet. But when it came to this very small pig, it was just so far from reality that I couldn't deal with it.

A new comic, at least for me, was a guy by the name of Michael Jr. My favorite of his routine was ""Someone asked me, 'Are you pro-gay?' No, I'm not pro-gay. I'm not amateur gay either.""

For me, there was only one flop in this video. I had to go back and look through all the names to find him. His name was Joby Saad. Im not sure if this guy really was mentally slow or this was his act. But it really doesnt matter. His act was terrible. But oddly enough, it was also one of the longest. Go figure!

Overall, Id have to give this one a 4 to 4 1/2 stars. If you want some good clean comedy, this one is a keeper. What I cant figure out is how the producers of this wonderfully successful video went on to the flop called Thou Shalt Laugh 2. Such is the life of sequels I guess.....

I am unsure if I will try to take on Though Shalt Laugh 3. Im sure in the end, I will take the plunge and hold on to my hope that Good Clean Christian Comedy does in fact exist.",1237852800,2,3508,4.085880640465794
2637728,5,B000HEWEIK,"Let's be honest. Christians and comedy don't mix in most people's minds. I suppose it's a sad reflection on our self-imposed need to appear pious, and on our beliefs about the nature of God. In reality, I suspect that God has a great sense of humor and that He would love to see us laugh at ourselves a little more often.

""Thou Shalt Laugh"" is hosted by Patricia Heaton (of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" fame), and she does a nice job loosening up the audience for brief moments between acts, but the real test is in the comedians themselves. I'm happy--and a little surprised--to say that this DVD not only made me giggle, but chuckle, and then laugh out loud.

With six different acts, the styles are diverse. Some appealed to me more than others. Some relied on situational humor, others on clever puns, others on props and puppets. All had some funny moments, and the less funny of the acts had the shortest stage time. While there was no cursing or inappropriate subject matter, two or three of the comedians did address marriage and teenager issues with wry wisdom and laughs. Teens were lampooned--along with baggy drawers and erratic driving. The ventriloquist wasn't the best I've seen, but he was quite good and entertaining, and his final impromptu bit with audience members had me in stitches.

For those who are skeptical, I say: ""Give it a try!"" Me thinks, thou shalt do more than giggle...thou shalt laugh.",1236297600,,1418,4.732793522267206

2637762,3,B000HEWEIK,"The main premise of this DVD is to show that ""Christians have a sense of humor"". In fact, you'll see something written to that effect on the front cover of the DVD case. Unfortunately, I didn't feel they accomplished their mission.

HUMOR: I applaud the fact that the main feature of the DVD is clean. Some might disagree with how ""clean"" the content is, but more on that later.

In my case, I got a few chuckles out of the 130 minute affair, at best. The first two comedians were pretty good, but not laugh-out-loud hilarious in my case.

And I knew the only female comedian on there was going to suck when she starts off with the topic of ""weight"". Thankfully, that torture only lasted 5 minutes.

There were a few good ones after that, but I can't remember who they are (hint hint: if they were REALLY good I'd remember who they were).

Finally, the puppet guy at the end was undoubtedly talented, but you can only glean so much humor from repetitive phrases like ""I'm staring at the man"" and puppet back-talk.

I did chuckle at the ""Yugo with me to the Fiesta"" joke, but that was mostly due to the unfortunate fact that I used to drive a Yugo (and yes, it is every bit as bad as everyone says it is!).

CONTENT: If I had to give this DVD a content rating it'd be a toss up between G and PG. If you consider ""OMG"" as the Lord's name in vain, then it may offend you, but it's not like they say g****** (you know the word). As for the few sexual references, I felt they were done in a tasteful way. The only way one could see them as bad is if you have a dirty imagination. And by the way, ""breast"" is a Noun, a body part, not a dirty word.

Honestly, I would have no problem sitting down with a group of people of any age and watching this.

Overall it's an okay DVD. I have to admit that it was refreshing to see those in the audience laughing at something clean for once.

If you're not sure if this is your cup o' tea, there should be an Editor Review somewhere up top that has some text straight from the DVD. Read it. If you laugh at the sample blurbs you'll probably enjoy the DVD. But if you find them cheesy, like I did, then you might want to pass on this one.",1178496000,13,2171,4.123222748815166

Let's have more shows like this.,1171152000,11,341,4.2153846153846155
2637771,1,B000HEWEIK,"When one chooses to pick up a ""comedy"" video, one hopes that laughter would be the only element pushed.  One would also hope that if it were a variety program such as this, that the host would further gel everything together providing us with even more laughter and moments of enjoyment.  That is not the case with Thou Shalt Laugh.  Everything, I repeat, everything was placed in a bizarro blender and cheaply served on paper plates.  The humor, from every comedian that decided to walk upon the stage, was horrid.  I found myself laughing at none of the jokes -- I was unable to relate (spiritually or otherwise) to the entire gist of the program.  I was at a loss with the cheap designs, the ill planned introductions by Heaton (who obviously read the cue cards and collected her paycheck), and the boredom felt by both the audience and performers.  Michael Jr. is a prime example of feeling out of place, giving us a feeling of being out of place, and how the camera just seemed to linger on him even further ... thus leading further into the errors of this program.  Fairness.

Fairness needs to be present when doing a film of this nature.  The audience will respect the program further if each comic has the same amount of time and material.  To me, and probably to others, it looks bad when one comic is allowed twenty minutes, while the next is only allowed five.  Obviously director Cooke saw that the talent wasn't as strong as he liked so he cut others off, while demonstrating favoritism to the others.  Boasting the next Blue Collar crew, Cooke tries -- too hard -- to reenact that same environment and sensation, but instead of transforming a bunch of unknowns into superstardom, he falls flat on his face.  What made Blue Collar work was the fact that it was headlined by one already established comedian, and then two (JUST TWO) smaller ones.  That allowed us to get to know the comedians, to get comfortable with their rhythm and style, before making a judgment.  Alas, that was not the case here.  The viewers are bombarded with one comedian after the next without any sign of acceptance or enjoyment.  Sure, there are the clich images of those viewers laughing, but Cooke tries to out do us yet again by only showing the same three people in a nonconsecutive loop.  Eventually, I found myself smiling at the fact that I recognized the same old audience members, and felt more of a connection to them than to the actual comedians.  Again, this was just another breaking point to an already blunderous ordeal.

I think where this film utterly failed was that it boasted the greatest and sub-performed with the follow-through.  One of the taglines to this film was, ""seven of the funniest Christian comedians on Earth"", so with that said, laughter was to follow.  Blue Collar was funny because a full range of audience members could relate.  If you were not a redneck, sipping your Miller Lite from a koozie with your favorite Segar album boldly printed on the foam, than you at least knew someone that fit the mold.  That element is where Thou Shalt Laugh missed the mark.  It didn't appeal to a general audience.  There was no profanity in the delivery of the jokes, the overall tone of the film was G at best, but there just seemed to be something lacking.  From a puzzle perspective, things didn't fit together at all from the beginning to end.  The host was a distraction from the main attraction which boasted big stars of which could not deliver.  It was sad moment for Christian comedy, not because they didn't try (because they did), but because it was horribly constructed, falsely delivered, and held together with the worst cohesiveness possible, unfunny jokes.

Overall, anyone can tell a clean joke - but should they be considered a Christian comedian?  I think these comedians could have taken it to the next level, but instead (staying on par with the theme of the film), they performed below average and watched as unsuspecting audience members uttered forced laughter and painful responses.  Nothing in this direct-to-video release worked.  Heaton was a waste of money and talent, Cooke's direction was horrid - almost to the point of ""home-movie-ish"", and the comedians - as I repeat again - just were not funny.  I would think that would need to be a big element to this film, but alas, it was not.  I do not suggest this film to anyone, unless you are in desperate need of a good night's sleep.  I applaud Christian comics, but I believe what was demonstrated here was utter blasphemy.

As far as it not being Christian, I beg to differ.  As another reviewer mentioned, one comic does say ""oh my gaw!""  There's never a d on the end.  The other comic who talked about breasts was explaining a conversation he had with his 4 year old son.  Obviously it's not going to be vulgar.  The ""Voodoo"" comments were made by Taylor Mason as one of his puppets.  The puppet talks about his previous jobs, one being a voodoo doll, and another a Sears manequin or however it's spelled..  The other comic who talks about trying to kiss a girl and her shirt being off is the ""village idiot"".  The next line of the joke is that he was in a ladies locker room.

One comic told a story of how he tried to kiss a girl that didn't want to be kissed and when she asked him why he thought she wanted him to kiss her, he said because she ""took off her blouse."" 6. One comic makes several references to Voo Doo. 5. In the ""outtakes"" one comic walks up to a guy and asks him if he's ever used the Lord's name in vain, when the guy replies that he's not sure, the comic kicks him and the guy utters a profanity; which is bleeped out but it is obvious what he said. If you are a true Christian who hungers and thirsts for righteousness, you will not agree with the DVD claiming to be ""Christian."" If you're a Sunday-only or holiday-only Christian, you'll see no problem with the above mentioned material.",1165104000,17,1107,4.226415094339623
