5926924,5,B00EL6NWQI,"I'm putting basically the same review up for all 4 BR/DVDs and I hope you don't mind but they are consistently excellent and I'd be redundant anyway.

I just picked up all four BR sets and am so thrilled.  When I first saw these ""coming"" at my local record store (yes I'm lucky to have one near me Fingerprints in Long Beach CA) I thought, why bother putting out 4 videos from 4 shows on the same tour... and it struck me as overkill or as one review thought a runaway ego.  Yesterday I picked them all up and noted that they are 4 shows, 4 different bands, 4 venues and 4 concepts..

They are all great and for different reasons, but they all share things in common, great visuals, great sound, great playing and great value for money. All come with 28 page booklets full of excellent pictures and information and all come with bonus features about the shows that are consecutive in nature (4 part making of at about an hour a DVD).

Favorite moments for me are Joe's treatment of the late Gary Moore's ""Midnight Blues"" both on his Blues night at Shepards Bush and his night at The Royal Albert Hall. Jeff Becks ""Spanish Boots"" from the trio/Borderline show is also a killer. From the first show which features his TRIO days sound to the blues w/horns at Shepards Bush to the Rock show at Hammersmith and the final big night at the Royal Albert Hall these shows (ranging from 1 hour and 40 minutes to over 2 hours each) are wonderful expressions of a love of music by one of this generations greatest guitarists and for me to have this much classic Les Paul guitar playing is heaven.

I'd caution folks who think its too much, what would you give to have the same treatment by Gary Moore? Eric Clapton? heck...instead of highlights from the CREAM Reunion , what about a BR disc for every night? Complete? Would you want this from Peter Green at his best? Of course. I think that an artist like Joe Bonamassa who is certainly at a creative peak and has music and ideas flying off his fingers should capture as much of this as possible before he's too darned tired or burned out!!!

You can view each individual show to see if there is a song or set list that has more appeal to you. Personally I am in the mood for rock sometimes, blues with horns other times, trio work others, so I'll return to these depending and I'm glad I have all 4.

Not only is Joe himself approaching Guitar God status, worth the price of the ticket, but he's also got excellent sidemen with him.  My earlier opinion that he was technically good but not emotionally invested is NOT supported any longer.  Good soulful performances at the RAH.",1417392000,,382,4.757575757575758

5926950,5,B00EL6NWQI,"I discovered Joe on Youtube by accident. After listening to the Youtube video I knew I had to get a concert video. Joe, quite simply, is a badass blues guitarist and singer. No other way to put it. He jams both unplugged and plugged in this video, backed up by a great band and guest musicians. Joe loves vintage guitars and you'll see why if you order this concert! The opening of the electrified part of the concert begins with Joe playing a great blues song ""Slow Train"" on a 60s model Gibson Firebird. Unmatched sound is all I can say folks. Later in the program he plays the ""Ballad of John Henry"" on a late 50s or early 60s Strat. The keyboardist who's playing an old school Hammond organ completely goes off! Unbelievably good. The intro to the concert all by itself gives you a hint of what an acoustic genius he is. I'm looking to get some more of his concerts!",1415059200,,870,4.343558282208589

5926952,5,B00EL6NWQI,"I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD from beginning to end.  I loved the intro music called ""Albion"" and wish it was longer--Kevin Shirley and another individual wrote this gorgeous piece of music that Joe interprets in a way that is spellbinding.  Again, Joe starts off this concert at the Royal Albert Hall with a wonderful selection of his acoustic numbers. A new song, ""Around the Bend"" was especially beautiful and soulful.  The band looks like they're having a great time with Joe smiling off and on and Lenny Castro looking like a kid in a candy store.  Joe ends the acoustic selections with ""Athens to Athens"" which is a wonderful, breezy and fun song that Joe wrote to further entertain us.  Joe comes back with his ""Slow Train"" number, probably blowing away the first few rows of faithful fans and graciously says a couple of ""thank you very much"" to the audience before beginning.  For this shorter concert, he's chosen some of the same selections as the first RAH concert in 2009 with selections from his ""Dust Bowl"" tour and looks far more comfortable and relaxed than his groundbreaking 2009 concert.  The second disk of this DVD is full of information with interesting details of Joe's career, his journey, how he is able to call the shots when it comes to dealing with the industry.  As I've said before, I'm in for the long haul of following Joe's incredible musical journey.  The man is brilliant and a musical genius and has a great and continuing path ahead of him.  We are all so lucky to have him charm and entertain us!",1413244800,,1535,4.651851851851852
5926953,5,B00EL6NWQI,"I play this DVD as much as possible. Have not loved a guitar player this much since Stevie Ray Vaughn, and earlier Jimmy Page. But the best part is his singing it was awesome. And producer, editor and cameraman was the best. Also Joe has the best musicians backing him. It is a perfect DVD. Would recommend to anyone.",1413244800,,317,4.389830508474576

5926955,3,B00EL6NWQI,"I like Joe's playing, I've bought several of his concerts and he's the real deal.
Just be aware that half of this concert is Joe playing an acoustic set.
That's not what I came to see.
The electric part, although interesting, is more of the ""old black blues players"" style,
rather than the ""wailing electric blues"" I love to see.
More John Lee Hooker than BB King.",1411084800,4,364,4.447761194029851

And even tho Joe uses the tired old 5-4-1 blues formula for a number of his songs, he brings a style so fresh, stimulating, and actually GOOD that he's a joy to watch, and to listen to.  He's right up there at the top with SRV for my taste - we're going to his concert in Rochester this November - can't wait!",1403136000,,370,4.197183098591549

5926964,5,B00EL6NWQI,"This show is a treat because Joe does a full set using acoustic or acoustic-electric guitars, along with some interesting background musicians and instruments.  Then, he does a second set with electric guitars.  The songs on this DVD are very nearly the same ones I heard at a similar concert in Richmond, Va.  The second time Joe came to Richmond, he drew 5Xs the number of patrons as his first time there.  Yep, word about Joe Bonamassa certainly grew like a California wildfire!  I felt fortunate to be able to see this guy in person, and now, I can relive that evening on DVD.",1403049600,,580,4.538461538461538

5926970,5,B00EL6NWQI,"Another great set of discs from one of the most surprising and amazing guitar players of all time! Joe and his mates deliver such a  marvelous list of songs, played like the bands in the seventies used to do: with passion and perfection. It is really good to see that the blues rock genre has, finally, a true king! Buy all four; they're all sensational. One of my favourite tracks: ""Happier Times"".",1394582400,,399,4.541666666666667
5926971,4,B00EL6NWQI,"The first part of this DVD is an acoustic set that is blah at best.  It sounds of old Pennsylvania  Mining Songs.  Very unimpressive.  Then the ELECTRIC SET!  Now you will see what all the hype is about.  This guy is the real deal.
His fingers move faster than my brain can comprehend and I am a guitar player.  But it is not ALL SPEED.  Bonamassa can play a sweet guitar that sings to you.  Bonus Features:  Bonamassa shows just what a humble, down to earth guy that he is.  Also, bought the Double CD of the same name.  Sounds great, but, like all live settings, much better to watch him play than just hear him play..................",1394150400,2,636,4.3418803418803416
5926972,5,B00EL6NWQI,"We are relatively new to Joe Bonamassa. We saw him for the first time on PBS doing the Vienna concert.....had never heard of him and just din't know who he was. Spotted him again on Clapton's 2010 Crossroads DVD. We now have all four Bluray videos of the 2013 London ""Tour de Force"" performances. Does that tell you something about how much we enjoy his music and performances?",1394150400,,377,4.5588235294117645
5926973,5,B00EL6NWQI,The whole tour De Force is incredible.. Joe is spectacular along with the band members. I would recommend Joe's tour De Force concerts to all young or old. He is a force to reckon with. Keep it up Joe will see you in Ottawa Canada,1393113600,,230,4.133333333333334

5926980,5,B00EL6NWQI,"Starting with a few numbers from the Acoustic Evening in Vienna added a special touch to this concert. As always, Joe Bonamassa's performance with the guitar was masterful. I particularly liked the ""new"" sound of the old Bonamassa classics, making them sound fresh, It was also a treat to see Joe play an old Fender Stratocaster, with all it's ""scars"" yet beautiful sound, in between the Gibsons! Joe Bonamassa is as far as I am concerned one of the best guitarists in the world today and this performance with it's variety and style is a good example of that.",1388361600,3,560,4.666666666666667

5926984,5,B00EL6NWQI,"Joe is maturing as a player right before our eyes. Although he thinks of himself as an ""electric"" player, his acoustic set on Tour de Force is spectacular. His musicians are well respected players in their own right and hit the mark. Combine that with the acoustics of RAH, you have BluRay bonanza. Oh yea, the electric set REALLY rocks.",1387497600,,337,4.633333333333334
5926985,5,B00EL6NWQI,Joe Bonamassa plays so many styles of music incredibly well. The set of Tour de Force DVD's is a perfect example of what Joe is and has been all about foe over a decade. If you are not a fan you will be after watching the set of 4.,1387497600,,231,3.7346938775510203
5926986,5,B00EL6NWQI,"This is the last of four stops on Bonamassa's unusual London tour from the spring of 2013.  All four concerts are recorded and transferred in Blu ray.  As the introduction states, 4 bands, 4 venues, 4 set lists.  In this Bonamassa's second appearance at RAH, he combines a bit of each of the previous stops from this tour.  With each iteration, Bonamassa also changes bandmates.

The concert opens with the acoustic group which performed originally at the Vienna Opera House and includes ""Seagull"" and ""Jelly Roll.""  Then, with a switch of players, Joe moves to more traditional blues rock featuring ""Last Kiss"" and ""Slow Train"" and finally a hard electric blues rocking set which includes the well-rehearsed ""Driving Towards The Daylight"" and ""The Ballad Of John Henry.""

The Blu ray disc comes in 1080p with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  Audio options include DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  As has been the case with all of Bonamassa's filmed concerts, the direction is excellent.  Modestly edited, the film showcases Joe and other's musical acumen.  Extras include ""No Man's Land"" which is a look behind the scenes, a making of piece (part 4) and a photo collection of Royal Albert Hall.  The concert and the disc is a stunner.",1386892800,,1219,4.892682926829268
5926987,4,B00EL6NWQI,"No doubt, Joe is one of the best (if not the) around. I've seen him 3 times (once with BCC). This performance is good but I must admit I enjoyed the first RAH show better. Percussion is important to me and the double drumming idea was genius. The audience at this latest RAH show was subdued a bit by comparison. I found the first RAH and Beacon shows to be more genuine. Set list was wonderful. I wonder with all the touring he does how things stay fresh. I'm thinking that sharing the stage with other performers (like the Beacon) might be well advised to do again.",1386547200,,567,4.308411214953271
5926988,5,B00EL6NWQI,"Joe was spectacular as well as the rest of the musicians. Great sound, great camera work and editing. Don't miss buying this one! His maturity, his control and his sound have reached  new peaks, vocally as well as playing acoustical and electrical guitars like I have never seen before. I was riveted for the full 2 plus hours. Thanks to Kevin Shirley and Roy Weisman, producers, for putting this great package together. I hope there are more to come.",1385942400,,451,4.708860759493671
5926989,5,B00EL6NWQI,I've been a fan of Joes since I saw him at Rockplast. I have all of his stuff. This is his best DVD ever. The Ballad of John Henry is awesome. I've been into music for 60 years and was lucky enough to be friends with Roy Buchanan. Joe is the best all around player I've ever seen.,1385596800,2,280,3.8448275862068964
5926990,5,B00EL6NWQI,"This performance showcases all of his current bands including the Vienna acoustic band in 4 sets. Once again the picture quality is absolutely stunning and the audio is better than the video! Once again Joe, along with Kevin, have made a monumental documentary of these performances! Thanks guy's!

I wish Amazon had a 3 Criteria rating system, that would make for a quicker and more accurate rating of Cd's DVD's and Blu-ray's.

1. Performance: ***** +
2. Quality of Audio: ***** +
3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's): ***** +

Bands that wish to have there performances recognized, their recordings should be held to a standard. Poor audio, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard audio quality recordings and rank that product highly are not doing the industry, the band or others justice. Demand better and we will get it.",1385510400,4,900,4.907894736842105
5926991,4,B00EL6NWQI,"Honestly, I like this RAH concert even better than his first DVD. That is hard to say but I really like this one better - here is why ...

1)  Joe is more relaxed and his playing is fresher. He was nervous in the first RAH dvd
2)  I love this set list - great versions of everything - massive Happier Times!
3) for some reason the SOUND QUALITY of this show is better than the first RAH show - the first show set a high standard for both sound and video but this one is superior. I also own the CD of the first show and would buy this on CD if it were out. It really is that much better.

Why did I only give this 4 stars instead of 5?  Sorry, I sort of tricked you. I wanted you to read this because I really do own the first RAH show and I really do like this show better. Everyone else is giving it 5 stars and I doubted anyone would read another 5 star review but they might read one of the lone 4 star reviews. Sorry, there is nothing I did not like about this DVD and I am very glad I own both shows :)",1384646400,4,1008,3.758293838862559
5926992,5,B00EL6NWQI,"I got the whole set. They are all wonderful in their own respects. But this one may very well be the best. I've sat through a few showings of it now and each time it gets better. This was the last night of 4 nights in a row at different venues.

As usual the sound, video, show, production...all great. Excellent audio and video production. I like this mix even better than on last tours Beacon show. This is some of the best reference quality sound for a blu ray concert that I know of. It's absolutely outstanding. If you've got a good system you will be VERY happy. (Hint hint...Hey RUSH....you need to bring back Kevin Shirley...this puts the latest CA Live blu ray release to shame!) Joe's voice shines here where in past concert videos he was a few db's too low. Guitar, drums, bass, keyboards...everything is well balanced. The band(s)... both acoustic and electric are spot on solid. The video shines too. No hurky jerky cut pan and zoom 1 second shots. Every one gets showcased properly.

Each show in this 4 blu ray set has something great to offer. Large to small venues. Blues, R&B, and in your face Rock and Roll guitar! But this is his best RAH disc. Probably his best live release yet. Beacon now a close second. Followed by all the others in this set.",1384214400,,1267,4.456896551724138

Happily listening to the first Blu-ray I got in the series, the Royal Albert Hall disk. I purchased this one first because I thought the ""An Acoustic Evening at the Vienna Opera House"" was such a fantastic piece of work, something a little different from Bonamassa's other stuff. I thought I'd spread them out a bit, but I had to go back and purchase the other 3. As good as the Vienna Opera House disk is, I think the band really tightened up on this one. Wonderful stuff. Great music. The electric stuff is equally well done.",1383004800,7,589,4.3545454545454545
