7946057,4,B00005MKO3,"This two disc set,which has recently been reduced in price, contains four episodes from the A & E documentary series: ""Ancient Mysteries - Myths and Legends"", introduced and narrated by Leonard Nimoy.
  All the four episodes are stereophonic and about 45~6 minutes in length, and as usual with A & E product, does not contain sub-titles.
  The four episodes are:
  Camelot ( 1995 - 45'56"" ) Good, but with no mention of Avalon.
  The Quest for the Holy Grail ( 1995 - 44'48"" ) Good, and actually mentions the bloodline of Christ.
  Atlantis: The Lost Civilization ( 1995 - 45'58"" ) Very good, but glosses over Atlantis' predecessor Lemuria.
  Dragons ( 1997 - 45'28"" ) Okay + ; missed mentioning how something this supposedly large and heavier than air could fly... ( Internal gas chambers in their bodies similar to an internal hot air ballon, plus hollow bones to lessen weight ).

  ...worthwhile for your video library - obviously this title was originally published before dual layer dvd's became the norm....",1022025600,63,1014,4.847953216374269
