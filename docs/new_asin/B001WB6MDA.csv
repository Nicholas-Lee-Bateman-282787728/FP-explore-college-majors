3826073,5,B001WB6MDA,"Island of the Fishmen is about a shipwrecked doctor and respective prisoners who drift to a strange, secluded island and start croaking either by outlandish traps or by ferocious humanoid Fishmen that ascend from the water to destroy them.

Even for Italian horror this is sluggish; plodding acting, straggling editing, unconvincing but fun models, and illiterate script. I'm dumbfounded that Barbara Bach and Joseph Cotton kept their real names on the credits.  Though Barbara Bach looks especially hot, and the ferocious humanoid Fishmen are moderately peculiar looking.

In many ways this is a typical Italian cheap, exploitation version style movie.  It is an inferior rip off of The Island of Dr. Moreau (1977)  with an empty-headed Atlantis plot superimposed in. The story, such as it is, is fairly good for this genre, but it is quite slow and inconsequential on action so it still falls flat. Also, the island doctor isn't named Doctor Moreau. His name is Edmond Hackham and Prof. Ernest Marvin.  This is a lethargic paced story that may not quite live up to ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" in terms of self-assuredness, but I found it simple cheese entertainment.",1264982400,,1167,5.052083333333333
3826074,3,B001WB6MDA,"I loved this film back when it was called SCREAMERS. And I knew they were going to release the non gory fantasy version, which was okay with me as long as we were finally getting a good qualaty picture version. Wrong!! The one I got looked worse than my old VHS copy. The darks were too dark. the colors all faded looking, and some time during the night scenes, you cuold see these wierd bluish blobs appearing in the blackness. They must have found the oldest, crustiest copy of this for their transfer, because it really did not look very good. Maybe screamers will one day get a DVD release and they'll at least have a decent old tape to transfer it with. They can borrow mine!",1255219200,4,680,4.362204724409449
3826075,4,B001WB6MDA,"THIS IS A PRETTY CHEESY MOVIE. DURING THE LATE 70'S AND EARLY 80'S ITALY BASICALLY TRIED TO CASH IN ON THE SUCCESS OF U.S. MOVIES WITH THEIR ""REVISIONS"". ZOMBI2 WAS TO CASH IN ON DAWN OF THE DEAD. BOTH OUTSTANDING FILMS. IN THIS CASE IT WAS TO CASH IN ON THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU. UNFORTUNATELY THIS FILM IS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD. I GAVE IT 4 STARS BECAUSE ITS STILL A FUN MOVIE TO WATCH IF YOU ARE A FAN OF ITALIAN CINEMA. THE GUY WHO DIRECTED THIS IS ACTUALLY A VERY INTELLIGENT AND GOOD DIRECTOR. HE DID MOUNTAIN OF THE CANNIBAL GOD THE SAME YEAR I BELIEVE. THIS MOVIE WAS ALSO KNOWN AS ""SCREAMERS"" HERE IN THE STATES. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST DVD RELEASE IN THE STATES I BELIEVE, AND THIS ONE IS 9 MINUTES LONGER THAN THE PAL VERSION. (WONDER WHATS THE 9 MIN ABOUT) WELL SEE HERE SHORTLY. BY THE WAY SPEAKING OF ZOMBI2, RICHARD JOHNSON IS IN THIS FILM TOO. I THINK THATS WHY I GAVE IT THE 4TH STAR... I AM RATING THE ""L'isola degli uomini pesce"" VERSION, SO THIS ONE MIGHT BE BETTER, AS FAR AS QUALITY AND THE EXTRA 9 MINUTES ARE CONCERNED.",1247184000,9,1039,4.148514851485149
8347384,1,B001WB6MDA,"The one star rate is for the price, not the movie. $84? Haha. the movie is great and can be watched on U-tube. If you want to sell this, better lower you price. $84? Haha.",1473552000,,171,3.914285714285714

Corman cut 20 from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/l-isola-degli-uomini-pesce/dp/B000CCTDPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">l'isola degli uomini pesce</a>, shot an additional 15 minutes (mostly a prologue) and called it&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Screamers/dp/B00JV054A6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Screamers</a>.

I've seen many versions of this film, from the TV broadcast of Screamers some 30 years ago, to its VHS release, to the two above versions (the NoShame Italian version and the Blu-Ray American version).

I don't think there's much difference. Screamers is not THAT much more gory.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/l-isola-degli-uomini-pesce/dp/B000CCTDPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">l'isola degli uomini pesce</a>&nbsp;has more talk, but I like that. It makes for a richer, fuller characters.

The Italian version was shot as a rubber-suit monster movie. Corman tried to market it as a slasher film, hence the additional footage, plus a lot of false marketing (all explained in the Screamers DVD special features).

IMPORTANT -- If you want to see the Italian version, get the NoShame&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/l-isola-degli-uomini-pesce/dp/B000CCTDPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">l'isola degli uomini pesce</a>, and NOT this Mya version. Reviewers are complaining about Mya's poor visuals. That's NOT the case with the NoShame DVD, which is widescreen, with beautiful visuals that are almost (not quite) as sharp as the Blu-Ray&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Screamers/dp/B00JV054A6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Screamers</a>.

BOTH the NoShame Italian version, and the Blu-Ray Screamers, have tons of special features.

The NoShame DVD has about an hour of interviews with three Italians who participated in the film. Unfortunately, the interviews are in Italian, without subtitles. BUT the film itself has both an English and Italian soundtrack. Subtitles are only in Italian. And the NoShame DVD is PAL, so you'll need a region-free DVD player.

The Blu-Ray Screamers has several interviews with people involved in the shooting of additional footage, and the new editing and marketing, including Corman.

Another difference: The NoShame&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/l-isola-degli-uomini-pesce/dp/B000CCTDPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">l'isola degli uomini pesce</a>&nbsp;is brighter than the Blu-Ray&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Screamers/dp/B00JV054A6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Screamers</a>. In the former, Barbara Bach has strawberry blond hair. In the later she's a brunette.

If you prefer Corman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Screamers/dp/B00JV054A6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Screamers</a>, fine. But do NOT judge the Italian version by the Mya DVD. Judge it by its beautiful NoShame version. (Which, sadly, seems to be out of print and over-priced.)",1420502400,3,3577,8.48936170212766
8347386,4,B001WB6MDA,"A group of convicts and the prison doctor are adrift in the Caribbean, where they are attacked by aquatic mutants. The survivors wake up on the shore of an island. It doesn't take them long to realize that their troubles have only just begun. The island is inhabited by, among others, a man named Edmond Rackham (Richard Johnson- THE HAUNTING, BEYOND THE DOOR, ZOMBIE) and his beautiful wife, Amanda (Barbara Bach- ALLIGATOR, THE UNSEEN). The cons soon find themselves in a nightmare of voodoo, insanity, and death at the hands / fins of the title abominations! Obviously, the big draw of this movie is Ms. Bach, who is incredibly HOT! Still, the monsters aren't bad either, in their own scaly, cheeeze-log way. An awesome catch!...",1402358400,,732,4.864

8347388,5,B001WB6MDA,"Fun ""Island of Dr. Morreu"" movie, with cool Lovecraft inspired fish monsters. Hot as ever Barbara Bach looking good. Look, any movie with fishmen and Barbara Bach......I shouldn't even have to try to convince you on.",1369440000,,216,5.027777777777778
8347389,3,B001WB6MDA,"I was really surprised to see this salad bowl called ""Island of Fishmen""--lost city of Atlantis for a start, conspiracy, some representatives of Latin American tribes, shaman, shipwreck, mad scientist and, finally, Barbara Bach and couple white guys who are trying really hard  to grab this prize. You may think or hope that for movie with ocean beach Barbara will show us her beauty--no luck, my understanding is you have to buy obscure Italian flick ""Supertyp"" to see her in full glory.",1362355200,,488,4.951219512195122
8347390,4,B001WB6MDA,"Island of the Fishmen is presented in an anamorphic widescreen that preserves the film's original aspect ratio. This transfer has been flagged for progressive playback. The DVD case lists how this transfer was sourced from original negative elements and the end result is one of the better looking transfers from Mya Communication. The source used is in excellent shape with vibrant colors, natural looking flesh tones, black levels fare well and details look generally sharp throughout. To date this is the third DVD release of Island of the Fishmen that I have come across with the previous two being a German DVD release from Marketing Film and an Italian DVD release from No Shame. The German DVD release which has English language opening credits is the weakest release of the three (it is also interlaced) and the Italian DVD release which has Italian language opening credits appears to have used the same source that is used for this DVD from Mya Communication.

This release comes with two audio options a Dolby Digital mono mix in English and a Dolby Digital mono mix in Italian (there are no English subtitles included with this release). The English audio mix is the stronger of the two as there are no problems with background noise or any other audio defects. Also dialog is crystal clear and everything sounds balanced throughout. There is some mild background noise present on the Italian audio mix.

Extras for this release include a theatrical trailer for the film (3 minutes 47 seconds - in Italian, no English subtitles) and a photo gallery with 27 images (stills / posters). Overall Island of the Fishmen gets a strong audio / video presentation from Mya Communication.",1288915200,8,1690,4.947183098591549
8347391,1,B001WB6MDA,"Don't bother with this disc, it's poor quality and when I tried playing it via my dvd boosted to 1080 on my LCD-TV, the picture quality was more atrocious than the movie. To make matters worse I thought or was at least hoping this was or would have Screamers in there somewhere. Please would some good quality company release Screamers as Island Of The Fishmen plays out like a Disney film gone wrong.",1280361600,,401,4.506849315068493
8347392,3,B001WB6MDA,"ISLAND OF THE FISHMEN is one of three films belonging to director Sergio Martino's Adventure trilogy, which also includes BIG ALLIGATOR RIVER and gore shocker MOUNTAIN OF THE CANNIBAL GOD. In it, a prison boat capsizes on an uncharted island, where the surviving shipmates fall prey to a species of mutated fishmen with a taste for blood! They soon discover that they are not alone, and that there is more to fear in the secretive doctor working on the island. Much of the action and horror has ultimately been reduced in place of the wordy dialogue in this specific cut of the film, but between the island's many booby traps, pitfalls, and amphibious terrors, the pacing maintains a steady flow. ISLAND'S full-bodied creature designs and miniatures are considerably well-made for the budget, recalling Roger Corman's HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP that would follow two years later. Where the film finds the most fault is in its familiar Z-movie plotting, bland writing, and stock characters. Falling somewhere between Martino's other two Adventure films, ISLAND OF THE FISHMEN is a mildly entertaining creature-feature that is sure to appeal to Italian film buffs.

8347393,3,B001WB6MDA,"The steam was gone from Italian cinema by the mid-70`s, and by this time (1979), it was just capitalizing on knocking-off whatever the 'flavor-of-the-month' movie was popular. Even directors who once did great flix like Sergio Martino ('Torso', 'All The Colors Of The Dark', 'Case Of The Scorpion`s Tail','Strange Vice Of Mrs. Wardh','Gambling City', 'Your Vice Is A Locked Room', etc.) had jumped on this bandwagon with varying degrees of success. Ruggerio Deodato struck gold with the original exploitation masterpiece 'Jungle Holocaust' in `77, based in part on a newly discovered cannibal tribe in South America (no joke), and Sergio struck  w/ 'Slave Of The Cannibal God'/'Mountain Of The Cannibal God', the following year going back to the jungle to film both 'Big Alligator River' and 'Island Of The Fishmen', which both had the same actors and locations, for the most part. This one is less exploitive than the others mentioned, but it`s equal parts 'Creature Of The Black Lagoon','Island Of Dr. Moreau','Jungle Holocaust', and the creatures look like those from 'Horror At Party Beach' (1964). This is low-class-cheese-on-the-seas, for certain - bad acting,weak script,cheap sets,ridiculous monsters, you name it, it`s all right here. It`s good if you like campy monster flix and want a few laughs, but little else. The only real horror here is hearing Italian actors speak with British accents. These films proved Barbara Bach was no more than eye-candy, and the curse of being a 'Bond' girl struck again - no actress ever went on to become anything bigger after being in one. Sad but true.",1267833600,2,1600,5.153846153846154
