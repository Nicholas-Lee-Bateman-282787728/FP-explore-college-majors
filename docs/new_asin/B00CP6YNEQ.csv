5731908,1,B00CP6YNEQ,"Any DVR products really hinders for hearing loss folks who ever wants to see this video with captioning available. Lots of Warner Bros DVR does not carry any captioning that makes me frustrated to have any kind of accessible for me to watch. I collect Popeye with Universal's release and it contain with English subtitling with its volume 1, 2 and 3. But with its color Popeye's releases are without captioning.

5731909,3,B00CP6YNEQ,"This is a great collection of Popeye cartoons fron 1960-61, the ones I like best. The only problem I have with this collection is the omission of the ones that were animated in a more haphazard fashion as they tend to be funnier. For example, the cartoons were Popeye goes back into time via Professor Watashnazzle's time machine are priceless. Release ALL the cartoons, please!",1370131200,3,378,4.8307692307692305
5731910,5,B00CP6YNEQ,"These were the first Popeye cartoons made for TV and that many of us grew up with, as most of the original Fleischer cartoons were no longer in syndication due to them being in black and white.

The executive producer Al Brodax commissioned 5 studios, who made 220 episodes from 1960 to 1962.

The studios were Jack Kinney Productions, Rembrandt Films (William L. Snyder and Gene Deitch), Larry Harmon Productions, Halas and Batchelor, Paramount Cartoon Studios (formerly Famous Studios), and Southern Star Entertainment (formerly Southern Star Productions).

This 2 Disc Set contains mostly the cartoons produced by Paramount Cartoon Studios, who made the best ones. They were formerly Famous Studios, who produced the theatrical color cartoons in the 50s that are still in TV Syndication today.

Even though these were made for kids and used ""limited animation"" they have their own charm and are my personal favorites as I grew up with them. Unlike other Popeye cartoons Bluto's physical appearance was slightly modified and his name changed to ""Brutus"". Also the inclusion of many other King Features characters such as the Sea Hag, King Blozo, Rough House etc. are found in these. This is also the series that the 1982 Nintendo Arcade Game was based off of, specifically the Paramount studios version to promote the movie.

== DVD Production ==

This appears to contain all of the Paramount cartoons, however, according to any online sources they do not seem to be in chronological order.

The Film Prints appear to be the same ""high quality"" transfers used by KOCH VISION in 2004 for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Popeye-75th-Anniversary-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0001BFDK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Popeye (75th Anniversary Collector's Edition)</a>, except these have been kept untouched and are NOT poorly remastered.

Koch Vision vs. WB: Koch Vision did NR and removed the minor film grain and did average color correction (when video fades you can see the colors not match). These look just like you remember them, the color isn't bad and the sound is perfect. Unfortunately Koch Vision did NOT know how to do proper audio remastering and those DVDs suffer in muffled audio that sounds like the old Dolby NR on a cassette deck. These have the old true audio back, much clearer sounding! No remastering is far better then Bad remastering!

This is a DVD-R VOD (Video On Demand) so no extras or anything but a plain menu, but that's fine as it's the cartoons that matter. I will take a DVD-R over lousy ""DRM crippled"" digital downloads any day!

OVERALL: I love this set and am so pleased that WB opted to leave the raw transfers alone, instead of doing bad remastering like Koch did with them; and that WB has done with others (i.e. Dragon's Lair came out terrible).

I do hope WB releases the rest of the cartoons.",1369440000,33,2871,5.165948275862069
5731911,5,B00CP6YNEQ,"As you may know, this is the first volume in the collection of the 1960s made-for-tv Popeye shorts. There were about 220 of these made from a handful of different studios in the early 1960s. Although many Popeye fans may consider these lower quality animation since they were produced in a hurry by these studios, I consider these my favorite Popeye cartoons of all time and the ones that I remember the most. If it wasn't for these simple and short Popeye cartoons, I don't think I would ever have been into Popeye as much as I was.  These cartoons frequently used re-hashed backgrounds and some re-used scenes (mainly the Jack Kinney productions), but there were some pretty classic toons in this bunch as well.  My personal favorites were from the Paramount and Larry Harmon studios.

The amazon description is correct about the discs being DVD-R as you can see the purple color underneath the discs but the labeling is still professionally done. They are made on a per-order basis by Warner Archives, so there really is no difference from mass produced versus these well packaged ones.  The only difference is that they are on those DVD-R discs, but still have the professionally produced screens/labels on the discs.  I didn't see any bonus extras on the two discs.

I hope the remainder of the 220 episodes gets released soon on Volumes 2 and possibly 3.  If you like those Popeye toons, these are a must for your collection.",1369094400,5,1431,4.745967741935484
5731912,3,B00CP6YNEQ,"It's no secret among Popeye fans that the King Features Syndicate made-for-t.v. cartoons of the 1960's are far inferior to the theatrical Popeye shorts made by the Fleischers and, later, Famous Studios.  Television budgets simply could not justify the cost of hiring artists and production personnel that would be able to compete with the more polished earlier efforts.  So, for better or worse, an entire generation of kids was raised on this version of the spinach-loving sailor.  And the series was both very successful and quite prolific.  So surely there must be SOMETHING good about them. . .right?

Well, for longtime fans of the original Popeye comic strip, the KFS cartoons DO accomplish something that no other version did: incorporate original comic-strip characters like the Sea Hag and King Blozo.  And although a handful of Fleischer cartoons did feature the magical Eugene the Jeep and the Goons, these characters are more prominent in these later films.  And in a way, the exaggerated personalities are a better fit for the stories, which are clearly aimed at children.  The animation, as stated above, was made for television. . .and it simply isn't very good.  A repeated example that I noticed is how characters's eyes would have pupils in close-up shots, but from a further distance, the eyes were simply black dots.  Maybe that's a budget thing, maybe it's just lazy animators.  Or more likely, animators who didn't have time to crank out more detailed work on a t.v. schedule.

As a Popeye fan, I do have to say I'm grateful to Warner Bros. for making these cartoons available.  As this is a made-on-demand DVR product, the shorts don't appear to be remastered.  However, almost all of them look perfectly fine.  And considering how limited the artwork and animation were to begin with, I doubt they could look too much better.  Unfortunately typical of these type of releases is the absence of any bonus features.  All you get is the choice to ""Play All"" or select individual cartoons.  Popeye enthusiasts may want to note that a good number of these shorts were previously available on Koch Visions'<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Popeye-75th-Anniversary-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0001BFDK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Popeye (75th Anniversary Collector's Edition)</a>.  I admit I have not done a side-by-side comparison for quality, but the duplicated cartoons don't seem to be any better or worse in the new release.

I do hope that after WB finishes off the 60's Popeye (this is just Vol. 1, after all), they will be able to get good copies of the 1940's and 50's Famous Studios cartoons, mainly of which have languished in washed-out public domain hell for many years.  But the bottom line for this collection is: If you're a Popeye fan, you'll want to have it and MAY be able to overlook the shortcomings of the material.  If you're a parent and want to introduce your kids to Popeye, this is certainly the safest bet (very little violence, no smoking, etc.).",1368576000,11,3023,5.151639344262295
5731913,4,B00CP6YNEQ,"Well let me start off by saying some of these are not in order,and some are,they go hoping around from 1960 to 1961 and back again.
So i was disappointed in that,also they didn't play on my main Sony dvr,but that's not a big deal.
The quality looks to be good along with the sound.
Both discs have silent menus,both have 36 toons on each disc.
Disc 1 comes in with a running time of 123m and Disc 2 with a running time of 125m.
No episode titles shown on back cover at all,you have to play the discs to find out.

So far I just finished Disc 1 and my only problem is some of the episodes seem to stall and pause then get bitmapped. sometimes the film freezes for some time and jumps back to content page which I find annoying. Unfortunately I don't have the privilege to bin watch all my Dvd purchases especially completed seasons. This 2 DVD set is 409 minutes total so I can't return it due to over a month purchase.
