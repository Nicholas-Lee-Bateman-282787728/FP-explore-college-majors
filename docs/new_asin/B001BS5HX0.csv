8284391,4,B001BS5HX0,"Wow, first movie, Maximum Risk is about poverty and revenge.  One of the twin babies was sold to a Russian mob.  He was a bad guy in two outstanding ways; 1) Rob money and Steal the robbery from his boss.  2) A turncoat working for the FBI.  .  He was hunted by 4 groups of shooters; 1) His boss  2) His envious partner  3) FBI  and 4) Corrupted agents.  In the opening of this movie, he was chased and fired.  He died in a street.  Now, the dead man's twin brother, a detective, learned from his weeping mother of the truth: 1) His twin brother was sold as a baby.  2) Getting killed as seen in TV news.  Who killed his brother?  He then made a flight to America.  In a gangster-run strip club, he met his twin brother's girl friend.  Next, he got involved with the above-mentioned 4 groups and a bank deposit box in France.  Inside this box, he found money the robbery and a cassette tape.  Revenge was all he wanted.  This is the main frame of this movie.  Ah, 3 of these 4 groups were bad guys.  They got killed or arrested.  A happy ending?  He took his dead brother's girl friend as his.  Second movie, Double Team was a fancy way against terrorism.  Underground computerized information center and magic survival skills were presented but not convincing. The plot?  Forget it.  Entertaining?  Very mild.",1471910400,,1310,4.390756302521009

8284397,4,B001BS5HX0,One of JCVD's better movie believe it or not. I just wish they hadn't put Dennis Rodman in it. The movie would have been great without him.,1370131200,,139,4.185185185185185
