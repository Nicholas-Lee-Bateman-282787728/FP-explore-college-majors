8003348,5,B00000IBSO,"I used to be a U.S. Air Force T-37 instructor pilot. I had a blast when I used to fly this thing. It's small, under-powered, and slow compared to any small jet the USAF has, but it's fully acrobatic and fun to fly. This video proves that you can still pull off a great airshow like the Thunderbirds in this jet. It was also neat to watch the Portuguese pilots go through their flight planning and mission briefing activities.",1236643200,,425,4.3924050632911396
8003349,4,B00000IBSO,"This DVD provides a good look at formation aerobatics from several different points of view (in-cockpit, external, etc.).  While there is no narration, it has great visuals and is worthwhile for any aviation enthusiast.",1105488000,3,219,5.4411764705882355
8003350,5,B00000IBSO,This is a unique demonstration to all pilots that flew the T-37 of what the jet can do. This aircraft is powered by the same engines as the American T-37B. Believe it or not.,936748800,4,174,4.147058823529412
