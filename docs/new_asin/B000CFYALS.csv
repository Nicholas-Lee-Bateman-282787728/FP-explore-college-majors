8170280,5,B000CFYALS,I can't believe you can't buy this film.  I am not  a surfer and I found it fantastic.  I saw it years ago I think on Netflix.  Whoever is sitting on it is either a moron or an A-hole.  I know nothing about marketing but I bet I could market this to relative success.,1404000000,,267,3.8703703703703702
