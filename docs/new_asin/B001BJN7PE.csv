8283333,3,B001BJN7PE,"LADY WHIRLWIND (1972) is the latest DVD release from the Fortune Star Legendary Collection to feature 1970s kung fu diva Angela Mao. It has a strong rep among Ms. Mao's fans, but it isn't quite as good as her two earlier releases in this line, BROKEN OATH (1977) and WHEN TAEKWONDO STRIKES (1973), both also reviewed on this site. While LADY WHIRLWIND does have its share of blistering fight sequences featuring Ms. Mao (billed as Mao Ying), they all occur in the first hour, leaving the climactic action in the last 24 minutes to the film's nominal lead, Chang Yi (EAGLE'S CLAW). The simple plot doesn't offer the excitement and suspense of the later films and consigns Ms. Mao's character to supporting status. Chang Yi plays a fighter, Ling Shih Hao, who was left for dead in a pre-credits sequence after a beating by a gang of criminals and their Japanese leader. Angela comes looking for Chang Yi, angry at him for abandoning his lover, Angela's pregnant sister, who'd then killed herself, all of which happened three years earlier, exactly the time Chang Yi went into hiding. Angela finds him and wants to fight him to the death, but he and the farm girl (Wu Ching Erh) who'd saved his life and nursed him back to health beg for extra time so he can get his revenge against Tung Ku, the Japanese gang leader (played by Pai Ying). Angela relents and even helps out in a few spots.

The movie misses a good bet by not having Angela and Chang Yi team up for the final set of battles. As a result the film doesn't quite deliver the goods I was expecting. Granted, Chang Yi and Pai Ying are noteworthy screen fighters, as are some of the supporting players, most notably Sammo Hung, who gets his butt kicked by Angela twice in the first 15 minutes, and Chien Yuet San, who plays a Japanese karate expert and makes an honorable attempt to actually look and move like a Japanese fighter (something Pai Ying doesn't bother with). But none of them are quite as breathtaking in motion as Angela when she takes on multiple opponents. There's magic in the air when she squares off in front of the camera and the film suffers from her absence from the climactic bouts.

The film is simply and cleanly photographed and staged, much of it outdoors, often on picturesque Taiwan locations. (You can see the actors' breath in some shots, revealing how cold it was.) The print used for this DVD has its flaws here and there, but it's probably the best we're ever going to see of this title. It's certainly far superior to the full-screen bootleg English dub that used to circulate. It's letter-boxed, but the aspect ratio is a little off with some picture information cut off on the sides of the frame in some shots. The film is in Mandarin with occasionally error-ridden English subs. The DVD includes the original trailer, plus a photo gallery consisting of original lobby cards. The music score is all over the place and includes snatches taken from James Bond movies and soundtracks by Ennio Morricone and Bernard Herrmann. For the record, the film was shown in theaters in the U.S. in 1973 under the title, DEEP THRUST, part of the very first wave of kung fu movies to be released in English.",1214697600,4,3184,4.60387323943662
