8371342,4,B002JB5ASU,"I really like the scenery in Paula Liebe's yoga DVD.  It is set in Mexico (the Atlantic side) in a peaceful, beautiful, calming setting.  I wouldn't say this is my favorite workout -- it's only moderately challenging and there is only one routine, which is just shy of one hour long.  I'm also not wild about Paula's voice, which is deep with a German (?) or similar accent, but if you aren't in the mood for yoga led by a cheerleader type, this one is a good one to have on hand.

I own about 20 yoga DVDs and I go to this one when I want a yoga workout (a workout, not restorative, not stretchy or ""yin"" yoga) that isn't going to kick my behind and also when I'm feeling a little tired but want calm energy, not ""peppy"".  It would rate a ""5"" instead of a ""4"" if there were multiple workouts of varying lengths.  I would purchase this one if I had to do it over again.",1304553600,,869,4.08235294117647
8371343,5,B002JB5ASU,"A nice yoga workout, suitable for all levels and easy to follow. Situated in beautiful, inspiring surroundings in the Mexican caribbean. A wonderful souvenir or a mini vacation for your home!",1258848000,,191,5.193548387096774
8371344,5,B002JB5ASU,"Being an older man who has only been working with yoga for several years I bought this DVD on spec hoping it would not be too advanced.  From the very first viewing I was inspired and use the DVD all the time.  It is a gorgeous production shot in beautiful locations on the Mayan Riviera, one of the most sublime locations on the planet, filled with lovely supple bodies engaged in this ancient process.
Beyond the settings and the high production values is the heart of this DVD; splendid yoga instruction for people of all ages and levels of experience.  Paula Lieb is obviously a master level instructor, and using this DVD I have advanced my yoga well beyond the level possible through local instruction.  There is enough here to help me move forward for some time, and the closeups and slow instruction allows me to correct my postures accurately.
All in all an amazing contribution to the practice of this ancient art/science for everyone.  This will be the best $20 you have spent on yourself for some time!",1256083200,,1014,4.64245810055866

Fun, wonderful workout, creative, easy but powerful, great engery.
Nice pics of the mayan rivera too. Highly recommed for all levels of people practicing yoga.",1255392000,,320,9.03125
8371346,5,B002JB5ASU,"I know the settings in this presentation very well, and I feel that adding the meditative element of yoga to some of the more exotic locations of this region of the world give it a dimension second to none.  Don't miss this one!",1254787200,,228,4.3023255813953485
8371347,5,B002JB5ASU,I bought this video from Paula here in Playa del Carmen and it was perfect for me.  This is really a great video for all levels and with the Caribbean and Riviera Maya in the background it reminds me of being on vacation every time I watch it.,1254009600,,243,4.0625
8371348,5,B002JB5ASU,"The pacing of this well-constructed yoga class lets you dig deeply into the poses.
Paula Liebe's narration reminds us that breathing is the key to yoga and the effect is meditative and grounding. Mayan jungles, archeological sites and the Caribbean Sea provide a lush backdrop for her expert execution of the poses. Inspirational as it is beautiful to watch.
A well-balanced flow class suitable for students of all levels.",1253404800,,422,5.130434782608695
8371349,5,B002JB5ASU,"I bought this DVD from Paula when I was on vacation in Playa del Carmen. She is such a vibrant and passionate teacher and I'm grateful that I was able to bring some of that energy back home. Especially during those cold days in the big city I like to practice with her and see all those beautiful places again that I have visited during my trip to Mexico. My Mexican sister in law practices with me sometimes, because Paula's instructions come in Spanish as well. First I thought that her DVD was pretty strong, but she shows all kinds of modifications that allow all levels to participate. Thank you Paula for creating such a beautiful power yoga DVD.",1253232000,2,652,4.487394957983193
8371350,5,B002JB5ASU,"Pure excellence! This is the most artistically produced power yoga DVD I have ever seen, such a professional performance at so many different exotic locations. And the instructions come in Spanish as well. Five Stars for this spiritual piece of art !",1253145600,2,250,4.976190476190476
