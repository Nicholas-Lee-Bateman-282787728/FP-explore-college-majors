1712626,3,B000066C73,"It's not the best ""last man"" type genre but it has some really funny parts.  The sad thing is the guy doesn't know what he has until...won't spoil it for you.  Personally I don't know why they never moved into a hotel and got rid of the bodies.  Jeri Ryan was a surprise because I'd only really seen her in Voyager.  She can really act and never once did I think of her as Seven of Nine--which is saying something when she looks that good!  All the acting is great and the twists at the end, although not surprising, are wonderful to watch.  I'd recommend it and not recommend ""The New Guy"" DVD.",1042070400,9,595,4.221238938053097
1712627,5,B000066C73,"Some people (like the last guy) totally miss the point.  I saw this film in New York and while it was a low budget , it was a brilliantly funny.  The lead Arnot is terrific as an average schmoe who is left with this gorgeous woman (Jeri Ryan) who STILL doesn't like him, even though he is the last man on Earth!!  The film just shows that even if you wipe out every  one else and get things the way you want them,  the world can still suck (if you're an idiot loser).  It was very Albert Brooks like.  I guess it was over the head of some people, but it is totally smart, sharp and worth seeing.  And the soundtrack and quality are great.",1029369600,12,638,4.048
1712628,1,B000066C73,"This is a cheaply produced movie that manages to make all three actors look bad. I didn't think it was possible, but with either none or very poorly done makeup, even Jeri Ryan is unatractive.
The basic story idea probably is okay, but the characters are so self indulgent, the movie is very irritating. The video and sound quality are very poor. Don't waste your time or money.",1028160000,7,378,4.573529411764706

1712630,5,B000066C73,"Independently produced, writer/director Harry Ralston has created a truly original take on the ""Last Man on Earth"" concept.  This is a darkly comic movie that does an effective job of establishing the lead character dealing with profound loneliness (a fearless portrayal by David Arnott, who I believe co-wrote ""The Last Action Hero"") before introducing him, in the most comically embarrassing way possible to the ""last woman,"" played by Star Trek Voyager's JERI RYAN!  This movie never goes for the obvious joke, it's big laughs (and it has plenty) come from how Ralston realisticaly has his characters act and react to a very abnormal situation.  Great entertaintment.  BUY IT!",1023667200,6,679,5.2592592592592595

It kind of reminded me of a cross between Mark Twain and Andy Warhol.  That is a diverse universe to explore and I wish other things had been explored and done differently but it was a great call on humanity!

Abandonment, vanity, betrayal, all based in selfishness which is what humanity is all about.  The progression of each character was perfect and the element of karma was there because as Tony Stark said, ""We create our own demons!""!",1463097600,,593,4.462962962962963

1712715,2,B000066C73,"While Jeri Ryan manages to elevate this paint by numbers endeavor momentarily from entirely failed comedy, her efforts are not enough to keep it from tumbling down again immediately and often. It's a wonder why she would choose to be part of this flimsy screenplay 101 reject beyond what seems to be a bit of desperation to show she can act, even if it's a dud as a vehicle. 'The Last Man' tries too hard to be charming, which results in awkwardly falling short in almost every way a film can. Some sort of biological ""accident"" wipes out all human life on earth, except for a few, leaving the survivors in this beauty and the neurotic beast routine which has been done before and far better.  Basically the viewer is forced to witness the drawn out inevitable result of a beautiful woman sinking to lows as she feels apparently confused and religiously obligated to have a pity based relationship with the last man on earth, despite the fact he's also the world's most annoying creepily awkwardly obsessed dork-loser. Finally we get to watch her reject him, of course. If all this sounds like your idea of a fun evening, you're in for a treat. It's rather depressing in it's failed attempts to be quirky. I imagine with someone like a Seth Rogen as male lead and Woody Allen at the helm, this might have been a marginally better movie...actually nothing could improve this script. If you manage to suffer through what is a relentlessly swinging pendulum between un-funny infantile and truly sophomoric lameness in storyline, you'll find there is nothing to this transparent little bag of wind in the end.",1451779200,,1605,4.732142857142857

Traveling would not be near as easy as it was in the movie, there wouldn't be Electricity to pump fuel, or not for very long anyway. Eventually food would even become scarce, you would have to travel to find unaffected foods, if even possible, how would you test it, eat it you're self?
 I would be scared as hell !

Life is short, so I have a ""fifteen-minute"" or ""one chapter"" rule - if my attention isn't grabbed by then, I move on. Something about the dialogue and the main character stopped my fingers from hitting the pause button. I'm glad I didn't hit the pause button - this is not your typical  ""SHTF"" movie; nobody slashes any zombies with machetes, no rape, no bad guy, just a nerdy anthropologist trying to make sense of being left alone until he meets a gorgeous female - who eventually struggles with why the only man left is a nerdy anthropologist! I enjoyed the story so much I may watch it again. There were bothersome areas.....like, 1) Why did a store alarm go off if the power grid is down because there isn't anyone to maintain the power plant? 2) Why did he live waaaayyyy out in the desert in a motor home? Don't expect much drama, or violence. Do expect a good story, great acting, and  a quirky twist to the SHTF genre. I'm still smiling.

The humor comes from the fact that the woman is attractive but a little bit shallow & somewhat flighty.  The men are an educated but average looking moderately overweight guy and a good looking fit but not overly bright bro type guy.  Guess which one is the 3rd wheel.  One more fact, the original last man on Earth is the less attractive of the 2 men and also the narrator of the movie.  So you're seeing the events with your eyes, but described by the narrator.

This isn't a last man on earth movie as much as it is an exploration of male/female relationship stuff.  I normally don't go for that, but I thought it was pretty funny and well done.

I like how the hero of the story lacks the ability to really connect with Jeri Ryan.  I can relate.  When a woman is crying/ emotional/ vulnerable all I can  think of is Glen Quagmire's line from Family Guy.. I probably shouldn't write the line-- it had to do with his sack.  I really like how Jeri Ryan looks at him.  Her expression reminds me of the hopeless/trapped look Cheryl Hines always had in Curb Your Enthusiasm.  She really is a surprisingly good actress.

You have to watch this as a comedy/ satire because the characters' personalities are intentionally exaggerated.

The point was clear immediately, that he was getting his dream girl and she was getting a schumlp, but it was never really played up well.

Also, I tend to find that I disagree with more vocal reviewers fairly often and can usually manage to accept most entertainment at the value it is offered.  (And hey!  It had Jeri ""vavavavoom"" Ryan!)

On the surface, the most interesting thing about this movie was that Jeri Ryan chose to participate during the later years that she was also a Star Trek femme fatale.  This movie was released in 2000.  The same year that she made an appearance in Disney's ""The Kid"" with Bruce Willis and ""Dracula"" while simultaneously playing the role Seven of Nine on ""Star Trek; Voyager"" (1997-2001). (I won't even dignify the fact that she chose to slip her shirt off and display her nude back and the sides of her breasts early in this movie with more than this statement. (Seriously, Jeri?  For THIS movie?))

The idea was sound.  The classic stereotype of the quintessential nerd is the last man on earth with the type of girl that he worships from afar as the last woman.  (Hey, wait.  Didn't she say, 'Not even if you were...'?)  At least until the type of guy that has always overshadowed him shows up and they become the last THREE people on earth.

There were several humorous moments.  Although, I suspect that you have to BE one of those stereotypical social rejects to get some of the jokes.  (And male to get some of the others.)  However, after awhile, the humor wore off and became not even decent slapstick.  (Either that, or my pain meds wore off.  I'm not sure.)

In the end, I managed to watch one hour before I decided that I really just didn't care what the last thirty-three minutes might bring.  Perhaps it might have been different if there had been other people watching it with me... or at least Gypsy, Tom Servo, and Crow T. Robot heckling.  Or if I even suspected that we might find out something actually mildly interesting such as that Soylent Green is people.  But as it is, I just got to the point that no matter what might happen, I just didn't care.

I won't recommend this movie, but I won't tell you not to watch it either.  I would just suggest that it MIGHT be a little more entertaining with a few other people around you, at least one or more ""social reject types"" in the mix.  Oh, and some of those ""special mushrooms"" on the pizza.  It might, but I doubt it.

1712928,2,B000066C73,"Hypothetical situations abound, one-time director Harry Ralston gives us the ultimate post-apocalyptic glimpse with the world dead, left in the streets, in the stores, and throughout the landscape, sans in the middle of a forgotten desert.  One lone survivor, attempting to rekindle his sanity, takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert.  All alone, he hopes for more, but with nobody around, he is left with white underwear, and a passion for a local Indian tribe - until the discovery of a camera which opens up new doors and breaks the barriers of human co-existence.  Alan, a man of the book, is left on Earth after an unknown disaster.  Thinking he is alone, he begins living life his way - until, Jeri Ryan, appears (like she would in any dream) out of the woods, disheveled, and unhappy to find the final man alive to be ... well ... like Alan.  Anyway, they try to co-exist, fail, get drunk, and before creating the ultimate dystopia, they run into Redneck Raphael (played by newcomer - Dan Montgomery Jr).  Bonds are torn, confusion sets in, a couple becomes a third wheel, and the battle between physically inept nerd vs. brainless jock.  Even with nobody left on the planet, it becomes a truth that even the darkest of human nature will arise.

Using a variable film technique, Ralston gives us a mediocre story based loosely on another film entitled ""The Quiet Earth"" (which I will be viewing next) oddly which he never gives any credit towards.  With a borrowed story, I guess he does a decent job of reinterpreting it.  His punch seems to be lacking at the beginning while Ralston tries to find his stride, borrowing yet again from other film director's techniques to attempt to find his own.  He opens the film interestingly enough, but fails to answer any direct answers.  Sure, the final days have arrived, but could there be a concise answer as to ""how"" or better yet ""why"" these select few survived.  A spookier beginning would have led us stronger into a comical film.  The juxtaposition would have been like ""Shawn of the Dead"", but instead left us feeling like we were watching a ""made-for-TV"" program.  Listening to the audio commentary, I have respect for Ralston because he worked diligently to get this film made, and his passion nearly sells the film, but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he wasn't as happy with his overall final product.  There were mistakes, ones that he pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out.  While this does make for decent independent filmmaking, it sometimes feels cheap, and in Ralston's case, it was the latter.

I must admit, David Arnott's portrayal of Alan hooked me.  He played that wimpy, school nerd, adult role very well.  He was funny to both watch and listen to, and thus he became sympathetic to the viewer.  He was a key player in keeping the film together, alas, I cannot say the same for the rest.  This was Dan Montgomery's first film, and it was obvious - I mean - really really obvious.  There were scenes in which I thought the cue card was about to come out and read the lines for him, perhaps even giving us a more realistic performance, but alas, it wasn't the case.  Then there was Jeri Ryan.  She pulled into her character near the end of the film, which to me, was the culmination of the entire piece of art.  She goes from estranged unknown to bitter cranky insane girlfriend by the end.  Confused?  Again, she fell into her character by the end, giving us just a glimpse of what she could have probably done as her acting matured.  Even as the commentary progressed, all that she contributed was a laugh, giggle, or ""ohhh, look at that color"" moment.  While her beauty may sell tickets, one may want to consider knowledge to be just as beautiful.  This was her first film, so can I be too harsh?

Overall, this film felt like it was missing something.  I though the idea was strong - the premise that even with only a peppering of people remaining on the Earth the evil of human nature still exists.  Jealousy cannot be killed by bacteria or bombs (maybe because it is consumed by zinc?) and we as a race will always want what we cannot have.  Ralston is not a surprising director, his techniques are flawed and pre-used, but he does know how to make a low-budget comedy.  I think our idea of ""funny"" is different, so that is why I couldn't find myself laughing at many of the bits he found ""hysterical"".  His actors provided the level of acting needed for this film, which was lower than average.  His film was loose, meaning that there were elements never quite explained or tackled (i.e. anything with wings survived?!?), which overall harmed the intensity of the film.  This was a comedy, but it could have been much darker and much much funnier.  For those thinking that Roger Avery was a huge element to this film, as we learn from their commentary, all he was there for was money - the was in essence, the bank for ""The Last Man"".  Don't get your hopes up for any classic Avery moments.

Don't expect more from Ralston - and that is how I will end it.

1712932,4,B000066C73,"This is the type of film that creeps up on you, and you find yourself smiling at the end.  David Arnott is a steriotypical unattractive, intellectual geek...Jeri Ryan is the attractive woman with issues, and David Montgomery Jr. is the uneducated but handsome hiker...all survivors of a mysterious, unexplained plague that has wiped out human kind, who meet up at various stages.  Arnott is the narrator of this tale, as he video tapes his exploits and his personal accounts for any other survivors.
It's Arnott's performance that provides the tempo for this tale.  He plays on his character's faults, showing how a man might feel to have the world dumped in his lap, and become more and more annoyed when things don't work out exactly as he perceives they should....as in his relationship with Ryan.  The man now has his fantasy woman, but dealing with her individual emotions as a real human being is another story.  And then of course being confronted when a third, better looking male survivor unexpectantly shows up.
Jeri Ryan (who does not appear in the form fitting jump suit on the VHS cover) gives a deft performance as a woman with relationship issues (as she warns future generations in her video legacy against ""...women like me."")who wants to do the right thing, but just can't get past her obvious distaste for Arnott's physical and emotional being.  Ryan once again shows that her acting skills are not soley based on her wearing tight clothes, and you might be surprised by some of her raw, emotional outbursts.
And although Montgomery's character doesn't have much to do, he nails his part as  a fun loving guy who accepts the situation and let's nature take it course...as long as that course includes free drugs and a route into Ryan's pants.
Bottom line is you have a look at people who are given the world to start anew, and yet they just can't seem to kick the old habits and stereo-typed roles given to them by a society that no longer exists.  Arnott shows deft comic timing as he jumps from dealing with his fellow survivors and then telling his side to his video recorder ""audience"", which is pretty much the focal point of much of the action.  Don't expect gross out corpses or devastating scenes of dead cities or extreme violence...all the action takes place in what appears to be a desert area outside of California.

I tried my best to find out the artist so I could get the MP3 of the song but after trying Shazam and Soundhound neither one of them could identify it.  So if anyone is reading this and could help me find the name and artist of the song at the end of this movie (during the exiting credits) I would appreciate it by leaving a message.

7962314,5,B000066C73,"If there were better films in mainstream cinema, I would give this 4 stars, but since all things are relative, this gets 5 stars. Also, if you only like mainstream films you won't like this. This is a pretty low budget film that does really well in keeping the character moving along and humorously looking at human behavior. It was an interesting development of character, with the perception of who he is changing over time, and the meaning of his interests changing over time. It does well at showing how meaning changes when context changes, and how simple and messed up humans are, no one below being able to be nice to others, yet no one above being an a-hole as well. It also illustrates the  unfair reality of human nature in that physical appearance colors our experience and illicits emotions, regardless of how educated we are. In other words the characters are not flat and the film doesn't force you to think there is one type of person that demonstrates the correct way of being. In today's market of what films get funded for production, that is a huge accomplishment. It is intellectually anti-intellectual, if that makes sense... showing how stupid and selfish people are, regardless of level of intelligence. It's kind of fun watching the characters be unaware of their lack of insight, and the film lays things out so that you can see that but without being heavy handed. The only complaint I have is the last 10 seconds kind of flopped. I think they could've done a few more takes and made it come out better. This film does extremely well when considering its budget.  No action scenes, no grandiose explosions, no overblown melodrama. Also, it manages to be a post-apocalyptic film without relying on violence and/or zombies which is pretty unique. I'm not saying it is necessarily more or less accurate, but it does make the film interesting. Far better than a Mad Max ride in my opinion. The premise of his plans for the video he's making is a bit silly, but perhaps that is part of demonstrating the duality that the main character is both functioning on a higher level yet also oblivious and impractical on other levels.",1468540800,,2146,4.72
