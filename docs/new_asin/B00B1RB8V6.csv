5552358,5,B00B1RB8V6,"A highly fun and entertaining film made for anyone. A story involving all different people with all different kinds of powers. However, it's their choice on whether to use it for good or for bad. Here comes another fantastic and fun action-packed show with unlimited styles of humor too. One of the few animes with a fantastic story, fun music, and memorable characters who you'll never forget.

- I would give it easily 10/10. Easily one of the best made and most entertaining to watch.

- Enjoy it to the full!",1361404800,3,512,4.615384615384615

5552370,4,B00B1RB8V6,"I watch a lot of movies, but not really a lot of anime. There's been a few I've liked over the years, but I wouldn't consider myself an anime fan. All the major anime titles that have been recommended to me over the years weren't really to my taste (Akira, Ghost In The Shell, Neon Genesis Evangelion etc.). Someone recommended A Certain Scientific Railgun to me because I absolutely love Innocent Venus.

I'm a bit disappointed that the ""railgun"" refers to one of the character's abilities rather than an actual railgun, but nevermind. On the plus side though, this is a very atmospheric series and you really get a feel for what everyday life is like in this city. It's kind of like Harry Potter with schoolgirls -only much, much better. If you like the idea of a schoolgirl action/comedy, this is for you.

There's some ""adult"" moments, but it's all cartoonish and silly and it's nothing I would feel uncomfortable letting children watch if they're in the room at the same time.

Although I think the story drags at times (but let's face it, what series doesn't?) and personally I would like more action, some people are going to prefer the slower pace as if gives time to get to know the characters.

Personal preferences aside, there's definitely lots here to enjoy. I like it!",1411344000,,1282,4.65929203539823

5552372,5,B00B1RB8V6,"A spin off of A Certain Magical Index and heres my review

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) This is the side story of A Certain Magical Index, where instead of the story following Kamijo and Index it follows Mikoto Misaka and her friends. This takes places before the Certain Magical Index show takes place.

Pros: its good over all, I think its better than then magical index show that preceded it before because this one dosnt push the whole ""well its magic and everything is magical"" in your face as much.

Cons: I only watched 6 episodes so far but so far its pretty much better than the other show so I really cant tell you much more than I am now

Over all: buy this show!!",1407801600,,689,4.359375

But however the peace does not last long as a group called Skill out is going around attacking Esper students.  How is the group supposed to stop them when they have something that can affect Espers - including the mighty Railgun, and does one of their own have a connection with the leader of the group.  But of course everything is not all business, swimsuit modelling, festivals, and new friendships will develop - even when a new and more dangerous threat lurks in the shadows, with the missing children being the key to saving or destroying everything they know.

I liked this series, a good story with plenty of action and humor thrown in.  The characters really develop well and the story really flowed well.  a good watch",1374451200,4,824,4.7272727272727275

5552402,5,B00B1RB8V6,"If you enjoyed A Certain Magical Index then ACSR is going to blow your mind.  They basically take place at the ""same time"" but Railgun is a segue of time from everything that took place during ACMI.  (We get to hear Misaka called ""bug zapper"" a few times by Toma, so we know they've met and whatnot and there's another couple clues that let us know it's going on at the same time as the alternate movie but I won't spoil anything.)

Brittney Karbowski is already one of my favorite VA's - but what she brings to life in Misaka is truly beyond extraordinary.  She's one of the best protagonists I've seen across countless series...and that's saying something because that particular number crosses over the 4 digit mark; so I have a LOT to compare it to.  And still I can say ACSR is one of my favorites.  Throughout the entire series I was laughed hysterically, cheered on Misaka and her group friends, cried, trembled with anger, fear, sadness, gratitude and everything in between each emotion in the spectrum.  It touches on everything but doesn't linger in one spot; nor does it move across a point so quickly you don't even realize what just happened.  The recipe for storyline, characters, delivery, and artwork is truly one of the best I've ever watched.  And rewatched the moment it finished running the final episode.

The stories are fresh, the humor is great...and it's mature enough most ages (save for the perpetual advances from Kuroko which might be a bit much for anyone under 13 or so) will enjoy it and everyone's favorite ""Level 5 Esper"" is able to shock the fun and rewards into any viewer who will give it a chance!!  I pre-ordered and bought both parts, sight unseen...I've never made a better ""blind"" purchase for an anime title.  Not ever.",1369785600,3,1762,4.648387096774194
5552403,4,B00B1RB8V6,"The second set of Certain scientific Railgun Season 1 does not include the ova, unfortunately, so it is not a complete season set of Railgun when combined with Set 1. I haven't yet listened to the dub, but the voices are the same as Index Season 1's dub, which I thought was reasonable. Misaki's voice is lacking in emotional depth compared to the original Japanese voice actor, but no major complaints. This is a good series, with plenty of drama, comedy and action, and just a touch of romance. The omission of the ova and dvd/blu-ray specials is the main reason I give this only 4 stars instead of 5. The other reason is the lack of a blu-ray release in North America; Japan released the blu-ray, and it was aired in high definition, so Funimation is just being cheap. It doesn't cost that much more to release a blu-ray instead of a dvd, and Railgun should outsell Index.",1366761600,,875,4.509433962264151
5552404,3,B00B1RB8V6,"If you are interested in this series, chances are you have seen A Certain Magical Index. This is a spinoff of that show. While Index was a pretty good series, this one is average. It doesn't really have the dramatic flair or the great characters that Index had either. Railgun follows the daily life of Esper, Mikoto Misaka. When I say daily life, I mean exactly that. Her friends and her school life, with a little action from time to time. The most interesting people in Mikoto's life were Touma and Index. They only make a few short Cameos in this spinoff.

The series is divided up into several story arcs. A couple of them are mildly entertaining. One of Mikoto's friends gets hold of a device that can increase ones esper abilities. The problem is, it has a dangerous side effect. An unlikely character is also the culprit in this case. There is also an arc involving one of the Judgement members that works with Shirai (Mikoto's room mate), as she comes to terms with her past by fighting against a violent gang. Those are pretty much the highlights of the series.

This series isn't bad, it's just not all that good. The production quality is very solid. The voice acting, animation, and soundtrack are well done. The story just kind of drags. Most of Mikoto's time is spent hanging out with her friends and fending off her lesbian roommate. Even the action in this series is kind of mediocre. I recommend watching it online before buying and making your decision then. I hope that the 2nd season of Index comes out soon. Hopefully this was just an attempt to buy some time until then. As far as anime goes, A Certain Scientific Railgun will probably fall through the cracks unless the 2nd season kicks some major ass.",1366502400,4,1726,4.58252427184466

All in all cheap thicker cardboard case you see in picture is what you get for the limited edition

5552406,1,B00B1RB8V6,"Funimation's site only lists a dvd version, as with A Certain Magical Index Season 1 Parts 1-2, and according to their forums, Funimation doesn't even have the blu-ray rights for Railgun. Amazon is the only place that lists a dual audio Railgun blu-ray, and only for part 1. Other sites have only the dvds, both parts. This includes rightstuf. The only Railgun Blu-rays are the Japanese region A, which are not subtitled and have no English audio either. If I thought this were genuine, I would buy, but all the evidence indicates this is a huge mistake or a fraud. I checked carefully. And you know it's a bad sign when the company that makes it doesn't even list the product. I would have gladly bought the blu-ray if Funimation had released Index or Railgun that way, but they opted not to.

5552407,5,B00B1RB8V6,"This review is based off of the fan subbed anime, I won't be able to review the English voice acting for obvious reasons at the moment, I will most likely update this post once the DVD's are released.

This anime is a spin-off of ""A Certain Magical Index"" taking place in the same locale, Academy City, but focusing on one of the side characters from Index, Mikoto Misaka.

A little background for those who haven't seen ""Index"". Academy City is a place that focuses on the research and training of espers, or telekinetics. Everyone attending school here is ranked by their esper abilities from Level 0, no perceptible ability, to Level 5 which is so powerful, that only 7 out of the entire population of the city (2.3 million) have attained that level. This brings us to our heroine Mikoto who happens to be the 3rd highest ranked level 5 in Academy City.

Mikoto is a classic tsundere character, she is strong and protective of her friends, but has a very soft side loving anything cute. Her esper ability is to control electricity and she has a signature move called the ""railgun"" where she is able to super accelerate a coin using electricity.

The story itself is very whimsical and humorous for the most part, especially when you include Mikoto's amorous roommate Kuroko Shirai, a Level 4 teleporter, into the mix. Kuroko's sole mission in life is to ""get it on"" with Mikoto, where our heroine ends up resorting to electocuting Kuroko to fend of her advances.

There is one over arching theme dealing with Academy City and the Espers and several subplots that seamlessly tie into the main theme. The story writers do a great job of gradually leading the story from light-hearted to serious then once the climax of a sub plot is reached leading back into a whimsical, light-hearted episode.

This is a great watch and I look forward to seeing how the English voice actors portray the characters I've come to love in the original Japanese version.

As a side note, you do not need to watch ""Index"" to understand the story line, they do a great job of giving you all the background you need. I actually watched ""Railgun"" before I realized that it was an off-shoot of ""Index"", but after watching ""Index"" I understood some of the minor nuances they put into the anime, like characters from ""Index"" making cameo appearances.

If you're looking for some cool action scenes, good character development, some downright funny scenes and a well integrated story line, I would highly recommend you watch this Anime.",1361923200,16,2509,4.738532110091743
