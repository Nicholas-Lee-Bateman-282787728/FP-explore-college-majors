3504696,3,B001C4CI8A,"A decidedly deceptive trailer makes Ridley Scott's new covert operations film Body of Lies seem like a battle of wits between Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. But the film actually delves much deeper into the bedlam of undercover missions, double-crosses and sabotage, and deals nail-biting suspense at every turn. Although the story looks like fuel for a Tony Scott (Ridley's brother) film, ala Spy Game, the sheer intensity, violence, immediacy and realism of the cinematography has Ridley's signature all over it.

Based on David Ignatius' 2007 novel about CIA operative Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio), Body of Lies follows his undercover operations based around Iraq, Jordan (Amman), Dubai, Turkey, Syria, the U.S and more. Every move he makes is under aerial surveillance and the vigilant eye of Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe), his superior who continually yet unintentionally detrimentally interferes with crucial missions.

Every objective for Ferris is surrounded by side missions, conflicting intelligence gathering, and double-crosses from both his government and the Jordan secret police group headed by Hani (Mark Strong). As the media is manipulated along with everyone involved in the uncovering of terrorist bombings across Europe, Ferris invents a fictitious alternate terrorist brotherhood to ferret out Al Saleem, a treacherous man known to be involved with the majority of the anonymous attacks. As Hoffman works to preserve his agents' involvement and Hani feeds his own ego, Ferris is confronted with several shocking revelations and choices that could ultimately lead to the death of his newfound love interest as well as his own.

Body of Lies doesn't slow down to let the viewer catch up to all of the fast-talking political jargon, in-depth public opinion trajectory issues, and the guerilla warfare tactics employed by the allegedly unsophisticated enemy. If you miss something, you're on your own. But this breakneck pace coupled with relentless explosions and firefights, fierce chase sequences, grueling torture and continual brushes with death allows for blistering intensity and an experienced examination of suspense. Scott persists with plenty of close-ups that keep audiences on the edge of their seats, afraid of the next bullet or bomb that will certainly strike onscreen.

While the structure found within Body of Lies is one not unfamiliar to Scott's films, the flawless acting by both Crowe and DiCaprio paired with an intricate plot of trust and betrayal keeps the anticipation from ever backing down. A few of the twists may be predictable, but the deceptive motives of each character will keep you guessing their reactions until the unsettling conclusion. Body of Lies isn't Scott's best, but it certainly retains the finest elements of the masterful director's style, attention to detail, and cunning build of tension and suspense.

3504697,5,B001C4CI8A,"Films involving 'current events'--particularly those relating to anything happening in the Middle East and Terrorism--tend to be soaked in the writers', producers' and director's politics, which usually end up very much in-your-face and spoil the film, because you suddenly lose the story and drown in the preaching and proselytizing.

Ridley Scott, who has already addressed the West-East/Christianity-Islam issue in a previous film, 'Kingdom of Heaven', this time bit the bullet (instead of the sword) and continued KoH's story about 1000 years later. 'Body of Lies' is very much a Ridley Scott movie and this translates into the film's politics as well. Thing is, you can't leave politics out of a political movie; and so what do you do?

Well, here's a newsflash for the poli-preachers on all sides: it's possible to have it all, and just watch Ridley Scott do it. Just like KoH, it's all about even-handedness and realizing that (1) every side in a conflict has a point of view, which, to itself, is perfectly valid; and (2) every side has people you'd probably like and some you really wouldn't, (3) the way to peace lies with understanding (1) and (2); and not with having just one point of view, no matter how righteous it may appear. Both, Islamophobes and Islamophiles--or those on the extremes of any aspect of the political spectrum--will probably find ample elements to dislike about this film. Others of a more moderate and even-handed disposition will find much to like and appreciate.

All of this, rather profound, stuff is wrapped up in a gritty Ridley Scott production and direction, that keeps your full attention for its full 2+ hours. Leonardo DiCaprio has really grown up and cast off his annoying persona, which was so prominent in just about all his movies; until 'Blood Diamond' came along. Russell Crowe is basically a secondary character, eclipsed almost completely by DiCaprio and Mark Strong. The latter has come a long way since I first saw him in the BBC production of Jane Austen's 'Emma'. The gentle and understated romance element provided by Golshifteh Farahani as 'Aisha' provided a nice contrast to the testosterone-soaked male world in which this drama plays out.

The movie confirms what I've known for a long time: Ridley Scott apparently can do no wrong.",1223510400,7,2296,5.018372703412074

3504714,1,B001C4CI8A,"Bad movie, sorry I watched it.  Leonardo DiCaprio plays Roger Ferris, an amoral, lost, confused bad guy working for the CIA.  His boss is a detached, results driven anti-patriot (in other words he presents himself as being America, but has no American values).  There appears to be no mission, there appears to be no reason, no heroes, just a bunch of lawlessness and evil bad guys being evil and bad to pretty much everyone.  This appears to be the point of the movie, as Ferris' boss Ed Hoffman repeated says ""nobody's innocent"", presumably referring to his children and the victims of terrorist bombings (presumably, as they would be the only ones he would believe might be innocent).  Very disturbed reasoning, sick movie, goes nowhere, would only such a person would like this movie?  I only watched this movie hoping that something would turn around, or that the movie was trying to make some profound point, but nothing remotely like that is in this film.

3504717,5,B001C4CI8A,I watched this movie for the first time today August of 2017 and it seems as relevant now as it was when it was shot in 2008. I pray we have men and women like the characters played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Russel Crow out there but I know we have gone a different route with drones and computers doing the sum of our work now. There was a time we had men on the ground and doing a great job. I know it is a dirty business but the other guys have no rules at all. This movie is a Great example of how it was once done and why we can't get people to do it now. The plot is great and if you follow close enough you can see no one has trust in the next guy. This secret war will go on for a very long time. Well made movie the that gets the message acrossed.,1503532800,,755,3.725

Maybe I'm naive but I was on the edge of my seat. His acting is so good  here you become a part of the set . This one shows what a great talent he is (just like ""Gilbert Grape"" and ""This Boy's Life"". )

3504749,4,B001C4CI8A,"This is an efficiently directed, good-looking 2008 thriller that aims to tweak our conscience about what was going on in the Middle East as the ""war on terror"" was about 5 years in.  Roger Ferris (Leonardo di Caprio) is a CIA agent in the Middle East, working with local operatives, to forestall terrorist activities there and around the world, and he realizes how important to his mission these local operatives are and how deserving they are of his trust and respect.  His boss back at CIA HQ in Langley, VA is Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe), who directs operations from a distance and generally seems to feel that these local operatives -- and even, when push comes to shove, Roger himself -- are expendable assets in a global war that threatens Western Civilization itself.  At least, that's what we hear him tell HIS superiors, as he seeks funding and permission to continue his work.  Does he believe it? Or is it just rhetoric?  Is he -- as Roger suspects -- totally detached from the human costs of the war and more of a technocrat with drones and helicopters at his disposal than anything else?  Quite frequently, he undermines Roger'sinitiatives in the name of some ""larger"" purpose.

When Roger is wounded and sent to Amman, Jordan to recover and establish a new base of operations, his life becomes more complicated when he has to work with Jordanian intelligence and its chief, Hani Salaam (Mark Strong).  Hani seems detached in a different way from Hoffman, but there's no doubt that his way of working depends on trust and honesty.  Roger clearly is drawn to him. but the connection to Ed Hoffman gets in the way of his being able to convince Hani of his total reliability.  Hoffman and Hani, of course, know one another, and Hani doesn't trust Hoffman and Hoffman arrogantly assumes that what America (i. e. Hoffman) wants is what will be done, no matter what Hani and even Roger think is better in particular situations.  The heart of the movie is the psychological and emotional dynamic among the three men, and all three actors give strong performances, with Hani remaining, until late in the game, a bit of an enigma.  Effectively gripping, then, and morally engaging.  Viewers will have to decide for themselves whether or not the move makes ""entertainment"" of a horrible -- and ongoing, as of 2016 -- situation.  There are certainly generic ""thriller"" elements, but thanks to the actors, something more comes through.",1480204800,,2435,4.822115384615385

Stop wining Leo.

3505015,3,B001C4CI8A,"There's a lot to this movie you have to take as a given. Di Caprio's character, who is presented in the middle of an ""op,"" gets introduced when his native counterpart is killed. This is supposed to introduce the underlying theme of a) expendability of native assets, as opposed to American ones and b) the insincerity of American claims to support and nurture informants who give aid to the Americans. Which is true and c) the importance of in country, boots on the ground intelligence to successfully ""wage"" the war on terror, in the middle east. Di Caprio's boss is  a cheesesteak eating soccer Dad, who interrupts his children's bedtime rituals to direct Di Caprio's character in Iraq from roughly ten thousand miles away, in Langley, Virginia, the headquarters of the CIA. The divide is repeatedly emphasized by juxtaposing Di Caprio's presence as a CIA operator in dusty, filth ridden Iraqi buildings with Hoffman, (Crowe) licking ice cream from his fingers and giving him directions from  a comfortably air conditioned building, somewhere in Virginia. All in all a laudable theme to pin the story on, but the tools used to portray the narrative for me, felt contrived. The first feel was, five minutes in to the film, ""hey, you understand we're moving fast here, keep up with the stylish narrative pace, here we're in Aman, here we're in Jordan- here there are black lincoln Navigators filled with ominous men with oakley shades and hidden weapons moving in convoy. It all seemed to rely on stock icons of anti-terrorist imagery, which flowed seamlessly from one jet landing at an airport to another. Little room to breathe, to absorb the clarity of plot points in a way to allow the tension to mount  in a clear, literal way. . No, this was more like, ""hey, keep up, can't you see what's happening here? the Underlying Themes? the Operative gone Native? The Juxtaposition of Western technology with the feral cunning of the hunted? Are you a real movie buff? Very modern. One thing, though. When the screenwriter used the trope of ""good guy unaware of imminent discovery by bad man"" to create tension- or the typical zombie trope- ""car won't start, zombies (terrorists, bad guys) are coming, the mechanics of the script started to show through the scenery. My disbelief became un-suspended. However, the story itself, apparently modeled on real events is certainly worth telling and the moral judgment will most likely outlive the movie.",1412985600,5,2444,4.927184466019417

3505043,4,B001C4CI8A,Dicaprio and Crowe work off each other very well. Acting excellent for all. Fast paced. Watched a few times to find out new things. Improbable ending with Dicaprio giving up his CIA badge and staying in Jordan. He cover was blown and he wouldn't survive in the environment. How would he earn a living? The CIA would not let one of their own just remain in Jordan but would pull him out as he surely would be tortured for secrets. Better ending needed. As for Crowe he has let himself get too heavy. Hair cut a distraction and his acting is too unconcerned and that bothered me.  But the gist of the movie was well-done.,1404691200,,619,4.3826086956521735

But the Leo's love interest (if we can call it that) plays into the main plot midway through the movie and it ends up playing a big role in the overall plot/climax. I found that strange and a bit cheesy. Also, Russell Crowe's character seemed odd to me. Are top CIA guys always on their hands-free mobile sets at their children's soccer games/schools ""saving civilization""?

Russell Crowe is fantastic as a southern accented spy chief who orders his people into deadly situations via cell phone while calmly driving his kid to school or relaxing on the patio.

3505109,4,B001C4CI8A,"Cold War over since 1990. Behind the Iron Curtain scenarios out of date. There is no more Iron Curtain (so labelled first by Winston Churchill in 1946). This is Arab Terrorism vs. the CIA and its Arab allies and enemies. Nobody is to be trusted. Not only hidden political sympathies but also personal ambition can  turn an apparent friend into an enemy, and enemy to friend. This is one fine picture of the many that are coming off the assembly line to fit the new circumstances, circumstances which can never fully be understood by those involved with them much less the casual onlooker. I don't have anything resembling an understanding of the multiple political, religious, social, economic revolutions rocking the Muslim world, a vast territory stretching from the shores of Spain (once under Moorish domination) to the islands of Indonesia. So I can enjoy, as I did this movie, this Entertainment (in Graham Greene's word) without trying to judge how close it comes to any reality. It possesses a fiction's reality, one that can be accepted for the duration of the movie, and that is all that matters. Aside from a tight script and exotic (though not romantic) settings,  it does have budding love which serves to create the coda for the film. I probably have seen the two stars in a few things but have no memory of what they were;  here, they contribute an admirable quality to the proceedings. Possibly, Crowe overdoes his role of the cynical ""Chief"" under whom Agent DiCaprio serves. I think, however, it was what the film's creators wanted to say with that role. Supporting players were quite good, with the young woman playing DiCaprio's friend conveying an air of experienced innocence which was fitting to the role.
Action and drama fans should take to the movie, the squeamish will only have a few minutes of brutality, for the rest, it is the Old Spy Game. If you like that type of film, you should like this one. (As a footnote, one hopes that we do not, once more, fall into the trap of suspecting all Muslims or Arabs living in the West of nefarious behavior or support of it.)",1379548800,2,2095,4.718579234972678

3505129,5,B001C4CI8A,"""Body Of Lies"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: A CIA operative, Roger Ferris, uncovers a lead on a major terrorist leader suspected to be operating out of Jordan. When Ferris devises a plan to infiltrate his network, he must first win the backing of cunning CIA veteran Ed Hoffman and the collegial, but perhaps suspect, head of Jordanian intelligence. Although ostensibly his allies, Ferris questions how far he can really trust these men without putting his entire operation--and his life--on the line.

The cast led by Academy Award Nominee Leonardo DiCaprio (as Roger Ferris) & Academy Award Winner Russell Crowe (as Ed Hoffman) is excellent! This is the second time that DiCaprio and Crowe teamed up, the first being ""The Quick And The Dead"" (1995). The directing by Ridley Scott (who also produced with his production company, Scott Free, which produced said films in this sentence) (in his fourth go-round with Crowe, their fifth teaming will possibly be the upcoming ""Nottingham"" (2009), he also directed ""American Gangster"" (2007, also with Crowe and fellow Academy Award Winner Denzel Washington), ""Gladiator"" (2000, also with Crowe), ""A Good Year"" (2006, also with Crowe), ""Hannibal"" (2001), ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001), ""Kingdom Of Heaven"" (2005), & ""G.I. Jane"" (1997) is excellent! The screenplay (which is based on David Ignatius' novel) by William Monahan (who also wrote the screenplay to ""Kingdom Of Heaven"", ""The Departed"" (2006, for which he won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay and which also starred DiCaprio), & the upcoming ""Edge Of Darkness"" (2009, which stars Mel Gibson & Ray Winstone, who worked with DiCaprio and Monahan on ""The Departed"") is excellent!

The cinematography by Alexander Witt (he directed ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" (2004), he also did second unit director work on films, such as the upcoming ""The Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time"" (2010) & ""The Taking Of Pelham 123"" (2009, which also stars Washington & directed by Ridley's brother, Tony) (also director of photography: second unit), he also did ""American Gangster"" (also director of photography: second unit), ""Casino Royale"" (2006, also director of photography: second unit), ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl"" (2003, also director of photography: second unit), ""The Italian Job"" (2003, also director of photography: second unit), ""Daredevil"" (2003, also director of photography: second unit), ""XXX"" (2002, also director of photography: second unit), ""The Bourne Identity"" (2002, also director of photography: second unit), ""Black Hawk Down"" (also director of photography: second unit), ""Hannibal"" (also director of photography: second unit), ""Remember The Titans (2000, which also starred Washington and was also director of photography: second unit), & ""Gladiator"" (also director of photography: second unit), he also was a camera operator: second unit on ""Thelma & Louise"" (1991, which was also directed by Scott), & was a camera operator on ""Black Rain"" (1989, which was also directed by Scott) is excellent!

The music by Marc Streitenfeld (who also did the music to ""American Gangster"" & ""A Good Year"") is excellent! The film editing by Pietro Scalia (who also did the film editing to ""American Gangster"", ""Black Hawk Down"" (for which he won the Oscar for Best Film Editing), ""Hannibal"", ""Gladiator"", & ""G.I. Jane"", he also did the film editing to ""The 11th Hour"" (2007, which DiCaprio produced, wrote, and narrated) & ""The Quick And The Dead"") is excellent! The casting by Jina Jay (who also did the casting to ""A Good Year"", ""Kingdom Of Heaven"", & the upcoming ""The Lovely Bones"" (2009) & ""Nottingham"") & Avy Kaufman (who also did the casting to ""American Gangster"" & ""Baby Mama"" (2008) is excellent! The costume design by Janty Yates (who also did the costume design to ""American Gangster"", ""Gladiator"" (for which she won the Oscar for Best Costume Design), ""Hannibal"", & ""Kingdom Of Heaven"") is excellent!

The production design by Arthur Max (who also did the production design to ""American Gangster"", ""Black Hawk Down"", ""Gladiator"", ""Kingdom Of Heaven"", & ""G.I.

There's the usual tension between young subordinate man on the scene and an old boorish boss far away, a very poorly scripted romance between Ferris and nurse Aisha, and far too many Arabic names and faces. (Yes, most of them look alike to me.) Then just in case you're not already bored stiff, there's political posturing and preaching thrown in. At the end Ferris throws away his CIA career and remains in Jordan to be with his honey - just one more in the film's collection of worn-out themes.

3505205,3,B001C4CI8A,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was the ""Body of Lies"" DVD which I picked up at a nearby Ross Store. It was one of those Middle Eastern things (Iraq centered) with a lot of intrigue, death and destruction and all deeply involved with the CIA. Leonardo DiCaprio played an agent situated where the action was whereas Russell Crowe, his main CIA contact, lived back in Fat City (CIA headquarters in Washington) in comfort with his wife and kids. They contacted back and forth through airline flights and ultra-high-end media connections.

It was an intriguing movie, and gave interesting insights to the CIA capabilities, if there is any truth at all to the movie. It also went a long way in explaining the size of the CIA budget. The movie flited around geographically from place to place to the point of confusion, although seeing various parts of the Middle East was interesting in itself. The language, particularly associated with DiCaprio, was hampered with the excessive use of F-speak, which added zero to the story and give the film a low-class patina. Be prepared for a certain amount of brutality. A romantic touch was present, but absolutely minimal. Death and destruction were everywhere, including some really spectacular explosions. The movie must have had a high-end budget. There's a lot of action, action, action and boredom never set in, well perhaps a little here and there. The story was not particularly interesting, nor believable, nor well done, however. The script could have used a lot of extra effort. The acting was excellent, however, and the photography and sound were quite good. It was a movie with very mixed qualities.

The quality of this Blu-Ray is excellent, both with the audio and the video. The video was 10/10; great.  All Blu-Rays should be this good.

After loading, the movie began - in Dolby Digital 5.1.  I had to go through the menus to change it to Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  There's probably not much difference - I just think it should have played originally in TrueHD, since I have the player connected to my receiver with HDMI.

I played this on a Sony BDP-S360, and didn't have any problems.  Then I took it to the bedroom to see if it would play on my older player, a Sony BDP-S350, and it played without any problems.  I don't know what problem the other reviewer had with his BDP-S350.  I have never updated the firmware on either player.

It's not the best Ridley Scott movie, even though by now he should be very comfortable with Crowe. And he's certainly had enough experience making movies set in a middle eastern milieu, be it modern or medieval. No, what makes the movie work is Mark Strong as the chief of Jordanian security.  He's got the accent down and he's got the upper-crust, middle eastern sense of superiority and entitlement down.

No matter what happens, it is only a matter of time before DiCaprio gets screwed.
DiCaprio wants to establish trust with the anti-terror unit he works with, so he can eventually nail the top terrorists.  But Crowe is too impatient, and will take any risk, abuse any relationship and burn any asset for a quick result that he can show off to the big boss to boost his career, even if it means getting his own agents killed.
It is a very revealing look at how a US agency works, very realistic and a great eye-opener. But the plot gets muddled and the ending is a bit anti-climatic.",1296691200,2,858,4.607843137254902

Following a CIA operative in the middle east who is trying to track down a terrorist this film has enough twists and turns to keep you interested, but not so many that you are left confused and asking too many questions as you go through. This film is very well directed by Ridley Scott and is also very well written; it makes certain points about the Iraq war without ramming them down your throat, which is rare from Hollywood and infinitely preferable to being spoon-fed. There are explosions enough for action fans, espionage and intrigue for thriller fans, political machinations for the more machiavellian and some romance for the softer side in us. All in all a good balance. This film tries to show Americas superior technology and ability to watch who it wants, when it wants, but that may just be good film propaganda and beneficial to the storyline. I tend to take it with a pinch of salt at least. Overall this was a good, but not great, political/spy thriller and the performance from Leonardo alone makes it worth watching. Check it out.

This film is very well directed by Ridley Scott and is also very well written; it makes certain points about the Iraq war without ramming them down your throat, which is rare from Hollywood and infinitely preferable to being spoon-fed. There are explosions enough for action fans, espionage and intrigue for thriller fans, political machinations for the more machiavellian and some romance for the softer side in us. All in all a good balance. This film tries to show Americas superior technology and ability to watch who it wants, when it wants, but that may just be good film propaganda and beneficial to the storyline. I tend to take it with a pinch of salt at least. Overall this was a good, but not great, political/spy thriller and the performance from Leonardo alone makes it worth watching. Check it out.

3505219,3,B001C4CI8A,"The story hooks you and keeps your attention.  The characters are nicely contrasted, from monotone to compelling.  The direction and cinematography are outstanding.  It is for those reasons alone you should watch the movie because beyond that the story never quite lives up to its potential.

What you see is what you get right from the beginning of the movie; everyone is manipulating everyone else.  The plot twists are numerous but not surprising, lacking the wow factor that a political thriller should have in abundance.  The movie builds your anticipation to a point and keeps it there, never delivering the gut punches that would leave you reeling from an unanticipated visual left hook.  Knowing that fact in advance you can enjoy the movie for exactly what it presents; an interesting Middle East story that is a little too careful to avoid offending the wrong people.

Mark Strong presented the most enjoyable character portrayal as head of the Jordanian intelligence service.  Leonardo DiCaprio was his usual self.  And then there was Russell Crowe.  His name was the only real contribution to the film because his character and delivery were unremarkable.  I can think of a half dozen other actors better suited to the role; maybe they were busy.

There are Blu-rays and DVDs you purchase for a small fortune where you feel viewing after viewing it was money well spent.  Yeah, this ain't one of those.  Body of Lies at $10 for a Blu-ray or $1 to $6 for a used/new DVD is priced just right to enjoy the movie.",1295481600,2,1521,4.818532818532819
3505220,4,B001C4CI8A,"These movies are the scariest horror movies of all time. Watching this, the Kingdom, Green Zone, etc the one thing that always jumps out at me is how much poverty and despair there are in this world that Americans are largely shielded from - it blows my mind. Here I'm thinking about getting more hours at work - they are wondering when they are going to be blown to pieces.. sure the movies may heighten that aspect, but for all intents and purposes I think they are closer to the truth than a lie.

Body of Lies itself is a real winner. I'm starting to think Leo Di cannot be a focal character in a movie I won't love - his track record for me is so damn stellar. The movie feels like two movies in one - the first half focus's on the known safe house of Al-Saleem to which I thought was the stronger aspect; everything felt very organic and had a somewhat 'you are there on location' feel. The second half (once they lose the safe house) - the 'orchestrating' of a terrorist group to draw out Al-Saleem felt highly improbable, something more akin to a Bond film - but still with Leo Di at the helm I somehow felt I too could create my own terrorist network out of spamming a Yahoo account, lol...

The romance. Loved it. Superb performances with real chemistry by Leo and ""Aisha"". Russell Crowe was about the only thing that felt a bit ""off"" in Body of Lies.. It's obvious he tried to fatten up for the role, different hair color, etc - but under all that I still see a Gladiator, lol.. it's not that he wasn't at least partially convincing, it's that as a viewer I don't really want to have to struggle too hard to distance myself from an actor and a role they aren't typically in - so this could be my bias - but if you threw Philip Seymour Hoffman into this role he would have melded right in as opposed to being forced into it. It should be noted -  Mark Strong gave a strong performance;)

All in the all the transfer too was superb..",1290297600,,1942,4.2405405405405405
3505221,3,B001C4CI8A,"Like some of the other three-star reviews here, I will note that the movie is actually not bad at all, it's just that we have seen it before, meaning, we have seen several films that are remarkably similar. The acting by Crowe and DiCaprio are excellent, and the story is mostly interesting, and at times, even plausible. There's just no originality to the story.  Plus, I'm really tired of movies about bad guys in the Middle East.",1288310400,,432,4.6103896103896105
