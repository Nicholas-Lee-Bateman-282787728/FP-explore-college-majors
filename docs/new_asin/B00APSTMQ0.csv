8555806,5,B00APSTMQ0,"While it's nice that this great doc finally exists on some sort of DVD, the large, forced German subtitles, and less than great quality of transfer still make my old VHS tape the best version of this I've been able to find.  Which is sort of absurd.  Time for Criterion, or someone, to step up (unless this is tied up by the dreaded 'rights issues'.

My old revue of that tape...

The filmmakers spending months with runaway teens on the streets of Seattle, to gain their trust and allow them to be filmed.

There is something oddly 'stagy' about some of the behavior. The kids are clearly aware of the camera. Yet, as one critic pointed out, that's also part of the power of the film, since adolescence has so much posturing and acting out anyway.

The film tries to stay un-judgemental and avoids commentating in obvious ways, sometimes at the expense of seeming disconnected or uncomfortable voyeuristic.

Yet there are moments of tremendous power here, both in seeing these kids cling to what bits of joy they can find, and to each other, and in seeing the grim realities of both their street and home lives, in hard-to-believe detail. A variable film, but a special, important one.",1450656000,,1186,4.673076923076923
8555807,5,B00APSTMQ0,"Thankfully the Germans release a number of American films no longer (or never before) pressed in the US on DVD or Blu-ray. In this particular case, the Angelika Films release has giant hardcoded [you can't turn them off] German subtitles. Is this still better than watching the movie for free on YouTube? It depends on your preference; since I can't stand low resolution video, I'm willing to put up with the subtitles.

As for the movie, it sticks with you. I saw Streetwise at an arthouse cinema in the 80s when I was an East Coast teen; it was my first exposure to the city of Seattle, where I now live. Three decades later, I still had some memory of the scenes before rewatching.
Looking into the fate of the characters this year, I was sad to find out that not long after this was filmed, Lou Ellen ""Lou Lou"" Couch was killed (stabbed in the heart, ironically). The term ""superhero"" comes to mind in describing a woman who wasn't afraid of men, one who tried to defend other women from exploitation and abuse. Unlike blockbuster superheroes in the cinema who always win, she met an untimely fate. Some of the kids in Streetwise seemed like they were ""acting"" because they knew a camera was rolling; Lou Lou was genuine, and it so happened that some of this was captured on film.",1443139200,3,1284,4.5344827586206895
