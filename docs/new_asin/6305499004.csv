7890497,5,6305499004,"We are mad fans of Degrassi High.  Not only did we take over the identities of the characters of the show, we assigned them to all of our friends. Unfortunatly we only have a select number of episodes recorded on VHS. We are in desperate need of the entire library. We've gone as far as choregraphing an entire dance number to the theme song.  We as well have buckets full of cartooned reenactments of the show drawn by myself Desiree aka Bronco and Christine aka Wheels aka Derrik. We've even tried contacting WKAR-TV in East Lansing, MI. All attempts have failed. We are not giving up hope. We would like any additional information anyone should have regarding the characters whereabouts--especially Neil Hope and Dean Ifill.  It has been a dream of ours for many years to contact them.  Please e mail us with any Degrassi related (Degrassi High, Street, and Junior High. We are looking for the box set on the black market. E-mail address-carn02@hotmail.com. Thank you we can see we're not alone we can face the unknown, everbody can succeed in themselves you must believe give it a tryyyy at Degrassi Hiiigh.",979948800,,1111,4.740932642487047
7890498,5,6305499004,"This was and still is one of the most unique shows.  Canadian drama at it's best.  They weren't afraid of what other people would think.  They  tackled teen pregnancy in jr high, abortion, aids, depression, suicide,  disease which is everyday life.  There was no sugar coating, what you see  is what you get.  It is said that Aaron Spelling tried to buy the rights to  the show and when they refused wanting to keep the roots in Canada along  came 90210, which is a far cry from Degrassi. My health teacher had  recorded the shows off of television and used many of the episodes as  teaching materials.  Growing up with Degrassi was definately a great time,  and I will always cherish the memories.  Even acclaimed film director and  writer Kevin Smith(a creative genius himself) admits to an obsession with  Degrassi. Everyone can and will enjoy these shows it is almost guarenteed.",967766400,3,883,4.741721854304636
