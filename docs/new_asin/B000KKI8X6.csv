2693120,4,B000KKI8X6,"I really enjoyed looking at both cultures , the Muslims and the Jewish folks that seem pretty simulare . I hated the ending.",1447286400,,124,4.434782608695652
2693121,4,B000KKI8X6,This is a really beautifully drawn picture of a most difficult situation--love between people of different religions.  It is neither preachy nor predictable.  The other inter-personal relationships depicted were both well thought out and fully developed.  The only reason to not give a fifth star is the fact that it was a little slow moving.,1447027200,,342,5.181818181818182
2693122,4,B000KKI8X6,Educative.,1443139200,,10,10.0
2693123,5,B000KKI8X6,"Subtle, slow burn story of love between a philosophical young Tunisian Jewess and her Muslim coworker in Paris. Not a film for those who need chase scenes and billboard plot lines, but really well suited for those who love to inhale nuance.",1435104000,2,240,4.738095238095238
2693124,5,B000KKI8X6,"A simple story beautifully shot and well acted.

A girl from an close knit orthodox Jewish family in Paris falls for a mysterious, quiet Arab man.

It's familiar territory, but done so sensually, and with such rich sense of detail that it feels completely fresh. A glimpse into a closed off world, where people cling to traditions in both fear and pride, leading to an almost incestuous over-involvement in each other's lives.

Great use of close-up image throughout, adding texture, and intimacy. That rare film that gives such a sense of place it's like you can smell the air of the rooms of the family's apartment.",1434412800,,617,4.80188679245283
2693125,4,B000KKI8X6,"Nowadays story of conforming the traditional believes while following natural urges and lust unleashed on a screen explicitly during last decades of a sexual revolution, human rights achievements and HIV invasion, is filmed in a Jewish quarter of modern Paris (regrettably, I had found neither profoundly Jewish subway line nor a district in situ, also some areas were still really, visually, more predominantly Hasidim-inhabited), mitzvah counseling, anti-Semitism on rise, exodus from and a loyalty to a country one lives in.

Interference with ""a boy from the Musk"", an Algerian journalist illegally residing in France at mercy of traditional parents, adds a pepper to a story of ready-for-marriage philosophy student's sexual desires.

Although both contextually and visually modern Israeli topic-related movies are much more graphic, a viewer would have been attracted with a female charm of actresses performing.

This work is interesting for broadening knowledge of a contemporary French Jewry.",1185667200,2,1001,5.704697986577181
2693126,5,B000KKI8X6,Well done. Good acting and story.,1468454400,,33,4.666666666666667
2693127,1,B000KKI8X6,The poster is very misleading if you're looking for a steamy romance movie.,1467158400,,75,4.846153846153846
2693128,1,B000KKI8X6,I did not like the movie it was kind of confusing. At what happens in the end was not sure what the plot was about. It's about a Jewish girl and Arab man who meet at work and fall in love.,1465948800,,188,3.6097560975609757
2693129,1,B000KKI8X6,Kinda cultural view entertainment wise of Jewish life these days.,1464739200,,65,5.6
2693130,2,B000KKI8X6,"Somewhat cliched, somewhat improbable but interesting premise. Gives a bit of insight into the orthodox lifestyle and problems/restrictions.",1464307200,,140,6.833333333333333
2693131,3,B000KKI8X6,"Interesting to see the culture, but unsatisfied at the end.",1462838400,,59,5.0

2693133,5,B000KKI8X6,Very much enjoyed.  Differences in culture and the choice whether to give up your beliefs for love.,1457222400,,99,4.823529411764706
2693134,4,B000KKI8X6,Fantastic depiction of the sensitivities of immigrant communities in current France. I would've loved to have a little more detail on the relationship between the two lovers. Overall a great movie.,1455580800,,197,5.387096774193548
2693135,2,B000KKI8X6,Love across different religions. A convoluted drama in a typical parisian suburb inhabited by Maghreb imigrants. Difficult to swallow.,1454976000,,134,6.105263157894737
2693136,2,B000KKI8X6,Cinema trying to be relevant again? Yawn,1454544000,,40,4.857142857142857
2693137,3,B000KKI8X6,Many aspects of filming well done but story line at end made no sense,1454457600,,69,4.0
2693138,3,B000KKI8X6,"This movie is well acted, but Amazon Prime's collection of foreign moves is far too narrow in range. For both French and Hebrew movies, it would be nice to have a good selection of subjects other than the challenges of orthodox lifestyle in a diverse society.",1454198400,2,259,4.6521739130434785
2693139,5,B000KKI8X6,Good movie.,1452988800,,11,5.0
2693140,4,B000KKI8X6,"Good movie, frustrating that there was no clear ending!  I guess this way I could create my own!",1449100800,,96,4.333333333333333
2693141,2,B000KKI8X6,Poor video quality and very slow moving.  Never finished watching,1449014400,,65,5.5
2693142,4,B000KKI8X6,Very intriguing film about love outside of the Jewish and Arab experience.,1449014400,,74,5.25
2693143,3,B000KKI8X6,Fanny Valette does a good job with the ambivalence and inner conflict of trying to navigate through will / humanism / philosophy vs. religion / tradition / obligation. Aspects of her love relationship seemed (to me) to be poorly supported by the script and also by the weak acting (and poorly written role) of her love interest.,1448582400,,328,4.771929824561403

8157735,1,B000KKI8X6,"Terrible film filled with sin and lust. Conflicts everything about who God truly is. Did you know that if you take the words from Psalms 81 or multiple other chapters in psalms and translate it back into the Hebrew note for that word, Gods word becomes a musical Symphony?!?Each hebrew word has a picture, a number, a musical note, etc. Gods word is beautiful, although man has changed it and perverted the word of God, just like this movie. Seek and you will find the true God.",1520640000,,478,4.505747126436781
8157736,5,B000KKI8X6,"Who knew? I was unaware of the Orthodox Jewish Tunisian immigrant community populating a small town on the outskirts of Paris. That's a key contextual element, but there's so much more, including 2 women's search for religion's endorsement of sexual pleasure.  Laura (Fanny Valette), the protagonist, a student of philosophy, attempts to supplant libidinal pleasure with Kantian philosophy and commit to a celibate life. You'll see how that goes. There's also an intercultural passion pairing. The film offers a unique fresh spin on the cultural and cross-cultural theme, punctuated with a bit of Old Testament views on female sexuality.",1503100800,,637,5.434343434343434
8157737,2,B000KKI8X6,"This film is very character driven and is centered around a Jewish family in France, particularly two women, sisters, of the family. One is torn apart between being true to her upbringing or following the belief system of philosophy. The other sister is conflicted about desire and passion within marriage while remaining faithful to the laws of the Jewish faith. The film is somewhat disjointed and hard to follow at times, at least to me. Yet, I was bewitched by Little Jerusalem enough to sit through the whole entire film.",1500681600,,526,4.855555555555555
8157738,3,B000KKI8X6,"Two sisters in a religious household struggle with sexual desire and pleasure.  One, married with four children is deeply religious, but naively supposes that she should not desire sex or enjoy it.  Ironically, she learns to enjoy herself in order to keep her husband.  The other, a student of philosophy, aims to imitate Kant in order to quell her desire for an Arab coworker.  She is unsuccessful, but eventually comes to see that her boyfriend will never be able leave his own culture.  The film resists condemning religion.  Ironically, all the men have so much respect for the women that the latter struggle with their fulfillment.  In this the film is a bit retro.",1488758400,2,670,4.824561403508772
8157739,5,B000KKI8X6,The cover and blurb for this film is an affront to the film itself. It is deeply thoughtful and themes run in complex ways throughout.,1480636800,,134,4.4
8157740,4,B000KKI8X6,Very beautifully done but the story is limited.,1479772800,,47,5.0
8157741,5,B000KKI8X6,"The sensual tension between two people leads to a crossing-over of sorts when the two crumble beneath the crushing weight of the same tension. Beautiful story that underscores the primal force of love and attraction over reason and law.

Magnificent!",1479427200,,250,5.25
