But at least now I have that season on DVD so I can watch it and share it with friends whenever I feel like it.  Now the mundane stuff...  Fast shipping, good price.

I found it to be a great satire

Wished it had another season",1428019200,,78,3.875
8577327,5,B00C4XV5AU,"I love Wedding Band!!! I think the reason this series failed because of lack of publicity (it was air on Saturdays night while we all know that weekends night are the days for musician to go to work). Many ""bands"" in real life who would enjoy this series as much as I do, do not know this series at all.",1419292800,,303,4.066666666666666
