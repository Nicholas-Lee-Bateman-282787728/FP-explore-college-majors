740521,5,6303957005,"Tales of Manhattan is a star-studded movie that featured 46 supporting players as well as a main cast including Charles Boyer, Rita Hayworth, Ginger Rogers, Henry Fonda, Charles Laughton, Edward G. Robinson, W.C. Fields, Paul Robeson, Ethel Waters, and Eddie Rochester Anderson.  A film like this could never be made today because each star would demand so much money that the budget would be so high.
The film begins when a tailor and his assistants bring a tailcoat to the apartment of stage actor Paul Orman (Charles Boyer). They then inform him that the cutter put a curse on the suit, but he assures Mr. Ormans that it will bring him happiness.
Pauls next play is a smash hit, but he leaves as soon as he takes his bow. He tells Luther (Eugene Pallette), his servant, to drive him to Ethel Halloways (Rita Hayworth) home. He is in love with her, but she is married to John (Thomas Mitchell). He is supposed to go hunting tomorrow in Canada, so the two lovers plan to meet in town. At Ethels home, they discuss the plan, but the inquisitive John is always near. He decides to clean his gun when he begins to talk to Paul. While Ethel watches in horror, Paul is shot. But he gives a performance pretending he was missed. Paul manages to get out to Luther, who takes him the St. Lukes Hospital.
Now that Paul doesnt need the tailcoat any more, Luther brings it to his friend Edgar (Rolland Young). He is the butler for Harry (Cesar Romero) who is marrying Diane (Ginger Rogers) that evening. While in her own apartment, Ellen (Gail Patrick), Dianes friend comes and tells her that when she was looking in her husbands tailcoat, she found a comb with red hair. She knows her own husband has been cheating on her. They both go off the Harrys together.
While waiting for him to get up, they find his tailcoat just lying on the back of a chair. Ellen coaxes Diane into looking through it. In the last pocket she looks in, she finds a love letter from Squirrel.  They read it out loud, and Harry hears them. He runs to the kitchen and calls his friend George (Henry Fonda) to come and get him out of the fix.  George comes and says that he accidentally left his own tailcoat at the apartment last night when he came for a party and he gives Harry Paul Ormans tailcoat saying its his.
There is also a big break for a musician (Charles Laughton) and another vignette in which Edward G. Robinson is transformed from a bum to a classy lawyer attending his college re-union. There is also a great segment with W.C. Fields. It was not included in the original release, but it is included in the new home video version. Finally, the coat falls on a poor sharecropper community with some stolen money in it. It provides the townspeople with a wonderful Christmas! The coat ends up as a scarecrow on the farm, a far way from the tailcoat of a wealthy actor!
This movie has something for everybody. My Dads favorite vignette was the Edward G. Robinson episode. He liked it because it was very deep, talky, and ironic. My mom disliked that version because of the very same reason. Her favorite was the episode with Charles Laughton because it was heartwarming and charming. My favorite was the Ginger Rogers/Henry Fonda version because it went so smoothly and all the actors were at their best! All in all, it was a fantastic film, and everyone, not just film buffs, should enjoy it!",994896000,40,3369,4.519672131147541

740716,4,6303957005,"This movie is comprised of a series of vignettes having little in common expect a black evening jacket.  There are several major stars playing in various stories.  Personally I found the story involving a character portrayed Charles Laughton to be my favorite.  Charles Laughton was very compelling, as I have often found him.  Similarly, Edward G. Robinson was his unusual great professional self.  I am a great fan of both Henry Fonda and Ginger Rogers and they also appear and are great.

On the other hand, it must be remembered that this movie was made before the modern civil rights movement gained traction.  There is a story that involves African Americans that while artistically compelling, is full of stereotypes that one may find offensive.  I find scenes such as this to provide fuel for contemplation.  Paul Robeson stars in this vignette.  Paul Robeson is an extremely well educated and talented African American actor who was consistently placed in stereotypical roles.  This movie is a prime example of this.

I am glad I had the opportunity to see this movie.  It is well worth seeing for any fan of Hollywood History.  Thank You...",1491782400,2,1150,4.921875

740801,5,6303957005,"BACKGROUND: First heard mention of ""Tales of Manhattan"" some weeks ago on a 1942 rebroadcast of The Jack Benny Show; it sounded quite interesting, so looked it up in Maltin's fine reviews. OPINION: The movie is a stunning curiosity consisting of five 15 minutes vignettes linked by the trope of a wandering tailcoat. Each vignette features a young star (or stars) of the period. It's a treat to see young Rita Hayworth, Henry Fonda Fonda, Charles Laughton, inter alia, take on their assigned role--you notice, for example, what a solid professional Edward G. Robinson was.

The vignettes themselves offer a variety--humor and pathos--of melodramas that sustains continual interest in the film.",1448582400,5,693,5.243243243243243

740803,5,6303957005,"This film is one of Hollywood's priceless gems. The stories range from bittersweet to outright funny. It is memorable at the very least and a true masterpiece otherwise. The remarks about W.C. Fields being left out of the DVD can be understood if you are a big fan of this wonderful comedian (which I am), but I would argue that his contribution was minimal and, sadly, pathetic. I would rather see one of his films when he is at his prime than this bit of silliness that dampens an otherwise exceptional movie.
Tales of Manhattan is a collection of some of Hollywood's greats at their best in a well written story perfectly filmed and perfectly paced. Too bad there are only five stars in this rating--it should get ten stars at least.",1438041600,,736,4.583333333333333

740806,4,6303957005,"VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!! What empty suit philistine made the stupid decision to cut out W. C. Fields? There originally was a sequence in TALES OF MANHATTAN with W.C. Fields, but the final 1942 cut was deemed too long, so the Fields episode ended up on the cutting room floor before the film was released. In its place the producers shot and substituted a short episode with J. Carroll Naish to bridge the gap between the Edward G. Robinson and Paul Robeson episodes. The party Naish is robbing is the charity event run by Fields. When this film was released on VHS, BOTH the restored Fields AND Naish sequences were BOTH included. The continuity of the tranitions was a bit illogical, but reinserting this lost W.C. Fields short alone  justifies the price of the video. In this average quality DVD-R transfer, the Fields sequence is totally gone! If Fox didn't want to recut it back into the film, why not include it as an extra on the disc? I don't see the rationale. Why not release the version as it is cut in the VHS? The disappearace of the Fields segment is A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!!",1425686400,3,1092,4.658031088082901

We are given this ""ride"" of emotions through short vignettes as we follow a set of mens evening dress (TAILS) and how it effects the life of each new owner as it falls magically into their possession . Each owner is transformed by this coat of many emotions .
The cast of players are a treat. It seems the actors are each perfect for their short appearance and conveys the range of.emotions which were intended for each ones transformation. Edward G. Robinson is especially brillant . Its a pleasure to watch him step out of his little cesar or wimpy little man he was so often cast.

Frankly it's hard to pick a favorite story because actors like Boyer, Hayworth, Fonda, Rogers, and Robinson are simply at their best in this movie.  You could teach an entire acting class on Robinson's brilliant and touching portrayal of a man down on his luck returning to a class reunion.  Makes me well-up every time I see it.  For me the only negative is that the wonderful series of stories finishes with what seems to be the only weak one of the bunch with Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson.  Other than that minor flaw, this is truly a marvelous old movie that many people don't know about and yet every fan of old movies should see/own.",1396483200,4,781,4.58273381294964

740994,3,6303957005,"Five vignettes featuring some of 20th Century Fox's stars of the early 1940s that are connected by a formal tailcoat.  The tailcoat first appears newly made for a pretentious actor played by Charles Boyer, who is told it is cursed.  However, rather than a curse, for each of the stories it plays a role in either saving them from a mistake or bringing them fortune.  In the opening story, Boyer, although shot, realizes that his adulterous relationship with Rita Hayworth is a mistake.  In the second scene, the coat helps Ginger Rogers realize on her wedding day that her true love is Henry Fonda and not her intended husband.  The coat moves on to Charles Laughton, the timid composer, who is first embarrassed as the coat tears in front of a huge audience and then is saved by the Maestro and goes on to great success.  The fourth vignette features Edward G. Robinson an alcoholic down and out who is given the coat to attend a dinner of his alma mater and an ultimate return to his fortune.  The coat finally ends up in a rather embarrassing scene with Paul Robeson as a sharecropper.  Full of ""negro"" stereotypes, it does give Robeson a chance to make a speech about communal farming and a brief opportunity to sing.
The film is very much a product of its time and for me the Rogers-Fonda and Robinson scenes have lasted best but still it is quite entertaining although sometimes rather sickly sentimental. The quality of the DVD is very good but you get the movie and nothing else - no special features and no chapters, just an ability to skip every 10 minutes.
This is the version that was put on general release.  There was a scene with W.C. Fields giving a lecture on the evils of drink that was cut before release.  On the VHS release of the film by Fox this scene was reinserted but not on this version.  One can see why they made the original choice to take out the Fields scene, it is irreverent and very funny and really has nothing of the feel-good nature of most of the rest of the film.  If you want to see that (and I'd recommend it more than the rest of the film) it is available in its entirety on Hidden Hollywood II (AMC).",1389484800,3,2144,4.427480916030534

Cleverly scripted, it is composed of series of tightly written vignettes centering of a suit of dress tails and the story of their connection to this particular piece of dresswear. Starring a cast which includes Edward G.Robinson, Charles Laughton, W.C. Fields, Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson, Ethel Waters, Charles Boyer, Rita Hayworth, Henry Fonda, Ginger Rogers, and many fine character actors of the era, the stories range from funny to poignant. The ensemble cast and clever scripting use the 'tails' as the glue that holds each segment together and bridges all the segments.
While this is clearly an example of ensemble acting be aware that this is more akin to an anthology as opposed to one of those blockbuster movies where an entire movie is populated by the producing studio's actors contractually obligated. to appear in their product.

Knowing that this piece of film history had been already transferred onto a video master makes this an even worse missed opportunity. For those who have never seen the dropped nine minute segment, Phil Silvers and Marcel Dalio portray the Santelli Brothers, who own a used clothing store where Fields buys the dinner jacket the film revolves around. Frequent Marx Brothers co-star Margaret Dumont's character is a wealthy woman who hires Fields to give a lecture on the evils of alcohol. Those who complain that Fields wasn't ""funny"" enough in the segment don't realize that he wasn't just a comedian, he was also an actor and all-around entertainer. It's sad that film buffs still have to rely on a VCR and VHS tapes to own and watch many classic films.  At least you can pick up many VHS films very cheap if you look around.

741202,4,6303957005,"*Bit of an ending SPOILER ahead*

I'm a sucker for the concept of the ""life as a circle"" in film, with some plot device used in most cases to carry the story from character to character through the whole film, possibly back to the person it started with and possibly not.  This is one of the earlier examples I know of; Max Ophls' 1950 French film LA RONDE is probably the best-known and loved classic example; a couple of other well-known renditions of the basic idea are THE YELLOW ROLLS ROYCE (1964) and SLACKER (1991).  It's always fun to see just how the filmmakers will maneuver the story to get back to the beginning, and just how readily they can make the characters' crossing of paths both interesting and at least faintly realistic. In this case, the ending is truly bizarre and unlikely, and almost kills a film which was a whole lot of fun up until that point.

There's a jacket, see, a handsome tailcoat that belongs to a famous Broadway start, and it's the jacket that migrates, from Charles Boyer the start to playboy Caesar Romero, on to would-be composer Charles Laughton and down-and-out lawyer Edward G. Robinson, while also touching friends, lovers and enemies like Elsa Lanchester, Rita Hayworth, Thomas Mitchell, Ginger Rogers, W.C. Fields, and Henry Fonda. All well and good with plenty of moments of intrigue, romance, and good old fashioned star-power, until the coat makes one last journey, out of an airplane and into the hands of a poor black man in some unnamed and somewhat unearthly southern town. Paul Robeson's voice and presence are certainly powerful enough, but they aren't alone enough to keep the last segment's religious mawkishness from leaving a bad taste in the mouth as songs are sung and massive amounts of money are miraculously found and put to good use by the poor townspeople. Well, it was the war, and I guess they needed an uplifting ending, and maybe at the time it seemed like nothing less than a miracle would do...

Still absolutely worth seeing, and one of the better all-star ""revue"" type films from the era.  Director Julien Duvivier really ought to be better known generally; this probably isn't one of his best films by any means, but he invests it with a great deal of wit and a very facile and light touch in the transitions that keeps the film from betraying the essential determinism of the plot for quite a while.",1264032000,,2377,4.701923076923077
741203,5,6303957005,"I first saw this movie years ago on AMC - I'd never heard of it but there wasn't anything else on, so I settled in to watch.  After all, with the cast of stars including Rita Hayworth, Ginger Rogers, Henry Fonda, Charles Laughton and Edward G. Robinson, I figured it couldn't be too bad.  I was wrong - it was GREAT!  The story involves a tailcoat which is passed from one story to the next and affects the lives of each person who receives it.  Some of the stories were pure 40's fluff and that's okay - I like fluff.  But two of the ""tales"" especially touched my heart - so much so that here I sit, years later, writing a review that I hope will inspire someone else to watch this hidden gem.  You'll see other people talk about the vignette with the great Edward G. and I agree - it's absolutely one of the best stories and the performance he gives is one for the ages.  However, my personal favorite is the piece with Charles Laughton - a truly gifted and underrated actor.  He plays a man of little means whose love of music leads him to a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to conduct a symphony orchestra performing his own composition.  I don't want to give away too much but suffice it to say that there is a single moment in this story that will cause tears to form in your eyes - much in the way that I cry everytime I watch Harry Carey as the Vice President looks at Jimmy Stewart's Mr. Smith (Goes To Washington) at the very end of the film when it looks as if all hope is lost (that little smile he gives gets me everytime!)  Tales of Manhatten is a wonderful film to watch again and again - it doesn't feel dated at all - because the glory of the human spirit is the same now as it has always been....enjoy!",1195603200,34,1718,4.210365853658536

741205,5,6303957005,"Other reviewers have given plenty of information regarding the general shape of this film--stars, cast, vignettes.  A wonderful collaboration of ten different writers who together with a cast of stars, character actors, the Hall Johnson Choir (one of the gems of the Harlem Renaissance), and probably every extra then available in Southern California trace the path of a tailcoat cursed by it's tailor.  This film was released in September 1942, the same month the German 6th Army began it's advance on Stalingrad; it was, and should be, considered light entertainment.  Not Frank Capra-ish, each vignette weaves into the next with the final feeling of the film leading the viewer to  believe that people, good and bad, somehow get what they deserve.  A gentle gem with a particularly wonderful performance by Edward G. Robinson.  Watch it with an open mind.",1141689600,5,858,5.136690647482014
741206,3,6303957005,"""Tales of Manhattan"" was an essentially pointless series of vignettes starring a plethora of stars under contract to 20th Century Fox studios.  The pretext for the story surrounded a finely tailored formal tailcoat which was purported to be cursed.  The tailcoat represented a talisman of both good and evil as it was passed from character to character.

The tailcoat was first presented to Charles Boyer who was portraying wealthy actor Paul Orman.  Boyer winds up getting shot by the husband of the ravishing Rita Hayworth, who was the object of his affections.  The coat gets handed down by Boyer's valet and is soon involved in a witless passion play starring Henry Fonda, Ginger Rogers and Cesar Romero.

On and on the plot goes, with the coat get handed down from one person to another.

Clearly the highlight of the movie was a recently resored story involving the teetotaling professor W.C Fields who was extolling the virtues of coconut milk in a lecture sponsored by Margaret Dumont of Marx Brothers fame.  Dumont's husband had secretly spiked the milk with gin creating a raucous scene with Field's at his vaudevillian best.

Edward G. Robinson starred in another good story involving the turn of fortune of a basically decent, down on his luck lawyer.  He uses the coat to dress up for a 25 year college reunion and gets his dignity and self respect restored among his upper crust classmates.

The film was fairly entertaining but in no way would ever be confused with any memorable movie classic.",1119657600,4,1509,4.87843137254902
741207,3,6303957005,"Like ""The Yellow Rolls Royce"", ""Tales of Manhattan"" is a movie about a single object owned by many different people over time, and how the object plays a role in the lives of those owners, in this case, a formal tailcoat. ""Tales of Manhattan"" is a virtual Syms clothing store of a movie, chock full of ""names you must know"": Ginger Rogers, Henry Fonda, Charles Boyer, Rita Hayworth, Charles Laughton, Edward G. Robinson, Cesar Romero, and WC Fields. I think it is about one tale too long--the WC Fields one--and that's why I bobbed this tail down to 3 stars instead of 4. His skit is way too long and frankly rather boring. Otherwise, there's a melodrama, a few get-out-your-hankie pieces, and a comedic romp. Really an omnibus, with something for everyone. Unless you're into WC Fields, fast forward when you get to that one, and you'll be okay.",1010102400,8,846,4.684563758389261
741208,5,6303957005,"I became aware of this masterpiece through reading about W.C. Fields and his involvement. Always fascinated by stories of ""lost"" or ""deleted"" footage from classic stars (i.e. many Laurel and Hardy segments, Elvis Presley's 1955 movie short, the Three Stooges alternate version of ""Malice in the Palice"" with a cameo by Curly three years after he retired, etc.), I purchased this tape immediately after discovering that Field's originally removed segment, described as a fairly long, verbal sequence coming at a time when his film career was decidedly in decline, was included in this release.
I was not at all disappointed in the ""temperance lecture"" scene beautifully executed by the master. (It's somewhat understandable that the bit was cut, as the movie was very long. Too bad that the material could not have been fashioned into a one or two-reeler at the time, as slightly outdated as they were by '42).
 Other memorable performances come from Edward G. Robinson (at a class reunion), and Ethel Waters, who is brilliant despite the stereotypical Southern scene.",1004918400,22,1067,5.167630057803469
