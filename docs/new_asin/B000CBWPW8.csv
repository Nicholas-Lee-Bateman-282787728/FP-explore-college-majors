8096718,1,B000CBWPW8,"I expected more of a kid's documentary on horses, in English with Spanish subtitles or in Spanish with English subtitles.  Instead a got a very simple CD with only a handful of vocabulary words, repeated in Spanish and English, using the same video footage.  Even primary schoolers would lose interest in the slowness and repetition.",1289174400,,333,5.036363636363636
8096719,2,B000CBWPW8,"I bought this to show to a group of 9 year olds in an after school camp class.  They found it quite boring and lost attention quickly.  It is very slow.  I would only encourage this for pre-K...unless the children you are showing have no horse knowledge or you are trying to teach spanish.  I love the authors books, but this DVD was a flop for my purposes.",1207008000,,357,4.205882352941177
8096720,5,B000CBWPW8,"I watched this DVD in three 30 minute sections.  The scenery is breathtaking and the horses are so healthy and happy.  The bonus with this DVD is that you can learn many horse-related phrases - even if you aren't a kid - which I have found is very handy when communicating with my Hispanic friends.  I learned some words and phrases that I had been saying incorrectly for some years so for that alone, I am grateful.  Good stuff.  How about another one!!!

Now that I have completely brushed up on my Spanish, I am passing this on to my horse crazy niece who lives in New Mexico.  I know she will find it helpful and fun at the same time.",1133481600,7,638,4.223140495867769
