8069049,4,B0009X587S,I enjoy music from the 1950's and '60's. After listening to this dvd I sent it to my adopted daughter who loves this type of music also. She loves it. I'm sure you will too.,1380672000,,173,3.9714285714285715
8069050,1,B0009X587S,"A two-hour concoction of public-domain material transferred from what appears to be 4 VHS tapes from 1988. Poor quality all around, ranging from blurry to blurrier to blurriest, with only one or two exceptions.

All of the ads are public domain. You can download clearer copies from the Web.",1265414400,3,291,4.938775510204081
8069051,5,B0009X587S,"The cover says, ""A fantastic collection of live performances, news, and adverts from 1950's America."" And so it is. The film clips include (in performance): Bill Haley and the Comets, Fats Domino, The Platters, Jerry Lee Lewis, Gene Vincent, the Everly Brothers, Bobby Darin and Charlie Gracie. Also has many still photos and old ads from the 50's. And they give us a whole 2 hours and 25 minutes of this fun. I loved it. The times are gone, but not forgotten.",1233100800,6,460,4.621951219512195
