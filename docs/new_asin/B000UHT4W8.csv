8213337,5,B000UHT4W8,"I gotta say, this was a pretty good video, especially for the price! If you are a wiz at ball handling and your fundamentals are set, you might be disappointed. But for developing young players who want to get really good or if your skills are limited, this is a must have. Because with this video, you are setting the foundation for bigger and better things. This video shows you basic warm-up drills and quickly moves to the crossover, in-out dribble moves, behind the back, and spin moves, just for starters. Then as you develop your skills, you have more advanced dribble moves, which are excellent. Like, an in-out move with a crossover with a between the legs move, and then behind the back. This video shows the moves at game speed and then it shows you the moves in slow motion. Again, this is a great video for elementary, middle school, as well as high school basketball players, male or female. And the price is great!! I can't wait to buy the other videos!!!",1261612800,,970,4.548571428571429
8213338,4,B000UHT4W8,"The video quality was not as good as I've seen comparing same price points. The sound of the hosts voice was very low and I listened to it on head phones.  He was very monotone as if reading from a card. He did play college ball though and was very good.  The information given was above average for someone who knows very little, if you've coached high school on up you probably know most everything here.  If you're wanting to learn to take your dribbling to the next level because all you do is goof around and you want to make a team, then this is for you.  That being said you will need to have a lot of determination, these drills he shows aren't easy.  But if you can  practice and get to where you can complete all he shows you can probably make any team.",1200873600,2,763,4.156462585034014
8213339,5,B000UHT4W8,"This guy really knows basketball!  After purchasing his Fundamentals of Scoring DVD, I came back to Amazon because I also wanted to purchase his other two DVDs. His DVD series are really helping me improve. Ball handling was one of my weakest skill areas, but now I feel 100% more comfortable and confident handling the ball.  I endorse this product all the way. I can get helpful b-ball instruction from Coach Godwin that I can watch over and over again!  The game of basketball will never change, and Coach Godwin will surely make you a timeless player!",1187481600,2,555,4.701030927835052
8213340,5,B000UHT4W8,"After reviewing AAB:The Fundamentals of Ball Handling, my game elevated to new heights. Not only am I the current North Carolina Dunk Champion, now I am able to better handle, penetrate, distribute and control the ball. This DVD is better than many other basketball instructional DVDs and camps with (so-called) professional ball handlers! AAB is the real deal. A ""must own"" for any and all real ballers!!!",1186358400,2,406,5.074626865671642
