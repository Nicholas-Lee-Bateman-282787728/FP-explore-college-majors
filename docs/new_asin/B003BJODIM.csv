4106501,4,B003BJODIM,"I have to admit the only reason I wanted to watch this movie is because my favorite country singer Wade Hayes has two songs in the movie, one during the movie (Good Day To Go Crazy) and then one playing while credits roll (Population Sign).

I really liked the movie but I could do without the foul language.  Sometimes I think that takes away from an actors performance.  Chris Pine and Shawn Christian were awesome in this movie.  I've been a fan of Shawn's for quite some time and this was the first time for me seeing Chris and WOW!

I think you will be pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I wasn't certain where they were heading with it, I thought it was a movie about a guy moving to Nashville but it's interesting how all the characters lifes are entwined in this movie.

Give the movie a view.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised and again it contains excellent music.",1276041600,14,1041,5.118343195266272
4106502,5,B003BJODIM,I'm disappointed this movie isn't coming out in the theaters but at least we'll get to see it.  I've seen almost all of Chris Pine's movies and I think he's immensely talented.  Can't wait for this dvd primarily to see him play guitar and sing.,1272672000,3,244,4.4
4106503,5,B003BJODIM,"I'm pre-ordering this for one reason:  Chris Pine stars in it (Captain Kirk from Abrams' Star Trek 2009 movie).  He sings and plays music, and it should be fun.

He was fantastic as Kirk -- even to a Star Trek fan since 1966, such as myself.  I've seen him play guitar in ""Blind Dating,"" a good movie which I would also recommend, especially to Pine fans -- but also in its own right.",1271203200,4,384,4.219178082191781

4106508,5,B003BJODIM,"I guess I joined the ""Piney's"" as I truly enjoy Chris Pine's movies.  Great little movie, with lots of sweet moments.  If you like Chris Pine, you'll love this lovely story.  And bonus - he sings great!!",1438905600,,203,4.4324324324324325
4106509,4,B003BJODIM,"I enjoyed this little film quite a lot and don't entirely get why critics weren't more in favor of it.  The always immensely appealing Chris Pine lifted this out of the ho-hum category without a doubt.  His range of emotion is always spot-on, and that twinkle in his eye makes him a joy to watch.  Turns out the man can sing as well!  That's a lot in one neat package.  Who knew Captain Kirk had so many tricks up his sleeve?  As for the rest of the cast, which includes Pine's father Robert in a supporting role, everybody brought their A-game to the table.  Believe me, there are lots of movies that do not deliver what this one does.  If you are looking for a diverting afternoon's pleasure, you have found your meat if you elect to give this one a try.",1436313600,3,756,4.274647887323944

4106512,1,B003BJODIM,The only reason to watch this movie is for the scenes with Chris Pine.  The story is depressing and weak and most of the characters are annoying.  I wish there was more than one song from Chris Pine singing because he's a good singer and a good actor.,1418083200,,251,4.208333333333333

4106516,4,B003BJODIM,"Enjoyable movie and great performances by Pine and Hawks.  Solid movie across the board, well written script and deft direction.",1394668800,,128,5.4
4106517,1,B003BJODIM,"To be honest I didn't finish watching this movie. I made it through about 75%. It was not what I had expected (a love story). It was a movie about a small town filled with unhappy people. Normally, I can find one thing good to say about a movie such as one good actor/actress. beautiful setting or wardrobe. Literally, there is nothing to recommend about this movie. The only thing I can say is, if you are having problems in your own life, maybe watching this movie will make you feel about your own.",1387670400,,501,4.340425531914893
4106518,1,B003BJODIM,"Watched this movie because Chris Pine was in it.  He did really well acting in this movie but the story was an absolute train wreck (no Unstoppable pun intended!).  The characters really don't get any sort of introduction and the story is really all over the place.  If you want to watch 90 minutes of Chris Pine doing a great job acting his way through a very confusing script then this is the movie for you.  If not, then this is one to avoid, unless you've got nothing better to watch.",1387065600,,488,4.329670329670329
4106519,4,B003BJODIM,"I did enjoy watching it.  At first I didn't like it but the story line became more interesting as it developed. There were several characters to keep track of and the author of this story did incredibly well at wrapping up all the loose ends. He also kept the story very strong all the way through. Another fun surprise in it was that not only did Chris Pine star in it but so did his father, Robert Pine. I recognized him immediately because I had watched his TV show, CHiPs, for years when I was a kid. It was also very funny at times.",1386374400,5,537,4.163461538461538
4106520,5,B003BJODIM,This is a good character study.  Chris Pine gave his usual believable performance.  Gave a portrait of a small town and the interaction between different types of people.,1386115200,2,170,5.035714285714286
4106521,4,B003BJODIM,"Some week spots in the plot & dialogue, esp. at the very last, but overall an enjoyable movie about ambition, very small towns, & serious/ life-changing decisions we all have to make.  & Chris Pine really can sing.",1381017600,,214,4.631578947368421
4106522,5,B003BJODIM,I loved the characterizations in this movie! Small town America at it's worst and best! I've known a lot of people just like that from the local trouble maker turned bank robber who gets caught right near the bank to the guy who gets out and does something big in life! A wonderful film!,1377388800,2,287,4.333333333333333
4106523,5,B003BJODIM,"I saw this movie on cable, & fell in love with it. Shawn Christian & Chris Pine were great. The story line great.",1376611200,,113,3.9565217391304346
4106524,5,B003BJODIM,"this movie has different levels of life. first the small town life and the friends and loves involved, next the ability to find more if that is what it really is. there are some that are very happy in a small town, and that is all right. but for some it is important to find oneself and what he or she is capable of. for them it is not a happy time in a small town. it is about what each person's  priorities are. in this case Rhett (Chris Pine) has an opportunity to be more than he is in that town. I agree that if you really feel that way you have to try, even if you fail. in a sense you never really fail, you just get the answer you will need later on in life. Rhett has to give up everything to pursue what he feels is his dream. the characters are not that far from real in the portrayal of how it would probably be . granted it is a movie, and certain privileges have to be taken, but overall it is a moving story of what each of us would have to go with in that decision. this is only my opinion, and i am far from always being right. i grew up in a small town, and it is different from the ""larger"" life. it is not for everybody, as there is more of a story and very little ""action"" involved. but it is interesting.",1374969600,9,1226,3.8844621513944224
4106525,3,B003BJODIM,"Love Chris Pine, which is what sparked me to watch this film. He gives a good performance, but the movie itself is a little confusing. A lot going on all at once and the characters are never introduced or explained well. Bit of a sad plot, kind of a downer, but if you're looking to see Pine show his acting talent in a very different role for him and watch him play guitar, this movie is for you! ;)
Thankfully this film is only 90 minutes, I don't think I could've sat through much more of it.... Just strange and confusing lol",1373068800,2,529,4.196078431372549

4106528,3,B003BJODIM,"I have just started to see Chris Pine in some movies. So I thought I'd check this one out.

This movie is kind of boring. No real story there. Just a small town guy looking to leave to follow this dreams. All the other characters are pretty messed up so you'd think he would leave right away but then I guess there wouldn't be a movie at all...",1358035200,,344,4.0588235294117645

4106531,1,B003BJODIM,What a disappointment!  Did not waste my time finishing it. Full of profanity and worthless story line. So many to choose from. DOn't bother with this one.,1351641600,2,155,4.7407407407407405

4106533,4,B003BJODIM,"The reasons I bought the DVD ""Small Town Saturday Night"" from Amazon.com are:
1. It features actor Chris Pine (James Kirk of Star Trek)
2. It has Chris Pine's debut as a singer
3. The basic storyline appealed
4. The DVD is not available in New Zealand.

I found this movie difficult to review as it has so many different features and characters. It contains so many sweet, endearing, humorous moments and others that show ignorance, stupidity, base crudeness. For me, its biggest failing is overuse of bad language - way too many 'f' and 'm-f' words spoken throughout. There is little real violence but there are scenes of bad behavior. It feels more violent because of the pervasive bad language, but this way of presenting a story and characters is a fairly realistic interpretation of how life can be for many.

This film is really about two people in particular, Rhett Ryan and Donnie Carson. Both grew up in the same small town of Prospect, know each other but their lives are a complete contrast. Neither were just only individuals of circumstance and background, however the negativity and anger possessed by one lead to unfortunate outcomes not shared by the other happier, more positive person.

What many of the characters have in common is a little girl, Megan (Rhett calls her ""Magpie"") due to their familial and/or emotional connection to her. Family dynamics of two different families and how they impact on the two main protagonists are one of the movie's main features .

The ensemble cast of actors play their roles well. Chris Pine as Rhett Ryan does not disappoint, nor does he as a singer either. He sings ""Someday Came Today"", a simple melodic country pop song, sung with finesse. He has a good voice. I would like to hear more from Chris Pine, the singer.

Another highlight is the lovely scenery shown at various times throughout the movie. So many miserable, cranky people living in the midst of such scenic beauty, amazes me. Perhaps that is not so unrealistic either. Negative, careless Donnie is shown casually throwing beer cans and cigarette butts into the town's lovely lake.

Overall, I like the film. It is not the greatest film ever but it is by no means the worst either. If your ears can get past the potty mouthing, the film and its characters may grow on you.",1277942400,2,2296,4.7275

8393689,2,B003BJODIM,"This movie was mostly about unhappy people in a small town and their varying degrees of depression.  There was almost no music, which is a shame, considering it's a movie about a singer/songwriter about to move to Nashville.  I like Chris Pine, but even he can't make this movie worth watching.  Not worth paying for it.  If you want to see it, wait for it to become available on Prime.",1489881600,,386,4.4714285714285715

8393692,1,B003BJODIM,"Small Town Saturday Night is the title of a hit by Hal Ketchum written by Hall of Fame songwriter,  Pat Alger, who also wrote several number onemail songs for and with Garth Brooks. These two guys have less than half the talent of the three men mentioned.  Stealing a song title for a movie which is hardly worth watching is a symptom of all that is wrong with music biz. The young up and comers have no respect for the industry and do not believe they should pay their dues. It is owed them and all they give us is music which sounds the same and is utterly souless. Mr Alger is the current HOF chair and has spent hours in Washington fighting for songwriters and artist to be paid as per contracts and protected under copyright laws ,their work. Never occurred to these bozos to ask permission for the use of the title or include the song in the movie because they want their same age fans to believe they are smart enough to have created it. That's fine because when they get old and go to songwriter purgatory,  Ole Johnny, Waylon,  and Kris will be there to school them on respect. They will NEVER  be remembered for their originality,talent, and their legacy will be no more than gum on my shoe picked up on Broadway in downtown Nashville.
