8083212,5,B000B86MZI,"I was really happy that this wasn't yet another 'Over Wherever' video post card full of tourist info telling you what you are seeing. Nor was it just wallpaper. It's actually a really entertaining story tracing the surprising ways that Irish culture's view of the the Island has changed over the centuries going back to the ancient Celts. Very poetic in a fun way, and very surprising. I saw that someone said the music was distracting from the pictures, but I don't understand that. The music helps tell the story and is really pretty great. And the visuals really are spectacular. I don't think I've seen another film like this one.",1267660800,4,634,4.7207207207207205
