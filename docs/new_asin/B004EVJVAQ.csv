8427646,5,B004EVJVAQ,"This book has nowhere near the amount of detail as many of the other ""documentary""style DVD's that I have in my Stones library, However,  this program is more than adequate to cover the main events in the lives of the Rolling Stones. I found new references and other new information  in this presentation. So, it's not deep or detailed but it covers the Rolling Stones pretty well. Well done by the History channel",1418083200,,414,4.657534246575342
