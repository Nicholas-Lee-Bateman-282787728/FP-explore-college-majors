8765348,5,B01HFRBJAA,"There is just something about this flick that I find makes for good entertainment.  The cast is terrific and in their pre-prime days.  The setting in small town USA, and centered around a Demolition Derby business where the main characters find their lives changing, presents great appeal to this middle America film fan!  Well written, well played, decently directed.  One of my favorites.",1518739200,,390,5.142857142857143
