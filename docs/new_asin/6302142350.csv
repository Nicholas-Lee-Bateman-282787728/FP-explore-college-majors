433139,1,6302142350,"I bought this for my nephews. We use to rent this movie on VHS when they were very young. (They are in their twenties now.) They loved it. We must have paid for it many times over for the number of times we rented it at the video store. Anyway, when I saw it was on DVD I thought it would make a nice memory for them to share with their own families now. WRONG! Someone had the bright idea to change all the music in the movie, so the DVD soundtrack is not the same as the VHS movie. Who releases a DVD of an old VHS movie and changes the entire soundtrack? The music isn't even newer - it's older stuff and not as funny. The music in the original movie really added some great moments to the movie. The story is still the same, but not as good with the new music. DON'T BUY this DVD if you are looking for the original VHS movie. YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED! I also don't recall seeing any note in the movie description about the new soundtrack. I feel misled. From now on you can bet I will be checking the reviews more carefully on any future purchase, even if I think I know what I'm buying!",1242950400,9,1092,4.0368663594470044
433140,2,6302142350,"I bought two of these DVD's.  One for myself and one for my sister.  When we were younger we used to rent this on VHS almost every week and watch it.  I'm not sure why we never bought it but we never did.

I was so excited to see that Little Marines was on DVD and available so I snatched up two of the as quick as I could.  If I knew what I had coming, I never would have ordered them.

The handling of the package was terrible.  Both DVD cases were literally crushed and in pieces.  First thought?  ""Oh well, at least the DVD's aren't damaged"".  I understand that Amazon and the seller have nothing to do with the handling after UPS gets it but it still upset me.  Maybe the DVD's could be packaged a little more secure instead of thrown into a small box.

Then when I popped the DVD in I was very disappointed.  There are several points in the movie where the music was actually changed!  I was pissed.  I loved the original music and that is one of the main reasons I bought it.  To put it in and find that the music had been dubbed over was very disappointing.

Oh well, what did I expect for $20.",1232668800,3,1102,4.051162790697674

433142,5,6302142350,"So one time Pico Salazar and I were driving cross-country on our quest to find the most delicious funnel cake when we came upon West Memphis, and I noted: ""Hey, look! This is that place where them devil-worshipers from that documentary Paradise Lost murdered those little kids."" I noticed that the little hairs on the back of my neck were starting to stand up, and Pico must've noticed that something was fishy, cause he asked me, ""Dude, what's wrong? Are you scared that those Metallica-listening punks are gonna get you too?"" I said ""No. I just realized that West Memphis isn't part of Memphis, Tennessee."" He tried to dispute my claim, but I told him that, in fact, we were in ARKANSAS!

Now I know what you're thinking: ""OMG! That's where they filmed LITTLE MARINES!"" And you are correct. After pulling over to the side of the road to calm our nerves from the excitement of being in the same state as the master thespians Stephen Baker, Noah Williams, and Steve Landers, Jr., we got into a debate that quickly escalated into a 2x4-wielding Pico knocking me for a loop shouting ""SNAKE RULES!"" I tried to inform him that, no, snake does not rule and that, indeed, young Stevie is the far-superior character. Alas, Once blood was drawn, there was no turning back. I managed to make a mad dash back to the El Camino to grab my paintball gun from under the seat just before I received another board-lashing across the face. Fortunately, I was able to get off three quick rounds in Pico's face. Good thing He already had that cleft palate, cause otherwise, he might've been in pretty bad shape.

Decideing that rock, paper, scissors was a much better way to settle a dispute, we sat down on the gravel road, bruised and bloodied and laughed. We then ate two of the thirty-two Snicker we packed and laughed about the good-ol' days when we were in that lip-synching trio using bananas as microphones.

I love you Pico Salazar, for you were the ONLY other person who enjoyed watching someone use shaving cream and electric clippers to shave a mowhawk on their head, thinks dirt bikes are cool, and mispronounces the word Studebaker. For this, you and LITTLE MARINES will always lie close to my heart.",1150156800,4,2195,4.652061855670103
433143,5,6302142350,"Let's start at the beginning shall we?  For the people who have seen this movie and are wondering why it has earned a five star rating with it's atrocious acting, a screenplay that lacks any real plot,  and the end result seeming like the entire film was thrown together on a shoestring budget and filmed with a couple of camcorders.  Yes...I agree, ordinarily this list of important downfalls would sink a movie instantly and have it's audience tuning out within the first fifteen minutes.  Ironically, it was because of the film's obvious imperfections that I remained watching...let me explain.  I was laughing at it!

The movie opens on the last day of school  in a small redneck town, where it seems the only haircut acceptable by law is a mullet.  One of the main characters receives a ""paddling"" from a teacher.  Another appears to be in such a deep depression that one would think he is hosting cancer, as it turns out he has simply received a summer school referral.  From the get-go this movie sets a snail's pace for the rest of the film to follow.  Corny?  Definitely!  Amusing?  Yes...that too.

The three main characters, Chris (the apparent leader of the three), Stevie, and Noah have planned a summer camping trip months in advance.  The last day of school has come and gone as expected and the three set out on a summer camping trip that resembles something of a G-rated ""Stand By Me"".  No foul language, no drugs  (even when offered), no sex, no violence.  Well...there is a single run-in with a paintball gun wielding, reform school student named ""Snake"" who temporarily terrorizes the three innocents before they manage to circumvent the pseudo violent troublemaker.  Not exactly ""Die Hard""-type action but for this film...I guess it will have to do.

The three boys set up camp, construct a teepee (against their Captain's original wishes) and take in all the joys that usually accompany a youthful, summer, camping expedition.  Only problem...where is the plot?  It's as if we are literally watching homemade movies of an anonymous family's summer vacation spent in the Arkansas woods.  The characters seem to be working from a script only in a very general way.  Even the dialogue seems spontaneous in parts...and no, not in a gifted actor kind of way.

Noah Williams, who plays Noah in the film, is too insecure in his role.  Dorky and uncertain, he would have this reviewer believe that he is not portraying a character from a script but actually mirroring his real-life attitude and mannerisms.  His weak attempts to incapably carry the heavy workload and responsibility of a  protagonist's role in a film are obvious to those watching.  The casting director (if there was one) must have fallen asleep the day of Noah Williams rehearsal.  Without a doubt...most feeble figure in this film.

Stephen Baker (who portrays Stevie) and Steve Landers Jr. (Chris) on the other hand are acceptable and fun to watch work together.  The characters they depict in this film are believable and entertaining.  Stephen Baker (who shaves his head into a mohawk and dances to Dion's version of ""The Wanderer"" early in the film) displays a fine acting talent.  He is confident, he doesn't overcompensate, and most importantly...he is believable in his role.  Which is the primary goal of any actor to achieve when filming a movie.  Bottom line: Stephen Baker delivers.

And so does his co-star, who shares the same first name...Steve Landers Junior.  Undoubtedly, it's his participation in the film that helps retain the vitality of the script and the comfortable flow of dialogue between characters.  His role as ""Captain"" is appropriate being that its his presence and ambitious attitude that keeps the movie constantly moving foreword.

Both these young actors should be credited for their hard work, noted for their talent, and praised for picking up Noah Williams slack.

All in all...The Little Marines is a movie that entertains but not in a way people would consider theatrical.  More like...watching neighborhood kids play.  The quality of the storyline is there, but the film's unfortunate cheesiness and lame humor is what keeps this movie from being taken seriously.  Fun?  Yes...but not what you would call ""movie magic"".  A.J. Hixon's hit or miss film takes us for a mediocre, ninety minute adventure that fails to leave much of an impression even after the film's predictable last scare.",1141084800,4,4411,4.954979536152797
433144,4,6302142350,"I saw Little Marines when I was about 12 or 13 years old, I just came upon  it in the video store and decided to give it a try. I ended up really  enjoying it, and I watched it many times over the next year or so. I  finally out grew it, but I still consider it to be an entertaining film  directed towards pre-teens. The basic plot is about 3 boys that go camping  and pretend to be marines. They get into some adventures and have end up  with an experience that they will always remember.
The film it's self is  not an accademy award winner, and it's not my favorite movie of my  childhood or anything. But it is a genuinely fun movie, and I reccomend it  to anyone. If you want a nice coming of age plot with good family value  then pick up a copy of Little Marines.
On a side note I'd like to warn  anyone to stay far away from the sequel, this film was a piece of garbage  that had little to nothing to do with the original. The only reason they  call it Little Marines 2 is because they threw in a few flashbacks that  consist of clips from the original film. Believe me, the sequel isn't worth  the film it was shot on.",968025600,9,1126,4.009009009009009

7821983,5,6302142350,"I watched this movie growing up as a kid with my 3 brothers, now I get to enjoy my kids watching it while bringing back funny memories of my brothers and I watching it.  Classic old school movie :)",1412899200,,197,4.051282051282051
7821984,5,6302142350,"I got this specifically to convert it to a digital format, only because the DVD that was released years ago duped over the original soundtrack (that made the funny parts even more comical) with some elevator type music. That's lame.

My little brother and I used to rent this movie all the time from a little video rental store inside a grocery store here in town. But one day the grocery store closed down during a week that we had the video, so we were never able to return it. We watched it a ton as kids and my brother took it with him when he moved to Texas with his wife & kids... so rather than have him try to find it, I ordered this copy and made two DVD copies of the original movie for my brother and I to have (since I don't own a VHS)

Even though it's a low-budget film and is pretty cheesy, it reminds me of being a kid and how we used to watch it all the time growing up. I now have a baby boy due next month and I hope that he'll one day appreciate this silly little movie as much as we did :-)",1404950400,2,1011,3.926829268292683

7821990,3,6302142350,"Review for Little Marines Collection 2 Disc set

I too grew up renting this movie over and over on VHS. They totally butchered this film with dubbed over music killing the original soundtrack! I read the reviews and decided to buy it anyway to see how it was changed. still same story, same good movie if you can live without the original music and (why the hell I don't know) the talent show with the dead friend Matt that was cut into a lil 30 second piece they made go well with this DVD version but vhs version was cooler with the bannanarama song! funny thing it mentions all the songs (original soundtrack) from the vhs version in the credits.

I don't remember the music for Little Marines 2  but it seems they kept it the same.

This DVD Set is OK but I recommend the VHS version with the original soundtrack for the first Little Marines",1267228800,,845,4.3630573248407645
