8094753,5,B000BZ71E2,"I bought on amazon many years ago and still have the tape and box untouched from how I received it. thought about replacing this movie on dvd but i never will. this is uncut, the one that runs 30min longer then the original version on dvd. I like this movie a lot some parts can be scary. but in all i liked the main girl and thought she did an amazing job playing her charactor.
great movie right here <-----",1463270400,,409,4.125
