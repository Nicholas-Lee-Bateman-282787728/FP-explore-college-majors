8211822,4,B000U0G3GU,"It doesn't matter that the star (or the main name here) is Eulalio Gonzlez ""Piporro"". After his we see many other important names in mexican cinema, but for me, ""Ferrusquilla"" stole the show. Watch it and tell me if I am wrong. Sadly, Ferrusquilla appears briefly now and then, but it is still worth it...

Due to a series of misunderstandings, Piporro is mistaken for EL TRAGABALAS. That ensues for more than an hour of comedic situations. Little time into the movie we get to see the real TRAGABALAS, Eric del Castillo.

The cast is incredible! Ramn Valds is one of the soldiers, Mr Guillermo Alvarez Bianchi, Lorena Velzquez, Julio Aldama in a horse carriage with Evangelina Elizondo, later Flor Silvestre walking on the street is annoyed by a couple of bad guys, Carlos Len plays poker with Ferrusquilla, Dagoberto Rodrguez in a wheelchair pretending because later on he shows he can walk, David Reynoso, Emma Roldn, Andrs Soler, and many more. The cast alone is worth the movie, but Ferrusquilla rules!",1316908800,,1007,4.848837209302325
