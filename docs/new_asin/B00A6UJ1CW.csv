5386603,5,B00A6UJ1CW,"This is a great Korean historical drama that may help any any young people who may not be familiar with Korean history.  I have been checking to purchase these DVD's for sometime now and at approx $100 for all sets is a great bargain!  The quality is very good and language translation is pretty good too.  When this drama first came out, I was the interpreter to translate the Korean language to English to my husband.  But, now he can watch this anytime by himself!",1266883200,,467,4.458823529411765
5386604,2,B00A6UJ1CW,"This is an excellent series, but if you are an English speaker, you have to steer clear of this version. The English subtitles are utter nonsense. When words are not misspelled and misused, they are simply made up. Every line is like solving a puzzle. You must assign meaning to phrases like, ""I'm not shyless."" This series has some complicated political intrigue, and it's important to understand what's going on. I'm sure it's fine if you understand old-Korean, but if you rely on English subtitles, there are much better versions.",1264896000,17,533,4.933333333333334
5386605,5,B00A6UJ1CW,"The Jumong complete box set was an excellent price for a fascinating series.  The only drawback to this set is that the subtitles are rough, often literal translations, so the viewer has to be creative in his/her interpretations.",1264809600,6,229,5.026315789473684
5386666,3,B00A6UJ1CW,Hey guys my last purchase was an excellent order and you tried your best but the DISC 5 of the DVD didn't play at all. I tried on my pc and the DVD player but it was the same.,1436054400,,175,3.5128205128205128
5386667,5,B00A6UJ1CW,"I loved everything about Jumong.  I loved, loved his character, his clothing, his skills, his leadership, and most of all when Jumong became King.  I loved, loved his clothing.  I wished it was in a real life, not movie.  I also wished that in reality, Jumong got married with Seo-so Noe.  It is so sad that they went seperated ways.  They are so perfect for each other.  I would love to buy the Poster.  Anyone know how I can get it?",1432771200,2,434,4.271604938271605
5386668,2,B00A6UJ1CW,"Jumong is a great historical drama but there are some words of caution if you want to watch this with your kids.  There are scenes that are sensual as well as ritual sacrifices of animals, some inappropriate and immoral relationships, there are shrine priests women as well as divination, witchcraft etc., Although at times fanciful in story plot with a couple of guys taking on hundreds of soldiers, the story at times is slow.  I eventually threw out the drama.  I found that the korean drama Jewel in the palace was far better when it came to being family friendly as well as not as focused on those others things.  I felt these issues detracted from the greatness that this drama had to offer.  The characters are well developed,.but the drama is really long.  The subtitles as usual are sub par.  .",1431302400,2,803,4.612676056338028
5386669,5,B00A6UJ1CW,"Enjoyed. I also liked the mention of Episodes.
I wish all the Videos mention the number of Episodes.",1430956800,,100,4.611111111111111
5386670,3,B00A6UJ1CW,Good drama but too many skips and freezes.  I  would not recommend anyone to purchase this unless the seller can guarantee DVD without problems.  Do not waste your money!!!!!!,1405468800,9,175,4.9655172413793105
5386671,5,B00A6UJ1CW,"The show is worth the money. If you love some good historical fiction with a lot of action scenes and the journey of a young man from an unconfident youth to the rular of a kingdom, you will love this. There is also some romance.",1397260800,,229,4.111111111111111
5386672,5,B00A6UJ1CW,"Even though we have seen this before, once we got the video set, we couldn't wait to see it again. It is hard to stop (after all, you cannot watch all 81 episodes in one sitting!) because each episode ends so excitingly! What a beautiful production this was and it makes you desire for more just like it!",1396569600,,304,4.258620689655173
5386673,5,B00A6UJ1CW,"Enjoy every episode.  The sub titles were passable, but not totally accurate.  But good enough.  I love Korean Dramas.  They are a blast.",1396396800,,137,4.826086956521739
5386674,3,B00A6UJ1CW,the subtitles are really bad even though the story is good so far but to be honst I have seen worse,1382313600,,99,3.761904761904762
5386675,5,B00A6UJ1CW,"I have the last three volumns of this series but, could not afford to get the first volumn as it costs about the same as what I paid for all three volumns.  Next best thing was to get the whole seiries together even though the translation is not as good and there are cuz words in it.  Thanks anyway, I still love it.  Let me know when the first volume of this series ever goes down in price.",1377993600,,392,4.0
5386705,5,B00A6UJ1CW,"Gave it a five star only because I loved the series and actors ,but  quality of film left a lot to be desired seen first two on Netflix, ,so bought and then watched it all from box set I purchased and was disappointed",1374537600,8,217,4.046511627906977
5386706,5,B00A6UJ1CW,"Great series, could not stop for bed until the episode was over. I feel a loss now that it is finished.",1374364800,5,103,3.9523809523809526
5386707,5,B00A6UJ1CW,"This is a beautiful, if long film. I saw it before but missed the ending. Beautiful photography, costumes and sets.",1368057600,,115,4.8
5386708,5,B00A6UJ1CW,"I recently finished watching all 81 episodes of Jumong.  Without question, one of the best productions I've ever seen, far superior to anything out of Hollywood.  Granted the sub-titles can be awful with the cheeper sets (unless you happen to be fluent in Korean).  I would recommend you choose the seller ""Kona & More"" on Amazon if you have the chance.  I initally ordered a cheeper set and found the ""english subtiles"" to be anything but English.  When I gave ""Kona & More"" a neutral rating they were all over it.  They were determaned to make me satisfied.  They did.  They immediately shipped me a more expensive version with great English subtitles.  Once the subtitle issue was settled, I'm sorry I've finished the 81st episode.  It's the kind of sadness when you've finished a really great book, or movie.",1347926400,3,812,4.776978417266187
5386709,1,B00A6UJ1CW,"I believe we have been ripped off by a company that does not care.  This is my last purchase from Amazon.com as a result.  Not only was the English translation poorly done, but the quality was less than expected; the number of profanities was higher in number than the regular series; and some of the important scenes were altered, leaving out important information.",1319673600,3,366,4.7936507936507935
5386710,4,B00A6UJ1CW,"Well story line is awesome but when they start switching from season to season they hire a whole new tranlator staff, so if i were to read subtitles the name of the charachters change ever so slightly that you forget who is who leaving you wonder which charachter are they talking about. but after a while you catch on what happened. Still a great story and Legend.",1316995200,2,365,4.462686567164179
5386711,1,B00A6UJ1CW,"The English subtitles in this version are REALLY, REALLY bad.  The Chinese subtitles might be OK, I don't know.  Unless you speak Korean or read Chinese, DON'T buy this version.  For English subtiltes, you need the higher-priced 4 box set from MBC.  And did I say the English subtitles are REALLY bad?",1310860800,4,301,4.730769230769231
5386712,3,B00A6UJ1CW,"I love this series. I would love to buy it, but only if it came with subtitles in more languages. For English subtitles, I can watch it anytime I want for free on dramafever.com

Please make a multilingual version available.",1307836800,2,224,4.6
5386713,5,B00A6UJ1CW,"you should get one if you like Korean drama. this movie has other name called Prince of Legend, my friend bought 50 dollar cheaper at other big online website",1306886400,,158,4.482758620689655
5386714,5,B00A6UJ1CW,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my Aunt. We were impressed with the beautiful hard cover to begin with. There are double DVDs in each pocket...very nicely packaged.  I had the opportunity to watch a couple of episodes with them and it was nice to have the sub-titles in English.  Quality product and best price anywhere!!!!,1294790400,,329,4.655172413793103

8547190,5,B00A6UJ1CW,"Jumong is the sweeping story of tribal and regional conflict in ancient Korea. It has court intrigues, multiple love stories, frequent political plots, noble heroes and interesting villains, plenty of do-or-die battles, and hanging over all the threat of the Han Chinese and their technologically advanced steel weaponry. It's immersive and addictive, the TV equivalent of that novel you keep reading because you can't wait to see what happens next. I rented few discs out of curiosity and finished just one before I had to buy it and see the whole glorious thing. Viewers who don't like Downton Abbey or other similar miniseries will not like this. Those who love to binge-watch a ""good-read"" will like it a lot.",1510099200,,713,5.0
8547191,5,B00A6UJ1CW,Gift from my mom for my dad who always watched the show without English subtitles. He loves it.,1485302400,,95,4.333333333333333

8547194,1,B00A6UJ1CW,"The stories in themselves are great. I was very disappointed in the quality of the video within the DVD's. Not at all clear. Just started the first DVD and there is a water mark splash that came across as I was watching. Its as if someone downloaded the show from Youtube, burned them to a DVD and sold them on Amazon. Extremely disappointed. I may search Youtube for better quality.",1472947200,4,383,4.485714285714286

8547197,4,B00A6UJ1CW,"Fun drama about Jumong who is a Korean hero that united the ancient tribes against China.  There's lot of violence portrayed in a subdued manor.  There is some affection, but really no sex.  Once you start watching this, it's hard to stop.",1449619200,2,239,4.642857142857143
