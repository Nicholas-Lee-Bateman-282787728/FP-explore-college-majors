4903293,5,B005XLFBEG,"Season six (6) of BBC's ""Waking the Dead"" is, per usual, so very good keeping me well entertained with its very well written, directed  and sometimes very scary episodes also  with its extremely good acting.

In spite of many cast changes (i.e., third new pathologist, this season), season six (6) shows ""short-fused"" Chief Inspector  Boyd (brilliantly acted by Trevor Eve) and his Cold case investigative team solving some really  nasty ""cold cases"" that many times have ""tie-ins"" with current nasty crimes.  Much to my joy two (2) of the series' ""old"" characters and two of my favorites are still around helping Boyd solve these very horrendous ""cold case"" mysteries.  The two returning  characters that I adore  are the psychologist Grace wonderfully played by Sue Johnston  who is always able to keep Boyd ""grounded"" and  functioning at his brilliant best along with super sexy and tough Spence greatly acted by Wil Johnson--he certainly gets the other characters, this season, out of some ""tough spots"".  Again this season, the members of the ""Waking the Dead"" cold case team are very sure of their individual expertise in their profession and are not afraid to go ""toe to toe"" with their leader (Boyd) in expressing their opinions on how to solve a case.  I have always loved the ""knock down"" arguments that they all can have.  That ""feature"" of this series is very evident  in Season six (6).  By the way, the ""new"" pathologist is acted greatly--I like her.

All in all,  I loved Season six (6) on three (3) discs  with six (6) episodes that are in two (2) parts. All of the episodes in Season six (6) are really entertaining featuring tales about severe child abuse,  ""devil worship"" honor killings, locked in embrace skeletons falling out of ceilings from a room in a hotel not known to exist, extreme religious piety involving self-flagellation, Nazi monsters, love interest for Boyd, selling of drugs and ""money laundering"",  hidden gold etc.--all well written, acted and directed.  This season of ""Waking the Dead"" is some splendid entertainment with each episode having me poised on the ""edge of my seat"".

(By the way, one of my very favorite actresses, Eileen Atkins, is simply fabulous as a raving Nazi)",1327622400,6,2219,4.921832884097035

4903303,5,B005XLFBEG,"I really enjoy Waking The Dead and Season 6 does not disappoint.  Trevor Eve is just as great as ever, and so is the rest of the cast.  The thing I appreciate the most about this program is that it does not ""dumb down"" the plot as is done in so many American crime dramas.  The writers assume that they have an intelligent audience, and they relate to that by rising to a higher level of complexity and depth in their scripts.  I highly recommend this series.  Once you start watching, you won't want to stop!",1367280000,,509,4.260416666666667
4903304,4,B005XLFBEG,I watched this on Netflix until the end.  But I knew there were more so didn't want to wait until they were available.  Too good a series to wait.  this came very quickly and in great condition.,1364688000,,194,4.1891891891891895
4903305,5,B005XLFBEG,"Have loved this series from the beginning. Why is it BBC makes such great mystery/drama series? Unfortunately, when US buys rights to make they're own version we only manage to screw it up. They should just by the rights for the original and show them on BBC America like they used to.",1364256000,,285,4.5
4903306,5,B005XLFBEG,"This is a BBC series with excellent acting! Trevor Eve is the star and does an excellent job. It is a bit like Law and Order Criminal Intent. Don't be afraid of the British DVD's as they will play on your laptop hooked  up to your TV with the HDMI cable. Watch the whole series, worth the watch!",1360454400,,295,4.086206896551724
4903307,5,B005XLFBEG,My husband and I really liked this.  Stories kept your interest.  And very entertaining.  I do sometimes have trouble understanding what is being said due to the accent but does not lower the rating.,1360195200,,199,4.794117647058823
4903308,5,B005XLFBEG,"We purchased another DVD (all region) so we could continue with this series.  Great stories, not formulas and outstanding character actors make the show a real winner.",1352764800,,167,5.185185185185185
4903309,4,B005XLFBEG,"I have enjoyed the first six seasons of Waking the Dead, which chronicles the cases of a specialized unit of London coppers. The unit chief is played by Trevor Eve (Heat of the Sun) who resembles Victor Garber (Alias). Eve is a good actor, but he (or his director) have been developing a taste for scenery chewing over the seasons. Although Waking the Dead is certainly one of the best Brit procedurals, it has been sliding downhill a little. The whodunnit part of the show remains strong, but the interpersonal tensions of the squad have slipped into melodrama, making my review of Season Six a little less glowing than earlier seasons.

This is still a good show, but alternatives present themselves, like Case Histories, Whitechapel, Sherlock, Single-Handed, and, with a fond bow to Morse, Inspector Lewis.",1346284800,6,809,4.948529411764706

4903311,5,B005XLFBEG,"I like all of the ""Walking Dead"" cds.  They work well together.  The main character is a little too bossy but the rest of them know how to handle the situation.  Tbe acting very good.",1335830400,,183,4.171428571428572
4903312,5,B005XLFBEG,"Waking the Dead is one of my favorites!!!!!  For a while the complete series could not be purchased in the US. I had to order the series from
Amazon UK along with a multi-regional DVD player. If you enjoy watching Cold Case, then you will love this series!!!!  The characters are well
developed and the story lines are very interesting.  This is one of the few shows I can watch over and over again.  If your a fan of murders mysteries
this is a must see.  I find Cold Case(American Version) a bit too sappy but good.  However, Waking the Dead is a tense, gritty series that kept me on
the edge of my seat.",1335225600,,606,4.226086956521739
4903313,5,B005XLFBEG,"This show which lasted nine seasons was the english cold case series , only it was much darker than our now as well cancelled series. I disagree that this only about the characters argueing.  This show is the same as it always was. the lead character is a driven man who has lost everything but his job. He yells when things don't go well sure but the staff is dedicated to him. He is the father figure to the them and only in this season does Grace the mother figure of the group finally confront him about his  disfunctional behaviour. WHy do they put up with him because they are a team and they know he cares. He's not a bully.  The cases run from showing about how lsd destroyed people in the 1960's and it did do that , to nazi cases and much more. Each case is two episodes long and the show shouldn't have been cancelled. It wasn't done because of ratings that's for sure as this one was quite popular.  WE have three more dvd sets coming , and lets hope they don't continue to only release one set a year.  That would be a huge mistake as it would be 2015 before we get the final set. The acting in this one is outstanding and this series had the two newcomers from last series getting more at ease with their jobs.  There is little in the way of extras on this set. But if you like dark crime dramas played out over two episodes and that's 12 eps for this set then you will enjoy this one. And this isn't a csi show , it's more grim but engaging. And finally even the lead character has to face some of his disfunction in this one.",1331596800,13,1541,4.12

8488711,2,B005XLFBEG,"The quality of the stories seems to keep slipping! Wanted to like this series it has many top notch actors, but there is too much filler material to include constant flashbacks of the same scenes over & over & over again!!!! I found myself getting extremely bored with all of the stories on this disc. Personally, I would not recommend this season!!! The first three seasons were the best and then the quality tends to go downhill from there!!!",1439424000,,444,4.632911392405063
