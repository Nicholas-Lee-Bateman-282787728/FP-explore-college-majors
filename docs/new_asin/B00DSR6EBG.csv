[Read article here: [...]

***Pre-natal Yoga is something that I recommend to every single pregnant patient I encounter.*** I always have my patients check with their Obstetrician first, though, especially if there is a high risk pregnancy. Otherwise, I believe very strongly that prenatal yoga is the most important thing you can do for your body while pregnant, next to eating a healthy diet and taking fish oil and enough calcium.

Prenatal yoga is so important on so many different levels. I have pregnant women come to me all the time complaining of pains deep in the hips and lower back. Prenatal yoga, especially if started early in the pregnancy, is the key to feeling wonderful throughout and after your pregnancy.

Let's review the many many benefits of doing Yoga while you are pregnant.

Remember, always check with your doctor before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have a high risk pregnancy.

As you review the many benefits I have listed below, keep in mind that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Home-with-Hilaria-Baldwin-Fit-Mommy-to-be-Prenatal-Yoga/dp/B00DSR6EBG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">@ Home with Hilaria Baldwin: Fit Mommy-to-be Prenatal Yoga</a>is wonderfully consistent with all of these benefits.

1. Less Pain! Yoga can help relieve neck pain, upper back pain, lower back pain, hip pain, and pelvic pain. This is why I tell my pregnant patients that Yoga is mandatory!

2. By opening up the hips, sacrum, and pelvis, the ligaments are more easily stretched to accommodate the baby's head in a vaginal childbirth. This means an easier labor for mommy!

3. With all of the stretching involved, the muscles of the lower back, hips, and pelvis, become more relaxed and resilient, decreasing inflammation caused by the stress of holding the excess weight of the baby. With less inflammation, there will be less pain during labor.

4. With increased ""range of motion"" of the lower back (lumbar spine), hips, sacrum and pelvis, you will feel less stiffness throughout the day. The more you move, the more you will be able to move!

5. During yoga, there is a lot of spinal work which opens up the hormonal centers in the body. This counteracts hormonal imbalance which leads to constipation, moodiness, restless legs, insomnia, hot flashes, and excess weight gain. The lower back section of this video targets the hormones of the lower body, balancing estrogen and progesterone (mood, weight gain, constipation) and cortisol (stress hormones).

6. Yoga increases your sense of well being by releasing endorphins, increasing flexibility, filling you with energy and vitality, helping relaxation and sleep, and toning and strengthening your body.

7. Yoga is my favorite way to improve posture. In pregnancy especially, it is easy to allow the weight of the belly to cause excessive lordosis of the lumbar spine and kyphosis of the thoracic spine. It happens as you lean back slightly and the baby pulls your lower back forward, pressuring your lower and upper spine into a contorted, stressful and painful position. Yoga is the natural way to strengthen and lengthen the spine, without feeling like you are forcing yourself into an uncomfortable position.

The bottom line is that when you do Yoga, you feel good!

Remember, it's never too late to start your Yoga program, even if you are nearing the end of your pregnancy. At the same time, the earlier you start, the easier it will be!

Today I went ahead and did yoga with Hilaria in my living room, watching the DVD. Here are my observations:

1. It is a beautiful production. I love the setting, with the relaxing environment. Very professional.

2. Hilaria encourages nose breathing, which is vital to yoga practice. Excellent.

3. There are 2 other ladies in the video that practice at different levels. With three different levels for each yoga pose, it is much less intimidating to find the one that fits your level of practice.

4. Her use of yoga bricks and cushion was great.

5. Great stretching of hamstrings, calves, adductors, thighs, and lower spine.

6. Great strengthening of hips, legs, and buttocks.

7. Excellent stretching and strengthening of the abdominals and core.

There are 3 main sections to the video:

1. In the first section, she does an excellent job with posture, strengthening, and toning. Excellent lower back stretches and strengthening.

2. In the second section, the hip opening stretches are excellent. They will definitely help to relieve the pressure and pain from your hips and pelvis, and prepare for labor. Again, it's really good that she has the different ladies at different levels because a few of the stretches are somewhat challenging. But she makes for great accommodation with modified poses, pillows and blocks.

3. The last section, ""Express De-Stress,"" is my favorite. It is only 13 minutes, and hits a little bit of low back and hips, just enough to loosen up and relax the body. It's a great ""anytime"" yoga to throw on, get a short but sweet stretch, and relax.

**The bonus partner stretches with her husband, Alec Baldwin, are very good. I love the downward dog help, especially. And Mr. Baldwin's facial expressions are priceless!

In the video, Hilaria is herself quite pregnant, and she does the poses with ease and grace. She is very careful to protect her baby, and reminds us often to do the same. There is no forced movements! Gracefully done.

I have been doing yoga for many years, and the great thing about this video was that I was able to do the beginner level of some of the poses I hadn't practiced in the past, while practicing a deeper stretch on the more familiar poses. By having the 3 ladies at 3 different levels, one can start easier if you are a beginner, and then slowly and gently make progress with time. In this manner, the DVD is plenty enough to last multiple pregnancies.

When doing yoga while pregnant, don't force anything. Go super slow, be super gentle with your body and your baby. It is meant to be an enjoyable experience, so early injuries will kill the motivation for continuing. Take care with your body, especially if you are starting later in your pregnancy. Those lower back, hip, sacrum and pelvis muscles and joints are going to be very tight and painful, so the stretching and moving process must be done very slowly and gently.

Again, always consult with your obstetrician before beginning any exercise program while pregnant, especially if you have a high risk pregnancy.

Thank you so much for reading!

Blessings and Peace to you in your pregnancy and family life!

5853779,5,B00DSR6EBG,"Hilaria appeared on ""Live with Kelly and Michael"" to show off her moves from the DVD. They are easy to follow but really stretch your body.

5853780,5,B00DSR6EBG,"I often get bored with home workouts but this one keeps me engaged. Second trimester and while I am an active person (runner, dancer and inconsistent yoga enthusiast), I have not been as active in this pregnancy as my last. This prenatal yoga strikes the right balance and would work well for pregnant woman of various fitness levels and yoga experience. She also has a sweet way about her.",1486857600,,390,4.666666666666667
5853781,5,B00DSR6EBG,A great prenatal yoga workout! My go-to when I need a good workout and to really focus on my breathing. I like using this one along with Crunch Yoga Momma (easier and slower paced) along with Prenatal yoga with Desi (tons of good stretching and a little more of a workout than Crunch Yoga). I switch up the three based on what I need that day.,1485129600,2,343,4.212121212121212

5853785,5,B00DSR6EBG,This is a nice yoga practice for any level of yoga/flexibility. She goes over ways to modify as your baby belly expands. The length of the video is good also. It does move fast but after you do the routine a few times you'll remember what moves come next.,1480464000,,255,4.224489795918367

5853787,4,B00DSR6EBG,I loved the different segments. I wish it was a little slower for each pose. Other than that it's a great workout and I felt relaxed (or as relaxed as you can 8 months pregnant),1472256000,,177,4.085714285714285
5853788,5,B00DSR6EBG,just what the wife was looking for,1471564800,,34,4.0
5853789,5,B00DSR6EBG,I've enjoyed this yoga workout. I like that it's broken up into smaller segments of about 20 min each so depending on how much time or energy you have you can get it done. You do need two yoga blocks and a couple pillows. Her voice and music is pleasant and non intrusive.,1469318400,,272,4.150943396226415
5853790,2,B00DSR6EBG,I'm not a beginner and I found her instructions difficult to follow and the flow/temp of the routines were awkward.  Two stars because I get to stretch and any yoga is better than none.,1468540800,,185,4.4411764705882355
5853791,5,B00DSR6EBG,Really liked the pace and activity in these videos.  They kept me moving during my pregnancy.,1467158400,,93,4.8125

5853793,5,B00DSR6EBG,"When I first did this DVD in my 1st trimester I thought it was a joke.  It was SO easy.  Broken up in 3 segments (back relief, hip open and relaxation), I was used to a more strenuous yoga work out.
Now in my 3rd trimester, this is my favorite DVD.  I do this about 3xs a week.  I wake up with lower back pain and the back relief portion does WONDERS for me.  Hilaria is easy to follow and I feel like anyone can do it, flexible or not.  When I want a bit more, I'll do Shiva Rae's prenatal DVD.",1465776000,,495,3.803921568627451
5853794,5,B00DSR6EBG,"I really needed a video to be able to practice at home since prenatal yoga classes in my area are only offered once per week.  I must have checked out a dozen prenatal videos from the library and this was the only one worth purchasing.  I wish there were a few more modified chaturangas, but that is easy enough to add on my own.

Hilaria does an excellent job cueing and providing modifications.  There is no obnoxious banter like so many prenatal videos.  She uses blocks much more than any instructor I have had, in classes or videos, and I picked up on some tricks I will probably use post-pregnancy as well since I am not very flexible (by yogi standards).  Difficulty is somewhere between easy and intermediate, but I am only in my second trimester so that assessment may change.

This is a solid yoga video with pregnancy modifications.  Yes- she does presume, as a lot of reviewers have mentioned, that you know some yoga terminology but there are numerous youtube videos and online guides if you need an introduction.  If you already practice regularly and want to be able to continue during pregnancy, this is a good choice.",1461628800,,1134,4.63
5853795,2,B00DSR6EBG,This video shows too much cleavage.,1459123200,,35,5.0
5853796,4,B00DSR6EBG,"This is a nice and relaxing workout for moms to be. I feel stretched out and destressed after doing it. There are three different workouts and each one is well put together by the instructor. There are modifications for first, second and third trimester so you can use it throughout pregnancy. Only reason I didn't give it five stars is the instructor does her breathing cues pretty fast and at times I have to stop and recover my breath. She doesn't give you enough time to inhale and exhale like you should be in a yoga practice. Maybe if I wasn't pregnant I wouldn't be aware of how fast she goes with the breathing, but it's not what I'm used to in yoga. But I do recommend it as a great strengthening and stretching workout.",1457222400,2,729,4.407407407407407
5853797,5,B00DSR6EBG,"I've been practicing yoga for over 10 years and once I got pregnant I felt very dejected that my movement was so limited. I also suffered from debilitating lower back pain from first trimester on. I'm usually suspect of celebrity yoga instructors, but this DVD has been a real lifesaver. It gave me confidence that I could still have a fit yoga body while pregnant, and also relieved my back pain significantly. I use this DVD almost every day now that I'm in my third trimester and the aches are getting more taxing. I highly recommend this DVD!",1453766400,,546,4.581632653061225
5853798,4,B00DSR6EBG,"This is the only prenatal yoga DVD I can abide while pregnant. It is a little fast paced, and Hilaria makes silly faces every once and a while (very smiley, that woman...) I am not considered a beginner when it comes to yoga, and this is definitely considered a mainstream yoga video. There are no mention of asanas, and doesn't put a whole lot of weight on the final calming grounding exercises most yoga instructors do. However, She does put a lot of weight on not trying to push yourself too far, which is really important when you're pregnant. There are two main sequences- one for hips and one for your back, as well as a bonus partner sequence. I like being able to chose certain stretches my body needs at any given time, and hips and backs are a huge source of pain during pregnancy if you aren't kind to them. I tried 5 different prenatal yoga DVDs, and this one alone is the only one I haven't returned.",1453420800,,913,4.376470588235295
5853799,5,B00DSR6EBG,I have been using this since my third month. Really love it! Nothing too hard but def works you out especially towards the end of your pregnancy and helps me with my tight hips. I would totally recommend.,1452124800,,204,4.394736842105263
5853800,5,B00DSR6EBG,Bought this for my daughter-in-law when she was pregnant. She loved it.,1452038400,,71,5.0

5853802,5,B00DSR6EBG,"This was very good; one of my favorites while pregnant. It's not too demanding, but also not too boring.  I don't love her cuing as she tells you to breathe in and out too much and it was a little annoying/awkward to me.  However, despite that complaint I really did like her and the program.  There are a lot of prenatal yoga DVDs that suck, but this is not one of them so I definitely recommend you get it.",1448755200,5,408,4.139240506329114
5853803,5,B00DSR6EBG,This was a great video that I found really relaxing. I was able to do this all the way up until I delivered a week passed my due date.,1447372800,,134,3.6551724137931036
5853804,5,B00DSR6EBG,"I was looking for a yoga DVD that would provide stretches to alleviate a little bit of my round ligament pain and other pregnancy pains, but most of the prenatal DVDs I found focused more on working out in a way that you could ""bounce back"" more quickly to your pre-pregnancy body once you gave birth. This DVD was perfect! I always feel a lot better after I do the workouts provided, and Hilaria is a good instructor. I highly recommend this DVD for any pregnant woman with back or hip pain.",1447027200,3,492,4.358695652173913

5853806,4,B00DSR6EBG,Loved this workout while I was pregnant. It really helped with my flexibility and lower back pain. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a easier workout with lots of stretching.,1445299200,,190,4.787878787878788
5853807,3,B00DSR6EBG,"Hilaria talks a little fast and she moves through some of the poses too quickly, so you don't really get a good sense of the stretch. My main criticism is that there is no separate ""warm up"" section. You can play the entire video (almost an hour) and you will get a warm up at the beginning, before she moves into the various routines. But if you only want to do one section, like ""hip openers"", it just jumps right into it. I tried doing that section without first warming up, and my toes immediately cramped up. For pregnant ladies especially, the warm up is so important.",1444521600,,574,4.373831775700935
5853808,5,B00DSR6EBG,Short and sweet to the point exercise sequences. I never had much time to fit in exercise let alone energy when I was pregnant and this film had 15 minute workouts that you could choose from that were specific to the areas you needed to target. Great for any mom to be. Gentle exercise and good options for different levels from beginning to intermediate depending on which you prefer to follow and what trimester you are in.,1443398400,2,425,4.532467532467533
5853809,3,B00DSR6EBG,"I agree with other reviewers that this dvd is really meant for people with prior knowledge and experience with yoga. I am not a former or current yoga enthusiast (nor am I terribly flexible), but I was looking for something low key, like gentle stretching and toning that I could do at home during my pregnancy. This dvd isn't really what I was hoping for; it's basically just regular yoga being done by a pregnant yoga expert.",1443225600,2,427,4.558441558441558
5853810,1,B00DSR6EBG,"She talks way to fast and needs to slow down, exspecially if your on third trimester like I am. Not that great",1442880000,4,110,4.045454545454546

5853812,5,B00DSR6EBG,"I love this pre-natal yoga video. She doesn't get all weird like some other pre-natal yogis. It's to the point, not too difficult, and my backs and hips feel much better after practicing with Hilaria.",1441756800,,200,4.742857142857143
5853813,3,B00DSR6EBG,I was hoping there would be more. I started it during my first trimester and its only an hour long and there's no option for any variety. I'm at 17 weeks and am now looking for something more interesting,1440115200,,203,4.230769230769231
5853814,4,B00DSR6EBG,Great video! Yoga for all stages of pregnancy. Lots of options. Loved it!,1439251200,,73,4.6923076923076925
5853815,2,B00DSR6EBG,"I was disappointed by this video overall. Others have mentioned that you should have some prior yoga knowledge as she uses jargon which is certainly true but it seems you should have been an avid practitioner of yoga before as well. I have enough yoga experience to understand the jargon, but did not practice yoga regularly so I felt she moved through the moves at too fast a pace. I was looking for a more relaxed video similar to other pre-natal yoga classes I have taken and this was not it. If you have already practiced yoga and are comfortable moving so quickly, then it might work better for you.",1438819200,4,604,4.5
5853816,4,B00DSR6EBG,"I do like this video.  Hilaria is easy to listen to and not too over the top.  I know nothing about yoga and there were a few terms that I had to look up like ""Sit Bone"" but they weren't too hard to figure out.  You will need yoga blocks and a pillow for these workouts.",1438041600,,270,3.7857142857142856
5853817,4,B00DSR6EBG,"I was looking for a prenatal yoga/stretch DVD that focuses on yoga and stretching as opposed to focusing on being quiet and bonding with baby. (I don't need instruction for that!) This DVD has made a world of difference for me. I've used it throughout my second and third trimester. I use the hip opener routine almost daily. I also like the other two routines. I have some minor exposure to yoga, so I know the basic poses, and I enjoy stretching. I found the pace to be just right. The length is also perfect for me. My only criticism is that the instructor's verbal prompts are opposite from the visual prompts. In other words, she tells you to put your left foot forward while she is putting her right foot forward. Perhaps other people are used to that, but I'm not. If you miss the verbal cue then you need to do the stretch on the opposite side of what she is demonstrating. Recommended equipment: Yoga mat, block (or two), pillows.",1436054400,,939,4.465116279069767

5853821,2,B00DSR6EBG,"Not really.  The jokes fall flat, many not even jokes.  Like some kind of workout DVD and not the standup comedy show I was expecting.  Her telling of ""the aristocrats"" bit was pretty good though.",1429747200,,196,4.542857142857143

It's easy to follow and understand, and I liked that each session was only about 23 min long, or combined close to an hour. They also have 3 different people showing the different poses and ways to modify during the entire video. That really in handy.
The only con was I was kinda distracted at first by how low cut Hilaria's shirt was! I kept waiting for her to fall out, but got used to it after awhile.",1425513600,,584,4.36697247706422

5853830,4,B00DSR6EBG,I like this video the best of the 2 pre natal ones I bought.  I am very flexible to begin with and found it to be just right.  My other video used a chair for even basic poses which I found annoying.  May not be right for inflexible or beginner yogi pregnant mommas.  I dropped a star because I found her voice to not be very relaxing or soothing.  I got used to it after a couple times but it seemed rushed though the poses didn't seem so.  Odd.  I also couldn't do the partner section with my partner.  It seemed awkward.,1421539200,,523,4.0588235294117645

5853834,5,B00DSR6EBG,Great dvd. It really helped me loosen up in the 3rd trimester. I wish I had been doing this all along!,1418860800,,102,3.9047619047619047
5853835,5,B00DSR6EBG,I love this yoga dvd!  I like how you can pick which workout options you want to do.,1418083200,,84,3.6666666666666665
5853836,3,B00DSR6EBG,"It is acceptable everyday exercise routine, however for me it lacked an element of better pre-warmth exercises. Especially, if you are not following through the whole routine and jump in from the part 2 or part 3, it feels that many stretches are done on the cold & tight muscles which might be quite dangerous during pregnancy.
In fact, then doing one particular stretch from the Part 2 (Hip stretch) I've managed to pull something in my tailbone area and couldn't walk after it for 3 days. Some of these stretches are pretty intense whilst other parts of the body are not worked on at all,
I would recommend to combine this routine with 2 other more varied fitness routines, but not to rely solely on this one during your pregnancy.",1417392000,,734,4.6106870229007635
5853837,5,B00DSR6EBG,My wife loved this workout.  She says the models demonstrate the exercises well depending on what stage of pregnancy you are in.  She highly recommends this video.,1416614400,,163,5.0

5853839,3,B00DSR6EBG,"This isn't a bad prenatal yoga video, it's just missing a few things that would make it my go-to. I do love that she has separate sessions that target specific concerns of pregnant women. There is one for stress, one for hips, and one for back, and each are helpful. The main thing that I feel this DVD is missing though is a good, relaxing, every day session. I used Elements Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga during my first pregnancy (lent it to a friend who never gave it back - I'll be buying another one), and it was a great standby that I used several times a week. That in combination with this DVD to address specific issues, would be the perfect fit.

As for the instructor, she moves a bit quickly for my taste - I feel like I could benefit from a little more time in each pose - but she is pleasant to listen to and gives helpful commentary.",1414368000,2,845,4.216049382716049

5853842,5,B00DSR6EBG,Surprisingly the best yoga video I've ever owned- and I own many. Instruction is precise and delivered in non irritating manner.,1413331200,,128,5.142857142857143
5853843,1,B00DSR6EBG,"It may be good for some people, however, you will need to be familiar with Yoga already as well as in good yoga shape.  If your core sucks, you're going to want to start somewhere else first.  She also goes very fast, which for pros is probably a good thing, but if you're relatively new with very little floor space in your home it doesn't really work.  I will be finding a friend to give it to, or maybe even trying to return it if they would take it back.  I'll look for something for out of shape beginners for pregnancy.  The more specialized, probably the harder to find, eh?",1413072000,4,581,4.245454545454545
5853844,4,B00DSR6EBG,"Love the partner stretches....wish that was a bit longer. I like the fact that they show modifications for each trimester, however the pace is a little fast and not that relaxing. Some of the transitions can make you a little dizzy. All in all a good work out and easy enough for beginners with little to no yoga experience.",1412294400,,324,4.508474576271187
5853845,2,B00DSR6EBG,"I couldn't use this DVD at all.  I turned it on, tried a move or two in the first trimester and couldn't follow along.  I was terribly sick and weak and wanted a good stretching routine, but this was NOT that :/",1412208000,,211,4.0
5853846,5,B00DSR6EBG,"I've been doing yoga for years but this was a lot of new modifications that made it more exciting! I thought it was pretty gentle but if you don't have the flexibility it would probably be difficult.  It was a good pace, you hold poses for just the right amount of time and she does a good job focusing on breathing.  It's does wonders for your back!",1411171200,,350,4.208955223880597
5853847,4,B00DSR6EBG,"Happily surprised by this DVD. It has three nice length sections 13 min + on relaxation, hips and back. Plus a partner section. I found she gave clear instruction, and it's nice to have the 3 trimesters represented with the 3 models. I'm a bit uncomfortable with some of the lying on the back part at the end of some sections. But, they can be modified to fit.",1410998400,,360,4.3088235294117645
5853848,2,B00DSR6EBG,"This is NOT a dvd for women with beginner yoga skills. It's a fast routine with intermediate+ yoga positions. For women who are fairly inexperienced with yoga, this is not for you - find something else. As an aside, Hilaria and Alec Baldwin's interactions are quite uncomfortable and awkward to watch in the partner sequence. For the other sequences, Hilaria's voice is slightly annoying with emphasis on every ""s"" possible. If you're a fan this might not bother you but for the average person it's quite distracting.",1410825600,,517,4.954022988505747
5853849,4,B00DSR6EBG,"This is one of my favorite prenatal yoga DVDs.  The pacing is excellent, the suggested props are pillows and yoga blocks (things you probably already have in the house), and the stretches and timing are appropriate for all trimesters.  My only complaint is that it is broken down into three segments.  When you watch them all in a row, you have three savasanas, and three endings, which can make it hard to get up and going for another segment.",1409961600,2,444,4.594936708860759
5853850,5,B00DSR6EBG,"Love this workout DVD! I had only done yoga a few times before getting pregnant, and I've always heard yoga is a great way to stay in shape and prepare for delivery. Yoga classes in my city are very expensive, so I purchased this DVD based on the good reviews and I wasn't disappointed! There are fairly short segments to focus on strengthening your back, opening your hips, and general stress relief. The total workout time is about an hour if you do all three segments. I started using it around 3 months and I felt like it was fairly easy but a good stretch and worth doing. Now at 5 months pregnant it is a bit more challenging, but they show modifications for many moves which is helpful. Overall I highly recommend!",1409875200,2,721,4.428571428571429

5853853,4,B00DSR6EBG,"I was too sick to work out much during my pregnancy,  but I did enjoy this DVD.  It was simple and gentle,  but was a good flow to stretch and open the hips and other areas that tighten up during pregnancy.  Hilaria's guidance was easy to understand and just quiet/soothing enough without crossing into the cheesy yoga video that some at home practices seem to end up having.  This was gentle enough to do at 7 months,  though with a huge belly might not be as comfortable.  (She does suggest modifications for this if you're further along.)  It felt good to stretch and move,  and I think it was a good prenatal practice.  I do wish I had known it involved the user of blocks and pillows/cushions though- had to improvise a bit.",1408320000,,729,4.413533834586466
5853854,4,B00DSR6EBG,This is a great relaxing video.. I'm only in my first trimester so it seems slightly too easy right now for moderate level yoga lover but it's nice to stretch out,1407628800,,162,4.258064516129032
5853855,3,B00DSR6EBG,"Really great poses and workout. However, I've been doing yoga for years, and she moves through the poses much too quickly for regular yoga let alone pregnancy.

5853857,5,B00DSR6EBG,The only thing keeping me sane during my pregnancy.  Without this DVD I would be miserable and achy.  I do 1 workout every day and I have no major aches! Easy enough to do throughout but still feels like you are challenged.  Highly recommend.,1406246400,,242,4.454545454545454
5853858,3,B00DSR6EBG,These three segments are mellow and offer a nice stretch for pregnant women.  I was disappointed that there's no way to skip to a particular segment through video on demand but it's a good prenatal offering.,1402185600,3,207,4.75
5853859,3,B00DSR6EBG,"Prenatal yoga was recommended by my midwife. Unfortunately, the only local classes are in a time slot that I can't make it to. So I decided to try this prenatal yoga dvd.

Pros:

* Includes models showing you how to alter each workout depending on your trimester.

* The music is peaceful and non-intrusive.

* Hilaria is friendly and easy to understand.

Cons:

If you have no prior yoga knowledge, this DVD may not be for you. It is riddled with yoga references (sit bones, neutral spine, various position names).

I would have given this 5 stars if there had been a section included for beginners, something that explained the terms and described how to achieve proper posture in all the positions.",1402099200,21,701,4.69672131147541
5853860,5,B00DSR6EBG,"I had never tried yoga before but figured it was worth a try when I was experiencing so much stiffness and aches and pains with this pregnancy. I have been very pleasantly surprised by how much this DVD has helped alleviate a lot of those issues. It's broken in to 20 minute segments so not too overwhelming or time consuming to do. And the instructor is very clear. I've seen snippets of other yoga DVDs in the past where the instructors were very annoying and the whole thing was far too New Age-y for me, for lack of a more suitable description. That is not the case with Hilaria Baldwin, she is very calming and precise, the video overall is relaxing and has served its purpose for me in relieving my pain.",1401753600,,710,4.386363636363637

5853864,3,B00DSR6EBG,"This is a nice, relaxing yoga dvd.  I'm used to yoga workouts that make me sweat and get my heart-rate going, and this is definitely not one of those.  I think I will really enjoy this during the last trimester when I don't feel like doing anything and my belly is huge.  In the meantime, it will be a good dvd to use once or twice a week just to stretch and relax in the evenings once the kids are in bed.",1395014400,,406,3.926829268292683
5853865,4,B00DSR6EBG,"This is a perfectly fine workout. The lengths of the segments -- 13 to 23 minutes -- are nice, and the focus on the lower back and hips is smart. The instruction is solid. She speaks and moves quickly, which doesn't bother me, but may not be right for some. (She does have a slight baby-voice thing happening, though.) I'm not sure I would really call it a yoga practice; it's a straightforward stretching and strengthening program that integrates a few elements from yoga. It doesn't have the deeper focus on integrating the mental and the physical and promoting overall well-being that you'd find in something like the Hala Hkouri DVDs.",1394928000,,638,4.756756756756757

My back and hips were killing me this morning and after I did the back relief session I feel so much better. I recommend this DVD for any expecting mother.

I have to admit I had really high hopes for this DVD but I am not completely impressed. I have never done Yoga before so I'm not familiar with the poses and some of the things she says. While that isn't a big deal, all I have to do is practice more, she also talks extremely fast and I feel rushed doing all of the poses. I do like how the menu is set up so I can pick and choose what I want to focus on. It also tells you the length of each section so you know how much time you need to finish it.

I alternate the hip section one day, back the next.  Each section is 23 minutes so it's long enough to feel like you did a good workout but short enough to fit it into a busy day.  I was in good shape before pregnancy so I was able to make it through each section with no issues.  She is relaxing but not cheesy.  Definitally get some yoga blocks, they make a huge difference.
