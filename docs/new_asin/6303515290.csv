670297,3,6303515290,"The movie is full of action of guns, shooting, and suspense, yet it lacks the feel of a good action movie.  Of general feeling, it could have been made better. Why would I write - Det-On Actor becuase it was just that Det-On of Acting of

Patrick Stewart and Bronson.  Everthing was predictiable and of course nothing worked to stop the train till the end of the movie.  I would rather wait till you can rent it than buy it and spend the money.",1125273600,,444,4.25
670298,1,6303515290,"The Detonator was quite possibly the worst movie that I have ever had the unfortunate oppurtunity to watch. Not to mention the most dullest.  The acting was horrible, the dialoge weak, and everyone ran around like a chicken with its head cut off. I found myself rooting for Christpher Lee just to pull the plug, and explode the darn bomb.

Nothing went right, and the entire experience made you come away with the feeling that you could have done a better job, had the director merely handed the script over. Do yourself a favor, and don't even bother renting this movie, the time spent over it is definatly not a good way to spend those precious minutes of your life.",1109548800,5,668,4.558333333333334
670299,4,6303515290,"The cast elevates this 3-star movie to 4 stars. Patrick Stewart, always a tour de force in the acting department, takes command of his role as the intelligent operations manager/mediator who nonetheless underestimates his opponent. Pierce Brosnan, who always brings a human vulnerability to his heroism, slips into James Bond mode. Alexandra Paul does a credible job of portraying a sharpshooter whose raw determination is matched by her female intuition. Ted Levine is flawless as the cocky mercenary. And Christopher Lee nails his role as the Russian evildoer. The performance of these actors is not wasted. The film is intelligent and suspenseful. I cannot fault the direction or camerawork. The soundtrack is understated, so that the film is more ""real world"" than ""dramatic."" DETONATOR is a good film, and its solid cast of actors makes it worth a repeat viewing.",1098230400,16,868,5.207142857142857
670300,3,6303515290,"I saw the movie under the TV name of ""Death Train"". Pierce Brosnan and Patrick Stewart drew me to it, as did the espionage + action thriller theme, although I'm still unsure if an entity called United Nations Anti Crime Unit is simply a Hollywood contraption.

Some plutonium has been stolen from a German nuclear reactor station and being carried via a hijacked train, which sets off a wild goose chase for who the REAL thief is and what the ulterior motives + destination are. We're told about these perpetrators and their intentions about 75% into the film (let me not spoil it) but the action on/off the train to stop it in its tracks before detonation, is fairly engaging. The negotiation moments are superbly done.

Pierce Brosnan was perhaps fresh off Remington Steele so he has a suitably sharp female colleague to woo and wheedle. If people were scouting for a new James Bond circa 1993, I can totally see why Brosnan came up well reviewed.

A very watchable, well-made popcorn thriller.",1094860800,13,996,4.745664739884393
670301,1,6303515290,"This ""action"" movie was quite frankly the WORST movie I have ever seen.  The dialog was completely predictable, the plot was basically non-existant (a Soviet general wants to send a nuclear bomb to Iraq to make  the Russians invade it and restore the USSR... huh?), the acting was a step  below Jake Lloyd's (I'm shocked that Patrick Steward would even consider  appearing in such a cheesy flick), and even the ""action"" was  pathetic; a few gunshots on a rusty train.  Oh, and don't look for the  soundtrack--it was composed on the director's Apple II.  Save yourself the  agony; don't watch ""Detonator!""",964828800,2,604,4.900990099009901
670302,4,6303515290,"I have this one in my video library too.
I loved this one, but it could have been a little longer.
I think this character is alot like Bond, but he doesn't wear the fancy clothes.
He shows a bit of male chauvinism, but  not too much for the times.
This role helped him get prepared for playing  the world's greatest secret agent.
In the end, Mike and Sabrina do become  friends, and you see an attraction between the two of them.
He deserves  this great role as 007.  God only knows it took him long enough to get it.",928454400,8,517,4.13

Can this train be stopped?  Or will Europe be GONE?  Patrick Stewart shines as MALCOLM FILLPOT in this heart-stopping thriller filled with action, explosions, frizzy hair, product placement, Floridian terrorists, and classic 90s sexism.

7849360,5,6303515290,"Fine combo: Stewart, Brosnan, Lee. Christopher Lee was outstanding as the rogue Soviet general; his fluency in Russian and the deep bass voice, along with his superb acting, made his role as the unstoppable detonator a superb performance. A stellar example of the genre.",1436140800,,270,5.159090909090909

7849363,3,6303515290,"Detonator-also called Death Train-is an odd film with a strange, almost silly plot, some decent action scenes and an excellent cast of supporting actors. Be warned. Despite what you see on the cover, Patrick Stewart and Pierce Brosnon are not the leads. That spot comes to Alexandria Paul in the role of a naive but talented rookie agent. The film is also blessed to have Christopher Lee as the main bad guy. Lee plays a Russian general who is still a Communist at heart. It's a superb bit of casting and Lee gives what should have been an empty role a great deal of depth. Detonator may be worth a shot if you buy it in the discount bin but I would not pay a good deal of money for the DVD or go out of my way to watch it. Brosnon is fine as always in the role of a cocky hero. Stewart is barely in the film and has a cast on an arm, which he explains is the result of boxing some African Americans who think the English are wimps up in Harlem in one of the oddest lines of his long career. All in all, a forgettable film for the most part which can be watched due to a wonderful supporting cast all out to get paychecks.",1233532800,2,1122,4.081447963800905
7849364,2,6303515290,"Patrick Stewart is in charge of a special unit within the United Nations. He enlists the help of Pierce Brosnan, an old friend who apparently owes him one last favor, to go after a Russian general played by Christopher Lee. Lee has had a German scientist build two nuclear bombs. His purpose is to get them to Iraq and detonate them so the Russian military can come in and easily take over the region, thus restoring Russia to world prominence. His henchmen, led by Ted Levine, take over a train in Germany to transport the bombs. It all sounds slightly better than it plays out.

There are a lot of good actors in this movie cashing a paycheck. They can't do much with the poor dialogue and badly constructed scenes. Being an action movie, there is plenty of shooting and plenty of no one hitting the broad side of a barn. Several attempts at stopping the train fail, leading to hostages being shot. Overall, Detonator is pretty tepid. Not the worst movie you'll ever see, but I don't think its too high on the resume of anyone involved.",1156809600,4,1038,4.5212765957446805
