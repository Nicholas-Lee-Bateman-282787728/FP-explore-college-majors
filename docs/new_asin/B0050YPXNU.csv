8452038,5,B0050YPXNU,"The DVD is great! However, it originally aired on PBS. Call your local PBS and see if they still have it. I paid a 5 dollar donation and they sent me the DVD. Not worth the 62 dollars it's going for on here.",1459814400,,207,3.8372093023255816
8452039,5,B0050YPXNU,"I bought this DVD a few years ago right after a trip to Las Vegas where I saw three Cirque du Soleil shows on three consecutive nights. We saw Viva Elvis first,The Beatles Love the next night and Ka on the third night. All three shows were amazing and very different from all the other Cirque shows I had seen in the past. I would highly recommend them all but sadly Viva Elvis closed right after we saw it. C'mon! Elvis,Cirque du Soleil,Las Vegas? I can't imagine why it wasn't a success.",1440806400,,489,4.326086956521739

8452041,5,B0050YPXNU,I'm s fan of cirque and seen all these shows live in Vegas so this is a good DVD to show friends that can't decide which show to see when they go to Vegas since there are 6 Cirque shows in Vegas this helps narrow down their choices.,1414800000,,232,3.8541666666666665
8452042,5,B0050YPXNU,"This is one of the best cirque DVD's. It is a great overview of the Vegas shows, has some great show footage.  If you can get it, do so.",1381881600,,136,3.689655172413793
8452043,4,B0050YPXNU,"This is a great DVD with fairly large chunks of several of the Cirque's most famous current shows.  The portions of Mystere and Love are so amazing, it makes you want to go to Las Vegas and see the show.  I bought this originally to see more footage of their show called Love, which is based on Beatles music.  I ended up buying the documentary called Love which is about the Beatles/Cirque collaboration.  Both Love and Flowers in the Desert are great DVD additions for fans of Cirque du Soleil.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the excerpts are not the whole of any of the shows, it is a sampler, but it's still an enjoyable disk.",1309305600,5,654,4.327868852459017
