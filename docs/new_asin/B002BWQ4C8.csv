8 is one of the best ones so far.....

3898985,3,B002BWQ4C8,"As a VERY selective viewer of Network Television, this series was another
that I only began to watch in its syndication.

It immediately grabbed my attention with its brilliant writing, and excellent
acting. What further amazed me as the seasons went on.....was that each
successive actor (of which there were many), seemed BETTER than the last!

Well, all good things must come to the end I guess......

This season compilation (#8) is the first that was somewhat dissapointing.
The scripts are WEAK, although the acting still very good.
I kept watching each episode, hoping that the next storyline would improve.
Unfortunately that was not the case. I can only hope that the writing gets
better for the following seasons.

That said.....Law and Order is STILL one of the best shows ever produced.",1298160000,3,798,5.0227272727272725

One glaring drawback was the cases this particular season (Season 8) came in.  The ""teeth"" that are supposed to ""hold the DVD in place were broken so that I had to purchase spare DVD cases to safely hold the DVDs.

3899065,5,B002BWQ4C8,"Law and Order Season 8 is one of the best of its long run.  What makes this series so good this season is the great chemistry between the actors and the storylines are well written, never dull or predictable.

Cary Lowell especially shines in season eight.  She is compassionate, principled,smart and expressive.  Her face displays the gamut of her emotions.

Jerry Orbach, always witty, is even better in season eight.  He has the same dry humor but also deals with his daughter's addiction and arrest.  This softer side of Lenny as he is trying to connect with his daughter is some of his best work.

Season eight has some of the best plotted shows in Law and Order history.  Cary Lowell (Attorney Jamie Ross) is brilliant in the episode that confronts the horrible practice of female genital mutilation; this is groundbreaking in a crime drama.  She is also marvelous in the episode where her integrity is on the line for a mentally ill defendant.

Law and Order has never shied away from controversial topics and the moral questions that haunt the characters.  Season eight has episodes that confront assisted suicide, child abuse, paparazzi and the first amendment, and the death penalty.  Adam Schiff is in an election year and the politics of his DA office and reelection are yet another factor in the disposition of cases.

An added bonus is the addition of the Homicide Life on the Streets episode with Briscoe and Curtis along with Sam Waterson traveling to Baltimore to investigate the terrible death of a teenaged model.  Lenny has great rapport with Detective Munch and tells Munch how alike they are. ""You wear a badge and avenge the dead."" Well said, Lenny.

Sam Watterson is his usual pragmatic self, a dedicated district attorney who pushes the law to its limits.  And of course, Benjamin Bratt is also quite good, a man who has a strong moral compass but must wrestle with guilt after he and Lenny screw up an investigation of a woman who is stalked.  Both Bratt and Lenny's emotions are in full force in this episode (Stalker).

Finally S. Epatha Merkerson, the calm controlled police lieutenant is just as sterling as she was in previous seasons. Her no nonsense attitude and street smarts are well acted.

This was Cary Lowell's last year and I was sorry to see her go.  She was a bright star in this very good series.",1423180800,3,2339,4.725925925925926

As always, there are stories that are riffed from the headlines, such as the murder of a fast-food delivery man, teenagers who kill their newborn son, the 1997 Air Force sex scandal, a segment from ""60 Minutes"", the siege of Waco, the JonBenet Ramsey case, the life story of Anatole Broyard, female circumcision, the Andrew Cunanan case, the case of a man who raped and impregnated a comatose woman, the Sammy Gravano case, the Nushawn Williams case and the Carla Faye Tucker case. The few scripts that were not based on the newspapers were all as good as ever; one was written by actor Alec Baldwin. There are lots and lots of superbly competent guest stars such as Robert Vaughan and Jill Clayburgh. ADA Jack McCoy has to pull yet more rabbits out of hats to get convictions, and the jurors don't always vote as one might wish.

3899136,5,B002BWQ4C8,"Season opens with a bang! Literally. It makes sort of an impact showing kids who're wannabe gangsters kill a delivery boy and the involvement of the Catholic Church on confessions. This season seems to have a lot wise-asses and more so than usual in Law & Order. Also just about every episode covered sickening topics such as drunk driving and the raping a mentally challenged high school student to controversial topics like militias, the intentional spreading of aids/HIV and female circumcision. This seasons marks the second time Law & Order crosses over with Homicide: Life On The Streets with Detectives John Munch(played Richard Belzer) and Paul Falsone(played by John Seda) helping out the 27th Detectives and NY County ADA's who later go to Baltimore in the Homicide episode the close the case. Also this is Carey Lowell's ADA Jamie Ross's last season as a series regular. She guest stars in seasons 10 and 11 and as of the spin-off, Law & Order: Trial By Jury, she has become a judge. There was a lot of personal insight brought into the character development this season. Without giving too much away, Adam is up for reelection, Jamie gets involved in custody battle, Jack crosses the line, Anita sues the department, Rey's wife is diagnosed with MS and Lennie's kid gets in a jam. The series finale was centered around the actions the main cast had took throughout the season and how it came back to bite them in most cases. Buy this season, because the episodes are memorable, well plotted and well written and definitely includes highlights of not only the characters of the current season, but also of series as well.

Anyway, the picture quality is excellent on my big flat screen TV. The main reason for deducting one star is due to the cheaper packaging and the lack of any extra features AGAIN! Shame on Dick Wolf for the lack of extras. Too cheap to take the time, I guess.",1361750400,,611,4.321739130434783
3899138,4,B002BWQ4C8,"Because I am a HUGE fan of Benjamin Bratt (hence my screen-name!) the seasons where he appears (Seasons 6, 7, 8 & 9) are my ABSOLUTE FAVORITES (though since I really like Jill Hennessy/Claire Kincaid, I LOVE Seasons 4 and 5 as well) of the ENTIRE 20-season series of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order/dp/B005HU0TBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order</a>

There are some seasons of Law & Order which are my favorites, and other seasons which I do NOT really like -- and its all based on the particular cast of characters (and actors/actresses) during that season.

I have many FAVORITE characters on the show, including Rey Curtis (obviously!), Jamie Ross, Claire Kincaid, Anita van Buren, Lennie Briscoe & Jack McCoy (of course!), Mike Logan, Abbie Carmichael, Ben Stone and Adam Schiff, and I LOVE the seasons they are in. But by the same token, I HATE Arthur Branch, Kevin Bernard, Cyrus Lupo & Ed Green, and I don't really like the characters of Michael Cutter, Serena Southerlyn, Alexandra Borgia, Connie Rubirosa, Nick Falco, Joe Fontana or Nina Cassady very much, so I HATE (or don't care very much for) the seasons that they are in.

Also, though I liked the CHARACTERS of Max Greevey, Phil Cerreta, Don Cragen & Paul Robinette, because there were NO women characters in the main cast, during  the seasons in which they appeared (Seasons 1, 2, and 3) the show was way too male-heavy/male-centric. Which is why I do NOT like the first three seasons of the show, and its the reason that even though I liked Greevey, Cerreta & Robinette, and I LOVE Don Cragen on Law & Order SVU, I was glad when their characters were replaced with females (Claire Kincaid for Paul Robinette and Anita van Buren for Don Cragen)

So basically, I do NOT like either the first three seasons of the show, nor *most* of the episodes after Season 9 (though there are individual episodes after that, which I DO like!). Seasons 4-9 are my favorites in this series, and barring any massive price reduction and/or multi-season ""bundling"" discounts, they are the ONLY seasons I plan to get on DVD.

Out of the 6 seasons (4, 5, 6, 7, 8 & 9) I plan to get, so far, I have gotten the DVD sets for Seasons 7, 8 and 9 (though I did not get them from Amazon -- I can't remember now, exactly where I got them, probably Best Buy [or Circuit City, when they were still in business], or Kmart or the like) and I LOVE Season 8!

This 5-disc DVD set contains all 24 episodes of the 8th season (which aired in 1997-98) including the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order/dp/B005HU0TBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order</a>&nbsp;crossover episode with the award-winning series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Homicide-Life-on-the-Street/dp/B002BLNGTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Homicide: Life on the Street</a>, titled, ""Baby, It's You"", which was the 2nd of the 3 occasions when these two shows had ""crossover episodes"" with each other.

Just like in other seasons, the episodes in Season 8 are full of gripping cases that are often ""ripped from the headlines"" like the episodes, ""Thrill (which was based on the Thomas Koskovich & Jayson Vreeland case), ""Denial"" (which was based on the Melissa Drexler and Amy Grossberg & Brian Peterson cases), ""Navy Blues"" (which was inspired by the 1997 U.S. Air Force sex scandal involving Lt. Kelly Flynn), ""Castoff"" (which was based on the Andrew Cunanan case), and ""Nullification"" (which was inspired by Militia actions such as the Siege of Ruby Ridge and Waco, Texas, the Oklahoma City bombing and the trial of the Chicago Seven) as well as the ""crossover episode"" with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Homicide-Life-on-the-Street/dp/B002BLNGTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Homicide: Life on the Street</a>, ""Baby, Its You""(which was based on the JonBent Ramsey case).

Also, just as in other seasons,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order-Season-Eight/dp/B002BWQ4C8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order: Season Eight</a>&nbsp;has many notable guest stars including Heather Matarazzo, Edie Falco, Kate Walsh, Emmy Rossum, Ana Gasteyer, Jill Clayburgh, Vera Farmiga, and many others, as well as Richard Belzer in his best-known role of Detective John Munch on ""Homicide - Life on the Street"" & several other series. In addition, the episode ""Tabloid"" was co-written with Oscar Award nominee, Alec Baldwin. Joining together with these wonderful guest stars are the EXCELLENT series regulars including Benjamin Bratt, Jerry Orbach, S. Epatha Merkerson, Carey Lowell (who had her last appearance as ADA Jamie Ross, at the the end of this season) Sam Waterston, and Steven Hill.

While I LOVE nearly all (if not, ALL) of the episodes in this season, I'd have to say that my MOST FAVORITE episode this season is a three-way tie between ""Thrill"", ""Nullification"" and ""Ritual"". Other favorites include ""Denial"", ""Harvest"", ""Under the Influence"", ""Carrier"", ""Stalker"", ""Disappeared"", ""Damaged"" and ""Monster"".

Also even though I LOVE this DVD set, I still DO have a couple complaints about it. The first (and IMHO, the biggest) problem with this set is the HORRIBLE packaging -- which is one of the main reasons I gave this set 4 stars instead of 5 stars. I ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY HATE cardboard DVD boxes, or for that matter, ANY style of DVD cases that involves cardboard!

Rather than a cardboard DVD box holding individual plastic DVD cases (the style used for THIS set, as well as for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order-The-Seventh-Year/dp/B002UOMGWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order: The Seventh Year</a>) I much PREFER the single plastic DVD case with an inner tray-rack to hold the discs (like the DVD case for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order-The-Ninth-Year/dp/B00466H37M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order: The Ninth Year</a>) instead! I am kind of anal about my DVD sets, and I HATE the cardboard box style of DVD case which often gets worn, scuffed, and/or peeling at the edges and corners of the box. In my experience so far, plastic DVD cases do NOT have those problems -- at most, the clear plastic sheet on the outside of the DVD case (into which the paper cover is inserted) *might* get a little wrinkled or soiled/dusty.

But the few wrinkles or soiling on the plastic cases is at least something I can live with, UNLIKE the scuffing & peeling into white spots/patches on the corners & edges of cardboard cases, which is really aggravating! Which is why I'd much rather have a single plastic DVD case, which doesn't get edgewear, shelfwear and corner-wear, scuffing & peeling, and is pretty much care-free!

My other complaint with this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order-Season-Eight/dp/B002BWQ4C8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order: Season Eight</a>&nbsp;DVD set, is that there are NO Special Features or Bonuses (other than the 2nd part of the 2-part crossover episode with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Homicide-Life-on-the-Street/dp/B002BLNGTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Homicide: Life on the Street</a>). NO deleted scenes, NO bloopers, no commentary, no interviews with cast or producers/directors, no trailers, NOTHING!

It's really disappointing!

When people buy DVDs (especially for TV shows), many times its so that they can get special features that they would NOT otherwise be able to get, just from taping the shows off of TV broadcasts. So DVD manufacturers should really take that into consideration, and include at least a few extras to make it worth buying a DVD set. Even cheaper priced DVD sets (like Full House and Who's the Boss?) have some special features which generally are part of the allure of buying a DVD set. I mean seriously, something, anything would be nice. Deleted scenes, bloopers, trailers, interviews with the cast and crew. Something. Anything. Just some extras to make it worth the $20 or $30+ retail price!

But aside from the HORRIBLE packaging, and the lack of any Special Features or bonuses, this DVD set is still a GREAT (though very BASIC) set. Even though&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order/dp/B005HU0TBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order</a>&nbsp;airs often in syndication and/or on cable, since there are 456 episodes total in the 20-season series, the chance of having a desired episode airing at any given time is very slim (though for those with Netflix service, seasons 1-8 available for Instant Video Streaming) so for those who love ""Law & Order"", particularly those who are fans of Season 8, this DVD set is a MUST-HAVE!!!",1361059200,2,8900,5.720121028744327

3899158,5,B002BWQ4C8,"Law and Order Season 8 is without a doubt one of the best seasons of the shows 20 year run...and unfortunately the most recent of them all that is available to purchase on dvd...why seasons 9-20 are unavailable is beyond me...

This is the last season of Assistant ADA Jamie Ross (Carie Lowell), working with ADA Jack McCoy...she played the role VERY well...may have even matched the performance of her predecessor Claire Kincaid (Jill Hennessey)...McCoy is brilliant as always, as is Detective Lenny Briscoe...Detective Ray Curtis has completely grown into his character in this season...the chemistry between Briscoe and Curtis is starting to peak...amazing performances all around...and of course Lt Van Buren and DA Adam Schiff...nothing but the best from them as always.

There are a few standout episodes that are truly riveting...and let's keep in mind that this is in the time period when this show was at its pinnacle...I would say between Seasons 5-16 to be exact, but, particularly seasons 6-12 is where this show really enthralls...My personal favorites of Season 8 are as follows:
- Nullification, Baby it's You, Under the Influence, and Monster (the season finale)

You learn a little bit more about the personal lives of the shows characters, without digging too deep and changing the premise of the show...they started to do that a bit by around the 6th season but in the 8th season we get to learn a bit more...and it makes the show just that much better...the occasional cliffhanger type episode is also a real treat...which has been done on a couple occasions prior to season 8, but in this season we get three back to back episodes (one of which takes place in Baltimore and includes Detective Munch, etc)...all in all, a fantastic season full of totally awesome and memorable episodes...what more can you ask for?  The only sad part is Assistant ADA Jamie Ross resigning at the end, however, in season 9 we do get Angie Harmon playing Abby Carmichael as Jack's new female 2nd chair  =)",1308441600,10,2006,4.923076923076923
