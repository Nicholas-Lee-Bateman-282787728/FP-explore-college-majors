7902148,5,6301648412,"A TV space show that i grew up with, i watched this show so faithfully and had most of the offerings of space toys, i still have my Rocket Ship Drinking cup. And had A Louis Marx Space Patrol Play Set!! These shows were live and fun to watch back then and even now. Okay, so the special effects were not up to movie standards, yet, this was live TV and the first Soap/Space opera show to hit the TV screen! I still enjoy the unique effects for us kids with sounds of air ships, ray guns and smoking rockets, and mistakes on live TV!! Nina Bara, (Tonga) use to live close to me and we did send letters back and forth before she passed away. I remember seeing Virginia Hewitt in the move My Dear Secretary with Kirk Douglas as this hot blonde with long hair, then seeing her as Carol in Space Patrol! Yipeeee! These are rare shows, and the fact some of these still exist is so cool. Ed Kemmer was a real WWII Flyer and was captured by the Nazi's and placed in a POW camp, escaped, captured again, then freed when Germany gave up, so Buss Cory really knew the facts of trouble!! These shows were 20th century fun for us kids in the 50's, i mean women who could fly a space ship and with those very, very short skirts!! Ouuu La La, great stuff!!",1353542400,8,1241,4.153526970954357
7902149,5,6301648412,"Space patrol ran from 1950-55. It was one of the best of several early 50's optimistic views of the dawning space/atomic age. More often than not, the scripts and plots were fairly routine, but the view of the future was  marvelous. Ed Kemmer portrayed a marvelous heroic figure in Buzz Correy.  Lynn Osborne did a great job as the psuedo-kid sidekick--though in real  life he dated Marilyn Monroe. Virginia Hewitt and Nina Bara were years  ahead of their time in portraying intelligent, capable women. Sometimes the  shows got into social commentary (ie., ""the Atomic Vault"" in  volume 3) that seemed daring for the time. A great nostalgia tour for those  of us who remember. And a persuasive argument that others had boldly gone  before ""Star Trek."" Roddenberry was a fan according to his  authorized biography. You can still see bits of it in ""Star  Trek.""",925776000,13,859,4.862068965517241
