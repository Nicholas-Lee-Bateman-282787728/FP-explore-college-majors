3921683,5,6304942249,"I love photography, but when I bought my camera I had no idea how to use it. All I knew is how I wanted my pictures to look. I rented this video for 7 days and I watched it a few times and took notes. I can definitely say I know a lot more after 3 hours than I could have ever learned by googling articles online. It answered a ton of questions I already had. All I need now is practice!!",1357776000,,388,3.7439024390243905
3921684,5,6304942249,"I got enough information out of this video to take some amazing shots the next day. I went from not knowing anything about my cameras features, to almost knowing them all. Great video!!",1357689600,,185,4.636363636363637
3921685,5,6304942249,A very good video with clear instructions that seem so logical providing a good understanding of the basics needed with most all situations to capture that special Kodak moment. The instructor explains it in such an elementary approach that anyone can understand; There's subtle humor also provided to prevent boredom. It's the best 2 and half hours I've invested in learning photography. I can already see the world differently through the eye of the camera lens to capture exactly what i see in my pictures. It's well worth the small investment spent.,1356998400,,553,5.021739130434782
3921686,5,6304942249,This video is great for an entry level photographer. The information is well presented and easy to understand through multiple examples. I have been a fan of the podcast for some time and found the 101 video to be just as enjoyable.,1349913600,,232,4.5476190476190474
3921687,3,6304942249,If you just got your camera out of the box and know nothing about photography this might suit you.  I've read quite a bit on photography so it was old information for me.  I found it a little boring.,1323820800,,199,4.076923076923077
3921688,5,6304942249,"I am very new to photography and dslr's.  I have been operating my camera on full auto mode for the past 6 months and have taken some very good photos - I take 100 for every 1 that I really love.  I have bought several books so that I could ""teach myself"" but until now I never understood just how to do what I wanted.  This video - despite being slightly obnoxious, was very informative and he makes it so easy...I would recommend this to all amateur photographers!!  He explains the functions of the camera, focal points (which helped me a lot since I use auto focus and it kept focusing on whatever was closest- like a blade of grass), I learned ways to get more of the blurred background effect, metering, negative space, exposure, composition, ISO, shutter speed and aperture (Most of these I didn't even know what they were let alone how to use them!!)

A+++++  My only wish is that he would put his wedding 101 class on amazon for rent!!",1303257600,,944,4.396551724137931
3921689,5,6304942249,I found Mixology 101 to be a perfect training video for me as a fledgling bartender. What really worked for me was that the video was informative and entertaining. I tried out many of the drinks on my friends and they were  really impressed -- as well as really drunk. I highly recommend this video  to anyone who wants to have fun learning how to mix drinks. It's a blast!,954115200,2,373,4.314285714285714
8368919,1,6304942249,such a waste of time.  watch getting started in digital slr photography by adam barker instead.,1470096000,,95,4.9375
8368920,5,6304942249,This was a great basic coarse in photography video. This was a refresher coarse for me but I got another look at some of the things that I should be in incorporating in my shots.,1411084800,,178,4.114285714285714
8368921,1,6304942249,"I could not even get through the first 20 mins of this guy talking, so I can't even say if there is good info in this video or not. Even if there is, the presentation was just plain bad. This guy has an iTunes show and throughout the part I watched, he talked like he was on the radio. One of those cheesy morning radio shows. Maybe good for iTunes, but bad for video. He constantly drifted WAY off topic, and the 20 mins. of what I saw, could have been covered in less than 3 min. No wonder the video is so long. This takes everything away from what was being said and make him and what he is saying very unbelievable and thin.",1407196800,,628,4.032
8368922,4,6304942249,"Some very handy tips, already knew most of it but still a good refresher for me.  Not really big on slide show type lessons but in this case it worked out okay and was easy enough to follow.",1406764800,,190,4.0
8368923,3,6304942249,"This is worth renting on Amazon if you need to form a basic understanding of photography BUT be warned the presenter tries a bit too hard to be funny so it has a corny and almost annoying feel throughout the presentation(at least for me because he was NOT funny at ALL) Some people may ""get"" his sense of humor (which is simply making corny/silly comments and laughing at his own remarks constantly) and therefore enjoy and rate this higher, but I for one would not watch this again as it was almost painful to sit through the extended duration. I will stick to watching my ""Get the Picture"" series which costs far more to purchase but is a far superior tutorial for learning virtually everything you need to know about photography in an informative and more concise manner with occasional jokes that at least get a chuckle! :)",1395014400,3,827,4.594594594594595
8368924,5,6304942249,"I really liked this video. I only noticed the 'Heh' because other reviewers mentioned it. If I had not read that, I would not have even noticed. It is not annoying if you are really wanting to learn the content and interested in the subject.",1390867200,,241,4.377777777777778
8368925,4,6304942249,"This video actually has a lot of useful information for a novice photographer like myself. I know a little bit but this really helped explain some things about depth of field, ISO, lenses, etc. However, the guy narrating this video is extremely obnoxious. Sorry if you're reading this, guy, but stop laughing at your own ""jokes"" and trying to be funny by fake firing your ""staff"" for making bad computer drawings that you probably did yourself. And please learn the difference between ""accept"" and ""except"" when writing your notes.

If you can block out the annoyances that I described this is actually worth at least renting it for $3 if you are a beginner because I did learn a lot.",1386288000,,684,4.7
8368926,5,6304942249,"Very informative video with a good pace. I've been using DSLRs for over a decade and thought I knew my camera pretty well but I still learned a lot of new things about depth of field, auto focusing, and metering. I wish I would have watched this class right when I started getting into DSLRs, I'd probably be a much better photographer at this point :)",1384905600,,352,4.348484848484849
8368927,2,6304942249,"I found this video to be too basic, too long, and very irritating.

The subjects that are covered are good basic subjects to cover, however I feel that the video is about twice as long as it should be.  The narrator goes on and on talking about himself and unrelated things for too long, I found all of his back-pedaling to be very irritating.

I fell asleep in the middle of the video and had to come back later to finish it.  I think this video could have been condensed into thirty minutes and would have been much better.

Any of the concepts in the video can be discovered for free on You-Tube or by searching the internet.

Other people seem to like it, so don't take my word for it, this is just my nit-picky opinion.",1372118400,,724,4.248175182481752
8368928,5,6304942249,I really enjoyed this video and learned A LOT! This guy also has a website and a podcast that I now follow. If you are serious about learning photography u need to see this video and check out this guys website!!!!!!!,1360886400,,217,4.317073170731708
