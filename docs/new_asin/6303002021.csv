7834417,4,6303002021,"I recently learned about Marschner and his place in the development of German opera on our local classical music radio station. Eager to sample some of his work, I came across this version through searching Amazon. I had hoped to find a traditional presentation of the work but though this worth a try, especially since my wife enjoys vampire novels and movies.

We were both highly entertained. Some interesting nuances to the standard vampire mythology were presented and the music and singing were enjoyable. Some parts were downright hillarious, like the aria sung while the driver was stuck in traffic. I suppose some lyrics of Wagner and Verdi are the equivalent of the banal ""Damn it, can't you move any faster?"", they just sound more profound when sung in German or Italian.

On the negative side, I think they overdid the nudity and soft porn scenes a bit. Also, a major plot point of the friend not being able to reveal the vampire's identity for twenty-four hours was omitted.",1348531200,,987,4.834319526627219
7834418,5,6303002021,"This charming adaptation of Heinrich Marschner's 1828 opera _Der Vampyr_, with updated setting and libretto by Charles Hart (librettist of Andrew Lloyd-Webber's _Phantom of the Opera_), camps up the original story for the sake of satire, while keeping the same basic storyline, and it works.
What is more important, in my opinion, about this performance, is that, although much of the original score is omitted, much beautiful music is also included which is cut in every other available recorded performance of the opera.  The first duet, between the characters Ripley and Ginny (Ruthwen and Janthe in the original), is nearly complete, whereas it is shortened in most other performances.  The duet between Alex and Miranda (Aubrey and Malwina in the original) is presented in its entirety, including an exceptionally beautiful section omitted in every other recorded performance.  In the finale to Act I (beginning with the words ""Where is Davenant?"" in this performance), although much that is usually included on other recordings is omitted here, there is also much included in this performance which is never presented in other recordings.
While the updated story and campy satire are enjoyable in themselves, the beautiful music should not be neglected.",1346716800,,1259,5.348484848484849
7834419,5,6303002021,"This BBC film was my introduction to that pre-Wagnerian influence and undersung pioneer of Romantic opera, Heinrich Marschner. As redrawn by the librettists, this incarnation of the opera is a wittily caustic comment on the excess of the 80s. Imagine American Psycho stretched tautly over the framework of an old opera. It could have fallen flat, but I think it is accurate to say the concept works precisely because it is so extreme. It may not be Goth enough for a lot of the viewers who would naturally be attracted to the material. --Too much glamour, too much sparkling broad daylight. The box actually describes it as Dynasty meets Dracula, or some other oversimplification that might make you wonder if you made a mistake in taking a chance with it. Don't doubt, though. It boils down to an old story: a battle of wits between a suave predator and a sophisticated complacent society unprepared to confront and little able to recognize a primal source of evil when it erupts in their midst.",1040515200,,996,4.796511627906977
