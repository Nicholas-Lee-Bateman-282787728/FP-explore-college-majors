He gave a very convincing performance as Gary Powers.  We are so glad to have this  addition to our collection.",1344816000,,241,4.534883720930233
8016938,5,B0001WOIQE,"Lee Majors starred in the TV series, ""The Six Million Dollar Man.""  He also is the star of this movie about the CIA's U-2 spy plane which was shot down over the Soviet Union May 1 1960.  The plot is actually pretty faithful to what actually happened.  Its not a shoot-em-up but mostly about the human side of a man and his family caught up in The Cold War.  Too bad I could never find a DVD of it, but fortunately have an antique VHS player still around.  If you can play VHS tapes, I think you will enjoy it.",1316044800,,509,4.05
