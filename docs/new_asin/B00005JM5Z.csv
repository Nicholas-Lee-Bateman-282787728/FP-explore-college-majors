1480001,5,B00005JM5Z,"Myself, I was born after the series ended, but I fell in love with this series back in the mid 70's (when it aired on a local station on weekends) and I would simply LOVE to have the entire series (as well as the movies, including the Return sequel) on DVD.  I currently have over 80 of the eps and all of the movies (taped off cable back in the mid to late 1980's) but the tapes are starting to wear out with age.  This series, in my opinion, is timeless in the fact that the storylines were (although at times rather far-fetched) really good, as well as the casting of the series.  Both stars, Robert Vaughn and David McCallum are enormously talented and this series is what really put both of them on the map (and in many hearts as well.)  Add a list  of guest stars, many whom have been seen in film as well as stage and screen throughout the ages (such as Victor Borga, Jack Palance, and Vincent Price among many others) and you've got some magic that may never come again.",1090800000,19,978,4.236559139784946
1480002,5,B00005JM5Z,"OMG, WHERE is the DVD issuance of this GREAT Spy series from 1964-68? Come on, guys, this addictive program was the most popular TV series THROUGHOUT THE WORLD in the mid-60's, and even today has a huge cult following, loyal fan club base, and show memorabilia collector interest.
This is not just a nostalgic series for the `baby boomers.' It is timeless for adults and kids alike. MFU sports thrilling around-the-world spy plots, tongue-in-cheek humor and an almost unlimited list of famous guest stars. As must also be noted, its second (and subsequent) seasons, filmed on the now defunct but expensive and gorgeous Kodachrome film, make this series an absolute delight for the eye. Color tints and saturations you do not see on programs filmed later into the 70's!
The writers, producers and directors of the series were certainly some of the most talented and innovative of the period. The show has amazingly well written plots (especially the B&W first season) and in fact even spawned many  `new' photography techniques in its time. These are noted as creative applications utilizing the then-new shoulder-hefted `portable' film cameras. This program was one of the first such uses of these cameras.
Starring Robert Vaughn as secret agent Napoleon Solo, David McCallum as partner Illya Kuryakin, and Leo G. Carroll as U.N.C.L.E. Director Alexander Waverly, this series brought together three very talented actors to create a well-blended mix of character personalities. Week after week they would save the world, usually from the sinister menace of the evil arch enemy organization THRUSH.
The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is grand action adventure.
Granted, the series did begin to falter (just a bit) in its final 1967-68 season, but it was still fun to watch and certainly remained at the top of the `quality' shows of the period.
A 1966-67 cross over spin off, the often times ridiculous Girl From U.N.C.L.E., was also quite popular. The GFU starred Stefanie Powers as agent April Dancer and Noel Harrison as agent Mark Slate. Again, Leo G. Carroll starred as the head of the U.N.C.L.E.
Work on these two series' was quite an accomplishment for the renowned Mr. Carroll, considering that he was not in the best of health at this time in his life. Shows were occasionally and graciously shot around his particular needs, but the producers weren't bothered; they were well aware of their good fortune to have such a respected actor.
In light of many `garbage' shows being presently marketed on DVD, it is necessary to state that the fantastic Man From U.N.C.L.E. series needs to be given its long overdue consideration for DVD release.
And make certain to keep intact the closing credits, sporting the famous ""We wish to thank the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement, without whose assistance this program would not be possible.""
Great stuff . . . right to the end!",1089936000,28,2876,5.004175365344468
1480003,4,B00005JM5Z,"UNCLE is still my favorite show, even if it is dated (and even though I can now see how they re-used that red brick mansion over and over in many episodes).  Recently, Film Score Monthly magazine has released two double-CD sets of original UNCLE music, and I've been reimagining the shows in my head as I listen to great, catchy music.  I've waited since 1965 for real, original UNCLE music, as heard on the show.  Yippee!

Why this show is not on DVD perplexes me.  When it was released on tape, they didn't pick the best episodes, but the ones with the biggest guest stars.  Bad move, but better than nothing.

For a 1960s show that's not in reruns, it still isn't forgotten.  I recently heard Elvis Costello on a talk show describing a recording studio that was unexpectedly located in an old building.  He said, ""It was like 'The Man From UNCLE'"".  I could hardly believe my ears!  See, people still talk about it.  Please release it while we're still around to buy it.

(The part below was added in 2008).

After years of waiting, UNCLE is finally on DVD.  I knew it would be, because I had just finished taping all the episodes from the American Life cable channel.  But as good as they looked on cable, they still played a bit faster and looked choppy when the camera moved from side to side.  I suspect they removed some frames to speed it up.

I haven't noticed that with the DVDs.  I bought my set from Time-Life because I just had to have it.  Had I waited, I'd have saved some money, but after forty years, I wanted to make sure I got it.

The quality is excellent, and the interviews are nice to see.  But what David McCallum and Robert Vaughn probably wanted to say was that the show was mostly a job for them, and they don't see it or remember it as young fans would.  It sounds like they had fun doing it, but everlasting fame doesn't pay the bills.  Plus, they saw the props up close and had no illusions about them, unlike us 11-year-old fanboys.

One of my favorite parts of the series is the music.  The original soundtrack is available on several CDs, which I also snapped up.  I'm sure that part of the success of the show is the music.  And how odd was it to have the theme rearranged each season?  My favorite is season 2, partly because that's when I became a fan, but mostly because of the bass line in it.

Another item worth mentioning is the quality of the guest stars.  And I don't mean just the big names (though I love Vincent Price's episode).  The acting quality of the ""ordinary"" guest stars is very good.  I can't recall names, but they went a long way toward making the viewer believe that the show really visited other countries.  Sure it was fake, but the foreign actors did give us a chance to see and learn something about other cultures.

And last but not least, I want to thank the late Leo G. Carroll for being in the show.  Actually, it was by accident, because the network wanted the producers to get rid of the K-guy (Kuryakin), but they axed Will Kuluva by mistake.  One of the best mistakes ever made, I'd say.

Forgive me for using the word ""gravitas"", but that's what Mr. Waverly brought to the show.  In those days, there were a lot of older people in charge of things, unlike today, but his character was completely believeable and likeable to my young (and now older) eyes.  He had that ""voice of God"" quality (there's a character term for it - omniscient perspective?) where everything he said seemed true and right.  Mr. Spock had that in Star Trek, and Dumbledore has that in the Harry Potter series.

Leo was not blessed with good looks, but he was the linchpin that the entire show revolved around.  Sometimes I wonder if the show would have done as well with another actor in his role.  We'll never know.  But a good British accent is hard to beat.  His casual line, ""Oh don't touch that Victor, you'll blow us up,"" is still one of my favorites.

So you take good actors with chemistry, give them good writing (despite a few stinkers like that godawful gorilla episode), add in great music and excellent photography, top it off with great gadgets, and you've got a classic TV series.

Side note:  Today we have doors that open automatically and pocket communicators that can dial the world.  But where are the cars with the gull-wing doors?!  (I got to see the real UNCLE car at a car show, which was one of the thrills of my childhood.)  And I mean *affordable* gull-wings.  Maybe some young UNCLE fan will make this come true someday.",1088640000,19,4496,4.419512195121952
1480004,4,B00005JM5Z,"Man From Uncle was and is one of my favorite shows. From what I understand the UK. has had this series and the spin off movies on dvd for years, why not here.  If they release the series show by show, well, that is the way I will have to buy them.  I would however prefer season sets, which I think is much better than watching and waiting for the next release.  I have waited a long time and I guess whichever way it is produced will be the way I build my collection.  Gave a 4 star vote only because while I loved the show, I do not know good the quality of the dvd will be.",1085356800,6,576,3.8559322033898304
1480005,5,B00005JM5Z,"In its heyday U.N.C.L.E. was bigger than Star Trek, but misplaced concerns about violence kept the series from being rerun in the 70's. It was Trek reruns in the 70's that cemented its legend, while U.N.C.L.E.'s luster dulled.

It was a shame.
The Man From U.N.C.L.E. was one of the finest television programs ever. It featured cool heroes, fantastic plots, witty dialogue, and a memorable theme song. U.N.C.L.E. was one the truest examples of escapist fun. The fact that lesser shows have been released on DVD, while U.N.C.L.E. languishes, is amazing.
Release each season of this show on DVD. I wouldn't care if it was bare bones with no extras.  We fans want to own this program to enjoy over and over again. C'mon already!!!!!",1085011200,15,729,4.824
1480006,5,B00005JM5Z,"The Man from UNCLE was the first and at times the best secret agent TV show on during the sixties. Cashing in on the James Bond craze of the mid sixties it went from cult show to top of the ratings in 1965 to losing it's focus on what made the show great
and eventual cancellation in January 1968. If you weren't around during this time believe me this show was much more popular than Star Trek. If this show had continued in reruns on syndication and promoted the way Paramount promoted Star Trek in the last 35 years we would be talking about UNCLE the Next Generation and UNCLE the Motion Picture. The only reason I can think of why all of the episodes (over 100) are not on DVD along with the inferior spinoff Girl from UNCLE is the poor management  history of MGM who own the rights. If they are reading this why don't you put these out as soon as possible and generate yourself some cash revenues. You might want to tie-in David McCallum now on CBS's Navy NCIS with the promotion. Oh by the way Star Trek fans I wasn't putting it down I was just stating the facts and what can happen when something fans care about is promoted (Star Trek) or ignored (UNCLE).
 I am updating my review from early 2004. At the time, I believed that MGM had the legal rights to ""The Man from UNCLE"" but learned that was no longer the case. That is not surprising with the long history of bad business practises MGM has had over the last thirty years. Norman Felton the producer of the show believed that he held those rights and hired Ember Entertainment to represent him. Plans had been made to release the first season set of DVD`s at the end of July 2006. When that was announced Warner Home Entertainment jumped in and stopped the release claiming they own the rights since they had acquired MGM .  So now it is summertime 2006, we are back at square one, and Warners has no intention to release the DVD's in the near future. The only suggestion I can make is a write-in campaign to Warner Home Entertainment telling them that you want ""The Man from Uncle "" on DVD",1077926400,249,2054,4.32987012987013

1480518,4,B00005JM5Z,"In Hollywood, where anything successful is copied to the nth degree, the success of ""Dr. No"" led to the ""spy era"" on American television. ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" was a direct result, even to the extent of Ian Fleming providing the name of the ""Man"", Napoleon Solo. Although the program started slow, the fault of a bad time slot, when it was moved it gained viewers rapidly, and became one of the top TV programs of the 1960s. It had its share of TV ""firsts"", including the rapid pan between scenes and the use of camera angles more frequently used for the wide, not TV, screen. Like most shows, it brought in guest stars, and actually had the first pairing of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, playing characters on opposite sides of the law. Barbara Felton, future ""Agent 99"", got her undercover start in U.N.C.L.E. headquarters.
  It also was a product of its time. The use of stock footage led to incongruities, like an airplane on the ground not being the same one in the air. Computers had a lot of flashing lights, communicators had to be assembled, you never found out why  Channel D"" was sometimes opened but not always, nor why guests to the NY headquarters to travel through secret passages when the arch enemy ""Thrush"" knew about the del Florias tailor shop agent entrance. Sometimes the agents were crack shots and sometimes they couldn't hit the side of a barn. They never seemed to learn not to turn their back to a door. By the last season, you would almost be waiting for the Batman like ""POW!"" and ""WOMP!"" graphics during the fight scenes. There were cliff-hanger moments but never a drop of blood.
  None of that mattered at the time. The show was something new and fun. It eventually slotted in style between the outright spoof, Get Smart and the serious ""I Spy"". It had a spinoff, ""The Girl from U.N.C.L.E."" with the character April Dancer, introduced by a different actress in an early ""Man...""  episode. The problem I found,  is, it is hard to take in a 93+ hour marathon, so you have to ask ""Do I want it all or will I be happy with only some episodes?.  If you were there in the beginning this will be a nostalgic trip. If you were born after the demise of the rotary phone you may wonder what it is all about  It did not hold up as well as I expected, but I do not think many ""formula"" shows have. We have come to expect  more complicated, and even multiple, plot  lines in an hour program, and I now look at it as a much older person and with knowledge of  the improved production technology, complex story lines,  and attention to  details not commonly used a half century ago, which I can agree is not a fair way to look at it.
 The packaging is unique, but does not store easily, and the bonus backstories and notes are excellent.

To this original, it's fun and many episodes are very very good.  Seeing guest stars that later went on to become major actors adds to the enjoyment.  Be ready for some serious doses of 1970's music, dialog, and satire.  Amazingly, the sexisim and sexual inuendo that they got away with back then is amazing.  Some of the stuff they say would never get on tv today.  The political and social uproar would keep the news channels fueled for weeks.

1480773,5,B00005JM5Z,"Top security clearance from U.N.C.L.E. headquarters has been obtained for disclosure of the following information (you can't be too careful with all the THRUSH spies lurking on the internet).

This is the best DVD boxed set I've seen. The packaging alone is quite attractive, looking like an ""eyes only"" attache case containing secret dossiers-- one for each of U.N.C.L.E.'s four seasons-- as well as a ""hidden"" compartment with extra bonus features (as though all the cast and crew interviews, retrospective documentaries and archival material included in the main set aren't comprehensive enough--in all, we're treated to 10+ hours of specially de-classified extra goodies!).

I've been a fan since the first season and when this set was released, I only had poor VHS recordings of several episodes. I was delighted not only for the chance to obtain the complete series, but also by the treasure trove of extras. You could not ask for more in a boxed set-- unless you are a Blu-Ray fanatic, in which case you may want to wait for its possible re-release in that format.

The adventures of Solo, Illya and Mr. Waverly  had been off the air for many years in my area. Recently, the oldies network METV added them to their Sunday night schedule. If your channel line-up includes METV, you may now view this set as an unnecessary purchase, but bear in mind that the episodes shown on TV are trimmed to make room for more commercials than were shown during the program's original run on NBC. With this set, you'll see the complete, uncut U.N.C.L.E, uninterrupted by commercial intrusions.

I won't bore you by repeating details that were well covered in other reviews. (De)briefly, if you are a true U.N.C.L.E. fan, you need the wealth of intelligence contained herein. Open channel DVD, please!.",1412121600,5,1793,4.963333333333333

I haven't yet watched all the episodes, though I've sampled some on various discs from all four seasons. So far, so good: no problems with the discs' manufacture. The image and sound quality are fine given the elements' vintage (1964-68). Each disc has its own receptacle, which minimizes the prospect of damage. The entire set is beautifully produced: each season's set is slip-covered; the ""valise"" holding everything is sturdy enough. The extras are beyond abundant, examining practically every facet of the series behind the scenes (including multiple interviews with Robert Vaughn and David McCallum; the latter's silent home movies; an hour+ interview with the exuberant George Mehr, one of the series' longest-lasting producers; and a neat analysis of the show's composers by ace musicologist Jon Burlingame). Given the production values, A-list actors, and (especially in the first two seasons) the quality of the scripts, ""U.N.C.L.E."" holds up remarkably well fifty years later, far beyond its nostalgia value.

The books were different than the show but when I finally sat down and watched the series when it was sydicated I was well entertained and watched whenever it was available.
This set is the complete tv series and it is excellent. Those of us who grew up in that era will get some great nostalgia moments from watching the show.
The transfers are good and the series has held up well for a show that was very entreched inthe values and styles of the day.

Patterned after James Bond, our heros battled  both THRUSH and non-THRUSH villians with sophisticated weapons and sharp intellects. The plots were interesting and the villians were three dimensional characters who had intelligence and charm to go with their evil nature.

Along the lines of Perry Mason and the Twilight Zone, special guest stars were used extensively. To see all these actors before they were famous added to the show's charm. This DVD set is a lot of fun for those of us who appreciate seeing good triumph over evil. I encourage the post Baby Boom generation to take a good look at this set.",1362614400,,705,4.866666666666666
1481259,2,B00005JM5Z,"Back as a fourth grader The Man from U.N.C.L.E. was my favorite television program of all time.  If you look at my class picture for that year I'm wearing my MFU badge on my shirt!  Fast forward to today and I've been watching the box set of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. recently with my wife who never saw the series.  Like many shows from the 60's, 70's and 80's, not all hold up over time.  MFU started out strong, decent plots, interesting character development of Robert Vaughn as Napoleon Solo and the more entertaining evolving role of David McCallum as Ilya Kuryakin.  Season 2 continued to do well and was now filmed in color.  As previous reviewers have noted, it is with Season 3 that the wheels fall off the wagon.  Plots become increasingly more ludicrous and the ""shark is officially jumped"" at Episode 14, ""The My Friend the Gorilla Affair""; the sight of Napoleon doing the Watusi in a tree house with a female Tarzan and a guy in a bad ape suit is just too much.  The unfortunate decision to adopt zany background music similar to the campy ""Batman"" TV show of the same era makes viewing worse.  Thankfully no one thought to dub in ""POW"", ""BIFF"", ""BAM"" graphics during the fight scenes like the Caped Crusader's show.  It gets even worse; in the ""Hot Number Affair"", Sonny and Cher are the guest stars.  You'll wonder how these two ever got their own prime-time program; they are so wooden and lacking in charisma.  Once again, a mind numbing soundtrack featuring a mix of ""I Got You Babe"" and some horrible kazoo music will have you grabbing the remote for relief.  Finally, I wonder about the ubiquitous communicator pens.  In the first season the civilians were surprised and amazed by these remarkable devices (no cell phones in the 60's).  In later seasons when their pens start chirping and they begin spouting ""Open Channel D"" into them nobody gives them a second look- as if talking to your pen was common practice.  I truly wanted to relive some fond memories growing up with this box set but the shows did not live up to reality.  If you were a big fan, skip watching these old episodes and risk tarnishing what you remember.",1359158400,8,2146,4.575916230366492

We had a B&W Curtiss Mathes piece of junk that would stabilized the horizontal hold for more than a couple of months at a time then dad had to replace the horizontal hold tube.

The digital remastering was very good though some of the darker scenes were a little muddied. However, it had to be superior to anything that anyone with a top-of-the-line color set in 1965 could have appreciated on their 25 inch, curved cathode-ray tube.",1355616000,,671,4.368

It is a one sided relationship that has lasted over forty years! I still adore him, and today he is Ducky at NCIS! The product does not disappoint. The packaging is great. A little silver box designed to look like a brief case full of DVD's. There are a couple of DVD's with extras that I had never seen before. David shows some personal film that he shot whilst on the U.N.C.L.E set. It is the only film that exist that gives an insight behind the scenes of the series. There are interviews with both David and Robert Vaughn. David is as honest as usual about his life back then and Robert gives some insight into their relationship too. The DVD's are well packaged with booklets that give information about the show and the content of the DVD's. The quality of the film is very high. The first season is shot in black and white that gives the show a serious side to it. The second series on is in beautiful colour. David's blue eyes are well worth the transformation from black and white to colour! This was an early Christmas present from my family to me and I can honestly say it is the best present that I have received in a long time. It is brilliant.",1354838400,,1310,4.265060240963855

It was one of my favorite TV shows at the time and I'm pretty sure I watched all 105 episodes. Well it's now 45 years later and it's like seeing them again for the very 1st time! This complete box set is put together well and the DVDs play extremely well. Whomever was in charge of remastering these great shows really knew what they were doing. If you were a Man From Uncle (United Network Command for Law and Enforcement) fan back in the 1960s I'm fairly certain you will enjoy this box set. Robert Vaughn(Napoleon Solo)and David McCallum(Illya kuryakin)had great chemistry along with thier boss Alexander Waverly played by the late Leo G. Carroll. This show was made a very long time ago during the height of the cold war era along with the some of the earlier James Bond movies and it's always fun traveling back in time to my younger years via this fantastic box set.

1481392,5,B00005JM5Z,"The complete set is just wonderful; and it comes in a great silver briefcase. When you lift the lid there is a great photo of Robert & David.
In my case I had initially been receiving the series, one DVD at a time from Time- Life but for some reason they don't supply Seasons 3 & 4 (only the first two) in my country (Australia). Despite calling Time-Life Australia and tryng to get a ""work around"" which never happened as they just kept saying ""we only supply Seasons 1 & 2 to your country"" and nowhere could I see this on their website (it must be in microscopic fine print) I ended having to get this set which I now wished I had done the first time !
I got the set from Amazon (I refused to get from Time-Life)and was genuinely pleased. Putting aside my Time-Life issues this is a great set.
There is a fan website called Lisa's Frame Capture Library where amongst some other tv series (Wild Wild West, Blake's 7, UFO) she has ""frame captured"" each U.N.C.L.E. Episode (stills pictures) in a story board manner. It's a great way to get a feel for the episodes before committing to buying this set.

1481524,5,B00005JM5Z,"First and foremost, the video and audio quality are excellent - the remastering is first-rate, obviously taken from the original negative/print.  The package contains every episode, even those that were rarely if ever shown as they were originally broadcast (for example ""The Alexander The Greater Affair"").  Unless you count the theatrical releases (which were essentially re-edited episodes from the series, and are available separately if you are a completist, and the reunion made-for-TV movie from 1982) it's all here.

The packaging is fun, the attache case brings back the flavor of the merchandise which flooded the market when the show was at the peak of its popularity in 1965 - 66.  I would have preferred that the cases which hold the DVD's were sturdier, but unless you're going to be watching these constantly, with careful use they should be ok.

As for the show itself, if you are looking for Jean le Carre or Robert Ludlum, with true-to-life characters, bloody grit and existentialist hopelessness, you're in the wrong place.  The series is a trip back to a time when fast-paced, lightweight fun and escapist fantasy (requiring a healthy ability to suspend disbelief) held a prominent place in the entertainment world.  If you can approach it with that in mind, you won't be disappointed.  You'll see why it was, for a brief time, one of the most popular television shows in America (and the world) and will always hold a fond place in many hearts - including my own.

1481525,1,B00005JM5Z,"I heard so many good things about what a classic series U.N.C.L.E. was that I thought, what the heck, so many other old shows from that area were very enjoyable, I thought this would be a fun watch.  God, was I wrong.  This series is just painful to watch.  A few episodes in season 1 were ok and the rest was filler. Fair enough, so I kept watching and watching to hopefully have one good solid memorable episode..........well as the kids say....EPIC FAIL.  This show was as inane as the 60's Batman, but at least that series had a charm to it.  The second half of season 2 to the series end was the worse tv I ever seen in my life.  Men in gorilla suits, Dr. Strangelove moments, walking cigar store indians (huh?!?), a death machine that spits out less soap suds then when Bobby Brady overdoes it on the soap on the Brady Bunch, etc etc and etc

Every episode follows the same course: Solo and Ilya (if it was not for David M, this show would have been brutal) chase down some THRUSH agents to end some dumb plot of theirs......we could be in the Antarctic, at a bedouin camp, at an indian reservation and somehow against all odds, the baddies fail.  Now, apparently UNCLE has only two ""secret"" agents who really are not that secret at all cause every THRUSH member can identify them at first glance.  These two dudes are stopping their plans all over the globe, yet in every episode, they capture them and instead of killing them, they would tie them up in an unlocked room with a guard who was less competent then Sgt Schultz!!!

Now on to the three main characters:
1.  Waverly: he was like a fatherly sort, he seemed nice and decent, but really did not do much
2.  Ilya: the star of the show, lame Russian accent but I can look past that, I liked the dude
3.  Solo: the dumbest name in TV history.......Napoleon Solo..........huh?.......this dude walks around sissier then Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow character, he is wimpier then DeSean Jackson on a crossing route, he is the most smug man in history..........I assume he had to be some liberal cause no strong man could be this wimpy, so I Wiki him and lo and behold I was right............so at least that makes some sense why his features are very womanly

I just watched Guy Williams Zorro which was very good to excellent and of high quality from start to finish before I watch UNCLE, so I do not like to hear from people who state ""well, you got to remember what time it was done in.""  The show had to suck then and does so now.

For someone who is interested in buying it, I would state that the collection set was very nicely done.

But last night, as I watched another ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" episode, I was inspired to write a positive review, even though the product has been out for several years, because the series--and this DVD set--is just so darned good.

I bought the set from Time/Life AT FULL PRICE the day it came out. I think it was about $250 or so, if memory serves. I couldn't even wait until it showed up on Amazon later. Even though I paid much more than what you can buy the set for today, I still most enthusiastically give it the highest possible rating, regardless of price. Sure, some may quibble about the later seasons, and not everyone is going to like every episode. I'll admit that one or two of them put me to sleep. But ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" fills a very special cultural niche for us children of the '60s, and this comprehensive DVD set captures perfectly the spirit of that time. I almost giggle with enjoyment as I relive my childhood with every episode. And the special features--heck, I'd pay Amazon's price just for the special features alone.

So it should be a no-brainer. If you watched ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" when you were growing up, buy this set. There's no way you'll regret it. Enjoy...",1307491200,3,1299,4.570815450643777

While season 3 suffers from the ""camp"" epidemic brought on by Batman (and is probably responsible for the season being canceled in season 4) it's still enjoyable and I recommend this product. I especially recommend it if you're a child of the '50s and '60s as I am and grew up with Napoleon and Illya.",1289088000,3,673,4.65546218487395
1481918,5,B00005JM5Z,"I loved the Man From U.N.C.L.E. when it was first on.  Then, I went to college somewhere during the run of the show, and lost contact with broadcast TV, what with studies, homework, etc. and was taken aback when I discovered that this wonderful show, that I thought would/could run forever was suddenly...GONE!

In any case, watching now, I get the feeling of what it was once like with TV in the 1960's:  understated and implied sexuality (you can only guess what happens behind the scenes), the cars (land barge-sized), the fashion (for example Napoleon Solo's pant cuffs at the ankles and the very narrow neckties the guys wore--I wish those ties would come back...) AND the guest actors/actresses.  So Cool!  To learn about DiViMa, that iconic model of Vogue Magazine, of whom I had no knowledge (check out Wikipedia on this one).

I'm even studying acting techniques of the different players.

Not only is The Man From U.N.C.L.E entertaining, but it gives one a glimpse into how life was lived not that long ago.

This complete set is highly recommended on all levels.",1287619200,2,1073,4.793478260869565

Oh, the coolness, ah the humor, the technology... and those mid-sixties choreographed hand-to-hand combat scenes... plus the Russian guy helping to save the world every week, many of today's elderly celebrities 40 years younger as guest stars... What's not to like?

The set has all the original 105 (I believe) episodes in their complete, original splendor, beautifully wrapped inside a top secret, possibly bullet-proof attach case with 2 DVD's worth of extras thrown in. To make sure there's no misunderstanding, this is a compilation, not a restoration. The image is not always crystal-clear but I have little doubt that what I see when playing this collection is a much better than viewers back in the mid 60's could possibly experience.

U.N.C.L.E. was WAY before my time so this is a 'new' series to me and, in this day and age where there's not much worth watching on TV I am absolutely enjoying it. Because they don't make'em the way they used to and this is a fact, not opinion. Consider 30-episode seasons where each episode lasts about 52 minutes (compare to today's seasons) and it's clearly A LOT to watch. And I like what I'm seeing because it's cool and it's a sixties show - a world so different and yet so strangely familiar.

I'm not done watching but, without a doubt this was a great buy for me.",1286582400,5,1357,4.737288135593221
1481920,5,B00005JM5Z,"Man from Uncle - I got all 4 seasons discounted off of Aint it Cool coupon.

The first season was the best. Sam Rolfe was the designer of the UNCLE organization, and he stayed on to produce the first year. Although in black and white, the stories are engaging and clever. The trademark wryness of the series was used to best effect here. The series started out with David McCallum having a very small role, but the fans were so enthused, he was promoted to co-star.

The second season is the best remembered, it is the first season of the show in color. The wryness was brought to the fore, but the situations were not so fantastic as to defy imagination. While the writing was not quite as good, it was still solid. Many of the gadgets came into their own this season: the pen communicator, the Thrush rifle, etc. Solo and Kuryakin cemented their light bantering respectful relationship this season.

The third season, due to changing line producers at a rapid rate, went off course from wryness into camp. Drama was diluted by the totally farcical situations. (ie Ilya riding on a bomb containing essence of skunk). The tone of the series was not helped by Nelson Riddle, during a break from Batman, scoring several episodes.

During the hiatus before season 4, creator Norman Felton realized that the show was now absurd and bad camp. He ordered writers for season 4 to lay off the humor, and sadly, while good drama, the S4 episodes do not have the bantering tone that used to lighten the tension from time to time.

There were of course other shows of the era I loved, i.e., Lost in Space, Daniel Boone and, later, Secret Agent Man.

1482221,5,B00005JM5Z,"So have you got a few weeks to spare with nothing to do?  That's what it will take to get through this massive DVD set of one of the 1960's hippest TV shows, The Man From U.N.C.L.E.  This set clocks in at an impressive 41 discs, which include all 105 episodes of the show along with two bonus discs.  In all there are over ten hours of extras.  The whole things comes packed in a neat attach case.

For those of you who are not familiar with the show, and in truth it was before my time as well, UNCLE was a spy show set during the heart of the Cold War and inspired by the success of the James Bond film.  UNCLE stood for the ""United Network Command for Law and Enforcement"", essentially an international law-enforcement agency.  The show starred Robert Vaughn as American Agent Napoleon and David McCallum as Soviet Agent Illya Kuryakin.  The British head of UNCLE was Alexander Waverly played by Leo G. Carroll.

The series premiered in 1964 on NBC and quickly became one of the top shows on TV and made huge stars out of Vaughn and McCallum.  UNCLE was one of the first shows to truly take advantage of mass merchandising and licensing of its name.  By 1965, the toy shelves were littered with model kits, games, die-cast vehicles, figures, and all sorts of other toys.

Uniquely hip was that every episode title ended in the word ""Affair"" such as ""The Arabian Affair"" or ""The Foreign Legion Affair"".  The main nemesis of UNCLE was international criminal and terrorist organization known as THRUSH.  Everything got started with ""The Vulcan Affair"" as Solo is assigned to prevent THRUSH agents from assassinating a new African delegate.  One of the best episodes from season one is ""The Deadly Games Affair"".  Solo and Kuryakin are after a Nazi scientist who has Adolph Hitler in suspended animation and is looking for the correct blood type to revive him.

The first season was filmed in black & white before switching to color for season two.  By today's standards the show looks dated in terms of its gadgets but not in their use.  There was the pocket radios that were disguised as cigarette packs or ink pens that were the forerunners of our modern day cell phones.  And perhaps most fans fondest prop was the UNCLE special gun.  The Gun (one of the most popular of the 1960s toys) was a Walther P38 that could be converted into a rifle.

Also unique about the show was it's pairing of an American and Russian agent together, which was a pretty radical concept during the era.  Afterall, it was only two years after the Cuban Missile Crisis, the incident that nearly sparked a nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.  But fans did not seem to mind.  The two actors enjoyed a wonderful chemistry together and the banter between them is still fresh today.  This is one of those great series that was made for DVD.  Now, why Warner Bros. chose to release the entire series in one set instead of individually is a bit curious.  Afterall, retail price on this bad boy is nearly $200 although considering the enormous amount of content, that is a reasonable price although I still suspect it will put off a lot of buyers who are not already fans.

Extras

When it comes down to it, there are just too many to list.  You not only get extras on the season discs but there are also two bonus discs as well.  I will provide a summary though.

The Bonus Discs come with numerous featurettes including:

Cold War, Hot Spies: U.N.C.L.E. and the Cold War  This 21:00 minute featurette explores the series as it played out against the real Cold War and the politics of the era.

Guns, Gizmos, Gadgets and Garb (19:00) looks at the creation of the shows notable props such as the special gun, pen communicator, and Ilya's many trademark disguises

Behind the Wheel:  U.N.C.L.E.'s Piranha  (17:00) this wonderful featurette looks at the specially manufactured Pirahna car.  It includes an interview with Gene Winfield who designed the car, and with Robert Short who is the current owner of the one-of-a-kind vehicle which is still drivable to this day.

Fandemonium (25:00) is a tribute to the show from its loyal base of fans who are now in the 50s or older.  Many of them produced their own fanzines and organized fan clubs back in the 1960s and now are running websites dedicated to the show.

The bonus disc also feature special ""debriefing"" interviews with cast and crewmembers.  These are brand new interviews with the likes of Vaughn, McCallum, Writer Dean Hargrove, and Directors Richard Donner and Joseph Sargent,

You also get original TV spots advertising the show, clips from Vaughn and McCallum's appearances on various other TV shows.

This is one of those sets that fans will definitely have to have.  If you're a fan of spy shows or 1960s TV, this is a set that is worth the investment.",1255305600,6,4804,4.624113475177305

1482223,5,B00005JM5Z,"This series laid the groundwork for the ""spy craze"" of the mid 1960's. Super cool agents Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin globe-trot in order to put the kibosh on THRUSH, an evil and megalomaniacal organization bent on world domination. American and Russian ideologies clash, but are subsequently sublimated, for the good of the team while on these assignments. (Yes, we all can get along!). Presiding over these ""affairs"" and refereeing between the two protagonists is head of UNCLE Alexander Waverly, played by the great Leo G. Carroll. Famous guest stars like Joan Crawford, Broderick Crawford, Chad Everett and Maurice Evans abound.
  The set itself comes in a terrific attache case that almost makes you want to open channel D yourself. Each of the 4 seasons comes in its own well-protected individual case and there is a truckload of bonus material-enough to satisfy almost any fan. The only qualm here is how difficult the individual DVDs are to remove. More than a few times I thought I was going to break one trying to finagle it.

Yes that is true but It was our show, all of us who grew up in the 60's had the best...Beatles for music, Kennedy for president and The Man from Uncle, Wild Wild West, Mission Impossible and the original Twilight Zone, still the best science fiction/fantasy show ever; just to name a few.

The only reservation that I have with these copies, transferred from the master films, is that the sound is very hissy, and MONO!

It's a classic 1964 cold war spy series that is full of those James Bond era gadgets.

1482368,5,B00005JM5Z,"I highly recommend the ""Man From U.N.C.L.E. - The Complete Series"" for both original and new fans of the program. Some of the things that amaze me about the show are the science fiction props in the show that are reality today. For example, the cigarette case size communicator from the first season that was about the size of a cell phone today. It was shrunk to the size of a pen in later shows. In one show Illya Kuryakin (David McCallum),  the Russian member of the the U.N.C.L.E. team, says that it saves a lot of money on long distance bills.

One show had an umbrella that fired a poisonous dart, an invention actually later used by a Soviet block country. They also had a GPS type tracking device and small self- guided missiles to name a few inventions that are now reality. I should mention that Ian Fleming who created  James Bond contributed to the show's creation. The show also highlighted the ability of Russians and Americans to work together for a common good. Star Trek was later credited with this attribute and the communicator that appeared first on U.N.C.L.E.. In fact, William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, of Star Trek fame, both appeared together in a 1964 episode of U.N.C.L.E., two years before Star Trek debuted.

Now I'm 53 and when Amazon gave me a 58% discount for this set I didn't esitate: I bought it promptly.
This is not my first nostalgia-set: I have aleady bought Perry Mason, Honey West, Get Smart and The fugitive and I found that these old shows have something in common, the facts that it's possible enjoy them even today.
Ok the plot is usually dated and you can see that they didn't spend too much for every episode...but acting is still very good, with people that SPEAK instead of mumbling, actors are always well dressed and last but not the least not ALL people depicted are arrogant selfish bastards...
Technically speaking the product is a 41 dvd set in a cardboard brief case (not too strong), the video quality is very good while I found some imperfection in tha audio, all the episodes are subtitled in english but, strangely, not subtitles in the special features.

After many aborted attempts to release the series on video over the years, Warner home video has finally accomplished the ""impossible"" - a comprehensive DVD box set.

This set not only contains all 105 episodes of the series, but a plethora of special bonus features including:

An hour-long interview with stars Robert Vaughn & David McCallum;
The original pilot to ""SOLO"" - in color! This version features several more bonus scenes with Illya as well as U.N.C.L.E.'s original boss, Mr. Allison, as played by Will Kuluva !
The complete film ""One Spy Too Many""
David McCallum's own home movies from being in the studio and on location !

There are lots of other featurettes, as well as scores of interviews with key producton personnel.

My love of this series aside, I've collected a lot of DVD TV collections, and I'll tell you, this is the best set I've ever seen.

The briefcase for storage is also really cool.

If you're a fan of U.N.C.L.E. , and you don't own this set...you must be working for THRUSH !!!

1482376,1,B00005JM5Z,"I purchased Man from U.N.C.L.E. from Amazon with high expectations based on fond memories of this show from my childhood.  What a disappointment! I thought the show was on par with The Avengers, but it's not even close.

The problem is that the show is just plain dull.  The same scenarios are used in nearly every episode, the dialog is flat, the characters are one dimensional, and all of it is just far too predictable.

As for secret agents, I found it annoying that in nearly every episode the two U.N.C.L.E. secret agents are identified almost immediately, by name, by the bad guys.  I mean come on, if all of the bad guys know who you are, what is the use of being a secret agent?

 I did find it entertaining that Robert Vaughn played the role of the sexy, womanizing, man of the world James Bond type of agent.  Robert Vaughn looks far too much like a middle-aged bank teller to pull off the role.  The fact that his forehead is three times the size of the rest of his face doesn't help him much either.  What really makes it absurd to have Vaughn play that role is that the other actor, David McCallum, who played Voghn's sidekick, would have been excellent in the role of the sexy, womanizing, man of the world James Bond type.

If you want to watch a good spy series from the 1960's, I would recommend The Avengers, Secret Agent Man, I Spy, or the all time classic, Get Smart.  Yeah, it's a comedy, but I would take the cone of silence over the silly radio pens of U.N.C.L.E. any day of the week.

If you have fond memories of this show, but you were a child when you watched it, I would highly recommend you watch a few episodes on the web first, to make sure your expectations are realistic before you pay big $$ for the series.",1239667200,24,1742,4.323076923076923

Some ""whole season boxes"" look nice on the outside, but leave a lot to be desired on the inside! Rest assured, when you pop open this stylish suitcase, you won't find DVD's crammed into little cardboard sleeves (which can cause scratches). Each disk snaps onto it's own plastic ""flip"" page, contained within four seperate FULL season boxes.

As far as content is concerned, the episodes LOOK and sound great. You can say what you want about uneven writing quality between the seasons, but one thing is certain; it's ALWAYS fun to watch Robert Vaughn and David McCallum in the roles that defined thier acting careers. Let's not forget an INCREDIBLE list of guest-stars, including a rather special episode featuring both William Shatner AND Leonard Nimoy... before they went Star Trekking!

Perhaps the only thing I would change about this box set, is the addition of the TV movie ""The Return of the Man From Uncle"". Truly, one of the BEST, and most enjoyable reunion efforts of all time! Even though it's missing from this set, you CAN pick it up elsewhere on Amazon for a good price.

1482586,5,B00005JM5Z,"The Man from U.N.C.L.E. became my favorite tv series the night it premiered on NBC.  It is still my favorite series.  However the show was only truly great during its first (black and white) season and its last half season.  It was inconsistently okay during its 2nd. year and truly abominable during its 3rd. ""camp"" season.  However its 1st and 4th seasons make it number one in my list of favorite shows.  For years I did my best to tape butchered up episodes of the series off TNT and CBN.  I purchased about a dozen episodes on videotape released by MGM/UA during the '90s.  When classic shows started to be released on DVD, I waited patiently for U.N.C.L.E.  My wait was not in vain.
I purchased this set when it was originally released by Time/Life.  Each season is separate with a nice bonus booklet on that particular season.  There are wonderful extras:extended interviews with Vaughn and McCallum, interviews with directors like Richard Donner, featurettes on the guest-stars each season, the U.N.C.L.E. gadgets, the U.N.C.L.E. gun, McCallum home movies, etc.  They are all great.
Obviously the first season of U.N.C.L.E.  was the best.  Terrific episodes include ""The Mad Mad Tea Party Affair,"" (my personal favorite episode,) ""The Double Affair"" with the 2 Solos (made into the U.N.C.L.E. movie ""The Spy With My Face,"" ""The Bow Wow Affair"" (McCallum's 1st starring episode) and the noirish ""Brain Killer Affair"" with guest star Elsa Lanchester as a mad THRUSH scientist.  The color version of the 1st U.N.C.L.E. polot ""Solo"" is also included.
While there were some good episodes the 2nd season like ""The Children's Day Affair"" and ""The Ultimate Computer Affair,"" U.N.C.L.E.'s 2nd season is inferior to the first, starting with the change of the hard-driving Jerry Goldsmith theme to a jazzy version replete with bongo drums.  The descent into camp began with the end of the 2nd season with 2 horrible episodes ""The Round Table Affair"" and ""The Indian Affairs Affair.""
The 3rd season started with the mediocre ""Her Master's Voice Affair.""  Shockingly this was probably the high-point of the season as the show descended into camp Batman-like stupidity with abominations like ""The Apple A Day Affair""""The Hot Number Affair"" (with Sonny and Cher) and the infamous ""My Friend the Gorilla Affair,"" U.N.C.L.E.'s worst episode. It also had to contend with the 1st. and only season of its sister series ""The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.,"" the only show that could've possibly been worse than U.N.C.L.E.'s 3rd season.
After thousands of letters from outraged U.N.C.L.E. fans, the series came down to earth with its 4th great season starting with the grim and serious ""Summit Five Affair""  The 4th season also featured two stupendous 2 parters ""The Prince of Darkness Affair"" and ""Seven Wonders of the World Affair,"" U.N.C.L.E.'s last 2 episodes.  However it was too little too late as the show crashed in the ratings against a rejuvinated ""Gunsmoke"" and ""The Lucy Show"" on CBS and ""The Rat Patrol"" on ABC.  The fact that U.N.C.L.E. was in its 5th timeslot in 3 1/2 years did not help either.  U.N.C.L.E. left the year half-way during its spectacular 4th season replaced in January 1968 by the premiere of ""Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In.""  It still surprises people that this classic series only lasted 3 1/2 years.
If you are a fan of this series, what are you waiting for?  You should have this set already.  The briefcase with the U.N.C.L.E. logo on it is a very nice touch.  The picture and sound quality seem to be very good although I am not an expert in that area.  This set was worth the wait.
By the way, if you love this series like I do, you should avoid the highly-mediocre ""Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E."" released by CBS/Paramount a few weeks ago.  Get the real thing instead.",1238371200,4,3785,4.884194053208137

Even as a kid, I had the artistic discrimination to react in horror to the second season, both for the poor direction and stories, trendy music, and cultural stereotypes. After the first few episodes of season 2, I never watched it again.

Upon viewing this series as an adult, the first season is quite poor, and with the exception of a few episodes, which are somewhat clever and well acted/directed. (""The Never Never Affair"" stands out in this respect.)

However, seasons 2 and 3, of which I have watched only a few episodes, are truly embarrassing. Season 4, which I have made it halfway through, tries to recover season 1 seriousness, but fails due to low production values, very poor cinematography, and uninteresting stories. Even the two main characters have lost their distinguishing personalities.

Don't waste your time or money on this. I now pity the rest of my family who had to indulge my interest in this program the first time around.",1230336000,39,1030,4.711111111111111

I'm almost finished with the 2nd year now, and for the most part the episodes have been a lot better than I expected. There's even some marvelous acting -- catch Maurice Evans in action! -- as well as much better acting than I recalled from Vaughn. Of course David McCallum is the sexiest thing going, then or now, but I was surprised that his mojo-factor is not only what I recalled but moreso. The three main UNCLE men's roles are much more three-dimensional than I recalled. Why, Mr. Waverly cracks a few great jokes here and there. And Napoleon's not ALWAYS interested only in women; he knows his stuff. He's got a brain!

Yes, there are some real dud eps. And some fabulous ones as well. Interesting themes that one wouldn't expect pop up. And the guest stars/background cast--! Everyone who is anyone is on these episodes. Look carefully for James Doohan (Star Trek's Scotty) whom you will not recognize until after the end credits have rolled and you have to go back through to spot him.

The Girl from UNCLE pilot was surprising not only when you think about the ""liberated"" ladies on TV at the time (That Girl, right?) and compare (this comes off in an excellent light), but that the setup for it was so very different a balance than what eventually appeared. (Young woman teamed with older [good heavens, he's over the hill, over 40!] man.) Mr. Roper as Mark Slade? Holy moly: it worked. They decided to go for the teen market instead, I guess, and make Mark into a happenin' Brit dude. (Now I'll have to get the Girl series as well, darn it.

1482594,4,B00005JM5Z,"The Man From Uncle has the distinction of being the Bond rival partially created by Ian Fleming himself when, in 1963, he developed a format for MGM Television called Solo about a pair of American intelligence agents called Napoleon Solo and April Dancer. The series eventually debuted in the year of Fleming's death, 1964, as The Man From Uncle, with Mr Solo (Robert Vaughan) now accompanied by a male partner, Illia Kuryakin (David McCallum) and headed up by Mr. Waverley (Leo G. Carroll). The concept of a mixed male/female crime busting partnership was not really considered acceptable by the American networks at the time - it took a certain John Steed and Mrs. Peel to later change their minds.

The series was an immediate hit and ran the course of the 1960s, not to mention eight movies put together from two part stories and theatrically released outside the US. There was even a one season spin off, The Girl From Uncle, starring Stephanie Powers as April Dancer.

In 1983, the two UNCLE operatives returned under a new boss played by Patrick MacNee in the TV special, The Return of The Man From Uncle, which saw arch enemies THRUSH finally becoming nuclear terrorists (the original script had them develop a world dominating super computer). The show's roots were acknowledged with a guest appearance of George Lazenby as British agent JB complete with tricked up Aston Martin.

1482675,5,B00005JM5Z,"No series ever as effectively self-destructed as ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."", taking the first season's successful 'tongue-in-cheek' approach to the spy genre, and derailing it into comedy (Season 2), low-brow campiness (Season 3), and heavy-handed drama (Season 4). Yet the chemistry of the three leads (Robert Vaughn, David McCallum, and Leo G. Carroll) is so good, and the best episodes, so entertaining, that ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E. - The Complete Series"" deserves a place in your collection.

More than just the 105 episodes are offered; the beautifully-packaged collection (a spy attache case...very 1960s!) includes a terrific array of special features, telling the story of the show, from it's inception (as a homage to the James Bond films), to Ian Fleming's participation (creating the name, 'Napoleon Solo'), to the casting of the leads, and their reactions when the show became a cult phenomena (Vaughn admits his life has never been the same), to the ill-advised decision to so frequently change the approach to the genre. While it's easy to downplay the series against it's more sophisticated successors (""I Spy"", ""Mission Impossible"", etc), without 'U.N.C.L.E.', these later series (and wonderful British imports like ""Danger Man/Secret Agent"" and ""The Avengers""), may never have aired. ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" was groundbreaking, and has earned a well-deserved place in TV history.

So, whether you're a sixties child who grew up loving the show (like me!), or a fan of TV spy shows of any era, ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E. - The Complete Series"" will provide you hours of great fun, with a touch of nostalgia!",1229212800,14,1623,5.2384615384615385
1482676,5,B00005JM5Z,"We acquired this box set of The Man from U. N. C. L. E. [United Network Command for Law and Enforcement] as a gift for Alex Ariano who grew up reading, watching and enjoying Ian Flemings works and some of the best TV series of the 60's.

The period fabulous shows were inspired by the political turmoil of the Cold War, a time when espionage was center stage as the world's great powers confronted each other. The Man from UNCLE was created by Metro-Goldwyn Mayer with the assistance and input of the creator of James Bond, Ian Fleming. This TV series was groundbreaking, sharing a world of secret agents working on behalf of powerful nations in search for defense, control and or information.

Born in Cuba, now I understand why we always heard the United Kingdom, France, Italy and United States had invented razor sharp technology to spy on communists that were attempting to bring capitalism to an end. We heard stories about cigarette packs turned into radio communication devices, pens that would capture and transmit information, etc. These were stories that originated after seeing these shows which were taboo for us. Today we continue to be thrilled by spy stories, just travel to Washington, D.C. where there is a Spy Tour being offered to get to know all the behind the scenes drama that takes place in our Capital.

But The Man From U.N.C.L.E. uncovered how the game was played, the gadgets invented to cover up how spies worked and the competitive world where they evolve, for as one uses a gadget, the enemy counteracts with newer technology in search for advantage.

This ""complete"" series comes in a beautifully designed spy attach case worthy of the most demanding collector. The collection features 105 episodes and we finally enjoyed watching the first three featured in Disc #1.

The main characters are; Napoleon Solo, played by Robert Vaughn, Illya Kuryakin, played by David McCollum and Alexander Waverly, played by Leo G. Carroll. These men work for UNCLE as they search to protect nations from danger, especially from an organization that wants to conquer the world, known as THRUSH or ""Technology Hierarchy for the Removal of Undesirables and the Subjugation of Humanity.""

Those who belong to THRUSH want a world composed of masters and slaves and nations unite to fight against them, forming the operation called UNCLE. The episodes usually feature a citizen or innocent bystander who gets involved in the plot to provide viewers with someone to identify with, as the episode continues to teach how important it is to be alert to all that surrounds us in the protection of freedom and country.

The Vulcan Affair is the first episode of the series. The first season was filmed in black and white and UNCLE headquarters are in New York City. As the episode opens we see a NYC skyline that drastically differs from the views of today. Our imaginations are captured as we accompany spies that are attempting to enter the headquarters of UNCLE through the Del Floria's Tailor Shop. These men are stopped by Napoleon Solo through a sequence of mirror shots that remind us of a Bond film. On this opening episode, Patricia Crawley plays the role of the housewife, mother of two who used to date the bad character and is selected to assist the team to uncover a dangerous plot. Fritz Weaver plays the role of the bad guy. The scenes are superb.

The Iowa Scuba Affair is the title of the second episode, and as it opens we get an overview of what U.N.C.L.E. stands for, an international espionage firm, involved in matters beyond the mundane, a team of men involved in adventures that center around the protection of what is good against the evil designs of nations trying to control the free world. A very young Slim Pickens is featured. Katherine Crawford is selected as the innocent bystander who is dating a THRUSH agent who gets killed within the first few minutes of the show and she helps our heroes uncover a plot that endangers society. As they travel through Iowa and hide in silos we are marveled by the ability to make the implausible seem possible and believable.

And finally, disc one ends with another great plot in the Quadripartite Affair, where we sincerely enjoyed seeing a very young Jill Ireland playing the part of the bystander who works right along side our heroes to solve yet another great puzzle in the adventures of The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

I have waited for YEARS for this DVD set to come out. Frankly, it was worth the wait as the case resembles an attache case and is very smart and sturdy. Luckily I pre-ordered two sets (one as a gift for my sister) because in writing this review noticed that the price has escalated by $30 for each set, which is ridiculous!

Another great feature is that there are English subtitles, but it would have been great if scene features could have been available as well.

Most of the women in this series are depicted as docile, subserviant women whose only thought is to look sexy and great - but then this is played up as part of the whole James Bond genre anyway. However, there are several episodes where the women match the men on an equal footing. I can't believe how far we've come in that I'm one of the owners of an aviation company now - which would virtually have been unheard of in the 1960's.

It was also really great to look at the various vintage aircraft, clothes, cars, and hairstyles on this series. Really a history lesson! Naturally the technology is pretty lame on the series - although it is fun how a package of cigarettes doubles as the ""first cell phone."" LOL

And this series doesn't always pay real attention to detail. LOL In one episode they show a large vault that supposedly contains 55 million dollars and yet only show an amount of money that is possibly $10,000? The rest of the vault is virtually EMPTY. LOL

That said, if you approach this as a look back in the 1960's Cold War era - you will NOT be disappointed in this great nostalgic series!",1227830400,2,1735,4.392523364485982
1482679,3,B00005JM5Z,"I revere all my predecessors who have but nice words for this Series. Yet I must say I am still astonished at the Myth U.N.C.L.E.

First of all, let me say that I only recognize the value of the First, the first quart of the Second, and the final Fourth Season as being well produced and worthwhile to be considered.
And the Fourth Season is just a halved Season, since during filming of it, it was suddenly canceled.

So, in all, we have here one and 3/4, if ever, out of Four Seasons truly worth watching. The rest is plain crap, deja-vu and bad imitations of other series, such as the Whap & Zap Batman series of the '60s.

Perhaps enjoyable by former Beatnicks and Hippies, but certainly not comparable to the values offered by other Series of the time, like ""The Avengers"", ""Danger Man"", and even the Black & White ""The Saint"".

In the end it is just a silly compilation of slapstick comedy, combined with the gadgetry contained in Bond movies.
But the story lines are as primitive as can come and the laughters are forced.

The comparison to Bond movies of the time (the Sean Connery ones), is simply outrageous at best. All they have in common are, as said, the gadgetry, and if ever a common (and always the same) enemy. SMERSH or SPECTRE for 007, and THRUSH for UNCLE.

The comparisons stop here.

The only redeeming factor is the cast (Robert Vaughn, David McCallum, Leo G. Carroll), that does its best to keep it aloof from banality.
In many episodes we have prominent guest players like George Sanders, Herbert Lom, Bradford Dillman, Rip Torn, Jack Palance, Telly Savalas and even Joan Crawford, just to name a few, and yet they all seem totally out of place, knowing what careers they have had or would have.

They all contributed to make an unusually stupid Series shine. This is probably why they were also called in. Being all respected stage actors, besides being famous movie stars, justified the watching of such nonsense.

And indeed, it is just due to their contributions alone, that this set of episodes has survived to this day.

Series such as ""The Prisoner"" might have had a touch of silliness in them, but since they were not set in a true world situation, nor did they ever claim to be, came out far more dignified, although they too, reflected some kitch of the mid/late sixties (see ""Department S"" and ""Jason King"").

""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" is just part of nostalgia, but in my view, and I grew up in those turbulent times as well, it is just that, and not even one of the best representations.

Many have for instance criticized ""Star Trek"" for being ""hammy"", for its acting and scenery, and being an overblown Series. Well, I would like to answer that I could take a Series like this one any day, but not ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."".

Now let us come to the values of the Episodes on DVD. The image quality is fair, but still sports spots and scratches here and there. The sound is very uneven.
From one episode to the other you may have to adjust your volume down or upwards.
Jerry Goldsmith was right to be angry at what they had done to his original theme, especially starting with Season Three.
While Lalo Schifrin's interpretation was still acceptable, by bringing it up-to-date with some slight jazzy interpolation, the Gerald Fried one is just outrageously shrill in tone, and vulgar at best. No true musical taste here.
Nelson Riddle got stuck in his ""Batman""-type style and never seems to be more inventive than that, nor to let lose on the merry-go-round style.
Some other jazzy music seems to be originated in style, like from some annoying ""elevator music"", repeated over and over.

If someone praises such music, he must have been stuck in elevators for far too long, and it would be time to get the poor soul out of it.

I am very sorry to have bought the entire series, since compared to others (like the ones I have mentioned before), but also series like ""Mission: Impossible"", it simply cannot stand a comparison of this kind.

It is just far too uneven and at times, just very childish, to be even considered as a classic series.

My three stars only go to all those who have worked so hard to bring it all together. But then I still must ask: why?

See, some time ago I bought the British-made ""U.N.C.L.E."" movie set, which in my view is still superior than this. Despite that the movie collection missed out on two, if not three of the series, they were ""finished works"" and in a way represented the (questionable) best of the series, and indeed, in that format, they could even be considered that.

Some have complained that in this complete set, you don't get the movies in their theatrical version. But there is nothing new in the movies, that you do not get through the episodes.
Maybe some scenes have been recut and edited in a different order in the movie version, but the material is all there.

It is sad to see some series age in time as this one does.

I also own ""The Complete original Twilight Zone"" which was filmed years before, and it is still an icon in TV-making to this day.
In half-hour episodes you had far more story-telling and acting craft that in these almost one-hour long ""U.N.C.L.E."" incarnations.

The only series that really can compare to this one is, as said, ""Mission: Impossible"", but boy, is ""Mission"" far superior to this.

If you really want memorabilia worth of this name, than stick to ""Mission: Impossible"". Even ""The Avengers"", either the Honor Blackman, or the Diana Rigg versions are a good choice.
But the best ever, remains ""Danger Man"" starring Patrick McGoohan.

Stick to those, and do not waste any hard-earned money on this suitcase.

I am particularly sorry for Robert Vaughn and David McCallum, whose interviews are very informative and show how affectionate they still are to a series that helped their careers lift off considerably.
Particularly to Robert Vaughn who still seems very fond of the series, which is quite understandable...

But alas, ""U.N.C.L.E."" made its time, in fact is stuck in time and will never be more than that.
There are series that have survived the test of time, such as the aforementioned series like ""Star Trek"" (whether or not digitally enhanced), ""The Twilight Zone"", ""I Dream of Jeannie"", ""Mission: Impossible"" and even ""M*A*S*H*"".
Yet some others show their age and are just plain old...
This is one of them.

If you want Bond, then buy Bond, if you want laughter then stick to Sitcoms, but if you want TV-thrills look elsewhere.

This is a series that can only be enjoyed by those who like Cartoon-flat-characters, such as the sixties ""Batman"" and the fifties ""Superman""... For real drama and real good acting, there is no time nor space in ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."".

I am really sorry for this, since the series did start on the right foot, but landed flat-faced, tripping over its own feet.
No wonder then, that executives of the time decided to cut it short.

Only one thing is missing from the Warner case: I feeel that, as fans, we should have received a blank U.N.C.L.E. card.

1482682,5,B00005JM5Z,"No doubt ""The Man from UNCLE"" was a trendsetting series that became a milestone in the spy genre on commercial television.  A Golden Globe award winner in 1965 for ""Best TV Series,"" the show was was clearly one of the most popular spy dramas on television and paved the way for many to follow. Lead characters, Napoleon Solo(Robert Vaughn) and Illya Kuryakin (David McCallum) are the intrepid agents from UNCLE or, better known as the United Network Command for Law Enforcement, whose nemesis is THRUSH, an organization out to thwart UNCLE in its bid for world domination.  The tounge-in-cheek style of the series along with the numerous gadgets (as seen in the Bond films of the day and the highly popular ""Secret Agent"" with Patrick McGoohan) was clearly in step with the times and accounted for the series strong appeal with younger audiences--especially college students.

This set, beautifully packaged in a sturdy cardboard ""briefcase"" with the UNCLE logo and latches to keep it closed tight is a textbook example of superb packaging and marketing. Paramount should have followed Warner Brothers lead from this when they repackaged the High Definition remastered and ""retouched"" (read: new special effects and CGI added!) Star Trek original series this year, but inside this magnificent UNCLE set you will find all four seasons (Season One was in black and white) and the color pilot episode ""Solo.""  Also included is the UNCLE theatrical feature, 'One Spy Too Many."" But there's more for fans to savor....

With over 10 hours of added features, Warner Brothers has included not only nine featurettes that explore the series' impact on TV as well as a focus on the UNCLE phenomenon, but extensive interviews with McCallum and Vaughn and many of Hollywood's A-list at the time who were guest stars on the series.  With design and photo galleries galore, plus the Tom and Jerry cartoon feature, ""The Mouse From HUNGER,"" what more could ""The Man From UNCLE"" fan possibly want?

Overall, the remastered quality of the transfers is excellent for all 105 episodes on 41 DVDs and presented in Standard Format.  Additionally, there are booklets for each of the seasons with details about the episodes, guest stars, shooting schedules, and other useful trivia vintage television fans want. I was fortunate enough to pre-order the set several months ago to take advantage of the special introductory price of $139.99.  All in all, with over 5000 minutes of vintage spy TV in this set, and a very entertaining show to boot, fans will find it worth every penny.",1226102400,9,2555,5.007075471698113
1482683,5,B00005JM5Z,"Excellent quality digital transfers.
Lots of great extras and bonus material.
You'll need a lot of time to watch all these - but it's great being able to buy the whole kit in the cardboard briefcase and not having to wait for each season or half season to come out separately.
It also I find for the price is a very good value - and may perhaps become a collectable.
This set represents what DVD's should be - superb picture quality - and a vast improvement over VHS tapes.
If you enjoyed the show this complete set is a real treat!",1225843200,2,532,4.2772277227722775
1482684,5,B00005JM5Z,"I've been waiting literally decades for a release of the complete series of ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" on video. For many years, the adventures of Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin were difficult to find on syndication, until the Christian Broadcasting Network (of all stations!) brought the series back in the mid-1980's. (I still have old VHS tapes of episodes that I recorded off CBN back then.) Later on, Turner Network Television picked up the show and ran it off and on for years - in fact, they ran all eight of the U.N.C.L.E. movies in an all-day marathon in November 2007 - and about forty of the episodes were released on VHS in the 1990's.  Finally, Time-Life released the entire series in 2007 (the package identical to what you see here) and it was THE event of the decade among U.N.C.L.E. fans.

Basically, what we have here is, in my somewhat prejudiced opinion, one of the best DVD collections I've ever seen.  Let me get my one quibble out of the way first; the briefcase the set comes in is not as sturdy as it could be, in fact, as a lot of people reported last year, it's actually pretty flimsy.  Also, the ""booklets"" the DVD's come in aren't as sturdy as they should be.  Some people recommend that for best protection and long-term storage, you should get a good-quality CD/DVD wallet and put the discs in them.

OK, that's the negative stuff out of the way. Now the positive:

1) EVERY episode of the show is present, digitally remastered from the best available copies.  This was, in fact, a major reason why DVD release was delayed - the producers were trying to track down good-quality copies of many episodes, particularly from the first season.  One especial jewel in this collection is the famous ""lost"" episode, ""The Pieces of Fate Affair"" (written by Harlan Ellison), which was withheld from syndication for many years because of fears of potential legal complications due to all the real-life people lampooned in the script.  The quality of the discs is uniformly good and every episode has been closed-captioned for the hearing-impaired.

2) The extras. All four seasonal collections have extras (the first three seasons have a disc devoted entirely to bonus items), including such goodies as the original ""Solo"" pilot, the feature film ""One Of Our Spies Is Missing"" (collated from the two-parter ""Alexander the Greater Affair"", one of the series' finest episodes), etc. In addition, there are two bonus discs separate from the main packages crammed full of minifeatures on every aspect of the show.

3) The series itself.  ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" justly deserves its reputation as one of the great classic shows of American television.  As with every episodic TV show, the quality of the episodes varies from installment to installment; the first season is almost universally held to be the best one by hardcore fans, but the much-maligned third season actually has, among all the ""Batman""-style silliness, a number of excellent episodes (the aforementioned ""Pieces of Fate Affair"", for example, and also ""The Concrete Overshoes Affair"", another two-part episode converted into a feature movie).  The overarching themes of the show still hold up surprisingly well today, and the interaction among the show's stars - Robert Vaughn, David McCallum and Leo G. Carroll - is a pure joy to watch. (See Vaughn's new autobiography, also available through Amazon, for his own reminiscences of the U.N.C.L.E. days!)

I doubt The Man From Uncle has ever looked so brilliant.  The colors pop, the focus is razor sharp, and I've found no evidence of artifacting or pixilating anywhere in the set.

The theatrical MFU movie included is ""One Spy Too Many"" which was re-editied from the MFU episodes ""The Alexander The Great Affair"" Parts 1&2..
 The theatrical released movies were all slightly editied versions of the two-part episodes that aired on tv or two episodes re-edited together(they also occassionally included more sexully suggestive shots that were too hot for tv).
 Therefore all of the theatrical movies are technically included in ths set--
 The reason I said that this was ALMOST a complete set was they could have included the tv reunion movie The return Of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. ""The 15 Year Later Affair"" .

 To Trap A Spy = Re-edited Pilot- The Vulcan Affair
 The Spy With My Face = The Double affair + The Four Steps Affair
 Spy In The Greeen Hat = Concrete Overcoat Affair Parts 1&2

 The Karate Killers = The Five Daughters Affair
 The Helicopter Spies = Prince Of Darkness Affair

1482842,5,B00005JM5Z,"Received this late last week from Amazon (pre-ordered)...and what a total package of enjoyment!  Well worth the wait...and the $$.  Several posts delineate the contents, etc., so I'll just comment on the extras.  First, both Robert Vaughn and David McCallum are present on several of the extra discs, as is frequent director Richard Donner, and other producers, etc., involved in the Man From U.N.C.L.E.

Their comments are both relevant and interesting; I particularly enjoyed the ""Stars"" summaries at the end of each year, that show the male and female guest stars with brief snippets of their roles; personal favorites:  Barbara Felton (pre-Agent 99!), Caesar Romero, Ricardo Montoban (sp?), Joan Crawford (!!)and Janet Leigh.

On two separate discs, separate from each years collection (separately boxed) there are segments on the music of the series, the memorabilia, the original pilot ""Solo"" in color, public adoration of the stars, the advantages of shooting on the MGM lot, and several of the movie spinoffs.

Enclosed with each season's run package are booklets that discuss several of the problems the series' executives had with MGM and NBC...and the effects of such TV competition as the ""Batman"" series on plots and the tone of each season...which ultimately led to cancellation 3 1/2 years later.  Of course, even with that relatively short run, there are 109 episodes...and each episode, according to Vaughn, was shot in only six days!  They apparently worked much ""harder"" on the sets back in the 60's!

Taken all together, this ""extras"" package appears to have been carefully assembled to truly complement the series, and Robert Vaughn and David McCallum should be proud of the final product.

I don't purchase many TV series in their entirety, but I only wish that those I had (ie.-Xena Warrior Princess, La Femme Nikita, Silk Stalkings, Battlestar Gallactica (still a work in progress)) had the quality and quantity of the extras in this package.

If you were/are a fan of U.N.C.L.E., this is a MUST BUY!",1224806400,5,2024,5.137195121951219
1482843,5,B00005JM5Z,"This was well worth the wait.  Haven't seen the show since it  was cancelled 40 some odd years ago.  Watched the first couple of shows - it still rocks and it's almost like watching it anew.

  The packaging is top notch.  The Amazon price is really cheap - considering what you get.",1224633600,4,283,4.326923076923077
1482844,5,B00005JM5Z,"I've been a die-hard fan of ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" since discovering it on TNT, roughly 15 years ago.  (Since the series itself predates me by about ten years, I can't claim to be an ""original"" fan, whose wait for this set has been, I'm sure, even more exhaustive than mine!  For those of you out there, I salute you for your patience!)  Ever since that time, I've been waiting for the series to become available, in its entirety, in some home video format.  I bought most of the two-episode VHS tapes back in the day, but noticed in recent years that the quality was starting to deteriorate, as is the downfall with the VHS format.

When I discovered, through TVShowsOnDVD.com, that MFU was going to be release in one fell swoop, I jettisoned my tapes on eBay, and dug for more information.  I knew the set was available through TimeLife, but after reading negative reviews about customer service and the quality of the packaging, I held off, also hoping the $250 price tag offered there would diminish with its retail release.

When my set arrived in the mail today, I could hardly wait to crack it open.  The wait had been long enough.  I was pleased to discover that the ""flimsy cardboard packaging"" which one reviewer commented on was nowhere to be found, and had instead been replaced with some sturdier cardboard, certainly worthy of a prominent display place.  I was also concerned when I had read about the disc holders in the ""books"" for each season, and that they broke off easily, causing the discs to slide around inside the case and scratch themselves in the process.  Again, these fears were alleviated after discovering each disc on its own ""page"", secured solidly in place.  It's a little thing, yes, but important to take into consideration, especially for a collector.

That said, the set DOES vary slightly from the photo shown above.  The photo shows two discs per page, when, in actuality, there is only one.  This makes for some rather thick books (the set will look impressive and sizable on any shelf, due to the width of each book.  The fourth season is about half the width, as it contains only six DVDs, as opposed to 11 in the preceding seasons).

I haven't even scratched the surface of this mammoth set yet (I did fire up Season Four's ""The Summit-Five Affair"" today, but that's all the further I've gotten), but for any fan of the series, this is the last stop.  This set contains U.N.C.L.E. in its entirety...and the bonus features look amazing.

It took a long time, but the wait is over...buy it and enjoy!",1224547200,6,2544,4.638392857142857
1482845,5,B00005JM5Z,"I got this set when it was a Time Life exclusive.  Now I wish I had waited as it will be less expensive through Amazon.  But I love seeing these old episodes.

1482943,5,B00005JM5Z,"Fans had been waiting for The Man from U.N.C.L.E. to come to DVD for years, when Time Life finally released a megaset containing all four seasons (105 episodes) and extensive bonus materials, late in 2007.  This boxed set is still currently being sold by Time Life for $249.95.  Last week, Amazon was apparently selling this same `briefcase' set at a presale price of $139.95, which was a fabulous buy.  This week however, the set is now listed as `unavailable' for preorder, and there is no sales price listed.  This is not the first time Amazon has pulled this collection off the shelf.  We will soon see what Amazon's price will be.  Keep your fingers crossed, Best Buy's presale price for the set is $179.99.

Time Life also had exclusive rights to Get Smart, which is only now beginning to be released to the general public.  Fortunately, it appears that the U.N.C.L.E. set will be made available much, much sooner.  Rather than wait, I got my set through a private sale some months ago.  It is a very attractive collection, and while the cardboard briefcase packaging is pretty cool, you may not want to test its durability, as 41 DVD's do weigh quite a bit.  Each season is arranged in a separate binder, that can easily be stored like a normal multi DVD set.  Two bonus discs are in cardboard sleeves.  The photo of the contents of the set is a bit misleading, as some items are shown more than once.

Image and sound quality is very good for a program of this age, and all the episodes are subtitled.  Series creator Norman Felton's original concept was to bring a James Bond like character to American television.  He even consulted with Bond creator Ian Fleming in the development of the series, and it was Fleming that supposedly came up with the name `Napoleon Solo'.  Some of the early episodes featured Solo (Robert Vaughn) operating as a lone agent in the field, however the popularity and charisma of David McCallum as the ultra-cool Russian Illya Kuryakin, led the writers to expand what was intended to be a supporting role.  The special chemistry between the two leads, was one of the key factors in the meteoric rise in popularity of the show.  The dashing and debonair Vaughn, is quite a gifted actor, and Leo G. Carroll as Mr. Waverly, rounds out the U.N.C.L.E. team.  Some fans feel that the first season, which was shot in black and white, was grounded a bit more in reality than the later seasons, but elements of fantasy were very much present from the start.  The program had a ton of fabulous guest stars, and a bevy of beautiful women.

The bonus materials total over four hours, and cover many facets of the U.N.C.L.E. universe, including the gadgets, the music, collectables, and the fabulous women that appeared on the series.  Trailers, promos, interviews, TV clips, and photo galleries are also included.  Those that are hooked on all things U.N.C.L.E. may also want to check out the various soundtracks from the series, as well as John Heitland's informative book, `The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Book: The Behind the Scenes Story of a Television Classic'.

After a long wait, it appears that we are in the home stretch, with the finish line in sight.  Once this megaset actually becomes available to the general public, hopefully at an attractive price, those that have been waiting for so long, can put everything in the past, and we can all just enjoy this classic program.  It took a while, but it will finally be U.N.C.L.E. time!",1218758400,131,3463,4.709302325581396
1482944,5,B00005JM5Z,"The last time I saw The Man From Uncle was on reruns back in the mid-1980s, and the series was as enjoyable then as it had been back in 1965.

Too bad Ian Fleming did not live to produce this show, as the originating idea and storyline came from both his mind and pen.  As Ian Fleming saw it, Solo was to be paired with a female partner, not Ilya, with Ilya being only a minor walk on character. With Ian Fleming no longer in the picture, no pun intended, the popularity of Kuryakin with the viewers caused Solo to eventually be paired with him. Interesting, no.

Finally, October 21, 2008, the duo will be back on TV screens, only this time on our home TVs whenever we wish. The material is finally being reissued.  Now how about reissuing HIGH CHAPARRAL?

I am thrilled to see the first really smart thing that has been done with an older series. I only hope it goes over great and lets Hollywood know this is the way to go in the future. I am so sick of seeing half a year at a time coming out and milking all of us collectors for far more than we need to be milked.

The set of 41 DVDs claims to inclde all telvised episodes from the series, as well as additional features including a briefcase to house the entire collection. I can't say that this is the collection everyone is waiting for..... but it certainy satisfies my needs. Check out the Time/Life site for details.",1209340800,6,403,4.771428571428571
1482948,5,B00005JM5Z,"How come we can get great spy shows from the 60's on DVD, shows like The Avengers, Danger Man, The Prisoner and that brilliant show,Get Smart, just to name a few. So come on and lets get The Man from UNCLE out there too.",1207785600,,220,4.0227272727272725
1482949,5,B00005JM5Z,"When I was a small child I was a big fan of the series. We had only one TV in the house during the time. But when I got the chance to watch the episodes,WOW.The writers did a fantastic job and Ian Fleming helped out as a consultant and I heard wrote some of the episodes. At first it was reported the studio feared he would sue them for copyright infringment since he was James Bond creator. But he like the show and agreed to help out. I will buy the entire series on DVD or if they are shown on TV Land or the other classic channels I will record them. I did not like The Girl from Uncle.",1205884800,,590,3.925
1482950,5,B00005JM5Z,"I give the collection 5 stars.  But, I give Time-Life a huge ""0"".  I pre-ordered on Dec 2, order hit my credit card by Dec 3.  I waited and waited but NOTHING.  Finally after 2 weeks I checked the tracking and it indicated my order was made on Dec 9th, and there was no other information.  Thus began a series of emails and phone calls to customer service, as I wanted this collection by Christmas.  Finally, on the 3rd week, the tracker indicated my order was sitting in a warehouse, waiting for shipment, but didn't move for another week...It took my threat of cancelling the order before I finally received it on Christmas Eve.
Anyway, use the code AFBELLS and you will get 20% off ($50!!!).
Now for the collection.  MGM did an awesome job on this one, the series is beautifully remastered on DVD and packaged along with a ton of extra's, such as interviews with the 2 main actors and some series writers. Only gripe is that for the money and effort to put this series out, they could, and should have included the MFU movies.
The guides were informative and packed with information such as filming and air dates, etc.
Lots of great campy humor and acting, and of course there is the 3rd season silliness, which didn't matter back then to me (except the Sonny and Cher episode, which was painful even back then for me to watch!!).  The 4th season was the return to a more serious, darker format, but of course it was too late and the series was nixed before mid-season.  For perspective, this series started before the Beatles arrived in the U.S., it's first episode was filmed several months before the Bond movies took hold here, and the first episode was delayed in the middle of production for a week because JFK was assassinated!  It really was cutting new territory and almost was overlooked.  You can enjoy this set.  I have seen the ""bootleg"" stuff out there on homemade DVD's, they are trash and not worth the money.",1198454400,12,1928,4.540462427745664

1483071,5,B00005JM5Z,"The first -- and in many opinions -- the best of the tv spy craze of the 1960's following in the wake of James Bond.  Robert Vaughn as Napoleon Solo, suave & debonair; David McCallum as Illya Kuryakin, cool and mysterious.  The two had terrific chemistry.  An amusing incident.  When NBC was shown the pilot they were enthusiastic but had one suggestion to the producers: dump the foreign guy.  Now they thought the NBC execs meant actor Will Kuluva, who played the head of U.N.C.L.E. Mr. Allison. So they replaced him with Leo G. Carroll as Mr. Waverly.  Turns out the execs meant McCallum's Kuryakin character! After it was done NBC contacted them to see if the change had been made and who had been hired as a replacement. When informed about Carroll the reponse was, ""Gee, he's kinda old to be Vaughn's sidekick.""  So it goes.  The series high water mark was the 1st season (helmed by HAVE GUN, WILL TRAVEL creator Sam Rolfe) and to an extent season 2.  Season 3 brought Boris Ingster as producer and the show suddenly went camp as in BATMAN camp.  When Rolfe saw some of the 3rd season episodes he told his wife, ""We won't be getting many more royalty checks from this.""  Adding to the show's dilema was the equally abysmal THE GIRL FROM U.N.C.L.E. with Stephanie Powers as April Dancer and Noel (son of Rex) Harrison as her partner Mark Slade.  The show was the result of a season two episode called ""The Moonglow Affair"" which Mary Ann Mobley as April and Norman Fell (Mr. Roper on THREE'S COMPANY) as Slade. This led to a couple of cross over episodes ( ""The Mother Muffin Affair"" with Solo working with April and Boris Karloff in the lead and ""The Galeta Affair"" -- a weird MY FAIR LADY thing -- with Harrison appearing with McCallum and the lead played by Joan Collins) and a real diluting of U.N.C.L.E.'s appeal.  Anthony Spinner (who produced THE INVADERS for Quinn Martin) was brought onboard to rescue the show.  It was an attempt to return to form but the show became dark and with ""The 7 Wonders of the World Affair"" it came to an end.  Other factors that worked against the show was the fact that every season NBC changed its time slot.  Now this box set brings back all 110 episodes in a nifty package with extras like a set down with Robert Vaughn and David McCallum.  Recollections of the show with director Richard Donner.  Also included, the original pilot SOLO, as well as the movie version of ""The Alexander the Greator Affair"" and loads of other cool items.  I am reminded of something Robert Vaughn said when doing the tv movie THE RETURN OF THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. .  He said the minute he put on the tux it felt like 1966 all over again.  If you're a fan of the show, this collection will make you feel the same.",1197849600,3,2740,4.472837022132797
1483072,5,B00005JM5Z,The entire Man from U.N.C.L.E. series is now out on DVD in one case. But for some reason (?) Amazon is not selling it ! Why not ?,1197763200,2,129,3.642857142857143
1483073,5,B00005JM5Z,"UNCLE fans rejoice! Time/Life has released the complete series on 41 DVDs packed in a nifty attach case! OK, so it's about $250 a set, but hey, we've been waiting forever. Amazon, alas, hadn't got it, but it's on Time/Life's Web site now (as of Christmas 2007). It'll be in stores in the fall of 2008, their site says.

As an enthusiast of the Bond films, I appreciate Ian Fleming's input into the creation of ""The Man from UNCLE."" He created the names Napoleon Solo and April Dancer, as well as the acronym U.N.C.L.E., while having a meal with the series creator at a New York restaurant. The notes were allegedly scribbled on a napkin. (April Dancer, as fans know, became ""The Girl from UNCLE."") Interestingly, Ilya Kuryakin was never meant to be a focal character. That, of course, was before the pilot aired and girls went gaga over David McCallum.

Though the series got increasingly silly as it wore on, I have nothing but fond memories of its stylishness and the brilliance of its color, although sometimes it took a big leap of imagination to believe California locations were elsewhere in the world. I have the 3-DVD UNCLE movie set from England, and watching the car chase at the end of ""The Spy With My Face"" was painful. It was supposed to be taking place in the Swiss Alps, but those scrubby little California pines were evident everywhere!

By the way, the four UNCLE soundtrack compendiums from Film Score Monthly are extremely well done and the liner notes are excellent references.

At last, Channel D is opening here in the U.S. after too many years!",1197417600,7,1568,4.670289855072464

Oh, and those 41 discs were (I'm not sure if TimeLife is still running the special) at 199.95 plus free shipping.  This show is well worth the cost of $4.88 per disc.  A bargain for any real UNCLE fan who has been waiting as many years as I have to get this show on DVD!

But at this point, I'm not going to nitpick the image too much because I'm grateful just to have the series available.  And all four seasons too!  When some series get released on DVD it is done a season at a time, and if sales aren't as good as expected, the subsequent seasons may not make it to DVD.  But here we don't have to worry.  Some may want to wait until Amazon makes it available (late 2008?) or take the plunge and buy it from timelife.com.  I decided I didn't want to wait and I'm glad I didn't.

1483309,4,B00005JM5Z,"This tv series, which ran even longer than Star Trek, 4 years in total, was borne out of the James Bond series of movies, and reflected the Cold-War times when the media was full of the US vs the Russians, as we could easily tell because all the so-called bad guys had a distinctively east european accents - even the deliberately-funny ones.  This show was frequently tongue in cheek, as the UNCLE agents, Solo and Kuryakin, frequently had a quip or two up their sleeves, especially when the situation was it's most dangerous or even potentially deadly.  Oh, yes, you may find this one bit of UNCLE trivia very interesting.  It's about THRUSH.  Just as UNCLE was an acronym, United Network, etc. - so was the adversary organization.  THRUSH stood for:  Technological Hierarchy (for the) Removeal (of) Undersirables (and the) Subjugation (of) Humanity.  Anyone who followed the series closely and with a more critical eye knew that this organization comprised of scientists and business tycoons who were trying their level best to use their wealth and position to ""take over the world"".  We call that megalomania.

Robert Vaughn, David McCallum and the late Leo G. Carroll all played their parts with style, credibility and ease and we were all the more entertained for it.  I really miss that show.",1161907200,30,1299,4.890410958904109

C'mon, Warner Bros. you didn't put it out when you had it, so what's the problem with you now? Is it that you finally realized the fan base is bigger than you imagined? This was a terrific show, especially the first, second and fourth seasons. Someone let the idiots run the third season and nearly ruined it. The best episodes are imaginative, witty, and clever. Vaughn and McCallum made a great team, and had good chemistry. If they can put turkeys like Gilligan's Island on DVD, then why not a really good show?

  For a while it seemed that Producer/Director, Matthew Vaughn would direct a 'MFU' film for Warner Bros.. Vaughn is no longer part of the project. Is there still a deal on with Warner Bros?

  Some of us don't really care whether a new film is made or not, but would be willing to buy a movie theatre ticket if it would insure the transfer and stamping to DVD of the 105 'MFU' episodes.

  Some say this and some say that. The problem is that there is no clear reliable channel of information on what is taking place. The  two 'MFU' projects appear to be crawling, if they're moving forward at all. There is no official 'MFU' web site or even an Ember Entertainment web site. Nothing but the sometimes confusing messages that one might read on the Channel D chat group.

  It's been theorized that Dunlap sees the DVD project as more of a liability/pain in the rump, than a special, long awaited task that should be undertaken with care, and joy.

  Some fear that the film may not even get made and that the whole thing will fall through for another decade. I sure don't want that to happen. I figure somebody with money would do something about that before another 10 years goes by. Maybe a fund would be built and legal proceedings would take place.

 The world sorta needs these DVDs. The episodes are little time machines that can take one back to a special time. The folks who don't or can't appreciate the show for the good thing it was/is have my pity. I feel sure that, in time, they will figure it out. Or not.

  So...here it is 2005...and we're STILL waiting for the DVDs. If I was the rights holder, I'd have those episode masters being cleaned, transferred to digital format and readied for stamping for mass DVD production. It's an expensive task, but it is long overdue! Maybe they should go ahead and go public with stock in the DVD project. Let the baby boomers buy stock and get the thing over and done already.

  Please do spread the word! Let Lindsay Dunlap and her pals know that they've got a hot potato on their hands. They can either get burned by it, or they can go down in history as the folks who set free a great series of adventure tales and made millions just a little bit happier. The DVDs ought to be released worldwide before the series creator, Norman Felton, passes away. He's 92 now.
Free The Man From U.N.C.L.E.!
'MFU' to DVD!

1483779,5,B00005JM5Z,I work handeling dvd and cds at my own store and I have been craving for U.N.C.L.E. I am 24 years of age and live in the city. You tend to dig for culture to get away from the pop norm. I and many of my customers have talk about this and I belive if they can sell Three is Company the would easly sell U.N.C.L.E! and if you disagree with this why did you search for it on Amazon in the first place? :P,1108339200,9,401,3.7294117647058824
1483780,5,B00005JM5Z,"As the maintainer of one of the larger Man From U.N.C.L.E web FAQ's I get frequent emails asking about the possibility of the TV series on DVD. It seems clear that many thousands if not more people want this. Why is it so difficult for the studio that owns the rights (Turner I believe) to see that they will make money - even more so if they do a good job of it rather then a lack lustre transfer such as that made of ""The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E""?

At least in the UK we have had SOME of the films released on DVD in reasonable quality - and this is a start. But really the TV series would be what people would want most in my opinion ... particularly as a box set by season - which as a format has been so successful selling other 60s serials such as ""The Saint"", ""The Avengers"" and so on.

So stop delaying... resolve any contractual disputes and get this stuff out there!",1107993600,7,885,4.109826589595376
1483781,5,B00005JM5Z,"I Would love to see Man from UNCLE come out on DVD! It was one of my favorite shows during the sixties. Sure it was campy, but it was fun, too, and what girl my age didn't have a mad crush on David McCallum! I've always wondered why it was never released on VHS or DVD when less popular shows from that same era have long ago been released on both VHS and DVD.

As for Mr. or Ms. Murphy comment about us only wanting it released because we're ""fearful and obsessed with aging."" Rather a general and bigoted statement, I think. Perhaps I just want to enjoy re-watching what was a really good show or perhaps, I'm tired of the idiot-ass, gross, tacky reality shows currently flooding the air waves. Can you see any of them being released on DVD in ten years time? Oh, and Mr. or Ms. Dale, I have some bad news for you - you're going to get older, too!",1107993600,7,849,4.1454545454545455

The present generation has no use for outdated fad shows like this one. I've seen the show, it's fine, but doesn't stand up against 007 with his long-lasting presence in well-made films or current television viewers who want reality, not silly, action-packed outdated escapist fare like this one ending up becoming, a dead relic.

Back in the 60s the show was a huge hit on the BBC every Thursday night (sandwiched between ""Top of the Pops"" and the main news), and I am certain that DVD releases will be a big seller over here.",1103068800,,364,4.0

1483786,5,B00005JM5Z,"Ted Turner, how about a little extra cash for that gigantic portfolio of yours?  You will most certainly grab a good bundle if you will direct your underlings to go on and do what they should have done ages ago: release The Man From U.N.C.L.E. on DVD!  Realease ALL of it!  I am like every one of the people posting here, a huge fan, and we are just a small sample of the multitudes who are waiting, waiting, and waiting some more for a set that is so long overdue.  And while you're at it, go on and produce some great bonus material to boot, especially interviews and commentary with Robert Vaughn and David McCallum.  Maybe even merchandise some of that very cool U.N.C.L.E. gear.  The fact that the show's in reruns in primetime on Wednesday nights (on GoodLifeTV) should tell you something.  This show was a phenominon in the 60's, spawned a whole genre of action-adventure/spy TV (Wild Wild West and Mission: Impossible are but two) and remains a cult classic to this day.  And with good reason: Vaughn and McCallum were and are the coolest of the cool, and when the writing, production and direction came together, it was awesome.  So c'mon, Ted, and all you folk at Turner Entertainment---get it together and produce something worthy of one of the hottest shows ever to be on television.  And please do it soon!",1102723200,8,1319,4.598290598290598
1483787,5,B00005JM5Z,"Like many baby boomers trying to spend money on sweet images of our past, I find it hard to understand why The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is not yet on DVD. It was clearly one of the best series on TV in the 60s. It's ironic that we can get Ishtar, Xanadu, The Bad News Bears Go To Japan, Caligula, Heaven's Gate and It's Pat (The Movie) on DVD but not a known hit series like U.N.C.L.E. There isn't a lot of investment risk in copying successful footage that sits idly on a dusty shelf somewhere. Hey, knuckleheads, if you're still trying to find the $5K it would take to fire up a DVD burner and print some labels, let's talk!

1483788,5,B00005JM5Z,"This review is about a three disc set released as a collection of MFU MOVIES (special two TV episodes stitched iinto one and sold as MFU movies worlwide in the sixties. It' NOT about the whole Four seasons specially boxed set released later.)

This package peatures five double-episodes of the series which were made into five full lenght movies for non US markets, and are available  here on a three discs DVD set.

They are:

- The Spy with My Face (""The Double Affair).

- One Spy Too Many (""The Alexander The Great Affair"")

- The Karate Killers (""The  Five Daughters Affair"")

- The Helicopter Spies (""The Prince of Darkness Affair"")

- How to Steal the World (which was the series abrupt finale as the ""The Seven Wonders of the World Affair).

The discs come in a splendidly designed box with many production photos, it's really outstanding (not your regular ""keep case"" definitely).

Only problem is, this particular DVD was released in the UK only, so it is REGION 3 (Europe) restricted and won't run on a non-multiregion DVD player. I got this DVD set through Amazon UK, no problem. If you have a multiregion DVD, you are ready. Otherwise, you can either get one which is what I suspect many fans are willing to do (being able to see many other Region 3 releases not available elsewhere), or get ready to wait forever to have The Man Fron U.N.C.L.E. DVD released for your region. Isn't this DVD ""region"" stuff the most idiotic thing they could've come up with?

(This was solved by the later release of the full Series, including the individual, two part episodes that were made into film.)",1094601600,12,1599,4.6512455516014235
