8301247,4,B001F7XI0G,"While I enjoy watching the big film noirs such as Out of the Past or The Asphalt Jungle, I also like watching more obscure films.  Kit Parker Films has dug through the vaults of the Poverty Row studios (most particularly, Lippert Productions) and put out some nice collections of movies appropriately enough called Forgotten Noir.  Collection 4 has nine movies on three DVDs.

Volume 10 is the first in the set, with previous volumes belonging to other Forgotten Noir collections.  Counterspy Meets Scotland Yard is a spy story with a young Amanda Blake (later of Gunsmoke fame) as a secretary hynotized into revealing secret missile information.  This movie is the second Counterspy movie featured in these collections.  Radar Secret Service is a silly crime movie in which radar somehow gives crime fighters near omniscience; this movie would eventually be given the ultimate bad movie honor, being featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000.  Motor Patrol has motorcycle cops taking on a murderous auto theft ring.  This second film also feature Sid Melton, a comic relief character who is in many Lippert films.

Volume 11 has Mr. District Attorney which is something of a screwball comedy about a young prosecutor and a girl reporter taking on mobsters, most notably Peter Lorre.  Western Pacific Agent has a detective working for the Western Pacific trying to track down a drifter who has stolen some payroll cash and killed a couple people.  This one also has Melton.  Highway 13 has a trucker trying to prove his innocence when he's tied to a series of fatal accidents.

Volume 12 contains what I believe is the last of a set of movies featuring Hugh Beaumont as a wisecracking jack-of-all-trades getting tangled up in murders.  Roaring City is obviously a pair of TV episodes tied together (just as the earlier movies were).  The Treasure of Monte Cristo is a modern retelling of The Count of Monte Cristo (another movie with Melton), though only in the basic plot points of an innocent man wrongly jailed and escaping to seek revenge.  Sky Liner is a spys-on-a-plane movie.

No one would mistake these movies for being quality films, but they are all fun diversions, and averaging just over an hour each, they pass the time rather quickly.  I, for one, am looking forward to the next collection.",1288569600,8,2303,4.922279792746114
8301248,5,B001F7XI0G,"Hokey,for the most part (in a good,B-Movie way}yet there are a couple of gems hidden inside. Mickey Knox's intense performance as the amoral,murderous hobo in Western Pacific Agent steals the movie. And,for fans of the great character actors of old,Highway 13 is an especial treat,with real surprises in the casting. No Oscars here,just three discs of good old second feature adventure.",1239408000,7,386,5.344262295081967
8301249,4,B001F7XI0G,"In the days of little or no television, the usual behavior was to go to the movie theater once or twice a week while gaining one's majority of entertainment with what's now called old-time radio (OTR).  Usually, there was a new film each week, so besides the blockbusters, there was a steady stream of films coming from""Hollywood.""

Many of these films were good, but not great.  This is a collection of some of such films.  One of the films, Roaring City, is modeled very closely on the radio show of the time, Pat Novak For Hire, but without Jack Webb's delivery on pulp-fiction similies.  The Treasure of Monte Cristo is a fairly clever story of a man frame d for a murder, following a strange marriage of convenience.  A couple of the films were derived directly from OTR programs, Mr. District Attorney (from the show of the same name) and Counterspy Meets Scotland Yard (from the program known first as Counterspy, then David Harding, Counterspy).  ""Counterspy"" was a sequel for another David Harding film, and the title is a little misleading, since one of the characters is a Scotland Yard agent, a friend of Harding's, who coincidentally is working on the same case as the Counterspies.  Another film, Sky Liner, involvs a killing aboard an airliner, the venerable Constellation, where victim and suspects are conveniently isolated aboveground for a lot of the film.

Many of these films are entertaining, though none is really an A film.  One could do far worse than in this collection.",1231200000,21,1496,4.8313725490196076
8301250,5,B001F7XI0G,"VCI Entertainment and Kit Parker Films presents ""FORGOTTEN NOIR & CRIME COLLECTION 4"" (1949-1951) --- (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Film noir has sources not only in cinema but other artistic mediums as well...the low-key lighting schemes commonly linked with the classic mode are in the tradition of chiaroscuro and tenebrism, techniques using high contrasts of light and dark developed by 15th- and 16th-century painters associated with Mannerism and the Baroque --- film noir's aesthetics are deeply influenced by German Expressionism, a cinematic movement of the 1910s and 1920s closely related to contemporaneous developments in theater, photography, painting, scultpture, and architecture --- opportunities offered by the booming Hollywood film industry and, later, the threat of growing Nazi power led to the emigration of many important film artists working in Germany who had either been directly involved in the Expressionist movement or studied with its practitioners --- Directors such as Fritz Lang, Robert Siodmak, and Michael Curtiz brought dramatic lighting techniques and a psychologically expressive approach to mise-en-scne with them to Hollywood, where they would make some of the most famous of classic noirs. Lang's 1931 masterwork, the German M, is among the first major crime films of the sound era to join a characteristically noirish visual style with a noir-type plot, one in which the protagonist is a criminal (as are his most successful pursuers). M was also the occasion for the first star performance by Peter Lorre, who would go on to act in several formative American noirs of the classic era ... featuring top performances from the '40s and '50s with outstanding drama and screenplays, along with a wonderful cast and supporting actors to bring it all together --- another winner from the vaults of almost forgotten film noir gems
