8103409,5,B000E0ODIQ,"I grew up watching Jerry Lewis movies and the Dean Martin show on TV and they were great. I always liked them. I had seen a few M and L movies but never the TV show. Now I can categorically claim the TV show is the best you will see of these guys apart or together. Martin provides the perfect platform for the young genius Lewis to work. The end scenes with them working with a live band must be how they were live i.e BRILLIANT and unpredictable. Nobody these days has half the all round entertainment skills these guys do. They dance,sing and do great routines all LIVE. As Is said this is the best you will see Dean Martin Jerry Lewis solo or together. Boy I wish there were were people around today as good as these guys.",1292025600,2,726,4.192857142857143
8103410,5,B000E0ODIQ,Martin and Lewis are one of the all time great comedy duos.  Check out Jerry Lewis' imitation of Ed Sullivan.  It was hilarious!  My family and I laughed until we cried.  They really knew what good comedy was in those days.  I highly recommend this dvd for the content as well as the price.,1158624000,5,290,4.296296296296297
