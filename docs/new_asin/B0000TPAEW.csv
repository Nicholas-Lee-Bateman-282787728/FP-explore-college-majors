8002864,5,B0000TPAEW,"This particular film adaptation of Brian Friel's play just could not, in my opinion, be better. A great play. A great film. Great famous actors. Great setting. Great direction. Just great. Like a symphony, you can watch it and appreciate it again and again and still enjoy it.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brian-Friel-s-Philadelphia-Here-I-Come/dp/B0000TPAEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brian Friel's Philadelphia, Here I Come!</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philadelphia-Here-I-Come-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-0-Import-Australia/dp/B000KKMWT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philadelphia, Here I Come [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 0 Import - Australia </a>]<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philadelphia-Here-I-Come-VHS/dp/B0000TPAF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philadelphia Here I Come [VHS</a>]",1337040000,4,902,10.430379746835444
