8168000,4,B000MCI0YE,"This is the movie from long ago.  The quality of the movie is not the best, but it is 30 years old.  Darn good for an old movie.",1374192000,,128,3.5357142857142856
8168001,1,B000MCI0YE,This movie was a waist of time.  I was told that this was a remake of Savage harvest.  LEt me tell you it is not.  Tom Skerritt and michelle phillips were in Savage Harvest about a group of lions terrorizing a village of people in Kenya.  manhunters are loose was a travesty.  I didn't even finish watching it.  Savage harvest and maneaters a loose are two totally different movies.  i highly recommed Savage Harvest if you can find it.  Manhunters are loose I wouldn't waist a dime.,1280707200,3,483,4.471264367816092
8168002,1,B000MCI0YE,"Excellant cast.  Bad viewing quality: faded color, blurry, indistinct images.  Badly needs to be remastered or stop selling it.  Story okay.  Box arrived damaged and this was a replacement for the same thing in a broken box.  Would have liked to know age of product and that it had never been upgraded.",1253318400,,302,4.730769230769231
8168003,4,B000MCI0YE,"This movie was a very good movie, How ever this is not the movie I ordered. I ordered Savage harvest with Tom Skerrit. They both are good movies.",1251676800,,145,4.214285714285714
8168004,1,B000MCI0YE,"wrong title and if it had been the right title, i would have returned it anyway, because of such poor quality.  thank you",1246752000,,121,4.260869565217392
8168005,2,B000MCI0YE,"the movie Maneaters are loose was awful, the resolution of the film was horriable it was so foggey and barely had any color to it i was very dissappointed in the product,.",1208908800,,171,4.375
8168006,1,B000MCI0YE,I was extremely disappointed to discover that the picture quality of this film looked as if a bad copy of the film had been taped onto video and then transferred to DVD. There is no color and the sound is horrible. This DVD should be taken off the market until a better copy comes along.,1191888000,11,287,4.236363636363636
8168007,4,B000MCI0YE,"Not the best of the ""animal attack"" movies but not the worst either.  The 1973 made for TV film ""Maneater"" is a much more tense, thrilling film, similar to ""The Most Dangerous Game.""  ""Maneater"" was never officially released in the U.S. but there are some copies of the foreign release VHS still floating around so try to track one of those down if you can.

The ""Maneaters are Loose"" villians, two Bengal tigers, are too cute to be threatening in my book.  The story is still interesting, just not scary.  It's always good to see Tom Skerritt, he's a pretty good actor and nice eye candy for us ladies.

I think that fans of made for television movies from the 1970s and 1980s should start a campaign to get more of these films released onto DVD.  There are a lot of gems out there still waiting for official releases.",1189468800,5,819,4.456375838926174
8168008,1,B000MCI0YE,"First of all, let me say, this is NOT a review of the movie itself, but of the DVD release. Unless you are a die hard fan and you absolutely and positively HAVE to see this movie, DO NOT buy this DVD. It is a horrible and completely awful bad video transfer, almost to the point of being unwatchable. In most scenes, it's hard to distiguish the actors from one another. It looks like it was copied from a bad SLP video that had already been watched about 1000 times. It's really a shame, as the movie itself is a classic '70's made-for-tv film, with many of the stars of the day (Harry Morgan, Steve Forrest). Hopefully someone will put out a decent and watchable version of this film in the future. Until that day comes, I would steer clear of this release.",1187481600,9,758,4.3076923076923075
