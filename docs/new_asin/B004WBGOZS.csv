8444839,5,B004WBGOZS,"I love this drama it arrived really really fast, like i ordered this on the 12th of october and it arrived on the 15th of the same month i was really happy becaused i didn't have to wait a long time to arrived. This drama has good video(like it doesnt lag), the sound is really great too, and over all decent english subtitles. I know some japanese so the subs don't really bother me; but if the person buying this doesnt know any japanese than i would recomend to learn some before buying this. When i find another drama i like from this seller i will definitly be buying more jdramas from them.",1350345600,,596,4.283185840707965
