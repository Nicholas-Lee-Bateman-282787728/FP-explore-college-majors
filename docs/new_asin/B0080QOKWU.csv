5116609,3,B0080QOKWU,Have only watched some of these. Purchased for Mrs. Brown. It was excellent - wonderful acting on the part of everyone in the cast.,1362873600,3,131,4.5
5116610,5,B0080QOKWU,"What a great price for over 6 hours of really good cinema.
The 4 features are all films that first showed from 1994 to 1999. Each is 99 to 118 minutes and all are in widescreen and color. They are loaded with star performers in stellar accomplishments. It is a satisfying mix of comedy, historical drama, romance, and biography. What more can you say except the price is less than renting. And you will want to watch some of the offerings more than once. They are as good as any of the new cinema creations put out today.

Restoration: Robert Downey Jr, Meg Ryan, Ian MacKellan, Hugh Grant, and more. London 1663 drama of one mans journey through the light and dark of the period times. R rating for sexuality, nudity. One of the best.

An Ideal Husband: A delightful period drama/romance with stellar performances by Minnie Driver & Cate Blanchett. Another of my favorite from this lot.

Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown: Queen Victoria (Judi Dench) gets close and personal during her grief from losing the King with Mr. Brown, a man who cares for her horses and the emotional state of his queen. True love?

Tom & Viv: A very accurate & well done fictional/biographic look a the life of T.S. Eliot (Willem Dafoe), poet with an insane wife.

NO SUBTITLES OR Closed Caption--a shame. No bonus stuff.
Yet highly recommended.
These 4 are also available on an 8 film set at just a slight price difference.

5116611,3,B0080QOKWU,"Of the four movies, Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown was the only one that I enjoyed.  The others were not bery good.  I would have preferred to have closed caption because the dialogue was hard to understand on many occasions.  The service was very good.",1361750400,3,246,4.545454545454546
5116612,4,B0080QOKWU,"Haven't seen all of them yet, but what I have seen is very good. Yes anyone that likes movies. Will like this DVD.",1359504000,,114,4.0
5116633,5,B0080QOKWU,"4 great movies to watch on one DVD.  I enjoyed ""Mrs. Brown"" greatly. It did not fail to entertain me and gave me a better understanding of the love that queen Victoria had for Prince Albert and what a good and true friend John Brown was to her after Prince Albert died.  ""Restoration""  very interesting movie.  I am amazed at the number of actors I recognized in this move and it didn't make a box office smash in the states, wonder if it did over seas?  Good move all the same.  ""Tom & Viv""  another good movie.  I enjoyed learning more about the early years and first marriage of T. S. Eliot.  ""An Ideal Husband"" great movie! I enjoyed this movie the most of them all.  Classic movie of mixed up loves and lives friends and enemies. How true love triumphs and bad people are lonely.  I feel this movie alone is worth getting this DVD for.  Yet again so many actors I recognize in this one too.  For mercy sake get this DVD and start enjoying a trip back in history with all its romantic ideals.",1393372800,,996,4.262032085561497

5116640,5,B0080QOKWU,"This was, without a doubt, one of the best purchases I have ever made;  I throughly enjoyed each movie.  All four had wonderful actors, interesting plots, and were all uniquely British.  They were, however, at times, a bit slow moving, but to me, not a downside at all, compared to all the fast-moving, violent, obscene movies out there.  It is a matter of choice, and I would buy it again in a heatbeat.  Thank you to all the people that make great British movies!",1366761600,,465,4.488095238095238
5116641,4,B0080QOKWU,I really liked 2 and the other 2 were OK. Worth the money. Good for rainy days when you are tired of doing laundry and unloading the dishwasher.,1365120000,,144,4.178571428571429
