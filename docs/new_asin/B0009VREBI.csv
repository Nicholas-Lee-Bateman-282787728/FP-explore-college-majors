8314759,4,B0009VREBI,"I am interested in learning more of the Philippines, Ihope to travel there next year.  This movie was recommended by a filipina woman I work with.

It is a beautiful movie.  The family is very divided and caught up in their own lives.  Greed brings them together.  It is sad to see how families grow apart.  The characters are very personal amd i can say I felt connected.  The ugly and beautiful sides of people are revealed.  Mistakes from the past build drama and I did cry at two scenes.  I was greatly surprised.",1121644800,4,517,4.414893617021277
