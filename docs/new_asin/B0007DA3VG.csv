2211106,5,B0007DA3VG,Delivered perfectly in a beautiful boxed set. I must agree the episodes chosen to show the bond of Xena & Gabrielle would be the ones I would chose.,1483401600,,148,4.321428571428571

2211108,2,B0007DA3VG,"This is not the entire 6 seasons of Xena Warrior Princess, as implied by its placement.  And the  fact that it contains only 6 or 7 disks is blacked out from the photo of the front cover.  Caveat Emptor.",1481155200,,203,4.153846153846154

We were so busy we were not able to watch all the shows, with all four of them going in different directions, but now that things have settled down some, we all sit and watch them in order on weekends.

2211187,5,B0007DA3VG,Epic series brilliant acting by LL and ROC- far more subtle character development than obvious stories-range from goofy to tragic- one of a kind for the Ages,1410393600,,157,4.851851851851852

2211189,5,B0007DA3VG,Great price for the memories,1409529600,,28,4.8
2211190,4,B0007DA3VG,"Overall, I enjoyed the series almost as much as I enjoyed the ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"" bundle, despite the fact that Xena and Gabriele killed far more humans (mortals).

The series stressed the ultimate triumph of good over evil, especially in the case of Xena herself.

What I HATED was the intrusion of liberal politics, specifically the homosexual agenda.  That was featured in the episode ""There She is, Miss Amphipolis"", when a cross-dressing man won a beauty contest.

Then there was the relationship between Xena and Gabriele.  I didn't see it as a homosexual relationship.  However, in articles on 'Wikipedia,' I saw that the homosexual lobby jumped in with both feet, despite the fact that at no time were they portrayed as lovers.

All in all, I recommend it for the overall entertainment value, especially following ""Hercules The Legendary Journeys.""",1409529600,,871,5.178571428571429
2211191,5,B0007DA3VG,"Awesome!!! :) :) :) This bundle comes with a box to contain all the series! So beautiful! Each one of the boxes (and the big box too) are still new and sealed! This is the Deluxe Collector's Edition with a lot of bonus contents and there are 53 Discs in total, divided in this way:

- Season 1: 6 DVD + 1 CD-ROM (7 Discs)
- Season 2: 6 DVD + 1 CD-ROM (7 Discs)
- Season 3: 8 DVD + 1 CD-ROM (9 Discs)

- Season 5: 9 DVD + 1 CD-ROM (10 Discs)
- Season 6: 9 DVD + 1 CD-ROM (10 Discs)

2211204,5,B0007DA3VG,"Great series.  Well written, casted and acted.  A nice, entertaining series that is well crafted and fun to watch unfold.  Probably not for the history buff.",1406073600,,157,4.961538461538462
2211205,4,B0007DA3VG,I love Xena and think the series is fantastic!! The quality of the DVDs just aren't as good as the newer shows. They are not horrible but the picture just isn't that crystal clear we have today. Shows how far we've come with technology.,1405728000,,236,4.386363636363637
2211206,5,B0007DA3VG,"I love this series from beginning to end.  It's not just campy fun but it gives a great look at what every woman who dreams of adventure would love to experience in her dream.  That's enough about the series.  The set of disks is fragile and needs to be kept out of the reach of pets, children, and heat.  Otherwise it can be viewed again and again for years.

2211207,5,B0007DA3VG,for Xena Fans! the best collection! I love XENAAAAAAAA! I Have love and Xena in world! The BEST SERIES! ^^,1401580800,,106,4.35

2211209,2,B0007DA3VG,"I love this show! Beautiful scenery and great, lovable characters. I give FIVE STARS for the show itself but the DVD quality is bad.  I'm only half way through season 2 right now but I felt inclined to leave a comment. The problem is firstly the sound; the music is very loud and totally drowns out the dialogue, I wouldn't mind except there are no captions provided! I am not elderly or hard of hearing but I'm only catching every third word or so. I don't remember this being a problem when it was on TV so it must be the DVD. I am seeing this more and more these days with DVDs but at least all others I've bought have subtitles. I live in an apartment so having the TV turned up real loud is not an option unless I want to upset my neighbors which brings me to another problem. I thought I'd watch them on my desktop so I could use headphones and have it turned up loud. The DVDs would not play at all! I've watched others on it no problem but my computer could not read these! I LOVE the show but the quality is bad and watching them has become a chore as I can hardly hear a word!",1399334400,9,1086,4.051162790697674
2211210,5,B0007DA3VG,"I liked to watch the Xena series when it was on TV. I've always liked shows and movies that are Action Packed and deal with Magic Powers and have great effects in them, and ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" does. All the Actresses and Actors played their parts Very Well and I'm glad I own the Series.",1396051200,,292,4.327272727272727
2211211,3,B0007DA3VG,"I love the collection of six seasons,however, I was shocked and disappointed that closed caption was not  available!  I remember watching the series with captioning so I  assumed the set would definitely have that option.  Seeing as I am hearing impaired, it was important that I had that feature available to me.  I can only visually enjoy the DVDs and miss out on much of the storyline.  My mistake for not  looking into my purchase more carefully.",1394582400,5,450,4.766233766233766
2211222,5,B0007DA3VG,It looks in the pictures that the 6 seasons are seperate but I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived in a box. I loved the series and the thought of a woman kicking butt and my daughters do to. This is a great clean tv series to watch with the family. Wonderful packaging.,1394582400,,275,4.2075471698113205
2211223,5,B0007DA3VG,"I remember watching this series when it was on TV. Never got to see more all of the episodes. When it came on Netflix,I watched all the episodes. All but two were on the list. which is why I bought the complete sries",1394496000,,216,4.046511627906977

2211225,5,B0007DA3VG,Arrived in perfect condition.  The episodes are amazingly redone.  The color and clarity is awesome.  I so enjoy watching all the episodes again.,1393632000,2,145,5.217391304347826
2211226,5,B0007DA3VG,"A lot of TV shows don't age well but ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" absolutely delivers. It's as fresh and as fun as I remembered.  The fights are crazy and everybody is having a good old time.  They don't make TV like this anymore.",1392681600,,226,4.357142857142857
2211227,5,B0007DA3VG,I bought these videos as a gift and they were exactly what was expected.  The package came in free of defects or issues and all videos seem to work just fine.,1391904000,,158,4.096774193548387

2211232,5,B0007DA3VG,Since I last reviewed this item I took the vendors insight and tried the Xena DVD's on a non-BluRay player attached to an old fashioned tube TV. What a difference! Picture was good and quite enjoyable. Sadly my BluRay and flat screen LCD TV magnified imperfections to mimic a bad DVD. Sorry about that folks.,1388966400,,308,4.618181818181818
2211233,5,B0007DA3VG,I really enjoyed Xena on Netflix.  I really like the strong female character and enjoyed the sometimes wacky plots. I decided I wanted a set of these for myself and was lucky enough to find a used set that I could afford.,1387843200,,221,4.261904761904762

2211237,5,B0007DA3VG,"A little embarassed to like the show so much as I am 60, female, but it strikes a chord with me.  I love the writing, the jokes, the scenery, the sets, the costumes, the boldness of the themes (like Altared states challenging the Bible), the actors, of course Lucy and Renee, the music, the romantic scenes...
I like that the cast seems to be enjoying being a part of it all.
It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is mine!!!",1378857600,4,430,4.180722891566265

2211239,5,B0007DA3VG,"The series itself was great - and the commentaries and special features were wonderful.  But I didn't realize until 6 months later that in the Second Season collection, A Day In The Life and the Destiny episodes are supposed to have commentaries (Audio and Video) and do not. Which sucks - I'll have to buy another season 2 collection to get that - otherwise, everything arrived well and the series is terrific of course.",1377043200,3,421,4.6891891891891895

2211260,5,B0007DA3VG,"I'm not going to rundown all the obvious facts and trivia because it's all been done before; I'm just sharing my unique experience and opinion.

I was on deployment in the Navy when I saw one of these episodes for the first time back in 2000 but unfortunately due to deployments and work schedules I never got to see more than a very small handful of these episodes.

I ordered the complete series about four years ago but again due to deployment schedules (merchant marine now) and work schedule like before they basically stayed in the box until recently.

I just finished watching the entire series including Hercules while on deployment in the Mediterranean Sea in and around the Greek islands, mostly Crete (seriously doubt anyone else can make this claim).  I can honestly say that the New Zealand locations these series were filmed at bear little resemblance to ancient or modern Greece.

Both series were absolutely great!  Watched them every day and got absorbed into the characters, so much so that when the end came I could not believe they ended the series like that.  I have no problem with reality but it felt real to me and I'm still very angry with the way Xena was killed/murdered/butchered at the end.

The next time I watch this series I'll have to end it with the next to last episode because this was one of the few TV shows my wife and I both watched together and liked unfortunately we never saw them all together because of our schedules.  She died last year and it's taken me a long time to come to grips with her death and watching Xena's final mortal moments isn't something I care to ever watch again since her character was one my wife and I both enjoyed.

Except for the last episode the rest of the series is five stars.",1360022400,,1751,4.53015873015873

She said on her FB page it was the best gift she's ever had!  That's quite a compliment.  The collection came in a decorative case that contained six cases within it, one for each season... and she found an episode she claims she never saw before.  I think if you have a daughter who needs a strong, positive role model, this might just be the gift for her!  Especially if she liked Xena on TV in the 90s.

And unfortunately, as the Freakin' FCC got more 'concerned' with TV ratings and crap like that, they had to 'dumb it down'. Still a very FUN and ADVENTUROUS series. Expensive, sure. But for so many seasons, this takes at least half-year to a year to get done watching, and the replay value is certainaly there. The same can be said for the ""Hercules the Legendary Journeys"" saga.",1348444800,,508,4.655555555555556

When it got to viewing the second season, the first three discs were unreadable.  I tried playing them in two different DVD players and one blue ray player.  They were unreadable.  Unfortunately, it was after the thirty days, so now I am stuck with something that should have been enjoyable, that now is a great disappointment.  Trying to communicate my dissatisfaction with Amazon for a replacement set was a horrid experience.

Normally Amazon is very good at handling these things. Since it came in a box set they wouldn't replace just season 2. They gave me a partial refund which rebought season 2. Season 5 on every disc had glitches. The discs were without scratches, but had digital issues and freezing problems. I would say I did not get my money's worth and am very unhappy on how Amazon solved the problem. I would never buy a bundle series again knowing that they will not replace the season that is defective.",1331510400,5,665,4.328
2211290,1,B0007DA3VG,"After receiving this set I checked each disk to make sure they were free of scratches, etc.  They looked okay so I put them on the shelf and didn't think anything more about it.  When I got around to watching them I found that there was one disc from season 2 that wouldn't load in any of my DVD players.  Okay, that sucks, but it happens.  Little did I know that I would eventually go through the mind-bending, soul-shattering trauma of trying to watch season 5.  There are three episodes per disc.  On every single disc of season 5 the second episode plays to about the half way point and then freezes.  Well that's okay, Amazon is usually pretty good about fixing these kinds of problems...or maybe not.  When I tried to return the product I was informed that since I didn't immediately start watching all 132 episodes back-to-back I had missed the return window.  So now I have The confidence-inspiring option of either returning the set at my expense for a partial credit or trading it in for a $21.00 credit.  Oh well, that's only $100 difference.

The most beautiful women on tv make frequent appearances on this show AND Hercules. For the female audience there is all the lovey mushy stuff as well as two female heroes. Which brings me to Gabriel, she goes from defensles peasent to being able to whoop whole sale butt half way through the series and you watch her evolve to that.

Yes, there are scenes and episodes that are pretty ridiculous, but I can't help but like this show still.  It is rare to have two characters that are so amazing together, obviously that would be Xena and Gabrielle!  I love the connection that they have.  I wish this show would have lasted a bit longer.  I was not one of those that was disappointed in the show, but I wish they would have done something that could make it so a TV movie or something could be made again.  Oh well.

So I wound-up buying an ADDITIONAL copy of ""A Friend In Need,"" BECAUSE it was not listed in the product description for this boxed-set.  Great, now I have a re-gift that not many of my friends will really want.  And who in the HELL decided to let the nut-bag totally-obsessed CONVENTION FANS decide what goes on a ""best of"" collection?!!?!?  They missed SO MANY IMPORTANT EPISODES, especially the ones that show the late Kevin Tod Smith to his finest, and there were TWO ENTIRELY WASTED DISCS OF CONVENTION CRAP AND THE BLATHERING COMMENTARY OF ***MINOR SUPPORTING PLAYERS*** THAT I COULD *DEFINITELY* HAVE LIVED WITHOUT ---  and yet, not to harp on it, but it IS a rather obvious duty that they SEVERELY NEGLECTED:  not one friggin' MENTION of a tribute to Kev.  NOTHING.  ONE episode where he carried a lot of the work, ""Old Ares Had A Farm,"" but that's IT.  And only Rob Tapert did any ""cast & crew interview"" in regard to that episode, and THAT was SEVERELY LACKING, ROB.

I'm surprised that Lucy Lawless & Renee' O'Connor didn't have more of a say in this hastily-thrown-together package, because Lucy is SEVERELY P.O.'ed throughout the interviews on the first three-four discs and hardly SPEAKS.  Renee' has to DRAG IT OUT OF HER, because Lucy's sitting there, SEETHING about SOMETHING...  gee, could it be 'cause the fanatical ""fans"" DISSED THE HELL OUT OF ONE VERY TALENTED, HARD-WORKING ACTOR when compiling the list of ""Best Of"" episodes, Lucy?  Or because your producer hubby DIDN'T EVEN WANT KEV'S NAME MENTIONED, AND ONLY A *MINOR* ACTRESS, the ""adult"" Eve, MENTIONS HIS NAME IN *ANY* INTERVIEWS?  If Lucy was so pissed, why didn't she CHANGE THAT???  I also blame the OTHER Raimi, not Ted, but the Executive Producer, mister big-shot ""Spiderman"" SAM Raimi.  HE could've done something about this crap before signing-off on the compilation.

Also, to Amazon, the great corporate killer of independent bookstores 'round the world, why don't Y'ALL mention Kev Tod Smith in ANY of the Xena credits, for ANY discs OR on-demand streaming video?  Too depressing to think about the dead guy, too talented and died too young?  Without ""Ares,"" Xena wouldn't have existed, ""Hercules"" or not.  He's as pivotal a part of that series as ""Xena"" or the snippy little ""Gabrielle,"" much less any of the other ""gods"" or regular players.

2211352,5,B0007DA3VG,"My wife and I became Xena fans when this show was on the air. I devoured Greek myths as a kid, my wife doesn't know how to spell myth, so this show appeals to a wide audience. I thank God that the gods were regulars on the show unlike Petersen's Troy which destroyed that movie experience for me. The gods in Xena seemed true to my earlier readings. Xena is not Masterpiece Theatre but its far more watchable than 90% of current TV, the episodes are visually rich and timeless. The show somehow pulls off a rich soup of ingredients from morality play to comedy and slapstick. Xena's stuggle to atone for her villainous past. Testing of Gabrielle's bountiful optimism. Joxer's plain silliness. Almost every device (gods, demons, heroes and villains) that still haunts me from Greek myths and ancient European history is found in one or more episodes. In short, Xena then and now is great entertainment, they just don't make shows like this anymore.

In regards to discs and packaging, I tested every disc soon after arrival and found to each be sound. This was a high speed disc integrity check not by watching, though I have watched about half of the episodes by now.

While her adventures and exploits may range from the exhilarating to the absurd and the acting most of the time way over-the-top somehow, believe it or not, it was always tons of fun and the cast of characters where played to perfection by everyone involved.

Here it is, all six seasons of `Xena: Warrior Princess' just within your reach. Yes you could by a season or two separately but what would be the point? This is an evolving saga that has to be viewed in its entirety to be fully understood and appreciated. The action is fast and furious, the drama dark and foreboding, the comedy slapstick and the cast exceptional. There isn't a household on Olympus that doesn't own the complete set, shouldn't you?

Not only did she love this gift; she has had my other sister & numerous friends see the collection at her house and want to borrow them.  It never ceases to surprise me how many people know about the Xena series - it was/is wonderful and hopefully the DVDs will work forever!",1212624000,4,612,4.1525423728813555
2211365,4,B0007DA3VG,"For those of you who have not seen Xena: Warrior Princess, there's not much I can add to the existing positive reviews.  It's great action, at times heartfelt or hilarious or risque.  Christians might be offended by the not so subtle references to biblical stories (i.e. ""immaculate"" conception of Xena's baby.) But the show doesn't take itself seriously either (look for 2 or 3 times when Xena is whistling her own theme song.)

To the fans looking for the complete collection, grab it while you can!  That is despite the season 1 collection.  It's got poor special features and weak video quality that's very obvious on the HDTV.  I've seen better quality VHS recordings.

Season 2 has the same weak video quality but a few features like occasional commentary and interviews.  During the commentary, Bob Tapert's the serious one and Lucy Lawless is laughing at herself like Mystery Science Theater 3000.  Certainly interesting to hear her without the American accent.  They introduced the concept of Video Commentary, where they show the actors or crew reacting to the episode as they're watching it.  You can't watch that instead of an episode (the video commentary is not on the complete episode) but there is some value added to see their reactions.

Season 3 is when the video quality got much better and the features excellent.  I'm almost through season 5 of 6 and the features pretty much stay consistent from there.

Overall this is well worth it.",1212537600,65,1457,4.893877551020408
2211366,5,B0007DA3VG,"I grew up watching this religiously. I still watch it occasionally when I feel like I need to get away from it all. Yes, it is a bit tacky with silly musicals and sometimes ridiculous story lines, but I absolutely love Xena and Gabrielle.",1208304000,3,238,4.431818181818182
2211367,5,B0007DA3VG,"This series had everything in it: Comedy, drama, inspiration, musicals, etc... I also believe this was a series that helped create certain television shows and movies. Watch (Here She Comes... Miss Amphipolis 1997) and tell me that's not similar to (Miss. Congeniality 2000). Remember that Xena was being played in a different time period (Historical Times) and Miss. Congeniality is being played in the present, yet they are still similar. The show not only had a few good laughs with the help of Joxer (Ted Rami)but also allows viewer the feeling of Catharsis. Seeing Xena battle her past demons and realizing she wouldn't be the hero she is without her past is PRICELESS. Also watching the growth of  Xena (Lucy Lawless) and Gabrielle's (Renee O Conner) friendship is something very special. They become family and travel to the exotic lands of Asia and to the beautiful landscape of Egypt etc...

The DVDS are worth it I own all 6 seasons and the commentaries are GREAT. I especially love watching Hudson Leick's (Callisto)commentary she's intelligent, funny, and beautiful.

P.S. My one note would be buy the director's cut of The Final Episode (A Friend In Need) because it's much better. Plus you get great extras including commentary by Lucy, Renee, and Rob and you also get behind the scene footage including a little B-Day cake for Lucy. The commentary is great I just finished watching it again for my 100th time because I find Lucy and Renee hysterical.

I will always have faith that a Xena Movie will be made, although Gabrielle lost faith in her Hope; I will always have faith that Xena will eventually become a movie; plus I'm only 19 so I still have plenty of years left to wait lol.

Well Thank you Lucy, Renee, Rob, Hudson, Ted, Bruce, Kevin and all the other people that made Xena possible. You filled many homes with joy, laughter, and inspiration; it truly is one of televisions greatest moments!",1200787200,4,1918,4.817629179331307

This was originally a spin-off of the Hercules series, but soon gained a following of its own. Each episode was generally self-contained and often used a myth or mythical character as the backdrop for the episode. Xena was not an Amazon, although Gabrielle became one after she tried to save an Amazon's life. The show was kind of goofy, but was great mind-numbing entertainment.",1168646400,7,538,5.125
2211372,5,B0007DA3VG,"I was a junior in highschool when Xena's final episode aired on television. The show, for a while, ran in syndication, and after a few years hiatus is now back on tv. It was its return to tv that prompted me to buy this set. I had forgotten how much I loved to watch Xena and Gabrielle's adventures. These episodes are great, and I've noticed that some of what we see here is not what aired on tv, guess the FCC had something to say about it. It also saves you money if you want the director's cut of Friend in Need, as its included in this boxed set. Granted there are other episodes I would have chosen, but until I get the seasons this will work for me just fine. Great buy, and any Xena fan would want it for their collection.

Just wanted to mention, one thing I also love are the black and white pictures on the inside glossy dvd covers. The show's greatest moments are actually compiled on six discs, with the seventh being nothing but extras. The commentary is also wonderful, as its nice to see Lucy [Lawless] and Renee [O'Connor] laughing and enjoying the show just as much,if not more than, as the fans.",1160179200,33,1114,4.304761904761905

This is not even close to what I'd assemble as an ""essential"" list. Season 4 I can understand, as that was not well accepted overall. I guess I just find it hard to believe that this is truly representative of fan desires (and I've been a huge Xena fan since the show's start.) Perhaps the fans shouldn't have been involved at all! A list of shows showing Xena's evolution, starting with her appearance on Hercules, and ending with her death - and all comedy and non-arc stories generally excluded - would have gone a lot farther.",1141948800,23,723,4.484848484848484
2211375,5,B0007DA3VG,"I am in the city Xena was filmed in. I have good friends and myself who were all extras in various episodes. I feel very proud knowing that this is the first great NZ production, followed ofcourse by Hercules , Lord of the Rings and King Kong. Take Notice world, NZ is on its way up!!!!

Buy this great piece of TV as you can watch them again and again!! You will never get bored and you will see great NZ Acting!",1139529600,6,413,4.036585365853658

It should be bought like this, all at once. That way you can watch it all the way through and experience the greatness of Xena :)",1133827200,6,158,4.096774193548387
2211377,5,B0007DA3VG,"hi, as an UK fan i had the less superior region 2 UK releasee dvd boxsets the orignal releases whick they mixed season 1 up because they released the boxsets in 2 parts and part 1 disc 3 of the first half of season 1 had the epiosodes for later on in the season on them so you had to buy the next  half of the  to get all of season 1.

and the UK region 2 release boxsets had only a few extras on each season mainly just cast bigraphies or still galleries, i had heard people saying that the Amercian anchor bay releases were much superior, so because i have a multi region dvd player and a tv that supports NTSC  , i saved up my money and got some one to to send me a season each weeek , which took me about 6 weeks and then sold my UK ones on!!!

and i can certainly say this i was impress with the American releases !

i would recommend anyone to get the American releases over anything!!!",1130716800,,892,3.9277777777777776
2211378,5,B0007DA3VG,"I've been a Xena Fan since season 1 and I am so glad I waited for the DVDs to come out. I was fortunate that I bought my set directly from Anchor Bay as part of their promotion after season 6 was released. The extras are not that different from what my GF has when she bought each set individually so if that's the only thing that's weighing your decision, it may not be worth it. The series was excellent and I'm glad that I can watch it whenever I want. Now it's on to buy the 10th Anniversay Set. Battle On!!",1127347200,18,511,4.019607843137255
2211379,4,B0007DA3VG,"I love Xena-the Warrior Princess. I think that Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor did an awesome job portraying Xena and Gabrielle. While I appreciate the aspects of their relationship, I felt that the 10th Anniversary set left much to be desired. It is still a must buy for a serious fan due to the interviews and insights given by the actors, directors, etc involved with the show. I know that they must have polled fans to get the episodes, but I have to wonder how the Debt and Sin Trade were left off. Not to mention so many other episodes that dealt with my favorite aspect of the show which was Xena's redemption for her dark past. The packaging is nice and it is nice to see Lucy and Renee talking about the show.",1126569600,13,718,4.365671641791045
2211380,4,B0007DA3VG,"This 10th Anniversary Collection is very well packaged. I do wish it had a few more episodes, but some of my favorites are included (""A Day in the Life,"" ""Been There, Done That,"" ""The Bitter Suite,"" ""The Ides of March""). The one episode I didn't particularly care to see included was ""Is There a Doctor in the House?"" but I guess fans liked the ""Gabrielle is mortally wounded"" aspect (similar to her plight in ""One Against an Army""), or else the ""female relationship"" angle. Although I hated the series finale (""A Friend in Need"") at the time it aired, and have been quite bitter about it for years now, viewing the finale again has tempered my feelings considerably. There is a certain undeniable logic that justifies Xena's mortal end, and her brutal demise is softened by the visual presence of her spirit. I must say, I truly appreciate the theatrical quality of the seamless director's cut, and there are a couple of graphic scenes included in this version that did not air on television which definitely enhances the episode's tragic impact.... As for the interviews and featurettes, I really enjoyed most of them. But I simply could not sit through the Robert Trebor piece, first of all because I never cared for the Salmonius character, and second of all because the actor is just too full of himself. Everyone else is delightful, though. I cringed here and there during the Xena Convention piece, didn't care for the Xena reenactments, and absolutely loathed the ""Xena Fanatic"" video. I am a true fan of Xena, but I'm definitely NOT a fanatic. As William Shatner once opined, fanatics need to get a life.... Also, I'm a heterosexual male, and the convention footage and fanatic videos clearly focus on gay fans. I have nothing against this sector of our society, but I do feel that guys like me who found Xena kick-butt sexy should have found a voice in the featurettes somewhere. At any rate, I rarely watch the extras more than once. The real gem here is the collection of Xena episodes, and that makes this 10th Anniversary Collection worth the price of admission.",1125792000,54,2076,4.753462603878116

2211382,2,B0007DA3VG,"I Love Xena, she is one of the most interesting Characters ever on Television, and Lucy Lawless does a fantastic job playing her. One Day, I will own the entire series on DVD. But until then, I bought this collection, to tide me over. I LOVE the box and case designing of the collection, it looks great with the rest of my DVD's.. But as far as Xena Essentials, this just won't do. Granted this collection it is not meant to be the entire series on DVD, but they could have done alot better with the Episode Selection. These are the episodes contained in the set:

ACTUAL EPISODE LIST:

Sins of the Past (Series Premiere Episode)

Callisto

Is There A Doctor In The House?

Been There, Done That

The Bitter Suite

One Against An Army

Fallen Angel

Lyre, Lyre, Hearts On Fire

Amphipolis Under Siege

Motherhood

Old Ares Had a Farm

When Fates Collide

Many Happy Returns

A Friend In Need (1 & 2) (Series Finale)

Now, Some of those are Great Epsidoes, some of those really are Essential.. other's we can live without, we could also use a few more. I wouldn't mind paying $75 or $80 for a collection with a few more episodes that were really essential. I mean, seaons 2 and 4 are almost completely ignored leaving out essential storylines including HOPE, CALLISTO, and CAESAR. (None of those are completely left out as it is, but we don't get enough of any of them). Now, if I were in charge of this, which I'm not.. but if I were, this is how I would do it:

* Episode Additions or Replacements Suggested by Me for any future Xena DVD collections

REMOVED: ""s There a Doctor In the House,"" ""A Day in The Life,"" ""One Against and Army,"" and ""Many Happy Returns"" which are some of the weaker connecting episodes in the series. ""A Day in the Life"" is probably my least favorite Episode in the entire XENA Series. ""One Against an Army"" is hard to take out of an essentials collection, but has to be taken out to make room for more ""essential"" episodes...

I realize that 30 episodes, opposed to 16.. might be a bit excessive. But it is a better collection for it. When an artist releases an album, generally there are 10-14, sometimes 15 tracks on the album. When that same artist releases a greatest hits collection, there are 15-18 tracks, minnimum, and possibly even two discs, sometimes there's even a supplemental remix disc. A Series, like Xena has about 22-26 episodes per season... It's not unforseeable to release a ""Greatest Hits of Xena"" with about 30 episodes.

Personally I wish more thought and preparation had gone into this collection than it did",1123200000,30,3191,4.426597582037997
2211383,5,B0007DA3VG,"Xena Warrior Princess is a remarkable show, and seeing it on a 7 disc set is awesome because i can't afford to buy all the seasons, so i figured this was the next best thing. I liked Xena more then i liked Hercules at the time, because even though that show was also very good, Xena i thought had the better direction out of those 2 shows. Lucy Lawless was so great on portraying Xena, not only beautiful but a really good actress. Same for Renee O' Connor who plays Gabrielle. Ted Raimi, i thought this was his funniest role, playing Joxer, trying to be a warrior, ends up getting his butt kicked everytime.

This show was just so creative, not only in its stories but in its action scenes. Loved the music to the Xena shows, all the amazing scores and the song in the opening credits, it sounds so amazing. I liked this DVD set because i never got the chance to see the last episode of this amazing series. I was amazed by the last episode, the directors cut, i'm guessing a lot of scenes were too violent for TV, which is kind of obvious, the darts looked so painful. Some of the stories, actually make you feel sympathetic towards the characters when they are in danger and on television shows that is a rare thing, usually it only happens in the movies, i find that quite amazing.

Kind of hard to believe this show has been gone since 2001, i think this DVD will make fans of the show very happy, the audio/video commentary, the fan convention where fans tell us what their favorite episodes were. This show had something that i feel no other show can copy, i think we see too many reality shows now. I love fantasy shows like Xena, because there is almost no limitations when it comes to creativity and entertainment.",1123027200,,1724,4.384375
2211384,5,B0007DA3VG,"I was skeptic of buying this, because I have all the seasons, so I would be spending another 50 bucks for the same episodes, but remembered it's Xena, I have to collect all Xena dvds.  I even have the series finale ""A Friend In Need Pt 1 & 2"" on dvd with Directors Cut.  The Dvd set is amazing, it's not made out of paper (the outside container) which helps keep it in shape, and the inside is just great.  They went back to the first three seasons set up. They have them all singly not doubled on top of each other.  I haven't had the time to watch the dvd yet, but I hope the picture is tuned up along with the Audio.  It's a buy for every xena fan, and hope in the future they re-release other seasons and make them better.",1122422400,5,726,4.013888888888889
2211385,5,B0007DA3VG,"I give this DVD five stars, only because it is Xena.  As far as content on the set goes, 3 stars, if even that.  I think this should have been a more complete package, featuring some sort of extras on EVERY episode.  Plus, the SOTP Audio Commentary by Lucy and Renee is a bit of a let down, as there are large gaps where nothing is said.  At first, I thought my DVD player was malfunctioning.  However, the artwork and packaging design is awesome.  So, as the previous reviewer said, this is a good bookend to an incredible series.  I just wish Anchor Bay would have taken more care in producting the set.  Battle On, Xena!",1122336000,6,623,4.310344827586207
2211386,4,B0007DA3VG,"If you are a die-hard, this set fills the Xena void quite nicely with some new featurettes, interviews and other extras. However, I was left feeling a little bit empty, since most (if not all) the audio/video commentary by Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor is the same that was found on the season sets. The tiny snapshot this 16-episode set provides is created by the fans, and we all know that no two fans are alike. Therefore I would only recommend this set as a bookend to the full series - because in the case of Xena, what was most important was the journey, not the destination.",1122336000,6,583,4.457943925233645
2211387,5,B0007DA3VG,"I have bought all six seasons separately from Best Buy. They are the only store to sell the ""Exclusive Bonus Content"" boxes for each season. The bonus is simply an extra 30-minute interview per season. Many of the episodes have their own commentaries by members of the cast and crew. The later seasons have more than the earlier ones. However, I don't know if they made additional interviews just for Best Buy or used some leftover stuff. I've seen too many to notice or care, but I always appreciate seeing each one and have not failed to watch any (maybe I'll skip the Ulysses bonus content though :). I've heard the ending is slightly different on the director's cut final episode available separately. If you have to have it all, go to Best Buy and get your discs there. They are priced at about $55 a pop, so you'll end up spending about the same.

It would sure be nice to get them all in a single box, book-style packaging like they did with a very-limited edition Buffy in the UK, but I would be kicking myself for not being able to wait if they did. It's taken over two years to eventually release them all.

The quality of packaging for each season is outstanding, to put it mildly. The seasons are fold-out over-and-over style, which is no problem if your DVD is next to the floor, as mine is, but you sure can't hold it while folding it all out. In the second half of the series, they went to putting two DVD's per fold-out page, instead of one disc per page like the earlier seasons. The small inconvenience is pulling out the front disc to get to the back one. You'll notice the later season's are slightly slimmer for this reason, but when you are up to nine or ten discs including the bonus CDs, they must have felt a need to do something.

As a guy, I must say that I like all the fine-looking ladies who grace the beautiful cast of this series (Aphrodite, Gabby, Xena, Callisto, Discord, Mavigan, Tara, the Furies, Valhalla chicks, etc.). Of course, the appeal of this series is the friendship of Xena and Gabby. I could have done without so much Joxer, who was the non-threatening, non-sexual comic relief featured in a few too many episodes. I'm not seeing as much Ares as I expected. The Gods spent a good deal of their time on the Hercules set, so I'll have to eventually get that series too. I wouldn't mind watching both together in broadcast order, since the gods often went back and forth between the shows. Too bad that Cupcake (not a god) never crossed over to the Xenaverse (bet you never saw a review mention that :).

I started watching it after flippin' channels and seeing Discord for the first time. Wonderfully, she pales in comparison to the quality of the series. There are very few episode(s) that are not excellent. The costumes are fantastic, the music is the best I've heard on a TV show, the locations are beautiful, the storytelling is always rich, and the casting and acting are what kept me coming back every week, and like every night in syndication. You need the DVDs. It's very nice to watch it on demand, without commercials, with a superior quality picture (when viewed in progressive scan 480p or better) and the knowledge that nothing's been cut. You should enjoy the whole thing, every season.

Maybe someday they will release a widescreen version. Starting with Xena Season 3, episode 3 (since the first two eps of season 3 were shot during the tail end of season 2 and held over), Xena was filmed in 16:9 widescreen. All editing and effects were added to the widescreen version prior to chopping it down to 4:3 for broadcast in the US and elsewhere. Do an Internet search and you'll find Michael Hurst's interviews on the subject.",1122163200,77,3685,4.535338345864662
2211388,5,B0007DA3VG,"There's not much detail here with regards to this set, so I thought I'd supply what I've been able to find out (basically, what Creation has published).

What we have here is basically a ""fan's collection"" of favorate Xena and Gabby ""relationship"" episodes. Thier mythology if you will.

This seven disc collection includes episodes from each season of the series (and I have to agree that there are quite a few favorites included here) :

Callisto (from Season 1) - A GREAT Episode.
Is There A Doctor In The House (from Season 1)
A Day In The Life (from Season 2) - One of the most popular.
Been There Done That(from Season 3)
The Bitter Suite (from Season 3) - The musical episode.
One Against An Army (from Season 3)
The Ides Of March (from Season 4)
Fallen Angel (from Season 5)
Lyre, Lyre, Hearts On Fire (from Season 5)
Amphipolis Under Siege (from Season 5)
Motherhood (from Season 5)
Old Ares Had A Farm (from Season 6)- Featuring a great supporting performance by the late Kevin Smith.
When Fates Collide (from Season 6)
Many Happy Returns (from Season 6)
A Friend In Need Parts 1 and 2 (the finale from Season 6)

More Details :

Original Full-Frame Presentation.

2005 10th Anniversary Xena Convention: This is a yearly Creation Entertainment Event and an outstandingly fun time. Both Lucy and Renee participate.

Comic Relief - First time interview with actor Robert Trebor on his character Salmonius.

Xena's Hong Kong Origins - Explore the influence on the style and action of Xena by Hong Kong action movies with the show's creators Rob Tapert, Liz Friedman, David Pollison and Doug Lefler.

Mythology vs. Xena - Alexandra Tydings and others talk about her Mythological character, Aphrodite in both Xena and Hercules. Alex is a frequent convention guest and a very good actor who seems to appreciate her fans. Nice to see her included here.

Extras: A documentary - Explore the life of an extra on the set and at home in New Zealand while working on the production of Xena: Warrior Princess.

There are also some fan contest items that to me seem like a lot of filler, but the fans they feature are sure to enjoy them.

All and all, this seems a good set.

Enjoy.
