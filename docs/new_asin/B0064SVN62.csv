4953057,3,B0064SVN62,"This is just a recording of a made for television concert.  It is in a brightly lit theater and is missing a lot of the feel of a true UM concert.  Also missing is the great light show that UM is know for.  Don't get me wrong, the music, sound and video quality are all good, but it just felt a little watered down and lacking.",1363737600,3,327,3.9242424242424243
4953058,4,B0064SVN62,"Had been hearing about Umphrey's for years as they are always playing in St Louis.
Got a new Blue Ray for Christmas, and saw this DVD...fate.
Great band, interesting music, fabulous look on this DVD.
Good thing they are all good looking guys or those close ups would be killer.
Don't think I'd want to see a new live video of The Stones on Blue Ray.",1362096000,,349,4.303030303030303
4953059,5,B0064SVN62,"UM is one of my favorite all-time bands.  I have both the DVD and Blu-ray versions of this concert.  Other than the two bonus tracks on the DVD, the concerts are the same.  In terms of sound and video quality, they are not.  The Blu-ray version is light years superior to the DVD.  The DVD is 480p with HQ MP3 sound (probably 480mp3 at best).  The Blu-ray is 1080i (not 1080p) with uncompressed DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 and uncompressed PCM stereo.  If you like UM as much or more than I do, then you might want to look at another band from the 1970's.  It seems as if UM picked up where this other band left off.  Their name is Gentle Giant. The style and timing similarities between the two should be obvious.  I did contact UM through their official website.  They did confirm that Gentle Giant, among other bands, did indeed have an influence on UM's direction.  Very cool!  Go to Youtube and type in Gentle Giant and listen for yourself.  Anyway, this is a great concert to own.  Especially the Blu-ray version.",1345507200,8,1015,4.410810810810811

Love the picture and audio quality, such a great band!",1329696000,,95,3.8
4953061,5,B0064SVN62,"I bought this as a replacement for the DVD version but will be keeping both now as the Blu-Ray does not include the bonus tracks ""Made To Measure"" and ""Wizard Burial Ground"".

I was going to rate this 4/5 stars but don't want to be ""that guy"" so 5/5 it is!  I don't really care whether or not Greedo shot first in the Star Wars cantina scene either ;-)

The bottom-line is that I love this content in both formats.  If I recall, the DVD version says it is high-definition though it is in regular DVD (dual-layer) format.  It seemed to up-convert quite well . . .",1329091200,,562,4.214953271028038

8492868,4,B0064SVN62,"I demand blu-ray concert discs be well-recorded audio and the video editing and camera work *not* be annoying. This production delivers on both demands. Besides, UM is in fine form. Just a couple over-length jams that get a bit tedious, but well worth the time and money. Although this was obviously a 'made for video' concert without UM's normal tour extravagances, it shows there superb ability to just play.",1438646400,,410,4.956521739130435

8492871,3,B0064SVN62,"On any given night of the week, a live Umphrey's McGee show is a mystical jam rock experience. Performed with musical wizardy, the rockin' songs are filled with extraordinary sonic textures. The nuanced soundscape is always accompanied by an amazing light show that is the perfect visual accompaniment. As a sanitized depiction of Umphreys MGee, Soundstage doesn't really capture any of these things, but ""Live"" is still an enjoyable experience. In contrast to a typical Umphreys show, the PBS crowd is unnaturally restrained and the band is seen under medically approved white lights for the entire show. Things start off a on high note with 'Ocean Billy,' one of the band's epic tunes. Next up is another sparkler, the reggae infused 'Higgins.'  While 'Got Your Milk (Right Here)' is a lame tune, it is followed by the more ambitious, 'Out Of Order.' 'Great American' is a genteel instrumental song that gives the band a serious chance to stretch-out. As the title track of their 2007 release, 'Bottom Half' is more mediocrity. 'Walletsworth' is a return to glory. This is a song that captures Umphrey's Mcgee's signature sound. For this tune, the band employs their time-tested musical formula. 'Believe the Lie ' is an equally strong classic. Not to be outdone, 'Eat' is quintessential Umphrey's McGee style instrumental jam rock, so it is cerebral yet smokin'.  While playing tasty powerchords that allude to classic metal, it also has an intellect that is rooted in jamband cleverness. 'Words' delivers philosophically deep lyrics but uninspiring music. While 'Morning Song' is rewarding, 'Alex's House' is okay. As the name suggests, the show ends on a high note with 'Glory.' As would be expected in a PBS product, there's no delightfully kitschy second set cover song. The camera footage is straight forward and the audio is in surround sound. ""Live"" offers a mixed bag from the ""Death By Stereo"" time period. While possessing strengths, this doesn't touch the band's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jam-in-the-Dam/dp/B000EPFDEO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jam in the Dam</a>"" performance. All in all, Soundstage's ""Live"" offers some great songs but compared to the growing amount of Umphrey's McGee DVDs and Blu-rays out there, it can't be considered essential.",1395705600,5,2309,5.411111111111111
8492872,5,B0064SVN62,"In recent years I have re-watched this concert over and over, more than any other, and it continues to fascinate me!  These guys are nothing short of amazing!  Why this band is not more popular than they are is something I don't understand.  And this concert, (unlike several of their other live performances), seems to be devoid of profane comments and lyrics, something I greatly appreciate.  (The only reason I even know about Umphrey's McGee is because I just happened to see the shortened one-hour version of this concert on PBS's Sound Stage, and I'm glad I did.  Since then I've purchased two retail copies.)",1375142400,3,615,4.819047619047619
8492873,5,B0064SVN62,"These guys are really good and this recording is excellent. Video and sound are very clean.
