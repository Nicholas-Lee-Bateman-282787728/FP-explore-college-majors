7969485,3,B00006IUGW,"Rating is based on everyone's perception, and on what each one is looking for in a piece of music. I am New Age fanatic, so I am really concern about sounds, relaxation, smoothness, and sound transitions. This DVD has good classical master pieces, which is good, but far what I was expecting to listen. Now the images leave you speechless, not precisely for what you are watching, but for the minutes after minutes you will be seating seeing the same image. It seems to the director it was great idea to leave a camera rolling, looking at sea, capturing the seashore and waves. Some people will find that exiting but it is not for me.
In conclusion, if you want to listen great classical music, this DVD is good, and that might be relaxing in some way, but be prepare for the images you will see.",1065571200,5,796,4.458904109589041
