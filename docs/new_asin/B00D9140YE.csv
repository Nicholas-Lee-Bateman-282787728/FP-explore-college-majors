8603303,1,B00D9140YE,"Jeff Slaughter tries to hard to ""be cool"" I was hoping for choreography - maybe even group moves-  instead it is all 1 guy doing fast sign language with difficult moves. His suggested moves are Far far too difficult for kids younger that 10 years old. Also, the Musical itself is hard to listen to due to the annoying voices they used for ""PAW PAW"" and Miss LaToe. We are doing the musical but have NO USE for this DVD. It was a total waste of money. We will choreograph it ourselves. Jeff, do yourself a favor, grow old gracefully, it's not that bad.",1380844800,2,551,4.298076923076923
