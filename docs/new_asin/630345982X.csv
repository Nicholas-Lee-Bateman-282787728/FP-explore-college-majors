7848183,1,630345982X,"This is not only in very poor quality for VHS, but its not even the right actors listed!  I wanted the Australian version, it is those actors who are listed, so I expected to receive that version.  Instead, it is the one set in New Zealand.  So for anyone wanting the series with Bella, you're wasting you money, its not that version.  Please, redo your information so that other people are not buying this thinking it has these actors.  The series you are actually selling has Amber McWilliams, William Lucas and Stacy Dorning in it.

I would like to add that all versions of Black Beauty and the New Adventures of Black Beauty are wonderful, timeless classics, that I love to watch.",1395878400,,684,4.565573770491803
7848184,3,630345982X,"These ""New Adventures"" are okay. Black Beauty is as beautiful as ever, but something is still lacking. Recommended for YOUNGER horse lovers. Overall, it's kind of cheezy, with a few flawless scenes.",1120176000,,198,5.21875
7848185,4,630345982X,"This television production is family entertainment at its zenith.  Perhaps best suited for girls (my daughters take turns pretending they are Vickie, the lead character), although both my three-year old son and I love it as  well.
Tightly constructed moralistic tales, interesting characters,  solid acting, gorgeous scenery (New Zealand), sentimental music and a  terrific horse. 4+ stars from a picky person.",943228800,5,410,5.672131147540983
