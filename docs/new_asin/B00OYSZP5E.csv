6776520,3,B00OYSZP5E,I bought it specifically to see Jamie Dornan in something other than FSOG.  At first I didn't understand what this movie was about and figured it out further into the movie.  Jamie is a businessman who is told to buy a racing pigeon for a sheik.  Once I realized what this was I enjoyed it so much more.  However its just an okay movie.,1521590400,,336,4.203125

6776523,1,B00OYSZP5E,"This movie is terrible as it promotes animal cruelty. Pigeon racing is a real thing that exists in the real world today whereas humans make profits of raising pigeon isolated in cages, separated from their families, without air and light, only to one day ship and transport them miles away and have them try to find their home back by flying miles, most of the times dying on the way. Just like horse racing and greyhound racing this is an extremely cruel and inhumane business and ""sport"" and should be banned immediately. Animals are God's creatures and were not created for our entertainment, fashion or food. Please do not support this. Please connect the dots. Thank you.",1519430400,,676,4.786324786324786

6776525,5,B00OYSZP5E,"Simple movie about the slow process of love developing, which is felt and nurtured by the ""right"" chemistry between two people. We connect with this movie by the main character's actions which we completely understand for in our lifetime, it has happened, and the movie vicariously wakes up those memories of ours to reminisce our own special moments.
Let the movie take you. Sit and watch with intent and allow your emotions to surface and freedom to take you wherever they will lead you.  You'll be surprised!",1518220800,,511,4.873563218390805

6776580,5,B00OYSZP5E,"Loved this movie. Loved the storyline, the soldier history and the pigeons. I felt it played out at an European pace and I was fine with that. Too many American movies follow a cookie cutter format, after a while that gets boring. I liked Dornan in this and the leading lady as well. I hope at some point he takes a role that lets him keep the brogue. The oddest thing for this whole movie was that it changed names. Flying Home was how it advertised last year but I found it under Racing Hearts on Amazon this year. Not sure what's up with that? Anyway, great movie for a day in.",1490572800,5,580,4.1875

6776614,1,B00OYSZP5E,"I was disappointed when I saw Jaime Dornan in ""Fifty Shades of Grey.""
 I was even more disappointed when I saw him in ""RACING HEARTS."" He was miscast as a powerful businessman that put the dollar ahead of personal relationships. And just like in ""Fifty Shades,"" there was absolutely NO chemistry between him and his ""RACING HEARTS"" leading lady.
""The Fall"" is probably one of the best vehicles that I have seen him in but I was so disappointed to see that he was cast as a serial killer. He is just too fine for a role like that.
Even though I was not impressed with his acting abilities (and I don't like the goofy way he walks), I still look forward to seeing him in ""FIFTY SHADES DARKER!"" even though his character, Christian Grey, is way too misogynistic.",1485302400,,759,4.460431654676259

I found this movie to be lacking depth- thin and superficial. It could have used a script writer with a high school vocabulary.  While I was looking forward to at least some beautiful shots of Flanders, unfortunately the camera work left a lot to be desired. The only saving grace was Charlotte De Bruyne.

6776720,3,B00OYSZP5E,"This movie was just okay. I am really trying to give Jamie Dornan the benefit of doubt but his acting skills in love stories is borderline bad! He is just not comfortable kissing women on screen. I thought it was just his chemistry with Dakota Johnson in 50 Shades of Grey but after seeing this movie I think it's just awkward for him to have chemistry with any woman on screen. He really needs to work on his on screen chemistry with the opposite sex! You just can't look sexy, you have to act sexy too! There is still work for him in Hollywood as a model but it pains me to say this but maybe he should just leave the sexy leading man roles to the professionals!",1462147200,,664,4.1953125

6776738,5,B00OYSZP5E,"A charming and delightful movie with real life historical trivia built in.  I rented it bc I wanted to learn more about Jaime Dornan (from 50 shades of grey) and was treated to much, much more.  I am only second generation American from European immigrants after WWII. So I particularly enjoyed the European actors and Belgium setting.  The title, ""Racing Hearts"" is descriptive of how fast pigeons' hearts beat.  The movie weaves in the very moving true story of Cher Ami (French for ""dear friend"", in the masculine) the female homing pigeon who had been donated by the pigeon fanciers of Britain for use by the U.S. Army Signal Corps in France during WWI and saved the lives of 600 allied soldiers who were trapped behind enemy lines in the Battle of Argonne. There is a special graveyard in Flanders, Belgium for the soldiers who were ""pigeoneers."" The statue and story of Cher Ami can be found in the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.  Other than that, the acting is compelling, believable and refreshing. The story and characters build and surprise. I highly recommend. Even if you're not a history buff it's still a pleasant way to spend 90 minutes. And if you are, all the better!",1456876800,3,1209,4.738095238095238

I also really like him in The Fall, but it is a show I can't watch all the time!  I loved the pace of the movie, it moves slower, which is really how most  things in life happen!  I love the fact they included history into the mix and I am an animal lover so I also liked the story line.  I would like to see more movies where we can hear his amazing accent!  The struggle Colin goes through to do the right thing was amazing to see the transformation.  I thought the love story was amazing and sweet.  In the US we want things fast and now----why can't we be patient and let things unfold at a more believeable pace---- in life and in movies?!?!

The movie shows the time, care, and emotional link that is created from training the birds and gives a decent amount of history, without boring you.  The two leading stars were very good.  Personally, I thought Jamie's character started out a bit rigid and cold, but he warmed up.  Charlotte De Bruyne is lovely and heart-warming.  The supporting cast was fantastic.

All-in-all, I liked the pace and thought this was a beautifully told love story and how love can change a person for the better.  The movie reflects upon the age-old story that money is not what we take with us in the end.",1445126400,,729,4.596899224806202

6776813,3,B00OYSZP5E,It started slowly with lots of background that may not seem necessary until it all comes together in the end. This is a heartwarming story about a man who comes to realize who he really is and what he truly needs to be whole and happy. Easy to see how this part could have helped Dorman land his role in 50 SHADES OF GREY. Don't expect sexy scenes tho. Sweet film overall,1441324800,,371,4.166666666666667

6776815,3,B00OYSZP5E,An ultimately moving story about an unusual hero of WW I but Dornan's character is not fully realized and wooden and  the love interest is not convincing.  Too bad because the plot is interesting.,1441152000,,196,4.735294117647059

6776817,2,B00OYSZP5E,"I wanted to watch this movie to see some more of Jamie Dornan's acting. I think he's a strong actor but this was not a strong project. The part about the pigeons was enlightening in explaining the fascination with them, but the plot around the pigeons just wasn't present enough. This was basically a lackluster film for him. That explains why it went straight to DVD releases earlier this year (2015) ahead of 50 Shades... I do look forward to his other movies coming up...",1440979200,5,474,4.588235294117647

6776824,5,B00OYSZP5E,"Though obviously low-budget, this is a sweet, original and unusual movie. The pidgeon story-line based on a true event was lovely. The priest's housekeeper almost stole the movie. Loved her character and acting. I don't know if Dornan made this movie before 50 Shades (probably) but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was great seeing Dornan as a man with integrity instead of someone who beats women (50 Shades of Grey) or murders them. (The Fall.) Regardless of what movie he is in, I will watch it because he is just too marvelous to look at and his acting is quite good. This movie was a surprise treat.",1439596800,18,600,4.616822429906542

6776833,5,B00OYSZP5E,"This is a lovely film and though I wouldn't dare consider myself a movie critic, I found a bit of everything here.  It's a beautiful love story--not just between the humans, but delicately and wonderfully illuminates the incredible bond people share with animals.  Naturally it appealed to my animal-loving nature but I loved the unfolding of love between Jamie and  Isabelle.  He's a very talented actor with great insight and a richness to his soul.  I loved how he came to Belgium with ideas only to pursue great financial gain but realized as the journey progressed that wealth cannot provide everything and his transformation from cold-hearted business magnate to a feeling man with hopes and desires is especially sweet.  All the actors were wonderful. I loved the economy of speech and the scenery was gorgeous.  Mr. DeMarco's score was perfect for the film.  I'm a big fan of film scores and I will now pay closer attention and look for his name in future films.  His work reminds me of the great Jerry Goldsmith.  For those who are quick to say it dragged and moved much too slow, I say, slow down.  Learn to look for the beauty.  It's always there.",1439078400,3,1158,4.706467661691542

There was much more excitement and romance in the trailer than what was really portrayed. Jamie Dornan is a great actor and did very well in his character role. I was always drawn to him. I was less than impressed with the female lead. The timeline didn't work too well in this movie.

This was a very poignant and educational love story.  Loved Jamie's role as Colin and also loved ""Isabel"".  I love movies with happy endings.  I actually learned something about the history of pigeons.  I knew that they were used to carry messages but didn't realize their importance in the war.
In all, I have to give this movie 5 stars and I definitely will be watching it again.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves romance.

This is a little known movie about learning there is such a thing as real love out there and finding it in unusual places.  The movie moves a bit slow in the beginning but Jamie does a great job in his role of a hard-assed businessman wanting to get to the bottom line and not caring who gets in the way.  Little beknown to him, he finds out he does have a heart.  There is a surprise ending also.  I would recommend giving this DVD a chance.  I really liked it.",1428019200,4,539,4.037735849056604

He is! he is a bigshot NY businessman, he wants to do a big deal with a Dubai Sheik, the Sheik will if Jamie gets him a promising future winner of pigeon racing from his Belgian owner! Yep, I could not believe it either, pigeon racers, apparently big in Europe. I was fascinated by that aspect of it too. Fell in love with the bird too. he woos, yes woos, the Belgians granddaughter and well....I don't want to tell you too much, suffice it to say.....I really loved, loved this movie, romance, intrigue, pigeons and Belgians and Sheiks.....what more can you want?

6776993,4,B00OYSZP5E,I was impressed with this movie.  Dornan plays a ethically challenged businessman that redeems himself in the end.  I also liked the history regarding the pigeons and their use in World War 1.,1427414400,2,192,4.787878787878788
6776994,5,B00OYSZP5E,"This is a simple story of an ambitious man coming to terms with himself and finding love in the process. It was good enough for me to watch twice. The topic driving the story is interesting, the settings are beautiful and Jamie Dornan did a fine job in the lead role. I had never heard of him before 50 Shades. Now I'm a fan and am looking forward to watching The Fall. One of the things that fascinates me about acting is how actors and actresses who are not American produce an American accent. How much concentration does it take to do that? I've seen JD in interviews since 50 Shades and he speaks naturally with what I call a thick Irish brogue, so much so that with my Texas ear, I sometimes had a hard time understanding him. Yet, in both this movie and in 50 Shades, he sounds like an American.",1427328000,18,802,4.248366013071895

He played the nice guy well but what I loved was when he turned into the heartless business man when speaking with Jos. He was cold but you could also see it was difficult for him to do it. You could see the struggle of doing what he knew he was there for and the feelings he was starting to develop for Isabelle and the other people he meets.
I found the whole racing thing very interesting and the level in which trainers care and bond with their birds.

6777048,5,B00OYSZP5E,"This was a very unique film, blending historical reference and a sweet romance.  The cinematography was beautiful, and the story will make you cry.  Who knew that racing pigeons was such a passion?  Jamie Dornan plays a hard as nails businessman that is out to broker a deal with a very rich man from Dubai and never thought he would fall in love and muddy the waters of his financial coup.  At one point I thought there was no way he was going to do what was right, and it is painful to watch him wrestle with his conscience.  You will find yourself drawn into the story and falling in love with the people in this Belgium village.  Our heroine is so sweet, and Charlotte De Bruyne is an actress worthy of the craft.  You are drawn to her character immediately, she will warm your heart as will this film.  I highly recommend it.  It is not your average rom-com.

I will admit that I bought this because Jamie Dornan was in 50 Shades and I wanted to know about his other work. I saw him in The Fall, which he is wonderful in, so I was now very interested in his other work. Admittedly, if I were just looking for movies to buy, the plot isn't one that would have hooked me in. I probably would have not bought it. But I was pleasantly surprised. Jamie was fantastic in it, but that's not the only reason I liked the movie. I thought it was very well done. The characters were engaging; the script and acting superb all around. And the story really did reel me in.

I read some reviews that said that the pacing was too slow. But, I thought it was excellent. The story unfolded in a natural way that was just right in order for the characters and relationships to be developed.

6777093,3,B00OYSZP5E,"This movie was originally listed on IMDB as being titled Flying Home, although the cover art has recently been updated to show the new title. I thought the movie was entertaining--its a sweet story about a guy who does something reprehensible for money, but then tries to make it right because he has fallen in love. Jamie Dornan has a passable American accent, although you can still hear the Irish in his voice at odd moments (and to be honest, I much prefer the sound of him speaking in his normal voice/accent). Charlotte de Bruyne is fantastic as Isabelle, and I thought Dornan and de Bruyne had good chemistry together. Supporting characters were all well written and acted.

The main drawback to the movie is that the plot and characters were predictable. There were really no surprises here or complicated characters (actually some the supporting characters had more complexity than the main two characters) Of course, we knew that he would choose the girl over money. Still overall, it was watchable and entertaining.",1422835200,18,1026,4.930635838150289

6777104,4,B00OYSZP5E,"A WONDERFULLY DEVELOPED STORY THAT IS SLIGHTLY LESS MELODRAMATIC AND SLIGHTLY SLOWER THAN SOME U.S. AUDIENCES ARE USED TO.

WHY SOME AREN'T LIKING IT:  The central relationship progresses at a more natural pace that will seem slow to some viewers.  The budget is modest and the film slightly less polished.  However, the production values are still excellent and the settings are beautiful.  The homing pigeons may seem un-compelling to some, but are central to the premise of ""finding your way home"".  Another failure of expectations is the media hype connecting this show with 50 Shades of Grey.  Jaime Dornan stars in both, but this movie is nothing like 50 Shades.  This is not an erotic thriller.  Some have criticized Dornan's acting while others watch specifically because of him.  Wherever you fall on that debate, there are some terrific supporting characters (grandfather, B&B lady) and I thought De Bruyne was terrific.  For those not interested in a slightly slower paced, somewhat more chaste love story, this will not likely meet your tastes.

INTRO: This wonderful story takes something seemingly small and mundane like racing birds (pigeons) and contrasts them with the exciting, jet set life of a powerful young businessman and his multi-billion dollar deal.  It weaves a layered story of the need to close his deal, and the lives of real people that present an impediment. Ultimately, he will have to choose between someone he loves and a deal that could cost his career.

THE STORY (no spoilers):  Colin Montgomery is a high octane N.Y. businessman trying to land a multi-billion dollar deal with a Dubai Sheik.  It is the deal of his career so far, and he is the type of person that always wins.  The problem is that the sheik has already decided to go with a competitor though the deal isn't done.  Colin flies to meet the sheik and realizes his predicament.  While discussing the issue, Colin learns the sheik has a unique interest.  Racing pigeons.  It seems silly, but the sheik is passionate and he desires a champion bird owned by a man in Flemish Belgium.  Colin promises to deliver the bird if the sheik places his money with Colin's firm.  Colin pretends to be a school teacher while traveling to the rural Belgian town so he can scope out the situation and find an angle to get the bird.  As fate would have it, Colin meets the gentleman's granddaughter Isabelle first, and is drawn to her.  That's where the tale starts to pick up steam.  Colin isn't using his real identity and he will have to play hardball with her grandfather, yet he has genuine esteem for Isabelle.  The movie builds further on the conflict and sets up the unraveling of Colin's secret.  A little WWI folklore is thrown in for good measure as Colin researches a lost ancestor.

OTHER THOUGHTS: The first 20 minutes start a little slow as they construct the tale.  Many back stories also need to be filled in to explain why it all matters.  Though this may seem slow to many viewers, it's actually what helps the viewer care.  I felt even the back stories become interesting later on.  Jamie Dornan seems slightly stiff at the beginning of the movie.  I was able to accept that eventually as appropriate for a high stakes businessman from the big city.  Charlotte De Bruyne as Isabelle is wonderful and makes you feel someone could really care that much for someone.  I suspect this movie is getting a U.S. release well timed to promote Jamie Dornan's role in 50 shades of Grey.  However, this movie stands on it's own for quality.  There are still a few minor plot holes and it requires one to make a few leaps.  That's not unusual for a movie like this.  A few of the supporting cast also have tremendous characters that are very well acted.  Even the idea of pigeon racing makes sense by the end.  One of the alternate names of this movie is ""Flying Home"", which is a fitting simile for the pigeons and Colin as he finds his real center, both with his parents and other matters.  I know many U.S. viewers won't be use to the pacing and style of this movie, and I hope I have described enough for them as well.  I feel it gives the tale a little more substance and a sense of authenticity.  If you are into the genre and enjoy European movies, you will likely enjoy this one.  You might want to give it a rent first though.

RATING & CONTENT:  There is no rating on the version I am reviewing.  However, there is no nudity and very little sexual situation.  There are a few F words and other language.  Minus the language this is a fairly clean movie and even a little uplifting and inspirational.  That is pretty unusual nowadays.",1421280000,81,4635,4.638376383763838

If Im being completely honest, though, it was too slow and predictable. Also, theres something missing in the relationship between the two main characters who end up falling in love. There is a complete lack of chemistry and not enough connection or storyline to make these two believable as anything but mere acquaintances. It fails overall as a romance. Ive seen Jamie Dornan in The Fall, a disturbing but very well done series. Dornan was fantastic in it, though came off stiff and detached in this one. Maybe the Romance genre is not his thing.

Don't get me wrong, we've seen the Fifty Shades movies and find them intriguing.  So you are aware, this movie is nothing like that.  In fact, it was very refreshing to see a romantic drama that is not about sex.  This couple had a great chemistry together and the movie included some genuine feelings and historic storyline.  I know this is one movie we will watch over and over again!",1526256000,,661,4.695652173913044
