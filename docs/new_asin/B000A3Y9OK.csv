8074231,5,B000A3Y9OK,"There are two great films, but this listing could easily confuse people, as the two versions listed together as of this writing have different possible challenges for a US audience.

The DVD set, while region free is in PAL, not the standard US NTSC. That means some DVD players, especially older and/or less expensive ones, may have trouble playing it.  It also may not play on all computers.

The blu-ray has a different issue - it has no English subtitles.

Amazon may well correct this listing at some point, at which time these comments won't make any sense, but for now just be sure you can play what you're buying.

Two part film, that was 1st released as two separate features.  Terrific telling of a complex story of intertwined farming families in rural France in the early part of the 20th century.

The acting is mostly of the highest order.  Yves Montand, one of the most suave men in history is completely believable as a rough hewn, self-centered farmer, Gerard Depardieu, also cast against type, as a gentle, educated city born man trying to make it as a farmer also is astounding.  Almost as good is Daniel Auteuil as Montand's not-very-bright son.  Only Emmanuelle Beart, gorgeous though she may be,  doesn't quite convince me as the wild woman of the fields. Some of it is performance, some of it is how perfect she looks.

The story is wonderful in a Dickensian sort of way, with clues and character elements showing up early, only to pay off three hours later.  I love the first part even more, somehow it feels more truly tragic and dense, the 2nd part just a bit too neat by the end.  But still a grand, intelligent, great looking entertainment.",1455494400,,1668,4.648464163822526
8074232,5,B000A3Y9OK,"I consider this one of the best French movie ever.  I won't talk about the movie itself because you can look on IMDB for actual reviews of this movie.  I'll just talk about this particular Blu-ray disk.
I'm in the US.  I've waited a long time for a US release of this movie but it's still not out.  So I decided to get this EU version.  The picture is light years better than my US DVD by MGM.  I'll have to warn other US buyers that even though the disk indicates region A, B, C are supported; that's not true.  It won't play on my region A player.  I went ahead and bought a region free player and was able to play the movie.",1395532800,2,627,4.0
