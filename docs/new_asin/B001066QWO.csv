The episodes are about five minutes each. I think it's a perfect length that the stories don't tire you.
The dvd menu is simple and easy to understand, giving you no more and no less than what you want.
The voices are really great as well. The english is both amusing and so fitting for this show.
I really encourage buying this dvd. It was great when I was young and it's ever greater now.",1244592000,2,489,4.104166666666667
8237242,5,B001066QWO,"Never has a blue blob of plasticene had so much character!

Poor old Berk, always hurrying around making meals from vile substances for The Thing Upstairs, who we never get to see but who we hear bellowing from above for Berk to hurry up. ""Berk. Where's my dinner""?

Berk's friend is called Boney and is a skeleton's head and sounds very posh, whereas Berk talks with a west country accent and The Thing Upstairs is a cockney Londoner. Then there is Drut, a hidious little thing who is male but who nevertheless has babies! This takes place in the second series. All on the dvd, which contains both, though unfortuntely the theme tune is only available to be heard separately and not at the start of each episode, which is a shame, but I guess they were not wanting to take up too much space or it might have run to two dvds.
In series two, they obviously used new plasticene, and Berk looks decidedly different, as does Boney (as much as a blue blob and a skeleton head _can_ look different! LOL) and the set too looks like different colours have been used. I prefer the first series, but it's all good.
The things that come out of the trap door are really what each story is about, and how poor old Berk has to deal with them. Rog is one of them, but becomes a good friend of Boney and Berk and Drut.

It may be an acquired taste, what with the British accents and all, but see it if you get the chance as it really is very funny if you appreciate this kind of humour.",1211846400,4,1470,4.261648745519714
