8176348,4,B000NA6C4K,"This movie is for anyone who dreams of taking their trailer sailor on an exotic cruise (but most likely won't)! The boat in the movie - a Seaforth - is a pretty unique boat and some of the things he talks about will be hard to apply to a West Wight Potter, for example, but it does get you thinking. I wouldn't say the movie is an exhaustive work on the subject but he includes some things that I bet similar films (if there are any) wouldn't dare touch. Using the head underway, for example - complete with demo (fully clothed, thankfully!). I enjoyed the movie and even caught my wife following some of the discussion. If you pride yourself on having a pretty full sailing library, this should be in it!",1216080000,2,705,4.348484848484849
