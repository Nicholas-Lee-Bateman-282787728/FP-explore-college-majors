7565302,2,B0197U4ZWM,Low budget film. Most of the movie happened at night or in a deep hole making for very dark filming. Could hardly see most of the movie because it was so dark.,1484265600,,159,4.0
7565303,2,B0197U4ZWM,"I started the movie saying, ""that is not how hot air balloons work,"" and I ended the movie saying ""that is NOT how hot air balloons work!""  A tear in the envelope doesn't let out all the helium or whatever the scriptwriter thinks a hot air balloon is full of...a hot AIR balloon is full of AIR.  To make it rise, add heat.  Yes, a tear could let out some hot air and require more firing of the burner (not sure the balloon in this movie even had one on it since they seemed to think it worked like a helium balloon), but it's not like it would ever become ""empty.""

The acting is surprisingly decent for such a bad movie, but the plot is so, so, so, so stupid.  Nothing makes sense.  For some reason, two of the teens trapped on a bus in a hole are selfish, homicidal jerks. Yet one of the homicidal teens is content to let everyone else get rescued from a ledge first (why not just push them off, which would be more in keeping with earlier events?).  Then, suddenly, after waiting through a sappy reconciliation scene, the teen freaks and tries to climb to safety in a stupid way (at the same time a rescuer decided to also be stupid and...) One man has a helicopter and no one thinks to use that, apparently the National Guard, Coast Guard, and other rescue people with equipment were all kidnapped by aliens shortly before this movie began, as well.

Either the scriptwriter ran out of ideas or the budget ran out of dimes because the movie just ends.  One minute, three people are stuck in a sinking hot air balloon and it's ""too heavy"" to rise, and one is talking about jumping out to save the others and the next moment, it cuts to them all safe on top, out of the balloon.  No one jumped, they didn't even try getting nude and tossing clothes or cutting off the basket and clinging to ropes or anything,  Never explained.

It was somewhat entertaining despite the utter stupidity of the plot, so two stars.",1484092800,10,1914,4.330532212885154

If you just listened to the movie, you would get the same experience and understand just as much of the plot as if you watched it.  They also didn't try to really explain anything that happens at all, either the premise or the ending.  It was a very unsatisfactory ending that didn't even have enough warm fuzzies to make up for the lack of plot.

7565375,4,B0197U4ZWM,I really enjoyed this movie. It had a very interesting story-line with believable characters. The movie delved into the actors lives giving them depth and allowing us to empathize with their predicaments. You really feel for them and are rooting for them. And the bad characters you do not have empathy for them but they gave good believable performances. There was much action and peril throughout even though some of the rescue scenes were a bit fantastic. I guess that is where the science fiction comes in.

7565462,1,B0197U4ZWM,"Written by an aficionado of the Disaster Movie genre:
For anyone who enjoys the lunacy of Al Gore, this movie will offer you a ""thrill running up your leg"". However, do be aware that the acting is on par with other movies such as ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"",. It appears several of the ""actors' were just walking by on the street when the movie was being shot and drafted to play parts. Including the three main characters, who don't appear to have a clue what they are doing in front of a camera.

On the other hand, the script for the movie is even worse than the acting. Cliche's abound, diatribes against fracking, global warming, polar bears dying, the sky is falling, and Mars is out of alignment with Jupiter. All of this, while the plot line drags along glacially and is a major pain in Uranus.

We suffered through approximately 20 minutes of this hoping to find a redeeming Disaster Movie worthy scene and some semblance of acting. A forlorn hope quashed when one of the main characters was propositioned by a Teenage Tart on a school bus in a sink hole.

All in all, this movie was bad enough to prompt my cat to attempt suicide by pulling hair off his stomach to make a hairball massive enough to choke on, and the cat obviously does not understand the English language.",1466121600,11,1280,4.461538461538462

7565488,1,B0197U4ZWM,"Boring and tedious.  Imagine taking the most cliched stock characters from any bad teen horror film, throwing them down a hole, and listening them try to out-quip each other for hours on end while their cheesy CGI bus teeters on the edge of an abyss.  Have these stock characters beat you over the head with their fracking-is-bad message, just to up the nuisance factor.  By the end of it, you'll be hoping that the bus would just fall in already, killing everyone on board....but unfortunately, you'll get the dumbest rescue ever witnessed in a disaster flick.  Yes, fracking is bad, and so is this movie.",1464566400,,606,4.742857142857143

7565498,1,B0197U4ZWM,"I hope the ""actors"" in this movie are holding their heads down in shame. I can honestly say that this is the worst movie I have ever watched. I thought with Eric Roberts, the movie would at least pass for a legitimate film. I was wrong. The only 5 star reviews this movie got were from professional reviewers who get a benefit from their reviews. The acting was horrible and unbelievable...the premise of the movie was contrived and smacked of cartoon-like action. The special effects....well, there weren't any. The sinkholes weren't even made to look real and the poor bus looked like something made from a cereal box by a 5 year old in their school craft class. Eric Roberts acted as if this was the first time he had ever been in front of a camera. Of course, you had the obligatory bully and beauty queen and the good girl and hero boyfriend.
Please take my advice and unless you are having a ""Worst Movie Party"" theme, you will want to avoid this stinker like the plague. Come to think of it, the only thing that could help this movie is to infect it with the plague so it will die a slow painful death like it put me through while watching it.",1463875200,2,1150,4.378504672897196

The director must have ignored, or even more likely, did not have any technical advisors on the set, so most of it is totally unbelievable, and the so-called fire dept is a joke.

If you are an established actor and want a roll that's not taking too much time, get something like Eric Roberts' roll.  He was great! If you plan to be riding in a school bus, demand a helmet and some sort of seat belt. They are death traps on wheels. DO NOT take short cuts. If you worry more about how you look than an injured person is the same fix you are, you won't last long. Last but not least, for me, stick with your diet. The lightest weight people were the first to get rescued. (Hope this didn't give too much away) Oh yeah, if you marriage is on the rocks, get one of you needs to almost killed in a disaster and the other one needs to be on the rescue team.  I much prefer things with many legs eating up innocent people, but this movie is timely because fracking was the ""bad guy.""
