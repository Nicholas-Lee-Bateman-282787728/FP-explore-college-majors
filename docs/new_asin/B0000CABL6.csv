1916912,4,B0000CABL6,"I just got this movie today and thought it was cute, funny, and short. Im really not to fond of american animation only for a few shows. This is a good movie if you like Strawberrys or thornberrys lol. Stu gets everyone trapped on a island in the middle of the ocean and Anglecia and Debbie meet each other. Thats the scary part. The funniest part is when Chralet jumps into the ocean to get to the cruise ship that was just funny. A must have if you like thornberrys.",1074729600,,468,4.211111111111111
1916913,1,B0000CABL6,"OK YALL FIRST OF ALL. I WAS FORCED TO SEE THIS MOVIE!
This movie was really really really dumb.
I mean im no fan of the rugrats but adleast it was ok.
There was only two things they really advertised.
There dog could talk and you could smell the movie (so what)
Theres like a million movies with talking Animals and um you can smell it wow scratch and sniff from a shoe store and fast food food joint thats really amazing
no offence to the people who actually liked this  movie",1073347200,2,477,4.184782608695652
1916914,1,B0000CABL6,"I saw this film with my daughter (6 years old) and her friend (7), none of whom are Rugrats fans, mostly because they consider the Rugrat's humor to be too immature and inappropriate. My daughter and I did, however, mostly enjoy last year's The Wild Thornberrys Movie.
The plot is a literal and figurative shipwreck. The Rugrats and their parents end up on an uninhabited island somewhere in the Pacific, on which the Thornberrys happen to be. Various groups and individuals splinter off in search of others. By the time Nigel Thornberry gets knocked on the head and reverts to the mental age of a 3 year-old, I had lost track of who was looking for whom and why. How a kid is supposed to follow all these machinations is beyond me.
The sheer number of characters and the randomness with which they run into each other prevent any sort of character depth from being explored. For example, in The Wild Thornberrys Movie, considerable attention was given to Darwin the monkey, who is one of the more interesting characters in this entire assembly (Darwin is smart and makes very insightful observations of human behavior, but he can only communicate with one person, Eliza - to everyone else, he is a dumb monkey). However, here he has what could be characterized as a cameo appearance at best. So, unless you are already familiar with all the characters, and don't expect much in terms of character development, you'll be disappointed.
I think there was a moral to the story (something about leadership and redemption), but I was nodding off by the end of the movie, having lost track of the plot. The audience I saw the film with was mostly subdued, with only a few audible laughs. My daughter and her friend said they liked the movie, but they like every movie I take them to, as long as I buy them popcorn. They did not talk about the movie at all the rest of the weekend. On the way home, we listened to the Lilo & Stitch soundtrack, which has much better songs than the few musical numbers in this movie.
I'm not giving this movie the worst rating, because it might be enjoyable for a few Rugrat fans. And the Rugrats' potty humor is not as bad as it could have been, although there are diaper jokes, bird droppings, and Spike the dog raises his leg a few times.",1065571200,7,2266,4.54278728606357
1916915,5,B0000CABL6,"Since I seen the film two times like I did with the first
two back in the past I think that Paramount Pictures,
Nickelodeon Movies & Klasky Csupo Inc.
have finaly created a hit that will be remembered as one of
the most top rated animated motion pictures for the next
couple of years in the 21st century. I got to admit that film
had the best musical numbers ever!
and best of all it has S.T.Y.L.E.",1062115200,4,398,4.181818181818182
1916916,3,B0000CABL6,"A slim plot conspires to shipwreck the cast of ""Rugrats"" on a tropical island being explored by the ""Wild Thornberrys"".  Tommy Pickles's father mistakenly thinks that a do-it-yourself cruise is just what everybody wants.  Instead, they all wind up on the shores of an island that is the only known habitat for a white leopard much sought after by Tommy Pickles's hero, Nigel Thornberry (he always manages to keep from getting eaten by ""crocagators"").  The characters meet and face all sorts of adventures which they overcome by working together.
Though longer than a single episode of either show, this movie manages to have less interest than a single episode of each.  My kids loved it, though I remember thinking that last winter's Thornberry's movie was more imaginative, or atleast coherent.  The story is just overwhelmed by the number of different characters trying to steal the show, and doesn't do much with any of them.  (Eliza Thornberry gets barely any time, mostly around because her power to speak with animals is the only way they can explain why Spike suddenly sounds like Bruce Willis).  The animation won't win any awards - when the mystery leopard shows up, it breaks into song voiced by Chrissie Hynde, though it doesn't look or move anything like you'd expect a man-eating feline to if it sounded like it sang for ""The Pretenders"".  If you're looking for a flick your kids will like (and don't mind paying today's ticket prices to watch it), even though you'll probably sleep through most of it, this is your flick.  Nobody makes movies that are amusing for kids and adults anymore, and anybody who thinks otherwise would never consider this flick an example of that rare breed.  The flick has a few early scenes (in which the rugrats explore an imaginary ""train forest"" teeming with vicious animals, and a shipwreck scene obviously suggested by ""A Perfect Storm"") which might scare some kids, but the rest is pretty safe.",1057622400,3,1943,4.896341463414634
1916917,3,B0000CABL6,"She is a HUGE Wild THornberrys fan, and although we don't watch Rugrats, that did little to dampen her enthusiasm for this film.  Perfectly pleasant way to spend some time together.  I happen to get a kick out of Bruce Willis' singing, and was very pleased that Chrissie Hynde was also featured.  As a mom, I preferred The Wild Thornberrys movie, but I forsee at least several more viewings of this film while it's in theatres.  Kick back and enjoy the popcorn.",1055721600,8,461,4.585365853658536
1916918,4,B0000CABL6,"When the vacationing Rugrats and their parents get stranded on a deserted island, Tommy Pickles knows there's only one man who can help them: Nigel Thornberry! Except a bonk on the head has made Nigel suddenly seem more like a 3-year-old than a man. Luckily, the babies have Eliza on their side, and with her ability to communicate with animals, she can even talk to Spike! Will the Rugrats ever make it back to their own back yard? Will Nigel the toddler turn back into a documentary-making dad? Will Spike sound an awful lot like Bruce Willis?. bottom line: good movie to take your kids too",1053820800,25,592,4.59433962264151

1916980,5,B0000CABL6,"I got his movie for my two little nieces because I knew they would love it and they did, and so did I!  This is a delightful and fun filled movie where the Wild Thornberries and the Rugrats meet up in an adventure of a lifetime.

Stranded on a tropical island after their boat capsizes, the Rugrats and their families have to survive in an environment to which they are not at all suited too but help is at hand in the guise of the Wild Thornberries who just happen to be in the area on one of their jaunts.

The adults squabble and bicker (but they all make up and work together when the children are in danger) whilst the Rugrats lurch from one crazy adventure to the next and we are treated to Spike the dog speaking for the first time (Bruce Willis) because everyone knows that Eliza Thornberry has a wonderful secret, she can speak to animals and they understand her and can speak back!

It's a nice movie because it brings together two great animated series, it also is a fun film that young kids can watched and be enthralled with, that is what I like about it the most, it is an enjoyable cartoon romp for the whole family.",1162080000,,1131,4.271028037383178

--------------------------------------------------

The Scratch & Sniff options on the DVD relate to the ""Odorama"" stunt used during the film's original theatrical release. Special numbered cards, each representing a particular smell, were available with kids' meals at participating Burger King restaurants from 6/2/2003 to 6/29/2003, and separately at Blockbuster Video stores from 6/15/2003 until supplies ran out.

Participants picked up the cards, then took them to the local movie theater showing the film. When a particular number flashed on the screen, viewers scratched off the scent that had that particular number on it. Numbers flashing in red mean that the viewer should find the corresponding number on their card (glow-in-the-dark for their convenience), and be ready to scratch-and-sniff when the on-screen number turns green.

Sadly, Paramount Home Video decided not to include the cards with the DVD release. So unless you got a card when the film was originally theatrically released, you're out of luck.

Here are the numbers, DVD time codes of when the numbers first appear on screen, and description of the scent.

1 - 05:31 - strawberry

2 - 11:42 - peanut butter

3 - 22:41 - a flower

4 - 39:05 - smelly feet

5 - 48:50 - root beer float

6 - 62:58 - fish

I've uploaded a small scan of the card to the Product Images section for this DVD, so feel free to take a look at it.",1115251200,7,1873,5.241610738255034
1916982,4,B0000CABL6,"I enjoy watching both ""The Rugrats"" and ""The Wild Thornberrys"".  I've seen both Rugrats movies and because of my work at a day care center and some babysitting, have seen ""The Wild Thornberrys Movie"" at least half a dozen times. Both shows are humorous and educational and have appeal not only for children, but to adults as well. I was really excited about the seeing RUGRATS GO WILD and how the filmmakers would bring the two different series together.  I think they did a fairly decent job.
The Rugrats gang is supposed to take a cruise, but Stew arranges for something a little different: a cruise on their own little ship. On the voyage they run into a tropical storm and eventually find themselves shipwrecked on an unpopulated island. Unbeknownst to them, Nigel Thornberry and his family is on the other side of the island, trying to capture a very rare cat on film. Nigel Thornberry happens to be Tommy's hero and Tommy believes that he has to be somewhere in the jungle.  He convinces the other kids and the Rugrat babies leave their side in the island and enter the jungle hoping to run into Nigel Thornberry. Surprisingly they do. However, Nigel gets bumped on the head and reverts to a childlike state.  Angelica meets up with Debbie and Donnie switches clothes with Chucky and chaos insues.
I really enjoyed watching RUGRATS GO WILD. I admit that parts of the movie might be frightening for younger children and the movie deals with some tougher issues that the two shows normally don't touch. Nevertheless, I thought the filmmakers did a wonderful job of bringing everyone together and uniting the two different worlds.  Younger children might be frightened by the storm or the wanderings of the babies in the jungle.  Some will be confused  by all the parallel story-lines.  However, older children and youth will probably enjoy the movie and all the different elements.  Adults will probably like it as well. I know I did.
The DVD includes a game, some scenes that were ""deleted"" (actually they were never finished), and an alternate ending.",1076630400,7,2057,4.804532577903683
