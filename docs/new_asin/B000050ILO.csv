2833105,5,B000050ILO,"One of the movies that are nice to keep.........all the venoms till the end..but one thing that always pounder in my thoughts.. Why? Why? The man with the 8 packs couldn't make it till the end.....Anyway the movie is different than most Kung Fu movies.... You would see the Hero who couldn't fight well without drinking and getting tipsy......If I were you I would watch it."" Shaw Brothers"" are a very good production Company.. peace..",1018915200,,435,4.8133333333333335
2833106,4,B000050ILO,"I really liked this movie. It had your typical venom plot. You never really know who's the good/bad guy til the end. Good action scences, especially the blade to arm fighting sequences with Golden Arm(that's right he uses his arms to block sword/weapons attacks) . Top Notch Venoms action. I recommend it.",1005782400,,305,4.884615384615385
2833107,4,B000050ILO,"While it may not be the best Venom flick (Unbeatable Dragon in my opinion) it sure is close. This is one of the venom movies where you see the entire crew  the Snake,lizard,toad ,centipede,Scorpion together again. My love for Kung-fu movies started with these guys ,then I graduated on to Movies with John Liu ,Hwang jang li ,Billy Chong and the Infamous Phillip Ko,though the movies with these gentlemen were faster and had more Kung fu styles,no one can top Shaw brothers movies when it comes to storylines and authenticity of Chinese culture. Some may say Mortal combat was these guys second best movie together ,but, I choose this one . Pick up a copy",1000339200,,655,4.695652173913044
2833108,3,B000050ILO,"ok so i seen most of the venoms movies,  this one is not a good one,  ""invincible shaolin"", ""killer army"" , ""flag of iron"", ""magnificent ruffians"", ""masked avengers"", and  ""crippled avengers"" (return of the five deadly venoms) are the best venoms movies available on here with good quality!!! five venoms starts off really good but then is boring after the first ten minutes and the only good thing about kid with the golden arm is philip kwok! (the lizard venom) the film sucks and is boring!  only buy it if your a shaw brothers collector!...",997833600,,544,4.6947368421052635
2833109,5,B000050ILO,"Considered by some kung fu classicists to be the Venom's best flick, EVEN better than the revered ""The Five Deadly Venoms,"" I still prefer the latter and consider ""Golden Arms"" a close second.  This excellent Venom film has long been one of the most sought after Venom flicks in the last 20 years.  No longer do classicists like myself have to rely on grainy re-dubs of a re-dub of a re-dub.  The print is of good quality.  The action is top-shelf and includes mythic like characters such as Silver Spear and Iron Robe with his Iron Fan technique.  Of all the newly released Venom flicks, this is at the top of the list.  Yet, again, I rank it just slightly below ""The 5 Deadly Venoms"" but superior to ""The Return of the 5 Deadly Venoms.""  The film is extremely high on style (and fashion) yet less fulfilling on substance and intrigue.  The final ""twist"" and ""surprise"" villian adds little, but we can easily overlook this.  This is a must buy!  In fact, the entire newly released ""Venom collection"" in my book is a must-buy, because you really can never go wrong with a Venom flick.",987033600,,1084,4.512820512820513

2833149,5,B000050ILO,"Saw this one as a kid. I love this movie. It is the inspiration behind the far less likeable ""Man with the Iron Fist"", starring Wu-Tang Clans's RZA. No disrespect, I love the RZA. If you like this I'd also suggest. ""Snake in the Eagles Shadow"", ""5 Deadly Venoms"" which is even better and has most of the same cast also a Shaw Bros. Production, ""Kung Fu Hustle"" & ""Thundering Mantis"". Enjoy:)",1483574400,2,391,4.444444444444445

8194815,1,B000050ILO,"This is one of the worst kung fu movies. No Story. A gang of four powerful fighters against other gangs and under cover officials, all fighting for a cart of gold. They set up boobie traps and everyone wants to kill everyone. In the end, two left standing and walks off with the gold. Waste of time. Fell asleep a few times and had to scroll forward to stay awake. Disappointed by all the so-called good reviews. Fight scenes are average with variety of weapons. Dubbed in English.",1499040000,,481,4.4772727272727275
8194816,5,B000050ILO,"It seems like everyone who knows a little bit of kung fu movies have seen this & rightfully so. This is probably the 3rd most recognizable films of the entire genre ranking right behind 5 (Deadly) Venoms & King Boxer (otherwise known in the US as 5 Fingers of Death). Of course I'm excluding the Bruce Lee catalog of movies which speaks for themselves.

The movie is about a shipment of gold needed to help the famine area. Famed swordsman Yang Hu Yun (Sun Chien) is in charge of its safe passage there. Assisting him is Long Axe (Shu Pei Sun) & Short Axe (Chiang Sheng), another famous swordsman LI Chin Ming (Wei Pai) & his girlfriend (Pan Pin Chang) & the wine-drinking magnificent Agent Hai To (Kuo Choi). Of course there's a group of bandits called the Chi Sau Gang who are trying to get their hands on the gold at any cost. The gang is led by Golden Arm (Lo Mang) & members also include Silver Spear (Lu Feng), Iron Robe (Wang Lung Wei) & Brass Head (Yang Hsiung).

A lot of booby traps & trickery ensued as well as some fine martial arts skills. I thought everyone for the most part was on par, especially Lo Mang & Kuo Choi. Wei Pai's part was a little weak, but he played the role of a proud egotistical swordsman very well. When you have a lot of good action & just enough humor in it, you have a definite classic on your hand & that's what director Chang Cheh has here. If you're one of the few humans who haven't witnessed this film for yourself (either as a newbie fan or not), go view it & prepare to be hooked for life!",1493251200,4,1534,4.2320819112627985
