7599136,4,B01AD981SU,A different kind of cops' & robbers'  series.,1502323200,,45,4.625
7599137,5,B01AD981SU,This is a great series! Set in the Shetland Isles. Series 1 &2 are based on books by Ann Cleeves and series 3 is an original story by the writers. It is well acted and the stories are gripping. The scenery is stunning and the music is beautiful. I recommend this series to anyone interested in great crime drama. I have watched the stories several times and I find something new every time I watch. It is better than anything we have on American TV.,1498780800,,449,4.294117647058823
7599138,5,B01AD981SU,Loved this series and can't wait for the next series.,1495324800,,53,4.4
7599139,5,B01AD981SU,"Ruggedly ravenous. The scenic islands of Shetland are to die for, such beauty to behold. The accents will make you fall in love with these Scots from the opening scenes. The music is enchanting, a sojourn all by itself. It is a poetic enticing series and thena body, a murder, or something terrible breaks the idyllic scene. DI Perez (Douglas Henshall) heads up the island investigations with his assistance coming from Wilson (Steven Robertson), and daughter/cop Alison (Alison ODonnell- yes, she plays a role with her real given name) and who eventually gets caught up in terrible circumstances which becomes yet another mystery plot.
Best TV Drama of Scotland in 2016, also nominated in 2015. Henshaw won Best TV Actor too. Guest stars include Archie Panjabi (The Good Wife) & Julie Graham (Bletchley Circle) in two series with the role of Rhona Kelly; I love her performance.

Created from Ann Cleeves crime novels. It is captivating hours and hours of crime mystery viewing. Youll be glad you own the DVDs.
SDH SUBTITLES in English for those needing them for hearing loss and the delightful but hearty accents.

Make sure you have the correct DVD player for this set. It's not America's Region One. 1-3 should be out for that region eventually.",1485648000,,1249,4.914691943127962
7599140,1,B01AD981SU,In my ignorance I did not know UK DVDs were of a different format and incompatible with US players.,1482451200,,99,4.2631578947368425
7599141,5,B01AD981SU,"DVD is for ""region 2"" so I am forced to watch on my laptop.... BUT..... I still run via cable to the big screen TV.
Series 3 is a 6 part single story. Actual character development  without the usual rush.. I hope there is more to come.
Beautiful scenery. again great characters, good involved plot....Perfect??? probably not..... but compared to the choices on US  television...outstanding

remember this seller only has ""region 2 DVDs, but there are ways to convert to USA format",1475193600,5,480,4.829268292682927
7599142,5,B01AD981SU,DVD arrived before the estimated date. Also brilliant detective series.,1470873600,2,71,6.2
7599143,5,B01AD981SU,Very good met my expectations.  Still have a few episodes to watch,1468627200,,66,4.5
7599144,4,B01AD981SU,"If you have the original 2-DVD of Shetland, be aware that this version, marketed as Shetland the Complete Series 1-3 does not mean you will get 3x as much excellent contents: the marketers have taken the liberty to calll the original Shetland now Series 1 and 2, adding a 6-part storie based on Ann Cleaves' characters calling it Series 3.
Yes, I should have read the description more carefullybut I was so exited at the prospect of 3x as much as I already had that I didn't realise it until I put the first DVD in my player.
Series 3 is one 6-part story, with the same main characters in a twisting and turning plot. It would have been a 5-star rating if not for ...",1463270400,13,667,4.301587301587301
8747114,5,B01AD981SU,"I loved it. The BBC does murder mysteries so well. A bit like Hinterland, but holds its own very well.",1531526400,,102,4.15
8747115,5,B01AD981SU,This is the first three seasons and they are all terrific. Just got Season 4 as well and it continues to enthrall.,1526169600,,114,4.2272727272727275
8747116,5,B01AD981SU,"I loved it so much I bought Season 4.  David Henshall plays DCI Perez as a mature, measured, fair and competent detective.  But, he is no one to be deceived.  I did not enjoy the first ep. much, but this does get better as it goes along.  The last being 6 episodes of one story line with Sara Vickers of the Endeavour series as guest.

My only problem with the character(s) was with one.  I did not find his DS Alison McIntosh (played by Alison O'Donnell) to be very believable.  Too young to have been a DS.  For every theory she came up with, every thing that she put together or solved was so scripted just for her.  In other words, she did not play the character as confident, experienced and believable.  She was the only flaw.

I still give it 5 stars because of the excellent work by the other actors, particularly David Henshall.  Of course, there is the obligatory story line, which never goes anywhere until the child character (or co-parent) is soon written out.  And that is the single parent raising a child alone. In this case he is a single step parent whose attempts to parent are obstructed by the biological father who is now back in the picture.

But the story lines are well developed and David Henshall is entirely believable.  I love these discoveries because with each series in which a character and the actory he/she plays impresses me, I go out and find other movies and series and so on.  Quite different from the Detective Shows we have in the U.S.  We have had a few good ones over the years, but in the UK there is a steady wealth of them.",1523145600,,1569,4.373702422145329
8747117,5,B01AD981SU,"If this DVD doesn't play on US equipment, do buy it on the version that does. This is a very fine series on a variety of levels.

The first exquisite element is where it is filmed, which figures in this with as much importance as the incredible actors and the fine writing. The scenery is particularly enchanting to someone who has never visited Scotland. Between this program and Outlander, it is truly moving to me.
I also find the lilt of the language another source of charm. We don't hear a Scottish accent very often in film or television.

The work of Douglas Henshall is superb, understated and memorable. I can't think of a more appealing actor doing work in this genre.

The absence of weapons is another striking feature. The overall haunting, still, sense of place is not interrupted by guns or harsh language.

The other actors are outstanding, with well written personalities that also don't overload the overall tone.

This series is so worth your time. I truly hope that it is recognized for the wonderful, satisfying, thoughtful product which I have treasured.",1520726400,,1077,4.8
8747118,1,B01AD981SU,I love this series & was sooo disappointed to receive this only to discover it doesn't play in standard American DVD players. I'm returning tomorrow.,1519603200,,149,5.0

8747121,5,B01AD981SU,Terrific stories & acting. Beautiful scenery.  Only drawback is you really need to pay attention because the brogue is pretty thick from all the actors.,1516406400,,152,5.08
