7809588,5,6301063244,I need to digitize this before my VHS goes out.  Great quality being a used tape.  Glad I bought it.,1403740800,2,100,3.95
7809589,5,6301063244,I love this old movie but the people selling this item are over pricing it. I just bought it on ebay for a little over $6. I don't know what these people are thinking selling a VHS at over $25. That's crazy!!!,1324425600,,209,4.0
7809590,5,6301063244,"My kids watched this video repeatedly in the 80's,and bemoaned not having it now for their own children.  I purchased this for my daughter's birthday, hoping it was the correct one, and YEA! it was.

She is delighted with it, both because it is the one she remembered from childhood, and because it's in such good condition. The seller marked it as ""very good""condition, and it is. My son had purchased one several years ago from E-Bay, and it was not nearly as good.

Thanks for making a memorable birthday surprise possible!",1300838400,,526,4.695652173913044
