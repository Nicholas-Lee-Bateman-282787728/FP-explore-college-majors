6463266,3,B00L22H2TM,"""Until recently you only had to die once in this city, even if you came from God's Pocket."" Mickey Scarpato (Hoffman) is the step-father to a kid that no one in the city really likes. The son gets killed at work one day but no one will tell the truth about what happened. This doesn't bother Mickey and he is ready to bury him right away but his wife and the boys mother demands the truth. Mickey does what he can to find out what happened but between finding out the truth, trying to make his wife happy and finding a way to pay for the funeral things begin to pile on top of him. When his wife turns to news reporter Richard Shellburn (Jenkins) for additional help things really begin to spiral out of control. This is a tough movie to review. I did think the movie was good and tense but did move very slow and was hard to stay focused on. The acting was great and this was very realistic but again though the pacing made it hard to stay engrossed in. Hoffman did a great job of playing someone who seemed lost and under an immense amount of stress and Jenkins was great as a sleazy reporter. The number one reason to watch this is for the acting. The movie itself, again, is pretty good but it is one you have to be in the mood for otherwise it will be a struggle to make it through. Overall, a movie that is worth seeing if you are in the mind set for it. It's too bad that Hoffman died because he is great in roles like this. I give it a B-.",1410048000,4,1447,4.062937062937063
6463267,4,B00L22H2TM,"""God's Pocket"" (2014 release; 90 min.) brings the story of a fictitious working-class neighborhood in Philadelphia called God's Pocket. As the movie opens, we see people gather for a funeral but we really don't know whose funeral or who is who. Then the screen announces ""Three Days Earlier' and we get to know Mickey and Jeanie Scarpato (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Christina Hendricks, respectively) and Jeanie's son from an earlier marriage Keon. Turns out Leon is a jerk and a bully and when he threatens a old black guy at work, the black guys ends up knocking him off with a baseball bat. When the police arrive, everyone says it was an unfortunate construction accident. Jeanie doesn't buy it. Meanwhile Mickey has to figure out a way to pay for the funeral. In a parallel story, we get to know Richard Shellburn (played by Richard Jenkins), an aging (and alcoholic) columnist for the Daily Times. At this point we are barely 20 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the directing debut of actor John Slattery (a/k/a Roger Sterling in Mad Men). The film is an adaptation of the early 1980s book of the same name by Peter Dexter. Co-writers Slattery and Alex Metcalf decided to keep the late 70s/early 80s setting, which only adds to the gritty atmosphere in the movie. The movie is decidedly downbeat as pretty much everyone struggles with one serious problem or another. The acting performances are what carry this movie, though. Yes, there is Philip Seymour Hoffman in one of his last roles, but frankly there are other performances who are even more impressive: first there is John Turturro (as Mickey's co-worker and friend), whom we just recently also saw in ""Fading Gigolo"", and then there is Richard Jenkins, who in my opinion simply steals the movie as the alcoholic but still beloved columnist for the Daily Times. I saw him last Fall also shine in another little indie movie ""A.C.O.D."". Bottom line: this isn't the type of movie where you walk out of the theater thinking 'that was a jolly good time!"", but even with that, I was surprised how quickly the movie flew by, so in that sense I very much enjoyed the movie.

""God's Pocket"" opened last month without any pre-release hype or advertising at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati and I figured this wouldn't not play very long so I went to see it right away. The matinee screening I saw this at was not very well attended, and I can't say that surprises me, giving the rather downbeat tone of the movie. That said, if you are in the mood for some fine character studies and correlating great acting performances, I would readily recommend ""God's Pocket"" to you, be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1402963200,23,2820,4.694949494949495

6463275,3,B00L22H2TM,"Set in a fictitious area of Philadelphia, GOD'S POCKET is the story of a down-at-heel area whose inhabitants struggle to make a living.  Mickey Scarpato (Philip Seymour Hoffman) delivers meat and does little ""jobs"" on the side, aided and abetted by Arthur (John Turturro), who also runs a flower-shop with his wife.  Mickey, married to Jeanie (Christina Hendricks), suffers a bereavement when Jeanie's son Leon (Caleb Landry Jones) meets a violent end at work, even though everyone protests it was an accident.  Campaigning journalist Richard Shellburn (Richard Jenkins) of the local paper decides to investigate the case, but becomes far more interested in Jeanie than his work.

Structurally speaking, John Slattery's debut feature contains strong echoes of PULP FICTION insofar as it portrays a world where random things happen and characters have very little control over events.  Mickey tries to arrange an expensive funeral for Leon, but owing to a series of comic events - as well as his own gambling losses - he ends up with Leon's corpse in his butcher's van.  The local newspaper subsequently reports that Leon has died twice.  Arthur's flower-shop is menaced by two toughs out for revenge, but they are unexpectedly shot by his elderly wife who happens to keep a loaded shotgun on the premises for safety.  Meanwhile Richard ends up writing a typically rhetorical piece on God's Pocket for his weekly column, and ends up getting beaten up by the local residents for his pains.  No one, it seems, has control over their lives - which helps to explain why many residents seek solace in a seedy neighborhood bar at all times of the day.

The film starts slowly: much of the dialog is indistinct, and punctuated with imprecations.  Yet this is part of the film's point; in an area such as this verbal communication doesn't really matter.  All the locals are out for what they can get, and are prepared to resort to violence and trickery to achieve their ends.  Seymour Hoffman's Mickey comes across as a fundamentally unsympathetic personality, more interested in his gambling than his family.

In the end Mickey leaves with Arthur for an unspecified, if idyllic location.  They have no further use for God's Pocket.  Yet even while they enjoy the benefits of their motor-caravan, Arthur is still taken off for a lesson in markspersonship by his wife.  Violence, it seems, is endemic to this society, and everyone needs to protect themselves in whatever way they can.",1440288000,,2474,4.995121951219512
6463276,4,B00L22H2TM,"For some it is a comedy you may want to watch over and over. I would call it a dark comedy about a man who is trying to please his wife but cannot. This does not have anything to do with the sexual scenes, which there are a few, and nudity. Not the type of movie to watch when kids are around. Some violence and language. One of Hoffman's best works. But I failed to see what the message was unless it was to depict what goes on in every day life in urban cultures.",1436659200,,465,3.905263157894737

6463293,4,B00L22H2TM,"This film could have been called God's children, or Divine creations. It is about a segment of humanity, a very pitiful segment of under-educated lower-class citizens in run-down Philadelphia, people with little money and much debt, people who can hear a compliment and think they have been insulted, people who spend too much time in the local bar.
It starts when Hoffmans somewhat deranged step-son threatens an old black man at a construction site with a knife and the black man kills him. His fellow workers decide to protect the black man and claim the step-son died in an accident when something fell on his head. Hoffmans wife feels certain, without any evidence that this claim is a lie. She sets three investigations in motion: the police, her husbands gangster friends, and a local celebrity newspaper writer who develops the hots for her a moment after seeing her.  The step-son is taken to the funeral home. But when Hoffman tells the funeral director that he cant pay just now because he lost the money his friends collected to help him pay for the funeral betting on horses, but promises to pay in a month, the director places the body outside his building in the alley, in the rain.
Matters grow worse. The gangsters want Hoffmans friend to pay the thousands of dollars they owe him. The gangsters men are hurt badly when they confront the construction foreman trying to find how the step-son died and he wants revenge. The reporter seduces Hoffmans wife.",1418774400,2,1470,4.810276679841897

6463296,4,B00L22H2TM,"God's Pocket (2014) is an all American movie, that takes place in a small American town and is full of awkward, borderline criminals/hustlers, characters.  It is one of those well made and produced American quirky indies similar in fashion to movies like: Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007), Burn After Reading (2008), The Savages (2007), or Killing Them Softly (2012).

MDB rates this film at 6.1 stars, which I find unfair.  In my honest opinion, American cinema would have been dead long time ago if it was not for these particular independent productions that never really hit the mainstream theaters, because majority of people in America (or even abroad for that matter) don't care for independent movies, which normally are not that ""entertaining"" to a common person.  People want fireworks, non-stop action, quick resolutions, happy endings, simplistic dialogues, etc.

God's Pocket is a very-dark drama/comedy.  The movie revolves around at least three characters and their problems.  The problems they face are somewhat common (like owing a large sum of money to gangsters) and also somewhat uncommon (like keeping a dead body of a step-son in a refrigerated truck)...

It is hard to say what  the movie is about. All I can say about the plot is that it is based on ""real-and-not-so-real"" life problems while living in a small town where everyone knows everyone else's personal life and more...

Hoffman as always is really good at playing his arch-typical loser character. Too bad he passed away.",1416009600,,1514,5.093117408906883

6463299,4,B00L22H2TM,"""God's Pocket"" completely snuck up on me.  I didn't know that this movie was made so I wasn't even anticipating its release, it turned up quite by surprise. I was trying to think how I could describe this movie; it's dark, dank, aloof, and in crucial spots, laughably quirky. While the story itself is many things, it will be different for many. For me, it was darkly comedic and may even polarize its own audience with its bleak character studies and its getting-nowhere-quickly results. I still found it quite good even though I had to grapple quite hard to feel any vested emotion for anyone of the characters here in a dilapidated looking, God's Pocket.

Set in a small hamlet of South Philly is this small neighborhood with a purely broken feel. The people inhabiting it are seemingly apathetic, or just plain flat-affected blue-collar workers who spend most of their time in the local bars. They drag themselves inside after a day of scamming, scheming or just plain hard work. Along with the other broken backs is Mickey Scarpato (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who probably bought his own seat bellied up to the bar. He is now having a personal dilemma concerning his wife, Jeanie's (Christina Hendricks), adult son.  Leon (Caleb Landry Jones) is one bad apple from another marriage and has been killed in a construction accident at his workplace right away. The entire situation concerning his death then burial is questionable, sometimes laughable, as Leon was not a good guy and certainly nobody even cares that he is gone.  His mother Jeanie cannot leave it alone.  She believes something is not square and someone is not telling the truth about it.  Mickey must find a way to pay off his debt, pay for the funeral and keep everything together (including Jeanie) in his flimflammer's style. As soon as you see John Turturro ('Bird') showing up as Mickeys buddy, you are reassured of the confidence man's role in this lowborn feeling drama.

Along with Mickey's story are the parallel concerns of Richard Shellburn (Richard Jenkins) who has been tipped off by Jeanie and is now digging around for the real scoop. He is a columnist that has been writing about this area continually in his life, although now he is just a washed-up drunk and womanizing most of the time.  Everywhere you look in this movie; you will find and feel the apathy of the players who actually make the story quite interesting in spite of themselves.  Directed by John Slattery who gives the movie a realistic and heavy-handed focus on its gritty atmosphere and lost looking landscapes (Lance Acord).  The broken-down cars line the streets while trash cans sit awaiting garbage day as Mickey shuffles through the neighborhood trying to find his way back home in God's Pocket.",1415318400,4,2752,4.848614072494669

6463303,5,B00L22H2TM,"Realism in the Pocket. John Slattery manages to achieve a gritty realism in this Pete Dexter adaptation from the novel of the same name. God's Pocket, an area in South Philly, where people are born, work, drink, and die. Some are lucky and get out early. What the film achieves is a certain reality that only exists in documentary where fiction takes a back seat to the warts and all thing called living, or in this case dying. There are no certainties in life; only, we are born, then we die. In between, it's how you fill your time. Some people, people in the Pocket, are not given much choice because the environment eats them up. Environment in the film, as well as the seemingly cast of surrounding non-actors gives this film so much authenticity. The actors we know, Hoffman, in one of his last roles, Turturro, Marsan, Hendricks, and Richard Jenkins are just subtle enough to blend into this environment. They're worn, tired, and running out of options. It's fight or flight, and a lot of sitting on the barstool. That's it, and all the stuff in between. As a film piece, this reminded me of Bukowski, ""Titicut Follies,"" and parts of Rocky, without the boxing. The source material is not without merit, strength, experience, and the autobiographical beating Pete Dexter did take WITH baseball bats. Incredible film with masterful acting, setting, realism, and a solid directorial debut. The reviews are wrong on this; don't judge the film just because it's not a superhero movie or because Channing Tatum isn't in it. Rent it. Buy it. RIP P.S.H.",1413590400,4,1552,4.773234200743494

6463306,4,B00L22H2TM,"Philadelphia is a city defined by it's diverse neighborhoods and Gray's Ferry is one of the more colorful.  Gray's Ferry is an enclave in South Philly populated by mostly Irish-Catholic tradesmen who work and live hard during the week and stumble into Mass on Sunday morning.  In the Seventies and Eighties newspaper scribe Pete Dexter wrote columns championing these everyday heroes and loosely based his first novel on Gray's Ferry which this film derives its inspiration.  As gritty a work director John Slattery's film is I think he overdid it in the grit department.  These are proud people and they wouldn't let their neighborhood deteriorate like that.  Also, Yonkers where this movie was filmed makes a poor substitute for South Philly.  The writer character played by Richard Jenkins was an annoyance and superfluous.  He was probably in Dexter's book but he is totally extraneous.  I wonder if Dexter is engaging in a little self aggrandizement or taking potshots at the fifth estate with this character.  For nothing else see this film for another brilliant performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman as the slow on the intake Mickey who has the unenviable task of burying his psychotic stepson who was killed in a mysterious construction site accident.  The look on Hoffman's face as he and the stepson's corpse are thrown out in the rain by the funeral director after Mickey lost the deposit for the kid's funeral at the track is priceless.  Hoffman ambles around with that hangdog defeated look that is as much pathetic as humorous.  John Turturro as Hoffman's florist buddy Virgil is almost equally good.  Enough of the wit from Dexter's source novel has been retained to give ""God's Pocket"" my recommendation.  On a side note Dexter would later win the National Book Award for ""Paris Trout"" which was made into a movie starring Dennis Hopper.",1410480000,6,1853,4.993485342019544
