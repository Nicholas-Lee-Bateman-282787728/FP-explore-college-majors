5743514,4,B00CWM7EPS,"With a name like ""Epic"", it has to be big, or at least it should be. I was only afraid that ""Epic"" would be the Michael Bay of animated movies. Following ""Iron Man 3"" and ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" in its release date and opening the same week of ""The Hangover 3"" and ""Fast and Furious 6"", it is certainly up against big competition. Fortunately, that wasn't what I saw. What I saw was an adventure of thought-provoking depth that did exactly what I love most in movies; it took me to another world and kept me there until the credits rolled.

Mary Katherine or M.K. (Amanda Seyfried) is a character who has a distant relationship with her father and is still feeling the effects of the death of her mother. Her father has been buried in his research and there is a lot of animosity between them. He is convinced that there is a tiny culture of beings inhabiting the forest that surrounds their home. There are some deep subjects in the movie that may go over some children's heads, as well as some non-charismatic moments from Collin Farrell's Character, Ronin, which may bore you and your child to death.

Honestly though, I liked that there was some complexity to it. While the movie incorporated the things that have made other Blue Sky Studios movies (""Ice Age"", ""Rio"" & ""Robots"") hits with all ages, it also had a depth and imagination to it that reminded me of movies like ""The Dark Crystal"", ""Labyrinth"" and ""The Never Ending Story"".

It is easy to say that ""Epic"" is possibly one of the most beautifully animated 3D movies I've seen to date. Again, the 3D adds to the, dare I say, epicness of the film. Nestled in the yards and woods is an epic world of Leafmen and Boggans that control the life and death of nature as we know it. The 3-dimensional world comes to life as we explore a world on the backs of hummingbirds and see streams, trees, springs and tunnels up close.

There's a little something missing with ""Epic"" though. There's almost a dryness that leaves some of the emotions flat and never truly capitalizes on the urgency we should feel as an audience. It wasn't hard connecting with M.K. but she too easily adapts to the task she is given and despite not knowing how she will return to normal life, she seems to go ahead without emotion; fear, joy or anything otherwise. That being said, the slug and snail characters added much needed comic relief.

I do recommend ""Epic"" because I enjoyed myself. Although if the writers had spent less time hammering home the nuts and bolts of the miniature world culture, which we understood in the first twenty minutes of the film, they could have spent more time making a better ending to the film and fleshing out some true and more widespread emotion. It could have been a better film, but that's not saying it wasn't more entertaining than most of the stuff out there these days.",1369612800,85,2845,4.538011695906433
5743515,4,B00CWM7EPS,"This review is based on going to see ""Epic"" in the cinema with my family.

""Epic"" is a beautifully created animated family film based on William Joyce's book ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Leaf-Men-and-the-Brave-Good-Bugs-Harper-Trophy-Books/dp/0064438171/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs (Harper Trophy Books)</a>. It is rather like a better execution of the same basic idea as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arthur-The-Invisibles/dp/B00443FMZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arthur & The Invisibles</a>"" except that in this case the whole film is animated where ""Arthur and the invisibles"" had the human-size portions played by real actors and the miniature sections animated. Ironically that means that, this film having a star studded voice cast, several of whom are extremely easy on the eye, the film does not show them as they usually appear: but the characters are so beautifully drawn that you don't really mind.

Case in point: the heroine and central character, Mary Katherine (who prefers to be known as MK) is voiced by actress Amanda Seyfried and the queen of the forest, Queen Tara, is voiced by Beyonce Knowles. I imagine one or two dads would much prefer to have seen the ladies concerned rather than animated images for which they provided the voices. But that reaction won't have lasted more than a few seconds after seeing how well their characters were voiced and drawn. Christian Kaplan who did the casting for this film obviously did pick the cast for their voices rather than their appearance, they more than justify the choice.

MK is a teenage girl whose mother has recently died. At the start of the film she arrives at the semi-derelict house, on the edge of a forest, where her father, mad scientist Professor Bomba (Jason Sudeikis) lives and studies the fauna of the forest. Bomba had wrecked both his career and his marriage through his obsessive attempts to prove that an ""advanced civilisation"" of tiny people exists in the forest.

It probably won't be a spoiler to anyone thinking of going to see this film - certainly not to anyone who has seen the trailer - that Bomba's apparently preposterous theory, which no other human takes seriously, is in fact correct. Nor that his daughter finds herself magically shrunk to the same size as the tiny denizens of the forest - and caught up in the constant war between two factions of forest creatures.

Although some of the less intelligent promotional material for this film presents that conflict as a battle between good and evil - and I have seen it wrongly suggested that the battle in the forest might also affect our world as well - the actual presentation in the film is a lot more nuanced than this. One side, led by Queen Tara (Beyonce Knowles) and her ""leaf men"" soldiers, represents growth, the other led by Mandrake (Christoph Waltz) and his ""boggan"" troops represent decay. Children or anyone else who wants to take a simple moral from the film will see Queen Tara's side as representing good while Mandrake is evil, but adults will realise that the life of the forest would actually depend on a balance between the two.

Indeed, one of the best things about the film is that the ""bad guy,"" Mandrake, is not cartoonishly and two-dimensionally evil. Like the most dangerous villains in the real world or the best literature Mandrake is all the more formidable as an opponent because he has characteristics which in a ""good guy"" would be recognised as virtues. Instead of going down the all-too-familiar route of presenting the villain as being pathetic, cowardly, and full of hatred even to those closest to him, the film gives Mandrake a lot of the best lines, shows both him and his son and general Dagda (Blake Anderson) leading from the front at various stages of the film, and doesn't show them constantly plotting to betray each other.

Other strong and well voiced characters which enrich the film include Ronin (Colin Farrell) the general of the Leaf men, Nod  (Josh Hutcherson), an independent minded young leafman whose dead father had been Ronin's friend, a pair of sometimes charming and sometimes aggravating molluscs,  Mub the slug (Aziz Ansari) and  Grub the snail (Chris O'Dowd), and a glow-worm impresario called Nim Galuu (Steven Tyler) who is also the keeper of the magic scrolls which record everything which goes on in the forest. The film also features the rapper Armando Prez, better known by his stage name Pitbull, voicing a frog mafia boss.

Every time I go to see a new animated film I think the depiction of the characters, scenery and events could not get any more beautifully done, and every time you get to the next one you realise you were wrong, and this film is yet another visual feast. The plotting is also reasonably tight, keeping your attention, there are plenty of simple jokes for the kids and more sophisticated ones for the adults. It had me laughing at the jokes quite a few times.

Not everyone will like this film - some people will see it as far too similar to ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" and others will consider it a bit twee and childish. But I would consider it a very good film for children up to the age of about thirteen - my eleven-year-old daughter certainly loved it - and which adults can enjoy with their kids.",1369612800,72,5372,5.016835016835016
5743516,3,B00CWM7EPS,"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the Sherlock Holmes franchise, was convinced that five photos taken by Elise Wright and Frances Griffiths were pictures of genuine fairies. They later admitted that the whole thing was a hoax. That's the modern-day premise of ""Epic,"" in which Professor Bomba (Jason Sudeikis) has dedicated his life's work - to the exclusion of his family - to proving the existence of fairies.  His theory is that we can't see these fairies because they move out of phase, faster than us (or alternately, we're slower than them).  And so Bomba's estranged daughter, Mary Katherine (Amanda Seyfried) has come home to live with her father.

If the fairies weren't real this would be a very short film, so it's not a spoiler to say that they exist. There's a dizzying variety, embodied primarily by two sides; the Leafmen led by Queen Tara (Beyonce Knowles) represent the forces of life and the Boggans led by Mandrake (Christopher Waltz) represent the forces of death.  A special day is nigh: the summer solstice coincides with a full moon, which is the time Queen Tara chooses a successor by passing on a magic pod that will bloom according to its circumstances.  If it grows in the light of the full moon it will empower the darkness, which of course encourages the Boggans to commit a full scale assault.

Somewhere along the way, Mary Katherine (MK for short) shrinks down, randomly inserted Nod (Josh Hutcherson) rebels against the more serious Ronin (Colin Farrell), and snail Grub (Chris O'Dowd) and slug Mub (Aziz Ansari) perform a recurring comedy skit.  MK carries most of the film, with the other characters in orbit around her with their throwaway plots (Nod lost his dad and resents Ronin's paternal stance towards him, Mub wants to be a Leafman, Grub has a crush on MK).  But mostly ""Epic"" is a series of epic fight scenes between elf-like leaf warriors and orc-like goblins.

""Epic"" does 3D very well. The fight scenes are energetic and the stakes are high; when villains fall off their mount they fall to their death - the film doesn't shy away from this, smearing one Boggan on a windshield - and the action clicks along at a frenetic pace.  But when you strip away the novelty of big vs. little, tree vs. fungus people, ""Epic"" is basically like every other action fantasy film.

This doesn't make ""Epic"" bad, but it's not particularly kid-friendly either.  It's pretty to look at, but up close, it's not nearly as exciting as you might have hoped. My son got bored about halfway through.",1369526400,23,2522,4.772413793103448
5743517,5,B00CWM7EPS,"Simply put:  The animation was beyond beautiful.  It was seriously a good, clean, fun and all around awesome family movie.  I can't think of anything bad about it.",1369526400,66,163,4.75
5743518,4,B00CWM7EPS,"Okay, this film took a while to make and to write because Tom J. Astle, Matt Ember, James V. Hart, and Daniel Shere took a wonderful children novel by William Joyce called `The Leaf Man and the Brave Good Bugs', and turned this film into a magnificently looking film adventure with a very big heart.

Director Chris Wedge, (Robots, Ice Age -and he is the voice of Scrat in the Ice Age features and shorts) took his time and fined tuned the story and action to make you understand what is important to each of us. Family and your friends are defiantly something worth cultivating because in the long run, we cannot survive without them.

Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games, The Kids Are Alright) voices Nod, a more than independent young man who doesn't like to follow the rules. Trying to be mentored by a sincerely honest and often frustrated Collin Farrell (Phone Booth, Total Recall) as Ronin, the leader of the planet and tree warriors trying to do his best to show Nod what good decisions can lead to as he defends the forest from rot.

Enter a disconnected father and daughter, Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia!, Les Miserables) playing Mary Katherine or M.K. and Jason Sudeikis (Horrible Bosses, The Campaign) playing Bomba her father, who just can't seem to connect with each other on any level. Her decision to move away from her father changes as she learns a valuable lesson.

Now dad's mission is to prove that the forest is cultivated, developed and designed by small forest people who maintain the balance of beauty, life and growth in the woods. His daughter more than skeptical, ventures out and on her way of distracting herself becomes involved in a really fun magical adventure.

Queen Tara, queen of the forest and all its magic and beauty, is voiced by Beyonce Knowles (Obsessed, Cadillac Records) - is taunted by the ever evil rot of the forest Mandrake who is voiced by Christoph Waltz (Django, Water for Elephants) ,who only wants everything dead and covered with mold and rot. Cruel and vicious is mandrake while Queen Tara finds an unsuspecting hero in an unsuspecting place.

Without saying much more, the bad guys do some serious damage to life and the forest overall and it's an unexpected and surprising source that good barely wins over evil, but you have to see how it all happens for yourself!  There some amazing and funny voices that will have you laughing out loud like Steven Tyler (Polar Express) as Nim Galuu a caterpillar with an attitude; two hysterical buddy's, Aziz Ansari (Parks and Recreation, Ice Age) as Mub a snail and Chris O'Dowd (Brides Maids, Monsters Vs. Aliens) as Grub a slug, who reminded me of Laurel and Hardy in a small way.

This movie has lots of action, tons of comedy and more importantly a wonderful message about the importance of family and friends. Doing the right thing for the right reasons can only lead to success, happiness, fulfilling your goals and of course, love. This is a must see for the entire family and definitely something that will ultimately make you feel good when you leave the theatre! Enjoy this one!",1369180800,13,3082,4.726256983240224

Tonight I searched for a movie that would cause us to laugh and yet have enough suspense and drama to hold our attention.  My family is large (12 children) with a wide age spread (20 months to 25 years) and very few movies have had the ability to keep us in our seats like this one did.  A great mixture of adventure/drama and humor.  Yes, there were a few scenes that were intense for the 3-5 year old group (three of them there) that caused them to huddle under big sisters and brothers arms for comfort, but they were soon smiling and engaged again.  As the credits rolled the response was, ""we didn't even think about stopping for our ice cream,"" a usual practice on Friday nights here.

5743556,5,B00CWM7EPS,"With a resume as ""from the creators of Ice Age and Rio"", I honestly did not expect much out of this film.  I mean, considering the more serious nature of the subject matter, listing down comedic and light hearted films like Ice Age and Rio doesn't spark much confidence.  But you know...in this instance, they really knew what they were doing and managed to tell a tale of truly ""Epic"" proportions...and besides, how often do you get to have believable Irish Samurai running around?

CONTENT ISSUES:
First things first, ultimately, I did not find anything particularly offensive.  The rating even mentioned ""brief rude language"", but honestly I did not even hear any such language.  I guess that means it was either non-existant or very, very, very, very brief.  No innuendos,  no foul language, no blatant sex, etc.  The only thing I would take note of is that this takes place during a war.  There are epic battle scenes and several skirmishes...and sometimes people do die.  However, in these particular deaths, it's not especially graphic...for example, one guy takes an arrow a few characters take arrows and fall off their mounts...of which only one once do you really see an arrow sticking out of a person (which is an important plot point).  Also, the boggin are the people of the rot...so they have the ability to rot the forest...in manifests itself in several ways such as rotting plants and whatnot.  But there is one instance where the Lord of the Rot (not his real in-film title, but it's a better descriptor) rots a bat one of the leafmen (protagonists) is riding in pursuit of him.  You don't see the transformation/progression of the rot, but you do see the result where the bat has rotted down to a skeleton (clean bones...no residual muscles/tissue).

THE FILM (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):
The Comedy:
Normally, I would start these overviews by looking at the plot/themes.  But I think this is where we need to begin for this instance.  You see, as alluded to before, the fact that they mentioned that this was from the creators of Ice Age and Rio led me to believe that this would be more of a comedic and/or light hearted film. Even the synopsis in the back of the DVD makes it a point to claim that this film is ""the year's funniest, most exhilarating animated adventure!""  Couple that with comedic looking slugs, you can't help but get that comedic sense out of it.  BUT HERE'S THE THING...this film was more so a drama with very few slight comedic elements sprinkled in to lighten an otherwise dark and desperate situation.  And in most cases, the humor was found in smart one liners and situation wit rather than slapstick.  So, honestly, I feel like the person that wrote those opening lines in the DVD did not even watch the film but just made some assumptions based on WHO was working on this project.

The Story:
The biggest surprise for me was in how grand and cohesive the story was.  After watching the film, you understand why they named the film ""Epic"", because that was precisely what they were aiming form.  If you're one who's read many books and seen many films, the general plot will not be anything new.  But for me, I don't watch films or read books for ""something new"".  In the end, anything becomes ""old"" after experiencing it once.  The reason I watch films, in terms of storyline, is simply because I enjoy the story...and you can find that in this film.

This is a story that has multiple plot lines running through it at the same time.  On the one hand, you have M.K. who is a girl that feels very alone in large part due to parental separation. Being forced (implied) to spend time with her estranged Dad who seems to be a crazy, obsessed nitwit.  You have the mini subplot of the Dad, as well, as you discover the cause of his current obsession.  You have, Nod, a rookie soldier who is a free-spirit and often goes against his surrogate father.  You also have the grander plot of the war between the forces of the living forest and the forces of the rot.  The storylines are told very well...and what's more, they were surprisingly intertwined around the theme of many leaves, but one tree...or in lay-speak ""you are never truly alone"".  The progression was well-paced and surprisingly very cohesive and smooth.  The film covers a lot of ground, but it feels natural and not rushed.

An interesting comparison that has been made is that it's a 3D Ferngully.  To be honest, though, I would not make such a correlation.  Thematically, I see no real connection as it's not a battle between man and nature, but against the living and the dead (or rot, as it were)...very much a straight light versus dark situation.

The Art and World:
One of the obvious strong points in this film is the art direction and environment.  First off, the environment does feel like a living and breathing world.  The first is truly alive and the aren't shy in showcasing their craftsmanship.  And what I especially love is how they turn everyday things into majestic or even fearsome things.  We're dealing with little people here, and what is normal for us human-sized people looks different to those smaller than a finger.  As to character design...really attractive and inviting, while maintaining naturalness and believability.  It's really good seeing studios outside of Disney being able to pull off similarly detailed work.

All in All:
This film is a wonderful addition with a very well told story.  The magic and wonder that enwraps this film is both surprising and astounding.  I'm not sure it's a timeless classic...but it does have moments that come close and definitely sets the bar in what can be done.  In the end, my only real main gripe is the fact that they couldn't think up a better name that better reflects the film...though I guess in a way this tale carried many characteristics of the epic poems of old.",1511913600,,5851,4.690196078431373

5743591,3,B00CWM7EPS,"This is a cute family movie. It's not a wow movie, but it holds your attention. The animation is wonderful and the characters are interesting enough. However, I felt that the story itself was a bit lacking and left something to be desired. It has some cliche story lines and the plot is nothing new. It's very similar to Fern Gully, but not as good. For us, this movie isn't something we will watch over and over again. That said, my kids enjoyed it and it was a good family movie. It's definitely family/kid friendly with any kind of adult reference being over a kids head. I also can't recall anything that might be traumatic to a young child. So it wins on that front too. It's a cute movie to watch when you are out of other things to watch.",1494892800,,745,4.290780141843972

The story was subpar, and character development rushed and lazy. The main character looked fine, but leafmen were squarish in looks and personality. Typical bogmen want to destroy forest and good fairy guys have to stop them. Humor was kind of quirky, but almost as if it were for young audiences to try for a G rating. Not enough risk taken in making it better, which it had the potential for, but meh.",1487548800,,577,4.452830188679245

It wasn't a bad movie but i'll most likely never bother watching it again. My 6yr old really seemed to enjoy it though. Steven Tyler as the caterpillar was pretty cool though. Don't get me wrong, the movie was well acted and everything, but based on the trailer I was expecting a side splitting comedy.

The story is the usual ""must stop the villain from destroying the world"" theme, but done in a very entertaining way.  One thing I still can't get over is the name.

It seemed to me like the moviemakers felt like they had only two hours of time to fit a three hour movie. It's hard to explain what I mean, but I felt like it didn't flow smoothly it had an unrealistic high-speed quality. It gave me the feeling of when you're watching the old Godzilla movies the way the Japanese actors would talk so fast, but the words came out slower. The whole movie just seemed rushed. They should have slowed it down and taken an extra half an hour.",1439164800,,554,4.235849056603773

5743963,3,B00CWM7EPS,"Epic is a really beautiful movie with great animation. The texturing and modeling of the world these character inhabit is truly amazing!! I enjoyed it overall, but like so many animated films these days it falls flat on story. It's sadly cliche and pretty predictable. My 5 year old loved it, so I'm clearly not the target audience, but its always so disappointing when these films could be so much more. Once in a while films come along that both kids and adults can love together. The director Chris Wedge did a terrific job on the original Ice Age and Robots was phenomenal, so I know he's a capable. But this one sadly just doesn't pan out as I had hoped.",1435276800,,659,4.454545454545454

When I first heard about it, I thought it was a movie like Fern Gully where the whole plot would be about saving the trees and animals from the evils of society.  Glad to say my first thought was wrong.  While the actions of the characters do center around saving the life of the forest, the plot is more focused on self-discovery.
The voices are wonderful and the animators have done a wonderful job of being the world of Epic to life.  Full of clean humor and surprises, this was a movie that my whole family enjoyed.",1429574400,,680,4.24031007751938

5744024,4,B00CWM7EPS,This movie had great animation and was very vibrant to watch. I would say it's for kids around 8 and up. It did not hold my 5 year olds attention and she is a movie freak,1428451200,,170,3.75
5744025,3,B00CWM7EPS,"Usually, I LOVE movies and stories in this genre/category (The Arthur and the Invisibles trilogy is actually one of my all-time favorites!). However, some details in this movie left conflicting feelings in my head that I'd rather not have. Now I WILL admit that the first time I saw it in the theater, I loved it just as much as I would love any other movie about fairies and/or tiny people making a big difference in the world. But when I saw it with my mom, she helped me realize some things the movie makers got completely wrong.

WARNING: DON'T CONTINUE READING THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT A SPOILER.

First of all, bats and crows are not evil. Not by a long shot. I hate, hate, HATE that they showed crows as mounts for the bad guys (which they used to attack the hummingbird mounts of the good guys) and portrayed bats as monstrous creatures that actually get tangled up in MK's father's hair as he's running away from them! Those details are SO inaccurate that it's ridiculous! This gives young children a completely wrong impression of two of the world's most interesting and amazing creatures; Crows because they're smarter than some humans, and bats because they're the only species of mammal that can truly fly!

But there's something else - something that's the foundation for the whole story - that's even more of a problem. Its the idea that Rot equals bad and Growth equals good. What the movie makers totally missed is the fact that things that rot are absorbed into the soil and make room and provide energy for new things to grow. You can't have one without the other! The key is balance between them!

So my point is, I really liked this movie. Like most other reviewers said, the animation was incredible and amazingly beautiful. However, there were too many wrong ideas portrayed throughout the story. I can't stand that it gives some animals a bad rep and others a good one.

So... yeah. 3/5 stars, if only for the funny bits and the beautiful animation. The slug and snail made me ROTFLMAO! But other than that... Bleh.",1428451200,,2037,4.6005509641873275

5744080,5,B00CWM7EPS,"My husband and I don't have children, but we both enjoy animated movies. We had NEVER heard of this one, and didn't see any previews beforehand. I enjoyed a lot of aspects of this movie, it reminds me of a lot of my favorite movies. Here is a basic rundown of the plot, I will try not to spoil it...:

A teenage girl loses her mother and must go live with her obsessive, disgraced scientist, father; who believes there are tiny people living in the forest. Meawhile, in the forest, there is a battle being waged between the Boggins and the Queen, who is the life force of all things. The Queen is defended by the Leaf Men, hummingbird riding ""Samurai"" soldiers. The paths of the girl and the Queen entangle during an important forest event that will determine the future of its existence.

This movie felt like
50% Fern Gulley
25% Honey I Shrunk The Kids
25% Fifth Element

...with a dash of a few other movie flavors thrown in.

The only thing I didn't like was the use of the crows and the bats as evil characters. The Boggins represent disease or virus, things that infect and destroy the ecosystem. Bats and crows are both species that help to keep disease in check. Bats control insect population and other species of bats are integral to pollination. Crows are the garbage disposals, and help to clean disease carrying carion from the environment. Aside from that, it was a fun movie that will likely get watched many times.",1424563200,7,1430,4.5310077519379846

5744124,1,B00CWM7EPS,"WARNING- DIGITAL COPY IS SD ONLY!!!
Yes you read that right- this is just inexcusable in this day and age. Of all the BluRay/Digital combos I've purchased over the years, this is the only one that comes with an SD-only digital copy, and for that, they get one star regardless of how good or bad the movie itself is. Of course this isn't mentioned on the product page, and is only mentioned in the tiniest print on the back of the box where I never saw it. So I redeemed the code on iTunes, started it on my Apple TV, and knew something was wrong immediately- it was horribly blurry, and just terrible looking overall. I get my movies primarily for the HD digital copies, and like to have the BluRay as a backup. So buying this with its SD digital copy is totally pointless to me. Had I known this, I wouldn't have bought it. Amazon needs to start listing the details of digital copies clearly on their product pages, and that is where I hold them responsible as well- I've contacted them and it will be interesting to see what they have to say.

UPDATE: Amazon was beyond awesome- they gave me a credit to buy the HD version on Amazon Instant which works for me since I also have Fire TV, so all credit to them for being so understanding (though I still think they need to add details about digital copies on the product pages to avoid situations like this).",1421798400,5,1358,4.346456692913386

5744137,4,B00CWM7EPS,"Not all animated fare is good.  Some of it is lazy, some trite.  Epic may boast a been there, done that storyline but it is most certainly not lazy, and I think that despite the overused storyline the movie is raised high above its competitors because it crams so much into it and does it so well.  Want a Lord of the Rings story for the kids that an adult can enjoy (probably more)?  Pick Epic.  Want extremely rich and dazzling color and cinematic variety in your film?  Its Epic.  Want an eco-friendly tale of good guys and bad guys where the good guys don't actually feel outnumbered but are on more even terms with their contestants?  Pick FernGully.  No!  Scratch that.  That was a joke.  Pick Epic.  In just about every way, from how they staged the exciting and interesting action sequences to the characters who inhabit their personalities, from the bright dazzle of spring colors to even the dark ooze of blacks and grays, Epic seeks to catch your attention and entertain.  And it succeeds.  If you liked the visual richness of Rise of the Guardians then youll be sure to like this movie too.  4.25 stars.",1420761600,,1115,4.527638190954774
5744138,4,B00CWM7EPS,"My son absolutely loves this movie. The first time we watched it, I thought it was a bit odd, but it has grown on me. Boys who like knights will probably like this movie, because the ""Leaf Men"" are basically a legion of tiny knights who protect the (equally tiny) queen of the forest. The action of the movie, while definitely adventurous, doesn't include much violence or fighting---definitely a plus for a younger audience. A kid can get his knight ""fix"" without encountering a lot of violent action onscreen.",1420675200,,511,4.752808988764045

5744360,5,B00CWM7EPS,"Although an adult, I found this film to be very refreshing.  It is about evil vs. good and which will prevail.  In this case it is a matter of Nature, with those who help keep it healthy and those who would destroy it.  Both sides have characters that are nearly microscopic but mirror humans emotions and actions.

A lonely girl who has just lost her mother and has come to live with her father, whom she hardly knows and is a little on the strange side (since he believes  and devotes his life work to finding these tiny characters}, gets involved herself in this new world by doing a good deed and to her shock becomes one of them.

The fight and the resolution of both Nature's health and her relationship with her father is heartwarming.  I could watch this many times and never tire of its goodness.",1408233600,,805,4.398648648648648

5744369,5,B00CWM7EPS,"Back when I was like 3 years old (over 20 years ago), there was this movie called FernGully. I'm sure some of you remember it. It had to do with saving the forest from an evil unknown to its inhabitants. It was one of my favorite movies growing up.

Epic is a lot like FernGully, but in this tale, the evil isn't the big people or the machinery and smoke that they bring. It's the other, more sinister inhabitants of the woods.  Epic isn't full of mythical fairies or anything though. It just has ordinary small people called leaf men, who protect and interact with the plants of the forest. This movie has a heart-felt story with beautiful flight and landscape animation that will take your breath away (There was even once I caught the animated rise and fall of one of the character's chests to make it look like he was actually breathing). You might just lose yourself for a bit.",1407974400,,882,4.438271604938271

5744415,5,B00CWM7EPS,"This was a really fun movie. It's one that's requested for probably at least once every couple weeks. It kind of reminded me of Ferngully, a movie I watched a lot as a kid, where somebody gets shrunk down to the size of some forestry creatures. It's got a bit of a different storyline and message of course, but the method was familiar to me personally.
The characters were a lot of fun for the kids, and they like the music a lot too. The animation was very good, and very creative. There is a lot going for this movie like humor, action, and love. Which makes it easy for us dads to sit through it during movie time!
Personally, I don't know where the name ""Epic"" comes from for this movie. It's really great, but I don't think me or my kids would call it Epic. I'm not going to take a star off for it, but it's always kind of been a head scratcher for me.",1406419200,4,858,4.113095238095238

5744544,5,B00CWM7EPS,"It's choppy and the relationships are clumsy and some of the characters are annoyingly difficult to look at in an otherwise visually beautiful movie BUT it's the perfect fantasy for me.  A world of tiny creatures right in the back yard?  I'm there!  Beyonce eats some of her lines but I blame that on the directors, otherwise she's really good.

Ok, it makes me tear up a little almost every time HOWEVER why does the dog have to be a zombie dog?  Missing an eye and a leg?  Really?  That's completely unnecessary.

And why does the father have to look so dorky?  I mean the wife and daughter are gorgeous.

And why do the leafmen have no foreheads?

And what is the villain?

I would have liked to hate the villain a bit more.

BUT... I'll watch it again.  Possibly tonight.",1400371200,,775,4.404255319148936

5744546,3,B00CWM7EPS,"I love animation so I see whatever comes out, no matter what.  This movie fell short of my expectations, which were high since it came from the creators of Ice Age.  It is beautiful and the characters are individually interesting but the story didn't flow very well.  It was as if it was made up of blocks of action that were created by more than one team, then strung together.  Also, while it did have a happy ending, it wasn't even close to the one I wanted for the Leafmen or the humans.  Maybe there'll be a sequel which will address the things I felt were left unfinished.",1400284800,2,578,4.314814814814815

5744549,4,B00CWM7EPS,"A smooth blend of live-action and animation, Epic pleases on a number of levels.  It is the story of an estranged father and his teen daughter, both of whom mourn the loss of the wife/mother and who have not seen one another for many years.  It is a story of blame and understanding, of the nature of love and loss.  It is a story of responsibility and growing up.  It is a rousing, rollicking adventure, a battle between Life and Death, growth and decay.  Epic is beautifully drawn and animated.  It is easy to suspend disbelief and envision a world of small people with big issues which we ignore at our peril.  Epic appeals to all ages for different reasons, and the parents should enjoy it as much as their kids will.  The father is a befuddled scientist who lost his wife and daughter years ago because he would not give over his determined belief that the woods is peopled with tiny men.  Oddly, it is.  As he learns to cherish his daughter, she learns to value his obsessive pursuit of what he believes to be true.  They both find a future they never expected.",1400198400,,1067,4.420512820512821

5744571,3,B00CWM7EPS,"This movie had stunning graphics. Unfortunately, after that I found myself not totally loving it and not able to initially put my finger on the problem. Yes, the story is a bit of a cliche - but I can get past that. And, yes . . . the ending isn't very satisfying. But that didn't drive me nuts.  I usually love these kinds of movies so what was wrong? In the end, what I found uncomfortable was the way the animals were portrayed.  Funny, I know . . . but it left me more unsettled than I realized. Watching a 3-legged, half-blind dog (albeit he was a cutie) fall over, run into things, etc., didn't make me laugh . . . it made me cringe. Having a sweet looking, furry little mouse turn into a bad guy also made me cringe. And there were other examples. That was the problem with the movie for me - cliche or not - there were places that the story just seemed out of step with what I consider normal fantastical storytelling. Because of this, I couldn't go more than about 4-5 minutes without wishing something had been a bit different - dialogue, character portrayal, something.  With that constant underlying psychological distraction . . . how on this planet could I get lost in the magic of the movie? Not gonna happen!",1398988800,2,1224,4.359649122807017

I watched it in 3D and I almost felt I was in the woods with the leaf people. The conflict between the Leafmen and the Boggans was quite intense at times. The characters were so well animated that they appeared almost real.

5744584,4,B00CWM7EPS,"Blue Sky Studios, the animation posse that rolled out Ice Age and Rio, released Epic in 2013, keenly ambitious to achieve competitive status with Pixar and with DreamWorks. Instead Blue Sky merely treads water. Epic adapts William Joyce's classic children's picture book, ""The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs.""

Beneath our noses, beyond our ken, a mighty war rages for the soul of our ecosystem - and, hopefully, I didn't lose anyone just then with that mention of ""ecosystem."" Gratifyingly, this movie doesn't try to sway you with a dreary environmentalist message. It's not Ferngully risen from the dead. We're alerted to the existence of an enchanted realm that you and I habitually walk over and past. In this miniature world, the brave Leafmen, 2"" tall forest sprites astride hummingbirds and wearing armor fashioned from the exoskeletons of bugs, wage fierce combat with the Boggans, fell creatures that resemble storybook trolls and goblins. It's a difference in ideology, you see. The Boggans fervently espouse a universal state of rot and decay. They mean to expand their putrefying kingdom of Rotwood. The Leafmen would rather say, ""No, thank you.""

And, in the human world, there's unhappy 17-year-old Mary Katherine (voiced by Amanda Seyfried), come to visit her estranged scientist father, Professor Bomba (Jason Sudeikis). Prof. Bomba is one of them absent-minded sorts who lives in a ramshackle house by the woods. Someone observes: ""That's not a house. That's termites holding hands.""

Note that the professor isn't a bad guy. He doesn't mean to be a bad dad. He's excessively preoccupied  with his work and seriously eccentric. I don't know that there would've been an ideal period for Mary Katherine - or just ""MK"" - to move in. Expect the awkwardness between them. Anticipate a wealth of confusion from the pater, bursts of hostility from the child.

For years Professor Bomba has been super-obsessed with gathering evidence about the existence of a miniature society. But it's MK who inadvertently makes the breakthru when she's transported (ie: shrunk down to 2 inches) to the Leafmen's world. Her immediate reaction: ""Who are you people? Is this some sort of reenactment?"" MK is promptly recruited by Queen Tara (Beyonc Knowles), a beleaguered nature spirit, to safeguard a fragile pod from which the heir apparent will emerge to set things right. MK is accompanied in her quest by two pod caretakers in the form of a snail and a slug (they, uh, keep the pods moist), the impulsive young Leafman Nod (Josh Hutcherson), and the stern veteran soldier Ronin who at one point is announced as the ""defender of the weak, pooper of parties"" (Colin Farrell).

Does Epic have massive rewatchability? Sure, if you're looking at it from a visual perspective. The film looks spectacular, replete with striking character designs and a lush, dizzying visual palette that recalls A Bug's Life. The voice talents are of all-star caliber, even Pitbull and Steven Tyler don't embarass themselves. The action sequences are choreographed with flair. Love the embattled hummingbirds in flitting motion.

3.5 out of 5 stars, mostly because of the stellar animation. Maybe someone was being tongue-in-cheek when they came up with the film title. To me, the scope of the narrative falls short of epic. There's a place for a work like Epic, sure. It falls in that category of safe filmmaking. That old list is whipped out, those trope boxes are checked off. Story-wise, nothing stands out, not the plodding hero's quest, not the angry teen who's suffered a loss, not the oblivious parent, not the bland young hero or the wise veteran, and not the comic relief mollusks. Maybe there's something to using invertebrate creatures for running gags. The humor will titillate them young 'uns, you betcha, but it's humor that favors the spineless approach. If there's a defining passion present, it's more a mercenary bend that's directed towards the marketing of Epic toys, shirts, and video games. I wonder, are there mass-market action figures spinning out of indie films by independent artists like Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle), Marjane Satrapi & Vincent Parronaud (Persepolis), or Jean-Loup Felicioli & Alain Gagnol (A Cat in Paris)? Brad Bird's The Iron Giant, considered both a commercial film and an artistic triumph, probably comes closest to spooling out commercial merchandise. Sorry, it's 2:30am and I just caught myself ranting. Listen, if you're just looking to park your kid in front of the screen for a mo, then Epic is your huckleberry. It ticks me off, though. It's so good to look at, the animation is impeccable. It's deserving of a story with more heft, more originality, even more spark. Having said that, my niece wants plush toys of the slug and the snail. Dammit.

The DVD's bonus stuff:

- ""Birds, Bugs and Slugs: Forest Explorer"" - a look at the real-life creatures the film characters are based on (00:05:21 minutes)
- ""Bugs of Camouflage"" - Ken the Bug Guy explains bugs that employ camouflage (00:03:45 minutes)
- ""Rot Rocks"" - a tutorial on how rot and decay actually help to maintain balance in our ecosystem (00:03:18 minutes)
- Theatrical Trailer",1398038400,,5195,5.059579439252336
5744585,5,B00CWM7EPS,I am a kindergarten teacher and one of my favorite books was the Leaf Men.  I read this book almost every year. The book story is very different from the movie except for the leaf men.  This movie is so beautifully done and fantastical in the most wonderful way. I never get tired of just looking at it.  The slug and the snail are wonderful additions of humor and fun. The only thing I felt sad about was that Ronin lost his love.  I would love it if another movie would make that happen.,1397779200,,489,4.170212765957447

The good side lives in a beautiful rendered forest full of trees and birds.  The good side is led by a queen and Ronin, the leader of the Leafmen.  The Leafmen are the warriors that protect the queen and the forest life.  There is a fair amount of battling with swords and arrows, but no graphic violence.  I don't remember any bad language or inappropriate sequences for kids.  Given the cartoon fighting, I would recommend it for 4-5 year olds or older.",1397520000,,867,4.607843137254902

It's a typical good vs. evil fairy tale with a beautiful queen, an ugly villain and an unwitting hero who saves the world. It's formulaic in the extreme. That said, it is beautiful to watch and thoroughly entertaining. Also, hummingbirds with saddles!",1394409600,,376,4.984126984126984

5744644,3,B00CWM7EPS,This movie is geared more to an older group of people. Its way to in depth for any child to really enjoy too much story going on to follow .

As a parent I also don't mind watching it over and over since any parent understands how kids will ask for the same movie again and again.

5744699,1,B00CWM7EPS,"when i hear a term like 'epic', i except a grand adventure. i'm not talking about literal size perception with that term but i wanted something huge and daring!

well, this story is anything but it. sure, it's 'huge' and 'grand' but the story is lacking. a random romance between a stomper and the small people is lackluster, obviously the only strong black lead dies instantly and we are left with these underdeveloped characters. i'm not talking about the 'stompers' but rather the small world. they're interesting, they move just faster than average humans, they can do incredible things! but all we see is two whiny kids with daddy issues and a masculine guy trying too hard to act bad-ass.

blue sky makes a beautiful movie and it is on level with avatar when it comes to extreme bright colors and wonderfully decorated places. the main character in herself is bland. the dad is slightly more interesting but, of course, he isn't the main focus. in all honesty, i want to see how he got into the idea of searching for small people. really, what made him abandon his family in the first place? obviously he's making money since his house is HUGE and well taken care of in the inside. instead, you get this girl trying to be strong and gets everything right (and wrong at the same time oddly enough). i felt like they wanted this to be something grand and wonderful but it came out short.

the character designs are beautiful but not unique. i'm cool with that. they took use of getting away with extremely bright colors and engaging the audience in that way.

for me, this movie is a huge letdown no matter what. every moment that passed by, i knew what was going to happen. and the villains... what was even their motive?

""let's destroy s*** because.. YOU KNOW, WE'RE EVIL! MWAHAHAHAHA!""

NO. NOT ALL VILLAINS THINK LIKE THIS. this isn't the early comic book era where evil people wanted to just kill themselves around with the planet. killing the earth won't benefit them. they obviously eat animals and if they kill the plants then... where would they get food from? SO MANY ISSUES. i know it's a cartoon but other cartoons are more graceful about their execution.

this company had a concept that's been done many times before but they went down a dull path with it.",1391126400,10,2275,4.616336633663367

5744721,3,B00CWM7EPS,"Blue Sky Studios rarely receives the type of hype that surrounds Pixar/ Disney or DreamWorks yet if you think about it; these guys were around from the beginning.  Their first big CG feature film (Ice Age) came out way back in 2002 and they followed that up with a whole host of Ice Age sequels and spin offs, Horton Hears a Who, Robots, Rio and now Epic.

Like Disneys Meet the Robinsons and DreamWorks Ride of the Guardians before it, Epic is based upon one of William Joyces art-centric books, in this case The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs.

Ive got to get the most significant out of the way first- the film is absolutely beautiful.  From textures to particle effects to color pallet and lighting, Epic sets all kinds of benchmarks in the potential of computer generated imaging.  Some of the many forest settings and even the human character models come off as so life-like as to demand a double take to be certain some live action photography hadnt been snuck into the piece.  However, lush visuals do not a perfect film make and Epic isn't without its flaws but well get to all that.

Epic tells of a lonely human teen MK (Amanda Seyfried), forced to live with her eccentric (but annoyingly goofy) father in the wake of her mothers passing who, by a series of events, becomes shrunk by a fairy queen to aid a group of magical forest dwellers in their battle against decay-spreading bad guys called Boggans.

Once shrunk down to microscopic proportions, the viewer is introduced to a whole host of standard issue fantasy archetypes: A beautiful queen with a noble heart and magical powers Tara (Beyonc Knowles), a veteran warrior Ronin (Collin Farrell) tasked with the tutelage of immature and irresponsible young warrior Nod for MKs flirting needs (Josh Hutcherson).  We get attempts of comic relief in the form of a snail and slug tag team voiced by Chris ODowd and Aziz Ansari respectively.  The villains are copy and pasted bad guys (led by Christopher Waltz as Mandrake) and lack any sort of motivation or backstory.  All you need to know is that they represent death and decay while the good guys (the Leafmen) represent growth and renewal.

It would be very fair to say that while Epic commits no major crimes across its 103-minute runtime, it also takes no chances and introduces nothing memorable or enduring to the genre either.  Younger viewers will be likely be far more forgiving due to the whimsical nature of the setting and characters but the screenplay really does the film no favors by falling victim to just about every clich in the book.  Couple this to the fact that a lack of backstory really leaves countless unanswered questions to ponder.  Among these: Is this struggle of life versus decay limited to this particular forest or are such tiny battling sprites in every forest around the world? How did the Boggans obtain the power of death initially and, while they acknowledge the existence of balance as being crucial, what motivates them to attempt to upset a balance that has presumably existed since the dawn of time.

Again, this might be existential ponderings that will never cross the intended demographics collective mind but it does contribute to the nagging sensation that this film wasn't created out of passion and inspiration so much as it was manufactured; created by committees to hit all the right notes at exactly the right times.  It succeeds, like it should, in a few segments but never does it fully shake the feeling that its all been recycled either.

Danny Elfmans score isn't quite the soaring whimsical composure weve come to expect from him but it is serviceable and an end-credits song from Beyonce is entirely forgettable.

In all the visuals alone make this one worth checking out and it does bring an hour-and-a-halfs worth of adventure to the screen with a hardy dose of panache.  Sadly hints of what this one could have been continually make their presence felt and thats the real tragedy here.",1390435200,2,3962,4.764619883040936

Now, put these against the tale of a tiny forest people whose next queen is in peril and the threat of an invading army.  This is a wonderful tale of fantasy, comedy, drama and fantastic adventure. The talented voice cast Amanda Seyfried, Colin Farrell, Beyonce Knowles, Jason Sudekis, Christph Walz, Josh Hutcherson, Steven Tyler, Pitbull, Aziz Ansari, and Chris O'Dowd carries off this wonderful movie with heart and humor.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Am I the only one that's sad about DreamWorks leaving Paramount behind as a distributing partner and making the transition over to Fox? Fox hasn't had a very good track record with animation, so this move really had me worried, that is until now. 'EPIC' isn't on par with PIXAR or DreamWorks type of quality, but it's a step in the right direction and a much stronger effort than other Fox-distributed films.

Mary Katherine [Amanda Seyfried], known as M.K., who is named after William Joyce's deceased daughter, is in a hard period in her life. The animation film opens shortly after her mother's funeral. Not quite old enough to be on her own, she is moving in with her father [Jason Sudeikis], who she hasn't seen in years. M.K.'s parents divorced long ago, a major source of the marital problems being her dad's obsession with his scientific work. Sadly, nothing has changed. He still places 100 percent of his efforts in proving that tiny people exist within the forest. He believes that these small people, known as ""Leafmen"" who serve as the guardians of nature. Of course, we quickly learn that he's correct, that the ""Leafmen"" are in a constant battle against equally tiny bad guys called ""Boggins"" who promote rot and decay.

Shortly after M.K. arrives at her father's home, the lore of the forest is explained to us. You see, forests have always thrived because a powerful fairy queen [Beyonc&eacute;] carries ""the spirit of the forest."" Every so many years, she passes that spirit along to another being. The day that M.K. arrives just-so-happens to be the day that the queen is going to pass along the spirit. As the ""Leafmen"" assist the queen, the Boggin army attacks and thwarts their plans, trying to steal the spirit of life and corrupting it with rot. As M.K. wanders through the forest, she stumbles upon the queen and gets pulled into their worldand shrunken down and everything. With the help of the head of the Leafmen [Colin Farrell] and a cute young ""Leafmen"" soldier [Josh Hutcherson], M.K. must restore a healthy balance to the forest and put a stop to the ""Boggins"" decay before it can destroy the entire forest.

There are plenty of wordy serious moments, but they're intermingled with good fun. Just to keep the kids entertained, there are even silly childish moments, especially those with the slug and snail [Aziz Ansari and Chris O'Dowd]. A good amount of comedy is infused for the parental audiences. Here's to hoping that this upward trend of light-heartedness and humour continues and that DreamWorks has a positive influence on Fox. By the way, as a sort of protest, I here and now declare that I hate and detest Chris O'Dowd, as I think he is the most worst, horrible and stupid actor to ever be on this planet and I wish he was banished forever.

Although the script is a bit hit and miss, at least the voice cast carries the film right along. The surprise performance comes from Josh Hutcherson, who is rather boring in his live-action film roles, but his vocal performance in 'Epic' is easily the best thing that he's done so far. Seyfried, Beyonc&eacute;, Aziz Ansari and Chris O'Dowd are solid. Colin Farrell is very good. And a few other surprise performances come from Steven Tyler and Christoph Waltz. Of course Christoph Waltz's unmistakable voice is lent to the villainous head ""Boggin."" 2013 was loaded with lots of animated family films, but none of them have been amazing, but to me 'EPIC' is one of the year's better 3D animation film.

Blu-ray Video Quality  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment has given us the 3D Blu-ray in a three-disc and five-format release. Fox has given 'EPIC' an absolutely flawless 3D 1080p awesome encoded image in a equally awesome 2.40:1 aspect ratio. Animation is always the best format for 3D Blu-rays and 'EPIC' is no exception and looks even more stunning, than when I saw this 3D release in the cinema. 'EPIC' doesn't use gimmicky 3D of forcing images off the screen, which is rare for a 3D animation film. Instead, it pushes the world of the film deep beyond the face of the television, as if the borders of the screen are the framing of a window. The world created is visually appealing, appearing like the images of fantasies in the mind of a child. Taking place in large settings, there are layers upon layers of material that extend the picture far into the background. From dust particles floating through the foreground to the blowing trees of the background, the distance between the two is an infinite playing field for the action of the film. There is never a lack of depth. The filmmakers ensured that objects are constantly placed in all areas of this setting. While some films make you forget that you are watching a 3D film, but with 'EPIC,' the amazing environments are subconscious realistic. I appreciate the amount of detail that 'EPIC' was given. The lighting of the forest gives the picture a warm and glowing softness that carries a stark contrast with the lifeless world of the ""Boggins."" No matter which of the two settings we're in, fine details are visible. Be it hairs on a bee's body, leafy patterns, rough bark or oily bird feathers, textures and fine features can always be seen. The animation film is so strong that it leaves no room for banding or aliasing. Colours are so vibrant that when we see the grey result of the ""Boggins"" decay, the gravity of their rot carries a strong emphasis. Black levels are deep and rich without removing the fantastic fine details. After watching the film twice, once in 3D and once in 2D, I cannot find a single fault with the impressive picture quality.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  I love that more and more studios are starting to go with 7.1 audio. Fox has given 'EPIC' an awesome 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio treatments. Just as much love was put into the audio mix as the video quality. From the very opening scene, the amazing dynamics of the audio mix become evident. Set mostly in forests, environmental sounds of cicadas, birds and bugs are layered throughout the channels. The sounds of a breeze blowing through leaves of a tree create an imaging effect that allows you to follow the direction of the wind. Other sounds, such as soaring arrows or passing bats and birds, also show off the strength of imaging. All speakers are constantly lit up with these great examples of environmental effects mixing. The vocal tracks are absolutely clean and clear. Large crowd scenes offer background banter that emits from all channels. Music also plays perfectly. Be it Steven Tyler's in-movie song, Beyonc&eacute; Knowles's closing credits track or Danny Elfman's score, the music is a great-sounding spacer-filler.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: Please note that all Special Features are contained on the 2D Blu-ray disc, but aside from the ""Sneak Peeks"" they are all HD exclusives.

Special Feature: Birds, Bugs and Slugs: Forest Explorer [2013] [1080p] [2.40:1] [5:21] Serving as a miniature nature documentary, this feature briefly teaches children about some of the real life creatures and plants featured in 'EPIC.'

Special Feature: Rot Rocks [2013] [1080p] [2.40:1] [3:18] The villainous threat in 'EPIC' is decay, but this documentary explains how the act of rotting is a beneficial part of nature.

Special Feature: Bugs of Camouflage [2013] [1080p] [2.40:1] [3:44] Take a look at some of nature's very best bugs at blending in and surviving.

Special Feature: The 'EPIC' Life at 2 Inches [2013] [1080p] [2.40:1] [3:42] Here is a special feature made for adults! This brief video scientifically explains how the human body would function at a height of two inches. Who knows how factual this information is, but it's definitely interesting.

Special Feature: Mysteries of Moonhaven Revealed [2013] [1080p] [2.40:1] [24:39] Broken into seven chapters and viewable as a ""play all"" feature. This feature dives into the making of the film. While the documentary supported the film's content, this one breaks down the film and how it came to be especially the characters, the story, the animation, etc.

Theatrical Trailer [2013] [1080p] [2.40:1] [2:12] Like the film, this film trailer is very well crafted.

Sneak Peeks [1080p] [10:55] To watch all of the trailers, they are only available via the 2D Blu-ray disc, plus as well as a commercial for Team Energy Star and the trailers for 'Turbo,' 'Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness' and 'Dragons: Riders of Berk.'

Finally, because the trailers for 'EPIC' made it out to be a mish-mash of other family films, I literally expected nothing from it when I popped in the Blu-ray disc. Much to my surprise, I found it to be quite enjoyable and much better than the most of this summer's other family films and enjoyed it from beginning to end. The story of 'EPIC' isn't the most unique, but it also isn't without its creative charm. The 3D Blu-ray set includes every possible digital format of the film [3D Blu-ray, 2D Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Copy and Ultraviolet] and it also comes with extracurricular family entertainment. A packet containing two sets of easy-to-grow seeds is included, but I have no idea why they included this, as to me it was a wasted addition, but I suppose if you have a garden, then you will think it a good bonus. The flawless audio and video qualities of the 3D Blu-ray are just another reason this set is a worthy purchase. Most of the special features are directed towards mainly children, but there's a decent 25-minute making-of for the adults also. So all in all this is an amazing Blu-ray packaged and had a totally entertaining awesome experience and again the 3D was also totally awesome and made you feel you was in the actual forest and I am so proud it has been added to my 3D Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

5744766,4,B00CWM7EPS,This movie was cute and fun for a family night with a young child.  Better than most really.  The animation and voice acting was well done.  The ending wasn't overly satisfying though.,1389312000,,184,4.6875

5744770,4,B00CWM7EPS,"Familiar.  That's what I kept thinking as I watched this movie.  Why does it seem so familiar?  As opposed to fresh, new, and exciting.  (Shades of FernGully and Arthur and the Invisibles).

The original title for this movie was Leaf Men.  But the marketing department of Fox changed the title to Epic (even though this movie is anything but epic).  The story is packed with the usual stock characters starting with a girl (Amanda Seyfried voicing M.K.) who gets shrunk like Alice in Wonderland so she can walk and talk with the flowers.  There's the obligatory rebel/slacker boy (Josh Hutcherson), the wise and brave warrior Ronin (Colin Farrell), the gratuitously absentminded professor (Jason Sudeikis), and two `cute' sidekicks Mub and Grub (a snail and slug).  Naturally, there is a villain, Mandrake, leader of the Boggans (voiced by Christoph Waltz).  The usual conflicts arise, a fight between good and evil, the need to protect THE forest.  The outcome is just what you'd expect.  Getting there required nothing that hasn't been done before in countless other adventure flicks.

On the plus side, this is a beautiful animated feature, lovely to behold.  The musical score by Danny Elfman is exceptional (I bought the CD).  Some of the voice talent makes sense and works great (some voices simply distract).  It is a likable movie.  But it is painfully familiar and wholly unoriginal.",1389225600,,1392,5.035087719298246
5744771,5,B00CWM7EPS,Even the adults thought this one was cute. Kids loved watching them fly. I would recommend this movie especially if you have young kids.,1389225600,,136,4.708333333333333
5744772,5,B00CWM7EPS,Beautiful colors. Great voice acting!  This movie is truly... EPIC.  I wasn't sure how this would be because of how little I heard about it.  I gave the blu-ray a shot and got it for my kids for Christmas.  We all sat there watching this in awe! Such an AWESOME looking movie.,1389225600,,276,4.25

5744777,5,B00CWM7EPS,"Very engaging.  Left wishing that the special features -- aimed at an elementary school audience -- told the story of how they did it, but then who wants to know all the secrets of magic?  As an adult without children, I was delighted in a great adult experience -- but I am a romantic who still has an escapist streak for fantasy.",1389225600,,331,4.32258064516129

Once in 3D where my son sat perch on the edge of his seat enthralled by the movie. The trance was only broken briefly for a bathroom break. We watched it again when it was a free family movie at a local theater. We even borrowed it from Netflix and watched it a couple of times before returning. It is a very colorful movie. It has some great funny moments and lots of action. Clearly I don't mind if my kids want to watch this one over and over again. We all know that's what kids do, so I make sure the movies we get are ones that aren't going to annoy ME during multiple repeated watchings.",1389052800,4,691,4.088235294117647

5744818,5,B00CWM7EPS,"Great animation and a delightful story. My husband and I were worried that the pc police were going to shove more pc compost down our throats when we tentatively took our children to this movie. (Eg. evil human beings indiscriminately and selfishly destroy all of nature and cause global warming.) We were pleasantly surprised, that it reflected the more common truth that nature turns on itself in most cases; there are predators and prey within the animal kingdom and do a good job of killing/defending without man's blame/intervention. (This is why I gave it its fifth star.) The relationships between the different ""ecosystem families"" were well developed and realistically touching--no family is perfect and we need to be patient and give each other the benefit of the doubt. I don't think it ever got sappy, and even showed some depth. So it made the cut for a dvd purchase.

While the animation is stunningly beautiful and feels very real, I think the title ""Epic"" is a bit of stretch. Definitely not cutesy like a Tinker Bell movie, but very few movies could deserve the title ""Epic"".",1388620800,,1092,4.870967741935484

5744862,4,B00CWM7EPS,"I thought the quality of the animation and the story line were very good.  In many ways it was a typical story of being miniaturized into the natural world and learning life lessons--the kind of story that has been around since before my generation. But,being a fan of Tolkien, etc. I found the whole idea fascinating.
  However, I don't really appreciate having to buy three disks when I only need one.  I don't play movies on my computer much since I don't travel much with a computer.  There is no movie that I must see whenever I'm on the road.  It can wait until I get back home.  I wish that companies would stop assuming that everyone does and wants the same thing.  I am forced to pay a higher price than should be necessary.  For that reason I normally wait until the film is on pay-per-view on TV or is offered on Netflix.

The film animation was beautifully made but the story was boring, weak and predictable. It was a film about the good guys and the bad guys, the them and us, the good against evil, which has been done many times and much better in other films. Epic just shows nature battling itself. Why would nature want to destroy itself?! I also was not drawn in by the main characters.
There was nothing about the real threat to the environment, such as man destroying the forest and the natural order of nature. Perhaps It was because I have seen many other animations were they are able to tell the story of man, nature, and still show a stunningly beautiful and entertaining film without being preachy. In the end the only thing that saved this film was its animation.",1387238400,,851,4.496774193548387

Loosely based on William Joyces The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs, Epic is an unusually imaginative and charming computer-animated feature about some wee soldiers (known as Leafmen) who live in the forest and the young girl from the real world who shrinks down to their size and joins them in their life-or-death battle against the dreaded Boggans.

Like Dorothy and Alice before her, seventeen-year-old Mary Katherine (Amanda Seyfried), M.K. for short,  is the human protagonist who is miraculously transported to a fantastical world filled with strange creatures (some nice, some not so nice) and life-threatening dangers, a place of both good and evil, heroes and villains, beauty and menace where missions are to be accomplished and lessons learned.

Directed with verve and style by Chris Wedge, the movie features terrific voice work by Colin Farrell, Josh Hutcherson, Christopher Waltz, Chris ODowd, Jason Sudeikis, Steven Tyler and Beyonce Knowles. But its Aziz Ansari, from TVs Parks and Recreation, who steals the show as a sly and snide little slug named Mub.

Though less highly acclaimed than a number of more heavily promoted animated features, Epic, for my money, holds its own with the best of them. Its fast-paced, witty and visually splendid and it never talks down to its audience. And its originality alone secures it a place in the canon.",1386806400,,1371,5.130044843049327

5744934,3,B00CWM7EPS,The animation was of course amazing as was the texture and rendering. But the story borrowed heavily from Fern Gully and was very predictable. The story was trite and boring.

Almost every movie I've ordered has given me those issues. I have to restart at least 4 - 6 times.  There should be a few movies of our choice downloaded for free because of this. But wait, they might freeze too.  It was a good idea but an unfinished one to stream movies Amazon.  Fix this soon or I can see this becoming a failed venture.",1386028800,,510,4.06

5744949,3,B00CWM7EPS,Would have been better if it would play all the way through without constant playback error. When I pay 4.99 to watch a children's movie I want to watch it all the way through( because children have short attention spans) not get the message 10-15 times that amazon is having a problem playing the chosen title please try again later or choose a different title! that doesn't work for me.,1385683200,,388,4.557142857142857

Nooooo, not this movie as it comes with a Disc for Digital Copy in which you unlock the copy by inputting a code. Yes, this can be unlocked in Itunes which can be viewed on the different Apple products!

5745011,1,B00CWM7EPS,don't spend any of your time watching this.  it had a terrible story line and it didn't introduce the characters.  it had a creative thought to it but it was just not done very well,1383264000,,181,4.142857142857143
5745012,5,B00CWM7EPS,"This was a wonderful animated movie not just for the kids, but for the whole family as well.  Recommend watching.",1383264000,,113,4.65
5745013,4,B00CWM7EPS,I enjoyed watching this with my grandchildren.  Nice storyline and characters.  It held the attention of my 7 year old grandson much longer than my 3 yr old granddaughter.  Happy we rented it.,1383264000,,192,4.757575757575758
5745014,1,B00CWM7EPS,This was a little too violent for me and it was making my 2 year old sort of agitated while watching it.,1383264000,,104,3.772727272727273
5745015,5,B00CWM7EPS,Great family movie! Both my 5 year old and 16 year old enjoyed it. I had a lot of action.,1383091200,,89,3.5

5745018,3,B00CWM7EPS,I tried watch this on my Wii with the Amazon Instant app. The video kept skipping or crashing every ten minutes or so. I probably won't use Instant again.,1383004800,,154,4.344827586206897
5745019,2,B00CWM7EPS,"Very pretty graphics in this animated story about the good little nature people and the bad little people out to destroy them and the world for some reason - I guess because they're just so bad. The film features uninteresting characters for the most part like the snail sidekicks with all their snot jokes, how droll. Derivative, unoriginal plot has the daughter and father drifting apart after the mother's death. But then, they bond - wow, I didn't see that one coming! And we also have the young woman getting shrunk down to teensy size - honey, I shrunk the toon.  Some of the animations were very pretty though. It's a shame to see fine craftsmanship enlisted in the service of such a drab, unoriginal story.",1383004800,3,714,4.666666666666667

Epic has some of the most beautiful 3D animation I've experienced since Avatar. The director obviously had 3D viewing in mind when they created this movie. It's gorgeous. Great cast, great story, flawless animation and rendering. A must-have in anyone's Blu Ray 3D collection.",1382918400,4,422,4.794520547945205
5745022,5,B00CWM7EPS,Just plain fun for the whole family.  We all enjoyed.  Worth the watch. Good versus evil in the forest (with a little romance thrown in).,1382918400,,137,4.44
5745023,5,B00CWM7EPS,"This DVD arrived on time and in very good condition. The 3D movie would not play in my Blu-ray 3D player. it will go through the steps like its going to play, then it would eject. My player is practical new.",1382918400,,207,4.073170731707317

5745028,5,B00CWM7EPS,"Better than I expected.  We all liked it.  However, I only BUY 3D movies and I am not ready to spend the extra money to be able to watch the movie again and again.",1382918400,,163,3.764705882352941
5745029,4,B00CWM7EPS,"This is such a cute movie. If you are looking for a good children's movie than this is it. For an adult it is of course very predictable, but it is still fun to watch.",1382918400,,167,3.8
5745030,3,B00CWM7EPS,This movie to me was not as good as it looked on commercials. It was okay but didn't hold my attention that much. I have many animation movies and am glad I didn't pay full price.,1382832000,,179,4.0
5745031,5,B00CWM7EPS,"This is another blu-ray I bought for the 3d. I honestly never even heard of this movie before being released to disc so I didn't know what to expect. I think of this movie like a combination of Fern Gully, Avatar, and Tangled. The female lead is a positive role model for young people. The artwork is beautiful and there is plenty of laughs. The 3D in this movie is absolutely amazing. If I had to pick one movie to show off the advantages of 3d I think this one might be it.",1382832000,2,475,4.118279569892473
5745032,5,B00CWM7EPS,Great story line on so many levels and I'm so glad I saw it first in the theater simply because of the fabulous animation. The story line is as fulfilling for this middle-aged adult as it was for the kids in the audience (although probably for different reasons).,1382832000,,263,4.5
5745033,5,B00CWM7EPS,Great movie and had some pretty funny parts. The kids love it and can watch it over and over and over again.,1382745600,,108,3.9545454545454546

5745035,3,B00CWM7EPS,"My kids actually enjoyed the movie. IMO it wasn't that great of a flick. Not a terrible movie...but a pretty bland offering if you ask me. No stand out performances voice wise.  But the 4yr old and the 6yr old loved it, so thats all that mattered for me. :)",1382745600,,257,4.14
5745036,4,B00CWM7EPS,"Loved the graphics (although my reception was not so great with the HD).  Great story with a happy but not perfect ending, and good humor along the way.  It made me miss my dad",1382659200,,176,4.147058823529412
5745037,5,B00CWM7EPS,"This movie deserved a better title than ""Epic"". Mind you, finding out there are tiny people living among us would in fact be epic, but I think it deserved a better suited name. What that name should be, I don't know. Regardless, we really enjoyed this movie!!! 5 stars.",1382659200,,269,4.510204081632653

5745040,5,B00CWM7EPS,"We went to see this in the theater with low expectations, and we certainly weren't sure if our 3-year-old daughter would be into it. But she was! We all loved it, and now we own it :) It's definitely an epic adventure with some advanced themes, but there are some light-hearted moments, too, especially with the slug/snail -- Aziz Ansari as the slug is brilliant. Highly recommend the movie!",1382572800,,391,4.681159420289855

5745043,5,B00CWM7EPS,This is the best movie ever. I love the 3D effects! I went to see it at the theater with my four year old and we left the theater because he lost interest.

Films like ""How to Train Your Dragon"" appeal both to kids and adults. The storyline, including twists and character development, must be accessible to kids but must also be relevant and entertaining to adults. Weaving adult sophistication into a kid's film is a fine art. ""Epic"" so nearly succeeds; it is funny and clever and beautiful. It is just the last five minutes that fail to deliver - I can only assume they intended a second film, an ""Epic II"" but honestly I'd be surprised if that happened. I still recommend the film because I was entertained and mesmerized by the visuals and the witty script.",1380499200,2,734,4.6976744186046515

5745188,4,B00CWM7EPS,"I knew little about Epic upon renting it - and my wife and I were totally enthralled.  Some parts of the film are a bit formulaic, possibly borrowing from similar films like FernGully and Arthur & The Invisibles.  However, we enjoyed the film immensely.  The animation is glorious and the characters likeable.  The villain is typical two-dimensional but supplies a good antagonist.  Beyonce as the queen is pretty weak, but her role is so small as not to detract from the plot.

All in all, I'd say this is a good family film with rich emotions, decent dialogue and even good comedy (supplied by the slug and snail).

Highly recommended!",1380412800,,637,4.736363636363636

5745215,3,B00CWM7EPS,"Great effort overall.  We (me, my wife, and young kids) tried three times to get through this without snoozing off at some point, but couldn't.  Great promise in that a world of unseen fantasy awaits those who believe.  But this is not enough to push past the ""sermon"" that so many animated features carry these days.

The ""sermon"" in this piece is, basically: environmentalism and the evils of capitalism (disguised as little gray creatures).  Oh my.  ""Human race as virus upon the earth.""  This is a well-used platitude by those who seek to socialize us all into being wards of the state.  Sorry--a film has to be an amazing piece of writing and technical wizardry to get me past the political and religious biases of the filmmakers.  James Cameron pulled this off in ""Avatar""--another painfully amateurish political tome of his immature understanding of the current socio-political dynamics; however, he all but made you forget about this childish proselytizing with his technical and directorial film-making genius.  (The same can be said for his ""Titanic"".)

But no such brilliance exists with the film-makers of ""Epic"", sadly.  Case in point:  the one character that is supposed to symbolize moral purity and love for all things green is voiced by Beyonce.  Um--isn't she one of the most self-absorbed people on the planet? (Well, on second thought, perhaps she IS the perfect choice to voice THE QUEEN OF EVERYTHING.)  At least when Alec Baldwin voiced Santa (""North"") in ""Rise of the Guardians"" you really, really like him because he was able to put aside his ""Alec Baldwiness"" and become the character in all of the gooey-goodness without flinching.  But here Beyonce is just ... Beyonce.

Where's the director?  Where's the dialogue coach?  All I could think when Beyonce was talking is that BEYONCE IS TALKING.  Distracting and annoying.  At least her character gets knocked off early in the film.  Phew!

Epic has a plot that's easy to follow, but complex enough to keep our kids' attention with plenty of action and adventure to boot.  I would suggest avoiding it if there's been a recent loss in the family as it starts out introducing the death of a parent (very Disney of them), and that did hit a sore spot for us having lost my father and my husband's step-mother only a few months ago.

5745265,4,B00CWM7EPS,Our whole family enjoyed this movie. I think it makes the kids realize that we don't always know how other perceive us and the unseen effects that we have on others.,1379462400,,165,4.354838709677419

5745270,3,B00CWM7EPS,"Well to start off the movie was ok , My kid enjoyed it, it wasn't the greatest movie we ever saw, but it was ok. The story is where it got us. It wasn't an epic adventure. With a title like that it should have a great adventure, across all the elements , all the lands, an against all odds mission. It's ok, If there's nothing else you want to watch and have a minute, go for it. The story's not strong , it just seems like they adapted this story line from another movie and put new characters to it. I and my family just didn't get it.",1379462400,,537,3.9357798165137616

5745272,4,B00CWM7EPS,"Epic is definitely for kids.  It is not for toddlers and babies (but they will enjoy the bright colors), but more for children 3/4 and up.  Teens/Adults will get the off and on grown up 'zingers'.  Voice acting was pretty good and the visuals were nice.",1379376000,,253,4.456521739130435
5745273,3,B00CWM7EPS,"Epic is a movie about a teenage girl who finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place. She bands together with a rag-tag group characters in order to save their world.

Epic is beautifully animated with nicely detailed scenes and the movie has just enough to provide entertainment for the whole family.  There are funny moments but as far as the comedy characters (Such as the snails) go, there have been better in other movies but nevertheless they provide enough funny entertainment to keep you amused.

The story is well done but fairly predictable and treads through some of the same territory as movies past so there is nothing revolutionary or groundbreaking that will make this an instant classic.

This will be entertaining enough for the younger crowd but keep in mind there are some scenes that may be a little violent for the younger ones.",1379376000,,937,4.765432098765432

I've heard it compared to Fern Gully and such negative things said about ""environmentalists"" yadda yadda yadda.  I just found it to be a very entertaining movie that took place in the forest about tiny forest people.  We didn't look at it in any deep or profound way...or get a hidden message to ""go green"" like one of my friends said.  LOL.  It was just an entertaining movie that I'd recommend to any family.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.",1379376000,,509,4.516483516483516
5745275,2,B00CWM7EPS,"If they took half as much time fleshing out the script and improving the story, as they spent planning all the (amazing) 3D elements, this could've been one heck of a movie....
That is, IF they chose to cast the roles based on who was RIGHT (i.e., who was talented enough to make the characters ""come to life""), rather than casting based on ""Name Power""... then, this WOULD have been one heck of a movie.  (case in point: Beyonce Knowles, Amanda Seyfried, etc.)
-- Amazingly, Steven Tyler does a good job w/ his role; but the song he spontaneously erupts into, was forced & didn't do much, aside from make me want to hit fast-forward. (luckily, it wasn't long)
-- Colin did good; but Josh's character lacked substance & even a modicum of originality... being that it's a  clear regurgitation of countless other similar characters of recent years, in animation particularly. (see Disney's ""Tangled"" for example, also a 3D flick; but at least that one was pretty good.)

This may very well be the most visually appealing (animated) 3D movie to date... But because of the aforementioned, laziness, and bone-headed moves by the Studio &/or Director... That's all you're left with really: A visually stunning 3D flick, that your YOUNG children will love; but which everyone else will likely loathe, or just plain hate.

I had absolutely no preconceptions about this movie.  Naturally, I went in hoping it would be enjoyable; but I didn't think it was going to be ""the most awesome animated movie ever"", for example, so it's not like my expectations were high (or too high, for that matter). __ Also, I didn't know who any of the ""cast"" was, until the credits rolled... which is how I prefer to watch all animated movies for the 1st time.

PS: In case you're wondering, why 2 stars, instead of 1?... well... It has amazing 3D, and it's fodder for 5 to 8 year-olds (or thereabouts). __ Without the 3D, however, it would definitely only garner 1 star... So if you don't have a 3DTV... You'll definitely want to rent this, because it's not even a ""given"" that your 5 to 8 yr-old will like it without the 3D visual-experience!  (Besides, I guarantee you won't want to have to watch it over and over with them, unless you can at least have it in 3D!)",1379376000,,2239,4.638888888888889

5745282,5,B00CWM7EPS,It's a wonderful story of how easily you can miss the important things or become obsessed and lose the important things it's done in such a way that I believe both children and adults would enjoy this movie I recommend it and as always I've only had one problem with the DVD I purchased here on Amazon and it was a used DVD that had been repackaged and the supplier fixed it in less than 3 days I notified them by email they sent me a new disc out and it was from a set that I had purchased but they sent me a new disc so I've been extremely happy with the CDs and the DVDs I've purchased from here on Amazon,1379289600,,608,3.951219512195122

The movie was awkward and didn't really seem to flow right, almost like one of those movies that they have a formula for but no real heart (..add a couple of named stars, a couple goofy but loveable side-kicks, a dastardly villain and mix it all together and you have a passable hollywood hit).

Overall, not worth the time or the $4.99 and if I had paid to see this in a theater, I would have been really offended.",1379203200,,592,4.372727272727273

5745285,5,B00CWM7EPS,"""Many leaves, one tree."" It's the theme of this wonderful animated delight. Maybe it's because my family tends to believe a very similar philosophy, that we are all in it this world together, is why we all loved this movie and wanted to watch it again and again. But it's more than that that will have us adding this movie to our collection. It's the beautiful animation, fun story & jokes mixed in with the more serious over arching theme, and the just pure entertainment we all got from watching Epic.

It's also not often that there is a kid's movie that my 10yr old boy, 5 yr old girl & my husband & I all agree on. But like I said, not only did we all like it...we all couldn't wait to watch it again. Maybe we somehow saw a different movie than the nay-sayers & critics did. Who knows. But what I do know is that it was worth every penny of the HD Rental & Santa will be leaving the Blue-Ray version under the tree for our ""family gift"" this year.",1379203200,,953,4.179347826086956

I did not appreciate this since I rented the movie from you and did not pirate it off some site. Again, the lag was odd. I have rented other movies in the past without this problem.

There was a lot of humor in the film that was rather unexpected based on what I had seen in the previews. We have viewed it several times and find something new each time. I'd recommend this film for lovers of computer-animated films, and for older children (7-12, maybe). I can see how small children might get bored with the film, as it had a storyline that I don't know if they'd be able to follow, and not enough action or slapstick gags to keep them engaged.",1379030400,,557,4.214953271028038

5745365,4,B00CWM7EPS,A good light movie.  I liked this as pur entertainment.  There were no love scenes and no bad language.  There were some scenes with parent child conflict.,1378252800,,155,4.666666666666667

5745386,2,B00CWM7EPS,Epic is boring; no excitement; no fun; it could not hold a 4 year olds attention and she wanted to turn it off.  The good thing about Epic is the color and graphic art design. That's it!,1378252800,,186,4.027027027027027
5745387,3,B00CWM7EPS,"Some really great moments - and a very good set up for the good guys vs. bad guys - but the Beyonce queen was stiff and Barbie-like and the flutter minded dad routine was just a waste of time.  Really.  If he is this absent-minded and accident prone, how did he build all of his elaborate equipment, mount everything all over the woods by himself, etc.  His disconnect is too extreme to make his hard work and dedication plausible.  Also, while so much of the film was beyond detailed and beautiful to look at -  the film is made even weaker because while some of the warriors are incredibly ornate and detailed - or the slug & snail for that matter - conversely, the Queen (Beyonce) and the Judas-figure (Pitbull as a Bullfrog) - almost look like they were drawn at the last minute to match a celebrity voice and are very 2-dimensional.  The music mostly disappears in this film - which isn't a bad thing.  And except for a momentary burst into an unnecessary musical moment that fizzles out quickly (thankfully) - there's nothing in the soundtrack worth holding onto (surprising for Danny Elfman).  Some things that stood out: the concept of visibility based on a creatures wavelength/speed of existence was very clever and handled nicely throughout; the life/death battle for balance in the forest and that critters/characters could face and actual demise; and some decent song snippets (The Weepies 'Same Changes').  Worth a watch.",1378252800,,1435,4.800813008130081

5745389,5,B00CWM7EPS,"While it doesn't contain the fine attention to details as Pixar's work, this story portrayed foreshadowing not usually seen in these kinds of films. The campiness of the movie easily took away the bowl of onions near your eyes, and smooth animation, and incredibly easy to understand characters made this a great film to watch if you'd like to feel good at the end.",1378166400,,365,4.71875

5745394,3,B00CWM7EPS,"""Epic"" is a gorgeous film to watch.  The slug voiced by Aziz Ansari and the snail voiced by Chris O'Dowd were hilarious.  It's the plot that left me feeling underwhelmed.  The whole premise of why the forest is suddenly in peril and why the main character ""MK"" (voiced by Amanda Seifried"") needs to help are confusing.  Still worth watching.",1378166400,,341,4.728813559322034

5745397,4,B00CWM7EPS,"I liked this movie because it involved a lot of fantasy and was a lot of fun for the whole family.
It had magic, battles, good vs. evil, humor, and touched on family relationships.

Some of the characters reminded me of the Disney movie 'Tangled', with Flynn matching the hero the most.
However, it had enough unique and fun elements to make it a very worthwhile watch.
It was quite clever.",1378166400,,390,4.492957746478873
5745398,3,B00CWM7EPS,"This review is specifically about the 3D version of this movie. Unfortunately Amazon doesn't seem to differentiate, and just puts all the reviews together in one big jumble. That's too bad, because I actually like the movie.

The problem is that although I love 3D, it wasn't done right for this DVD. There are bits where the 3D looks pretty good. If you're not discerning about 3D you might be satisfied. The problem happens when things are in motion. The motion looks unnatural. The more motion there is, the worse it looks. There's kind of a flickery strobe effect... very distracting. I think it has to do with aliasing, but I don't know much about that technical stuff. It's not my job to know. It's the job of the people making the DVD to get it right.

Btw, there is nothing wrong with my equipment. I played the 3D version (it looked bad, as I've described), I played the 2D version (it looked fine), and I played some other 3D movies I have (and they looked fine too). Originally I gave the DVD only one star, but I watched it again and bumped it up to three stars. The 3D is watchable, and sometimes looks really good, but what I've described is real problem. If you see it in 3D for a good price go ahead and get it, I guess, if you want to satisfy your curiosity.",1378080000,,1275,4.352941176470588

We really liked the story line.  It is sort of a modern day, more exciting and detailed version of Horton Hears a Who.  I like the values it teaches like believing in yourself, following your passion in life, and of course the power and beauty of nature vs. those forces that choose to destroy it.
From an artistic standpoint I thought the animation was beautiful and the plant people were so creatively designed.  The colors and the forest setting were captivating.  The whole family loved both the animation, the characters, and the storyline.
I would recommend this film for family movie night and especially to those outdoorsy families like ours!",1378080000,,877,4.45

5745407,1,B00CWM7EPS,"O boy.  What a joyless and unpleasant experience!  The story?  A young girl is magically transported to a small world where evil creatures are trying to kill the queen of the forest.  Now then, doom awaits any movie where the viewer is constantly reminded of similar works.  Instead of being involved into this picture's tale, all I could think of was how certain scenes were like those found in ""Avatar"" (2009), ""Ferngully - The Last Rainforest"" (1992), ""A Bug's Life"" (1998) and ""Arrietty (a.k.a. The Secret World Of Arrietty)"" (2010).  There is a line between homage and replication.  ""Epic"" is a bland copycat of mediocre fantasy films and it shows.  Talk about false advertising in a title!
  COMMENTS:  {SPOILER ALERT}  First observation - I hate movies with pretentious narration.  This flick was in trouble immediately when M.K. muses that ""someone once told her"" something lofty.  Don't you hate that!  It's always ""they say"" or ""somebody told me.""  It is annoying because it is contrived.  If a character must speak to the audience, then let it be from their heart.  I don't care what someone else said and did.  If it is your story, then tell it truthfully without filters.  ""They"" can go jump in a lake.  I don't give a flying rat about ""they"" and neither should any viewer.  Imparting faux wisdom in such a timid and indirect manner is no way to capture the audience's attention.  There - I said it.  Last observation - what is with the notion that small creatures move in a faster dimension?  This is dumb.  Anyone ever kill a bug with a fly swatter?  All of us, huh?  That is what I thought.  The speed element was unnecessary, but so was the whole project.",1378080000,5,1672,4.6689655172413795

Why on earth do they draw people like that still? Big eyes, long noses, stony expressions. One can do better. One can do BETTER! The animation, the music, the story, the characters, the dialogue. Jesus! Franchise in its worst sense. Bring in some people with new ideas and visions, PLEASE. Start with the story. There must be someone out there with a good idea. Find that person!

The age difference is hard in selecting a movie, with usually a lot of pouting and compromising going on.  This was not the case with Epic.  Although a cartoon movie, the plot of the movie got their attention immediately.  The voice casting was surprising.  Although I'm not much of a fan of Colin Farrell, his voice acting was superb.  He brought the character to life without sounding forced or rehearsed.  The rest of the cast was great as well.  This movie had us all clapping for the heroes by the end.  If my kids gave it their seal of approval without a second thought, I highly recommend it.",1377820800,,687,4.520325203252033

I never have a peoblem with the streaming quality of Netflix or Hulu so this leads me to believe that it's amazon. If it wasn't going to play properly it should have never let me purchase it in the first place. Almost every time I try to stream from amazon the quality is horrible.

Animated movies just keep getting better, and while this Blue Sky outing isn't quite at the level of Up or Monsters Inc, it's pretty close. The animation is just about perfect, with incredible depth of scene and color that's a marvel to behold. The story is also good smart fun, a kids' fantasy with lots of moments to make adults smile was well.

The highlight here for me was the voicework. Seyfried and Farrell are both very fine,  but Tyler and especially Waltz really make things jump. Waltz is a perfect villain, displaying a range that most voice actors would do well to study. Tyler's comic relief is a treat, and his voice is certainly the most recognizable I can think of, like a modern Jimmy Durante. Ansari also turns in a nice comic performance.

I noted various critics pointing out that this plot resembles a few other kids' nature dramas, to which I say: great! We need a dozen times more films focusing on mankind's self-sabotaging dominator attitude to our planet. Any plot or story that helps kids relate to all life on our planet as part of their heritage and responsibilities is a wonderful and necessary thing in my eyes. Epic does it very well, I think.

Elfman's score is pitch perfect, but never draws attention to itself. It highlights every scene yet fits so well that you almost don't notice it, which in some ways is the ultimate compliment for film music. Hard to say when Elfman finds time to sleep, as he's been competing with Hans Zimmer for the title of Hardest Working Man In Soundtrack Business for many years now. Long may they both compose.

There's really nothing to not like here, and lots to love. Exceptionally family friendly and intelligent enough for movie fans of all ages, Epic provide great entertainment while reminding us about the value of the small things in Nature that we overlook every day.",1377475200,,1856,4.677914110429448

Instead, Mary KAte gets sucked into a life and death struggle between the good ""Fairies"" and the evil boggans.  The visual scenery is nothing short of miraculous and the likable characters remain funny through action scenes devoid of true violence or blood.

5745504,3,B00CWM7EPS,"Epic (well, NOT-Epic might be a little closer to the truth) Bowling for Movies Score: 147 of 300

Bowling for Movies is a score that I, just your average dude (hereafter referred to as The Movie Dude), have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula using chili dog sauce and kettle corn (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throwing too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]

Epic - we own the 3D Blu Ray combo pack

Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):
A teenage girl gets more than she bargains for when, by chance, she is drawn into a secret society of little people known as Leafmen who are involved in maintaining a sacred magical balance that keeps the forest alive.  Having been transformed into a pint-sized heroine, M.K. must help the Leafmen save the day in this fish-out-of-water story loosely based on a popular children's book.

Bowling Score Breakdown:

Strikes (what I loved)
I need to be blunt - this movie had the best CGI animation I think I have ever seen.  EVERY detail on EVERY leaf on EVERY tree was wonderfully, carefully, and lovingly placed.  The characters were rendered to near photo-realism.  I would pay money to simply have been able to walk around the forest and interact with creatures therein... wondrous to behold!  We watched the movie in 3D and here I have to tell you, the film visuals were incredible - no ghosting, no blurry side shots, simply done to perfection.  These guys know how to animate a feature film.  Academy Award level animation here.

Spares (what I liked)
Adding to the stunning visuals is a good soundtrack which isn't too surprising - when Danny Elfman is around, good music follows.  He's like, the man.

Gutterballs (what I didn't like)
I hate to say it - there were several gutterballs in this movie.  It's sad because there was so much going right in the animation department but... the story was weak, watered down, and uninspiring.  ""Epic"" is really a misnomer, the story was a bad mix of eco-warrior action, silly `unlikely friend' humor, Disney-esque dead parent sadness, and back to the action/adventure - all strung together in a ho-hum, let's get to the end already tale.  I started looking at my watch 20 minutes in which is not good because this movie had such potential.  I know this eco-warrior theme is all the rage right now but it's been done (and better).  I'd say this movie would prove interesting to kids in the 7-10 age bracket which is pretty thin.  Besides this I just have to tell you - I can remember a day when kid's movies had boy heros and those seem to be a rare beast these days.  I have a daughter (hereafter called Little Miss Movie Dude) so I am totally down with the girl lead in the story idea but it seems like we have been inundated with princess type movies for well over a decade - it might be interesting, cinematically, if Hollywood was a little more equal opportunity, just saying.  We could be doing better than this and I think it would help freshen up these 'been there, done that' stories.

Bowling for Movies is in no way affiliated with Amazon nor do I have a website or other business interest - I'm just a dude who watches movies (and dabbles in quasi/pseudo-science) :] Want me to review a movie and score it in an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it.",1377302400,12,4007,4.443228454172367
5745505,3,B00CWM7EPS,"The movie was good, had a lot of action, the down side is that they had the Main Heroine and the Main Hero build an affection for each other which would not work since in the end she is still human and he is still a Leaf guardian. They can never have a relationship together so what was the point?",1377302400,,297,3.966666666666667
5745506,4,B00CWM7EPS,"Lots of trouble with sound quality on every television we tried to watch it on.  All are HD so not sure what the problem is.  Not hearing it well really takes away from the movie.  As for movie itself, we did enjoy it!",1377302400,,218,4.023255813953488
5745507,5,B00CWM7EPS,"We missed ""Epic"" at the theaters.  But, we received the 3D BluRay yesterday on my Wife's birthday.  Five adults hovering in front of the Sharp 70"" Quatra, in the darkened room, with sunglasses.  Quite a sight.  BUT, more importantly ages 29 to 64 and we all enjoyed ""Epic"".

I tend to not over think the individual flaws of a film, but how it stands as an ensemble.  Sometimes we don't agree with the logic of the story, but in the end, is the important issue is,  was the story well told over all.  Epic qualifies for ""Story Well Told"".

""Epic's""  RIO genealogy shows though in the most positive ways.  Beautiful to watch.  Good vs. Evil, etc., and yes Good prevails.  I'm certain all of my grandchildren will love it and their parents will approve.

As other have said, the animation is breathtakingly beautiful with amazing attention to detail.  The 3D is NOT ""in your face"" but just enough to gain that extra degree of ""being there"".  It was very tasteful.  This is artful animation, not the CG live-action of Avatar.  The 3D was just right for me, and the family agreed.  The use of foreground vs back ground carried though even into the credits.  KUDOs for being true to the 3D art form.  This is a film you can forget it's in 3D until you turn the 3D off. Then you know it's missing.  Just right...

We'll watch it over and over as each batch of kids and grownups circles through the house to watch in 3D or 2D as the groups prefer.

It will undoubtedly become a ""standard"" as sure as RIO, Ice Age, Robots, and other BlueSky animated films have.  That reminds me, time to watch Robots again!

Thanks BluSky for thinking just enough out of the box.

My primary criticisms:  ""What's up with the title""?  No wonder people didn't flock to see it.  Too bad.  Don't let the title put you off.  The film could have just as easily be title"" ""Wonderful"" or ""Enchanting"", which it was for us.  My secondary criticism is the extra features are only on the 2D disk in the set.  Surely the 3D didn't take up that much extra data on the disk, or maybe it did with the exceptional detail.  Furthermore, this is a very complex project and I think there were many opportunities missed in the Extra features.  They weren't the Extras you'll tell your friends about, etc.. like those found on Shrek and some other animated films.  Oh wait!.  Maybe I just figured out why they didn't bother to include them on the 3D disk.

Balance your life.  Watch ""Epic"" with friends and family, then go out and enjoy the outdoors the Leafmen are protecting.

5745521,4,B00CWM7EPS,"Naming your very film ""Epic"" is a tall order. The word ""epic"" suggests sweeping scope, grand action, and impossible odds. But EPIC is about a race of little people 5 inches tall. It's highest stakes are the survival of a patch of forest and the size of a 16 year old girl. Is EPIC epic?

No, not really. The scope is not all that grand, the screenplay is a derivative mash of other movies (Part&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arthur-Invisibles/dp/B002MK4VVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arthur & Invisibles</a>, part&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ferngully-The-Last-Rainforest/dp/B001K8YZMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ferngully: The Last Rainforest</a>). The film lacks the inspiration and the ingenuity that makes Pixar so great, the entertaining characters of Disney, but comes up close with DreamWorks in terms of lush atmosphere and beautiful animation (Is it just me, or is DreamWorks on a roll with How to Train Your Dragon, Kung-fu Panda 2, and The Croods?). I've never really LOVED Blue Sky Studios. I mean, the first ICE AGE is entertaining, but ROBOTS, HORTON HEARS A WHO, and the ICE AGE sequels were really hit-or-miss. RIO was fun and colorful, and like EPIC, beautifully animated, but Blue Sky has yet to combine heart, humour, excellent animation, and a great plot. Still, Epic impressed me in several ways, and I will go over them below.

So those are my cons. That and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyonc/dp/B001KR5RKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyonc</a>, whose voice performance is woefully out of place.

But as I said above, EPIC impressed me. It is the most gorgeously animated, beautifully drawn, lush, atmospheric, detailed, visually stunning animated film I have seen all year. The detail put into the costumes, down to the clasps and buckles, harnesses, and jewelery is simply incredible. The characters are beautifully designed and rendered, behaving naturally and realistically. The proportions are realistic, and the animation of the lush green trees and sparkling streams will take your breath away. A small scene with a deer will take your breath away. I give the film extra points for being the most colorful, breathtakingly animated children's film I've seen in a long time.

The voicework, too, is superb.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amanda-Seyfried/dp/B00BI5IXL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amanda Seyfried</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Josh-Hutcherson/dp/B008602KQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Josh Hutcherson</a>&nbsp;are excellent as human teen Mary-Katherine (who goes by MK) and the reckless Nod. The supporting cast, which include Steven Tyler, Pitbull, and Jason Sudeikis are beyond criticism, but the two standout roles are that of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Colin-Farrell/dp/B00B7AB7TK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Colin Farrell</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christoph-Waltz/dp/B00CDT41RY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christoph Waltz</a>, who imbibe their cool characters with charisma, emotion, and energy. Farrell plays Ronin, the sword-wielding, hummingbird-flying, bottom-kicking head of the ""Leafmen"", while Waltz plays the surprisingly sympathetic and fully-fleshed villain - Mandrake.

Other areas where EPIC succeeds is the typically-good Danny Elfman score (he's never bad!), the action, in which ""Boggans"" and ""Leafmen"" fight with surprisingly real and devastating consequences, and the presence of two incredibly cute snails, who give the much-needed levity.

In conclusion, EPIC might not be as epic as it thinks it is, nor as original or inspired, but as a gorgeously animated, character-strong animated film that provides kids with good role-models and messages, while entertaining them with ""epic"" conflicts and amazing visuals...it ain't half bad!

5745523,5,B00CWM7EPS,"Ever since Toy Story these animated films have been a must see for myself and my family, kids and adults alike. The majority are family/kids films with enough adult humor in them to keep us interested, pretty much has been the formula since that first classic. Epic keeps that going, but might not be for small children, depending on your parenting style. The reason I say this is violence. Now I am not judging, I gave the movie 5 stars because it is now one of my favorites, right behind Despicable Me which is 5 stars and then some. If there was a 4.75 option I would have done that to keep it real! Unlike Despicable me this violence involves swords and arrows and the results are very feel, living things with arrows sticking out of them. One of the enemies, who are not human but are humanoid, falls to his death splatting on a car windshield like a bug....kind of morbid for a ""kids"" movie. This is not a criticism of the movie, just helping out any parents out there. I enjoyed it.

5745529,1,B00CWM7EPS,"If you have a little one fascinated by the struggle between dung and mulch, ""Epic"" may briefly hold your child's interest. Yet even young would-be botanists will find this charmless animated adventure as exciting as watching grass grow.
On the forest floor, tiny leaf-men ride birds and watch over the forest. Their queen is choosing a small bud to become her heir when the evil Boggans, who live to rot away greenery, interrupt her. The bud lands with human teen Mary Katherine, who's visiting her nutty professor dad at his cabin.
Grasping the bud as a full moon rises, M.K. is shrunk down to leaf-man size. Recruited to help leaf-man warrior Ronin and young soldier Nod, M.K. learns that every daisy, dandelion and stick has a face, as her dad suspected, and that a skeletal creature called Mandrake wants to rule the forest. A caterpillar librarian croaks out a song. An annoying slug-and-snail team provide ""comic"" relief.
It all gets massively tedious, a ripoff of Pixar's ""A Bug's Life"" and Disney's sweet and expansive ""Tinker Bell"" direct-to-DVD movies. You can hear actors plopping down to collect paychecks as they voice characters so thin they could be knocked over by a spore.
The lesson that life is ""many leaves connected to one tree"" is sprinkled on like an afterthought, just like the muddy 3-D. Even the title sounds as if no one could think of anything wittier. There's also a three-legged, one-eyed old pug dog that's meant to be ""awww!"" but comes off ""ewww!""

5745533,5,B00CWM7EPS,"This is a great animation with a wonderful plot that is full of twists and turns.

Mary Katherine (M.K.) (Amanda Seyfried-Voice) accidently finds herself in a world where tiny people exist. Once she is turned into one of them she tries to help their home, the forest, become whole again. Along the way she meets some very interesting characters. Will she get back home, or will she permanently have to live in the forest?
I absolutely love this film. It has a great plot, and some really great characters. I like how the visuals are outstanding and flawless. The 3-D animation is so wonderful that it makes this film 100 times better in making the forest come alive. The costumes really relate to where the characters are in the forest. The background music is very fitting with the rest of the film. The actors do a remarkable job portraying their characters.

I am surprised about how much I love this film. I think everything about this film is great. My favorite character is M.K., because she is very much like me, not in her situation, but the way she acts about everything. I can see myself easily relating to her. My favorite scene is when M.K. is talking to her Dad about how he is not normal and all she wants him to do is be her Dad without all the gadgets and gizmos. This scene is very touching, and teaches us that once in a while you need to be there for your loved ones, but you should also do your own thing.

Director Chris Wedge directs a fantastic animated film. Also Writers James V. Hart and William Joyce, along with others, do a good job writing the screenplay. Other great voice-over talents in this film are Colin Farrell, Josh Hutcherson and Beyonc Knowles.

A couple of messages that are in this film are: 1) Everything happens for a reason and 2) Do not take what you have for granted. Be thankful for everything that you have.

I recommend ""Epic"" for ages 5 to 16. It is really one of those films that everyone can watch and enjoy together. There is no content that is inappropriate for younger viewers. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars. It is truly a wonderful film with amazing animation and great characters. I will definitely look forward to seeing it again.

5745556,3,B00CWM7EPS,"Conceptually, `Epic' isn't anything new.  In fact, it's been compared to `Fern Gully' and `Alice in Wonderland', and I'd even add `Avatar' to the list (the flying on birds aspect seemed very `familiar').  It has a visual impact from a mere surface viewpoint, but digging deeper presents us with a film that is less `epic' than I expected.

I personally find it baffling that they would use such a title to describe this film.  The word epic carries such a connotation, such a weight with it.  People use it to describe something larger than life, something on a grand and opus scale.  When you use that word to describe your film (in something as direct as the title) you lead the audience to expect something more than most films can live up to.  It was an ill-advised move, and then again I'm struggling to come up with an alternate name that would have influenced ticket buyers.

`Save the Pod!'

The basic theme running through `Epic' is that of environmental awareness, except there is nothing tying the doomed environment to human mistakes and so it strips us of any real awareness.  The bad guys are not human beings but rather these strange amphibian looking bug things called Boggans.  These Boggans are led by the evil Mandrake who wants to destroy the forest but has been unable to because of Queen Tara and her mystical healing powers.  She is the Queen of the forest and has been able to balance out Mandrake's disease spreading ways.  Mandrake then decides to kill off the Queen before she can chose an heir, but his plan doesn't exactly go smoothly and he only gets it half right.  On the human side of things you have M.K., a young girl who just lost a mother and is forced to go live with her father who is a crazy man in the woods convinced of the little people in the trees and so he has cameras everywhere trying to get a glimpse of them.  M.K. obviously thinks her dad is crazy until Queen Tara shrinks her and gives her the heir to take care of; that heir being a pod that needs to bloom that very night.

This film is fine (my kids loved it), but for what it promises I'm extremely letdown.  The visual aspect of the film (especially in 3D) is nice, but there is a lack of dreamlike serenity here.  Everything is so obvious and almost plain.  The tiny little worlds are just so unimpressive.  Yes, the use of flowers and nature to create the alternate world is pretty neat, but everything looks and feels so anticlimactic, so uneventful.  From a purely thematic point of view, it misses the point by giving mankind no responsibility, and it loses major points from borrowing flagrantly from every other `shrinking human movie'.  They even have a wise-old caterpillar!

The love story is expected and generic, the crazy dad is a total clich&eacute; (why are all smart people anti-social and awkward) and the message is lost in the delivery.  Beyonce is as annoying in cartoon land as she is in real life, but at least Aziz Ansari and Chris O'Dowd are funny and offer up some joy in this otherwise mediocre offering.",1376524800,,3037,4.550644567219153

5745558,4,B00CWM7EPS,"Wonderful visuals make this magical universe a treat for the big and little ones alike, and are enough to want to give Epic a closer look.

Serious stuff (OK sort of)

The story itself is good versus evil, save the world and revel in the splendor of nature. But there are some great family ideas behind it as well, including honor, courage, and doing what you believe in, all of which may intrigue the hidden hero in all of us.

On to fun

I love the goofy sidekicks, and this alternate universe created in the movie is full of them. But I especially love Mub the slug, who I think steals the show.

The action and chase scenes are vivid, exciting and some of the imagery is very original and breathtaking.

Is this as Epic as the title suggests, not exactly. But it is fun, beautiful to look at, and their is some interesting ideas behind all its silliness, brave kids, larger-than-life characters and absent-minded adults that sometimes forget what being a kid is all about: fun.

If you haven't seen it, and like the idea of being whisked away to a secret, hidden world where you have to fight to save it and our world, than give Epic a look.

I just don't think small kids should see it and totally understand the PG rating. You'd think it was a light-hearted family movie, but it has tons of fighting and violent scenes. Maybe not the best thing to have your small one watching. I'd even be selective to tweens who have a habit of acting out.

5745569,3,B00CWM7EPS,"The movie wasn't that bad really, It's about some new age borderline snotty young girl who is sent to stay with her father (there is some implication that her mother has gone somewhere permanent) and ends up embarking on a highly imaginative adventure with the forest elves.

the movie villians are the people who live in the 'dead' part of the forest, they are scary enough for the kids. The father is a whiny ""nerd"" on the hunt for the elves.. he seens like a decent character.

one of the counter heroes is a young elf guy who throughout the movie courts the young lady. they kiss and then are separated by their rolls in life to become video chat partners.

.. as a whole, the movie really wasn't too bad, but it just didn't have the charm to make me want to buy the movie. The kids managed to sit through the first part of the movie, but by the end were less entertained. The art and the world the movie portrays were highly imaginative and probably alone make the movie worth watching at least once.

What really turned me off was the over all sense of the movie (the message?) and the lead girl character. I get annoyed at a certain type of people in life (I'm 32.. so not too old but not so young anymore), who are cynical and critical of the world but offer it nothing better and provide nothing to add.. I see them as downers who just are being downers because they're too scared (typically) to even try, and to possibly fail. They cover up their fear of the world by being cynical and sometimes withdrawn.. So from what I could get the girl in the movie represents this type of character. ... I know. I shouldn't be psychoanalyzing cartoon characters, but I do; because if my kids are going to watch this stuff over and over, then the character had best represent a quality personality type that I can admire, or at the very least, feel the kids can learn from.. like the classical greek tragedy heroes, or simba :)
So, the girl ruined it for me, and made the movie an about average probably not likely to become 'epic' animated story.

this movie did have a couple kind of funny parts. .. the field mice are really dangerous and they speak of chipmunks like they're dragons... it's humorous. A smile did crack on my face.

.. so that's why I would give it 3.5 stars, but err on the side of 3 stars rather than 4.
I would recommend watching it once if you have the time on your hands and like to see all the new cartoon movies. If you think you want your kids to try something new, then .. aaa.. if there's nothing else to try then go for it, otherwise, ""the rescuers down under"" is probably a better pick and currently available on the other movie app.
If you're an average adult who doesn't really go for cartoon movies except the good ones (maybe you watched shrek or something).. then you won't miss this one.",1376006400,13,2824,4.339015151515151

I had no prior knowledge of who was in the movie besides Amanda Seyfried. The voice work seemed to matched the characters pretty well. The animation looked good. The jokes were kind of juvenile, but humorous. Nothing laugh out loud. The plot was standard. It kind of reminded me of Arthur and the Invisibles or The Borrowers.

5745574,4,B00CWM7EPS,"I watched this with my husband and eight-year-old recently at the dollar theater and was pleasantly surprised at how much we were entertained. The story may not be wholly original as it blends in elements from older and more familiar stories/movies but I thought that it was a decent effort and the animation was incredibly well-done. The story focuses on a young human teenager, Mary Katherine or MK  (voiced by Amanda Seyfried) as she prefers to be known. Having recently suffered the loss of her mother, MK travels to an isolated spot to live with her father, who is a bit of a loner and eccentric. MK's father has devoted his life to discovering the existence of a group of advanced little people who appear to be related to the fae. This race of small folk is made up of a Queen named Tara (voiced by Beyonce), guards called Leaf Men led by Ronin (voiced by Colin Farrell), and who are at war with a group of bugs called Boggans led by Mandrake (voiced by Christoph Waltz).

The story deals with what happens when the little people lose their beloved leader. MK, who is at odds with her father over his single-minded pursuit of the little people, finds herself confused when a strange event shrinks her to the size of the little folk. Together with Ronin and several other characters, namely a ne'er do well and two oddball snails, the group embark on a mission to save the forest before it is engulfed in darkness and destroyed by Mandrake and his cronies.

The pacing is good throughout the movie, and none of us felt bored during the movie. To be sure, this is one of those fantasy-themed films that requires one to suspend belief for the duration, and accept the movie for what it is - a cool and interesting  fantasy movie that has beautiful animation and an engaging story that will appeal to young children and adults. Just a note though, there are some sequences in the film featuring the ugly Boggans acting in a menacing manner which might be a little scary for the very young (toddlers and under) but on the whole, there is not much to find fault with.",1374364800,,2068,4.536193029490617

I am probably being a little rough on it because I was expecting so much, but I think I am being fair.

While at times there were moments of stellar animation, there were also many times when the quality of said animation let it down.

Also true, while there were moments of great character animation; M.K., Mandrake, Mub, Grub and Nim Galuu, along with some of the lesser characters, there were also moments of bad character animation; Nod, Queen Tara, Ronin.

At times the background paintings were awesome. Then at other times they would not be much better than some T.V. fare.

The story was nothing new, almost being a combination of 'The Great Fairy Rescue', 'Fern Gully', 'A Bugs Life' and 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids'.

The slug and the snail had the funniest moments. The main bad guy was very well done, but was nothing new.

The lead character, M.K., jumped to quickly into her new world, without any shock or surprise (maybe kids in this high-tec age don't get shocked and surprised as much,).

'Nim', voiced by Steven Tyler of Aerosmith fame, was my favorite in both animation and voice, but even that character seemed stolen from 'The Wizard of OZ'.

Although I like Josh Hutcherson, the voice of 'Nod', in most things, the animation of his character let down his performance.

M.K's father was also well acted and drawn, but was to much like Rick Moranis' character in 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids' and ""Dr Griffiths' in 'The Great Fairy Rescue.""

The best animation seemed to be reserved for the lesser characters, some of which were very well done.

I was hoping the animation of the forest atmosphere would be on the lines of 'Avatar', when in fact it didn't even measure up to the 'Tinkerbell' movies.

The battles and conflicts were not epic enough.

Even with a few visual delights, I came out a little disappointed.

Daughter found parts a little scary and dark, but over all she liked it.

So, for these reasons, I can only give it 3 Mub's and Grub's out of 5",1370908800,,2142,4.524675324675325

5745585,3,B00CWM7EPS,"Current animation astounds me! I sit in the dark, staring at what I know are drawings, but feel their emotions, watch their human quirks and relate to their problems. Twentieth Century Fox and Blue Skys has collaborated on this sweet ""Epic"" that features a girl as the main protagonist. I didn't see any boys walk out, either! Everyone liked the three-legged, one-eyed Pug, which was so cute when our heroine was full sized, but terrifying when she is the size of the Leaf People...as was that cute little mouse.

Of course current movie stars like to have ""Voice Artist"" added to their rsum, so these folks did the honors:
  * Amanda Seyfried (""Les Miserables"") is Mary Katherine, a teenager who goes to the forest to live with her father. She soon realizes that his fixation with the Leaf People leaves no room for her, so she gets ready to leave but lets the dog out by mistake and our story begins...
  * Jason Sudeikis (""Horrible Bosses"") is her father, Professor Bomba, who has been on a futile, decades-long quest to prove the existence of the Leaf People. He has remote cameras mounted throughout the forest. He wears wire-rimmed glasses and has a Conan-type high-swept forelock.
  * Beyonc Knowles (""Dreamgirls"") is Queen Tara, she keeps the magical bulb, defends her people and secretly loves her guardsman, Ronin.
  * Colin Farrell (""In Bruges"") is Ronin, the stalwart commander of the Leaf People, who is trying to protect the forest from Mandrake and keep his promise to his queen.
  * Christoph Waltz (""Inglorious Basterds"") is Mandrake. Everything dies in his presence. If he succeeds in taking over the forest, the Leaf People will perish.
  * Josh Hutcherson (""The Hunger Games"") is Nod, a rookie Leaf Soldier who quits his post as soon as we meet him. He is impetuous and a little over-confident.

Ronin was particularly well-drawn and voiced; Farrell gave us enough accent to remind us that he isn't local, but it was a gentle touch. His feelings for the queen are unmistakable, but not over-stated. The deer, the mouse and the pond, all were breathtakingly life-like. Expect a LOT of aerial warfare (the soldiers ride birds) but NO blowie uppie stuff; one teeny chaste kiss but no declaration of love. The ending is appropriate and not exactly predictable.

I'm not going into the plot as that's been extensively covered in other reviews that were accurate.

I took my 13-year old daughter to the 3-D version at the theater yesterday. The 3-D was not BREATHTAKING, but there were some great scenes, adequate for a couple of jumps out of our seats. There was humor (I love Aziz Ansari) action, adventure, the obligatory good vs. evil, loss...and that's just in the ""leafman"" world. The human realm deals with parent/child detachment issues. I'll let you figure out the outcome.

Overall, it was a great movie. I didn't go in with a Pixar comparison implanted in my head. Maybe that's why we liked it. I will probably purchase this disc to enjoy at home.",1370476800,,840,4.779310344827586

He has requested that I make him a leafmen costume, hunt down any toy we can find (which is difficult, all we could find was happy meal toys!), and see it again in the theater. He has a renewed fascination with nature, and the theme of the movie seemed to resonate with him. He actually told his 9 year old brother (who enjoyed the movie too) ""we need to work together, we are different leaves on the same tree"". Truthfully, the peaceful lego building camaraderie lasted about 10 minutes, but it was lovely that he was able grasp the moral of the film.
It was a beautifully made movie, with a fun/ funny/ sweet story. Clearly, we are not as sophisticated as many of the other reviewers, but this movie definitely made an impact on my child, and honestly for that I loved it.

5745589,2,B00CWM7EPS,"Before anything else, I will give you that this movie was entertaining and the humor was effective.

BUT... the prevailing premises within the movie are really very terribly wrong.  I know some say 'well, heck... it's just a kid's movie.  What does it matter?  They watch movies about santa claus all the time!'  True.  But you need to remember that kid's are learning machines, especially as they get younger.  They are sponges which absorb nigh on everything around them, which is why raising them is a really important responsibility.

Within the film, certain concepts are given unrealistic parity.  Life is good, decay is bad.  Colorful is good.  Dark is bad.  It's kinda classic 'good vs. evil' but taken into the realm of nature where that sort of thing is essentially nonexistent.  Granted, the 'queen' character strives to keep a balance, and I suppose that's almost good... but the film wholly misidentifies the very nature of the natural cycle, and that decay is, itself, LIFE... small to microscopic living things being a crucial part of the food chain as they consume and break down things that have passed on.  It's not evil... it's absolutely necessary, and forms much of the very basis of the food chain itself.  Without it, none of us could exist.  Compounding that error, any creature that has a dark shade (crows, bats, rats, etc) are automatically slanted as corrupt as evil, and that's tragic, too.

These are simplistic and misinformed perspectives that society kinda actually has to get away from, so filling the super absorbent minds of children with it... does not come recommended.  Which is too bad because, as I'd said, the humor and writing was otherwise pretty good.  Older kids and adults who've already learned better might be able to appreciate the movie without lasting harm.",1370304000,4,1809,4.95016611295681

Mary Katherine comes home to visit her father who is considered unbalanced because he believes in said creatures. This is a special time that only happens once in a 100 years, when the queen of life gets to choose her heir...and then you guessed it. This was a puffs moment for me, but not as bad as when Aerith Gainsborough passed into the light. From here you can write the rest.

5745593,2,B00CWM7EPS,"I'm getting tired of reviewing animated children's films and saying ""it's not Pixar"" -- and it's growing irrelevant, as Pixar's last two outings were disappointing.  Nonetheless, that run from Toy Story in '95 to Toy Story 3 in 2010 -- 15 years, 11 classic animated films with a nary a dud in the bunch -- set the bar so high it's impossible NOT to compare everything else to those films. ""Epic"" wants to be classic and grand, strives to be on a level with Pixar, but falls short.  What's interesting is where it falls short. It pretty much nails the epic scenes, the big action pieces. They are exciting and graceful, sometimes approaching breathless. And it looks great, no doubt about that. But ""Epic"" crumbles badly in the in-between scenes, the ones that make the action matter.  The subtle gestures, the ticks of personality, aren't there.  The characters feel thin, like cardboard cutouts or on loan from a stock animation company.  We have the gruff protector who struggles to express his love for anybody or anything.  The reckless but talented young buck who butts heads with him, but does the right thing when the chips are down. The Abbott and Costello sidekicks (a slug and a snail.) The wise man who doesn't know half as much as he pretends to and is kind of a slob, but once again, gets it done when everything's on the line.

But the worst of the bunch is the villain.  Christoph Waltz voices the character, and that ought to be a casting jackpot - Waltz was one of the most chilling villains of recent years in ""Inglourious Basterds,"" (as well as an equally chilling good guy in last year's ""Django Unchained"") but the writers and directors of ""Epic"" have no idea what to do with him.  Frankly, I'm not sure Christoph Waltz is anything special outside of Tarantino's writing and pacing.  He excels gloriously in those slow, tortuously suspenseful, dialogue-heavy scenes that nobody but Tarantino seem to get right.

Actually, I felt a bit sorry for the bad guy, whose name is Mandrake.  He's the ruler of a kingdom of rot and decay, diametrically opposed to the kingdom of life and growth ruled by Queen Tara and her Leaf Men.  Tara is voiced by Beyonc&eacute;, who, with her distinctive urban/ ghetto accent, seems like a weird choice for Queen of the Forest, but whatever.  Early in the action, Mandrake's oafish son is killed by a Leaf Man, and apparently reproduction is extremely difficult for tiny creatures of the forest, because Queen Tara has one chance in a hundred years to produce an heir, by picking a water-lily pod and making sure it blooms in the moonlight.  So Mandrake decides to steal the pod, make sure it blooms in the dark, and thus claim the progeny as his own.  So basically, the bad guy is just looking to replace his dead son. That's not so terribly evil and villainous, is it?

The first half hour is annoying and laborious first dominated by clunky exposition and a terrible performance from Jason Sudeikis as the only big person who believes that Leaf Men exist.  He is clumsy and dorky and hare-brained; basically Rick Moranis from ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" minus any of the charisma and cuteness Moranis brought to that role.  But once all the exposition, and all the big people, are out of the way, ""Epic"" picks up steam and moves from painful to pleasing.  That's because the characters stop talking and start swooping around on hummingbirds and stuff.  It looks good, it moves great, but it somehow lacks that sense of enchantment that it so desperately needs to really succeed.  At one point (during the laborious first half hour) I found myself wishing they had just made little action figures, with their leaf outfits and saddled birds, and let the kids loose in the forest with them.  A couple of 7 year olds could come up with a fresher, more exciting and intriguing story than the one on the screen.

I'm not sure the plot even makes sense -- the more I try to write about it, the less I find I understand. To put it briefly, Seyfried gets shrunk down to leaf man size, the queen dies, the pod gets stolen, and a motley crew of adventurers set off on an epic quest to save the forest.  Life lessons are learned, young folks fall in love, relationships are restored, and long-hidden emotions are finally expressed.

There's just way too much going on here, leaving us little time to enjoy or explore the tiny world of the leaf men and their adversaries, or to feel like we know and care about the characters.  Watching it, I got the feeling that the producers and animators spent the majority of their time and resources on the action scenes, and then hurriedly wrote and drew the scenes in between them. That's not the way you tell an epic story.  That's the way you make a big, busy, beautiful but ultimately heartless and empty summer blockbuster.  To put it succintly, ""Epic"" isn't.

If you're all excited about seeing an animated flick about tiny people, let me recommend a much better movie - last year's overlooked and underrated ""The Secret World of Arrietty,"" from Studio Ghibli, creators of kids' classics like ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Spirited Away."" ""Arrietty's"" not quite up to that level, but it's a much more carefully crafted tale, and captures the wonder and magic of being six inches tall in a world made for much bigger folks.

5745594,2,B00CWM7EPS,"If there's one thing you can pretty much always count on in an animated feature, it's the often stale, incredibly predictable theme of good vs. evil.  If you take a moment to think back to the abundance of animated films you've had to endure through the years (both in adolescence and adulthood), try to find a film that was somehow different from the last.  Are you thinking?  It's actually quite difficult (even though Toy Story stands out).  For whatever reason, most everyone has an animated film that is near and dear to their heart, but it's nearly impossible to find one of these nowadays.  Is it because the classic animated films, like The Lion King or Sleeping Beauty, were a part of our childhood?  Or is it that the animation is so well done these days that plot points have been completely sacrificed?  Who needs a plot when you can just have a squirrel chase a nut, or hire A-list actor to voice another generic character?  This all brings us to the review for Blue Sky Studios' newest animated feature, Epic.

Directed by Chris Wedge (Ice Age, Robots), Epic stars the voice of Amanda Seyfried as Mary Katherine (M.K.), a 17 year old girl that moves in with her father, Professor Bomba (Jason Sudeikis) after her mother dies.  Unfortunately for M.K., her father spends his time searching for evidence that there's little bug sized people living in the forest outside his house, a world in which M.K. is quickly thrust into.  Naturally, Bomba's theory is correct, and the forest houses the protectors of the forest, known as Leafmen, along with the evil Boggans.  When the forest queen, Queen Tara (Beyonc Knowles) decides to choose her heir, the evil lead of the Boggans, Mandrake (Christoph Waltz) decides to attack.  Naturally, it's up to the queen's protectors, Ronin (Colin Farrell) and Nod (Josh Hutcherson) to make sure Mandrake's evil doesn't destroy the forest.  The voices of Steven Tyler, Pitbull, and Aziz Ansari also star in supporting roles.

Right off the bat, the character voices are pretty distinct.  Amanda Seyfried contributes well enough in her role as the lead, not to mention Josh Hutcherson was a pretty safe choice for the role of Nod.  When it comes to Colin Farrell, he's an actor that's pretty easy to identify by the sound of his voice, and it's hard not to wonder if he would have been more effective in the role of the villain, Mandrake.  Christoph Waltz is one of the most enjoyable actors in Hollywood, but he doesn't really provide that deep, dark voice that's required for a believable villain.  From there, things get pretty questionable with a handful of the other character actors who are mostly out of place and probably don't belong in this film.  There are actors and actresses in the business that simply do animation voices, but instead of using some of these talented individuals, they have to give way to pointless additions, like Beyonc and Pitbull.  Of course, I have this same gripe when I see any so-called ""talented"" musicians suddenly trying to be actors/actresses.

As far as Epic's story goes, there's very little here that hasn't been done before in regards to the development of themes.  The good vs. evil element is once again thrust upon us, as if for one second anyone would believe the animated evil-doer ever stood a chance against the bumbling, amateur protagonist.  The film has a sort of Star Wars meets Avatar vibe to it, especially with all the bird travel.  If these characters had laser guns, it would be just about on par - and oddly enough, while the soldiers typically use bow and arrows to do their fighting, the ""good"" and ""bad"" leaders both feed off of ""force -like"" powers...from the forest.

As usual, Epic is pretty outstanding animation to look at, with bright colors that are awe inspiring to the eyes, especially considering you're reading a review by a person that still holds 1929's The Opry House (starring Mickey Mouse in black and white) in pretty high regard.  In any event, Epic has its moments of humor, sadness, and excitement - all of which fits the bill of a typical animated film.  As long as the animated violence or brief moments of dark peril aren't a hang-up, this film earns an average recommendation for kids.  Adults, on the other hand, will have little to no interest in this film.
