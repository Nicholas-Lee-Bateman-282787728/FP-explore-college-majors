4887422,1,B005SW2RAG,"I am not one to be pessimistic or have a bad attitude in any way, but honestly.. I have to say that the first words that come to mind are that this DVD is a joke. With that being said, the one good thing that I can say is that it is at least entertaining and made me laugh. Sadly enough... being from Austin and listening to tons of live music for years, I cannot think honestly of a time when I have seen a worse live music show. Ringo doesn't even play on most of the songs and at least his band covers up, to a degree, his deficits. I will say that it appears that Ringo himself is enjoying it, which I have to give him credit for, but that doesn't mean that others will! When I first saw this DVD, I was really looking forward to actually to see Ringo playing live, not having heard much from him in years. I could go into more critical detail, but would prefer to just think of this DVD as an amusing entertainment experience, but for serious music lovers.. save your money!",1358726400,,979,4.104166666666667
4887423,5,B005SW2RAG,This concert features Ringo playing Beatles classics that he rarely performs live (if ever)... Don't Pass Me By and Octopuses Garden! Ive seen Ringo live several time and these great songs are left out. Considering how great they sound on this concert i hope he considers including them as concert staples. This show lacks the usual greatest hits night of the supporting band (although it has Who Can It Be Now by the Men At Work guy). Wish it included more songs from the band....their contribution is half the show! Instead you get Ringos new material which some songs are surprisingly catchy..others the usual B-side at best type songs. Sound quality and picture on this blu-ray are awesome! Loved it!,1355961600,2,704,4.875
4887424,5,B005SW2RAG,"""Ringo Starr and the Rounheads- Live"" is a 55 minute long, 14 song concert disk released by Soundstage for PBS television, WTTW 11 of Chicago. It is delightful from start to finish, beginning and ending with a Beatles song. Colin Hays (Men at Work) took to the stage as a guest artist to perform ""Who Can It Be Now"".

Among the Beatles songs executed by the group are ones on which Ringo Starr sang lead vocals as a Beatle, or for which he is credited as co-writer of the song: With A Little Help From My Friends, Yellow Submarine, Act Naturally, Don't Pass Me By and Octopus's Garden.

While a good Beatles tribute band like ""Rain"" is around to delight audiences for many more years it's special to watch a real Beatle on stage leading his own band-the real McCoy.  Audio and video quality, as well as performance are all excellent.",1341878400,,833,4.503311258278146
4887425,4,B005SW2RAG,Ringo and his band did a very nice job . The only dissapointing thing was they played for only  an hour.,1341273600,,104,3.9523809523809526
4887426,4,B005SW2RAG,"Having seen Ringo and his All Starr Band play live in Liverpool and Glasgow last June, I pretty much knew what to expect from this Blu-ray. I wasn't disappointed! Ringo plays to a formula that works a treat. He keeps the  crowd on their feet pretty much the whole time with so many hits from both Beatle days and his solo career. What a treat to see Don't Pass Me By, complete with piano introduction! The band are tight and the picture and sound quality of the blu-ray are excellent. My only disappointments are that it runs for less than an hour, there are no extras on the disc and information about the gig and musicians is almost non-existent. There is also a mistake in the credits where the band is shown as including ""Mark Har"". The keyboard player is former Crowded House member Mark Hart. An unforgivable error. Having said all that, the disc is very entertaining and recommended.",1329868800,,890,4.5625
4887427,4,B005SW2RAG,I was really impressed with this Blu-ray concert.  Ringo performed really well.  The musicians on stage were very talented and suited Ringo perfectly.,1329609600,2,150,5.478260869565218
4887428,5,B005SW2RAG,"Even though this concert is only about an hour long, you feel like you spent the whole evening with Ringo. He is very concious of the fans. He seems to always be relating with them while you watch this Blu Ray. He makes you feel like your right there along with him too. You never feel disconnected or left out. I love the way he did the UN-Encore. That cracked me up! You have to see it. I can't tell it in a way that would equal the way Mr. Starkey does it. I 'LOVED' seeing him get behind the drums for a while too, even though he also had to be the front man. Oh, and he even played the Piano at the beginning of 'Don't Pass Me By'! The band was tight and sounded great. I don't think there was a moment that Ringo didn't smile, and I appreciated that. What a showman. I HOPE I get to see him live at least once, before he decides to call it quits. He never acted like he was special, or elevated himself over the other band members. He was just being one of the guys. Although, we all know he's special,....and always will be.",1326240000,24,1031,4.034146341463415
