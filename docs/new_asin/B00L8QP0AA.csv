The only other films you're getting here are ""She-Wolf of London"" (not a great film at all) and ""Werewolf of London"", besides the actual ""Wolfman"" movie. Since ""The Wolfman"" was it's own stand alone film and the character popped up later on in the Frankenstein series, they may as well have just added this one to the Frankenstein Legacy since ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman"" is a direct sequel to ""The Wolfman"" anyway.

6475911,5,B00L8QP0AA,"Watching the entire Frankenstein Legacy Collection, a good place to start your Universal horror trek, made watching the Wolf Man collection short in comparison as there is a good amount of crossover. Both sets share the great Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man and the fun, swervy House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula movies as well as the buffoonery of Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. So what is unique to this collection is the titular The Wolf Man which manages to wring out a great amount of pathos for those unfortunate to get caught in the maw of the werewolf and his tragic path and it also includes the precursor to The Wolf Man in Werewolf of London, a quick study of greed in the veins of the Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde mythology, and She-Wolf of London which is certainly a thriller and plays with the idea of lycanthropy but isn't a monster movie in the expected sense of the word. That being said She-Wolf was a fun movie and is a quasi-sequel to Werewolf of London and though you can see the twist coming from a few miles off it is strangely satisfying, like an Alfred Hitchcock episode. The value that you get in this set certainly deserves 5 stars, especially in the Blu-ray form and with all of the extras that The Wolf Man packs (gotta check those out, many are very cool and interesting bits of old Hollywood history). While I don't find the wolf man story as compelling as the Frankenstein story, mostly because Talbots character often comes on to strong or he can be a jerk, he is still a tragic character whom you cant help but to feel sorry for (most of the time) and these films offer some unique feelings and symbolism. They give up a howling good time!",1512864000,3,1688,4.501628664495114

Be forewarned, if you own other DVDs from this collection, there will be significant overlap - you'll end up with multiple copies of ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman"" for instance.

The film quality and sound were ideal.  I had no complaints whatsoever.

As for the collection itself, I give it five stars for including two movies that aren't traditionally included in collections like this: Werewolf of London (1935) and She-Wolf of London (1946).  Neither star Lon Cheney and are therefore normally left out.  Both are nice little movies.

6475945,5,B00L8QP0AA,"I received this set for Christmas, and can't recommend it highly enough. Whereas the previous DVD set only contained The Wolf Man, Frankenstein meets the Wolf Man, Werewolf of London, and She-Wolf of London, this new collection on Blu Ray adds House of Frankenstein, House of Dracula, and Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. So if you want to see the complete story of Larry Talbot battling the Wolf Man's curse, pick this up. My only complaint with the actual movies is that House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula while having good stories don't always do the best job of giving all the Monsters enough to. House of Frankenstein's Dracula scenes are so brief, that you wonder why he's in there at all, and House of Dracula only gives Frankenstein's Monster a few brief minutes of action. Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein though, despite being a comedy and sillier movie actually probably does the best of giving all the monsters enough to do. There's also some great special features. 2 about the Wolf Man mythology, 1 about Lon Chaney, another about Jack Pierce, archives, and a commentary for The Wolf Man. Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein is only movie with special features, and they include 2 short features about Universal Studios and a commentary for the movie. This is really the way to go, if you're a fan of the Wolf Man and the other monster. There's quite enough to keep fans entertained, and for someone who grew up reading books about these Monsters and begging his parents to rent these movies from Blockbuster, this was a nice trip down memory lane.",1483056000,,1582,4.819852941176471

Picture is way beyond excellent! There are no artifacts, etc - all images as sharp as can be - contrast is perfect! I didn't like having to buy all the Frankenstein movies as well - they should have made a Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolf Man mega set (as an option) so you didn't have to have multiple copies of so many movies.

BUT the cost is low enough (and is now at $19.99 as I write this) that that's not that big a problem.

Sound was crystal clear - probably better than when it was first released. I watched this on a 4k UHD 75 inch LCD TV and the picture was basically movie quality. I find the 2 Werewolf movies without Lon Chaney Jr  (Werewolf of London and She-Wolf of London with June Lockhart) to be very interesting and well worth watching if for nothing but historical value. But I do admit that watching June Lockhart in a horror movie was a little strange.

Once again - the movies look brand new!

7 Classic Universal Pictures Horror Films from 1935 to 1948.

(okay, maybe 6 Classics, as ""She-Wolf of London"" is good but not up to the other 6 films)

Great restorations. Most from 4k restorations.

I already have 1 of these films from the Universal Classic Monsters: Essential Collection Blu-ray set
that was released in 2012
(that being ""The Wolf Man"" included in that 9-films on 8 Blu-rays set)
and
I already have 4 more that are in Universal's 8-films Frankenstein: The Complete Legacy Blu-ray set
(""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man,"" ""House of Frankenstein,"" ""House of Dracula,"" ""Bud Abbott/Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein"")
but
as a completist,
I wanted this one as well (and the price is right).

So, the additional purchase here is only for ""Werewolf of London"" and ""She Wolf of London,""
yet I like having each series completely in its own set.

I also think that Universal did a good thing for the average customer (and for those new to Classic Monster movies):
While you get many of the same films,
the average consumer and the younger or newer fan now knows which film came in what order for which monster.

Yes,
The Wolf Man is in the final 4 of the 8 Frankenstein films made by Universal from 1931 to 1948
(and, yes,
 ""House of Dracula,"" like ""House of Frankenstein"" & ""Bud Abbott/Lou Costelle Meet Frankenstein,""
 has the Wolf Man, Dracula, and the Frankentein Monster -- The first 3 Monster Rally Movies!)

Great stuff.
All the movies are fun.
Most are truly Classic in the most fun sense of the word.

All look better than you have seen before.

6475986,5,B00L8QP0AA,"Universal have reissued the Wolfman complete legacy dvd set twice now over the past 10 years ago
which you can now throw out
the 2nd dvd set reissue was crap don't why they reissued it in the first place made no sense at all
well now i guess Universal have learnt from their mistakes
and Decided to reissue all the Wolfman sequels on blu-ray for the first time ever
plus also including the original Wolfman film again when it was already reissued on blu-ray few years ago anyway
all Wolfman films are on 4 Discs in standard blu-ray case, not a fold out Digi-pak which i hate
Disc 1 is the Wolfman which is the exact same reissue as the 2013 blu-ray in 1:37:1 ratio with all the old dvd extras carried over
Disc 2 has Frankenstein meets the Wolfman, House of Frankenstein & House of Dracula all given the same new 1:37:1 HD transfers
and new 2.0 master audio mixes
the HD transfers look amazing quality hardly no Grain or Dirt 8/10, much better than the old Digital remaster versions
the sound qualities for each film are really Good aswell, 6-7/10
the extras are the usual trailers carried over from the old dvd versions
Disc 3 is Abbott & costello meet Frankenstein which is the exact same reissue as the 2014 blu-ray
Disc 4 is Werewolf of London & she-wolf of London again in new 1:37:1 HD transfers
so scrap all the old dvd versions of the Wolfman sequels
Definitely time to upgrade buy this new blu-ray legacy set worth buying, 5 stars for it",1474675200,2,1446,4.43984962406015

6475989,5,B00L8QP0AA,"What a wonderful set. Throughout the years I purchased and re-purchased these films. Now, for the very first time, all of these films are beautifully remastered. The  Wolf Man and Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein are the same as the Universal 100th Anniversary edition - the highest quality version of these films ever released. But now, add to it Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula, plus Werewolf of London and She-Wolf of London - all remastered.

I recently purchased a Blu-Ray version of Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man from France. Comparing the French Blu-Ray release to this one this release is top notch. The French release had white dots throughout the frames in the beginning and even a splice in the titles. This release is sharp and clear - free of artifacts and changes in lighting.

The worst of this collection - although still fantastic video - is Werewolf of London. Throughout the soundtrack are lots of audio pops, but still, the quality of this print compared to others is high quality.

She-Wolf of London (with June Lockhart of Lassie and Lost in Space) is another masterful release in the best quality possible. Sharp and clean, it's a great addition to the collection, although don't expect the same wolfy face you've come to expect in the other werewolf movies.

This is the ultimate Wolf Man collection. If you have this in DVD, I highly recommend upgrading to this Blu-Ray edition. You will be thrilled with the quality. Even though there aren't any extras on the Son/Ghost or the triple movie disc except for unmastered theatrical trailers, the value of such high-quality films outweighs the lack of extras.

If you're a fan of these classic film, this is a must-buy collection!",1474070400,23,1752,4.902027027027027

6475992,5,B00L8QP0AA,"More great fun from Universal and they really got it right this time!  For the first time, Universal went back to camera negatives and other early generation materials to master these films for blu ray.  THE WOLF MAN and A&C MEET FRANKENSTEIN are presented on their own platters, basically a reissue of the 2014 restorations/discs.  F'STEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN, HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, and HOUSE OF DRACULA share a disc, but have average data rates of 27-33Mbps and all look great, completely restored.  Finally, WEREWOLF OF LONDON and SHEWOLF OF LONDON share a disc, and though neither has been completely restored, they are new high def transfers with some limited work done on them.

All previous supplements are presented, as well as trailers for the new to bluray films.  You'll not be disappointed in this set.",1473897600,2,814,4.948529411764706
6475993,4,B00L8QP0AA,"I caught some flack because of my premature review of the Frankenstein Legacy Blu Ray set, stating the inclusion of several films in both that set and Wolfman set was unfair to fans. I am still a little salty about it, but finding the Wolfman Legacy set for $14.99 has certainly made it easier to swallow.

First the bad news, there are no commentaries for the sequels, this is disappointing as I think fans would like to hear some background stories for them. Also Werewolf of London and The She Wolf of London did not receive the same attention as the other films, both are improved over previous releases, but they are riddled with cracks and pops in the audio and do not have the same level of detail. This is most disappointing as they should have done all the films with the same amount of care. Besides the need to buy 3-4 films three times ( once the Dracula set comes out) to own all of the sequels, the only other thing worth mentioning is that there are no new extras.

The great news is Universal did a very good job on the newly transferred films, the sequels have never looked this good, free of scratches and defect, the sound is crisp and clear. Some have said these are 4K masters, but I doubt it, there is nothing on the packaging that indicates this, the films look excellent with minor softness in certain scenes, but this is probably due to the films themselves. Hardly looking 4K, but I really don't care, these films are very old and they look better than ever. A plus is all of the bonus content has been carried over so discarding your DVD sets or selling them for a few bucks won't bother you.

The first disc holds the Wolfman with all the extras ported over from the first Blu Ray release. The second disc holds three films, Frankenstein Meets and the 2 house films. This isn't so bad as the films run around 70 minutes each and there are only trailers included as extras. The trailers look better than ever, but naturally show some wear and tear. It would have been better if they split the films up two to a disc, but I think the reasoning behind this was that they used the individual release of A&B meet Frankenstein for the third disc which includes the extras from the original Blu Ray release.

Discs four holds The Werewolf of London and The She Wolf of London, as I stated earlier in my review, both films look better than previous releases, but haven't been fully restored like the other films. Again Trailers are the only extras included. The case is attractive if not a bit familiar, but overall I am surprised that Universal delivered somewhat here.

I will wait to buy the Frankenstein set as I only need two films included in it, I am hoping to see it for the same price as this one $14.99 or $19.99. Then next year maybe Dracula and Mummy sets will follow, with The Creature and Invisible Man sets to come shortly after. If Universal keeps the price point low, no one will mind all the extra copies of these films, but if history has told us anything there will surely be a 30 film Blu Ray set around the corner.

If those four will do it for you, either the Wolf Man set or the Frankenstein set will do. But if you want Werewolf of London or She-Wolf of London, you'll have to go with the Wolf Man set; if you want Son of Frankenstein or Ghost of Frankenstein, it's the Frankenstein set. To me, both She-Wolf of London and Ghost of Frankenstein are throw-aways, but the spooky, atmospheric, and neglected Werewolf of London is well worth having on Blu Ray, and so is Son of Frankenstein, with its great cast, especially Bela as Ygor. So I guess I'll have to buy both sets. I don't like the duplication, but at these low prices for Blu Rays, I can't complain.",1469577600,11,1187,4.711538461538462

This product has four DVDs with seven monochrome dramas from the 1930s and 1940s. The first DVD has the The Wolf Man and other features. The second DVD has Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman and House of Frankenstein. The third DVD has House of Dracula and Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. The fourth DVD has Werewolf of London and She-Wolf of London. These movies are digitally enhanced and better than the older versions. The legends of a man who turns into a wolf go back thousands of years among many nations. This change only happens at night, the mans family was unaware of this condition. When killed the werewolf resumed his human form. Scriptwriter Curt Siodmak was credited with inventing many legends about werewolves and vampires. The Abbott and Costello movie is a comedy.

The Wolf Man (1941) follows the legends. I wonder if this present 70-minute film was cut back from a longer running time? A talbot is a breed of dog. Are werewolves a type of serial killer? Some said these cyclical predations symbolized the economic cycles and the depression that plagued the world.

Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1942) is another example of a sequel that follows a successful movie. Lon Chaney Jr. continued as the werewolf while Bela Lugosi played the part of Frankensteins Monster. There is a musical number for entertainment.

House of Dracula (1944) tells how Baron Latos asks to see a cellar room. Can Dracula be cured? A doctor prepares anti-toxin for Lawrence Talbot. Can Frankenstein be revived? Can a united people destroy this monster? Only if buried under a pile of rubble! Sunlight provides a cure for Baron Latos.

Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) tells about crates sent to the House of Horror from Europe. These are the remains of Frankenstein and Dracula. Larry Talbot calls to warn them! There is comic action and confusion along with the threats from monsters.

Werewolf of London (1935) was the lesser known predecessor of the werewolf films. It is a dramatic story, like a morality play, that warns about human pride that leads to dangerous knowledge. The story about a dependency on a rare flower could symbolize addiction to a rare substance. It has a romantic triangle to add to the drama.

She-Wolf of London (1946) is the runt of this litter. It is more psychological than scary, but worth watching once. Near the end there is a surprise, it is not what you were led to expect. Both June Lockhart and Don Porter starred in the television shows of the 1950s.",1436918400,36,2546,4.866050808314088

I don't quite understand the tendency to claim that Curt Siodmak made up all of the classic werewolf legends used in movies, that appears in commentaries in this collection and in the booklet that goes with the box set of all the legacy monster collections. How can Curt Siodmak, who wrote the screen play for THE WOLF MAN, be described as inventing the idea of turning into a wolf when the moon is full and becoming a werewolf after being bitten by one when these concepts appear in 1935's WEREWOLF OF LONDON which appears in this same collection? The idea of silver bullets killing both werewolves and vampires is in folklore preceding THE WOLF MAN according to various sources I've seen. To me it seems much more likely that Curt Siodmak made some obscure legends about werewolves more well known than that he made them up from whole cloth.",1423785600,,903,4.614906832298137

8664463,2,B00L8QP0AA,"Let me explain why I only gave this collection 2 stars. I have most of the Legacy Collections so jumped at the chance to to add thw Wolf Man films for my collection. Don't get me wrong, I love what's on the 3 discs. Yep, 3 not 4. Disc 4, which has ''Werewolf of London'' and ''She-Wolf of London'' were missing. I thought it odd that the case had 3 holders (or whatever you want to call them) that included 3 discs and 5 films. It's a common practice for manufacturers to ""stack"" more than 1 disc on top of another, but that wasn't what I received. This was a new, sealed packaging so the omission had to be the fault of the manufacturer. Sadly, I purchased this collection in May, but just discovered it now (hey, I've got well over 1,000 dvds and blu-rays so there's a lot to choose from). If all 7 films that's advertised (for lack of another word) had been included, I most definitely would have given this Legacy Collection 5 stars.",1532822400,,937,4.299435028248587

I watch these films every Halloween season. Unfortunately, if you have other Universal Monster collections you'll notice a little overlap between the sets, since the later films are all ""battle royale"" films featuring multiple monsters. Pop some popcorn, dim the lights and get ready to howl at the moon!",1523491200,,444,5.095890410958904
