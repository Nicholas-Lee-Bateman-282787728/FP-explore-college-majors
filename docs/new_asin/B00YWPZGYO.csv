8719308,3,B00YWPZGYO,"The Wisdom of Friends DVD originally included an episode of the TV series, The Hidden Canyon, that was not available on the only 6 DVD releases of the series. Each DVD release included 4 episodes each, totaling 24 episodes. But there were 26 episodes produced and aired, so The Hidden Canyon being on The Wisdom of Friends DVD was a big deal as it was the 25th episode released, leaving only one left to be seen. However, this multi-feature does not include this episode as a bonus feature, or any bonus features. While having 4 films in one standard sized case is very convenient and space saving, the exclusion of this tv episode is disappointing.",1453593600,,649,4.6521739130434785
