2465147,5,B000CIF3U2,"Thoroughly enjoy this DVD.  I use it time and time again to practice the different techniques Bob Ross teaches for skies, landscapes, trees, etc.  This DVD helped me be able to learn how to paint each item (background, mountains, trees...) so that I could create my OWN work of art!",1286409600,6,282,4.62
2465148,5,B000CIF3U2,"After seeing Bob's lessons on TV, I bought this one for my daughter, she loved it. Bob made painting seem so simple. Great buy, and great artist.",1285632000,16,145,4.407407407407407
2465149,5,B000CIF3U2,"It helps to love painting when considering this dvd, but Bob Ross was one of the icons of our time in oil painting!  Even if you use other media other than oil, much of his guidance and tips with color and brush stroke apply universaly. He is a fountain of information and anyone who remembers this kind and gentle individual; who uses a mixture of teaching and storytelling to infuse confidence to pickup a brush into his audience/pupils should spend the time and money on his dvd. I have only positive praise for this dvd and Bob Ross himself who; like many, had left this world too soon.",1280361600,47,590,4.462962962962963
2465150,5,B000CIF3U2,"Bob Ross showed such joy in his process and such fun in oil painting. It's amazing to see his work mostly created with what looks like a two inch house painting brush!

Great for beginners and something even for the more advanced.

It is more about his own individual technique but what fun.",1280188800,5,291,4.471698113207547

2465152,5,B000CIF3U2,"As a Bob Ross student, and now a certified instructor, I have learned a great deal from this 3 hour DVD. I think it is important as a teacher of this technique to get it right, and this DVD tackles several elements in Bob's paintings...sky, water, trees, and more. I recommend it to all of my students, and believe that anyone who is serious about painting like Bob should own this DVD. It is positively brilliant and the best forty bucks you'll ever spend on art instruction.

She loved it. The only downside is my wife and daughter immediately spent about a hundred bucks on more painting supplies. Oh well; I suspected as much. Anyway, bob's style is still great to watch and my daughter is really in to watching and trying out the techniques.

2465207,5,B000CIF3U2,"This is the Bob Ross so many of us watched on PBS and loved for years.  The Bob Ross that got the biggest kick out of pounding the terp out of his brushes.  The Bob Ross that left us far too soon.  I was so happy to receive this DVD and to once again be entertained while also learning technique from one of the nicest talents ever!  I had a mountain of VHS tapes I taped while watching his show.  Of course, tapes are no longer viable so what an asset to be able to buy DVDs.

Of special note:  one reviewer mentioned not being able to play this DVD on his Apple, so I emailed his site re this issue.  They responded that the DVD would not play on MACs.  I decided to give it a try anyway and it does indeed play on my MAC.  I have a late 2011 MacBook Pro and the DVD player is excellent (as is the computer itself!).  I don't know which MACs won't accept this DVD but my recommendation is to give it a try especially if you have a newer MAC. For those of you with smaller laptops which do not have a DVD drive, Apple makes an external DVD player which can be hooked up to the laptop.  Of course, most of you probably already knew that but just in case thought I'd mention that.

I'm so happy to have Bob Ross in my home again and fully intend to buy additional DVDs now that I know I can play them.  Why is it that so many talented people leave us way too soon???",1434844800,8,1365,3.934306569343066

2465209,5,B000CIF3U2,I love the series and this instructional DVD breaks things down so you can easily follow directions.  The nice thing is you can stop it and test things out before starting the DVD again so you can really learn his fantastic techniques.,1433548800,,235,4.595238095238095

One of the most important things I learned is to use oil paint along with a white primer on your canvas.  That is how you get the effects Bob creates.  Acrylics just don't work for me.
In this DVD, you will learn how to create mountains, waters, trees, skies, and how to fix commonly made errors.  I can't brag on this DVD enough.  It is a must have for every beginning painter.",1389398400,3,487,4.366666666666666

 You get this for your money:

1. skies (I believe there are 6 different skies to paint in oil)
2. mountains ( 4 different mountains to paint in oil)
3. trees ( 6-8 different trees to paint, including Evergreen, Pine, and Birch trees). There may be more trees in this DVD?
4. water ( I believe the are 6-7 different types of water).
5. A complete landscape oil painting from the beginning to the end (this is the last demonstration in the DVD)
6. Snow on the mountains, mist, fog in the air, and a winter look.

2465289,5,B000CIF3U2,"As a digital painter and one of Bob's (many) fans, I decided to check this out from my local library when I saw it there a while back. This is one of the most informative, detailed, and simple-to-follow tutorials that you could ever ask for. He doesn't talk about creating complete paintings in this one, but rather how to create the various parts that can make up a landscape painting: trees, rocks, water, etc. He devotes a whole canvas to about six different versions of whatever subject he is covering in that segment. So you get some good repetition to drive the info home, but also variation to build on the previous knowledge. I think this is the ideal way for beginners to start, because they aren't going to be trying to paint a whole complete painting at first, just getting down the skills necessary to paint the individual elements.

But even if you take all the incredible content out of consideration, what makes Bob TRULY amazing is this: He makes you want to watch what he's doing, you get excited about it, it makes you happy, EVEN IF YOU AREN'T A PAINTER. And he makes you feel like you could pick up a brush and instantly start painting fairly well. How amazing is that?? He was truly a warm, gifted teacher and if you are even thinking of learning to paint, buy this DVD.",1380412800,4,1291,4.493617021276596
