Sadly though we actually turned off the third film in the box set `going berserk` as even john candy couldn`t make this film funny,it was awful.",1217289600,,308,4.722222222222222
2868501,4,B000RJO564,"These three classic John Candy movies is a great buy, I bought it mainly because of Uncle Buck, my favoritte John Candy movie ever.

2868503,5,B000RJO564,I find John Candy to be hilarious.  It is great to watch him on state of the art media production,1207008000,,97,3.85
2868504,3,B000RJO564,"Individually they are about a 2, a 2.5 and a 3.....apparently folks forgot to divide by 3 when they arrived at their ratings.

When you do divide by three, you get three rather forgettable films. In 1992 I had a Shakespeare class, and the teacher wondered why John Candy had not yet played Falstaff. We will never have the chance to see that, but in these 3 films we get an idea of what might have been. But not much of an idea. There is a lot wrong with these films; I'll not go into detail. Cheap sets, bad acting, lame and intensely predictable plots, terrible special effects, Dan Aykroyd, weak direction, and the cloying schmaltz factor that nearly inspires gagging are present in varying quantities.

Uncle Buck is the most famous of these, and justifiably. Though it is interesting that a cast of nobodies surrounds him. Going Berserk is not an unknown gem but a small film that feels like a small film. And The Great Outdoors has very little great about it. All mediocrities, lifted to whatever joy they reach by Candy's boundless skill and joyous characterizations.

So yes, Candy was, I think, a genius; or at least a remarkable comic. But his poor choice of scripts, and the speed with which these turkeys were churned out, never gave him a chance. There are lots of individually excellent scenes throughout, and he is solely responsible for just about every good thing here. I am not sorry I bought this package; but it's hard to imagine they will get much use in the next 50 years of my life.",1202515200,3,1505,4.566666666666666
2868505,5,B000RJO564,"I bought this set because of the reviewer who said that ""Going Berserk"" was the funniest John Candy movie. I didn't know anything about this movie, but took his word for it. I'm glad I did. It's hysterical - the big plus is that Eugene Levy's comedic genius is equally evident in this film - I have been chuckling about his ""anger problem"" ever since I watched it last week. The video-ing of the wedding is not all that far off from some of the wedding videos I've been forced to watch - very very funny movie.",1194739200,30,510,4.268041237113402
2868506,5,B000RJO564,"I don't even know how I came across it or why, but one of my favorite movies of all time is John Candy's 'Going Berserk'. I'm sure not many people remember this one since it probably got limited release, but it's packed with non-stop comedic genius.

John Candy, along with fellow SCTV alumni, Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy star in this 1983 comedy centered around 'regular joe' John Bourgignon,(Candy)who's about to marry Nancy Reese, a congressman's daughter. Days before the wedding, John, who makes his living between drumming and limo driving, is  hypnotized by one of his fare's, a big time cult leader, Rev. Sun Yi Day. The reverend plans to have John kill his 'would be' father-in-law, Ed Reese, on his wedding day, but John doesn't take to the mind control and begins to act like a moron whenever subliminally prompted to kill.

One of Candy's best comedic works of all time! If you like those classic 80's comedies, you won't wanna miss this one. 'Uncle Buck' and 'The Great Outdoors' are what most people will be getting this set for, but for me, it's 'Going Berserk'. Love it!! Oh and wait till you get to the 'I'm alone' part. Well, shucks, I guess every guys been there, huh?",1189641600,48,1188,4.647619047619048

When Candy died shortly before the Oscars, they did a tribute to him, saying they'd show a short clip from a little known film.  I knew it'd be this one, & I knew it'd be the clip when Candy holds a bag of groceries with one hand while his co-escapee, to whom he's handcuffed, gets down on the other side of a partly locked door.

I've used this to cure people who were terrified of oral surgery the next am--80 mins. of total distraction (the movie, not the wisdom teeth).

The 3rd movie in this collection, Going Berserk, was just plain awful.  It seemed like they made it up as they went along with alot of very juvenile  jokes about certain male anatomy.  It was just plain stupid. John Candy was just too talented for the likes of the movie Going Berserk.  I recommend this DVD because of the first 2 movies, Uncle Buck and Great Outdoors.

2868584,5,B000RJO564,How can you beat John Candy's comedic talent? What a loss to the world when he passed at such a young age. So wonderful to watch his movies where he continues to give us the gift of his talent and the opportunity for a good belly laugh.,1243900800,,236,4.042553191489362
2868585,4,B000RJO564,"John Candy is one of my favorites. This movie package is a bargain. Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors seem to play all the time on TV but it is Going Berserk that makes the trio. Not sure why it doesn't get the play time but I laugh everytime I watch it and the other 2. Set is even better when watched with family. When I introduced these to my niece(10yrs), she wanted to keep them.",1236038400,5,384,4.065789473684211
2868586,5,B000RJO564,"This pack of DVD's are so hilarious.  My husaband and I love the older movies b/c they are so much better than the new releases.  John Candy is so funny in all three but our favorites are Uncle Buck and the Great Outdoors, but Going Berserk is also very funny.  Definatley worth the money.",1235520000,4,289,4.314814814814815

8201017,4,B000RJO564,"I mainly purchased this for Uncle Buck, one of my favorites! It has light humor, with a moral lesson for all! Wow! Comedy and a lesson? I'd say this movie is recommended for today's teens, even life in the 80""s was tamer then now!! Maybe if family's watched more movies with lessons, they could learn something, and be less inclined to get into trouble. John Candy was fantastic!! He's greatly missed!!",1490745600,,402,4.676056338028169
