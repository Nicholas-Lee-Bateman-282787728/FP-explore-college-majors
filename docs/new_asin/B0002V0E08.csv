Even though the condition said new the Aladdin disc had some severe scratching with minimal scratching on Return of Jafar and King of Thieves. However I watch all three discs and they played fine without any problems so I'm happy. Also all three movies came with the shiny slipcovers for the dvd cases which was pretty cool for display purposes.

2521854,1,B0002V0E08,"I love these movies. However, this set in particular is terrible. All three movies were skipping and freezing from the first time they were ever played.

None of them will play on my DVD player, despite being labeled DVD's. They WILL play on my PlayStation 3, but only after making a terrible sound  when they are inserted. No other DVD's that I own have this problem. They are not scratched or warped, but they are riddled with problems.

Buy the movies, but not this specific set.",1423612800,7,482,4.5813953488372094
