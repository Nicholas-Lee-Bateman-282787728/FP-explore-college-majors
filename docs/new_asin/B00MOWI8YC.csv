I never got anywhere near a cardio or fat burning zone. If you are at an intermediate level or above, look elsewhere. I retuned this one and the other one promptly!",1473465600,,415,4.473684210526316
8673487,5,B00MOWI8YC,"I've been a 'home workout person' for many years, and have many DVD's that I use regularly. I ordered Dasha's programs (all of them) with the intention of having a sexy body at the age of 42. And I'm here to tell you that the sexy body is showing it's way through. I'm not one for doing the 'before and after' photos, it is more about how I feel when I look in the mirror and how my clothes fit. I can honestly say that if you put in the work and just do it, carve out the 45 minutes or so, you will get results. My boyfriends eyeballing me never hurts either..... Go for it girls!!",1435190400,3,582,3.982905982905983

8673489,5,B00MOWI8YC,"I am doing this program for the second time and I absolutely LOVE IT! It teaches you how to properly cleanse your body without having to live just off of juices. It teaches you to use proper nutrition and exercise to cut weight and get leaner within a safe 7 day period! The best part is that there is a 30 day follow up to teach you how to continue to live life more cleanly so ensure future and further success. My most favorite part, is the extent to which the nutrition guide and tables are written. Everything is very clear and categorized, and there are also sections for those like myself who are vegetarians or vegans! This is a must try program- AND the nutrition book is in .pdf form on one of the discs so its eco-friendly.",1428537600,6,734,4.287769784172662
8673490,5,B00MOWI8YC,"I never believed in any of those ads with before and after pictures - but with this DVD set you will end up with exactly those fake looking before and after photos. BUT THE RESULTS ARE REAL! You have to follow the program (meaning be consistent), which isn't always easy, but so worth it.
You don't need anything to do the workouts - just a little bit of space, between 30-50 minutes of time, and possibly a mat. The exercises might be a tad confusing in the beginning, but you'll get the hang of it in no time. Every workout has a mix of cardio and strength training, so you work your entire body in every session. Make sure you also follow the nutrition guide. I didn't know anything about nutrition, but the guide lets you know what to look for in foods, how to combine them, and how to make healthy meals with simple dressings for example, or healthier ways of preparing them.
I highly recommend the DVD set to anybody who wants to get in shape, physically as well as mentally (and doesn't want to pay a fortune for going to the gym).
To me, the most amazing thing was, that I didn't only tone my muscles, and lost weight, but I got a lot leaner, which I didn't think was possible - but it's true, just like the title suggests!",1428451200,7,1231,4.28755364806867
