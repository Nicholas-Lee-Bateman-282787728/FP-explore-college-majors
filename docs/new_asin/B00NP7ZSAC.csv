8679630,5,B00NP7ZSAC,"This DVD covers the history of the Kankakee River Marsh origionally located in Northwest Indiana.  It was HUGE, rivaling the Everglades in size.  The hunting and trapping of animals and birds was renowned.  Titans of Industry, Presidents and the Royalty of Europe traveled here for the hunting.  This took place in the 1800's.  In the late 1800's efforts began to carve canals to drain the Marsh, origionally by hand.  The advent of steam-powered dredges proved to be the game-changer.  By the early 1900's the Marsh was reduced to a tiny fraction of it's glory.  In return, very rich farmland was created.  (and money was made)  The wildlife was affected with many species eliminated from the area.  This DVD does a most excellent job in words and old photos of the early history and transformation of the Grand Kankakee Marsh.",1424044800,14,828,4.884892086330935
