8674900,5,B00MVIYOFG,"The brooding animation is a perfect match for the dark, character-driven narrative. Gary Numan's soundtrack is (arguably) some of his very best work. Highly recommended.",1480982400,,169,5.8
8674901,5,B00MVIYOFG,"I'm a huge, huge Gary Numan fan, and the score is probably the best-fitting score to any animated movie I've seen. Very supportive and powerful.
The movie itself was very engrossing, and scary as hell. It's visceral in a very calm way. Absolutely not for kids. Good luck sleeping if you watch it at night.",1458000000,,305,4.5636363636363635

8674903,5,B00MVIYOFG,I thoroughly enjoyed this animated film. The Gary Numan  soundtrack was a perfect companion to the dark and bleak mood set by the film. I thought the animation was stunning. This is certainly not a film for evryone though.,1436832000,,222,4.6923076923076925
