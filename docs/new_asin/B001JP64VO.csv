3658913,5,B001JP64VO,"One of the best Canadian-made movies ever made. A gripping, sometimes humorous tale, about the true story of a teacher in a one-room teacher in Saskatchewan during the harshest years of the Depression of the 1930s. Every teacher will enjoy this one with its humorous and various incidents.",1387756800,,289,5.041666666666667
3658914,5,B001JP64VO,"This DVD was a gift. The recipient asked for it specifically, having been unable to get a copy where he lives overseas. He is very happy with it.",1377129600,,145,4.214285714285714
3658915,1,B001JP64VO,"I was so looking forward to seeing this film again after many years, but the quality of transfer to DVD is very poor. It is like watching a cheap pirate videocassette in 1981. I literally cannot see what is happening on screen at some points. I have yet to finish watching the film.",1370736000,3,282,4.339622641509434
3658916,4,B001JP64VO,"Based on a true story, this lovely film is only available in this fairly poor quality recording - but that takes nothing away from the tale.  Innocent young man goes to deepest country Canada from Toronto in the 20's to teach at the village school.  He encounters harsh conditions that are really beyond his imagination.  The dower community treat him in the same hard way they treat each other.  Nevertheless he succeeds to complete his 1st year - and we are told at the end he goes back for two further years. I laughed and cried and really enjoyed the film.",1342656000,2,560,4.514851485148514
3658917,2,B001JP64VO,This is a lovely film which I first saw years ago.  I was very excited to see it was now available on DVD.  However prospective buyers should know that the quality of the transfer is extremely poor.  Neither the picture nor the sound is to an acceptable standard.,1316304000,3,263,4.4375
3658918,1,B001JP64VO,"This is a wonderful film.  Even after reading the warnings from other viewers, I sent for WHY SHOOT THE TEACHER thinking I could deal with it's imperfections but found I couldn't.  It's of such poor quality, I had the stop watching after a few minutes, it was just too distracting.  Pity, it's a film that deserves to be in every serious DVD collection.",1308700800,,353,4.571428571428571

8313221,5,B001JP64VO,"A classic storey set on the Canadian prairie. Not for everyone, but I enjoyed it. Highlights the misery of northern life during the 30's.",1458345600,,137,4.75

8313225,5,B001JP64VO,"The movie was excellent....seems it had been copied from a VHS format as the start of the movie, it had the usual VCR imaging lines
going thru it...other than that is was a good movie, and brought alot of fond memories",1417478400,,218,4.341463414634147
8313226,3,B001JP64VO,It was an interesting story but a little long drawn out Bert cort Also known as bud Cort I like them and other movies such as mash still entertaining movies,1408147200,,156,4.233333333333333
8313227,1,B001JP64VO,I was disappointed in this movie. It didn't have much story development and it moved very slow. It didn't provide enough to hold my interest,1402012800,,140,4.64
8313228,4,B001JP64VO,"I enjoyed this film, not so much for the acting and story as for the setting of Saskatchewan even though it was filmed in Southern Alberta.  It brought back lots of memories of the one room school, poor heating,  strict discipline, the strap and single teacher falling in love.  All very common.  Very accurate depiction of life on the prairie.  A couple of Nobel prize winners and many successful people came out of such an education.",1395100800,,435,4.671052631578948
