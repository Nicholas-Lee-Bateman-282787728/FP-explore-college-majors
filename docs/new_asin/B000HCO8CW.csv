8277817,4,B000HCO8CW,"""Pleasure Chateau"" is another one of those Peach faux-movies that in reality is no more than a bunch of vignettes VERY loosely strung together with a watered-down plot element.

Honestly this one is pretty weak until the final 15 minutes or so. Two of the  final three scenes are VERY hot and very revealing (i.e. substantial graphic nudity by star Erika Jordan and a couple of other hotties). Take away those three scenes and this one is a slightly-below-average feature, because the other vignettes are pretty tame and listless.

Fortunately for us, they are in there and it wouldn't be fair to judge this as if they are not.",1304208000,5,627,4.73394495412844
8277818,2,B000HCO8CW,Save you money boys and girls....watch Max at night for a better show and more nudity.  What ever happened to the gal (with the fancy car) that rang the door bell?  I wonder who are the people that finance this junk?,1185321600,5,216,4.2439024390243905
