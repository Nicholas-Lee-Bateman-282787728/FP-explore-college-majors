8532513,5,B008YGG83K,"This children's DVD is outstanding.  Our children are great fans of the English martyrs, and one of my sons is named after St. Edmund Campion.  He is so proud of his Saint.  We have purchased numerous videos from this company, (Mary's Dowry Productions) and have been delighted with all of them.  We love having them in our library.  Especially charming is the fact that the videos are produced by one family: several talented young adults, and their parents.  Everything is produced on a shoestring budget, and family and friends are used to play the parts.  The music is truly beautiful and composed and played by one of the young women in the family.  I heartily recommend this DVD to anyone.",1353283200,,695,4.733333333333333
