5742146,5,B00CV1PFTC,"A great adventure trip into darkest Africa., with two great actors of the 1950's, Susan Hayward (With a Song In My Heart) and Robert Mitchum (Night of the Hunted)  A movie that had everything, adventure, murder, greed, romance and you need to see it.",1380758400,14,250,4.681818181818182
5742147,5,B00CV1PFTC,Susan Hayward and Robert Mitchum make this DVD worth having. They are both top-notch stars that hold your interest throughout the movie. The acting makes it a five star movie plus it is one of my favorites. I remember seeing this movie at the theater. Susan Hayward is one of my all time favorite actresses. The DVD print is as good as I expected it to be packaged in a durable case. I recommend that you spend some time with the witch Dr.,1379721600,19,439,4.301204819277109

5742149,3,B00CV1PFTC,"This is a beautiful color DVD from Cinema Archives. I am a true Susan Hayward fan, but this is not one of her best. It is predictable from beginning to end with very little adventure. It may be set in Africa, but unlike ""Mogambo"", the stars never left the Fox studios. Stock footage was used and nothing very exciting at all.",1370304000,7,325,4.344262295081967
5742150,5,B00CV1PFTC,"Saw this movie when I was a child and it stayed with me. However, as an adult, I searched everywhere for it before finally finding it at Amazon. Love this movie. Who wouldn't? With the beautiful Susan Hayward and the handsome, Robert Mitchum, how can you go wrong? It is one of the few good jungle movies Hollywood ever made, beautiful color and a great storyline. Since I now own my very own copy, I'll be watching it again real soon. And if you love jungle movies with a hint of romance and the animals you'd expect to see in Africa, then this is the movie for you too.",1454284800,3,571,4.247706422018348
5742151,5,B00CV1PFTC,I enjoyed seeing it. It brought back memories since it was my my first part in a movie!,1444694400,,87,3.888888888888889

5742153,1,B00CV1PFTC,"I was twice sent this White Witch Doctor DVD that said: ""Play Prohibited.  Check Disc"".  You would think that after sending me the first one that the second one would be checked before it was sent out.  I was so disappointed.  This was not a cheap product.",1440201600,,256,4.382978723404255

5742158,5,B00CV1PFTC,Good story.  Wonderful picture with Susan Hayward and Robert Mitchum.,1420416000,,69,5.9
5742159,3,B00CV1PFTC,"In their second and final screen pairing, Robert Mitchum and Susan Hayward make the most of Technicolor Africa in ""White Witch Doctor"" (1953). Star power carries the day, with a strong assist from cinematographer Leon Shamroy and composer Bernard Herrmann. Director Henry Hathaway's jungle adventure is no match for John Ford's ""Mogambo,"" but it's palatable B-movie hokum on a big budget.",1416182400,5,388,5.377049180327869
5742160,2,B00CV1PFTC,"In spite of two stars that I like, this is an awful movie. Boring and slow.",1413244800,2,75,3.75
5742161,5,B00CV1PFTC,"I have been literally searching for this film for well over a decade. I have been informed so many times that it was out of print so naturally, I was ECSTATIC to find it!!!

5742164,4,B00CV1PFTC,I was delighted with this DVD!  I saw it years ago and loved it but have never seen it become available until now.  I loved it even more. And it was even in technicolor. I'm a huge fan of Susan Hayward.,1407369600,5,202,3.902439024390244
5742165,5,B00CV1PFTC,I love Susan Hayward.  I am glad to see they are bringing more of her movies out so we can buy.  I am not sure if I remember this movies.  I wish others who have have this would give more details.  Who are the other actors in the movie.  I loved this movie if it is the same one I saw.,1401926400,,285,3.6065573770491803
5742166,5,B00CV1PFTC,"There are tose Susan Hayward moments all through this,and Robert Mitchum is here to help[ stabilize this incredible story, with not a bit of verisimilitude. Nonetheless you get lines like this:

Robert Mitchum to Susan H as she approaches the studio shores of the Congo: Mitchum to S.H. ""Watch out. Everything comes down
here for a night cap.""

Susan H. to the skies above as she operates. ""God help us!!""

It all works and is fun and interesting to see these two greats of the cinema wrestle with this tale and take you in. Don't miss it..",1401753600,6,540,4.546391752577319
5742167,5,B00CV1PFTC,"I've always liked Robert Mitchum movies and remembered seeing this one many years ago.  I gave it 5 stars because it deserved it.  Just enough danger, a little hint of romance, kept me interested and I know I'll watch it time and again, now that I own a copy.",1397433600,,259,4.26530612244898
5742168,4,B00CV1PFTC,One of our favorite actresses in an unusual role.  Enjoyed it very much. Robert Mitchum was believable as a trader looking for wealth from the natives.,1391126400,,151,4.8076923076923075
5742169,5,B00CV1PFTC,"This movie is great, and I wanted it for so long. I'm happy now. Robert and Susan played a good movie",1385337600,3,101,3.857142857142857

8586677,5,B00CV1PFTC,A movie  I saw as a child and it has lost none of its charm.  If you liked any of the 60's jungle pics you'll love this one,1517011200,,123,3.357142857142857

8586680,4,B00CV1PFTC,"Good story but this is no Mogambo or King Solomon's Mines.  I bought this for Robert Mitchum, very handsome in this movie.  Walter Slezak is a great villain.  I would say 98% of this movie is shot on the back lot of 20th Century Fox so not as fun as the others I mentioned.  Susan Hayward plays a nurse who wants to go to the back country to work with a Doctor but after getting there the Doctor is dead.  Mitchum on the other hand uses the trip to look for gold.  A young prince from the mysterious tribe is hurt by a lion then the trouble starts.",1493942400,,548,4.027777777777778
8586681,5,B00CV1PFTC,"I don't own that many fox cinema archive titles mainly because of their notoriousness of not issuing their cinerama films in the proper ratio.
But I love the jungle genre films and since this is a standard format film I took a chance...with no regret. White witch doctor was a very well
Made film that belongs along side of the other jungle adventure / romance romps as ""king Solomons mines"" and ""trader horn"". with Susan
Hayward as the titular heroine and Robert Mitchum as the jungle expert who guides her on journey to help out an under staffed missionary
Great banter not only between the romantic leads but between Mitchum and the local natives as well (I always wondered if the actors were
Actually speaking the native dialect or making it up as they went) descent paced story, sharp technicolor image and good score by Bernard
Herrmann. listen close and you hear an eerie score that would later be reused in 1959's 'journey to the center of earth'  -recommended-",1489104000,2,969,4.733727810650888
