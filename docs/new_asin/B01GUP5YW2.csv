8763611,1,B01GUP5YW2,"What happened to all the reviews of this disc? - the one with the poster framed in a blue border?  I purchased it from Amazon and I reviewed it, along with many others who were equally aghast at the wretched quality of the transfer of a particularly charming little film.  Now it would ""seem"" that NOBODY has purchased it and NOBODY has reviewed it.  Where did all these mostly (and strongly) negative reviews go??  Let me state very clearly - this is a highly inferior disc which I would not recommend to anybody.  The Technicolor is faded badly.  The audio has a loud, intermittent hiss that almost drowns out the dialog on several occasions.  My advice would be, if you live in Region B, purchase the Blu-ray release instead.  If you live, as I do, in Region A, your choices are more limited.  The transfer included in the long out-of-print Anchor Bay ""Ealing Studios Comedy"" collection is quite watchable, and if you can get hold of a copy of that and not pay collectors prices for it, that's the way to go.  In the meantime, perhaps we should all flood Anchor Bay with requests for them to reissue their set in Region A Blu-ray.",1519171200,,1133,4.509803921568627
