I COULD maybe understand releasing half seasons with a delay between each, but releasing two half seasons on the same day is plain abusive to the fans they know will buy anything. So stick you! I'm off to amazon.co.uk! ;)",1304553600,6,360,4.388059701492537

4491251,5,B004X1M3DE,"After waiting over a year for another ""Dynasty"" DVD release Paramount has finally announced that on July 5, 2011 the entire season 5 of the series will be available for purchase, albeit in two separate sets. In the first release entitled ""Dynasty: Season 5, Volume 1"" the set has four discs and contains the first 15 episodes of that season. You can also purchase the entire 29 episodes (the full season) in a special two set bundle.

 Season 5 of ""Dynasty"" was its most popular, with the series finally replacing ""Dallas"" as the #1 show in North America in the 1984/1985 television season. This year, though, saw the loss of Pamela Sue Martin as Fallon who quit the series at the end of season 4. Her character was subsequently ""killed off"" and to fill the void left by a popular character the producers decided to do damage control by hiring a bunch of Hollywood stars, among them Billy Dee Williams, Rock Hudson, and Ali McGraw. This would mark Rock Hudson's final acting job before his untimely death.

 Season five dealt with the arrival of Blake and Alexis' long-lost daughter Amanda, played beautifully by British actress Catherine Oxenberg, and her eventual love affair with her mother's husband, Dex Dexter; Krystle and Blake saw the birth if their child Krystina; and Dominique was revealed to be Blake's half-sister. Most interesting the writers finally gave Steven a gay lover by the name of Luke Fuller proving he was indeed a homosexual.

 Like other ""Dynasty"" DVD sets (with the exception of season 1) there are no bonus features, but the episodes look impeccable and are in full-frame format with English mono sound, the way they were shown on ABC.

 The following is a list of the first 15 season 5 episodes along with their airdates and storyline highlights:

1. ""Disappearance"", Sept. 26, 1984 (The Carringtons learn Fallon has had a car crash and Dominique's boyfriend arrives in Denver)

2. ""The Mortgage"", Oct. 10, 1984 (Jeff continues his search for Fallon)

3. ""Fallon"", Oct. 17, 1984 (It is revealed Fallon died in a plane crash)

4. ""The Rescue"", Oct. 24, 1984 (Steven's baby is found and Dominique tells Blake they are brother and sister)

5. ""The Trial"", Oc. 31, 1984 (Alexis goes on trial for the murder of Mark Jennings)

6. ""The Verdict"", Nov. 7, 1984 (Alexis is found guilty)

7. ""Amanda"", Nov. 14, 1984 (Alexis' and Blake's daughter arrives in town)

8. ""The Secret"", Nov. 21, 1984 (Blake confronts Alexis about her being pregnant all those years ago when he threw her out on the streets)

9. ""Domestique Intrigue"", Nov. 28, 1984 (Krystle falls down the stairs after an argument with Blake)

10. ""Krystina"", Dec. 5, 1984 (Krystle has a baby girl, but there are complications)

11. ""Swept Away"", Dec. 12, 1984 (Amanda and Dex sleep together and Alexis, not knowing what happened, marries Dex)

12. ""That Holiday Spirit"", Dec. 19 (Amanda finally learns Blake is indeed her real father)

13. ""The Avenger"", Jan. 2, 1985 (Blake's father has a heart attack)

14. ""The Will"", Jan 9, 1985 (Blake's father tells him Dominique is indeed his daughter)

15. ""The Treasure"", Jan. 16, 1985 (Alexis and Dex start to argue)",1303344000,9,3141,4.829906542056075

4491256,5,B004X1M3DE,"Another great collection of episodes of the struggle between Blake Carrington and Alexis Morrell Carrington Colby Dexter...you get the picture!  This show has all of the usual sudsy drama of daytime soaps in sharper, faster-moving narratives (since they didn't have to sustain stories 5 days a week for the whole year!).  There are lots of other reviews that will give you episode lists and plot summaries, so I'll skip that, but I'll tell you instead about all of the things I love about Dynasty:
1. The Clothes: This show is so 80s that it almost hurts your eyes!  All of the outfits worn by the cast, especially the women, are like a time capsule of high end, over the top 80s fashions!  Nolan Miller did a wonderful job creating outfits with personality and flair, and there are some memorable pieces on pretty much every episode.  He's at his best when the cast is involved in formal occasions - that's when his outrageous designs are at their best!
2. The Culture: This show is so firmly rooted in the 80s, especially with the way it handles the love life of Stephen Carrington, the sometimes-gay-sometimes-not youngest son of Blake and Alexis.  The show clearly wanted to address this issue, but no one could even say the word gay.  They mostly just referred to it very vaguely; it's hard to image that homosexuality used to be such a secretive topic and watching the actors dance around it is priceless!

The acting isn't too bad with the overblown material and this is a great small screen celebration of excess, wealth, and power.  Definitely recommended!",1404432000,,1565,4.766666666666667
4491257,4,B004X1M3DE,Great season ! I need to order the next to see what happens. My friends want to borrow the DVDs as the come in.,1401148800,,111,3.6666666666666665
4491258,3,B004X1M3DE,"As a teenager, used to love this show. I know that I'm giving away my age here, but that's fine since I've earned every passing one. I've obviously grown up since it's just okay. As a teenager, I used to look forward to each episode with great anticipation. the storylines and the lines spat by the actors were juicy and ahead of their time. Now, as I watch the show, I find I get irritated by the foolishness of it all after just one DVD and I have to stop it and watch something else. For its time though, while it lasted, Dynasty was a great show with a great ensemble cast that worked along and off of one another. The fashions were beautiful; something no other nighttime soap offered. This was the first season without Pamela Sue Martin as daughter Fallon and the first season for the appearance of long lost daughter Amanda portrayed by English actress Catherine Oxenberg. In my humble opinion, the earlier shows were the best, especially seasons two through four and excluding season one, which was bloody awful.
Overall, if you're a fan of nighttime soap operas, pure escapism and racy plotlines, there's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy this season. Just be sure not to expect Shakespeare. Who! Wait a minute! Dynasty is to its day what Shakespeare was to his day. I do detest the way that these DVDs are being released in the USA. It shows how badly the studio wants to squeeze this country for every dollar it can get where in Australia and the UK, this isn't the case.",1393027200,,1482,4.5130111524163565
4491259,5,B004X1M3DE,"Dynasty never goes out of fashion.  It's as classic as a Nolan Miller dress worn by the stunning Linda Evans.
Season 5, 1984/85, brings wonderful new characters and sees the exit of an important main character.
Rock Hudson plays an integral role in nine episodes.  He has an important connection to two of the female characters.  Catherine Oxenberg joins the cast, and is a wonderful and surprising addition as well as having the most gorgeous hair...that's just a tidbit for those of you as superficial as I am.
The stories are still based on the ever-scheming Alexis (Joan Collins) doing her level best to ruin Blake (John Forsythe)and take down his oil company Denver Carrington.  In between the scheming; there's a birth, new family members are discovered, a funeral, a trial, a fabulous Christmas, a surprising will, infidelity, kidnapping, weddings, travels to:  Turkey, Washington D.C., Santa Barbara, Sumatra, South America and more glitz and glamour by way of Nolan Miller gowns & tuxedoes than you can shake a diamond-encrusted stick at.
It's a wonderful season - one of my favorites.

The DVD quality is great for the 14 episodes here.  There are no extras on this first half of season 5.

I laugh every time I see a scene starting with a lovely display of food on an elegant table.  I know Alexis is about to appear.  She's always eating...but only the very best cuisine.  So, get something decadent to eat or drink, settle back and enjoy this wonderful season!",1392508800,,1473,4.852

8445880,5,B004X1M3DE,"I vaguely remember my parents watching this show in the 80s, as I was still a kid, but something brought  my attention to the series and I had to start watching it. So, I ended up buying ALL 9 seasons, and started watching them, one by one, during my free time. I must agree that this is one of the greatest series ever created, with Season 5 being my favorite. I absolutely love the Blake-Krystal characters, as I did the actual two actors themselves. Such a beautiful couple to watch! Linda Evans, at the time, must have been in her early forties in the series, and I loved that she and Blake had a baby, without a mention of her 'advanced maternal age' being any factor, or even Blake a father again as old as he was. The many things I loved about the show are generally things that, I believe, are lacking and even dissipating in today's society. To begin with, I loved the sophistication that was possessed and exhibited by the male characters - their pristine and professional look, their smart and intelligent conversation and dialogue, the way they handled defeat or revenge and such. Basically, manners and behaviors that do not mimic our society today. The same for the female character - intelligent dialogue, respectable behavior (even through their 'cat fights,') and a degree of wholesomeness that I really don't see today in female roles.

Another highlight of this series is how Aaron Spelling had hired some of Hollywood's greatest, like Rock Hudson. I had read that he had months to live prior to taking the role of ""Daniel Resse,"" due to his diagnosis of AIDS. He was not really interested in becoming a regular on the series due to his severe fatigue that was brought on by his illness, as he had said in an interview. He was in a handle of episodes, starting in the second half of the series. He, then, died during the filming and his death was acknowledged in the series as well. However, he brought the kind of poise and demure that only classic Hollywood had, and it was so transparent in every scene.

I just wanted to also add that, generally speaking, all the characters had their own interesting story lines and they were all intertwined beautifully. Every episode made you want to continue to see one more. The only Aaron Spelling work I remember was Beverly Hills, 90210 which I loved as a kid growing up, however, Dynasty was a mature adult soap, an amazing piece of work that can be treasured for a long time on DVDs. To bad that they don't make them like they used to.",1453161600,,2501,4.553333333333334
