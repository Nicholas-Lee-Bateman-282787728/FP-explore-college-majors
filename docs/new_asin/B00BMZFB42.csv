5656794,5,B00BMZFB42,"The toddler BEGGED me to get this movie.  He keeps turning it on and on.  It has a cute charm as the narrator is a child, and the music is catchy.  The toddler laughs hysterically at the bloopers at the end.",1401494400,,207,4.0
5656795,3,B00BMZFB42,it's ok - I just wish it was a little more geared towards toddler Pre-k age. Didn't grab my sons attention and almost anything trains pulls him right in. Not sure what about it doesn't attract him to it the way I expected?,1400025600,,222,4.186046511627907
5656796,5,B00BMZFB42,"The songs are catchy and cute. There is so much footage of all different kinds of trains and when a train crashes they say ""oh no."" It is very cute. I don't have a single complaint about this video.",1396569600,,198,4.102564102564102
5656797,5,B00BMZFB42,My son loves this video!  He's 2 and it's his favorite piece of entertainment.  It's fairly entertaining for adults too,1387929600,,119,4.9
5656798,5,B00BMZFB42,My 6 year old grandson has learned a lot about trains from this show. I watched some of it with him and it's very educational!,1386892800,,126,4.08

5656802,5,B00BMZFB42,"Perfect length of time for a 3 1/2 year old, actually kind of wish it was longer because lately we have been having to restart it 2-3 times a day! My son is obsessed with trains- and this gem has been perfect for him because it touches on not only trains, toy trains, but also on 18 wheelers, actual trucks as well. What I really like about this video is the fact they go through and label & say every name of the train, what kind of train it is, etc. I like my son to be learning something if he is watching it that much! Plus the music is cute and we have probably seen it about 50 times since we bought it!",1423440000,,609,3.9193548387096775
5656803,5,B00BMZFB42,"My 3 (soon to be 4) year old grandson is obsessed with trains.  I gave him some hand-me-down Thomas the train engine track, etc and it is all we can do to keep him from leaving his track setups out
I found this video when searching for 'anything' about trains.  He loves this one the best.
The young man that narrates speaks so clearly and slow enough so that my grandson really listens and is learning so much!
I highly recommend this and any of the 'I love toy trains' videos.",1420416000,,478,4.241758241758242
5656804,5,B00BMZFB42,"Found this little gem while searching for train videos to download to the Kindle Fire. Our 3 1/2 year old LOVES trains, and we needed something to occupy his attention on long car trips during Christmas travel.

Needless to say, purchasing this video was a terrific idea. It wasn't horribly expensive (unlike feature films), and has a myriad of features that intrigues him: Real trains, model trains, child narrator, songs, bloopers ... and an educational value.

The folks who made this video put a LOT of time and effort into it, and we greatly appreciate it.",1419638400,2,561,4.833333333333333

5656808,4,B00BMZFB42,"I rated it four only because for a three and a half it's a bit too long.  However, he is fasinated with the movie and will sit quietly (except for some laughing) for close to forty-five minutes.  I would recommend this to any parent/grandparent if your child loves trains and of course legos.",1403222400,,292,4.490566037735849

8571201,5,B00BMZFB42,"My boys (3 & 6) LOVE this video. I bought it when my 6 year old was 2. It seems to be best liked in the 2-4 year old range. My 6 year old is not as into it anymore but will still get sucked into it if it is playing. It is not as flashy as most of the kid programs these days. It is done like an educational documentary - narrated with supplemental images and videos, but very appropriate for young kids. It has some catchy songs and lots of great information. If your kid loves trains it will be a hit!",1469145600,,502,3.8365384615384617
