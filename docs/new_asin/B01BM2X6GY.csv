8750641,5,B01BM2X6GY,I got what I paid for when I used this DVD ! Being on the wrong side of 50 I searched for a DVD that could help strengthen my bones without pumping me up. The best thing about this work out is doing it at home on my schedule. Suzanne Andrews explains each exercise in a way I could understand and do. I find the back ground music relaxing and soothing. What is different about Andrews series that it geared for an intelligent audience.,1480636800,,435,4.190476190476191

Great DVD! Medically proven exercises. Her use of weights is excellent for bone strengthening. Unlike other DVD's her technique is medically proven to enhance bone health.",1478995200,,281,5.130434782608695

This DVD is intended to provide safe workouts for those who have osteoporosis.  Instructor Suzanne Andrews leads all three workouts on the DVD via voiceover instruction.  She shows the ""advanced"" version of the exercises, and she is accompanied by two background exercisers, one offering some modifications via using a chair to assist with balance (Alina or Helen) and the second providing a fully modified version of the workout while seated in a chair (Glenn).  The soundtrack for all three workouts is jazz-type Muzak.  I have provided additional details on each individual routine below.

OSTEOPOROSIS WALKING WORKOUT

For this 25-minute outdoor routine, Andrews uses optional hand and ankle weights throughout.  It is somewhat of an interval stylei.e., the ""walking"" or marching intervals alternate with slower, more strength-focused exercises such as walking lunges.  Andrews includes somewhat unique moves such as a tiptoe walk, a crab walk, and a Frankenstein walk.  The workout includes with a nice 4-minute stretch.

OSTEOPOROSIS BALANCE WORKOUT

This routine is again set outdoors.  Although designed to address balance, it includes some exercises that are more strength-based.  Andrews begins again using both hand and ankle weights.  After a marching warm-up, she does a series that includes lifting onto the toes, squats, and calf stretches.  Oddly, this same exact sequence is repeated at the end of the workout without the weights.  In-between, other moves include knee touches, leg lifts, and tightrope walking.  This routine clocks in at about 24 minutes, and then there is a 3-minute segment featuring Andrews with Dr. Helen Troncoso (one of the modifiers in the workout), who provides ""At Home Balance Test"" information.

OSTEOPOROSIS BACK STRENGTH AND STRETCH

This routine is filmed indoors.  Andrews again starts with a short walking warm-up, again wearing ankle weights.  A series of unweighted exercises follows, including moves such as shoulder rotations, neck stretch, and mild standing backbend.  Andrews then performs more traditional strength moves with the hand weights.  The exercises targeted both lower and upper body (e.g., squats, upright rows) and did not seem to focus exclusively on the back.  The 3  minute final stretch consisted solely of alternating breathing with shoulder hugs, bringing in the total workout time at just under 24 minutes, after which there is a brief additional segment that Andrews introduces as ""Bone up on calcium with Dr. Heather Melchick.""

These three workoutswhich move quite slowlycertainly would be appropriate for those with osteoporosis.  In addition, those with limited mobility issues will likely appreciate the addition of a chair-only modifier for all three routines.  Yet in her focus on osteoporosis, Andrews fails to note that holding weights in the hands while walking/placing weights around the ankles can place undue pressure on the joints, so this DVD may not be appropriate for anyone with joint issues.  Finally, I found Andrews' notes of encouragement (e.g., ""You can do it!"" and ""We put the FUN in functional fitness!"") to be a bit over-the-top, and others might as well.  Still, if you have osteoporosis, are limited in your mobility, are just starting out with exercising, and/or have other limitations that make you need of a slower, gentler approach, the workouts on this DVD may be a good fit for you.",1470096000,5,3602,5.344582593250444
8750644,1,B01BM2X6GY,"For anyone with osteoporosis please be warned. The walking segment of this dvd which includes the use of ankle weights is definitely contraindicated .  This despite the title of the dvd.  The instructor gives no warning.  She should come with a warning. The balance section of the workout equally unwise even for Ms. Andrews who seems to continuously be just short of tripping on her crumpled  blanket she miraculously steps over . Not such great instruction, or modeling, for anyone seeking to learn safe habits,and ways to avoid falling, and increase balance.",1469923200,5,561,5.065217391304348
8750645,3,B01BM2X6GY,"I really like the content.  The problem is the tape.  There are three areas that doesn't work.  I have to wait at least 5 minutes or fast forward to skip the bad portion.  I would like to return and get the new one, but I waited too long, so cannot be returned.  I bought many work out tapes, but this is the only one that the tape itself is not working properly.",1469664000,,363,3.986111111111111
