8114257,4,B000EU1MGC,"CHILDREN OF THE BRIDE (the first installment of the ""...Bride"" trilogy starring Rue McClanahan, is a gentle and funny comedy, perfect for the entire family.

Middle-aged divorced mother of four Margaret Becker (Rue McClanahan, ""The Golden Girls"") stuns everyone with her plans to marry John Hix (Patrick Duffy), a man 15 years her junior. The wedding plans get off to a rocky start when Margaret invites her four grown-up children (Jack Coleman, Anne Bobby, Kristy McNichol and Conor O'Farrell) back home...each of them harbours personal problems that threaten Margaret's new-found happiness.

Co-starring Kristy McNichol (""Empty Nest""), CHILDREN OF THE BRIDE was filmed during the height of ""Golden Girls""/""Empty Nest"" mania. It was later followed by two well-received sequels (""Baby of the Bride"" and finally ""Mother of the Bride"").",1277769600,2,834,5.5078125
