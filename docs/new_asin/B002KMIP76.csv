Leo Sayer, a brilliant guy and the DVD is an immensely highly reccommended one for both adults and children...Love it!",1325635200,,288,5.020833333333333
8372123,5,B002KMIP76,"If ever anyone was born to be a Magical Scarecrow it has to be the mopped-headed pop icon, Leo Sayer! In his reading of the final chapter in the original series of The Magical Scarecrows Leo brilliantly brings these wonderful characters to life in a manner that has them leaping off the page and into your living room.  This really is a must own for kids from 2 to 92 and anyone who loves Leo Sayer... and who doesn't?  Check out these You Tubes of Auntie Lynn's charitable contributions through The Magical Scarecrows and Leo's performance at one of her Let's Make Magic for a Day events for kids with cancer (second you tube below).
