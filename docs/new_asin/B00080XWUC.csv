2255295,5,B00080XWUC,"First off, I loved this live action movie based on Cutie Honey, a character from manga and anime, who can change into anything or anybody to help her fight crime.  As long as she has the energy to do so - so we see her eating a lot of rice balls.  Second, I am sure they changed the Cutie Honey opening lyrics, but that's OK, because they wanted to make sure it was for ages 13 and up.  Third, Eriko Sato is a great Cutie Honey.  Always happy, shapely and willing to wear that weird, if sexy, outfit.  Fourth, Carrie Keranen is the English voice actress for Cutie Honey and does a great job at matching the Japanese Idol's energy and expressions.
The story is simple.  Cutie Honey must save the world from the evil organization called the Panther Claw.  They are EVIL, because they have kidnapped girls, stolen gold and been pretty mean towards everybody.  There is a lot of fighting styled after anime and manga scenes, lots of outfits for Cutie Honey and lots of humor.  Even better is the Making of Cutie Honey feature that is one of the best extras I have seen on a DVD.  The whole movie is 93 minutes long, is fast and rarely bores you.  GET IT!",1187136000,,1150,4.3023255813953485
2255296,5,B00080XWUC,"If you're looking for a good time, this is it. Great fun, humor, action, heart, and Cutie Honey style. I felt satisfied with it and had a smile on my face through most of it. Someone on here complained about it being full screen...? I don't know, mine had the black lines at the top and bottom so I assumed it was wide screen. Regardless, I didn't feel like I was missing anything.",1180137600,9,381,4.232876712328767
2255297,4,B00080XWUC,"Cutie Honey does not get naked.  That might not seem very relevant, but if you are familiar at all with the original Go Nagai ""Cutie Honey"" series, then you know that Cutie Honey is all about getting naked, and with gravia idol Eriko Sato playing the title role, a woman who has shown time and time again that she has no problem getting naked, it is even more surprising.  During her famous ""Honey Flash"" sequence, it shifts to a CG animated figure, and even that doesn't get naked.  Now, with that out of the way, we can talk about the movie.

This is definitely not going to be a film for everyone, but it is a lot of fun.  ""Cutie Honey"" really is just a big cartoon, featuring live people. There is no attempt whatsoever to make it modern or gutsy.  Director Hideaki Anno, best know for his phenomenal anime series ""Neon Genisis Evangelion"", has decided to through all of his angst out the window and go straight for the pinkest vision of cuteness that he can possibly muster.

Eriko Sato works her way through an impossible number of cute costumes, or just runs around in her underwear, all the while being light and naively unaware of her own attributes. Her Cutie Honey suit isn't the famous original, but it is even more pink and works well.  The villains are over the top, at about the same level as a Sentai Power Rangers show.  The acting is just good enough to make sure everyone is having a good time, and the fight scenes are a blast.  Both remind me a lot of Kabuki theater, where everything is completely exaggerated beyond any believability, and that works in the context. Sure, there is some plot stitched here and there, to give the whole thing a a start and a finish, but it isn't really all that important.  Superstar Koda Kumi powers her way through the catchy Cutie Honey theme song, and I dare you not to catch yourself humming along even if you can't understand the Japanese.

If all this sounds like a blast to you, then you are going to love ""Cutie Honey"". Shut off your brain and allow the pink to wash over you.  However, if you demand even the slightest bit of sense out of a film, then you are probably going to hate it.  Its up to you.",1175644800,59,2166,4.3825

2255299,5,B00080XWUC,"As a fan of Go Nagai's Cutey Honey (spelled ""Cutie Honey"" in this film), I knew I had to see this. I was not disappointed. The film follows Honey's early life, taking its cues from the early manga and the original television series.

The movie takes a few liberties with the character, but it's got the essentials there, and Honey-chan is cute and sexy.

The details behind Honey's creation are among the most notable changes from canon, but the technology used to keep her alive is central to the film's plot and Sister Jill's quest for immortality. Honey eats a LOT in this film in order to fuel the immense power at her disposal and the scenes with her stuffing her face are very funny. I wish I could eat that much without gaining weight.

They did an excellent job on her hair and costume, and she makes good use of her sword and trademark boomerang during the fights (including one of the only times I've ever seen Honey use her boomerang UP CLOSE... and that thing does enough damage when thrown from a distance!). The movie's special effects are really pretty good, although they have a bit of a cartoony quality to them. I think this was intentional though, especially since some actual anime clips are very briefly seen during certain plot-advancing scenes; the filmmakers seem to be having fun with reminding us that this movie is based on a cartoon series. Almost all of the fights make heavy use of CGI and model effects and have a very anime-style feel to them, but they add to the fun rather than bring it down.

Honey's major nemesis in this film is Sister Jill, who is very chillingly realized through an icy performance and some damn creepy makeup. Before facing Sister Jill though, Honey has to go through her four major underlings in the Panther Claw: Gold Claw, Cobalt Claw, Scarlet Claw and Black Claw. The fight with Gold Claw is the first major battle in the movie, and though Gold Claw essentially loses, she's retained until shortly before the climax then suddenly disposed of, one of the few things in the film that really doesn't seem to work. The battle with Cobalt Claw is very intense and gives us a good look at the conflict Honey deals with throughout the film: her desire to do good versus her desire to take revenge for her father's murder. Honey's emotions get the better of her in the fight with Cobalt Claw and she's left with a lot to think about afterwards.

She doesn't face the other two until she's ready for her showdown in the Panther Claw complex, and Scarlet Claw is a joke. Black Claw, however, is the first villain to truly give Honey a run for her money; their battle is spectacular. I thought of David Bowie as the Goblin King (from the 1986 movie ""Labyrinth"") when Black Claw appeared, microphone in hand, singing to Honey before engaging her in battle. Black Claw's ensemble of musicians continues to play music as Black Claw and Honey duel. It just doesn't get better than that!

The friends Honey makes along the way join her in the Panther Claw complex and put their lives on the line willingly, though really more for their own reasons than Honey's. I liked the relationships Honey established with them, especially with the hard-nosed Natsuko; it added some nice weight to the story. The story is just as much an exploration of what it means to live life as it is a display of Honey kicking butt.

You don't really see much by the way of nudity, just so you know. Whenever Honey performs a Honey Flash her body is obscured by light, but there are a couple scenes in which she's dressed skimpily enough that we are not completely deprived of our cheesecake.

A word about the DVD: the subtitles are a little mistimed, so they sometimes don't tell you what's being said until the character is already done speaking. You get used to it though (especially if you're a fast reader) and it's not as bad as it could have been. There's no dub, either, so if you don't like subtitles you'll just have to deal.

It's really a pretty good live-action take on Honey and I definitely recommend it if you're a Honey fan.",1168387200,4,4064,4.556164383561644
2255300,4,B00080XWUC,"This film is quite fantastic if you are a fan of ridiculous Asian cinema or any of the Power Rangers series. No matter how bad or good you think the film is, you will be sucked in by the uber-attractive Erika Sato, unless of course you are not attracted to women. She is beyond cute. But you want to know about the film...OK.

 There isn't much of a story. Cutie Honey has to beat the bda guys and save the day because the police force is very inept. There are 5 ridiculous baddies she must fight off on her way to saving the world (some tougher than others). The effects are surprisingly good (mostly). You have to know what you are getting into when you pop it in just by looking at the cover, so if you don't find ridiculously stupid Asian films with ridiculously attractive Asian girls fun to watch, you are in the wrong place.

2255303,4,B00080XWUC,"This is the most B-Movie of Japanese B-Movies. There's some evidence of a budget and the occasional bit of acting. DOn't worry the acting doesn't get in the way of the plot in any meaningful way. The plot? Well it seems that Cutie Honey has to prevent an evil power from kidnapping and draining young women to maintain their power. It's quite silly and fast paced. The characters are suitably over the top and Cutie's struggles to balance a day job with super-heroism are amusing and provide an interesting commentary on the hierarchical nature of Japanese business life and how it wastes the talents of half of the publication.
This isn't a serious film. It has bright colours, some explosions and some action sequences. Cutie honey is a lot of fun.",1466899200,,750,4.732824427480916

It was extremely fun to watch - even though I am not really much of an Anime buff - my wife wanted it. But after watching it, I was thoroughly entertained! (even though there is a scene sequence about mid way through that sorta lulls - when Cutie Honey is moping around the city - it just dragged on and was clearly just a collage of Cutie looking, well, cute for no functional reason...but hey, that's Anime, right?)

2255311,4,B00080XWUC,"Okay, so I bought the limited edition which comes with a Lunch Box, a Key Chain and a DVD. The DVD that came with it does have Special Features which includes a 23 minute feature called ""The Making of Cutie Honey,"" which includes some behind the scenes and some Q&A's during press conferences, and two trailers for the film plus DVD Credits. Another thing to note, the back of the DVD case only lists English as the only language option, but the DVD itself was bilingual and has the Japanese Audio as well as the English and it has English Subtitles. Personally, I think the Sub was better, but the Dub wasn't to bad. All in all, I got this for $5.00 and for what I got, I don't think this was a bad investment.",1429920000,6,711,4.274074074074074
2255312,4,B00080XWUC,An interesting live-action adaptation of the Anime.  Kinda freaky to watch the visual effects that attempt to replicate the animated effects.,1425772800,,141,5.714285714285714
2255313,5,B00080XWUC,"I bought this movie on DVD from Hong Kong when it first came out and loved it. This is such a fun movie. And then I loaned the DVD to a friend and never got it back. Ten years later I go looking for the DVD and find this listing.

The packaging seems to indicate that the only audio option is English, so while I am watching and enjoying the movie I am looking to see what other versions of the DVD are available, and I happen to push the audio button to see if I can tell the difference between the 2.0 and the 5.1 on my TV, and there I find Japanese audio in the 2.0 and 5.1 options. :) This is easily one of the better English dubs I have heard outside of Miyazaki films, but the original Japanese is always preferable.

Yes the DVD does come with a Lunchbox and this special edition is only $7. No I don't know why.

If you like Godzilla, Masked Rider, Super Sentai, Ultraman and other fun Tokusatsu like that you should enjoy this. This one is more fun and less heavy than the live action movies of Casshern and Devilman.

The downside is that if this has been reduced in price down to $7 witha lunchbox, there is little chance Cutie Honey: The Live (the series) will ever see US DVD release. There is a really expensive (and probably out of print) R2 boxset from Japan that is guaranteed not to include English subtitles.",1425254400,,1327,4.192156862745098

2255315,4,B00080XWUC,"Some kinds of gifts are good when you have a birthday, while other gifts for good for when you celebrate something. But when it comes to giving a gift based on their favorite hobby, that's what hard to figure out the most.

Cutie Honey (Limited Edition) set is a great idea for fans of either the anime or manga series. The movie is actually not bad, and is toned down from it's anime counter-part. (Not as much nudity, just suggestiveness) The movie itself is actually pretty good compared to other anime to live-action movies that's out there. The quality of the movie is very good as this was more than just a fan made movie. As for the story, I will not give the plot away, you are just going to have to see the movie yourself.

The set comes to you as a tin lunch-box. Inside you get the DVD movie and a ""Cutie Honey"" key chain. The extras are protected by a sponge material that is coated inside the tin lunch-box. All together an interesting gift idea for the ""Cutie Honey"" fan.

Normally you would expect some kind of ""adult"" material to appear in this movie, as that was the case with the anime, but that is NOT the case. The movie itself is very clean, even a child can watch it. Language is moderate (No swearing of any kind) and the violence was not that bad. Action sequences are equal only to the ""Power Rangers"" battle scenes. A very comical movie for the whole family to watch. My only recommendation is that you see the anime series, as the movie doesn't totally explain a lot of her past. Ideally, for fans of the series, but also for anyone who likes a ""cute"" action movie.",1400630400,2,1592,4.353535353535354

2255320,4,B00080XWUC,"I bought the Asian import of the movie, so many of the extras on this version are probably not on my copy.  One difference is that the subtitles are not well-written on the import.

To the movie...

I am not into anime.  Yes, I watched early stuff from Japan, like ""Speed Racer"" and ""Space Battleship Yamato,"" but not 90s and 2000s animation.  I do like some of the features, like ""Steamboy"" and ""Akira,"" but that is as far as it goes for me.  I bought ""Cutie Honey"" because I've been into sword-wielding Asian women for a few years now.  I like to see these women kick some bad-guy-butt!  I'm not a die-hard anime fan.

""Cutie Honey"" was another movie I really was not expecting to be great.  I decided (perhaps prematurely at the time) to let my daughter watch, along with my wife and myself.  We were laughing quite a bit at the over-the-top acting by the ""baddies"" and the computer animation.  There is some really great computer effects in the movie!  The dialogue is quite witty, too.  I have to say that for myself, and not knowing anything about the animated series (until after the movie), I was not too lost with the storyline.  I guess it would help to know a little more about the characters, though, through watching the animated stuff.

I, particularly, liked the ""Odd Couple"" chemistry between Cutie and Natsuko.  Truly great stuff, and attractive actresses to boot.  The humor from and between the ""Claws"" and Sister Jill was also very good.  I thought the use of color in many of the scenes were top-notch.  A problem I found is that Cutie was obviously NOT played by Eriko Sato in many of the ""rear shots.""  The front shots obviously look to have been done with green screen effects.  However, who would have a well-known model running around Japan while filming?  The movie would never be finished.

It was just a very well done work of taking an animated character and putting it into live action.

4.25 of 5 for entertainment value.  It wouldn't hurt to read about the characters beforehand.  I was a bit lost over the ""no clothes"" concept until I learned who Cutie was, for example.  Quite a bit of comic book violence, and can creep little children out, especially a couple of the ""Claw"" characters.",1355097600,,2222,4.585241730279898
2255321,4,B00080XWUC,"I was a fan of the New Cutey Honey OVA that came out in the 90's. This live action adaptation is one of the best 'comic book movie' adaptations ever made.

2255322,5,B00080XWUC,"Greetings;

Seeing Eriko Sato running down a busy street in her underwear with a garbage bag as a dress while everyone turns to face the camera, falling over or running into one another, tripping over themselves to catch an eyefull. Thats just awesome, though why on earth she doesn't have any regular clothes is just beyond me, she has to get full of food for access energy to generate her own wardrobe, I am not asking for realizm, but why have a bra and panties at all then if she lacks clothes at all? Other reviewers have referred to it as going pink, being cute, sexy, but never quite nekkid, I get it, mind you, but still.

Something about the copy I got of it though...No commercials is just fine with me, but the prodiction value of the disk itself is a bit shakey, there are times when the movie starts to fragment out and/or freeze up on me. If I had some better units to play it on, I am sure it would be far less of a problem, but I am saying that the problem does exist.

The only other thing I noticed about my copy is that the cover art is different from what is depicted, I ordered the non-special edition, which shows Cutie Honey standing, full body frame with a heart in the background, however the copy I received is the cover art shown in the special edition-sorry, limited edition. I am guessing then that the only real difference is that the limited edition has a varient box art, key chain and some manner of metal tin case, lunch box looking number.

So, really, if I had my way to do it all over again, I would probably shell out the extra-within reason, to get the limited edition just for the extras, still a good movie though ^_^

8055043,5,B00080XWUC,"This film is an early 2000s adaptation of a 1970s manga  anime series. While I can't speak of how faithful it is, not having watched the anime (yet), I can say it's really really weird and very very good. It's a surreal, cartoony, hilarious film with a lot of heart. There are cliches to be found here, and a saturday morning cartoon villain to be fought with the power of emotions. It almost feels like somebody took a typical saturday morning cartoon that was going through puberty and bashed it on the head a couple of times. There's fanservice out the wazoo, and fight scenes you need to see to believe. Every character in the film is memorable and loveable, even the villains.

The cinematography does what it needs to do and the film is nice enough to look at, but never particularly beautiful. The director is mostly known for his anime work and you can tell he brought a lot of that with him here. Thats not bad either. The film mixes live action and animation, with a pretty damn cool opening animation and some animated flashback scenes. There's also some really bad CGI that I adore.

The writing, while simple and filled with cliches in it's good vs. evil plot, manages to give  characters enough depth and personality for you to really care about them. While the film is primarily a comedy that spoofs the superhero genre, it's also a genuinely good, but very cheesy superhero film. There is drama and conflict and even some emotional scenes and they work. They shouldn't work, because the film is zany and hyperactive, but they do. Anno has managed to make a film that would normally suffer from all it's conflicting elements into a film that excels because of them.

The acting, is hard to judge.  It's kind of all over the place. There's a lot of scenery chewing going on here, some pretty big hams. But again it works and feels natural within the very odd universe this film has created.

All in all, I wouldn't call this Anno's best work, certainly not his most intelligent or meaningful, but it's a fun, exciting ride that's nice to revisit once in a while. Maybe It's just because it hits all my soft spots and I like weird schlocky Japanese movies and love the director, but it's one of my favorite live action films, when it comes to superheroes anyways. Would reccomend.",1513987200,,2293,4.578048780487805

Worked fine on my blu ray player.",1491091200,,207,3.9047619047619047
8055048,1,B00080XWUC,This DVD didn't work the first time I plugged it in.  Played maybe five minutes and then lost itself in pixilation.  I tried to clean it - no help.  I would have sent it back but I didn't get around to watching it until I'd had it for over a month so I had to eat it.,1486166400,,267,3.6491228070175437
8055049,2,B00080XWUC,"I don't know a lot about anime, so perhaps this review seems irrelevant. As a movie movie, however, this is fairly insipid.  Maybe kids or grown-up kids would like it. Sorry. Eriko Sato is lovely and has shapely legs, but it takes more than that and flashy cartoonish special effects to make a film.",1478736000,,299,4.537037037037037

They need to remove the ""Collectors Edition"" headline and show what you really get.",1471824000,,257,4.863636363636363
