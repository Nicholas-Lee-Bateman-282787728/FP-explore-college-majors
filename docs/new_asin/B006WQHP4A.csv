5026111,1,B006WQHP4A,"Even professionally made junk is still junk and while ""7 Below"" has two exceptional actors in the form of Ving Rhames and Val Kilmer (although Kilmer hasn't done anything worthwhile since ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang""-although both are on cruise control in their roles)in it, ""7 Below"" fails to surprise or scare.

A group of travelers (Kilmer among them) are stranded in a creepy house with a creepy host(Rhames)when a tornado watch forces them off the road. Then the killing starts. Well, I suppose you could say the killing starts. We don't SEE one of the earliest killings and its ALL played off screen (perhaps they ran into issues with how the scene was shot). In films like this it's all about how creative the murder sequences are since that's kind of the purpose of movie.

""7 Below"" just meanders from scene-to-scene without much action and what little character development there is in the film is mostly cliched.

SPOILERS:

Kilmer's character of Bill dies early on perhaps he had the biggest paycheck or a more important gig waiting. Rhames remains the one delight in the film particularly with a clever intentional reference to ""Top Gun"" involving a scene with Kilmer. Although Rhames KNOWS he's in an awful movie he manages to have fun with his role as Jack.

The transfer looks pretty decent and audio although not outstanding had a decent mix as well.

Special features are limited to a trailer.

I'd avoid this one as there are dozens of better horror flicks out there. Kilmer is slumming and although Vhames has fun with his role, it's not enough to save this flick. Even for a buck this seemed too expensive. ""7 Below"" reminds us that most flicks that end up going straight to video do so for a very good reason--they just aren't very good.

After learning that a terrible event occurred 100 years ago in that house they wonder if that is the reason. I am old enough to remember when Val Kilmer was a real actor. Movies like ""The Doors"", ""Batman Forever"", ""Top Gun"" and my favorite ""Tombstone"" seem like a long distant memory. This movie is not the one that will break him out of his drought. While it did start off OK it quickly turned in to a forgettable movie. I'm not sure if Ving Rhames just didn't care or if he was trying to be over the top in this knowing that it was lame. Either way it was a little annoying. I know there are still some Kilmer fans out there that will like this but for me watching him lately just makes me feel sorry for him.

5026115,3,B006WQHP4A,"The movie starts out like a slasher film with a series of murders in 1910. 100 years later, a van filled with tourists headed to a resort gets stranded in that same house due to an accident. A large storm is brewing. The music during the credits would indicate the film is a thriller-mystery and not the slasher film it started out to be. Val Kilmer plays a corporate lawyer from Chicago. He cheats on his wife (Bonnie Somerville) with everyone possible. His wife knows about the constant affairs and would like to have some sex from time to time too. There is a pair of brothers (Luke Goss and Matt Barr), one of which is into past life regressions. Ving Rhames is their host. There is also a doctor in the group (Christian Baha). Rebecca Da Costa is a convenience store clerk.

There is immediate tension between Kilmer and Rhames as it becomes a battle to see who can act the most ostentatious, contrary, and bizarre. As the 100 year storm rages on, the events of the past unfold in the present.

The problem with this film is that it tries so hard to be clever, it isn't. Ving Rhames with his fedora, time piece, and cigar love making creates a lousy character as we see him as ""Tony Todd light."" Kilmer, likewise had a bad role, one where acting was optional. Overall the characters were fairly drab which made for a dull feature.

5026118,3,B006WQHP4A,"This film starts out with a family who in 1911, are all murdered one stormy night (well it's always stormy isn't it?) by their adopted son. We then skip forward 100 years to find a group of people all going on some sort of retreat for various reasons. There is womanising Bill McCormick (a be-ponytailed Val Kilmer) who is trying to rekindle his waning marriage, a doctor and two brothers who are grieving the loss of their mother. Then a mysterious woman appears in the road and the driver attempts to miss her and in so doing they have a crash.

Not to worry as the 7th Cavalry turn up in the shape of Jack (Ving Rhames), he tells them the storm is going to be lethal and they had better come to his house to shelter from it. Bill has also sustained a head injury and they can treat him there. Jack then tells them that their mobile/cell phones will not work in this area, so another box is ticked in the `no way to get help' stakes. Soon they start to see things that have no other explanation than they are ghosts. So this is not a slasher movie if that is what you were looking for. As the storm closes in, the options start running out and the inevitable past starts to catch up with the future.

This is actually not a bad film, the acting is all solid enough, Luke Goss as Isaac is showing more and more promise as a reliable actor. Matt Barr as his brother Adam is also one to watch and Ving Rhames is nicely ambiguous which is just how it needs to be played. I did not get any plot holes and the twists occur more than in just the nasty knife work, so that is also appreciated. The thing is it is not very gripping, and that is where its falls down. It does have its moments and the lighting is done superbly to create the most out of the atmosphere, but my mind wandered on more than one occasion. On IMDB it gets a 3.2 out of 10, which is not very good, but as I said this does have its moments and in many respects this is a solid film, but if you are trading on scares and thrills then that is where the effort should have gone, hence my rating, actually a 3.5 would have been fairer but this is really just above being OK. Also a word for Val Kilmer fans he does not get much screen time, but is good value when he does. All in all a film for fright fans who absolutely adore the genre.",1363996800,,2301,4.088495575221239
5026119,2,B006WQHP4A,"Seven Below(released April/12)stars Val Kilmer as McCormick,Ving Rhames as Jack,Luke Goss as Issac,Bonnie Somerville as Brooklyn,Matt Barr as Adam and others. This is a huge disappointment,considering the talent that was on deck here. The fickle finger of fate can easily be pointed at one thing:the writing. It is as lame and cliched as they come,and there is no stopping this juggernaut's personal voyage to the bottom of the sea.
The story intro's us to a dysfunctional household in in the early 20th century. It's inhabitants make up a family of six,three children,a mother,a wife,and a husband who openly sleeps with other women and abuses his wife. It seems their only boy is adopted and one night during a terrible storm(are there ever any other type of nights in these stories?),he goes on a killing spree and kills his entire family. We never do learn about what happened to the boy post murders. Fast forward in time and there is a van carrying some people to a retreat. Along the way one of them spots a girl,who promptly disappears. Farther on the girl is seen in the road which sends the van careening into a tree. The driver lies dead and the rest are wondering what the next move is. In comes Rhames who lives just up the road a piece and offers them all sanctuary from a coming storm,which it will later turn out is a ""storm of the century"".
Rhames is hospitable up to a point but Kilmer has a gash on his head and is seemingly delirious,as he keeps repeating that they all ought to get out of the house. The storm approaches ever nearer and Barr feels he should at least try to go for help. On the way he finds a truck broken down and the girl driving it is the same clerk he met at a convenience store earlier that day. He offers her a drive back to her place of employ to get gas but the road,they soon find,is blocked. So it is back to Rhames digs for the night. Seems they should have listened to Kilmer's advice because poor old Val is the first one to go as he lay delirious in bed. One by one death stalks the entire house. Rhames is questioned by Goss out in the barn and later Barr questions him when he finds incriminating old photos and newspaper clippings of the old murdered family in the basement. One photo which has Barr stumped is a picture showing Rhames standing beside the murdered family when they were alive. Well things keep going downhill until there are only Rhames and four others left. The four make a break for it through the woods and one of the two women get stabbed. The two guys get separated but eventually find each other again along with the convenience store clerk. They end up back at the house they left from but the murder victims along with the original family are all seated at a table eating. Rhames stands next to the table. It seems he was originally their servant and that the victims so far,and the ones still alive,are all the reincarnations of that original family. The three flee only to run into the stabbed woman. Farther out they end up amongst some newly dug graves and head stones with their names on them. The three end up blaming Rhames,who says has been around for centuries and goes by ""many names"".But he isn't the killer,the killer is the possessed convenience store clerk. She stabs one of the guys then she stabs herself,to end the curse. The movie ends with a fast forward and Barr has married the convenience store clerk,who is miraculously not dead after all. She is cutting up some veggies for supper and it shows Barr leave for the dining room while she picks up the knife and heads out to him. Out in the woods is the little boy who originally murdered his parents. Oooooh.
The ending should have been the clerk dying. But just to show how much worse things could get,they added their own padded ending onto it. Kilmer gets top billing here,but really has just a pedestrian part(and plays it so) and is either sitting or laying down for most of it,which is very short lived as he is the first victim,not too far into the film. With this been-there done-that cliche' ridden plot,none of the actors really get a chance to shine. By the time we learn the truth about Rhames,he's standing there with a moving pocket watch trying to act scary,but it just comes across as cheesy. All the others do the best with what they have,but all the fog/mist,incidental music,running shadows,disappearing/reappearing people,reflections in the mirror of those not really there,etc,etc.,could not possibly save this turkey of a film.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include the trailer.
Boy what a let down this was. A good cast just thrown to the dogs with a terrible cliched script. There is nothing scary to be seen here folks. Give it a pass. 1 1/2-2 stars.",1361318400,,4784,4.557491289198606

5026121,1,B006WQHP4A,"God and baby Jesus help me, this was an abysmal movie.  Around the 11 minute- mark, I knew I was in big trouble if I continued to watch.  But there was a glimmer of hope that it might be one of those ""So Bad It's Good"" type of movies.  But no.  It wasn't.  It was just bad.  And it got worse.  I know this because I kept watching, which is a decision I now have to live with.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  This is so bad, so very bad, that I truly believe I will regret the time I spent watching it until the day I die.

7 Below is a pathetic failure on all fronts.  The script, the acting, the production, the directing, the sound, the lighting, and on and on.  I don't even know what a gaffer does, but I would bet my life that the gaffer screwed up royally too.

There's not one thing right with this.  Val Kilmer, who is a good actor, can't even steal a scene from the cadavers he's sharing the screen with.  But how could he with a script like this? He has nothing to say. None of them do.  Their dialogue is written as merely a thing that moves the plot along.  Not for one moment are you able to suspend your disbelief and believe that these are real people reacting to real things in real time.

If the acting was good, you might tolerate the unorignal and hackneyed script.  If the script was good, you might forgive the lazy, wooden performances.  If the director was any good, he might have been able to make this mess somewhat interesting.  But no.  No one comes and saves the day here.  It's doomed.  It's like a row of dominoes where each one is placed three yards apart.  It never has a chance.

This thing is treading water right out of the gate.  The viewer can either walk away, or watch it slowly and painfully drown to death.

I wish I had just walked away.",1350864000,4,1784,4.107558139534884
5026122,2,B006WQHP4A,"It's a sad time when the best actors in your movie are on the list of worst things about it.  Then again, with the number of things wrong with this movie, the odds weren't in their favor anyway.

We'll start with the completely unoriginal premise.  100 years ago, a young boy (adopted) murdered his entire family.  Now, 100 years later, a group of people who are the reincarnated spirits of those dead family members is led back to the house where it all happened so it can happen again.

Why?  Because it's their destiny.

Ok, I can handle the little adopted boy is crazy and killed his family.  Clich, but we'll go with it anyway and see what happens.  Then we cut to present day and meet our 5 main characters who are all in a van on their way to some kind of resort?  In the middle of Ohio?  What kind of resort puts you in a van and drives you through Ohio?  And not even well-populated ""happening scene"" Ohio, we're talking out in the sticks.  As they're driving along, a mysterious woman appears in the road, leading the van into a tree where the driver is killed.

In the next shot, Jack (Ving Rhames) has appeared, a local who tells them the hospital is two hours away (everyone is fine except Bill McCormick--Val Kilmer--who has a cut on his forehead), but his house is just up the road.  We'll leave the driver here--lying on the side of the road next to the wrecked van--and I'll call someone from my house.  Best get moving, storm's coming.

So they pile into Jack's pickup and go to his house where he tells them he doesn't have a phone.  They seem none too surprised by this and start drinking Jack's whiskey.  Eventually med student Adam (Matt Barr) asks Jack if he can use his truck to go back to the gas station they had stopped at before hitting the tree.  Maybe he can call someone from there.

Wouldn't advise it, Jack says, the roads were closed earlier.

Can you get me some snacks, asks Brooklyn (Bonnie Sommerville), Bill's wife.

Jack was right, the roads are closed, but Adam runs into Courtney (Rebecca Da Costa), the gas station attendant who was on her way home when her car ran out of gas.  So she's looking under the hood.  Adam drives her back to Jack's house instead where Jack offers her an old white dress to put on in place of her clothes which, as far as I could see, didn't look dirty or wet at all.

As the night wears on, Bill comes up dead, so he's taken out to the barn.  Brooklyn screams, but afterward doesn't seem too upset.  Adam and his brother Isaac (Luke Goss) decide to leave, and head out to Jack's truck only to find the wires have been cut.  So they go back inside where Courtney and Adam go to bed, but later Adam gets up and wanders the house.  Then another of their party, Dr. Lipski, turns up dead and the four decide to leave again.  We'll go to the barn, either Adam or Isaac says--I don't remember which--for supplies, then head out.

To the barn for supplies?  I have to call a halt here for a second.  First of all when the brothers decided to leave earlier, they went out to Jack's truck.  Now, when they've decided to leave, they go out to the barn ""for supplies"".  What I find most strange is that not once during either of these moments did Jack speak up and say, ""Um, guys, this is my stuff.  You don't live here.""  And second, supplies in the BARN?  Are they taking a bale of hay with them?  Someone needs a bag of feed for the journey?  All they get from the barn is a lantern and a flashlight.  I don't have a barn, but I'm pretty sure if I did, that's not where I would keep my flashlights.

At this point we reach the requisite ""everyone gets separated so the killer can strike again"" scene, which leads to the confusing and so badly written climax before the movie ends, none of which I'll go into here.

Do I really HAVE to?  Haven't I said enough already?

7 BELOW is written by Kevin Carraway (who also directed) and Lawrence Sara, who have worked on a few other projects together as well--and if the end result of this movie is any indication, maybe they should stop.

The script is just head-shakingly bad, stiff and leading and not the least bit subtle, while the direction is strictly by the numbers stuff with absolutely no heart behind it.  Val Kilmer and Ving Rhames, the two actors I expected would at least give this movie some kind of umph totally phoned in both of their performances (I'm not entirely convinced Rhames wasn't downing bottles of Sudafed between shots as lackluster as he appeared), while everyone else spent the movie looking either confused or surprised.  Matt Barr seems to be taking things way too seriously while Luke Goss spends most of the movie with his feet up, listening to music.  I can't even be sure he knew they were rolling half the time.  Rebecca Da Costa as Courtney was just hard to watch at times as she struggled to get her lines across despite an accent so thick it could have stood in for the tree that demolished that van.

I don't know which was worse, the look on her face when she was supposed to be doing something serious, or hearing her constantly dropping the M to half the words she pronounced (the word is SOMEthing, not sunt-thing).

There was another scene where everyone is looking for Jack (the house isn't THAT big, so why it takes 4 people to split into groups of 2 and look for a big black man I don't know.  I mean, it's a country house, not a mansion) and they come across the body of Dr. Lipski.  Brooklyn runs to the bathroom to throw up while Isaac waits outside.  A second later he tells her ""You should get some rest while I look for Jack.  I'll be back in a second.""

So she should rest for a second?  And you just found a body with its throat cut.  You pick NOW to split up?

And the editing here is no better than the script.  It can be difficult enough keeping track of so many characters in a movie like this, but with so many cuts back and forth and very few establishing shots to figure out where we are in relation to everyone and everything else, it's nearly impossible.

Reading the synopsis on the back of the DVD case, I was looking forward to this movie.  And it's been a while since I've seen either Val Kilmer or Ving Rhames in anything of significance anyway, so I was eager for that, too.  Little did I know Kilmer would be killed off in the first half hour and Rhames would give the second worst performance in the movie.

I don't know what was going on with this movie, but it was a confusing jumble of mess from beginning to end.  Don't waste your time or your money on this one.",1347148800,3,6548,4.317473338802297
5026123,2,B006WQHP4A,"One of those films with no real surprises and a very incomplete feel to it. It seems the makers wanted to create a brand-new, really frightening haunted house film, had some interesting twists and concepts to work with, but didn't quite know where to go with them, so they just did the same old thing that's been done a gazillion times before. The bells, chimes, and rain pattering on the roof might have served to create tension and atmosphere 50 years ago, but not today. Vivid cinematography, believable dialogue, and pretty good acting (most notably Rebecca Da Costa as Courtney), but we don't know the too-plentiful characters well enough to attain much empathy with them.

Ving Rhames is Jack who lives nearby and gives the group a ride back to his home to avoid an oncoming storm.

Kilmers character Bill was injured in the crash and hes put in a bedroom to rest.  Fortunately for him one of the travelers is a doctor and another is a med student.  Jack keeps insisting the group must remain at the house due to the terrible storm although Director Kevin Carraway does a terrible job of convincing viewers that this is anything worse than the average thunderstorm.  Despite tornado warnings the group is constantly going outside where there barely seems to be a breeze.  Adam, the Med Student does try to leave but finds a tree blocking the ONLY road.  He does however find Courtney, a convenience store employee and brings her back to Jacks farmhouse.

Soon all of the guests are seeing and hearing thingschildren laughing, and the specter of a young boy murdering his sisters with a knife.  They are trapped within the house, repeating a cycle of violence that began 100 years ago, Jack creeps around the house spouting ominous lines like Bela Lugosi out of an old horror movie.  I love Kilmer, Goss, and Rhames.  Theyre a lot of fun to watch but boy did they step into one horribly scripted and senseless production here.

Carraway pulls out every last horror film clich&eacute; he can think ofthe block road preventing escape, a car that mysteriously becomes disabled, phantoms appearing in a mirror or in bed with one of the characters, etcI have no clue as to what Ving Rhames character was supposed to be and then Carraway mucks things up with a terrible ending.  Outside of some fine, although massive scene-chewing performances, theres little reason to watch this snooze-fest.",1438387200,,2130,4.672922252010724
