2839332,1,B000QQEY28,"I liked this show when it was on HBO, but the Mill Creek Entertainment DVD release is literally up the creek. The audio is horrible and the whole thing plays like a silent film. The audio is so low I turned my sound up to the maximum, and it was still like listening to whispering at Church on Sunday.",1256169600,19,301,4.11864406779661
2839333,2,B000QQEY28,"When played on my DVD player & TV, the sound quality of these discs is terrible.  I had to crank the volume up to hear the dialog, which then got lost in a hiss.  Meanwhile, the music level is fine -- which means when the volume is up, you get lots of hiss punctuated by huge blasts of saxophone.  (I've only had sound issues with 1-2 other DVDs on my player, out of 100s, but the player is about 4 years old and the TV is about 10).

The sound quality seems okay, when played on a Mac computer, or on a newer DVD player & digital TV.",1240444800,3,534,3.9166666666666665
2839334,3,B000QQEY28,"This is a rerelease of the Philip Marlowe collection labled as season 1 when it's really season ""2"". If you don't have the collection already, the sound and picture is as good and it takes up less shelf space but it's not the season 1. If you have the ""Philip Marlowe collection"" you'll just be doubling up.",1188345600,23,307,4.4035087719298245

8196879,5,B000QQEY28,"I watched this series on HBO in the 80's when it first came out. I have always thought that Power Boothe, the wonderful character actor would be a great male lead. In this series, he is front and center as Phillip Marlowe, unfiltered Lucky in his mouth and Fedora on his head.
The series has him reciting the great Raymond Chandler dialogue that we recognize from Humphrey Bogart in the 1930's. The treatment of the series is not too tongue and cheek and does not disappoint. At approximately 1 hour per episode, it allows the story develop but  not drag.

If you like ""gumshoe"" action with the old cool cars and clipped dialogue, you will enjoy this.",1414281600,3,651,4.555555555555555
8196880,1,B000QQEY28,"I thought this would've been much better.  Next to Humphrey Bogart, Powers Boothe is the best Marlowe and that's why it was disappointing to watch this.  Bad acting and awful scripts make this a passer by.",1388448000,,205,4.666666666666667
8196881,4,B000QQEY28,"Sure I have been on a Phillip Marlowe run of late, mainly re-reading Raymond Chandler's major crime novels from 1930s and 1940s which feature the tough guy, seen-it-all private detective. Those novels ranging from The Big Sleep to Payback (seven in all) pretty much tell the story of Marlowe's many bouts with the bad guys (and gals) of the world down in sunny Los Angeles before it exploded after World War II into a big time town. A time long ago when a man (or woman) could know that city, that slumming city and its' high and low life without a map. Those novels also developed Marlowe's trademark approaches to things, his forever tilting after windmills for one thing or another, usually a dame in trouble but not always, always playing by his own rules, and not afraid to take a bump or two, or a slug or two, for a client.

Some of those traits, and Chandler's early character development of Marlowe, were first written in some short stories in the 1930s collected in one volume called Trouble Is My Business (the original twelve story volume not the more recent four story volume or the Library of America volume). Those twelve short stories were presented in a British television series in 1983 under the title Phillip Marlowe Private Eye, the DVD under review, starring Powers Boothe as out intrepid P.I. And while, for my money, it is always better with Chandler, and fellow crime novel pioneer Dashiell Hammett, to read their works to get a real flavor of how he presented Marlowe over time this series is worth watching.

Of course there have been many Marlowes starting with the king hell king Marlowe, Humphrey Bogart, in The Big Sleep and working through such Hollywood stars as Dick Powell, Robert Montgomery, Robert Mitchum, James Garner, and Elliot Gould. Powers Boothe fits somewhere in the middle of that tribe, maybe being just a little too handsome and a little too nonchalant to be a top shelf Marlowe. Still, like every Marlowe, he intrepidly works his way through the twelve story set tangling with bad guys, bad women, good women, competent and incompetent cops, guys on the take, lamos, loses , drifters, grifters, and midnight sifters. The normal bill of fare for any Marlowe worth his salt. Remember though read the twelve stories first and then watch this series which, except for additional tough guy and world-weary dialogue, is faithful to the plot line of those stories.",1377475200,2,2406,4.795180722891566
8196882,3,B000QQEY28,"I love Raymond chandler's writings.  This HBO series is below par, however.  Powers Boothe tries too hard to be cool byu underacting.  The acting in general is stagey and the pacing is slow.  It is acceptable entertainment, but could hve been much better.",1377216000,,255,4.8604651162790695
8196883,2,B000QQEY28,"This was just bad television and no wonder it came on late at night.  The idea of a hard drinking hard hitting ladies man with a cool debonair style was what I remembered.  The currant reality is for series is bad acting, bad directing and even worse story lines.",1373414400,,263,4.346938775510204

8196885,3,B000QQEY28,"Although a big fan of Raymond Chandler, I had never seen this production.  It's only OK.  The filming of this in either Toronto or the UK does not add to it as you lose all sense of Los Angeles at that time.  The portrayal of Marlowe does not convey his wit and humor.  It should have been much better.  I would like to see the 1960 version of Marlowe done as a tv series but I do not know if it is easily available.",1307145600,,416,3.9047619047619047
