8317807,2,B001LDROZO,"THE SPECTACULAR CHER

As a fifty-six-year old, I grew up when Sono and Cher began their career. I was always fascinated by Cher's voice abd costumes because I knew that she had a sheer body-suit under her clothing; therefore, I was not shocked.  When she walked out on the stage in the black suit with the hose held up by a guitar belt, I was very displeased when I realized that she was necked on the rear. For me this ruined the entire DVD. This definately lowered my ratings of her as a fantastic singer.  She has been a role model for many people who grew up with Cher from the beginning of her career.  This certainly lowered my respect for her.",1239753600,3,650,4.30327868852459
