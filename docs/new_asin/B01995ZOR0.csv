7565639,5,B01995ZOR0,I like jennifer aniston movies.,1462579200,,31,5.4
7565640,5,B01995ZOR0,This movie has two of the biggest stars out there in Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston. From start to finish I literally laughed every other minute. The plot is simple and I am sure it has been done before. With that being said it is still a great movie and has plenty of laughs for everybody. This is actually the first time that this movie has been released on Blu-ray in the US. Any other version is from another country or is a bootleg. The movie has excellent video and audio quality has pretty much the same extras as the DVD counterpart. For less than $10 it's a steal!,1458259200,,575,4.284403669724771

8744511,5,B01995ZOR0,"This movie is a classic Stiller movie. Jokes are well timed. The shots were done with care and passion. Philip Seymour crushed it (RIP...it wasn't suicide!). Also, Kevin Hart makes his early cinema appearence (not funny to me but whatevs). An excellent and timeless comedy. Ben is the man!",1510444800,,289,4.918367346938775
