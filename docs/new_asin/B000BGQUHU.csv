8086426,1,B000BGQUHU,The description was for a 1992 movie about a girl who writes to a serial killer; Staring Mary Frann.  What I got was this -- a 1977 movie with Joan Collins as a stripper.  We didn't watch it!  I gave it one star just so I could warn other viewers.  Amazon was kind enough to refund my payment and told me they would report the issue.,1403568000,,333,4.0
