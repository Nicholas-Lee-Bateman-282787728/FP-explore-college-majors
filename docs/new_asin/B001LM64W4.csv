It's nice to see that Titus has not only pulled through but also has triumphed, and has a sense of humor about it too.  This was a hilarious show and presents a lot of hope!",1235174400,,345,4.134328358208955
3686867,5,B001LM64W4,"For those of you who saw this on comedy central, they took away so much! I was not at the show, but know some people who were.. this DVD is going to be worth it, comedy central left out so much.

Titus is back off his divorce and with a new hottie who ""[......]"", lol. This show will take you for a roller coaster of laughs, Titus style. Talking about what he learned of love and divorce, he gives us lessons on many different things: how to ruin a relationship, how to keep one, how to spice it up, how to analyze it, and how to make it last.

I have been waiting for this since ""Norman Rockwell is Bleeding"", and I was not disappointed at all; this was funny as hell. Although.. it might get a bad rap cause he does not talk about his family as much, so take those comments with a grain of salt.

Welcome back Titus, we missed you.",1235001600,2,833,4.067073170731708
3686868,5,B001LM64W4,"This is hilarious!  Some friends and I went to this show when they filmed it and it is true Titus.  Coming off his divorce and with stories to tell this is a must see for all people in, out and done with relationships.",1234224000,2,218,4.046511627906977
3686869,5,B001LM64W4,"Hard to give a review on something not released yet but I will ;) (never been first to review something is why I am jumping the gun lol)....anyway, I am only writing this because if it's even half as good as his CD's are it is worth the 5 star review in my opinion! On a side note I wish his other shows that were shown on Comedy Central were released on dvd also. I will be buying this when it is released & am sure I will not be dissapointed.

3686983,3,B001LM64W4,"Titus's performance here wasn't nearly as good as ""Norman Rockwell's Bleeding"". I was a huge fan after that routine, but found ""Love is Evol""not up to par. It shouldI have been called ""Inner Retard"" because Titus goes to this inner character impersonation way too often during this performance. But frequency isn't the worst problem. The main issue is that his ""inner retard"" lines are somewhat funny initially, but after an hour they border annoying. Before buying this, I previewed the first 15 minutes on a video site and thought it was great. I should have watched it longer. It will probably never see the inside of a Blu-ray player again. Too bad. Titus can do berter.",1438214400,,674,4.818965517241379

3687109,5,B001LM64W4,Christopher Titus is a pure genius when it comes to comedy. There is nothing more I can say about this piece that it made me laugh to the point where I had tears in my eyes. He makes light of the sad things that go on in real life and the crappy things that happen to real people. I watched this with a very good understanding of what he was going to say and I still was so glad that I rented it. Made my whole day better. Totally worth the money and the time that I spent watching him. Absolutely worth it. Fox should give him another show..or maybe a network with a greater appreciation of greatness.,1401321600,,602,4.110169491525424

3687140,5,B001LM64W4,"Chris Titus is one of my favorite comedians for his dark humor. I have personally experienced a dysfunctional family and life myself. Though different from Mr. Titus, I completely get where he comes from in his special Love is Evol.

Coming from a Divorced family myself, it's refreshing to see a comedian go head on with the hell that typically comes with divorce. Especially from a dysfunctional family.

Now this special is not for everyone though. Some people who may not understand what it's like dealing with a divorce, or people who simply do not like jokes with dark humor or sexual undertones, this would be a special to avoid. However, if you can watch this special it is not only funny but rewarding.",1389312000,,711,4.725806451612903

I did have a issue just like one reviewer with Titus's ""inner retrard"" bit, but as for rest of the show I was amazed and couldn't help but smile and laugh out loud.  So if your into busting a gut and never stop laughing threwout a comedy show then pick this up and enjoy joke after joke on every issue from marriage to divorce, to dating and so forth.  One of the best parts for me was when he said he filled for divorce on June 6, 2006... bit i couldn't help but laugh.

3687251,5,B001LM64W4,"I've been following Chris Titus for years now....since his first special ""Norman Rockwell is Bleeding"" came out.  I love hearing about his dysfunctional life. Makes my own feel not so crazy.

This particular special is my absolute favorite of his because I think we all have been in relationships that just plain sucked. Ones where we either blamed ourselves for the crap that we went though even though it really wasn't our fault OR where we just took so much crap for years that finally after realizing we were better than that had enough and got out.  Whatever the circumstances may be he always puts a hilarious spin on very UNFUNNY situations.  That's what I love about him and that's why I've been a loyal Chris Titus fan for a long time now and will remain so!!",1331769600,,768,4.583941605839416
3687252,5,B001LM64W4,"I still haven't found my own ice cream truck, but that doesn't mean there isn't hope. Titus can take the ugliest parts of a relationship situation and find the funniest *bleep* in it and still find a way not to sugar coat it.

It's like  the familiar saying, 'if you don't laugh, you cry'.  And if you can laugh about it, then there may be some hope yet.

Oh, and his inner retard act rocks!",1327968000,,391,4.173333333333333

3687256,4,B001LM64W4,"When it comes to DVDs, it's safe to say that stand-up performances form an important cross section of my collection. From classic mainstays like George Carlin and Robin Williams to more recent acts like Jim Gaffigan the bases are pretty well covered. Still, I don't think any catalog is complete without Christopher Titus hopping from personal experience to personal experience pointing out how strained our lives have become within the never-ending vacuum known as society.

In his third outing, Chris quickly amends the insanity that made Norman Rockwell Is Bleeding and The 5th Annual End Of The World Tour successful with his various tales of marital discord. Whereas the aforementioned shows focused on a variety of topics while using a dedicated cast of ""players,"" Love is Evol is a little more focused in its pursuits. It goes without saying that divorce and the situations surrounding it are often ugly, but it's a joy to see it tackled as it is here, where it is knocked to the ground and righteously smothered with a pillow.

The real treat is this experience fails to get heavy handed. While one can't say these moments are an outright flaw of Titus' shows, it is awkward how these segments of personal evaluation stop a routine on a dime despite their noble intention. Love is Evol also makes a small gain that's in direct correlation to the faults in the recently released Neverlution! Again, I can't say what is exactly to blame for the perceived hesitation in that special but is helps bolster this show against its slightly superior predecessors.

As odd as it may sound given this is a review for the DVD, the real question that surrounds Love is Evol is whether to opt for the DVD or the audio recording. While Chris has a much better stage presence than someone like Jim Gaffigan (who is so stoic throughout his performances it isn't even funny) I have to suggest the audio recording. In general, the more portable you can make Titus the better although there are obvious exceptions - Norman Rockwell Is Bleeding greatly benefits from its video even though the audio is good on its own. Regardless of which path you choose, Love is Evol is more than capable of holding its own if you're willing to listen.",1316304000,,2224,4.771428571428571

at first to give to our youngest son 24, but realized the lady in his life would not allow him to view or keep it. We plan to share viewing with him and his siblings at different times because he is
very involved in his development of the drama of the situations he feels able to share. The Disc itself came in good condition. We ordered 1 and never received it so we after about 3 weeks reordered and it came by UPS instead of USPS which is how the orignal order was to be sent.
We laugh when we talk about it.

3687319,3,B001LM64W4,"I so wanted to like this more than I did after all Titus is a very pretty man and funny.  There are laughs but underneath this guy is sinking not overcoming and to find out his sister committed suicide too, is a lot to overcome.  The show is disjointed (could be editing), the segues are clumsy and he's preachy.  The last one scares me because if anyone did follow his advice they need to re-watch this and see that everything he complains about are things he's currently doing (the saddest part of all, that and it's seem like he maybe drinking again).  He does, very briefly, reveal that he's ""funny with a thin layer of charm covering huge arrogance"" so you might just want take his advice with a grain of salt.

I did enjoy the show but I came away wishing I hadn't watched it and instead just popped in one of my old Titus DVD's.  It was like seeing a favorite relative in the hospital before they die.  It wasn't a bad thing to do but part of me still wishes I could just remember him the way he was.

When I feel the need to pray for a rich, good looking, talented, white guy with a hot girl friend living in the U.S., I think it's safe to say this is not a feel good show...but only if you think about it.",1282176000,4,1214,4.136170212765958

Again, I laughed my *** off! Decided I needed to get this one to share. Sent a copy to my son who is still new in the 'relationship' world - so he can see what he's in for.

The bit about apologizing for getting stabbed really struck a chord.

Anyways, this was a HUGE improvement over his 5th annual End of the World Tour, and though not as entertaining as Norman Rockwell is Bleeding, his comedic style remains spot-on.

I even saw him perform live when he was in town and he made me laugh from beginning to end. Titus really shows there IS humor in some of the most ugly situations we go through in life. Some people say he goes too far, but that's the point of dark and satire comedy.

So if you come from a dysfunctional family or if you know what it's like to break up with the one you love - or loved - on REALLY bad terms; you will laugh too.",1246665600,2,521,3.869158878504673

He makes you aware of the ""real"" emotions he experienced in his personal saga and at the same time gives you permission to laugh with him about them.
He has the ability to bounce in and out of different characters when telling a story with facial expressions that are so animated and convincing, you think more than one person is talking.
Anyone who ever had a family, has known a family, or been in a love relationship will find this DVD highly entertaining.",1246320000,,609,4.691588785046729

But then again, he didn't get married in the show either.  I remember going to one of his ""5th Annual End of the World"" tour shows in TExas.  When my dad and I went home that night, and the next morning, the radio was talking about Chris and Erin's divorce.  Wow, what a moment to revisit with this special.

IF you're thinking, could my son or daughter see this?  Even though it's an hour and twenty three minutes, he just has a few ""f"" words, and [....] gets thrown around a few times too.  Other than that, it's not as dirty as one would think with a special like this.

Considering the show itself, it's awesome.  I've seen Christopher Titus once live, and I would love to see him again.  Highly recommended for a Christopher Titus fan!",1235433600,13,972,4.410112359550562
