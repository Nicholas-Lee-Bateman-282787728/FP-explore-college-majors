7845790,2,6303418406,"This could have been a nice tribute to some cherished comedians, but it fails to live up to its billing.  The jacket blurb claims it shows the famous ""Who's On First"" routine in its entirety.  Not only is this false, the part they do show has canned laughter dubbed over it. This was, unfortunately, the way you probably saw Abbott & Costello movies on the old movie channel when you were growing up.  But the unnecessary and joy-killing laugh track could have been removed for this documentary tribute.  No other routine is shown for anymore than a few seconds.  I pine for the Susquehanna Hat routine or Niagra Falls, but I'll have to find them in their original films (if I can find them without the obnoxious laugh track).  Seinfeld's commentary is sadly unfunny and one wonders why he did such obviously weak material.",1184112000,,823,4.680555555555555
7845791,5,6303418406,"They teamed up in 1931 and in less than four years became box-office comedy sensations. Award-winning comedian and longtime fan, Jerry Seinfeld, hosts this intimate and very funny look at the world's most famous comedy team ever, Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. From burlesque to Broadway to radio to film and finally, television, straight man Bud Abbott and his hilarious sidekick, Lou Costello won the hearts of America. Especially during the particularly difficult years of World War II, their special chemistry provided a steady stream of comic relief that would last over 21 years. Tak a never-before-seen journey into their private lives via the stars' own home movies, interviews with their children and rare behind-the-scenes footage. Seinfeld also introduces routines from their most popular films including ""WHO'S ON FIRST"" from ""THE NAUGHTY NINETIES"" for which shooting was extremely difficult because the film crew could not stop laughing! This video is indeed a rare treasure that pays special homage to the remarkable legacy of the funniest duo of all time.",1150848000,,1068,5.325443786982248
7845792,5,6303418406,"""I grew up on these guys,"" says host Jerry Seinfeld and, for anyone else who did (or wished they did), this is essential Abbott & Costello viewing.

Some of their best routines--including a complete performance of the classic ""Who's On First?""--are featured here along with hilarious outtakes from their TV appearances and home movie footage.

This needs to be on DVD!",1091750400,3,368,5.016393442622951
7845793,5,6303418406,"He isn't the greatest sitcom actor of all time, but he certainly does know how to present a great performance. This also includes the historical performances of Abbott & Costello. From start to finish, using his uncanny style of humour, Jerry presents a story of success, comedy and history in the making. Now documentries aren't really by keg of beer but there is something special and unique about this programme. From the moment I pressed ""play"", to the closing credits, I got a sense of self assurance that this was going to be a great show. I'm close to buying a second copy of this video as I think I may have worn out my own copy! Being both a fan of Seinfeld and Abbott & Costello, this video was a great night in! BUY IT. BUY IT NOW!!!!",969667200,16,745,4.366906474820144
