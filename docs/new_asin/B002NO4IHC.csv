8375231,4,B002NO4IHC,"This DVD gave a good overview of Oscar Peterson both as a performer and the human being who created so much enjoyment. Like the Erroll Garner ""No One Can Hear You Read"" bio-DVD, having a context for the corpus of this legendary man's output is satisfying indeed.",1436486400,,262,4.595744680851064

8375233,5,B002NO4IHC,"This is an outstanding tribute to one of the most profound, prolific and gifted jazz artist in 20th century.  Oscar Peterson was one of my favorite jazz musicians.  This video gives him the credit and recognition he deserved.",1406246400,,225,4.894736842105263

8375235,4,B002NO4IHC,"For Oscar Peterson fans this is an excellent DVD. However, if you already own the Music in the Key of Oscar, as I do, save your money.  Large sections on both DVDs are the same thing.  In a way I considered this a bit of a rip off.  But as they say, buyer beware.",1375228800,2,263,3.8333333333333335
8375236,5,B002NO4IHC,"~ This DVD serves as an excellent overview of Oscar Peterson's life - not just his career.
~ Filmed not long before his death in 2007, the story line not only covers his career from a historical perspective, but it also answers the question ""who was Oscar Peterson?"" Interviews with family members and friends as well as in-depth discussions with Peterson himself provide valuable insights into OP's character and what made him excel. He talks with great admiration about his father, mother, and siblings. He talks openly about racism. He talks about the positive and negative impacts of his constant traveling on his career and family life. More than many documentaries, this excellent film provides the viewer with a glimpse into the inner sanctum of the artist himself.
~ There are several segments of concert footage, but this is not a concert film. There are several other videos available that show OP in concert.
~ The bonus features are interesting and informative.
~ Highly recommended for fans of the great Oscar Peterson.",1364774400,,1032,5.005813953488372
8375237,5,B002NO4IHC,"When listening to the extensive catalog of Oscar Peterson's recorded performances, one tends to forget that he was a human with a history of struggle against acceptance.  Being Canadian made him somewhat of an outsider in the American Jazz scene.  Being black made him find himself unwanted in the segregated sections of the United States.  His concert and touring career caused him difficulties in trying to keep a family life going.  Working for several years with a white guitarist in his trio brought him criticism from his black audience.

This DVD shows him finally achieving peace in his later years, honored by his home country, united with his family.  Along the way, there are many glimpses of the varying stages of his performing career.  Having always been in awe of his creativity and technical skill, it was good to see the human side of Oscar and to find myself even more fully appreciating his art because of it.",1317513600,,928,4.8354430379746836
8375238,5,B002NO4IHC,"This DVD shows the hardships Oscar has had to combat during his career and personal life.
For those who want to hear him play or watch his hands hover over the keys, you won't find much of that.
It tries to demonstrate a some what scattered time line from start to present with a unique, although very small, glimpse into the Peterson's family life.
I do know that my true love for this Jazz God was only enhanced after watching this DVD.
There is a small segment in the DVD where Oscar tells how he watched his father in one of his performances. The way he sat there in the audience watching the trio, but mainly looking at his son Oscar, face filled with pride. Oscar was happy that his father had got to see him climb to fame. At that moment I swear I had tears in my eyes.

A wonderful person and an excellent DVD.",1312675200,4,818,4.210191082802548
