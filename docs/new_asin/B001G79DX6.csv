3597305,2,B001G79DX6,Well it's certainly not as good as or as bad as some of the reviews imply but save for one or two episodes it's only worthy for camp value. Haven't wathced them all yet. No really big stars in them save for Rip Torn's excellent narration but they've been good for putting me and my girlfriend in the right mood for sleep. The price is right. Close but no cigar.,1261958400,3,361,4.171428571428572
3597306,5,B001G79DX6,"For those of you who remember the old packaging for ghost stories-5 disc edition, this is the same product with the same episodes as the former.  Some of these include Cold in the Grave, Landscape of Lost Dreams, and Mirror Mirror.  The only thing this packaging of Ghost Stories has is 4 new episodes. That is it.  This product had no  description and was kind of deceiving with a different cover.",1257724800,25,398,4.563380281690141

3597308,5,B001G79DX6,`I love this dvd of Ghost stories very much. I watched it as a series in the eighties and I still enjoy watching it. I give it a five star rating and would recommend it to whomever enjoys haunted movies.,1395446400,,203,4.1
3597309,2,B001G79DX6,i would recommend not watching this around kids mine had nightmares and kept us up and now will not sleep without a light on,1378252800,,124,4.208333333333333
3597310,1,B001G79DX6,"I enjoy documentaries about the paranormal as well as investigative type dvd's..  When it said hosted by Rip Torn I assumed it was a documentary type dvd however all it turned out to be is nothing but scary stories, not my thing.  Those ghost hunter lovers out there: not a hunter type movie  nor does it involve narrations.  Would not buy other dvd's of this series.",1366329600,7,367,4.515151515151516
3597311,5,B001G79DX6,i purchased this as a replacement for my friend because I scratched hers. it is in great condition. she never knew...lol,1361836800,,120,4.761904761904762
3597312,1,B001G79DX6,"I am so extreamly dissapointed! This is the exact same set Ive bought ao have already! It just has a totally different picture on the cover. The other cover has what it looks to be a ghost face of a man screaming on the front. Im going to look for it to see what that 1s called. Different nam, different picture, but all the same copy! I was trick, duped, ripped off. Upset because I really wanted to sot down & watch something new. Look into this before buying it, so it doesnt happen to u. Also not a great set of stories. They r all fake, not real documentory stuff, not scary, more commical than anything else, but realy just low buget & dumb. Thats why I was even more depressed to find out I was sent the same stupid boring fake not real lame stories, I unfortunatly already own. Now I own 2 sets of this bull :(",1360713600,,818,4.11875
3597313,4,B001G79DX6,"nice bunch of stores,some even gave me the willies..i'd rate this dvd with a b-,i've seen so many ghost stores...so i may be a bit jaded..and need the real scary ghost stories to get to me..but again its not a bad bunch..so grab the pop corn,candy,soda..and your mate..turn the light off,turn the sound up..and get ready for some nice goose bumps..and some great hugs from your mate...BOOOOOOOOOO!!",1352073600,,398,4.955223880597015
3597314,5,B001G79DX6,"First of all,this isn't what I thought it would be, documentary type true stories.  I was a little disappointed at first since I wanted another collection of ghost stories like ""A Haunting"" series from Discovery Channel.  But after watching these, I have to say it's really good.  The stories are interesting, scary and fun to watch.  These stories remind me a lot of ""Tales From the Darkside"" and ""The Twilight Zone"".  If  you like a good scare without the gore, then this is for you.  I'm a huge fan of horror movies, and tv shows like X-Files, Ghost Hunters, Ghost Adventurers and Paranormal State and I like this collection.  Sure it's low budget and the special effects can be a bit cheesy at times, but the stories are A+ and the acting isn't bad either.  A nice collection for fans of ghost stories.",1338249600,,806,4.580419580419581
3597315,1,B001G79DX6,"Seriously, I must have watched around 3 episodes and thought they were terrible. What a waste of time. The critics who LOVE this must not be on the right wavelength!!!! I was kinda hoping for the 'A Haunting' style of docos, but these truly are a waste of time..... Terrible cheap stories and they're only 20 mins long at best...Rubbish!!!!",1326499200,,340,4.683333333333334
3597316,3,B001G79DX6,"The title is misleading, as these stories are more in line with Tales from the Crypt rather than being stories about hauntings.  The acting is overdone/poorly done in parts, but the attempt at direction for many of these stories makes it worth a viewing. The stories vary enough to keep the series interesting. For the price, the series makes for decent tv junk food.",1321488000,,367,4.734375
3597317,5,B001G79DX6,"I purchased ""Haunted-Ghost Stories"" first from one of my local stores, and really enjoyed it.  I actually started researching Amazon for more episodes when I came across this box set.

I'm always looking for good horror stories- not gory stories.

If your looking for scary stories, then you might want to keep looking.  I can only recall one episode that actually scared me. However, it is very entertaining.

Pros:

1) You can sit and watch it with the entire family
2) Absolutely no nudity or vulgar language from what I can recall
3) The story plots were good
4) No gory scenes ( This is what makes up a lot of scary movies in recent years.  Gory does not equate to scary)

Cons:
1) Low budget
2) No real stars (if this can really be considered a con)
3) Acting was a bit amateur

FYI: As I mentioned earlier, I have ""Haunted-Ghost stories"", That particular disk contain all episodes from the 1st two disk  of this 6DVD box set.",1311552000,2,932,4.461538461538462
3597318,3,B001G79DX6,"I thought this dvd would be more comparable to a ""Rose Red"" or ""Changeling"" styled movie, but in reality it is more like ""Unsolved Mysteries"".",1302480000,5,142,4.72
3597319,5,B001G79DX6,"I loved this horror anthology when it was first syndicated in 1997. Back then, I taped it on Beta (yes, I know).

I've since bought both the 40 episode DVD set, and then the 44 episode set (yes, a ripoff for selling the earlier set without all the episodes).

This show has a low-budget, TV feel, which works well for TV horror.  A low budget forces the makers to focus on story and acting, rather than rely on special effects.

(This show's special effects are the sort of 1990s computer CGI effects found on The New Outer Limits -- the effects LOOK like computer effects, which don't match the ""look"" of the live action shots.)

The stories are pare for horror anthologies.  Some great and original tales, some so-so, some stale and dull.  The usual ""box of chocolates.""

I disagree with another reviewer about the acting quality.  Unlike most TV horror anthologies, there are NO ""name actors"".  Not even any recognizable B actors.  Even so, I was especially impressed by the acting quality.  Many of the actors did excellent work.  Not all of them, but many.

Let's clear this up: This show did NOT debut on the Fox Family channel, despite what it says on the DVD box.  It was syndicated in 1997.  I even have the show's press kit from back then, touting their upcoming second season (which was not to be).

Maybe it appeared on the Fox Family Channel, but I suspect it was after its initial syndicated run.

Finally, the 44 episode DVD edition says that it includes 4 ""never before seen"" episodes.  NOT TRUE.  The earlier set didn't include these 4 episodes.  And perhaps the Fox Family Channel didn't air them.  But they were included in the syndication run.  I SAW them, and I still have them on my Beta tapes of the show.

Hardcore fans of low-budget, TV horror anthologies, who don't mind seeing many of the same old tropes (people who don't realize they're dead; greedy murderers or adulterers who get their comeupance, etc.), should enjoy this show.",1300752000,13,1959,4.627906976744186
3597320,1,B001G79DX6,"The acting of the stories are really pathetic!!! I cant believe they hired cheap, pathetic actors/actresses in the recreation of each episode, why cant they find someone who can act a little. If you ever compare to ""A Haunting"" Series, it is major disappointment....although some of the story lines are pretty well written. I will never buy the whole DVDs set if I knew it was suck!..",1291161600,,384,4.746268656716418
3597321,4,B001G79DX6,"This is a very entertaining set of videos, some cheesey acting is expected as these are all done in the style of the show, The Twighlight Zone. Each story comes with some intro narration and ends with a lesson learned. So its good fun for young teens or Halloween, strange subject matter, weird happenings and ghosts.",1290124800,,317,4.678571428571429
3597322,4,B001G79DX6,"This is a great collection of ghost stories. The plots of many of these stories will have you on the edge of your seat. It is a shame that no network brings episodes of these shows on anymore, but I am glad that someome put them all on a collection of DVDs. This is worth the purchase!",1285977600,,285,4.017543859649122

3597324,5,B001G79DX6,"As a long-time fan of the TV horror/supernatural anthology series, I would say that, although obscure, Ghost Stories ranks high in this genre! Just think of the great series, like Rod Serling's Twilight Zone and Night Gallery, or the 1980's Twilight Zone resurrection; how about Tales From the Darkside; or to some extent Tales From the Crypt [although not nearly as gory]--well Ghost Stories has similarities of all of these! Now, add the opening narration by Rip Torn, and episode specific intro and outro narration--again similar to The Twilight Zone or even The [more sci-fi oriented] Outer Limits, and you have MOST of the elements for a great anthology series.

I say MOST because threre's one great difference between the above mentioned icon shows and Ghost Stories; the actors appearing in Ghost Stories are all mostly unknown, much like that of daytime soap operas. But that doesn't make this series weak at all. The performances are strong and convincing. The writing and teleplays are clever and to the point with many surprises, twists and turns, quite reminisint to another great series: Alfred Hitchcock Presents. The characters and storylines are well developed but not complicated [which usually makes or breaks such a series considering each episode is only about 20 minutes].

The high production quality, and no-nonsense story-telling makes this an enjoyable viewing experience, episode after episode. Of course some episodes are better than others, but I have thoroughly enjoyed all 44 of them--unlike the [many versions of] The Twilight Zone and all of the series which have many outstanding episodes augmented with several clunkers. With Ghost Stories, the episodes compliment each other so that you come to expect a fairly simple, but decent supernatural plot with a lot of great ideas that makes you eager to see the next episode. There are some special effects where necessary, but for most of the stories, special effects aren't needed for a great story.

It is interesting that this show was made for and played on the Fox Family Channel, as, in my opinion, most of these stories are not family oriented, that is, not suitable for, well at least pre-teens.  Perhaps this is what kept Ghost Stories from proceeding to become a longer running and more well known show. Oh well!

By the way, this 6 DVD set is the only one you would want. There is a five disc set that excludes four episodes, and there are other single DVDs entitled Haunted: Ghost Stories. Apparently the parent company, Echo Bridge Entertainment bought and re-released these titles from Platinum Disc. This 6 disc set is well worth the price! Enjoy!",1266278400,,2643,5.025114155251141
3597325,3,B001G79DX6,"This was not what I was expecting. All throughout each disk the stories became
more and more predictable. Although most of the episodes kept me on the edge
of my seat, I was a bit disappointed that they were staged.
If you like the ""Twilight Zone"" you'll love these flicks, which is what they
reminded me of.",1265500800,,308,4.421052631578948
3597326,3,B001G79DX6,"As the previous reviewer said, this is the same set as the previous release with the exception of 4 additional episodes not included originally.  This addition completes the series.  If you bought the old set and are a completist you will have to buy this for the missing 4 episodes.  Kind of a screw job.",1264550400,,305,4.509090909090909
3597327,4,B001G79DX6,"When I ordered this, I thought it was a documentary compiled of true ghost stories.  I was disappointed at first, but the stories are actually quite entertaining. They are interesting and fun without being unnecessarily gory, which for me is a big plus.",1262995200,2,253,4.883720930232558

8304194,5,B001G79DX6,"I enjoyed this collection of ghost stories when I first saw them aired on T.V.  Each half hour story deals with all aspects of the supernatural. These stories will stay in your mind, particularly the young woman who decides to resume a flight to Florida that was fatally interrupted by the plane crash which killed all passengers, including her husband and child. The woman was the only survivor. But once aboard the plane she begins to see the spirits of some of the dead passengers. These stories will scare you. Rip Torn's voice over adds to the chill, certainlythe opening titles. 'A place of boundless dread' ' Where those who dwell, dwell alone.' Enjoy. But keep the lights on.
