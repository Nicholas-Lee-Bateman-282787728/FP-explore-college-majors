8719607,5,B00Z8BNB66,"This is, hands down the best item I've purchased in 2015 for music! This band just lights it up from start to finish. I've listened to Alain for a number of years, and I wanted to hear drummer Damien Schmitt in this setting... I was not familiar with guitarist Pierre Cote and keyboardist John Roney... Let me say that these gentlemen do not disappoint in the least! These 4 musicians are locked tight and their brand of jazz fusion is a breath of fresh air! You should have bought this 5 minutes ago! A masterpiece! Merci Mr. Caron!!",1450224000,4,534,4.459183673469388
