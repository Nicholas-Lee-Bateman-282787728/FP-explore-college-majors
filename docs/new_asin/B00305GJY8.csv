8515199,4,B00305GJY8,"I saw this listed on a FaceBook page for Nation Train Day. I'm a train enthusiast, so a movie about a cross-country train trip sounded very cool. Needless to say I really enjoyed this movie. It was very interesting and creative and I'd recommend it. Real people don't know they are acting, but play the roles. Like I said, cool concept.",1273276800,3,336,4.524590163934426
8515200,5,B00305GJY8,I was impressed with this film.  It was innovative and nothing like I have seen before.  What got me the most is the impoact the filming of this movie had on the unsuspected actors aboard the train.  They seemed to really care for these two people at a crossroads in their relationship.  It was refreshing to see the good in others and the varying opinions they all held about love and relationships.  Definite see.,1265068800,2,415,4.554054054054054
8515201,4,B00305GJY8,"I have been experiencing a real difficulty in watching any film these days, they just do not hold my attention. Railed was different. Very refreshing, witty, moving. I recommend this film!!!!!",1261008000,,192,5.225806451612903
8515202,4,B00305GJY8,"I saw ""Railed"" at a film festival and was interested to see what ""reality film-making"" was all about. Woah! After hearing the director speak after he screening, I just could not believe how much of this movie is entirely unscripted. That's what makes it unique. It doesn't feel like other dramas, there's an edginess to it that you just have to see in order to understand. Combine a standard plot premise with real people and the twists and turns in this movie are unexpected and exciting. I bought a copy of this on DVD in order to preserve the moment.",1260835200,3,553,4.54
8515203,5,B00305GJY8,"Truly a fresh and interesting film!"" Shows you a new perspective that you won't want to miss out on. Hopefully there will be more to come from the unique mind of Ryan Fox.",1260403200,,171,4.212121212121212
8515204,5,B00305GJY8,"We need more fresh minds out there like that of the movie's director, Mr. Fox. Through the film's unorthodox and unique style, the darker side of human experience is explored as a consequence of the genuine, witty, and compassionate interactions of those real people, unaware, that become involved in the story.  It opens a whole new door to the way films can be made...and the impact they have on an audience that is looking for that ""something more...""",1260230400,2,454,4.82051282051282
8515205,5,B00305GJY8,"It feels like nobody takes risks in independent film anymore, so after hearing this concept I had to check it out. Director Ryan Fox is a true visionary and I can't wait to see what he does next.",1260230400,,195,4.157894736842105
