8425222,5,B00005MKJ6,"This story is a quiet tale of two cousins (mice) who live apart.  One in the country (Crystal Gayle's character) and one in the city (John Lithgow's character).  The story is all about ""it's not what you have or where you are, it's who you are with and love!""  I've shared this story with my daughter and you can't beat the two Christmas songs Crystal sings during the story.  Beautiful songs, beautiful story!",1153440000,,410,4.575342465753424
