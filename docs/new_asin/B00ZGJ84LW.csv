7282152,3,B00ZGJ84LW,"God appoints a time for our birth and a time for our death. It's what we do with the dash in between that makes a difference in the life of a believer. Word Films introduces their latest DVD, Find A Way, which features an all-star high school football player, Smiley Cain, has it all together both on and off the field. Not only is he well known, but he is an all around guy. One who wears his faith as much as he wears his football jersey. Never one to turn down helping out someone in need from someone named ""Stick"" who is getting bullied, to a young girl, Casey who has just been broken up with my her boyfriend because she doesn't seem to have the right look. Not only that he inspires and encourages his teammate and best friend Nick Whitefield, the coaches son, who dreams of following his passion in music over playing football like his dad wants.

Then one day, Smiley doesn't wake up and is immediately rushed to the hospital where the town takes stock in their own lives. From Casey who is watching her family fall apart while she is struggling to come to terms with her recent break up and now watching the one man who had faith in her struggle to survive while he is in the hospital. Her mother is simply too busy with her career and her older sister has plans that involve pursuing her own career with shopping at the mall for the latest in fashions. Her father is struggling to keep the family together but it seems like it is all in vain.

The coaches family faces a similar situation when Nick's mom overhears his father talk down to him about his music career telling him it's a waste of time. When she attempts to correct her husband, he reminds her where her place is in the family and that is of a wife and nothing more. Soon she wonders if divorce from him, might just be the best thing for the family. Finding faith in the midst of difficult circumstances is the theme in this movie.

I received Find A Way from Word Films compliments of Edify Media Inc and Word Films for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review, aside from a free copy of this DVD and the opinions contained here are my own honest personal ones. I would have liked to see this movie made from a higher quality film company because the edits on this one were pretty bad on both the sound and focus issues in certain scenes. The sad thing is that this is meant to have a great impact and with the acting portrayed by the people in this film, you find it hard to truly care about any of the characters in this story. This is based on the true story of Harry Cohen, which should have been the true star of the movie and unfortunately for this reviewer and her family, it fell far short of our expectations. For this reason, I would rate this one a 3 out of 5 stars in my opinion.",1440720000,2,2811,4.260299625468165

7282154,5,B00ZGJ84LW,"There are a few Christian movies that just aren't very good, but Find A Way sure isn't one of them. This is a very powerful, thought-provoking DVD.  I was riveted to my seat wondering how everything would turn out. Inspired by a true story.
  You will really like Smiley {Harry}  he is such a kind, sweet, gentle but strong Christian. Everyone he meets becomes his instant friend. He will help anyone and everyone.
  Then the unthinkable happens Smiley a high school Senior suddenly dies.
This DVD shows us how one life can affect so many people. How Smiley makes a difference in so many lives.
  Find a Way is such a touching, heart-rending show. It gives you such hope and compassion. It will make you think and bring a tear to your eye.
  In this movie we see how his death helps and affects so many people and families. Some on the edge of life changes and horrible mistakes.
  I believe this should be the movie of the year. Really, really good and I highly recommend it.

8720181,4,B00ZGJ84LW,"Movies that are based on true stories always pack a bigger punch - especially ones that are based on a tragedy. Smiley is the amazing football player that is everyone's friend. He stands up to the bully pushing around a smaller kid. He befriends the girl who has just broken up with her boyfriend and assures her she IS worth it and she IS beautiful. He encourages his friend who would rather be making music than making plays on the football field. And for a teenager, he even has a good relationship with his parents. Sadly, this is based on truth and the movie follows the impact Smiley had on all of the people around him (young and old) once he dies. I highly recommend watching. It does a great job showing the impact one well-lived life can have on a community.",1465516800,,768,4.415492957746479

8720186,4,B00ZGJ84LW,"Harry or as everyone calls him, Smiley is everyone's friend. He is a the high school team's star football player, a good guy who would do harm to no one. He cares about his family, friends, life and God. He's the guy who will even taking a cross off his own neck to give to a friend because she needs to find hope in her situation. Smiley has his whole future in front of him. He is on the cover of local papers, everyone knows Smiley will play college football and obviously eventually go pro. He has the world at his feet.

One day Smiley doesn't wake up. I don't think we even know why this young man just dies. His family, friends and town are floored and do what they can to make sense of his untimely death.

Loosely based on a true story about a H.S. football player Harry Cohen this movie focuses on the lives of others. The football couches father wants his son to play football but he wants to sing. Another friend's parents are separating, everyone is losing faith.  Like all feel good  movies, characters must move through the pain to come out stronger on the other side.

The only downside was that Cranston Johnson (Smiley) isn't in the movie for long. Wish we could have seen him more",1443139200,3,1199,4.334821428571429
8720187,1,B00ZGJ84LW,"Excellent!!! This young producer is certainly on his way.  He is innovative and thinking outside the box when it comes to putting together a film that not only deals with reality but with an underlying truth of the need many of us have a yearn for, but don't know where exactly to turn to.",1442188800,,289,4.351851851851852
8720188,3,B00ZGJ84LW,"Thank you Edify Media for this review DVD.
Find a Way is the story of a young man who was star of the high school football team who simply didn't wake up one Sunday morning. It is also the story of a number of other family and community members who are coping with this tragedy and personal tragedies as well.

Find a Way had some interesting elements, but to be truthful, if I hadn't been watching it for review, I may not have finished it. It didn't really keep my interest. It seemed too scattered for me. Some of the acting was stilted, some of the characters downright irritating, and it was just altogether sad. Of course, the main character, the bright spot in the whole movie and in their lives, dies. Everyone is dealing with that as well as their own problems. It wasn't bad, but not great either, in my opinion.

I know this isn't much of a review, but, to be truthful, I can't really say go buy this movie and watch it. It was different than other football movies, but I still didn't enjoy it. I think that they were trying to show how God can bring good from bad circumstances. But, as my fourteen year old daughter said, ""It's like they set up all these problems then sprinkled a little pixie dust, and they were all fixed.""",1440892800,,1238,4.331896551724138
