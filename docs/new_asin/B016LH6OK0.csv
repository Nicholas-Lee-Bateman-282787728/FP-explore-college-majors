8736734,4,B016LH6OK0,I was really looking forward to trying this DVD as I have just started using massage balls. I received this within the time promised and it was packaged nicely. I like to get instructional DVD's that I can learn the different moves and use them in my own workout / post workout routine. This DVD had clear instructions and was easy to follow. The DVD did not come with a roller ball and the one in the video was different than the one I have. Although I don't think that is a huge deal as I could use mine with a few differences it really should have included one with the DVD. It seems a little odd that it wouldn't especially when it goes for about 10 dollars. This is the type of DVD that usually comes with the product it is instructing you to use. That said I found it helpful in using a roller ball and the instructions were clear and easy to understand. I will definitely incorporate the things from the DVD into my workout and recovery. It had some good ideas and helpful techniques for using a roller ball.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. All of my reviews are 100% my opinion good or bad. I rely on others reviews when buying a product so I am honest in my own reviews.,1467676800,,1220,4.213675213675214
8736735,4,B016LH6OK0,"This is my third video with DanceCrazy and it did not disappoint.  It gives you clear directions and exercises on how to use a massage roller ball to reduce muscle pain and tension.  Since I am new to exercising and learning muscle groups I found this really helpful.  The video starts with a good warm up that can be used before any workout or just as a morning or evening stretching. Very similar to the stretches shown on their other videos.  Then the instructor demonstrates using the roller ball on each of the muscle groups.  The video is only about a half hour but you can see specific muscle groups to work the muscles that need it most.  I've been using these exercises on the opposite day of my workouts.  Example, if I work arms on Monday then I do the massager on Tuesday on only those muscle groups that might need some TLC.  I don't have the roller ball that the instructor is using but I've been using several different balls that I have around the house such as a spiked laundry ball, or a baseball.  Overall, I'm really grateful for this instructional guide and having tools that I need to take better care of my body.

8736736,4,B016LH6OK0,"I use massage balls and foam rollers regularly as part of my workout recovery plan. I find that when I am consistent, I remain more flexible and tend to get sore muscles less frequently and have fewer aches and pains.

I will say that using massage balls and foam rollers can be a workout in itself (getting into the positions often requires balance and core strength) and is usually somewhat painful when massaging tender and tight muscles. So it can take a little determination to make it a habit, but it pays off for me. (This is not intended as medical or professional advice, just sharing my experience).

This specific DVD is well produced, well lit, well chaptered and offers detailed yet clear instructions on using a muscle roller ball to massage several muscles that tend to get tight. Overall, I am pleased. It starts with a dynamic mobility warm-up and then works through massaging the whole body starting bottom moving to the top. These types of workout DVDs are never fun and usually seem a little tedious to me. I tend to use them a few times to learn the techniques then incorporate the exercises into my workout warmups and cooldowns to stay consistent.

I have a few DVD's that I consider to be pre-hab (hopefully preventing the need for rehabilitation exercises that a physical therapist might prescribe). Like other DVDs in this category, this is beneficial (I feel relaxed and flexible afterwards), but kind of dry and dull. For that reason, it is essential for these tutorials/workouts to be well chaptered so it is easy to reference the chapters addressing your needs that day. This DVD is well chaptered.

My only concern... I have two sets of massage balls but not the specific roller ball used in this DVD. The techniques can be adapted to the rubber balls or yoga balls (or LaCross balls). However, it features a specific ball so it does require some modification. I think it would be much more useful if it were sold in a set with the Dance crazy Massage Roller Ball.

I received a free review copy of this DVD. All experiences and opinions described are my own.",1459036800,,2090,4.683923705722071
8736737,4,B016LH6OK0,"I have a lot of muscle issues including extremely ropey muscles all through my traps. If I try to do arm circles or roll my shoulders back it makes an unsettling crunching noise. It's kind of gross.

I thought it would be interesting to review the Dance Crazy Trigger Point Massage DVD and see what kind of tips for trigger point massage I could gain from it.

The DVD length is about 30 minutes, although each motion is only showed unilaterally, so you need to add on extra time to do each side. The DVD is pretty basic. There is no music or anything, just a nice lady in a studio sitting on a chair and yoga mat like you would have at home and talking you through each movement.

The listing gives for this DVD doesn't indicate that the roller ball comes with the DVD, so it's not misleading, but it is sort of silly to not sell them as one set. I mean, I'm sure someone has a roller ball like this and would benefit from only buying the DVD and not having to buy the set, but it seems that the majority of people would be in the opposite scenario and need the roller ball.

Still, the warm up provided some nice stretch ideas that take just a few minutes and that I want to incorporate through my work days when I spend many hours at a desk.  And if you have a roller ball, want to buy their roller ball, or maybe even use any random tennis ball or something? this DVD could be helpful and give you some tips and guidance to get the best benefits.

I was sent this DVD for free to watch and review, but I was not sent a roller ball to use with it. :)",1458950400,,1553,4.075409836065574
8736738,1,B016LH6OK0,"When I was approved to review this DVD I also applied for the roller ball but also I only got one and not the other. So I have the dvd and not the machine that the DVD uses. Would have made more sense if I had both, then I could give a proper review.",1457481600,2,250,3.6481481481481484
