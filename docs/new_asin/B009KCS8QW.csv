8542441,4,B009KCS8QW,"For about a year now I've been exploring the cinema of Nazi Germany, partially out of curiosity as to what kind of movies were made under Hitler's regime, and partially because I've had a fancy for German cinema of any kind since I saw DAS BOOT as a kid. I've now seen about fifteen or twenty films from the Nazi era, but ""Standschtze Bruggler"" is my first ""mountain film."" I'm told that so-called ""Bergfilms"" are a subgenre unique to German cinema, so I was doubly curious to see what this movie offered in terms of both entertainment and camerawork. I'm pleased to report that this is a well-crafted and thoroughly enjoyable movie, which, despite its pro-war sentiments, is hardly more bombastic or propagandistic than similar movies made in the same period in Britain or America.

""Standschtze Bruggler"" begins in a small village in the Tyrol region of the Austro-Hungarian Empire during WW1. The war has taken most of the fighting-age men already and all who remain in the village are either women, pipe-smoking grandpas, or wet-behind-the-ears youngsters; the Italians, however, are pushing hard toward the village and it is necessary for every male who can carry a rifle to join up into the ""Standschtze,"" a sort of mountain militia. This includes Toni Bruggler (Ludwig Kerscher), a boy studying for the priesthood whose father recently fell at the front, his gramps Grossvater Bruggler (Rolf Pinegger), crusty old dog Hans Obwexer (Friedrich Ulmer) and most of Toni's young friends. Toni's pious, widowed mother (Franziska Kinz) is anguished that he has declined an exemption on religious grounds, but Toni is determined to serve his country and village at the front -- which happens to be in the mountains. He soon discovers that war ""up there"" is extremely arduous, what with the rain, the snow, the shortage of food and the enemy artillery, and after being shot by an Italian sniper ends up recuperating in a hospital run by the local baroness, Frau Hella von Teuff (Lola Chlud), who becomes his rather chaste love-interest for the rest of the movie, much to the displeasure of his mother. Returning to the front, Toni discovers much has changed: many of his friends have been killed and the Italians are planning a massive final offensive to break through the militiamen and take the village. Toni must navigate treacherous mountain slopes, storms of Italian bullets and the war of wills between Frau Teuff and his mother, all the while working on the question of where his true destiny lays -- with God, or the army?

""Standschtze Bruggler"" is a war movie with two distinguishing features. The first is that, being a Bergfilm, there is a great emphasis on using the awesome scenery of the Tyrolian Alps as a backdrop and even a character of sorts in the flick, since it is from the great mountains that Bruggler and his pals draw their identity. Director Werner Klinger tackles this with assurance, though the quality of the B & W print is not the best and much of the beauty and majesty of the mountains is lost or diminished by the dark, monochromatic images. The second is that as war movies go, there is less of an emphasis on big battles and action than with telling the story of Bruggler and the militiamen as they struggle to hold the line up where the rain doesn't have far to fall to hit their heads. I don't mean by this that the film is boring, actually it moves at a surprisingly fast clip all throughout, even during the 19th century not-quite-romance-but-more-than-friendship Bruggler has with the baroness, merely that its emphasis is not on action so much as the situation of war itself. The writing (by screenwriter Joseph Dalman, working from the novel by Anton Graf Bossi-Fedrigotti) is quite good and intersperses plenty of wit with the drama, and the acting is very good throughout, with very little of the dewy-eyed sappiness that marks many films from this era. Emotionally the film is tinged with war glorification, or perhaps the glorification of the notion of sacrifice for the homeland, and there is a deliberate emphasis on the fact that Austria's ally-savior in the fight with Italy is Germany (underscoring the idea that the two nations were in fact one, which was a central tenant of Hitler's foreign policy and was achieved two years after it was shot); but as I said above, there are no messages written into this film which are any different really from those which appear in a film like ""Sergeant York"" or any similar British or American war movies of the 30s or early 40s. The values of courage, patriotism, and loyalty to the home fires, which are celebrated in ""Bruggler"" (along with the rustic peasant life) are hardly unique to Nazism, and indeed, the only thing in the movie which struck me as essentially Germanic, other than the amazingly ornate pipes the villagers smoke, are the uniforms of the militiamen, which are distinctly reminiscent of those of the Waffen-SS. All in all, I can recommend ""Bruggler"" simply as a good and satisfying, if unspectacular, piece of 1930s German cinema, as well as a pleasant first experience with Bergfilms generally.",1427673600,6,5108,4.86337543053961
8542442,5,B009KCS8QW,Great movie . I enjoyed it very much. It was very well done for its period. The acting was very good and the scenes were very exciting.,1395532800,3,135,4.037037037037037
8542443,4,B009KCS8QW,"Based on a book by the same title, this movie deals with unit of Tyrolean militia from a small mountain village who are tasked with protecting their homes from the invading Italians. As a Nazi-era film it doesn't come across as overtly propagandistic, and to me at least is more tolerable than much of the drivel that Hollywood produced before and during the Second war. But of course German-speaking people defending their land is so politically incorrect. My (region free) dvd is, I believe, from a different company, which I ordered from Germany - the quality isn't that great, and I can't say if this one has parts added or deleted. Overall, though, it's worth viewing if you want a different perspective on the First war, or are interested in how that war was interpreted during the Third Reich era.",1369958400,4,804,4.75
