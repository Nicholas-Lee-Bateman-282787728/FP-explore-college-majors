4486402,5,B004WD1IXO,"I already own all of these from the same company and they are fantastic. However Hoppy did ""NOT"" start in 1949, he started in 1950 and the 1st season were movies that had been cut down to fit the slot. These proved to be so popular that Boyd went back and started filming new shows. Gene Autry and Roy Rogers also started in 1950. Lone Ranger was the first show out of the gate and these did start in 1949.",1305244800,48,406,4.0875

4486408,5,B004WD1IXO,It was not exactly what I had expected. I had not seen any of the Hopalong Cassidy tv shows since I was a small child over 60 years ago. I had seen some of the movies recently on the Western Channel. I found the tv shows much better than I had expected. I also liked the 10 movies that were included. This product was way better than I had expected. Most certainly worth the price. I had forgot how good the tv series was.,1492300800,,422,4.035714285714286

4486414,5,B004WD1IXO,"Hopalong Cassidy was before the cowboys I remember watching, but I took a chance and happy I am that I did.  I have taken this set to family gatherings and we have enjoyed the series and this actor.  It is written that he would not do an appearance unless it was free for ALL CHILDREN, because he felt that if it cost, many children would never have the same advantage.  This concern for his fans and for the quality of his work comes through in his shows, as well as the feeling that there are good people that try to do what is right, no matter the odds.  Get for your children and for yourself; you won't be disappointed especially if you liked Roy Rogers, Gene Autry and the good feelings they invoked then and still do.",1483228800,4,724,4.262773722627737

4486436,1,B004WD1IXO,"This review is for the Hopalong Cassidy Complete TV series as packaged as shown on the website i.e.  -- on his horse Topper,  with blue sky background. First the positive (based on three buying attempts): This set is superior to others in that 1) it is attractive and 2) the back of each case has the complete listing of all episodes on the two disks within each case (in addition to the names of each episode on the disks themselves)..
However, upon opening the shrink-wrap I found that the six disks are housed in three SUPER ULTRA-THIN (and I mean SUPER-THIN) dvd cases (so they fit nicely into the cardboard sleeve-box. The only problem is that these cases are so thin that 1) in each case disks are not sitting on the hubs in the case -- the hubs are not ""tall"" enough for the disks to click on. 2) All the hubs themselves are broken through the thin case wall so net result is that these are useless cases for the safe storage of the disks.. This is the fault of the manufacturer, which I supposed was trying to save pennies in designing the entire package this way. If the buyer wants to secure the disks he/she is forced to purchase other standard thin dvd cases and transfer the disks to those regular ultra-thin cases where the hubs are such that the disks will snap onto the hubs. OK extra expense, but there is now an additional problem. The three regular ultra-thin cases are a bit too thick to fit into the cardboard sleeve box. Thus, the whole purpose for the sake of collecting, having the entire set as pictured in one box is lost. Perhaps that is why the set is now also sold in an ugly designed thick (1) case) with a flimsy center page to accommodate the six disks in one case. Many sellers are showing this picture but substituting the other boxed set for this one. Bait and switch at work?? .
While the TV show itself deserves a FIVE STAR rating, the product packaging and storage of the set deserves a ZERO (if it were possible to give that rating). The purchaser is stuck -- 1) to replacing all dvd cases at his/her expense, and 2) being unable to keep the set together as a unit. If anyone subsequently wanted to resell this set, they would be unable to do so, because if they used the original SUPER ULTRA THIN cases, NO ONE WOULD BUY IT and send it back to you -- due to the of the broken hub/back of case damage.",1433030400,19,2340,4.328018223234624

4486451,5,B004WD1IXO,Just purchased this a short time ago and I'm very pleased with it!  Haven't had time to watch every episode as yet but what I have seen is excellent!  Given the age of the source material the images are pretty sharp and the audio is very good.  If I were to wish for something it would be closed captioning.  I was born in the early 1950's and wasn't old enough to watch Hopalong's  show first hand.  However I did catch some of the episodes in syndication and loved the ones I saw.  It's a real treat to have all of the episodes in my library now.  This is a great wholesome family show that has a positive message for all.

Yep, bad guys get shot but it's never graphic and always the last resort.

4486477,5,B004WD1IXO,"My 94 year old grandfather loves Hopalong, and this set is a welcome addition to the movie sets we already have. William Boyd was a genius in so many ways, taking the character of Hoppy, who was a rather disreputable character in the original Clarence Mulford stories, and turning him into a paragon of virtue and justice. Boyd also single-handedly invented the concept of character merchandising, at least beyond that of cartoon animals. Except for some essentially cartoonish violence, there are all the reasons to get Hoppy and none to leave him by the wayside.",1377302400,,564,4.947368421052632

.. I was born in 1951..... there was a reluctance on my part to purchase
a product from a period that  can be called the first wave of westerns.
I am so happy to have been proved wrong in this.
Everything about this product is put together lovingly, the film is crisp
and the sound faultless, and I am now a fan of Hopalong Cassidy.
This is different from programs such as Wagon Train or Rawhide,
however there is something about the calm attitude of Hopalong Cassidy that invites viewers
in and leaves one feeling happy.
A figure dressed in black riding a wonderful white horse named Topper, wearing a 10 gallon hat carrying twin 6-guns and as he walks
a jingle is heard from his spurs,not forgetting that interesting necktie.

HOPALONG CASSIDY OPENING & CLOSING THEME LYRICS
""Here he comes, here he comes
There's the trumpets, there's the drums, here he comes.
Hopalong Cassidy, here he comes.

(humming)

There he goes, on his way,
Down the trail the cowboy way.
Hopalong Cassidy, Hopalong Cassidy.

He returns, soon again,
There's no use to say goodbye until then.
Hopalong Cassidy, so long Hopalong"".

Hoppy with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, theses scenes are pure Americana! --- Boyd, with his silver hair, black clothes and white horse (Topper) rode into our lives and we've never been the same since.  Your children and grandchildren will enjoy this clean wholesome entertainment.  Hoppy always wore two silver white handle six shooters, never drank or smoked.  Remember when the good guys always won and the moral to the story was fair-play -- outstanding role model.

Very reasonable and a good value for the price --- For product description and editorial review check this out on the Amazon site above my review.

All the films and television episodes are EXCELLENT: sharp picture, clear audio with tender loving care provided for all the Hoppy fans.

This is everything I expected -- and more!

8445018,3,B004WD1IXO,"I have nothing bad to say about the quality of the movies.  After all, it was a long time ago.
My problem is the marketing.  Nothing is in chronological order.  I have checked quite a few of the series and checked against the movie names. About 10 are nothing more than edited versions of the movies.  I don't mind that so much either.  Too much shoot-em-up and forever long scenes of horses running through the same terrain.",1522972800,,425,4.467532467532467

In one episode Ward Cleaver (Hugh Beaumont) is one of the bad guys he is smoking and cavorting with an unsavory woman and shooting at Hoppy!
