5038963,4,B006Z7Z3PO,We are enjoying watching the first few episodes.  We remember it well in the 60's.  We just do not remember all of the details.  BUT my wife got it yesterday for $5 in the $5 bin at Wal-Mart.  Not sure what that means for the franchise?  I showed her the new movie's preview and she also did not like it.  Hopefully the whole movie is better.,1336176000,,342,4.106060606060606
5038964,5,B006Z7Z3PO,a must have if you are a Barnabas Collins fan..pick this one up ...especially now that Jonathan Frid recently passed away!,1334966400,8,122,4.857142857142857
5038965,5,B006Z7Z3PO,"To coincide with the theatrical release of ""Dark Shadows"" in May, 2012 starring Johnny Depp as Barnabas MPI Video is releasing three titles the month before on April 12th. This ""Best Of"" collection has a running time of about 180 minutes and since the original series ran for thirty minutes each day on ABC I would wager there will be at least six episodes to this set featuring the wonderful Jonathan Frid as the most beloved vampire in pop culture history.

 This single-disc DVD will feature 9 episodes along with brand new introductions.

 No extras have been anounced as of this writing.

 The second collection will be called ""Fan Favorites"" and that too clocks in at about 180 minutes. Obviously these two sets are aimed for people that have a small interest in the ""Dark Shadows"" daytime television franchise as the price is affordable. However, the big news is on April 12th MPI is releasing the entire ""Dark Shadows"" collection called simply ""Dark Shadows-The Complete Collection"" featuring all 1225 episodes and a slew on bonuses so look for that. If your like me, an ardent soap opera fan and a huge lover of this beloved 1960's serial, we will be in Heaven!",1327190400,35,1170,4.767326732673268

5039017,4,B006Z7Z3PO,"This represents a sampler of stories featuring Cousin Barnabas: The original TV tortured Vampire, Jonathan Frid played the part for years in the 60's & 70's... And I'm sorry kids, but the Collins pre-date the Cullens ... Once Barnabas was added to Collinwood he quickly became the most popular character and story arc on the soap and a major shift to supernatural storylines occurred. Series creator Dan Curtis also co-created Kolchak: The Night Stalker series (inspiration for the X-Files). After you finish this teaser DVD, featuring the ""Release of Barnabas"" much like Barnabas' thirst for blood you will crave more or the series, abd there's 1000s more where these come from although the early & later stories less focused on our cursed cousin.  There's  was even an revival of the series with Ben Cross as the Vampire in the 90's.  and recently Tim Burton had Johnny Depp in the role for a more campy take on the part, perhaps even more sympathetic too. But unless you already own or already plan to get the Complete Original Series, this an excellent primer.",1387756800,,1064,4.867403314917127

5039020,5,B006Z7Z3PO,I like this collection of shows. It is fun and gives the highlights of the show. It relates the basics well if you see the newer movie and then watch this DVD.

The storyline is amazing, and it is nice to see a blip every now and again to show that people make mistakes!

5039036,4,B006Z7Z3PO,"This DARK SHADOWS compilation salutes ""The Best of Barnabas"", the character that helped the show climb to the top of the ratings - and cement the show's legendary status.  Until Barnabas arrived in episode #211, DARK SHADOWS was a soap opera mostly concerned with the mysteries surrounding Collinwood governess Victoria Winters (Alexandra Moltke).  Creator Dan Curtis began injecting supernatural elements like ghosts, and the reveal of a prominent character as an immortal Phoenix.  Audiences responded favourably - leading to the decision to introduce Barnabas Collins (played by the masterful Jonathan Frid) - a 175-year-old vampire in search of his lost love.

At once malevolent yet incredibly sympathetic, Barnabas was unlike any other character seen on TV.  What was originally intended as a short stint to boost ratings turned into a 4-year journey for the reluctant vampire, cursed into infinity by the scorned witch Angelique (Lara Parker).

The nine episodes included in this DARK SHADOWS package illustrate the shifting changes in Barnabas' personality (he was cured of his vampirism several times only to be always thwarted by Angelique in one of her many incarnations).  Newer fans will be helped by the introductions of star Lara Parker who gives brief outlines of the plots for each episode.

Episodes:

#221 - Barnabas meets waitress Maggie Evans (Kathryn Leigh Scott) at the Collinsport Inn for the very first time - setting in motion his plan to abduct her and transform her into his long-lost Josette.

#349 - The medical experiments undertaken by Dr Julia Hoffman (Grayson Hall) have gone awry, causing Barnabas to age to his true appearance.

#418 - In 1795-era Collinwood, Josette (Kathryn Leigh Scott) is still drawn to Barnabas, despite the danger threatened by Angelique.

#535 - In the grip of Angelique's ""Dream Curse"", Barnabas, now cured of his vampire affliction, is once again in Angelique's sights.

#703 - Barnabas travels back to Collinwood in the year 1897 in order to solve the mystery of Quentin Collins (David Selby) and his hold on the children there.

#718 - Still in 1897, Barnabas is warned by Angelique to return to his own time while he still can; and Quentin experiments with a voodoo curse.

#915 - With his back against the wall, Barnabas is forced to comply with the wishes of the Leviathans after he learns that they are controlling Josette.

#982 - In Parallel Time, Barnabas is trapped by author Will Loomis (John Karlen) after he discovers that Barnabas is indeed the original vampire and not an ancestor.

#1133 - In 1840-era Collinwood, Angelique has manifested herself as Valerie, Barnabas' supposed wife, in an effort to destroy his romance with Roxanne Drew (Donna Wandrey).",1363046400,7,2732,5.1309255079006775

5039044,3,B006Z7Z3PO,"I stumbled upon Dark Shadows: The Best of Barnabas part of The Greatest Episodes Collection at my local Wal-Mart for under ten dollars. Dark Shadows aired from 1966 to 1971 normally in the late afternoons. At the time of it's peek Dark Shadows had around twenty million viewers, which is an incredible number compared to the low ratings of today's soap operas (Sadly, there are only four on the air.). And it was known for having errors, such as actors forgetting their lines; stagehands walking in the background; microphones where in the frame shot; etc, because of the tight filming schedule demanded by ABC.

There have been dozens of Dark Shadows sets released over the years. The complete series is coming out this summer but at a whopping $599.98 retail price tag. The show has become more popular due to Tim Burton's remake starring Johnny Depp being released on Friday, resulting in MPI Home Video releasing The Best of Barnabas to DVD.

The episodes are:

  Episode 221 - May 2, 1967
  Episode 349 - October 26, 1967
  Episode 418 - January 31, 1968
  Episode 535 - July 12, 1968
  Episode 703 - March 5, 1969
  Episode 718 - March 26, 1969
  Episode 915 - December 29, 1969
  Episode 982 - March 31, 1970
  Episode 1133 - October 29, 1970

Each episode has an optional introduction by Lara Parker, who played Angelique, but the intros for episodes 703 and 718 are missing, instead the intro for 535 is repeated. The resolution on the episodes is not the best, which may have been caused by the cameras they used during production.

Obviously the remake is going to bring some new fans into the Dark Shadow world, which makes this DVD an affordable introduction to the soap opera. Some episode highlights are when Julia's cure backfired aging Barnabas; Barnabas goes back to 1795; Barnabas introduces himself to the Collins family of 1897; and we get a glimpse of the parallel time arch. My favorite out of this DVD is the black-and-white episode 221 where Barnabas introduces himself to Maggie Evans at the Collinsport Inn.

Dark Shadows: The Best of Barnabas is one of two recently released DVDs, and I'm sure there are going to more. I wish MPI would bring out story arches instead of random episodes. Despite a few flaws, the DVD is a great way to introduce Dark Shadows to new fans.",1337644800,21,2297,4.670822942643391

Jonathan Frid brought Barnabus Collins to life, as a tourtured, sympathic soul of which we had empathy for. There is not as yet a specialized dvd that really captures the complete scope of Mr. Frid's range as Barnabus, but this one tries to, it just does not quite get there, but it's worth having.
