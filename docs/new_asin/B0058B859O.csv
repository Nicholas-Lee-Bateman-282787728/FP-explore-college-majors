4598191,2,B0058B859O,"Too many European ""stars"" and few united states stars.  Those of us who remember the eighties can remember american starlets in the nude",1353715200,3,136,4.913043478260869
4598192,5,B0058B859O,"Hi, purchased the easy 80's Voulume 1 and others in this series. Delivers EXACTLY what is promised. DVDs play flawlessly, easy access to jump to each scene with too many chapters to count and includes a handy detailed insert to find your favorites. This series is a great idea for uncovering dozens of rare films and and presenting them in a memorable way.

Loads of bios and information make it entertaining and enducational too. Oh and by the way, the choice of actresses is unbelievable. Hard to NOT love this series, everything all in one really cool package that I assure you will watch many times over.",1343692800,8,608,4.682242990654205
4598193,2,B0058B859O,"After having purchased the Saucy 70's vol. 1 I was super pleased. Out of curiousity I purchased the 80's edition and I am certainly not impressed. There is no dialouge narrative, the scenes are short and cut up, there's quite a few actresses that don't even bare all.",1341619200,,267,4.583333333333333
4598194,5,B0058B859O,"The DVD does a good job of doing what its title says,showing clips of nudity from the actresses of the 80's. The clips are clear and if you have a favorite actress you don't have to search for any of the old films with nudity they were in. The only complaint is for Susan Dey they used the clip from looker instead of the better clip from first love",1330646400,11,349,4.072463768115942
4598195,5,B0058B859O,"Just a great collection of the ones we all love in the past decades. Can't ask for any better. Glad I bought this and other volumes as well. Looking back years from now, they will be priceless.",1414627200,,193,4.243243243243243

4598201,5,B0058B859O,"This is a good collection of nude scenes for the money. I was surprised to see several scenes of Phoebe Cates from 'Paradise' which were controversial at the time because of her age, and yet, Michelle Johnson, barely 18 when she did 'Blame It on Rio', was hardly noticed. Lots of ladies are featured that I never knew did any nude scenes. Including Rachel Ward. I still have my DVD copy of 'Sharky's Machine' (filmed in Atlanta), and Ward never looked better than she did in this movie. I had no idea she had appeared nude in films like 'Night School'.

Another reviewer named 'Joseph Garvey' griped about the lack of 'American starlets' in the nude. I understand his point. There are a lot European girls featured. But speaking for myself, I was thankful for a brief view of some beautiful women I had never heard of. A case in point would be Sonja Martin, a stunning brunette who rose to fame doing the 'Lemon Popsicle' series from Israel. Another would be Carmen Russo, an Italian beauty who I had seen before, but didn't know her name or where she was from. The various factoids and other trivia add to the viewing experience. This was a good purchase and I'll definitely be going for Volume 2!",1361923200,14,1198,4.546296296296297
