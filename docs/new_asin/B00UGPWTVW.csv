8705961,4,B00UGPWTVW,"Coming out of a restaurant a brash, young girl offers a conservative-type guy a ride. He accepts, and she kidnaps him. Hes in for an incredibly wild time. I didn't hold much promise for this film when I started watching it, but as it developed, it turned out to be very entertaining. Its a crime drama, comedy, romance, thriller with nudity, sex, and violence. Worth watching for mindless entertainmentand Griffith is hot.",1491782400,,422,4.875
