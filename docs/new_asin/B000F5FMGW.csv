8117671,5,B000F5FMGW,"I love this workout.  Glenda Twining is a lovely and inspiring as well as encouraging instructor and the workout has really gotten me into shape. There is a technical problem in one section in which only one side of the body is completed, and you have to shut the dvd off and add in the other side on your own.  However I still love this workout as it is short and fantastic--hitting all of the right spots and whipping you into shape.  It looks like it has gone out of print, which is a terrible shame.",1237420800,,503,4.21875
