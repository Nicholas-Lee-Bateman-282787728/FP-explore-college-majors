4494516,5,B004XC7PPO,I seen him in a play way back when now looking at him grow is marvelous. It is a must have funny as hell video.,1323820800,,111,3.48
4494517,3,B004XC7PPO,"he might have had better shows on his tour but I only found this dvd entertaining not big laffs funny. He does well on the air with his skits and characters but he needs a little more seasoning on his stand-up.  One of the better things he does is his impersonation of Steve Harvey which is spot on.  This is good but not great. His bit about opening up his own business, an ass whoopin factory for people who need they ass whooped was good but when on a little to long....",1317772800,6,473,4.130434782608695
4494518,5,B004XC7PPO,"\I've heard Nephew Tommy on the Steve Harvey show many times but did not know that he was a stand-comedian. He was hilarious and I could not stop laughing. He reminds of Steve when he first started doing comedy. His jokes were timely and I found myself telling them to friends. I've watched this dvd three times and it gets funnier and funnier everytime I watch it. I would recommend this dvd to anyone who likes to laugh. Make sure to watch the extra jokes, they are really funny, I was in tears I laughed so hard.",1314144000,2,515,4.319587628865979
4494519,5,B004XC7PPO,"I've been a fan of Nephew Tommy on the Steve Harvey Morning show for awhile. I even saw him host the Essence Music Festival which was off the chain!!! This DVD is so worth the price. He's insightful and witty and a really cool, good looking dude. The morning show doesn't do him justice. Steve should let him run the show!",1312329600,2,322,4.295081967213115
4494520,2,B004XC7PPO,"I bought this DVD to support him since I listen to the Steve Harvey Morning Show. I thought it was going to be funny. His jokes are pretty average. He spend most of the time talking about politics and the Obamas which is like ""Been there, Heard That before"" It was just not funny. I thought he was going to do the gay guy like he does on the radio show. But he didn't. I was really disappointed.",1312156800,12,395,4.076923076923077

4494544,2,B004XC7PPO,"...As long as you don't try to pass it off as something to be proud of.  This guy is kind of a sociopath, or at least plays one in his act.  Which would be fine as long as he didn't act like it was smart thing to be.  If you're going to dedicate yourself to being a cheater, then admit that it's a terrible thing to do the woman you say you care about.  Don't act like, ""oh well that's how I am, everybody should just learn to like it.""  I think he's just a loud guy, with an average amount of talent and good connections.
2 stars.",1380153600,,531,3.8796296296296298
4494545,1,B004XC7PPO,"Absolutely horrible comedy routine. I couldn't even watch it in it's entirety.  He has poor imitation skills and a disgusting taste in fashion.  I was offended by his impression of white people attending his comedy show.  Not every white person speaks like a redneck and has a truck... just as not every black person speaks in slang and is a gang member... not cool at all.  I have seen many funny comedians make fun of all races and this is the most unintelligible act I have seen thus far.... disgusting.... WASTE OF TIME!!!  I think Amazon Prime is wise to discontinue this show in a few weeks! Thank you, Amazon!",1379808000,,616,4.5636363636363635
4494546,5,B004XC7PPO,"very funny me and my wife enjoyed it we had a good evening.

4494547,4,B004XC7PPO,Kept me laughing the entire time! The nephew is so crazy. This standup was more thought provoking than his character on the radio,1378080000,,129,4.6521739130434785
4494548,4,B004XC7PPO,"I was very impressed with Tommy's stand up routine. His persona from the radio show translated very well to the stand up stage, or maybe his stand up skills translate well to the radio. Either way it goes, I really enjoyed watching.",1376352000,,232,4.5476190476190474
4494549,1,B004XC7PPO,Sat through the entire performance and got a few ha-ha's but nothing where you needed to stop the playback in fear of missing the next joke. Don't waste your time,1375315200,,162,4.433333333333334
4494550,4,B004XC7PPO,A few of the bits went on for too long but good overall.  Would watch another one of his shows.,1374105600,,95,3.75

4494552,1,B004XC7PPO,"Matter of fact, I didn't even giggle during this stand-up routine. I understand that his uncle is Steve Harvey, so he should have come much harder than this.",1371772800,,157,4.642857142857143
4494553,5,B004XC7PPO,I love comedy and love to laugh.  Nephew Tommy made me laugh throughout the entire DVD.  I did not know he was so funny.  Thoroughly enjoyed this DVD.,1370563200,,150,4.285714285714286
4494554,3,B004XC7PPO,I think he's funnier on the radio with Steve Harvey. I listen to him in the mornings doing his pranks and they are hilarious.,1369872000,,125,4.25
4494555,5,B004XC7PPO,his skits are hilarious. invite others to see it with you and you will all have a great laugh. great for an evening of fun,1368489600,,122,3.92
4494556,1,B004XC7PPO,"Some folks believe they can get a laugh strictly from presenting a ""funny vibe"" , how they come out on stage, how they move or a general air that they present. This is true but isn't sustainable if you do not have good quality material delivered in good quality fashion. I just think the talent here is limited and you cannot bluff your way to success.",1365465600,,352,4.348484848484849
4494557,1,B004XC7PPO,"This is a different style of comedy. I prefer him on the radio, where he does a great job with his co-jocks!",1365465600,,108,3.9545454545454546
4494558,5,B004XC7PPO,"I enjoyed this DVD. Nephew Tommy is a Damn fool for real. Please get this if you love stand up comedy, if you don't like stand up comedy still get it you will love stand up comedy after watching Nephew Tommy. BELIEVE THAT.....",1364169600,,226,4.27906976744186
4494559,5,B004XC7PPO,HE is just like Steve Harvey so very funny. Should do more stand up. I love his pranks but I rather see him on dvd.,1363737600,,115,3.64
4494560,4,B004XC7PPO,Tommy will grow up to be like Uncle Steve in his own right.  He's funny with a bad boy smile and a lot of charisma.  You go Tommy!,1363046400,,130,3.607142857142857
4494561,3,B004XC7PPO,"I was looking forward to laughing my butt off. But instead my laughter came in spurts!!! The movie had it's moments. I must say, I was kind of disappointed with Neohew Tommy's jokes",1361664000,,181,4.515151515151516
4494562,5,B004XC7PPO,"The material was really funny and relevent. Also, very adult. My only complaint is that it had to buffer a few times.",1360454400,,117,4.363636363636363
4494563,5,B004XC7PPO,"I thought this movie/comedy concert was hilarious!  Simple as that.  Especially the bit about Michelle Obama--Priceless!  It's true that guys may not like the fact that he tells a lot of their cheater secrets... but it's funny.  Don't watch this in front of an insecure girlfriend or wife, is all.",1358294400,,297,4.88
4494564,4,B004XC7PPO,I thought nephew tommy was ok he was funny as ever. I would recommend for someone to see it for themselves.,1357689600,,107,4.142857142857143
4494565,3,B004XC7PPO,This comedy show was not as funny as I thought it would be. I listen to him all the time on the radio and he is great but this was nt the same Nephew Tommy.,1357603200,,156,3.4857142857142858
4494566,1,B004XC7PPO,"I really didn't like this dvd by Nephew Tommy. He stayed on the same joke topic for too long.
i expected to be crying and laughing at the same time. this dvd needs to be sold for 2 dollars cause thats what i would've paid for it if i knew that it was going to be this bad. he is more funny on the radio than on this dvd.",1344988800,,320,3.652173913043478
4494567,2,B004XC7PPO,Too predictable!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wack!!!! He is not that funny and I feel he is better on the radio. I hope he continues to tell jokes when not in person because this dvd was lame.,1335398400,,177,4.393939393939394

4494569,1,B004XC7PPO,"I also bought the DVD out of support & even though I gave it one (1) star it didn't deserve that!!! I expected some of the jokes and personalities he does on the radio but he delivered nothing even close. I almost think there must have been ""cue cards"" telling the audience when to laugh cause this was a waste of my little nickles and dimes, this DVD will definitely go in my ""Trade Box""... People don't waste your money I'll give mines away for FREE!!!",1330300800,6,454,4.290697674418604
