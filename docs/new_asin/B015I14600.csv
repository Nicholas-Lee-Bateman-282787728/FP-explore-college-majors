7441637,5,B015I14600,"317- VIKING WOMEN VS. THE SEA SERPENT  is worth the price of admission for this set, it is by far one of my faves!!! VERY EXCITED about this one!!!!! WOO HOO!!!",1442880000,7,160,4.161290322580645
7441638,5,B015I14600,"This set features two episodes from the Comedy Central era of the show with Joel Hodgson as host and two from the Sci-Fi Channel era featuring Mike Nelson as host.

317- VIKING WOMEN VS. THE SEA SERPENT with short: THE HOME ECONOMICS STORY
The full title of this 1957 black-and-white film directed by Roger Corman is The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent. A group of Viking women set off on a voyage to find their missing men and get captured by the same warriors that hold their men captive. Susan Cabot (Wasp Woman) and Jonathan Haze (It Conquered The World) are amongst the Corman regulars in the cast. The catch phrase ""I'm a Grimald warrior!"" comes from this episode and it's great stuff from beginning to end, including the fun short, The Home Economics Story. Another episode that influenced the writing on the show for years to come.

319- WAR OF THE COLOSSAL BEAST with short: MR. B. NATURAL
This 1958 black-and-white sequel to The Amazing Colossal Man finds Glenn Manning in rural Mexico with brain damage and a disfigured face which almost disguises the fact that there's now a different actor playing the part. It seems that Glenn survived his fall from Hoover Dam in the first picture and is now on a ravenously hungry bestial rampage. His sister is asking authorities to help her find him, which is a good trick since in the first picture we were told that Glenn Manning had no family other than his fiance. The riffing by MST3K is terrifically witty and hilarious just like in the first picture, with the added bonus of the short, Mr. B. Natural, which is a fan favorite and arguably one of the funniest things ever done on the show. The host segment following the short features Crow and Servo debating whether or not Mr. B., who is played by Betty Luster, is a man or a woman. Joel Hodgson moderates the debate and it is outrageously funny. This is a must-see must-own episode!

806- THE UNDEAD
Another 1957 black-and-white Roger Corman film, this one features Alison Hayes (Gunslinger, The Unearthly, Attack Of The 50 Ft. Woman), Bruno VeSota (Daddy-O, Attack Of The Giant Leeches), and Billy Barty (who was in nearly everything from 1927 onward including Willow in 1988). A beautiful woman (Pamela Duncan) is hypnotized and sent back in time to the Middle Ages where she is accused of being a witch. You know a motion picture doesn't have much going for it when a highlight of the film is the gravedigger character, Digger Smolkin, singing bizarre oddly dark songs. It's a pretty good episode from the early days on the Sci-Fi Channel.

808- THE SHE CREATURE
This 1956 black-and-white film is about a hypnotist, Dr. Carlo Lombardi, trying to prove reincarnation by regressing people to past lives. He also wants to bring past incarnations to life in the present, turning this into a B-grade monster film in the process as the eponymous monster claims its victims. It's not exactly a great or exciting film even for one of its type, but it is decent fodder for the MST3K treatment.

Disc #1, 'Viking women vs. sea serpent;
Starts with short 'The home economics story' (color 1951) 21:45 min. Just a Great Short!! I watched it several times. Rating 7
Movie itself (Black & white) with Joel, Kevin & Trace.
Dull movie, dull riffs. - I Smiled 4 times. Rating 1

Disc #2, 'War of the colossal beast' (aka; Colossal man pt. 2)
Starts with short 'Mr. B natural' (color) 17:23 min.
I even watched this a 2nd time - and it just didn't grab me. I want to like it. Rating 3

Disc #3 'The undead' Mike, Kevin, Bill + Maryjo (I never like her) (Black & white)
I only smiled like twice and laughed once. Also - it's a story about 'evil' and I don't even like to kid about that topic.
And putting that aside - it still wasn't funny. Rating 1.5

Disc #4 'The she creature' Mike, Kevin, Bill + Maryjo (Black & white)
And old sci-fi movie about hypnotism. A few funny moments and chuckles.

Overall - other than the 1st short - I just Didn't get into this DVD set. My average rating a 3.5 out of 10. Scott M.",1454544000,3,1459,4.034602076124568

7441658,5,B015I14600,"""It Was a Colossal Teenage Movie Machine: the American International Pictures Story"" -- a bonus feature on the disc with Joel's waffle-obsessed, weirdly blue-tinted version of  ""Viking Women"" -- does a great job of boiling AIP's complicated history down to an entertaining and informative 90-minute documentary. A low budget, youth-oriented production company that grew so successful at copying (and subverting) studio trends for the emerging teen market that they eventually found themselves being copied in turn by the major studios, there wasn't a genre picture that AIP wouldn't try: westerns, horror, sci-fi, rock & roll musicals, spy spoofs, biker dramas, psychedelic freak-outs.

With a cast of characters including Samuel Z. Arkoff, Roger Corman, Vincent Price, Susan Hart, Paul Blaisdell, and James H. Nicholson (the creative head of AIP, and the long-suffering hero of the story this documentary chooses to tell), this behind-the-scenes look at the business of filmmaking -- and a tribute to a lot of movies that have entertained a lot of people, especially MSTies -- is riveting and informative, easily the best bonus feature I've ever seen in one of these box sets. I hadn't known, for instance, that AIP's production process began with the producers choosing a movie's title and commissioning the poster art, and only later assigning a writer to come up with a script; it makes sense from a business perspective (""Know your market and what they want to buy before manufacturing your product"") even as it stands as a brutally clear illustration of the writer's task in Hollywood: doing intellectual grunt work on deadline.

Oh yeah, there are four MST3K episodes in this box set as well, courtesy of the Arkoff Estate. You should watch those, too.",1451692800,,1759,5.208480565371024

7441661,5,B015I14600,"The 34th set is just as much fan as the 1st.  And as usual, only made watchable by the captives on the SOL.

The Saga of the Viking Women And Their Voyage To The Waters Of The Great Sea Serpent.  Whew!  The name is much better than the movie.  What really made this one very nice was the Bonus Feature ""It Was A Colossal Teenage Movie Machine: The A.I.P. Story.""  And the short ""The Home Economics Story"" is one of the funniest ones they have ever done (and they have done a bunch).  This short made the torture of the movie worth it.

War Of The Colossal Beast.  Yes, it is as bad as it sounds.  Again, what made it worthwhile is the short - ""Mr. B. Natural.""  This has to be THE funniest one ever.  How the writers ever get beyond their gag reflexes for a movie like this is beyond my comprehension.  So enjoy this piece of....well, you know; the SOL crew suffered to bring it to us.

The Undead.  The idea was good.  As usual, it was the execution that went horribly wrong.  The SOL crew makes it an enjoyable journey nonetheless.  Roger Corman does his best to make us lose it - and he nearly succeeded - but not quite.

And finally - The She-Creature.  My instinct is to make some jokes about the movie being about my ex, but I won't - although it was very hard not to.  The movie, as with the rest of the ones in this release, has to be seen to be believed.  And the fact that as the final credits roll, you can say ""I made in through another set - bring on XXXV!""  That is after your stomach has settled and you get over that they made a movie named after your ex.",1450310400,2,1571,4.078688524590164

7441664,5,B015I14600,"Volume 34 of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" has a superb selection of movies.  Joel Hodgson hosts ""The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent"" (1957).  That sword and sandal (or spear and thong) epic was directed by the great Roger Corman.  The story is all wet, and the seasick sea serpent makes little more than a cameo in the movie.  Watching little Jonathan Haze (Little Shop Of Horrors) defeat muscular Michael Forest (Apollo in an episode of ""Star Trek""), was like watching a wrestling match with a predetermined winner.  That disc includes the documentary ""It Was A Colossal Teenage Movie Machine: The A.I.P. Story,"" a lengthy, informative look at the legendary American International Pictures movie studio.

""The Amazing Colossal Man"" (1957) was directed by Bert I. Gordon (Mr. BIG), and starred Glen Langan as Lt. Col. Glenn Manning.  Joel hosted that movie in MST3K's third season.  It was released on VHS video by Rhino Entertainment in 1996.  Unfortunately, because of copyright problems, the MST3K version of that movie has never been officially released on DVD.  Fortunately, I still own the video and a working VCR, and was able to watch that before I watched its sequel, ""War of the Colossal Beast"" (1958).  That film was also directed by Bert I. Gordon (Mr. BIG), but starred Dean Parkin as Lt. Col. Glenn Manning.  Since the gigantic man has a disfigured face and only grunts and groans, the difference is negligible.  The riffing by Joel and the 'bots is terrific, but what really makes this disc a classic is the inclusion of the short subject, ""Mr. B. Natural"" (1956), which precedes the movie.  Mr. B Natural is an androgynous pixie, played by a woman, who helps a young boy master his instrument.  As Joel says, ""Mr. B, you're hot!""  It's the funniest and most famous of all the MST3K shorts.

Mike Nelson hosts ""The Undead"" (1957), which was directed by Roger Corman.  In that movie, the beautiful Pamela Duncan (Diana Love/Helene) regresses through hypnosis back to a past life in the Middle Ages, where she is about to be beheaded as a witch.  Most of this strange film takes place in that time period, with the characters speaking pseudo-Shakespearian drivel.  The supporting cast features the gorgeous Allison Hayes as the witchy woman Livia, Mel Welles as the mad gravedigger Smolkin, and Billy Barty as the impish Imp.  That movie, as well as the following film, were somewhat inspired by amateur hypnotist Morey Bernstein's book, ""The Search For Bridey Murphy.""

Mike also hosts the final film in this volume, ""The She Creature"" (1956).  In that movie, Chester Morris (Dr. Carlo Lombardi) regresses the beautiful Marla English (Andrea Talbott/Elizabeth Wetherby) through hypnosis, back to a past life in England over 300 years ago.  The slimy Dr. Lombardi continues to regress her to a past life as a prehistoric humanoid type of sea creature, complete with crustaceous cleavage.  He uses the physical manifestation of that creature to commit vicious murders.  Lance Fuller plays the skeptical Dr. Ted Erickson, the moral counterpart to the villainous Dr. Lombardi. Lance's wooden acting provides humorous fodder for a host segment with Mike and the 'bots.  I hope volume 35 of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" is as great as this volume!",1449964800,11,3309,4.969090909090909

7441666,5,B015I14600,"I actually own this set, and have viewed the experiments and the extras.

Bottom line:  this set is worth the price of admission alone for experiment 806 - ""The Undead"" and 319 - ""War Of The Colossal Beast.""  I'd advise picking this one up (and maybe an extra) as who knows how Roger Corman might feel about his work appearing on MST3K, and these DVD sets have a way of getting VERY scarce after their release.

""Colossal Beast"" has what is perhaps MST3K's signature short, ""Mr. B. Natural,"" an unintentionally disturbing, androgynous take on the spirit of music.

""Viking Women"" is a classic, run-of-the-mill season 3 Joel-hosted Italian sword-and-sandals flick with lots to recommend it, but in and of itself not particularly memorable.

""She Creature"" is another Roger Corman-directed monster flick from the very underrated Sci Fi season - an era totally underrepresented in MST3K's DVD renaissance.

The extras are typical, but there is a feature-length documentary about A.I.P., and some modern introductions by TV's Frank himself, Frank Conniff.
