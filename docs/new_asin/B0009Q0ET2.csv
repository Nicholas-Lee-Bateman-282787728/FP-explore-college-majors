No action, little comedy, plenty love scene sofcourse...wlel just picture a spansh show from TV in a movie, samething.",1258588800,,563,4.081081081081081

8065291,4,B0009Q0ET2,"My wife is originally from Ecuador. So I am always on the lookout for South American movies we can enjoy together. ""Bano de Damas"" is a Peruvian film that revolves around a large cast of characters that meet and interact in the bathroom of a city bar.

Some of main female character's are Mrs Lopez (a politican's wife), Chloe Cruz (a famous singer), Antonia (the bathroom attendant), two lesbian lovers and a drunk woman. The only significant male characters are Gaviota (a gay guy who longs to get a sex change operation) and Congressman Lopez (a violent, hypocritical scumbag who is cheating on his wife).

The previous reviewer has it wrong when he insinuiates this is a sexy movie intended for a male audience. In fact, this is a movie more likely to appeal to women. As it shows the perspective of a variety of different Latinas on issues such as gender roles, abortion, pregnancy, relationships and sex.

The ""bad guy"" of the movie is the lying, unfaithful Congressman Lopez who ends up finally getting what he deserves at the end of the film. This movie is from the male director Micheal Katz. But the female characters and the gay guy are the heroes as they encounter the sexism, violence and homophobia of ""macho"" Latin society.",1185321600,4,1238,4.722222222222222

I don't speak Spanish, but I was a big fan of ""Viviana"" (Viviana Gibelli's little comedy type show she had for a while) for ""obvious"" reasons, so I went for this movie. Not bad at all. hehe (And yes, English subtitles are available on this one.)",1151452800,,269,4.4
