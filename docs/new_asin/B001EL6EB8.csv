8298555,5,B001EL6EB8,"Relateable characters, progressive and complete story, action, drama, and a good dose of humor really makes this anime for me. A bonus for a science fiction fan like me, it's science is rock hard. There's no phlebotinum or rule bending to be seen, and they even get HOW THINGS GO WRONG, RIGHT!!!",1489968000,,295,4.6923076923076925
8298556,5,B001EL6EB8,"Some Sci-fi, some fan service (mild), drama and action. Fun with a solid story line. Don't miss it.",1461628800,,99,4.555555555555555
8298557,5,B001EL6EB8,Great show and pretty decent CGI.  Interesting drama with the American shuttle crew and the girls at the end.  Main character has crazy strange father and wierd mother.,1398297600,,168,4.964285714285714
8298558,4,B001EL6EB8,"Made with assistance from the Japanese space agency, and based on the novels of Housuke Nojiri (found here:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocket-Girls/dp/1421536420/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocket Girls</a>),  the series' scifi credentials are about as solid as they come, no matter what the box art suggests.

Which is great, but for me the acid test of any show is 'Is it fun to watch?'  In this case, a definite yes.  I'll leave in depth character reviews to sites better suited for it, but all three girls are likable in their own ways, and their interactions are well handled.  The supporting characters are less well established, but still convincing.  None feel redundant or out of place.  The animation is CGI heavy with respect to the rockets and support equipment, but otherwise smooth and easy on the eyes.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the only real disappointment is the lack of a dub track, though since I prefer subtitles anyway it was a moot point for me.

All in all, a nice series for scifi fans and general viewing alike.",1286236800,,1087,5.273255813953488
8298559,1,B001EL6EB8,"What were they thinking?

Yes, I do like the series as sci fi comedy but come on, recruiting a high school girl in search of her long lost father to be an astronaut only because she'll fit inside the capsule and is of light enough to allow the rocket that doesn't blow up all the time to launch her into orbit? Through in some vodoo magic and what you get is this mess. Leave your analytical realistic mind at the door and have a giggle. But truly good sci fi? Don't think so. I'm amazed a company actually licensed this for US distribution. If it were priced like Kashimashi, OK, but it simply isn't worth the MSRP. Soon to arrive in the clearance bin. '-)

What were they thinking?",1250812800,,683,4.286821705426356
8298560,5,B001EL6EB8,"Saw the first few episodes of this in Yokohoma in Aug. '07--Nippon2007, world science fiction convention.  Held off buying acc/ not complete and not all subtitled.  Glad it is finally in US--12 episodes, Japanese dialog, English subtitles and some Romaji helps one follow dialog and pretend to be studying Japanese while relaxing.

  A Japanese manned space program in the Solomon Islands suddenly needs to recruit petite astronauts.  A young woman finds her half sister, rockets launch, some explode,  People launch into orbit--do they all make it back home?

  Loved these young ladies, how they interact and develop.  Liked the storyline, minimal violence and gunplay.  Space and tech otaku will get a kick out of the rockets and craft.  Anime-jin don't let go of good storylines.  What will the sequel look like?",1236124800,3,816,5.129770992366412
8298561,5,B001EL6EB8,"""Rocket Girl"" is one of the best SF anime describing REAL space development in near future. This anime is based on the novel ""Rocket girl"" and ""Tenshi ha kekka all-right (The result of the angels is all right),"" written in Housuke Nojiri, who is one of the best SF author in new generation in Japan. Mr. Nojiri actually calculate the opportunity of very small and light-weited astronaughts, and he hit upon the good idea to fly high school girls in space -- In the story, Rocket girl. Mr. Nojiri's very unique idea is spreaded out now; for example, his SKIN-TIGHT space suit is examined seriously in several space agency, he also foretell the tragic Space Shuttle accident (not shown in the anime series,) and NASA now develop new rocket-type vehicle other than new space shuttle.
  The fidelity of animation series for the original story is very high, and the character design is pretty good. I really recommend this animation to the serious SF fan and ANIME fan, of course.",1233360000,3,975,4.763313609467455
