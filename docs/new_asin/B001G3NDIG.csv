3595152,4,B001G3NDIG,"I love this show, the only thing that could make having it on prime better is closed captioning.  Watching Jamie and Adam interact is always fun.  Kari, Tori, and Grant are always entertaining.",1360713600,,193,4.818181818181818
3595153,4,B001G3NDIG,"Mythbusters is a great series and will always get a 5 star rating in any of my reviews and Anubis had extremely fast shiping to make any purchase from him worth it.

unforionatly I had to knock off one star in my rating becouse of Anubis's labling mistake on his product. it is labled on both the Amizon web site and the oder slip of purchase that it is the COMPLETE Season 3 of Mythbusters that is suppose to have 26 episodes on six discs. the one i recived is simply the Season 3 with 15 episodes on three discs.

but other then that i have no complaints about my purchase when comparing it to the other Mythbusters seasons out there and Anubis's speedy shipping made it money well spent.",1356307200,,690,4.3
3595154,5,B001G3NDIG,"Adam and Jamie, with build crew members, Tory, Kari, Scottie, and Christine, decide to test the myth you could clean out the inside of a cement truck using a stick of dynamite.  They run into a problem when they realize their cement truck was accidentally filled 2/3 full rather than the light coating they had asked for.  With the help of FBI, county sheriff, and a whole host of other badges, they blow up the cement truck so there is virtually nothing left.  Excellent explosion!",1349568000,3,482,4.647058823529412
3595155,5,B001G3NDIG,The video was perfect for what I needed. I am a teacher and my students watched the episode picking out the steps to the Scientific Method.,1348963200,,139,4.384615384615385
3595156,5,B001G3NDIG,"I've been a science nut most of my life. To this day, 20 years after college, I still pop by the library, and read ""Scientific American"" every month; read about 30 pop science books per year; and watch PBS and Annenberg Media/ learner.com science specials to keep current with developments in modern physics and biology.

But, I have to say, that ""Mythbusters"" is the best TV show, and best illustration of science thinking, of the lot. ""Mythbusters"" makes it very clear that ""Big 'S'"" Science is not about learning the laws of motion, electricity, genetics, etc. by rote. Science is about thinking clearly about how things work.

Every week, Jamie, Adam and crew lead viewers through some amazingly simple, but powerful illustrations of the scientific method at work. And they do it in an off-handed way. In their hands, the scientific method looks like this...
1) Be curious, and look at the world with a sense of wonder.
2) When something catches your eye, ask yourself, ""How does that work?"" And, finally,
3) Design, make and execute an experiment to test if your hunch is right or wrong.

The last point has nothing to do with the scientific method. But it has everything to do with the geeky pleasure I get watching this show...
4) If the experiment doesn't work, think of a cool way to destroy something with it. Blow it up. Or make a catapult. Just make a big boom.

No, folks: This is not your grandmother's dull PBS special.

I mean, you get to see Jamie and Adam, two grown men in their 40's, wearing adult diapers, searching for ""the brown note"". Or watching Scottie, Carey and Tory--all of who seem like great hearted, and very kind people--shouting insults to pea plants.

A lot of fun for the nerd. And, it brings science out of its lofty tower, and returns it where it belongs: To regular Joe's and Jo's. Testing a hunch in their garage.",1337731200,4,1853,4.634146341463414
3595157,5,B001G3NDIG,My grandson is addicted to Mythbusters.  We were constantly recording them and filling up the storage space on the DVR.  Now the shows are available whenever he wants to watch them,1328400000,,180,4.774193548387097
3595158,5,B001G3NDIG,The Mythbusters are Jami and Adam are Motion Picture special effects men who put myths to the test. For Family entertaiment you can't beat them. If you loved education in you entertaiment go with the mythbusters.,1318118400,,212,4.916666666666667

3595187,5,B001G3NDIG,"Depressed about season 19 being the last one. My entire adult life has had one constant thing - the Mythbusters. I even visited M5 once. You could call me a super fan. You can learn a lot form them about life and science.  They have invaded every aspect of the American culture and I am sad to see them go. I watched there show so many times my son has to watch it every time before he goes to bed. Thanks to them my son loves science and math.  It is fun to watch them stumble through things as they learn - you learn with them, it is like a voyage of discovery.  What they have achieved with this show has expanded human knowledge for the better. This show will be sadly missed, it was not just fun to watch be you learned a lot and some of of there experiments save the life's. Before the Mythbusters the only good show to watch about science was Bill Nye the Science Guy and you didn't learn a lot from him but you sure did learn a lot from the Mythbusters. I wish that the Discovery Channel wood keep the show going for another 19 seasons. ""Thank you Jamie Adams Tory grant and kari. It was fun to watch you guys learn can achieve new things in your lives I wish you well and anything you do for the rest your lives thank you.""",1451001600,,1232,4.082644628099174

3595192,4,B001G3NDIG,"Mythbusters is pretty shallow -- 99% entertainment and 1% science.  I'd like to see them add more science content.

But in a society where most people are scientifically illiterate and proud of it, even ""lite science"" is better than no science.  I've seen almost every episode from almost every season, and I still look forward to more.",1433721600,,336,4.859649122807017
3595193,4,B001G3NDIG,"I am a high school science teacher and I love to show Mythbusters to support my students in understanding the concepts. This episode was entertaining and encouraged my students to ask great questions that pushed the topic to a new level. I only showed the breaking glass portion of the episode, as it was the only part that applied to my topic (sound waves) and I did not find the other myths in this episode particularly interesting.",1432944000,,434,4.64935064935065

3595197,1,B001G3NDIG,"This review really applies to the ability to transfer the Mythbusters episode from Amazon to the Amazon Prime app on my Ipad.  Although the instructions seem simple, my Ipad just refuses to accept the episode which I dutifully purchased at the Amazon site (a purchase evidenced by this review).  Clearly there is a pressing need to improve e-communication between Amazon (the largest source of video content) and the Ipad universe (the best regarded hardware for viewing video content).  I suspect the transfer failure arises in the titanic battle between Apple and Amazon, two IT giants locked in combat who have no concern for the mere mortals they may step on in the process.  A pox on both your houses!",1412899200,,706,4.907563025210084

3595199,5,B001G3NDIG,"This season shows the maturation and refinement of the program. They are getting the hang of the show and the interaction with Tory and Kari (and Scottie, who shortly leaves the series) is developing.

The only disappointment is with Amazon. These older episodes used to be available for live stream with Amazon Prime. At the time Amazon announced their price increase, they also eliminated the ability to stream the older Mythbusters episodes with the Prime subscription. It is disappointing that they would increase price and reduce service at the same time.",1395705600,4,560,5.153846153846154

3595254,5,B001G3NDIG,"By Season 3, the Mythbusters found their scientific approach and the style they wanted to use to bust myths, and they produced some really great episodes. Grant Imahara joins the cast in this collection, and I do think his presence ups their game.

I'm a big fan of all the Mythbusters; I've seen every episode they've produced. I didn't get much science in my education, and I've certainly learned a lot from Adam, Jamie, Grant, Tory, and Kari. I love to laugh while I learn. Enjoy!",1388275200,,483,4.616279069767442

They love the way the two scientist interact, and they particularly enjoy the various explosions. ;-)  The one complaint is the somewhat salty language sometimes used in this season.
