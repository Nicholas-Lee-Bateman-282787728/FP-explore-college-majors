Thymiane (Louise Brooks) not aware of the relationship her father had with another of his housekeepers Elisabeth (Sybille Schmitz); she is confused as to why the housekeeper had to leave and ultimately why the housekeeper committed suicide. The pharmacist Meinert (Fritz Rasp) downstairs is more than willing to show her what happens when one gets too friendly and does so when Thymiane faints.

This results in an offspring. The father pays the pharmacist's debt in exchange for making an honest woman of Thymiane. However she reneges and holds out for love; naturally this is unacceptable so she and her diary are sent off to a correctional institute for lost girls. Her offspring is handed over to a midwife.

Will her father come to his senses or is he falling pray to his latest housekeeper Meta (Franziska Kinz?)
Will she break out of the oppressive institute or just learn evil ways?
Will her old friend Count Nicolas Osdorff (Andr Roanne) come to her rescue?
Or will he have problems of his own when he is out cast?

We find our selves sitting on the edge of our seats, kibitzing even if we saw the movie before.

We are reminded that with a little more love no one on this earth has to be lost.",1497484800,,1335,4.737068965517241
8706141,5,B00UGPRLR4,"This is a black and white silent film featuring Louise Brooks in the title role.  It does get to be kind of long after a while, but, it is actually a very serious movie with a strong message.  While probably more autobiographical than the film makers realized, as Louise Brooks in real life was sexually abused at a young age, the story centers around a well to do girl who has just finished her confirmation.  (In Germany that is an important coming of age milestone, to officially join the Church.)  After her maid gets fired (probably due to rejecting the advances of her father), Louise Brooks' character meets the Pharmacist downstairs to find out what happenned.  Unfortunately, she finds out all too well what happenned.  As the pharmacist drugs her and rapes her and she ends up having a baby.  In the meantime, her father has taken up with the new housekeeper who is more manipulative than the previous one and she arranges to have Louise Brooks' character's baby sold (one gathers to be killed) to a midwife and places Louise Brooks' character in a reformatory school.  The school is overly strict and the girl is puzzled as to why she is there.  She ends up escaping with the aid of a friend who is also down and out, despite his high birth, and through a series of circumstances ends up working in a high class brothel.  Thankfully, there is a happy ending to the movie.  And what impresses one the most throughout the film is how adept Louise Brooks is at conveying likeability and innocence (through no fault of her own, but she was anything but, in real life) and a waif like helplessness. Her eyes draw one in to the character and her looks, even though not as eye catching as some of the later Golden Age Hollywood stars, really stand out as a cut above.  One really feels drawn to her as a friend and a person.  And it is interesting how the plot of the film so closely mirrors her own life, with the impacting message being how terribly difficult it is for the young women to be sexually taken advantage of.  In a way, even though from 1929, the plot and message of the movie feels decidedly modern at times.",1459641600,,2127,4.490909090909091
