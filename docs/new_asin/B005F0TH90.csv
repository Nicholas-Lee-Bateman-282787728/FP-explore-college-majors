4670244,2,B005F0TH90,"There were 2 disc ""2""s  and no disc 1. Ruined a Chritmas present.  Called and got no help. No wonder it was available only on this website.",1327017600,2,139,4.111111111111111
4670245,1,B005F0TH90,I would not recommend this to anyone. It was a great idea for my dad as a Christmas present only to find that it was 2 discs of the same thing. So now I have to find a set with disc the correct discs in it!!,1325462400,5,207,3.5217391304347827
4670246,1,B005F0TH90,"I ordered this for my dad for Christmas as it is his favorite show and what a great price it was!  I ordered it in plenty of time to get here by Christmas they sent me an email that it has shipped and was expected by christmas eve.  To my disappointment it did not make it and then today, 19 days later, I get an email stating it was returned because they could not deliver it to my address which by the way is in the same exact order in which I placed 13 other items, all which made it no problem.  Reading the other reviews I am kind of glad I did not get it because I do not want two of the same disc I will be ordering him something else.",1325116800,5,642,3.81203007518797
4670247,3,B005F0TH90,"I was very excited to get this video and share one of my favorite shows with my friends and family but was very dissapointed to find out that there were two of the same discs inside! Both of them were disc number two! This is very frustrating seeing that I spent money on this, that could have gone to something that was packaged correctly!",1324857600,5,340,4.328125
4670248,1,B005F0TH90,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend, and couldn't wait for him to see it.  We opened it up right away, only to find that there were two of the same discs inside.  Both disc two.  There appears to be no way to get a replacement for the set... the choice I would like to make.

I certainly will not purchase another one seeing that there were two other customers with the same issue.

Silly me for not reading the reviews before ordering.",1324771200,10,447,4.151162790697675
4670249,1,B005F0TH90,"I was really looking forward to watching this, however the product arrived with two copies of Disc 2, instead of Disc 1 and Disc 2.",1324252800,10,131,4.28
4670250,5,B005F0TH90,"This is a really cool series for people who love aviation, nature and nice people :)
The local airline is a small family business flying local people to remote areas in sometimes very difficult conditions. But it is real a life story, mainly like a documentary but with interesting people and action. You will have some insight how the people in Alaska live and the fantastic nature combined with partly rough meteorological conditions. I definitively highly recommend it. The video quality is good.
What annoyed me however was that I had a box with two times disk 2 in it instead disk 1 and disk 2 and Amazon doesn't leave me no other choice than to send it back to get a refund and pay a shipping supplement of 15$! The DVD's are worth even this surplus but I find it not to be a costumer friendly attitude.",1324166400,7,809,4.472972972972973
4670251,5,B005F0TH90,"The emphasis is on life in Northern Alaska.  This is a reagon so remote that the only way in or out is on an airplane.  The series follows the lives of an Aviation family, the Twetos based out of Unakleet, a small town of not more than 700 people.  The series follows the matriarch, Jim (COO and President of Era Alaska), Ferno (Wife and Unakleet station manager) and their Daughter Ariel.
The series shows what life is like in the 49th state, where you have to hunt for your meat or it comes from the sea.  There are also different traditions with the locals.  The series shows the remoteness and the beauty of the state  and the flying footage is fantastic.  You also get a look into life with the Twetos and you meet some of the people that they transports.  The series will also showcase some of the other pilots that work for the company.
A well done series, it well worth anybody's addition to their video library.  A wonderful series for Aviation fans and those who love the 49th state.",1322092800,,993,4.412087912087912
4670252,5,B005F0TH90,"Good series, leaves you wanting to move to Alaska!",1404259200,,50,4.666666666666667
4670253,5,B005F0TH90,"Interesting and captivating show about a family run airline in Alaska. The ""Tweetos"" are a fun family to get to know. They go through all the same daily dramas the rest of us do, except they have to deal with extreme changes in the weather and remote locations. We travel to Alaska quite often, so maybe it's more interesting to us, but I think everyone will enjoy this show if they give it a chance. Keep hoping the powers that be will put out the final season on dvd...",1390262400,,471,4.303370786516854
4670254,5,B005F0TH90,"I thought ""Deadliest Catch"" was a dangerous and exciting reality show, but ""Flying Wild Alaska"" blew me away.  Not only do you have the danger of Mother Earth to contend with on a daily basis, but the folks of Alaska depend on their livelihood from the ERA airline.  Simply getting from small village to small village can be treacherous with weather like Alaska being unforgiving (ask the staff and crew of ""Deadliest Catch!"")

The big seller for me wasn't simply that the stories were human, real and moving, but the scenery is spectacular.  I never had any idea how differently Alaska looks or how the people truly live.  The Tweto family is the star of this show along with their pilots and the amazing airplanes.  This is really roughing it.  Alaskans depends on groceries, medicine, transportation of the sick, dangerous chemicals (this one for a water plant) and anything you can think of that has to do with daily living.

The episode on a teen suicide was heartbreaking along with how an Alaskan family travels from all over to attend the funeral.  The suicide rate is high up there.  Forced landings on ridges and in rivers are particularly harrowing. Heavy ice forming on the wings and treacherous winds make for knuckle rides and these plots let you know that although they have flown for years, each flight is not to be taken for granted.  The stories are real and the people are intelligent, serious and humorous.  It's not the life for many, but it's a fun ride.  Era Alaska is the lifeline for the isolated rural inhabitants.",1370908800,,1540,4.722846441947565
4670255,5,B005F0TH90,"I really enjoyed this DVD set - the show is exactly what I thought it would be.  It has really reignited my love of general aviation.

I was a little worried when I first ordered it because some of the other reviews said that they did not receive all of the episodes with their purchase.  Mine arrived with both discs and all of the episodes.",1370217600,,342,4.230769230769231
4670256,4,B005F0TH90,"bought this for my father in law, he likes planes allot and used to be a pilot. He appreciated this movie quite a bit.",1356739200,,118,3.9583333333333335
4670257,5,B005F0TH90,"i suspect the producers were looking for a high altitude alternative to the  Alaskan reality show DEADLIEST CATCH - when they happened upon Ariel Tweto on the crazy contest show WIPEOUT - and learned of her family's bush Alaska airline - and realized she had accumulated a following that might tune into this cable reality show - who otherwise might not have

but rather than blind the viewer to the real purpose of the show - which is to record the tension filled lives of modern Alaskan bush pilots - she's placed almost in the background - but not enuf to dim her bubbly personality - or disappoint her fans

in other reality series - i've often felt suspicious about how much preplanning or scripting was done - in this show - there were such moments - such as the Diabetes Polar flight - and the pro skateboarders visit - but - usually - the events feel spontaneous

this show is fast paced and fascinating - with gorgeous airborne scenery of landscapes that could quickly engulf the careless pilot and his unlucky passengers - and plenty of the not so gorgeous overcast and fog shrouded distances which is more typical of Alaska

if you've dreamed of being a good enuf pilot to fly the bush - here's a health dose of reality - with plenty of front seat footage - the only risk is that you might actually be tempted to challenge those ever changing Alaskan skies",1349136000,,1367,4.518218623481781

4670259,5,B005F0TH90,"I hesitated a bit to order this 2 DVD set since there were a number of reviews saying they had received 2 DVDs that were identical. Looks like the problem has been resolved, since I received 2 DVDs with 5 different programs on each. So 10 episodes in all. I have just started watching them, but wanted to list that I had received 2 distinctly different DVDs...I'm glad to
report...Update.
  I have now watched the 5 programs on the 1st DVD. Great! Just started watching the 2nd DVD. Thoroughly enjoyable programs in my view. Held my attention the whole time. Well done!",1335571200,8,569,4.568627450980392

4670261,5,B005F0TH90,"My favorite series. It's so much fun and interesting to follow Era Alaska and the Twetos on their adventures. You get to see the amazing landscapes and nature of Alaska!

I've read that they've made the mistake of selling 2 copies of disc two, but that's NO reason to give this amazing series low ratings.",1328832000,2,305,4.545454545454546

8469419,1,B005F0TH90,"I was expecting flying footage on remote areas of Alaska. However, this DVD is another dimwitted realty TV show about this guy day-to-day operations from his little office in an hangar in Alaska.
