The 'bikers' are riding brand new trail/enduro motorcycles with all the flashy chrome. (before monoshocks)
Kinda liked the nostalgia there.
John Carradine and 2 Mitchum boys.
The guy playing bigfoot was huge.",1514678400,,253,5.684210526315789
7899036,1,630598820X,"If you want to watch a movie that looks like it was written, produced, and directed by a bunch of short bus riding third graders on a budget of less than $20 then this is your movie. This movie re-defines the word ""hokey."" It sucks to a level that sucking has never reached before. In fact, no black hole anywhere in the universe has ever sucked this much. The dialog is amazingly bad, the music, the acting, the storyline, and every other aspect of the movie is terrible. I  watched the entire thing simply because I wanted to write a fair review, and because I was amazed that anything that sucks this bad ever made it beyond a trash can. If you ever want to torture someone for information and you don't have a waterboard, just force them to watch this movie. They will be spilling the beans within 20 minutes. Other than that it's a great movie.",1514332800,2,849,4.3734177215189876
7899037,5,630598820X,"When pilot Joi Landis (Joi Lansing- HILLBILLYS IN A HAUNTED HOUSE) has engine trouble, she is forced to parachute into the deep woods. Of course, she's landed in BIGFOOT (1970) country! She's quickly abducted by the creature. Simultaneously, a group of bikers has arrived, looking for a rustic place to party. Meanwhile, junk dealer Jasper B. Hawks (John Carradine- HORROR OF THE BLOOD MONSTERS) and his associate, Elmer Briggs (John Mitchum) attempt to sell their wares. Oh dear! A bikini-clad biker gal is nabbed by the beast, after she and her boyfriend disturb a yeti burial mound! The rest of the bikers carry on w/ their woodland bash. Can Jasper, Elmer, and the bikers rescue the women, before the hairy horror does the unthinkable? Yep, there's a whole tribe of Bigfoots -Bigfeet?- and they're looking for love! This movie has it all: Sex-starved Sasquatches! Bikers, including one called Dum Dum! A Bigfoot vs. bear battle! Ms. Lansing running around in that awesome outfit! A forest ranger played by intergalactic omni-star, Doodles Weaver! And oh, so much more! Why, the Bigfoot costumes alone are worth any price to view this divine spectacle! Toss in some twang-y music -yes, there are bongo drums!- and you've struck schlock uranium!... EXTRA POINTS- If you can count how many times Ms. Lansing screams her beautiful head off!...",1505001600,4,1343,5.054054054054054
7899038,2,630598820X,"Released in 1970, ""Bigfoot"" was one of the first quasi-horror films devoted to the legendary beast-man, if not THE first. It relays the story of a couple of girls kidnapped by some bigfoot creatures and the mixed posse of country police & bikers who seek to find them.

Unfortunately, this is Grade C filmmaking all the way. For instance, the opening credits don't appear until almost the 10-minute mark. Most the scenes leading up to this are overlong time-wasters, like Joi Lansing walking up to her small plane and entering. Totally pointless! I guess they had to pad this turkey somehow, which is only 83 minutes long as it is. Also, most of the ""acting"" is laughable, and I mean that literally.

For me, the film's worthwhile for three reasons only: (1.) The gorgeous Judy Jordan in a bikini, mostly tied up to a tree (also check her out in 1973's underrated Western ""The Gatling Gun""); (2.) the cool hippie-era score; and (3.) the nostalgic badness of it all, which is sort of entertaining.

The movie was shot at Big Bear Lake and San Bernardino National Forest.
