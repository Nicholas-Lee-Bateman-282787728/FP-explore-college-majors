8600415,5,B004XC5LLE,FIRST of all I have to admit a think Rodney Perry is one of the funniest comedian  I have ever had the privilege  of hearing . So when I saw a review copy of  this DVD I was not too surprised of how well produced and funny it was .  Small Fire is a beast  she has a different brand of humor that keeps  you laughing loudly also AJ Jamal  Caleto  were equally as funny and  its all family friendly .( my wife liked that part)  With all that going on in the world  finding a few minutes to look at the world through the eyes o four of the funniest comedians was a vacation that ended much too soon  Oh well it was funny while it lasted great series looking for more from this group  with such a stellar line up thumbs way uppppp,1306108800,,726,3.924137931034483
