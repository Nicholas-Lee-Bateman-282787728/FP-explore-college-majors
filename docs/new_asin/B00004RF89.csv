1342608,4,B00004RF89,"An Divorce Father (Rick Morains), who is a Professional Writer and Novelist has come to have back to his Child-Hood home for Teaching. But when he meets again his Much-Feared Childhood Bully (Tom Arnold), everything in the Past between Them are Back in a Whole New Way.
Directed by Steve Miner (House, Halloween:H20, Lake Placid) and Written by Mark Steven Johnson (Daredevil) made a clever, often Misfired Satire of his Earlier Written Film-Grumpy Old Men. Morains and Arnold are Big Time Fun in this Underrated Comedy, even when the movie turns a Comedic Thriller at the last Third of the flick. This film was a Flop in Theaters but It did better on Video. Grade:B+.",1018828800,2,668,4.817391304347826

1342622,5,B00004RF89,"I don't know what it is about these 90's movies but I love them! Big Bully is entertaining and demonstrates how bullying is not just a ""kid"" thing, it can follow us into adulthood. My kids loved it then and were just as excited to see it on the DVD shelf at home now.",1413331200,,267,3.962962962962963

1342641,4,B00004RF89,"It had been a long time since I watched this movie, and I finally got to refresh my memory. I loved this movie ever since I was a kid, and it's still funny. Moranis and Arnold were perfect together. When David Leary was a kid, he was constantly bullied by Ross Bigger (Fang) When David and his family moves away, he tells the police that Ross stole a moon rock. Years later, David and his son return to town and David becomes the new creative writing teacher. He finds out that Ross is also a teacher at the same school and continues to bully him again. David soon realizes that he must stop running and face his demon once and for all. I highly recommend BIG BULLY!!!",1273708800,,668,4.267716535433071
1342642,4,B00004RF89,"I found this a cute little movie. Novelist David and his son move back to the small Minnesota town where David grew up in the 70's. He's been invited to teach a creative writing class at his old school.

At first his former tormentor Ross is just a loser shop teacher with an uncooperative wife, and five sons living in a trailer home while David is respected and well-received by his former peers. But when Ross realizes that his former victim is the kid who was responsible for landing him in a Rochester reform school, he becomes a born-again Bully, and the chase is on.

There's an ironic twist where David's son Ben starts to bully Ross's own son. Eventually things come to a head, with a nightmarish chase through the school building during a nighttime thunder and rainstorm, and David escapes Ross's clutches but fears the bully's been killed, but things work out in the end, if a bit unevenly.

Jeffrey Tambor, Don Knotts, and Carol Kane round out the humor in this nice little comedy about two men revisiting their pasts and rebuilding their futures.",1164931200,,1059,4.652406417112299
1342643,4,B00004RF89,"An excellent comedy, with great casting.  Bullying is a serious topic, and it is shown as such, but there is plenty of comedy to keep it from being too depressing or dark of a movie.  The behind the scenes look at teachers' lives is priceless.  The final scenes are extreme and weird; for a while I thought it was a dream sequence.  More could have been done at the end, showing the developing friendship between the former bully/victim.  But all in all, it is great to watch.",1139443200,2,476,4.425287356321839
1342644,5,B00004RF89,"David Leary(Rick Moranis) and his young son Ben move to Minnesota from California where David takes a teaching position at an elementary school that Ben will be attending. David himself is a Minnesota native and attended the same school when he was a boy. The Learys' new neighbor is Art Lundstrom(Jeffrey Tambor) and his wife Betty(Faith Prince). The Lundstroms immediately welcomed the Learys upon the Learys' arrival. ""We won't need the Weather Channel while they're living next door to us."",David tells Ben. Art noticed some ugly cracks in the Learys' deck and offered some of his stain for replenishing the deck. Art says,""Make sure you apply a few extra coats otherwise the moisture will seep into the wood and rot it from the inside."". Art tells about the biting sunfish at Lake Rebecca. Also he offers his tuba to Ben. Ben hates Minnesota and would rather stay in California. Ben misses his mother who is David's ex-wife. The next morning,Art is chopping wood in the pleasant sunshine. David's childhood acquaintance Roscoe Bigger(Tom Arnold) comes along and continues to pick on David,despite they're both now adults. Don Knotts is the school principal who has Ben and Roscoe's son Kirby in his office for fighting. Then there's a circulating rumor that David killed Roscoe in a waterfall. David himself believed he committed the murder. All he did was push Roscoe with a long piece of plywood into the waterfall. David tells Art late one evening,while Art was pruning hedges,that David killed shop teacher Roscoe. ""Everyone knows you two had a twisted relationship."",Art tells David. Julianne Phillips plays David's girlfriend,who also teaches at the school. During childhood,Roscoe stole what's called a ""moonrock"" because of his aspiration of becoming an astronaut,which never happened. Eventually,David and Roscoe become friends and both their families move out of Minnesota together. WOOLY BULLY,performed by Sam the Sham & the Pharoahs is played during the opening credits. The song was on hit parade in 1965. The film was directed by Steve Miner,who also directed 1986's SOUL MAN. Those who saw this film also CARPOOL,also starring Arnold and Moranis's other films such as HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS,HONEY I BLEW UP THE KID,HONEY WE SHRUNK OURSELVES,MY BLUE HEAVEN,GHOSTBUSTERS and GHOSTBUSTERS 2.",1112659200,3,2310,5.22911051212938
1342645,2,B00004RF89,"Every so often Hollywood takes a serious theme like murder or bullying and tries to make light of it.  When that attempt gropes toward the inner pain of dark comedy, the film may have merit.  Yet when the focus is on cheap nonlaughs surrounded by a total disregard for substance, logic, and human decency, the result is most often a bloated, turgid mess like BIG BULLY.

Director Steven Miner wastes the limited talents of all concerned.  Rick Moranis is a weedy, nerdy little man who has to relive the trauma of childhood bullying by beefy Tom Arnold.  As the film opens, both Moranis and Arnold are in the fourth grade.  Arnold plays a blubbery bully that one sometimes sees in a filmed version of a Steven King horror movie.  But in the hands of a King based script, the bully is a source of unredeemed evil.  Here, under Miner's unsure grasp, Arnold is no more than a walking tub of prepubescent lard who seeks to bully the nerdy Moranis.  Now if Miner had tried to make a serious movie about childhood bullying, then BIG BULLY might have had something worthwhile to say about the angst of childhood insecurities.

Now flashforward twenty years.  Moranis and Arnold are both teachers in the same grammar school, and Arnold quickly reverts to the bully that he was.  What makes this regression reprehensible is Arnold's justification that as a victim, Moranis thoroughly deserved his fate.  What then follows is a ridiculous chase scene between prey and predator that offers no lasting insight into either demented personality.  Julianne Phillips is a wasted toss in as Moranis' girlfriend.  At the end, when director Miner seeks closure, the film ends in the uneasiest of endings, one that satisfied neither the desire for revenge nor one that offers justification for that revenge in the first place.",1109462400,,1805,4.833876221498372
1342646,5,B00004RF89,"i personaly think the film is great. Not hard to understand. The main plot is that two school kids (rick moranis and tom arnold) don't get along with eachover at school and they grow up and both work at a school while rick is still scared of tom and then toms child is getting bullied by ben (ricks child) but of course, as you could imagine,........ it all ends hapily ever after!",1090195200,2,381,4.305555555555555
1342647,1,B00004RF89,"This movie is absolutely awful. Good lord. How do these scripts get MADE INTO FILM? An absolute waste of time, film, and money. Oh, so you mean Moranis got picked on by Arnold when they were kids, but now they're older, and he's not so bad a guy, but Moranis is still spooked? Oh, and Moranis' son is now picking on Arnold's son? Oh, brilliant! Greenlight! COME ON! THIS IS FILTH!",1076284800,,380,4.366197183098592

7920943,5,B00004RF89,"Being born in 1990 I remember alot of really cool films from that time,and this is a gem. I'll say this may contain SPOILERS:But for parents some humor well understand,like drug references,which are hilarious cuz Tom Arnold is in it.great cast with Don Knotts as the principal of the school that Rick Moranis goes to.well he used too,when he was a kid & young Tom Arnold was his bully.years later Miranis,a writer & somewhat of a local hometown hero ,ironically his son bullies Tom Arnolds son. The 2 pick up their feud like it never ended and its just a funny movie.adults will dig it,people like me who reminisce about the 90s & want their kids to see funny films we grew up with.i suggest you get it & enjoy.",1498694400,,711,4.476923076923077
