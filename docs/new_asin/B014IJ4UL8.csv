8730879,1,B014IJ4UL8,"Save your money and buy the Marley Documentary. It starts out just playing with no title screen or anything, very outdated and old news shows. The love stuff is great but only has four songs on it. I love Marley to death but this is just Dvd is made strictly for somebody to get rich and make a quick buck off his legacy and name. Sad really, any True Fan will be extremely disappointed from this video. If I could give it -5 stars I would. Check out Marley Uprising for another great video.
