8629681,4,B00H445RVC,"CNBlue are undeniably a great band. I am glad they included English subtitles for the show and the ""making of"" disc. There is a lot of banter...too much banter of the ""are you having fun?"" type. It looked like JongHyun was a little tired of all the YongHwa and JungShin chatter. Frankly it was a bit tiresome to me as well. Lots of great songs though. It think if all you ever saw was the concert though you'd have the impression that YongHwa is pretty full of himself. But he comes across as much more humble in the off-stage moments. Certainly a good show though.",1420156800,,565,4.390476190476191
8629682,5,B00H445RVC,"I loved everything about this album... love the concert in Seoul, Korea... they are the best... Better than singles, and you get to see the guys play with the audience, which is funny and adorable..and they are all great doing what they do.  The 2nd DVD is an interview and some behind the scene stuff.  that I really love... very happy with this one.",1412035200,,351,4.46875

8629685,5,B00H445RVC,"Purchased this concert 2-DVD set on 2/9/14 and received it on 2/15, so delivery was super fast and arrived in great condition. This is my 3rd concert by CNBLUE I own and I am not disappointed! I have been keeping up with them after seeing Yong Hwa (lead vocal and guitar) and Min Hyuk (drums) in the K Drama ""Heartstrings"" on Dramafever back in 2011. ""BLUE MOON"" features newly edited versions of ""Y, Why"" and ""Feeling"" along with the addition of new songs like ""La, La, La,"" and ""A Guy Like Me."" The guys seem to be leaning more toward rock these days and Jung Shin on bass guitar has more vocals this time around. If you enjoy guitar-driven soft rock/pop, you should give these guys a listen. Their sound is catchy and toe-tapping. Although most of the lyrics are in Korean, some songs include English phrases and a few are sung in English. Their banter and conversation between songs is available with English subtitles. And for us ladies, they aren't bad to look at, either!",1392422400,6,978,4.5625
8629686,5,B00H445RVC,"I got to see the Blue Moon concert in person, so I had to buy this DVD when it came out. This way I can see their performance anytime I want in my own home. This DVD come with 2 discs, the first disc contain the entire concert. The band sings their most popular songs, like I'm a loner, Love, Love girl, In my head, These days, Get away, Wake up, Intuition, Y why, Love light, You've fallen for me, Just please, Have a good night, One time, Feeling, Try again, Smile again, and new songs like I'm sorry, Coffee shop, A guy like me, and La La La. The concert was very entertaining (band members, especially Jung Yong Hwa dancing, singing and engaging with the audience) and the band sounds great live as always. The 2nd discs contain back stage rehearsal which I loved, I really enjoy seeing the band members having fun singing, jamming, and laughing in the studio. It also have English subtitled. I would recommend this DVD to all the CNBLUE fans that did or did not get to attend their concert because watching it will feet like you are at their concert again or are there at their concert. I also recommend it to all the music lovers out there that have never listen to Korean music, this band will make you fall in love with their music.",1391817600,7,1240,4.32618025751073
