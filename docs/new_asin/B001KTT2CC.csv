8316106,2,B001KTT2CC,"It's hard to believe that people were highly entertained by this film,
but that's what they had in 1929, in the way of romantic comedies, I guess.
A very light romantic comedy, with
very light singing and dancing. Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor are adults, in this,
but the dialog that they have to speak is on a child's level, I'd say. The
comedy also makes you think of children doing a play - very slight comedy. So slight
that I kept thinking, ""they laughed at this in 1929?""
But again, this was not too long after movies began to talk. Charles Farrell
and Janet Gaynor became very popular and made several movies together. I'm glad I
saw this film, but I wouldn't say that it's a ""must see"" movie. Rent it, if you are
curious about what people watched in 1929.",1360800000,,767,4.408450704225352
