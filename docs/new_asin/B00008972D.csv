1830261,5,B00008972D,"With Volume 6 of Season One of ""I Love Lucy"" we are in the second half of the season as the show was really starting to hit stride.  Lucy temporarily puts aside her eternal quest to get into show business by playing the helpful wife and neighbor on this particular quartet of episodes:
Episode 20, ""The Fans"" (February 25, 1952) has a young bobby-soxer (Janet Waldo) developing a crush on Ricky.  Fortunately Lucy is there to help save Ricky.  This episode is of historic note because it was the debut of William Asher as a director on the show.  While this was the only first season episode not directed by Marc Daniels, Asher would be the primary director on ""I Love Lucy"" for the rest of its run.  Richard Crenna also appears in this episode; he was about to become a notable character on ""Our Miss Brooks,"" which was also produced by Desilu.
Episode 21, ""New Neighbors"" (March 3, 1952) has Lucy and Ethel getting the wrong idea about the new couple have just moved into the building.  Yes, that is Hayden Rorke from ""I Dream of Jeannie"" you see in this episode.  This is a good DVD for spotting future TV stars.
Episode 22, ""Fred and Ethel Fight"" (March 10, 1952) is something of a misnomer as a title, because while the episode starts off giving second bananas Vivian Vance and William Frawley a chance to shine as the Mertzes have a fight, it is Lucy and Rick who end up just about destroying their own marriage trying to help Fred and Ethel make up.
Episode 23, ""The Mustache"" (March 17, 192) presents a classic sitution comedy Lucy plot.  Ricky has grown a mustache.  Lucy does not like Ricky's mustache.  To show him the error of his ways, Lucy comes up with her own false whiskers.  However, she has, of course, put on the mustache a little bit too well...
Overall there is a nice thematic unity to these four episodes as Lucy tries time and time again to be helpful and only succeeds in making matters worse.  ""The Mustache"" is another great example of Lucille Ball's skills as a comedian, even when all she is working with is a fake mustache.  All of these episodes were written by the legendary team of Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh, and Bob Carroll, Jr.  The second half of Season One is clearly a lot stronger, and the best is yet to come (one word:  Vitametavegamin).",1053302400,6,2284,4.49636803874092
1830262,5,B00008972D,"I LOVE LUCY continues on DVD with the 6th volume of episodes from the historic first season.
""The Young Fans"" - Ricky and Lucy unwittingly become embroiled in the love-lives of two teenagers (Janet Waldo and Richard Crenna).  It's up to Lucy to take drastic action!...
""New Neighbors"" - A new couple moves into the building.  As usual, Lucy and Ethel snoop around to find out all their secrets, but a misunderstanding leads them to believe that the neighbors are Russian spies!
""Fred and Ethel Fight"" - The Mertzes are having a rough patch in their marriage, so Ricky and Lucy decide to get them back together - and almost break up themselves!!
""The Moustache"" - In order to get Ricky to shave off his new moustache, Lucy glues on a fake beard...with disastrous results!
Starring Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance and William Frawley.  The DVD includes flubs, guest-cast information, a bonus episode of  the ""My Favorite Husband"" radio show, production notes and restored elements.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1052352000,5,1022,5.023668639053255

1830277,5,B00008972D,"Crap . . . what did I write on the others?  I wanted to use the same review for each of the box sets, but I missed this one.  Dangit.  Oh well . . . I Love Lucy truly was an amazing show.  Did you know that we have this show (and Desi Arnaz specifically) to thank for much of what became the home video market, not to mention certain other classic shows like Star Trek?  He was one of the first to start deliberately making backup copies of his episodes for future use and after the success of I Love Lucy he went on to produce shows like Star Trek.  Seriously, if I Love Lucy hadn't taken off it could have been much longer before the home video market really took off and we may have missed out on some truly grat television.

As far as I Love Lucy, seriously, any season is worth your time.  It's one of the most timeless shows in the history of television media.",1484179200,,866,4.052941176470588

1830294,5,B00008972D,"As someone who grew up watching I Love Lucy, these are still favorites. I think this may be my favorite season, although there are episodes in the previous seasons that I love. But not all of them. Lucy, while funny, was also very childish, often pouting to get her way. I don't care for the episodes when she's trying to get into show business. No particular reason...those just don't appeal to me. I love the episodes where she's getting int mischief of other kinds. I love the episodes where the Ricardos and the Mertzes are having spats. Those, to me, are some of the funniest. However, I fear I stray from my point...which is Season 6. As many times as I've seen these I thought I'd seen them all. However, there are three or four here that I had never seen. One is their trip to Cuba to visit Ricky's family. The part toward the end where he performs with Little Ricky is priceless, and, I do believe, one of THE best scenes of the entire series. I love the shows where they've moved to the country. Lucy seems to have 'grown up' a bit. She's less manipulative. These are great entertainment! I'm ordering other seasons and can't wait to get them.",1475193600,3,1153,4.443396226415095

1830442,5,B00008972D,I found seasons 1&2 at Walmart when I was like 20 months pregnant and had nothing else to do and was tired of daytime TV. They didn't sell the other seasons and of course I had to have them. I found them all on Amazon(cheaper) and ordered them. Season 4 came first and then 3 and 5 came and I watched all 3 seasons over the weekend(I don't sleep at night and night time tv is worse than daytime). Really brings back memories of watching this on TV land growing up. Lucy and her antics keep me laughing. Although after watching them all over again being a bit older...I have come to find that though I love the simplicity of the 50s era and the fashion....Ricky is a dillweed. I told my husband if he acted that way I would probably kick him. But that's just me.,1393372800,,761,4.183673469387755

1830461,5,B00008972D,"I ordered the 6th Season of ""I Love Lucy"" to supplement my VCR copies taped from TV.

No commercials, no cutting of shows, just full unedited viewing.  I was surprised to see scenes that had been snipped.  I enjoy looking at reruns and so I knew immediately when there were scenes that I had never seen before.  It was watching it new again in that way.

I enjoy listening to the radio shows of  ""My Favorite Husband"" included on each disc.  Since radio was decades before my time, it is novel and interesting to me.  When we take road trips for vacations, the radio shows like ""Fibber McGee and Molly,""  ""Our Miss Brooks,"" ""Baby Snooks,"" ""Henry Aldrich,"" ""My Favorite Husband,"" and ""You Bet Your Life Grocho Marx Shows"" keep us thoroughly entertained and help the drive time pass quickly.

I also find the side notes of information on supporting casts, original sponsors show openings, hearing original music that was replaced when the show went into reruns returned.

My family and I found the price just right and feel this was definitely a great investment.  Little by little, for our all time favorite classic comedy shows that we enjoy catching when and if they show up on cable, are nice to have in our personal collection.  We no longer enjoy the networks that these shows originated on in the 50's and 60's, and it is uncertain when they will show up in primetime on cable stations.

So our evenings are spent keeping our hearts merry with these types of programs along with ""The Andy Griffith Shows"" with Barney Fife (Don Knotts) and Gomer Pyle (Jim Nabors) in particluar, ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" (with all the cast), ""That Girl"" with Marlo Thomas and Ted Bessell and cast.  Having these VCR and now DVD sets are wonderful, along with TCM Classic comedy movies and musicals from the late 30's, the 40's and 50's.  The only things we really watch that cable offers are some PBS Create TV Travel shows, other retro cable stations with shows like ""Father Knows Best,"" ""Dennis the Menace,"" and ""Hazel"" and some cable ministries.

This DVD set arrived ""next day"" which was definitely sooner than expected,  A very welcome surprise since we were leaving for a vacation the next day.  It followed us on our trip and we enjoyed watching it at the hotel through our travel sized DVD player.

If you like, as I do, some of the later seasons of I Love Lucy the best, you won't be disappointed with this purchase!",1380672000,2,2412,4.617370892018779

1830508,5,B00008972D,"Season 6 of I LOVE LUCY has always been one of my TV favorites.  It's certainly funny, in the gentle, innocent way that the show was funny, but it also provides some warm memories for those of us who grew up in the late 50's.  When the Ricardos and the Mertzes move to Connecticut, it is an illustration of what I was taught the American dream was all about:  a house in the peaceful suburbs whose style was a reflection of colonial America, neighbors with whom you had a warm and close relationship, and a certainty that life would be secure.

Though the life changed dramatically during the 60's, and those changes provided a vital and exciting world in which to live, it's fun to revisit a time when life was less frenetic, when our innocence was intact and cynicism had not become the norm.  On a snowy afternoon, it's great to curl up and visit Lucy and Ricky in Westport!",1349136000,,877,4.422360248447205

1830514,5,B00008972D,I have been a Lucy fan for many years and thoroughly enjoyed this set.. One can truly appreciate how gifted a comedienne Lucille Ball was after viewing these segments. I laughed my sides off when she tried to impersonate a cigar roller in Cuba to escape from Ricky's uncle and roared when she played Superman for little Ricky's birthday party so he would not be disappointed. Each episode was funnier than the previous one... I intend to purchase EACH season and enjoy the hilarity associated with this all too funny crew. In this ever crazy world we all could use some hearty laughs like these!,1304380800,,595,4.6761904761904765
1830515,5,B00008972D,"Season six of this wonderful series is just excellent, with some really great episodes, which I consider to be some of the best in the entire series, lots of things happening in this season, firstly we go to Cuba and Florida with the Ricardo's and the Mertze's, and then we move to the country with the Ricardo's and The Mertze's let Mrs. Trumble take over and manage the apartment house so that the Mertze's can move in with Lucy and Ricky and take up a business proposition in raising chickens, this is an excellent time in the series.

Many standout episodes are found here, beginning right off with a classic which is 'Lucy and Bob Hope' in which Lucy finds Bob Hope himself at a baseball game at Yankee Stadium, and makes a fool of herself, and with a really great ending song, and then we get another fantastic episode in 'Little Ricky Learns to Play the Drums' in which Lucy and Ricky argue over what Little Ricky is going to be when he grows up, Lucy thinks he should be a doctor, Ricky thinks he should be a drummer, but when the drum pounding goes overboard, it causes trouble between the Ricardo's and Mertze's with some hilarious results, but at the end of course, they make up, 'Visitor from Italy' is another standout episode, and then we go to Florida with the Ricardo's and Mertze's, and in 'Off To Florida' Lucy loses the train tickets and Fred and Ricky are already in Florida, so Lucy and Ethel are stuck having to hitch a ride to Florida, the driver 'Elsa Lanchester' great episode, 'Deep Sea Fishing' continues the Florida segment, where Lucy gets a bet going with the boys over who can catch the biggest fish, and of course Ethel is dragged into it, but Lucy has an idea on how to win, but so do the boys!

'The Ricardo's Visit Cuba' is another fantastic episode, this is the episodes that features Lucy the cigar roller, and produces hilarious results! 'Christmas Show' is one that I've never seen before because it was never shown in reruns, and seeing that I'm 30 years old, I obviously didn't see this series in it's original broadcast, so this will be a nice new surprise for me, 'Lucy and The Loving Cup' is one that really brings back memories for me, because I had some of those old VHS tapes of I Love Lucy that Paramount released, I think there were two episodes on each one, and I had the tape with this one on it, and this episode is absolutely fantastic, we all know Lucille was great at physical comedy, and this one further proves that point, Lucy brings home a new hat, and Ricky and Fred think it looks ridiculous, so in a joking manner, Lucy decides to put on a loving cup that Ricky intended for 'Johnny Longden' to have, but once Lucy gets it on, she can't get it off! and has to ride the subway with the cup on her head, GREAT! 'Lucy and Superman' is another great one here, featuring the original and best Superman in 'George Reeves'.

'Lucy Wants to Move to the Country' 'Lucy Hates to Leave' 'Lucy Misses the Merze's' 'Lucy Gets Chummy With the Neighbors' 'Lucy Raises Chickens' 'Lucy Does the Tango' are all part of the moving to the country saga, and it's just terrific with some hilarious moments, but also some heartwarming moments between the Ricardo's and Mertze's, 'Housewarming' 'Building a Bar-B-Q' 'Country Club Dance' (starring Barbara Eden) 'Lucy Raises Tulips' are all terrific episodes, and the last of the I Love Lucy's 'The Ricardo's Dedicate a Statue'

Now of course the remaining seasons are all the 'Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour' ones, and continue with the Ricardo's and Mertze's living in the country together, but this was a great end to the original I Love Lucy, and now I have this series completed finally, now I can watch them any time I want, and as I've stated in my other reviews of this set on DVD, CBS/Paramount really did it with this series, the remastering job is stunning as is the audio, the reruns I watched surely never looked this good, and all the bonus features are excellent, and whats really nice about this season, is that you can watch the episodes with the original sponsor openings, or the syndicated openings, nice touch.

So there you have it, this is a terrific season of the beloved show, and should be part of your collection with the rest of the series, you will not be disappointed!",1299283200,2,4275,4.532383419689119

I wanted to see the episode where Superman visits their apartment. And I was pleased to see that the episode had a full commentary track featuring now grown ""Little Ricky"", as well as Caroline Applebee and her son from the show.

Superman was a big icon back in the 50's. And George Reeves ""gives his all"" in this Superman episode. Just watch his crashing thru to the living room from the kitchen. Any kid would believe he could fly and had super-powers back then. And that entrance pretty much cinched it.

Just listen to ""Little Ricky's"" commentary track. He even says that there were MANY stars that appeared on the program, but it was Superman that excited him the most.

Great seeing George Reeves as Superman again, and there's plenty of ""Lucy"" comedy on the show as well. One of my favorite episodes.",1228780800,,935,4.456140350877193

1830579,5,B00008972D,"This collection is the final collection of a true classic sit-com.  ""I Love Lucy"" originally aired 50 years ago and still gets lots of laughs today.

The series makes little tweaks with their proven successful formula, but much of the structure remains the same.  As the season opens, Ricky Ricardo (Desi Arnaz) is buying the nightclub he has worked at since the series opened.  Still at home is his wife Lucy (Lucille Ball) who is just as likely to get involved in some crazy situation as always.  Rounding out the regulars are neighbors and good friends Fred and Ethel Mertz (William Frawley and Vivian Vance).

For this season, the decision was made to age Lucy and Ricky's son, Little Ricky.  By all rights, he should only be four for this season.  However, he is suddenly six and played by ""Richard"" Keith Thibodeaux.  This allows them to do stories involving him.  He develops an interest in drums, much to everyone's dismay.  At his music school recital, he develops stage fright.  The whole gang gets involved in his school musical.  And he even gets a dog and the Ricardos try to keep it in their New York apartment.

Not all the stories revolve around him, however.  Lucy only tries to get into Ricky's act a couple of times, both times with celebrities.  Yep, she still makes a fool out of herself any time someone famous comes around.  This time, the victims are Bob Hope and Orson Wells.  George Reeves as Superman also stops by for Little Ricky's birthday party.  In one of the more famous episodes from the season, Lucy gets a trophy stuck on her head and has to make her way across town even though she can't see a thing.

The Ricardos and Mertzes take a trip to Florida and Cuba during the season.  My favorite of the episodes surrounding this trip is ""Deep Sea Fishing"" in which the couples make a bet over who will catch the biggest fish.  Then they secretly each buy a huge fish and try to hide it from each other.

About half way through the season, the Ricardos decide to move to the suburbs.  Naturally, they can't go alone, and it isn't long before the Mertzes have moved with them to help raise chickens.  This leads to the most famous episode from the season, ""Lucy Does the Tango.""  Lucy and Ethel are trying to hide eggs in the chicken coop when Ricky decides he wants to go over the tango routine he and Lucy are going to perform at the PTA.  It drew the longest laugh from the studio audience in the history of the show.

By the time the season is over, the cast and writers had done 179 episodes of the show.  While there are still some great episodes left, there are a few that feel like retreads.  ""Ragtime Band"" features Lucy, Ethel, and Fred trying to form a band with disastrous results, a la the third season's ""Lucy's Club Dance.""  An attractive single woman capturing the men's attention, in ""Country Club Dance"" an idea similar to ""Charm School,"" again from season three.  While the show has used familiar ideas before, these seem pale imitations of the originals.

Even given these familiar storylines, the season as a whole has plenty of laughs.  The previously mentioned episodes are hilarious.  When the gang visits Cuba, Ricky gets a chance to make fun of Lucy's Spanish (and it's worse then his English by far).  Adjusting to the quiet of the country after all the years in the city provides some great laughs as well.  It's just too quiet for Lucy to sleep.  And the tale of the runaway lawnmower from ""Lucy Raises Tulips"" is hysterical as well.

Included in the set is the Christmas special.  It incorporates new scenes with flashbacks to the episodes about the birth of Little Ricky from season two.  The new scenes were colorized in the 80's, and both the original black and white and the color versions are available in this set.  Let me just say that ""I Love Lucy"" should only be viewed in black and white, at least as far as I'm concerned.

This season set has been put together with the same care as the previous five.  The picture is still extremely sharp and the sound is perfectly clear.  All the usual deleted scenes, flubs, guest cast, and original openings are present, along with five more episodes of Lucy's radio show ""My Favorite Husband.""  For the first time, you have the choice of watching the episodes with their original opening or the more famous hearts on satin used for the reruns.

Additionally, this set includes three audio commentaries, a first for the series on DVD.  While the first two have some entertaining information in them, guest star Barbara Eden's commentary on ""Country Club Dance"" really has very little information in it.  Then again, since she only guest starred in that one episode, I wasn't expecting too much from her.  Doris Singleton (Caroline Appleby) and Keith Thibodeaux share thoughts on ""Lucy and Superman"" while series writers Madelyn Pugh Davis and Bob Schiller talk about ""Lucy Does the Tango.""  Both of these have some great behind the scenes memories of the show.

While not the best the show has to offer, there are still plenty of classic moments and laughs to make this set worth getting.  I'm thrilled to have a complete set of one of my favorite shows of all time.  Here's hoping they go on to release the unofficial final 13 episodes known as ""The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour.""",1150675200,11,5283,4.617615467239528

1830582,5,B00008972D,"This is truly by far one of the best boxed sets for any ""I Love Lucy Fan."" My favorite episodes are when they move to the country and when they are in Miami Beach. These episodes are timeless and still make anyone laugh 50 yrs later.

Besides the hee-larious antics of my favorite redhead, this collection has two great audio commentaries--Keith Thibodeaux and Barbara Eden!

1830590,5,B00008972D,"Finally, Season Six, the final season is HERE!  I would have bought all seasons at once (as is an option today), but instead bought them as they were released.  Now, if only someone would release all the seasons of MAMA'S FAMILY with Vicki Lawrence!  There are so many people I know saying they'd buy MAMA'S FAMILY if it were only available on DVD.  It's not even on VHS!!  Please, would ANY production company get the rights to release MAMA'S FAMILY on DVD.  Second to I LOVE LUCY, I think MAMA'S FAMILY is the funniest thing next in line.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed!!  Anyway, anyone who buys Season Six will NOT be disappointed.  I especially like ""Building a Bar-B-Q,"" ""Lucy Raises Chickens,"" ""Lucy Raises Tulips,"" and ""Off To Florida"" (the episode about the suspected ax murderer with whom Lucy and Ethel travel with to Florida, and whose driver thinks Lucy is the ax murderer with her accomplice).  Also, I greatly recommend KEEPING UP APPEARANCES with Patricia Routledge.  If you can, buy all eight DVDs of KEEPING UP APPEARANCES and follow it along from DVD #1 all the way through DVD #8.  I greatly admire Patricia Routledge comedy who is so VERY, VERY funny playing Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced Bouquet, Booo-Kay), an etiquette-obsessed socialite, and her hen-pecked husband and various sisters(Rose the floosey, Daisy and unkempt husband Onslow, Violet and sexual deviant husband Bruce), her supposedly gay son Sheridan, neighbors (Elizabeth and Emmett), and various town acquaintances (e.g., the Vicar and his wife, the Major, Mrs. Fortescue, and Lydia Hawksworth, et al.).  I HIGHLY recommend KEEPING UP APPEARANCES.  Of course, there's always the hilarious ARE YOU BEING SERVED.  Both of these series are produced by BBC America.  You won't be disappointed in ANY of these recommendations, and they will provide you hours of hilarity to help you escape the hectic world we live in today!!

My favorite episode is when the girls want to dance with their husbands and all they want to do is dance and mingle with a young attractive blonde played by a pre-I dream of Jeannie, Barbara Eden. This show ended at the right time, when they show was still on top. Buy, borrow or rent this season, I Love Lucy was the best show of the 1950s.",1146268800,5,592,4.247787610619469
1830592,5,B00008972D,"I have been a fan of ""I Love Lucy"" since grade school days in the 1960's when I watched, for the first time, in reruns in the morning. Our CBS affiliate ran reruns of the show in the mornings and I would watch them. Needless to say I was hooked at a young age and haven't regretted it at all! When I watch an episode that I know I've seen dozens of times, I still laugh. Each time I see something new in the episode. Many years ago I found several pieces of the china used on the set, the Franciscan ""Ivy"" pattern. I call this my Lucy plates and use them on occassion. You really had to ""watch"" the show to see these kind of details!

I am hoping that we'll see the ""Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"" on DVD soon. These were comedy at it's BEST! The guest stars that were brought in really added to the mix of comedy and hilarity! My favorite is the episode with Betty Davis - what a charming actress and she was funny! The antics of Lucy Ricardo the neighbor, star struck with Miss Davis living next door was wonderful material for what was to come! This was comedy at it's prime!

After a bumpy start, Paramount has been issuing great season boxed sets of LUCY & DESI's TV triumph, and they are to be commended for such care to be taken with a national treasure.

Equally exciting for me is that the same day the DVD curtain falls on the original 6 seasons of I LOVE LUCY, Warner is also releasing the only three big-screen appearances of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz together ina LUCY/DESI Movie collection, with the highlight being their best blockbuster, the insanely funny laugh-fest, THE LONG, LONG TRAILER accompanied by FOREVER, DARLING and

1830596,5,B00008972D,"In season four Lucy goes to Hollywood and in season five she goes to Europe.  So this season, she gives up city life to live in the suburbs.

The transition is handled well with a reason to bring Fred and Ethel along.  And Mary Jane Croft becomes a regular and will become Lucy's long time partner in crime in future sereies after Vivian Vance retires.

The season begins in New York and features guests Bob Hope and Orson Welles.  Then the gang goes to Florida and Elsa Lanchester makes a great guest appearance.  The trip ends with a visit Havana and Lucy wreaking havoc at Ricky's uncle's cigar factory.  The gang returns to NYC for a few more episodes that includes a visit from Superman.

For the last half of the season Lucy decides to move to Connecticutt.  This gives a whole new group of adventures for the gang to embark on.  Lucy decideds to raise chickens but learns it is not so simple.  The boys build a barbecue and the girls tear it apart.  Lucy has fun making her garden grow.  And look for Barbara Eden at the country club dance.

At the end of the season, Lucy and Desi's marriage was on the rock and so they ended the series ad did a series of one hour specials.

I Love Lucy is a classic of early television.  And since this was the first show to be filmed on stock instead of kinescope, these DVD's are crystal clear.  The one thing is to watch for the really fake backgrounds.  When they were broadcast on small non-digtal scenes, they looked real but with the new technology, you will see backgrounds that look fake but that is part of the charm of old shows.

Well six seasons down and let's look for the eleven Lucy and Desi Hours!",1142812800,34,1657,4.3387622149837135

I'm very happy that I had the opportunity to share these series with my nieces (7 and 3) and they love them. You don't get sick of seeing Lucille Ricardo or Ricky Ricardo... instead you enjoy them even more. I do recommend these series to anyone who wants to laugh... and can't stop laughing.

1830598,5,B00008972D,"Over 50 years ago during the early years of broadcast television, the very inspired talents of Lucille Ball (1911-1989) and her then husband Desi Arnaz (1917-1986) were showcased on their hilarious television show ""I Love Lucy"". TV execs had initially rejected the plausibility of the show because of Desi and because they intended to tape the shows. However, thanks to the tireless efforts of Lucille Ball and Desi's obvious talents, the show first aired in 1951 and quickly became one of the most successful TV shows during all six of its regular seasons. As Lucy and Ricky Ricardo on ""I Love Lucy"", Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were joined by William Frawley (1877-1966) and Viviane Vance (1909-1979) as their best-friends/apartment landlords of Fred and Ethel Mertz.

The sixth & final season of ""I Love Lucy"" that aired between 1956 and 1957 had 26 memorable episodes and one special:

1. ""Lucy and Bob Hope"": After Lucy spots Bob Hope (himself, 1903-2003) at a baseball game, she attempts to contact him by pretending to be a hotdog vendor and a pitcher.

2. ""Little Ricky Learns to Play the Drums"": Thump. Thump. Thump, thump, thump. Little Ricky (Keith Thibodeaux) learning to play the drums starts to drive everyone crazy; including Fred & Ethel with his persistent rhythm.

3. ""Lucy Meets Orson Welles"": After Lucy gets to perform with Orson Wells (himself, 1915-1985) at the Tropicana, she tries to turn his magic-act into Shakespeare to impress her old drama teacher in the audience.

4. ""Little Ricky Gets Stage Fright"": Little Ricky appears fine before he debuts his drumming skills in front of an audience, but then panics immediately before the show.

5. ""Visitor from Italy"": Mario (Jay Novello, 1904-1982) from Italy comes to visit on his way to San Franchesca to see his brother, but Lucy thinks it's supposed to be San Francisco so she helps Mario get a job in a pizza parlor to raise money, only to have to flip some pizza dough herself.

6. ""Off to Florida"": To visit Ricky & Fred in Florida, Lucy & Ethel carpool with Mrs. Edna Grundy (Elsa Lanchester, 1902-1986) and her watercress sandwiches, but they come to think that she is a murderer after hearing a report on the car radio.

7. ""Deep-Sea Fishing"": Still in Florida, the gang goes out on a boat to go fishing with the women betting the men on who can catch the biggest fish.

8. ""Desert Island"": To stop Ricky & Fred from judging a Florida beauty contest, Lucy & Ethel make it appear that their boat runs out of gas, leaving them stranded on seemingly deserted island.

9. ""The Ricardos Visit Cuba"": Finally visiting Cuba after many years, Lucy gets the opportunity to meet more of Ricky's relatives, but ends up trying to hide while rolling cigars.

10. ""Little Ricky's School Pageant"": Ricky, Lucy, Fred & Ethel appear in Little Ricky's school show with Lucy as a wicked witch.

Special: ""'I Love Lucy' Christmas Show"": A.K.A. ""Jingle Bells"" or ""The Lost Episode"", this special has the gang reminiscing as they decorate a Christmas tree.

11. ""Lucy and the Loving Cup"": Lucy gets a trophy stuck on top of her head.

12. ""Lucy and Superman"": Lucy pretends to be Superman for Little Ricky's birthday, but then the real Superman (George Reeves, 1914-1959) shows up.

13. ""Little Ricky Gets a Dog"": When Little Ricky gets a puppy, no one is happy with its non-stop, late-night barking.

14. ""Lucy Wants to Move to the Country"": After Lucy wants her, Ricky & Little Ricky to buy a home in Connecticut, she starts to have second thoughts and gets help from Ethel & Fred to sour the deal with the sellers: Mr. & Mrs. Spaulding (Frank Wilcox, 1907-1974, & Eleanor Audley, 1905-1991).

15. ""Lucy Hates to Leave"": The Ricardos with their belongings temporarily move in with the Mertz's until they can move into their new Connecticut home.

16. ""Lucy Misses the Mertzes"": Alone in their new home, Ricky & Lucy decide to visit Fred & Ethel in New York, but Fred & Ethel decide to visit Ricky & Lucy.

17. ""Lucy Gets Chummy with the Neighbors"": Like Lucy ever needed an excuse to buy new furniture, her new friend & next-door neighbor Betty Ramsay (Mary Jane Croft, 1916-1999) helps to convince Lucy that she needs to.

18. ""Lucy Raises Chickens"": To help pay their bills, Lucy & Ricky decide to get chickens and sell the eggs; so Lucy & Ethel buy 500 baby chicks that Little Ricky finds hidden away and accidentally lets loose.

19. ""Lucy Does the Tango"": After Ricky threatens to sell their chickens that won't lay eggs and he & Fred aren't speaking to each other, Lucy plans to plant store-bought eggs in the nests; but she also has to hide them and practice the Tango with Ricky with some sticky results.

20. ""Ragtime Band"": When Ricky refuses to perform with Lucy, Fred & Ethel for a benefit, she gets Little Ricky on the drums instead.

21. ""Lucy's Night in Town"": Lucy, Ricky, Fred & Ethel plan to see a New York play, but problems arise, including Fred getting nervous about carrying $500 in cash.

22. ""Housewarming"": Ethel's jealousy of Betty Ramsey's friendship with Lucy quickly becomes Lucy's jealousy of Ethel when Ethel & Betty find out that their both from Albuquerque. Things get worse when Lucy thinks that Ethel is planning a surprise housewarming party for her & Ricky.

23. ""Building a Bar-B-Q"": Ricky & Fred build a wonderful brick barbeque, but Lucy thinks her wedding ring fell into the cement; so she & Ethel take it apart looking, then attempt to put it back together with hilarious results.

24. ""Country Club Dance"": Lucy, Ethel & Betty get mad at their husbands that all become smitten with a young blond (Barbara Eden) at a dance.

25. ""Lucy Raises Tulips"": Tulips and riding lawnmowers don't go together, which is what Lucy finds out when she tries to mow her yard and takes out Betty's prize tulips. Lucy also discovers that wax tulips don't do well in the sun.

26. ""The Ricardos Dedicate a Statue"": In the very last regular ""I Love Lucy"" episode, after Lucy accidentally destroys the statue to be dedicated, she pretends to be the statue. The real children of Lucille Ball & Desi Arnaz (Lucie Arnaz & Desi Arnaz, Jr.) made uncredited cameo appearances.

To date, Paramount Home Video has done a superb job of packaging the various episodes of the first five seasons of ""I Love Lucy"" on DVD, so it's a good indication that they'll do as good a job with the sixth season.  Overall, for superb packaging and a great price, I rate the ""I Love Lucy: The Complete Sixth Season"" DVD box set with an anticipatory 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it!  Hopefully the 13 hour-long ""The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show"" episodes from 1957 to 1960 will follow in another DVD box set.",1139702400,252,6675,4.7136715391229576

This four disc set contains all of the episodes from that season including the lost Christmas episode. Each DVD is packed with extras including flubs, outtakes and old commercials used to promote the show. Kudos to Paramount for all of the extras!",1138924800,105,4672,4.710947109471094
1830600,2,B00008972D,"Season One of I Love Lucy has finally made it to a complete box set however, what is up with the price?  I just purchased Season Two and Three and paid less for the two combined than what Season One costs.  $82.00 for a new set ($74.00 for a ""like new"" set) is way to much considering that Season One was the weakest season of all.  You would think that the Studio Heads would want to sell Season One at a more affordable price just to get them off the shelves.  I even went as far as adding up all of the individual DVD's, volume by volume of Season One and, if you buy them used, you still come out cheaper than buying the complete set.  Therefore, considering that most of the episodes of Season One were not my favorite, I just brought a few of the individual volumes that had some good episodes and left it at that.",1106870400,,820,4.132075471698113
1830601,5,B00008972D,"The second half of season one was certainly stronger, as these four episodes demonstrate.
Unfortunately, this disc starts with a weak episode.  ""The Young Fans"" finds both Ricky and Lucy with crushes from young neighbors.  Fred and Ethel are completely missing (a common complaint of mine early on) and I find the ending unbelievable.  Fortunately, the other three episodes are much better.
""New Neighbors"" finds Lucy thinking he's over heard a plot to kill her and Ricky when she spies on the new tenants.  This episode is hysterical, especially for Lucy's impersonation of a chair.
When ""Fred and Ethel Fight,"" Lucy and Ricky get caught in the middle.  And after the Mertzes have made up, it's the Ricardos who aren't speaking to each other.
Lastly, ""The Moustache"" finds Lucy trying to get Ricky to shave only to wind up with a beard herself.  This episode features some truly funny facial expressions from a frustrated Lucy.
This DVD is a collector's dream.  The episodes are presented in their entirety, and they look and sound sharp.  There are occasional flaws in the picture, but considering the source material is 50 years old, it really isn't bad at all.  The sound is presented in mono.  While it won't challenge your sound system, it serves the purpose well and is faithful to the original audio recording.  The extras this time around feature two original openings since they changed starting with ""New Neighbors.""  Also included are the now familiar guest cast info, trivia, mistakes, and episode of ""My Favorite Husband.""
While not an ideal way to be released, it's wonderful to have these shows on DVD.  I can't get enough Lucy, and this disc will be played many times at my house.",1084924800,,1697,4.871080139372823
1830602,1,B00008972D,I agree with the comments made by Brian B.  I Love Lucy should be available in box sets like all the other series.  I love the show but I am very unhappy that they are not available in box sets.,1060732800,,194,3.825
1830603,1,B00008972D,"I am just about fed up and at my wits end with Studios releasing these partial ""sets"".  You know, you've seen several studios doing it:  putting 4 or 5 helter-skelter episodes from a particular year or years on a DVD rather than boxing the entire season in chronological order.  To say that they nickle and dime you to death by these underhanded practices wouldn't be so bad if indeed we were talking about ""nickles and dimes"", however, we are talking about major tens, twenties, fifties, and hundreds of dollars to fully complete these series.  The unabashed greed of the Studios, represented by putting a measley four episodes per DVD is appalling.  I Love Lucy is certainly not the first and only show that is doing this, but that hardly makes it any more palletable.  Speaking for myself, but with certainly many, many more movie and TV buffs like myself sharing this opinion, I refuse to be lurred in to buying these partial sets any more, only to discover months later that the studio has put out the individual full seasons in chronological order.  Listen, I'm not going to say that series' such as M*A*S*H, Cheers, Frazier, All in the Family, and The Simpsons are any better than I Love Lucy, but they are brilliant in their own right, and they all put out full-season box sets and I have every one of them, just as I would have I Love Lucy if they were available, but I cannot allow myself to be ripped off any more.  So if any of you Studio ""heads"" (and I'm being kind in not using a more appropriate body part here) are listening - you will get zilch from me from this point forward until you live the words of Spike Lee and ""Do the Right Thing"".  Just remember, a Rolls-Royce costs two or three hundred thousand dollars per copy, and they sell a few dozen every year, whereas Ford sells millions of reasonably-priced vehicles every year.  Now it just happens to be a fact that Ford owns Rolls-Royce and not the reverse.  There is a lesson for the greedy here, but whether they are astute enough to read it is another question:  RELEASE FULL-SEASON BOX SETS!!!  Get it???",1056412800,11,2082,4.53475935828877
