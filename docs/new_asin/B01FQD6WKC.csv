I ordered the Series and the Director's Cut Movie on BluRay (And a bit pricey too). First off I made the mistake of watching the Movie First when it should have been last so be forewarned, watch the episodes FIRST them the Movie. Ok, this takes place 17 years from the beginning in 2013 and of SV2 only Division  2 is still operating in a sense. Episode:0 is told by the seemingly, only remaining original member SHIGE, who has risen to Maintenance Chief who fills in the details of what happened to the original characters and the difficulty in keeping the Labors running due to age and lack of parts. A GREAT lead-in to the 12 other episodes which follow and the Movie . First off, don't expect to see the Labors in action every episode as the years of wear and tear and lack of parts have taken their toll but when they DO !!!! Storylines...............can't say too much but we will re-visit some old locations, re-open some old wounds, and as the series builds a darkness begins to roll in as well as a shake-up at the Top with a New Minister that takes a GREAT interest in SV2 that gets everyone shaking in their boots. The Cast: as with the Live Action Yamato Movie, they made a great effort to make the cast look like their anime' counterparts. These may be NEW officers but you will recognize everyone ( and their ""NEW"" names are a dead give-away). The Anime' cartoon humor is gone and in its place some sit-com slapstick which really works. With the Live Action aspect you also get moments where you get to think a bit and even shed a tear. I played mine on a BluRay Player and the up-conversion on the Series DVD made it almost BluRay quality and made the cinematography jump out at you. The ONLY,YES, ONLY downside is that the English subtitles are a bit of a mess but if you've been watching Anime' long enough you'll get the drift. The Title and End Title sequences are excellent including an update on the Patlabor Voice Over Introduction and end features scene captures from the episode. The Movie....... as with the Anime' Movies had a darker harder look than the episodes. A nice touch was some of the soundtrack music from a particular scene in the Anime' accompanying the Live Action representation that sent chills down the spine and an instant recall of the scene and mood. About 3/4 of the way through the series a plot twist starts that doesn't resolve itself until the climax of the Movie and you will smile.
 So if you love Patlabor Anime'.............................you'd better get ready for a new ride !!",1469836800,3,2674,4.509278350515464
