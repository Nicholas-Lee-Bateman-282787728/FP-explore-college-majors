5690743,2,B00C57W9GY,"The good: the acting is a tad better than I thought it would be. Not a whole lot, but still...  I don't know if I've ever seen Joe Estevez before but immediately recognized him as a relative of Martin Sheen.

The bad: some of the worst special effects I've seen in a long time. Inexcusable for a movie made in 2013.

A sad story about an outcast turned killer giant Mountain man with a little bit of crazy thrown in.  Kids from a work program who look way older than teenagers (I swear on of 'em had to be at least 30 yrs old) are taken to the woods and almost immediately run afoul of the KillerGiantMountainMan whose loss of his - no, I'm not kidding - big blue horribly done special effect ox was shot and roasted by mean ol' loggers has driven him crazier. That last sentence really got out of hand but does describe the movie perfectly.

Good for a bad movie party, I guess, but not a whole lot more.  Some language, lots of gore, no sex.",1376524800,,943,4.18232044198895
5690744,3,B00C57W9GY,"Axe Giant: The Wrath of Paul Bunyan
90 min
Fantasy/Horror
June 18, 2013
Director: Gary Jones
Writers: Jeffrey Miller - screenplay, Gary Jones - screenplay
Stars: Joe Estevez, Dan Haggerty, and Thomas Downey

Paul Bunyan? Not unless he fell into a toxic dump, was lobotomized in a sawmill, and never had anger management.  He's ugly, big, and always mad as he slices and dices with his giant axe making julienne people parts.  Seriously to take out Dan ""Grizzly Adams"" Haggerty right off was sacrilege.  He should have gotten in a few good licks of his own on this Mutilated Bunyan and sicked his bear on him too.  Nothing exceptional about this movie.  Pretty much a typical B  Horror/SciFi.  I wasn't particularly drawn to the creature or the people trying to escape it.  All-in-all a ho hum movie that I watched because Cable is pretty much a wasteland and has me wondering why I have to pay for it and still watch commercials.

5690745,3,B00C57W9GY,"Sgt. Hoke(Thomas Downey) is in charge a group of first time teen offenders at a camp in the woods of Minnesota. The hormonal teens camp outside. One of them in the group earns the wrath of a giant (about 15 to 40 feet depending on need) who attacks them. This is a fairly straight forward teen slasher film with the slasher being slightly different.

The special effects were bad. The CG Babe the Blue Ox was comical. The 1890's clothes looked modern. People chopped in half, blood spray. They attempted to create diverse personalities, but it fell flat as the acting fell short.

Parental Guide: F-bombs, near sex, nudity (Jill Evyn) There are worse Red Box rentals.",1373500800,3,667,4.6923076923076925
5690746,2,B00C57W9GY,"It's not the worst movie, but of course it's not the best B-movie either. It is not too boring and too exciting. You can clearly see very bad special effects, but the acting was all right. To B-movie junkies this can be an all right to watch movie, however I can't say how many people would give this movie a second try. To me the movie was all right, as I already knew what to expect of it. This movie offered something new, giants, and even though it was badly made and the CGI sucked none the less, it was okay. I've seen worse movies. Hard to say whether you should give it a try or not. If you expect a very good B-movie, it's not one of them. This is more of a B- or a C/C- movie. Maybe if special effects were better, then the movie could be much better. The nude scene was nothing more than pathetic. Actors were all right, but I didn't care about any of them and neither did I care if the giant would eat their heads or step on them or kill them in any other ways. The sounds of gun shots and gun reloads was clearly stolen from other movies. ''...and then the ugly killer grew  bigger and bigger and bigger ''- but could you tell the watchers, how or why did he grow? No, apparently not. What I found really sad in the movie is when the animal got shot and the giant met his demise. There is gore in the movie and plenty of it, but it's cheaper than cheap. Just like those breasts you'll see.. ewww. It's not just breasts, the whole body was 'eewww'. The story is not surprising in any way and different parts of the whole plot was taken from different sources and then put together. Nothing surprising in this movie. Many if not everything in the movie is predictable.",1373155200,2,1679,4.166153846153846
5690747,5,B00C57W9GY,"This movie is not from what u heard in folklore, it does speak of babe, the blue ox. but very little of that. it goes back to the pre dark ages. a monster lookin type of guy of normal height is put in a cave which is blown up to be sealed forever. before he is put in the cave he looks one more time at his love female type. not the ox. years went bye and he grew and grew till 15ft in height then he escapes the cave. their is a group of people from prison doing clean up detail in the woods. well they come upon the giant and run to a cabin. first the giant splits a girl in half with his axe head to toe. then he breaks down the roof of the cabin and picks up one girl by one leg upside down shaking her quite a bit up and down thinking it is his long lost melanie. their is a girl their who looks like melanie (double part) they all run from the cabin but before the giant can get melanie he is shot first with a tranquil dart, more than one. then later in the movie he is killed by many firing on him. but they show him falling off of a large bridge into water. i have a feeling there will be a axe giant 2.",1372896000,4,1112,3.7361702127659573
5690748,4,B00C57W9GY,"I was raised on American folk lore, so this was pretty much obligatory to watch. It actually has decent production values. This film reminds me of a cross between an Asylum (Sci-Fi) picture and Hatchet (if you haven't seen Hatchet, go watch it!). I had fun watching it and would recommend it to anyone who likes semi-gory horror tales with a comedic (but not stupid comedic) tone. The actors work well with each other and it looks like they had a good time filming this. I would recommend watching this if you are even slightly interested; it is far, far, above 80% of the horror movies and it is not one of those filmed with a $3 budget that look like a messy, VCR quality picture.",1372809600,2,682,4.420634920634921

5690762,5,B00C57W9GY,"Axe Giant is perhaps one of the most amusing pieces of film I've seen lately. I was instantly hooked. Here are some highlights.

Watch for when the woman pours water into another bucket. She smells the ""aroma"" and announces how wonderful the stew is or some such thing to the beaming BBQ pitmaster nearby, who is tending the logging camp's dinner, which is essentially a giant cow on a spit.

Just look at that beef for a moment. The flank is ludicrous, it would seem right at home in the parking lot or on the roof of a steakhouse.

Now notice the complete lack of fire anywhere nearby. Under the beef are snow covered rocks. Oh, and that pot of water we're supposed to think is stew.

Later, you'll get to meet the man with the ax. He takes good care of his ax. You got to respect that. And he can teleport to appear in front of fleeing cars. Oh, and he also has a ballad, of a sort, at the end of the film. I dare you to listen to it.

That's just a small taste of what Axe Giant has to offer. But you be the judge, and watch it. Then you'll know why some say Axe Giant changed their lives. .",1494633600,2,1095,4.074418604651163

5690770,4,B00C57W9GY,"Minnesota 1884: Foreman Bill (a cameo by Dan Haggerty) and his lumberjack crew have just called it a day and are ready for dinner, where Elmer the Cook (Alan Tuskes) is roasting a huge ox over a fire pit. Bill needs to take a dump before he eats, so he leaves for the forest without his axe. When he returns, he finds his entire crew and the other hired crew have been slaughtered, their heads and other body parts bloodily dismembered. A slightly tall man with a monstrous face appears and chases Bill into the log-sawing shack. Bill first loses an arm from the large round spinning blade and then he gets cut in half through the middle of his skull. Cut to the present at the Minnesota Department of Corrections, where Ms. K (Kristina Kopf) and the gruff Sgt. Hoke (Tom Downey) are running the ""First Offender Program"", where teens and young adults like Marty (Clifton Williams), Rosa (Victoria Ramos), Trish (Jill Evyn), Zack (Jesse Kove) and CB Tanner (Amber Thomas), the father of Sheriff Tanner (Tim Lovelace), have to survive a week in the Minnesota forest and they will have their records wiped clean if they stay out of trouble for six months. The trouble is CB is only semi-guilty, since she got behind the wheel of her car slightly buzzed (""Buzzed driving is drunk driving"" is what those commercials say over and over) and a man ran a red light and smacked into her car. A man with influence with three arrests for DWI who used his power to blame CB and made her attorney take a plea deal. Daddy was powerless to do anything, because he was overruled at the State level. So she took the plea deal and is now in this program. People will thank her for that. Once everyone is in the forest (where Sgt. Hoke treats them like they are in the the military while he enjoys fine cigars and booze in his cabin), everyone meets Meeks (Joe Estevez, who can do this kind of role blindfolded), who tells them that there is death waiting for them the deeper they go into the forest, but Sgt. Hoke tells everyone he is crazy. Not as crazy as Sgt. Hoke thinks. On one of their grueling hikes, the giant Paul Bunyan (Chris Hahn, who is rendered in CGI, forced perspective and miniature sets) appears behind Trish and uses his trusty giant axe to split her in half vertically and the cuts Sgt. Hoke in half through his stomach, stepping Sgt. Hoke's upper torso when he won't shut up about killing him (both deaths are highly graphic). Rosa is injured by a giant flying branch, so everyone still left alive holes-up in a cabin, while Paul Bunyan drags their van away (""There goes our only ride, man!""). Meeks joins the group and tells them the real story about Paul Bunyan. When he was born, he was unusually large and doctors gave him a slim chance to live. His face was especially deformed from the delivery. Meeks tells the group that Bunyan is so angry because Zack stole one of Babe The Blue Ox's horns and he wants it back. If they place it at the shrine he created for his only one true friend, Paul Bunyon will probably leave them alone. Zack goes outside and throws the horn into the woods, screaming that the giant can leave them alone now, but the horn comes flying back and impales Zack through his stomach and Paul Bunyan drags Zack away screaming. Meeks continues his story of Paul Bunyan (""He's twice a big as the normal man and lives three times as long!"") and we see in flashback Foreman Bill kill Babe and then hand him over to Elmer the Cook to make dinner out of. Paul Bunyan (who is already six foot high and just a teenager of 13) is enraged and goes on a murder spree (we get to see him cut heads and appendages off where we only saw the aftermath in the beginning of the film, thanks to Robert Kurtzman's Creature Corps), ending in Foreman Bill's death. The people in town capture him and drag him through town (the two men who drag him are Robert Kurtzman and director Gary Jones), where people spit on him and the girl he was sweet on, Mel (Donna Williams), turns her back on him (She could overlook his ugliness, but not murder). He is thrown into a mine shaft and the entrance sealed with dynamite. Bunyan eventually escaped and headed for the high country, where he built a shrine to Babe and grew and grew and grew. He really never bothered anyone (We watch him kill a bear in the beginning of the film when the bear goes to kill a deer, so he lives off the land) and has kept to himself, but the desecration of Babe's shrine by Zack has turned him into a wild man once again. Ms. K and the rest of the kids are still in big trouble from Paul Bunyan's vengeance. Can Sheriff Tanner save them in time? CB is in the most danger because she is the spitting image of Paul's old flame Mel and Bunyan attacks the cabin, using his axe to chop a hole into the cabin's roof. He grabs Rosa, but when he gets a good look at her and sees it is not CB, Bunyan throws her through the air like a ragdoll, where she hits a tree and dies. Ms. K uses Sgt. Hoke's pistol and shoots Bunyan in the eye and Sheriff Tanner shows up, puts a few rifle shots into Bunyan and he falls back into the shack (a very good use of miniature sets and forced perspective). Meeks, carrying a shotgun, refuses to let anyone leave, because he does not want the town to know that Paul Bunyan is real. Marty goes to grab the shotgun away from Meeks and gets shot in the chest and dies. I guess Paul Bunyan doesn't feel the same way about Meeks, because he throws the giant axe and decapitates him (another very well done scene, where Meek's rolling head ends up in front of the camera). The last three remaining survivors jump into Sheriff Tanner's truck, where CB drives while her father shoots at Paul Bunyan. who is chasing the truck. CB eventually crashes the truck (Was she buzzed?), so the three head for a small bridge with Bunyan not far behind. The door to the other side of the bridge is locked and gunfire won't open it, but a posse who heard the Sheriff's call for help earlier in the film show up and put a whole lot of gunfire into Bunyan's body (pretty good scene). Before Bunyan dies, he looks at CB and says ""Mel! Mel!"" and falls off the bridge to the river below. All we see is one huge blood puddle. Is this the end of Paul Bunyan (it isn't if you read the final words in the end credits)? The posse carry Paul Bunyon's giant axe away as proof and Sheriff Tanner, CB and Ms. K have a story to tell for generations to come. And remember: ""No critters were harmed in the making of this film.""  This film made its debut on the SyFy Network, but in severely edited form. There are scenes of topless female nudity, foul language and plenty of bloody gore that even regular cable wouldn't allow. Director/co-screenwriter (with Jeff Miller)/co-producer (also with Miller)/visual effects editor Gary Jones (MOSQUITO - 1995  [Jones and the late star Gunnar Hansen built up a professional and personal friendship]; SPIDERS - 2000 [a real guilty pleasure, even though the acting sucks]; CROCODILE 2: DEATH SWAMP - 2002 [must hold some type of record for saying the word ""f***""]; JOLLY ROGER: MASSACRE AT CUTTER'S COVE - 2005 [one of The Asylum's few non-mockumentaries]; BOOGEYMAN 3 - 2008 [the best of the franchise]; and many others) manages to keep the CGI at a minimum (Once you see Babe The Blue Ox in CGI, you'll be thankful, believe me!) and relies more on physical effects (although some are ""goosed"" with CGI), which makes a world of difference in the enjoyment of this film. Robert Kurtzman's gory effects are very well done (he makes a better effects man than a director, as you can see in BURIED ALIVE [2006], THE RAGE [2007] and DEADLY IMPACT [2010], although I will give him his well-deserved props for WISHMASTER [1997]). This is no great shakes as a horror film, but it is a nice little time-waster with some welcome gore, minimal CGI and nudity if you watch it in its unedited form. Not your typical SyFy film. Besides, who doesn't want to see Grizzly Adams bite the big one in such a bloody way? It's worth it just for that alone. Also starring Bud Moffett, Daniel Alan Kiely, John Schneider (no, not that one), Tom Luhtala and Jeremy Price. A Virgil Films & Entertainment DVD Release. Rated R.",1449360000,,8203,4.42819324950364
5690771,4,B00C57W9GY,"Now this is a b-movie done right. And make no mistake, everyone involved from the director to the cast and crew knew what kind of movie they were making and decided to run with it. The result is a film that is incredibly fun for those of us who like monster movies. Sure, it follows the familiar formula--a group of young adults are stranded out in the woods while a monster stalks them and dispenses bloody death with an axe--but it's the execution that always makes the difference. The script isn't particularly original but it is clever, the actors seem to all be having a blast playing their roles, and the monster is really pretty neat. I mean, it's Paul Bunyan, for crying out loud! Look, this is genre filmmaking, with all that implies. Axe Giant could be a Syfy original in a lot of ways, though it's generally much better crafted than your typical Syfy flick. It's all extremely rough around the edges, but that never detracts from the fun factor. The acting is good enough from everyone involved, the kills are terrific, and the giant, ogre-like monster is a welcome deviation from masked sociopaths and zombies. The woods in which all the mayhem goes down are a great setting for a tale of bloody murder, and the cinematography puts a lot of great scenes together. Finally, the plot rolls to a satisfying climax that has an actual conclusion, unlike many other genre efforts that close with the obligatory, and usually quite stupid, lead-in to a sequel. If you don't like b-movies, then you won't like Axe Giant. But if you do, then you'll love this one. And you'll never think of the legend of Paul Bunyan in quite the same way again!",1438041600,,1646,4.6020408163265305
5690772,4,B00C57W9GY,"I first saw this on television and just knew I had to have it.  What magnificent crap.  The CGI is bargain basement tacky, more cartoon than live action.  The characters are all standard, as if picked out of a catalog by the director (I'll need one of these, four of those, a couple of them).  The story is daffy, beginning in the long distant past when the Bunyan was a pintsized axe murderer.  He took exception to the starving loggers chowing down on his pussy-footin' ox and slaughtered the lot of them, something the townsfolk didn't appreciate.  They tried blowing him up but he only got bigger and older, a lot older, and meaner.  And then when some dopey kid disrespected poor, long-dead Babe's horn, that was the last straw.  Nothing would do but he had to kill them all with extreme prejudice.  Those he could catch, that is.

This movie is hilariously awful.  A classic of clichs, riddled with crazy dialog, and bad (really bad) acting.  In fact, the worst actor of the bunch actually says that at one point.  ""This is very-very-very-bad!""  At first, I thought he was talking about himself, then I guessed he meant Bunyan on a killing spree.

This movie is mesmerizing; from the first frame to the closing credits, that issues this warning: Bunyan will return.  Oh good, a sequel.  (What idiot would be willing to pay for that?)",1429488000,3,1339,4.629787234042553

You could shoot a better video drunk in the dark with an old VHS recorder. And that's probably how they did it.",1380672000,4,404,4.4

8577372,1,B00C57W9GY,"Pretty much what you are expecting. Big ugly giant, kind of wrapped around the Paul Bunyan legend. But this Bunyan was hydrocephalic and his head got bigger and he got dumber. The ""real"" Paul Bunyan was literate and could read and write and speak, this one couldn't even talk except for the name of his gal, which he remembered for 130 years. Perhaps I was mistaken, but was he  playing chess with Meeks?. He has been roaming the woods for over one hundred years in Minnesota but was never seen until some punk stole his Ox's horn, or a chunk of it anyway. That got him quite upset. Temper, temper. Looks like he could have used that knuckleheaded social worker. How did he make that fine ax (or axe)?",1530748800,,701,4.434108527131783
8577373,3,B00C57W9GY,"Is it a good movie? No.

Is it enjoyable for what it is? More or less.

The film itself is poorly made. The CGI is horrible and looks right out of a Syfy original. So much so, in fact, that I would not be surprised to learn this movie is one. And when a large part of your movie's appeal is the monster, having a monster that looks as fake as possible is putting your worst foot forward. I also need to take a moment here to especially single out the filmmaker's ridiculous attempts to render Bunyan's POV shots. They're completely disorienting, and unnecessarily so.

The funny thing, though, is that they seem to switch between CGI shots of Bunyan when he's in the forest and practical shots of an actor in prosthetics. And the prosthetics are actually pretty good. It's a shame they could not have either found a more practical way to render their eponymous giant or, at least, afford better CGI.

On top of the fake looking monster, you have bad acting and a by-the-numbers film. There's nothing particularly new here. And everything you see has surely been done better. Look elsewhere if you want good effects, solid acting, or something fresh for the monster genre.

And yet, judging this film based on its objective merits feels like the wrong way to go here. As I said above, ""Axe Giant"" is not a good movie. But it is a decent way to burn 90 minutes. It's enjoyable, but you have to appreciate the movie for what it is: a low-budget production as befitting a B-rate, made for television, genre film. And if you go in with those qualifiers in mind, the film mostly works.

So, if you like Syfy originals, you'll probably enjoy ""Axe Giant."" If you want movies driven by strong special effects and solid acting, you won't.",1526515200,,1728,4.522435897435898

Typical modern horror movie plot with a lot of almost mindless running around while being chased by the ugliest and craziest version of Paul Bunyan that I have ever seen.  Though he is not a lot uglier than the folks in the town through which he was dragged.  Unfortunately, I can't say that this is the worst movie of its type which I have seen.  There are a lot worse ones out there.  I streamed this thing via Amazon Prime.",1506988800,,565,4.333333333333333
