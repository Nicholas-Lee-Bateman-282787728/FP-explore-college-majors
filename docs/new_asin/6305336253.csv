1010820,4,6305336253,"Beware if you are looking for a decent sci-fi movie to satisfy your celestial loincloth of a meaningful film, but if you liked ""Ice Pirates"" from the 80's, and enjoy Star Trek (any new series), there's a chance you will find yourself strangely thinking about it later and recalling a funny scene. The pigs shaped liked boxes were the highlight for me.",973468800,2,351,4.67741935483871
1010821,5,6305336253,"People who pan this movie just don't get it. It's a parody in the tradition of Dark Star. Terrific cast, good script with a great ending.  Special effects were outstanding considering they didn't have a Star Wars  budget--the design of the truck was inspired. If you don't find the concept  of ""square pigs"" (actually rectangular prisms) to save space  funny, scratch comedy from your list; you're just not built for it. Part of  the humor was that it apparently hadn't occurred to them to transport  processed pork instead of live pigs. It reminds me of the great Bob and Ray  routine where the cranberry grower hadn't thought of making cranberry  juice. This is a well done put-on that's just fun to watch.",966124800,10,708,4.745901639344262
1010822,3,6305336253,"I have never been let down by a movie of his in the past...OK, Castle  Freak wasn't quite as good as I thought it would be, but I had high  expectations. I had mediocre expectations with this but what a let down.  I'm tired so I'll just list off what I thought was bad and what I liked (to  be nice to Mr. Gordon, who is still one of my favorite directors, I'll put  the good stuff last) What didn't work--1. No chemistry between any of the  leads, even those that were supposed to be attracted to each other 2. The  plot really wasn't so hot, it seemed made as it went along, and elements  were brought in that didn't go anywhere 3. not especially original except  for a few things which I'll get to 4. Jeffrey Combs never showed up-they  could have worked him in a cameo *somewhere* for crying out loud 5. lame  monsters, who really weren't threatening or scary 6. little or no gore, to  the point where it was unrealistic. George Wendt sucked out of a window,  without even bleeding? I guess Alien Resurrection was a hard act to follow,  but come on. 7. a pretty bad script that maybe could have been salvageable  with better acting, effects, and...well, it could have used a few  re-writes. 8. the ship itself--the harness did look like it was from a  roller-coaster, and there was one shot where it was so painfully obvious  the ship was a miniature that it looked like something from a B-movie  (though I could have forgiven the B-movie stuff if the rest of the movie  was entertaining) Now the stuff that did work-1. Debi Mazar is always fun  to watch, though her character was kind of weak and could have had better  clothes 2. Dennis Hopper at least tried, and made the character amusing and  likeable 3. The genetically engineered square pigs-actually, that was the  best part of the movie, and I got all excited when they showed up early on,  I figured I was in for a treat, but there was just that one spurt of  originality and it went downhill from there 4. Barbara Crampton showing up  5. the evil pirate captain having to kick-start his private parts 6. the  country music used--bet you never heard that in a sci-fi flick before. 7.  the two themes/genres of sci-fi and trucker/road movies blended together  was a cool idea. I give it 4 out of 10 stars. Not bad, but not good either.",961113600,,2298,4.41527446300716
1010823,5,6305336253,"If you've seen ""From Beyond"", ""Re-Animator"", ""Fortress"", or ""Castle Freak"", then you are familiar with Stuart Gordan's work. He starts with a small budget, then makes a  special effects extravaganza. He is also very careful to keep the story top  notch. This is his masterpiece! It's presented in the spirit of ""Ice  Pirates"", but is far superior. Top quality effects, talent, story and  dialogue, art and production design make this a strong contender for the  top space movies. I hate space movies that take themselves too seriously  and forget to have fun. This a very obnoxious trait in B-movies. They are  standing there in a trash can with a walky talky duct taped to their face  with a deadly serious look on their face! Puuuhleeeeeaze! ""Space  Truckers"" finds just the right tone and runs with it. Special features  include a commentary by Stuart himself. Usually commentary tracks just with  the director can be boring, but Stu was so integrally involved in the  smallest detail of this film that he is constantly belting out info about  the film. The documentary is cool and informative as well. This trivia game  thing is catching on. If you screw up the answer, just hit your  ""menu"" button while the clip plays to try that question again.  When you pass the quiz, you are admitted to the production art section,  where you can see concept designs by the famous Ron Cobb (Star Wars, Alien)  and others.

Another shot out of the 70's as they were experimenting with square tomatoes back then.  I think there are a lot more inside jokes than I got.  My only real complaint is Debi Mazer's costume.

It's about the trials and tribulations of a spacegoing truckdriver. Hauling a doomsday cargo of robotic invaders back to Earth, trying to make a buck, and lookin' for love, Hopper has a lot going on... like this movie. This isn't classic sci-fi, but it's an amusement that I can watch every now and then. Look for the scene where the truck gets hot and Debbie Mazar just has to get out of that stifling space suit. Throw in square pigs, space pirates, and a cameo by George Wendt...how much more can you ask for?",1390435200,,687,4.4603174603174605
1011088,4,6305336253,"I had always heard Space Truckers was one of director Stuart Gordon's weakest films.  I am glad to conclude this is far from the case.  I was stunned that this was a $25 million dollar film (in 90's dollars) making this AFAIK his most expensive film to date (hopefully not his last).

The special fx really shine, though a few small plotholes do emerge (I won't spoil them for you).  Do yourself a favor and buy this movie today.

Be warned though that like some older DVD's this is presented in widescreen, but a widescreen made for older 4:3 TV's.  You'll need to use the zoom in feature on your hdtv.  I thought this would make it look like garbage, but I didn't notice any loss in visual fidelity.

Highly recommended.",1389225600,,722,4.458015267175573
1011089,5,6305336253,"Honestly... this is one of those really rare, genuinely ""feel good"" movies that just happens to take place in Space, not unlike Star Wars. You don't have to really be a fan of Sci-Fi to enjoy this movie, but also not unlike Star Wars - the setting and the believability requires that you can suspend your disbelief and absorb the atmosphere as well. Some of you may cry foul at the comparison, but once you really ""get"" Space Truckers and it's appeal... you can easily make the distinction. Light hearted fantasy, funny, whimisical, and really inspired moments that deliberately take themselves not so serious to drive it home is what makes it so easy to recommend. Similar to the way the bar in Star Wars had a very grimy look to it, or how it's commonplace to buy used robots from a travelling Jawa pawnshop on wheels - Space Truckers effectivelt captures moments like this, that will give you pause and chuckle... and say in the back of your mind ""in this universe I suppose that makes sense. Again, Space Truckers more than anything else that could be said for it... accurately captures that ""it's the future, but everyone here in the future LIVES here so they're not suprised by it... they just live their lives in it"". It's just a great little story (if somewhat campy) with just enough quirkiness and heart to really imbed itself. It's also really fun to watch again and catch all the little things you may have missed the first time (like the space billboards - with funny and quirky ads - rubiks cuban quisine ""your meal is free if you throw up"" - etc) I don't give a 5 star rating easily to movies but this little gem of a movie featuring the late Dennis Hopper, totally warrants it. The reason it works so well is that you almost get a sense that this could actually be the way the future would look. From the overly bright pink probationary ""company"" overalls, to the way the sets are designed to not have a futuristic ultra shiny look, but instead a grubby, grimy ""this is a truckstop in space"" look and feel - and most importantly... the way the actors sell it. If any one of them had a ""I can't believe I'm doing this"" or ""there goes my oscar"" look on their faces, it would have detracted from this fine work. Trust me... it's just something you've gotta see. When my friend in Navy bootcamp way back in the day was obsessing over this movie... literally obsessing and kept wanting to see it again and again - I wondered why. Finally I took him up on it and checked it out at the on post theater. Was I EVER suprised... it soon became one of my all time favorites. It's campy fun but not in an overly (roll your eyes) campy way... just enough to get a laugh. It's really clever, quite funny (there's a part where one of the baddies gets shot and you can see smoke coming out of his chest wound and with a delightfully blissful and delirious look says ""smells like somebody's cookin' hamburgers"" to which his rather idiotic buddy says ""no that's just you"" and his friend dies - it's more funny to see it than explain it). But truly... if you're looking for something a little different... and highly addictive in the ""cult classic"" category... the Space Truckers is your movie.... Now if you'll excuse me, ""you're upsetting my pigs""...",1389052800,,3249,4.489864864864865

 Dennis Hopper is at his usual best in this adventure of trucking in space. The way truckers are portrayed in this film is as true as it gets. NOT like they are in most ""trucking"" movies in the last 20 years, including 'Smokey and the Bandit'
 If you are, or know a truck driver, you and he/she will enjoy this movie. You will recognize the typical problems encountered by all drivers, especially owner/operators.
 An honest driver trying to make an honest living in a treacherous business, gets help (admittedly UNasked for) from two unlikely companions. With a little bit of luck, and some ingenuity, they prevail against the bad guys, and all UNINTENTIONALLY become a team.
  It's done in widescreen so you get to see all the action. The special effects are actually better than Classic Star Trek. I know, by today's standards, that's not saying much, but believe me, you won't notice. Buy this movie. You'll like it.

No, no way. Had he instead gone for the Ed Wood model, I suspect he would've found a bit more success. But even that takes a certain kind of subtle intelligence and self-awareness, itself very rare commodities nowadays.

Ludicrous productions like 'Space Truckers' should be the diecast mold for such specific talent.

Playing a pair of long haul transporters - Dennis Hopper and Stephen Dorff.

Hopper's character, John Canyon, is an independent contractor in a world full of company lackeys. Prideful with little social grace, he doesn't care about anything other than himself and his next paycheck. With one exception. He has the sincere hots for the space station waitress in the form of hypnotic Debi Mazar.

When his latest haul is disputed and the company decides that they aren't going to pay him, Canyon is stuck. And worse, he can't get his wannabe girlfriend back home to her dying mother. Pissed that he's broke and without anybody special in his life, he makes a fateful decision. He's going to do an off-the-books haul. Reaching out to the underground contractors, he accepts an assignment despite knowing that the transport is completely illegal.

Forced to take on a greenhorn driver in the form of Stephen Dorff, the trio look to make their bones on this one single run.

The job: Haul a special cargo bound for Earth. What the guys don't know is that this trip is more than just running afoul of the law with illegal sex dolls or contraband drugs - what they unknowingly carry represents the death knell to the current global government. Inside the freight is an army of preprogrammed electronic battle bots, warriors of a worldwide coup de'tat.

But before they even have a chance to realize their mistake, the whole shebang is intercepted by pirates.

As the thieves open the containers to see what booty they've gotten, all hell breaks loose as the robotic army begins to activate and carry out their mission, irrespective of the fact that they aren't on terra firma. A co-mingling of a Terminator and Geiger alien - the bots begin to kill everyone in sight.

Can the unlikely trio wrangle their way out to freedom and Earth?

Typical B-movie for the period, which plays well when paired with some liquid brain bleach and a bag of microwave popcorn.

1011188,4,6305336253,"Space Truckers is one of those films that promises so little that it really can't disappoint. I mean the name of the movie is friggin' Space Truckers.  However, when all is said and done the story contains humor, pirates, adventure, greed, sex and space violence (always good). It is an incredibly original and unique story in its done-to-death genre. While the film's not about to win any awards forrrr, uh...anything, it will have you laughing and rooting for Dennis Hopper the whole time. Granted sometimes you're laughing with the movie and sometimes at it but the point is you're laughing. If you like ""bad"" sci-fi movies this is one of the best. Give it a shot if you're into these types of flicks. On a serious note the cast contains a few famous faces (George ""the fat guy from Cheers"" Wendt, Debi Mazaar, Dorff and Dennis Hopper) and overall the acting is pretty good.",1259625600,,877,4.694805194805195
1011189,4,6305336253,"To begin, let me just clarify by saying that I consider myself a true science fiction buff: Whether it be novels, films, or long-standing franchises such as Star Trek or Star Wars.  That said, I believe this film's less-than-stellar rating has a lot to do with expectations going into the viewing.  I suppose it's fortunate that I went in with expectations through the basement floor and as such came away quite impressed with the quaint charm Stuart Gordon was able to inject into this project.

Released in a time when science fiction properties weren't exactly the hot topic (after all, Dennis Hopper had signed on board directly after having concluded work on Costner's disastrous Waterworld), Space Truckers uses humor to break up the drudgery of life on the road (or space lane as the case may be).  Truthfully, this should probably be expected considering former National Lampoon editor Ted Mann scripted the picture.  With a budget of $25 million (in early 1990's dollars) the entire project was filmed at Ireland's Ardmore Studios and then shown at several 1997 film festivals (Sundance, Sitges, Vancouver) where it was well received.

The story takes place in the year 2196 and follows the exploits of freight pilot John Canyon (Dennis Hopper), one of few remaining independent space truckers competing against huge corporations. It begins with Canyon's (late) attempt to deliver a cargo of living pigs, which just so happen to be genetically engineered square and stackable for more efficient shipping in cargo containers, when he discovers that his profits are severely decreased when labor boss (George Wendt) is anything but happy about the latesness of his arrival.

This leads to Canyon rebelling against the system by accepting a questionable cargo that pays some five-times the normal rate.  The catch?  Don't ask, don't tell on exactly what's in the cargo containers in tow.  Canyon then heads for Earth accompanied by young apprentice trucker Mike Pucci (Stephen Dorff) and slutty waitress Cindy (Debi Mazar), who agrees to marry Canyon if he can get her safely to the blue planet to visit with her sickly mother.

The real good stuff begins when pirates capture Canyon's antiquated truck (the Pachyderm 2000) and the cargo he's transporting once Canyon turns off the patrolled space shipping lanes in favor of the risky ""Scum Zone"".  Their ship is high jacked by pirates led by disfigured cyborg, Macanudo (played by Charles Dance).

What it all comes down to is 97 minutes of light-hearted but unique science fiction with some witty dialog to pull laughs (over slap stick, thankfully).  The show's kitschy charm could perhaps best be compared to another science fiction entry of the era, The Fifth Element.  Outfits and sets are bright and colorful but the physics are, for the most part, nice and accurate.  Backgrounds are tight with accurate mood portrayed throughout (especially the space truck stop ""The Hub"" which features terrain that loops and winds right up the walls).

Effects work invokes back to the era of practical and optical work without reliance upon computer generated imaging (although there are a few examples of it to be found here when wires and lighting work weren't quite cutting it).

I think a lot of the problem people have with this film is the automatic association the title makes with Ridley Scott's 1979 horror thriller, Alien.  Sure both stories essentially tell the tale of the gritty realities of a future-time when interstellar travel is a fact of life and somebody out there is going to be charged with the task of transporting cargo long distances.  Aside from that resemblance, the stories go about their grander arc much differently.  Space Truckers maintains such current-trucker ideals as country music, truck stop cafes, established shipping routes, and corporate greed forcing independent haulers to take dangerous risks to stand a chance.

So long as you realize that this is a light-hearted space adventure designed for a big bowl of popcorn and a few giggles, you will be in for a quite a treat.  Dennis Hopper, in a rare opportunity to play the good guy, delivers just a wonderful performance. He's personable, likable, and downright funny in a majority of his delivery.  A performance rivaled only by the enigmatic Charles Dance, who is said to have accepted the role based on his teenage daughter's enjoyment of the script.

As an added bonus the extras on this disc are surprisingly thorough and include a making of documentary, filmography of the main cast, interactive trivia game, original trailer, and a full commentary track by Stuart Gordon (which is quite interesting).  Finally, it is said there is a hidden bonus feature that can only be unlocked by the viewer.  If anyone out there knows how, please do share.",1249948800,2,4793,5.0418250950570345

Amazon, apparently, has copied the actor list from [...] and so the main characters, who appear further on down the list, do not even appear after the title of the movie.  A potential buyer of this DVD would be looking for the main characters not the bit players.

I have tried to move up the stars in a DVD's list of actors before but have been rejected.  Sometimes, but not always, someone actually looks at what I am trying to do and fixes the problem.  Example:  On Tour of Duty, a female actress was in a few episodes of ONE season but she was the only name Amazon put for all 3 seasons instead of Terrence Knox, et al. Doesn't make sense.  It was finally fixed.

By the way, I really like this movie and would recommend it to those who like sci-fi action movies with good actors (characters!).",1224720000,,896,4.260355029585799
1011193,4,6305336253,"Space Truckers is a different kind of movie than we're used to seeing from Gordon.  It's a little more lighthearted, comical, and slick looking.  Plus it's PG-13, so the over the top gore isn't present.
But the movie is alot of fun.  It's silly sci-fi nonsense that aims to be nothing more than a fun popcorn flick.
Dennis Hopper is a space trucker who gets screwed out of getting paid for his load by an evil pork company.  He then takes on an unregistered and illegal load to transport to Earth.  Little does he know that his cargo is a small army of indestructible killer robots designed by a mad scientist to enable a loon to secure his presidency.  Along for this ride are a rookie space trucker played by Stephen Dorff and Hopper's ""fiance"" played by Debi Mazar.  They're hijacked by pirates who unleash the robots.  It also just so happens that the leader of the pirates is the mad scientist who created the robots.  He's half machine, which leads to some rather funny scenes.
So, Hopper and company have to escape the pirates, stop the evil robots and get to Earth where Debi Mazar's mother is in the hospital.  It's good, fun stuff that reminds me of films like The Ice Pirates and Flash Gordon.  The film was shot entirely in Ireland, and I'm not sure what the budget for the movie was, but the it looks like they definitely made the most of the budget.  Very slick and professional looking, almost as if it could have been made in Hollywood.  Hopper is Hopper, what can you say?  Dorff is passable, but nothing special,  Mazar is also okay but nothing special.  I certainly don't think she's as hot as you're supposed to believe she is.  The always reliable Charles Dance plays the evil scientist/pirate leader/cyborg with the same sophisticated flair in which he usually plays villains.
I was fortunate enough to see this movie at a test screening with Stuart Gordon back in 1997 at the University of Wisconsin.  Gordon did a little Q&A with the audience after the film.  The movie went over quite well with the audience that night.  It was a fun experience and one reason why this movie is particularly close to me.
Well worth it.",1222300800,3,2143,4.560209424083769

I liked the fact that no matter how bad things seem to get for our heroic space truckers, they managed to keep the jokes comming, and your funny bone tickled.

1011233,3,6305336253,"Okay, this wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't a great one, either.  I think the biggest problem this movie had was the script.  It just seemed pretty weak.  I did like the characters, the special effects, and the actors, but I don't think they had enough to work with.

The story involves the last of the independant space truckers, Dennis Hopper, and how he's hired to take a shipment of supicious cargo to Earth which turns out to be ultra high tech killer robots that someone is planning to use to overthrow Earth's government.  Anyway, there's some mildy amusing scenes, and stuff happens which all lead up to the climatic scene at the end involving the killer robots.  As I said before, the special effects look really good and it's obvious that a lot of time and effort was spent in this area.  The pirate ship was really well done.  And, in Stuart Gordon fashion, the pirate captain looked like something out of Re-animator or From Beyond, from his half flesh, half metal head to his pull start groin.

The script wasn't really that strong, and some of the actors almost seem embarassed to be in the movie at times, but they perform adequately with what they are given.  I thought Charles Dance (Alien 3, The Golden Child, Gosford Park) played his role quite well.  And it was nice to see Dennis Hopper play something other that a deranged lunatic for a change.

All in all, fun, light entertainment, just don't expect too much from this movie in terms of a good script or decent character development.",1056672000,26,1508,4.585820895522388

1011275,4,6305336253,"A friend put this on for me the other night and the minute I heard the words ""Dennis Hopper"" and ""low budget sci fi"" I groaned with anticipated discomfort, but was pleasantly suprised by Space Truckers' contents. While far from profound, the film's acceptable Odyssy-esque story takes second chair to a wacked-out, 100% convincing vision of the future and the community of characters who inhabit the portions of it that the film concerns itself with, some of which was quite memorable;
A pirate thug named ""Scummy"", square zero-g pigs, a bar/diner set in a revolving hub ala 2001 to simulate gravity, self-defense mechanisms with apparent senses of humor, and an uproarious, innappropriately hilarious death machine monster that is right out of Red Dwarf. The film has an irreverent view about it's idiom, manages some effective sex appeal amidst the laughs, and has a kind of upbeat infectiveness that might be tied into the comic book/cartoonishly bright color palette that manages to seep into almost every shot.
And in the end what impressed me the most about Space Trucker was that, like the great satires that have come before it who also fashion their own self-contained universes where our laws of physics might not necessarily apply [The Simpson's and Shakes the Clown coming to mind immediately], the filmmakers wisely kept within the framework of the genre they were creating for -- schlocky modestly budgeted sci fi -- and by not bothering to aim any higher produced one of the most entertaining films I have sat through in months.
