8120647,5,B000FC2FOM,"My husband grew up in Moscow but has been in the US for 10 years. He fondly remembers this cartoon - well, the first 10 episodes. He turns his nose up at the last 8 episodes as an inferior tack-on effort. He remembers his dad dropping him off at a movie theatre in Moscow where he would watch the first 10.

Our 7-year-old loves them all, and has since she was 3. One of her first Russian phrases was ""Nu Zeis, Pogodi!, usually accompanied with crazy laughing and chases.

My favorite part of these cartoon is a) the wolf's pink shirt and b) the fantastic music. There are many Russian hits from the ear, and I think Italian music, which was also popluar at the time. Sometimes they sneak in some American jazz like ""Everything Goes"". Remember, these cartoons were made in the Soviet Union!

Anyhow, we love these cartoons - which is good because my kid wants to watch them all the time. She's only recently discovered Tom & Jerry and Looney Tunes, which are also well-loved. I should mention that some of the wolf behavior is not very PC - he drinks, is usually smoking, and in general would prefer it if that sweet little bunny was actually a warm dinner.

NOTE: This version of the cartoon has the sound timing off by just a titch. For example, the wolf kicks the trash can, and after a very slight (but noticable) delay, you hear it. Our first CD I'll Get You! / Nu Pogodi! (green cover) cracked, and we got this edition because it was the only one available at the time. Get the other version instead, its soundtrack is exactly in time, and I think the menu is a little easier to operate for non-Russian speakers.",1416355200,,1618,4.40133779264214
8120648,5,B000FC2FOM,"Love it, but you have to speak Russian, lot's of slang, great acting and very good story

Will watch again",1381968000,,106,4.3
8120649,2,B000FC2FOM,"To me it seems like this movie makes a leap for movies such as Snatch or any of the other Guy Richie classics however it misses pretty bad. The dialogue and acting and very clunky. The humor, in an attempt to be dark and edgy turns out to be unnecessarily crude and coarse.

Overall I'd say skip this one and check out Narkoman Pavlik on youtube if you want some quality new-russian comedy.",1348012800,,390,4.342465753424658
8120650,5,B000FC2FOM,"Bleak and dreary 1990's Russia. Guns, racism, corruption...just great. this film is bolder than any American gangster film could ever be. If you liked Brother (Brat) and have a sense of humor, you'll probably like this one.",1311292800,2,223,5.054054054054054
8120651,5,B000FC2FOM,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It has great dark humor.  I was wondering though if anyone knows the list of bands for the soundtrack, the credits are in Russian?",1229817600,2,160,4.482758620689655
8120652,5,B000FC2FOM,"Since I am Russian I can definitely appreciate this movie. It has action, comedy and it is put well together with a great soundtrack. My English friends enjoyed it as well with the subtitles that it provides. Action packed with lots of gun play, great script and out of this world actors. You will not be dissapointed.",1215388800,5,318,4.5964912280701755
