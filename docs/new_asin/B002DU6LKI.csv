8366060,5,B002DU6LKI,"Red Skelton entertained us for years on television. This is a nice collection of his shows from 1959-1962. Particular favorite episode is from 1960 with the Fabulous Mamie Van Doren. She sings a great song, It's All Right With Me. She flirts a lot with Red. I have met Mamie and she is very gracious to her fans. And admirable fo her stands on women's and gay rights. A living legend of the golden age of Hollywood. Another memorable show is from 1959 featuring Jayne Mansfield.",1382659200,,478,4.569767441860465
