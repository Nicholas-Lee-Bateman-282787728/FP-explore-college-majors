It wasn't funny, there storyline was just ridiculous. It bored me honestly.  Prime was idk, Iiked it a little but the ending made me dislike it. There wasn't really an ending. About a boy was a sweet movie and the wedding date was of course great.",1489363200,2,402,4.153846153846154
4593543,5,B00575GYU8,"I found this little movie bundle for a little over $5 and am very happy with it.  It comes with four movies: About A Boy, Prime, The Wedding Date, and Intolerable Cruelty.  It comes as a two DVD set (two movies per DVD) with separate holders for each.  The case does not have details for each movie but here is a small description for each:

About A Boy (2002) - A cynical, immature young man is taught how to act like a grown-up by a little boy.
Prime (2005) - A career driven professional from Manhattan is wooed by a young painter, who also happens to be the son of her psychoanalyst.
The Wedding Date (2005) - Single-girl anxiety causes Kat Ellis (Messing) to hire a male escort (Mulroney) to pose as her boyfriend at her sister's wedding. Her plan, an attempt to dupe her ex-fianc, who dumped her a couple years prior, proves to be her undoing.
Intolerable Cruelty (2003) - A beautiful gold digger matches wits with a shrewd Beverly Hills divorce lawyer who is increasingly attracted to her.

Overall, it's not a bad set for what you pay.  Thanks Amazon.",1489104000,2,1059,4.461139896373057

4593616,5,B00575GYU8,I bought this set to watch the story of us. It was not available in amazon streaming. I have seem head over heels which is a cuse movie for a girls night or a cold winter day. Who could go wrong with girly romantic comedies?,1420675200,,224,4.0
4593617,4,B00575GYU8,"Bought this because I simply adore the film ""The Matchmaker"" and since it was available with ""Heart and Souls"", I saw this 4-pack as a bonus to get them together. The other films were less than enjoyable . . . though I am glad I didn't pay for them individually. I thought there might be some sort of connection between the four films, you know, actors or theme or anything. But there was no link at all. Had just these two films been together, this would be a 5-star pack. But because the other two bring it way down, I had to settle for a 4.

Heart and Souls is a lovely story about finishing one's work on earth by invading the life of a newborn. Four disparate characters in a bus accident end up becoming a part of Robert Downey's life, first as ""imaginary"" childhood friends. They can never go too far away from him and must put up with his unlovely personality as he gets older. Until the time comes for the four to go to Heaven and they need Downey to interact with those they left behind. Good really does come from within.

The Matchmaker is a tale of a woman who must carry out the odd request of her employer to find his Irish heritage. Unfortunately, she ends up in the middle of a matchmaking festival in Ireland. The result is predictable but there are some great characters along the way, including a couple of the old matchmakers themselves. There really is a matchmaker festival in Ireland, in a little village called Lisdoonvarna, which is quite close to the Cliffs of Moher that overlook the west coast of Ireland. This is not where the film takes place but the event is real and I hope to go myself one day!",1420070400,11,1628,4.3519736842105265

4593628,5,B00575GYU8,I was originally just searching for the Wedding Date but then stumbled across this for just $1 or so more so I bought it. It's just as described and I think well worth the extra dollar for 3 other movies.,1399939200,,204,4.125
4593629,3,B00575GYU8,"This is a great gift for the holiday season. It has just the right amount of young family appeal, but not so much that young adults can't find it enjoyable. A++ in my book. -Joy Johnson http://www.amazon.com/-/e/B00935YTUK",1395187200,,222,5.027027027027027
4593630,5,B00575GYU8,"I bought this for the ""Heart and Souls"" movie.
Which is one of my all time favorites. A must see!
I have it on VHS but wanted the DVD version - it's that good.
The other movies are what I call ""Freebies"".",1387411200,3,204,3.880952380952381

4593632,3,B00575GYU8,"Heart and Souls is wonderful -- the reason I purchased this item in the first place. The Matchmaker is a bit contrived, but still enjoyable. Kissing a Fool is watchable. Playing for Keeps was a waste of the DVD it was burned on. Individual ratings of 5, 3, 2, and 0. The average was rounded up because I like Heart and Souls so much.

4593636,2,B00575GYU8,"First, the idea of putting four pictures in one package like this has a lot of merit. It is a great way to add to your library without spending a lot of dollars.

My wife and I were disappointed in all the films in this collection and as such, would have rated them somewhere between one and two stars for each. They simply did not engage our interest, especially consider the quality of the performers.",1355356800,2,403,4.373333333333333
