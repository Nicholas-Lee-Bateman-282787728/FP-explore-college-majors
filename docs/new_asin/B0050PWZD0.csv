4517271,5,B0050PWZD0,"Sweethearts is my favorite Jeanette MacDonald/Nelson Eddy movie and I was thrilled when it came to DVD.  It's the backstage story of a married couple, the Lunts of operetta, celebrating their sixth anniversary, as well as the sixth anniversary of their show Sweethearts.  They let themselves be manipulated by a cunning producer (played by the always delightful Frank Morgan), their families, and many others, almost at the cost of their marriage.  But like all good musicals, this one ends happily, with MacDonald and Eddy in the clinch, singing.  Along the way, there is lots of amusing dialogue by Dorothy Parker and Alan Campbell, a colorful fashion show (there is nothing better than MacDonald in Technicolor), and some sparkling songs by Victor Herbert.  The DVD includes two radio broadcasts of Sweethearts with MacDonald and Eddy and audio tracks from the film's recording sessions. If you're a MacDonald/Eddy fan, the DVD is a must for these alone, as they include ""Mademoiselle"" (heard only briefly in the film) and ""Angelus"" (a MacDonald solo cut from the final print).

My only complaint is that the skin tones are very pink, like the actors spent a little too much time in the sun.  I've read the original negative was lost in a fire and this is the best print available.  Mine stalls very briefly at the end of ""Badinage"" when played on my computer DVD player.  It didn't annoy me enough to return it to Warner Archives.",1346284800,3,1434,4.892561983471074
4517272,5,B0050PWZD0,"Sweethearts is seldom mentioned on the short list of great MacDonald-Eddy teamings, but it's a feast for fans: rich color photography, a funny script, and plenty of musical opportunities for the two stars, Victor Herbert purists might feel bemused to learn that this is not an adaptation of his show by that title. This film is a backstager about a couple starring in a long-running production that uses the Sweethearts songs (with some new lyrics), so it has a musical comedy feel to it, not that of an operetta. It's really a clever idea: to give MacDonald and Eddy a chance to play contemporary boulevard comedy yet include the kind of music they sang as well as, or better than, anyone else of the time. Lots of fun, too, with the in-laws sponging off them and never tiring of dredging up their old performances and shtick. Very well played by some ""old pros."" What a relief to be able to own this wonderful movie outright, instead of having to wait for it to turn up on TCM.",1335225600,6,979,4.536723163841808
4517273,2,B0050PWZD0,"This is not the Victor Herbert operetta Sweethearts.  Yes, it has the name and the composer's name, but, as typical for Hollywood at the time, the story line and many of the songs that formed the basis of the operetta were discarded.  If you want to see the operetta you will need to find one of the few companies that perform it live.  This film is a Nelson Eddie, Jeannette MacDonald musical -- nice dancing, nice singing, opulent staging but little to do with the operetta that Victor Herbert wrote.  Incidentally the color is gorgeous.",1320710400,4,539,4.6421052631578945
4517274,4,B0050PWZD0,"After years of requests, petitions, and prayers, the MacDonald-Eddy musicals have finally come out on DVD.  Metro Goldwyn Mayer's Singing Sweethearts are as fresh and lively as ever in their first Technicolor movie.
This filmed version of Victor Herbert's VERY loosely adapted operetta ""Sweethearts"" features Jeanette MacDonald as Gwen Marlowe and Nelson Eddy as her singing partner, Ernest Lane.
While I'm thrilled to get MacDonald and Eddy on DVD, I can't help but thinking that the color balance is a bit ""off"" on this transfer. It's very apparent in MacDonald's fashion montage scenes where the saturation of color seems to be too much. Perhaps this is just a glitch of early Technicolor, but it's not something that I remember being an issue in the VHS release of several decades ago. Also, the title screen of the Main Menu is a little drab, and both MacEddy movies feature this same computer-generated Main Menu.  Too bad, because other MGM DVDs have been given more lavish treatment - see ""The Women"" for what I'm talking about.
The bonus features on the disk are a real treasure - but unfortunately there's no way to stop, pause or select chapters for these features. It's exciting to hear excerpts that have never before been released.
In all, it's a great release, but I do feel that Warner could have spent just a LITTLE more time on these remasters to make them everything that we MacDonald-Eddy fans have longed for.",1310256000,16,1430,4.8806584362139915
4517275,5,B0050PWZD0,"Bought for my 85 year old Mother in law.  Who absolutely loved it, only problem being that although the actual DVD is in spoken English the sub titles are in Portugese.",1254960000,3,168,4.419354838709677
4517276,5,B0050PWZD0,"IT IS NOW TIME FOR ALL THE JENNETE AND NELSON EDDY FILMS TO COME OUT IN DVD.
THEY ARE LONG OVER DUE. THEY NEED TO COME OUT IN A BOX SET LIKE ALL THE ESTER WILLIAMS AND DORIS DAYS ARE OUT NOW.  THEY WERE DONE BY MGM AND THAT MEENS THAT WARNER BROTHERS OWN THEM SINCE THERE IS NO MGM.  I AM LOOKING FOR MAYTIME AND SWEETHEARTS.",1249257600,3,325,3.8358208955223883
4517277,5,B0050PWZD0,"Until and unless Turner/MGM releases this movie on DVD in the USA, this Brazilian DVD version is a great alternative to the VHS tape released in the 90s.  What you get is exactly what you want: Nelson Eddy & Jeanette MacDonald starring in this wonderful movie.  Even though it is a foreign release, the movie is in English; the speaking voices of all the actors are the originals and so are the singing voices.  The DVD is ""All Region"" and plays on USA Region 1 DVD players.

The only drawback, which is not much of a drawback, is that the text on the DVD cover and Menu are in Portugese.  In spite of the menu being in a foreign language, it took me only a few seconds to figure out how to ""turn off"" the Portugese subtitles and to get the movie started.

As for the movie, if you've never seen it, the MacDonald/Eddy chemistry is in full force and they are at their best, with a wonderful supporting cast and many terrific songs.

For six years, the very happily married acting team Ernest Lane (Nelson) & Gwen Marlow (Jeanette) have been starring in a hit Broadway play.  But between the daily grind of the play and constant commitments forced on them by their relatives and their careers, they have little time for each other or for relaxation.  When Hollywood beckons the couple with a film contract that seemingly offers Gwen & Ernest the much needed sanity they crave in their lives, the play's producers are faced with their lucrative show coming to an end.  In their desperation to stop the couple from leaving, they hatch a scheme that manages to convince Gwen that Ernest has been having an affair with their longtime secretary.  The resulting fiasco is a riot as Gwen takes her wrath out on an unsuspecting and thoroughly confused Ernest.

This is the only one of their eight movies where Jeanette and Nelson get to wear ""modern"" clothes and they never looked better.  And playing a happily married couple gave the screen & real life sweethearts a chance to openly display their feelings for each other.  If you are a fan of Eddy & MacDonald, you will love watching their interaction in this movie and the plot makes it a must for anyone who enjoys musical comedy.",1238198400,11,2176,4.546153846153846

4517293,5,B0050PWZD0,"I saw this movie in the late 1950s on my family's black and white TV set.  I wanted to see it again and see it in color.

The bonus feature of the song vaults was incredible to listen to. There is a song that Jeanette MacDonald sang that ended up getting cut from the movie. It is beautiful!

4517298,5,B0050PWZD0,"Purchased all 8 of the all time great Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy films for my wife for Christmas. A full 5 out of the 8 DVD's received are completely defective and will not play. This is one of the 5. Completely unacceptable and completely disappointed. I have requested a replacement. I am shocked at the defect rate. What the heck is going on with amazon.

Needless to say I am now watching without delay the 3 remaining DVD's that appear to work just to make sure they are okay so I don't have to replace them as well. Beyond frustrated and disappointed.

UPDATE OF REVIEW: AMAZON KINDLY REPLACED MY DVD TO MY SATISFACTION, ALL IS WELL , THANKS AMAZON FOR MAKING MY WIFE HAPPY AGAIN!",1387929600,3,694,4.5
4517299,5,B0050PWZD0,"Oh my goodness, here I am, again, with my favorite memories regarding movies ... little doubt that the younger generations
would find this ""corny"" ... but it takes me back to such sweet times when I believed that Nelson Eddy and Janette MacDonald
truly loved each other.  And My research tends to make me believe I was right ... It seems that in the 1930's the movie
contracts in Hollywood were extremely overreaching and onerous, so much so that the legal courts found them to be tantamount
to ""slavery"".  This couple were denied the right to have an open loving relationship so long as they were under the contracts
with the movie producers.  They went their separate ways, after being denied permission to marry each other.  Janette
went to England and miscarried their baby there.  They each married other spouses and lived separate lives.
Thanks for preserving this movie .. watch it and see if you can ""see"" true love in their eyes when they sing to each other !!",1379808000,2,969,4.676470588235294
4517300,4,B0050PWZD0,This is the least successful of the films I purchased even though the singing is superb. The modern ambience is partly spoilt by a feeble plot and songs of lesser greatness than in other films. However the garish attempt at technicolour does not help. Cinematicallt it is clever at the suggestion of the passage of time and the loneliness of it at the same time. The title song is worth the watching and waiting for.,1379203200,,416,4.56
4517301,5,B0050PWZD0,This was a great movie.  It contained some of the most delightful and beautiful music ever  performed  by the stars.

8451619,2,B0050PWZD0,"I love Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, but this is probably the worst movie of theirs I've ever seen. Where are those catchy, uplifting operetta tunes? Most of the music just dragged on and on, and the plot was most abusrd---that Gwenn (MacDonald) would believe the ""trap"" that was set for her by the playwright (Mischa Auer)---even for an Eddy/MacDonald flick. The little fashion show Jeanette puts on while shopping for ""California clothes"" is amusing. It appears to me that she is imitating her MGM costars Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford as she struts in the fine digs. The DVD transfer from Warner Archives is very good. I'm sure it's the best print they had, although it shows its age. This was MGM's first three-strip Technicolor outing, and you can tell Technicolor still had a long way to go to reach the perfection of the splashy, colorful MGM musicals of the late 40s and 50s. Jeanette's hair is often flagrantly red, and the rouge on her cheeks at times would have had bulls in Spain charging at her. Sorry, but give me the great B&W films of this great team---Maytime, Rose Marie, Naughty Marietta---and keep your Sweethearts.",1516665600,,1143,4.807106598984771
