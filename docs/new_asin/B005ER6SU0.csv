8468944,5,B005ER6SU0,Really nice DVD... Steve Howe is an amazing guitarist and this film shows how truly talented he is. I will be seeing Yes next weekend and look forward to seeing Mr. Howe perform. You can't go wrong with this one...,1439683200,,214,4.375
8468945,4,B005ER6SU0,What a treat to hear some classic Steve Howe solo works live for the first time.  The concert includes interesting interplay between Steve and his sons.  I purchased the Steve Howe album 34 years ago as a budding young high school guitar player.  Steve influenced me then and continues to do so today.  Highly recommended.,1381017600,2,322,4.8
