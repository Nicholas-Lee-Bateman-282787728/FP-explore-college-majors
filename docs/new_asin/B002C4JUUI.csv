8363113,3,B002C4JUUI,"I asked a Philly native his two cents on the show and he said the following:  I have seen it, and I think it accurately portrays the frustrations that Philadelphians feel toward the Parking Authority. Of course those frustrations are seen from the vantage point of the Parking Authority employees, who are portrayed sympathetically, and I think the point of the show is to make the viewers' sympathy for the employees overshadow any critique of the Parking Authority. I remember trying to contest a parking ticket, and it was so difficult to get any response via phone--and it's so time-consuming to contest a ticket in person--that I ended up paying it. The inefficiencies and unresponsiveness of the system don't get acknowledged on the show, which helps to position the drivers as lunatics.",1339459200,3,793,5.007575757575758
8363114,5,B002C4JUUI,"As a former police officer at the Jersey Shore, this series really shows everything dealing with parking.  ""Customers"" who just won't take responsibility that the ticket was their fault, as well as one parking officer that takes her job a little too serious.  I never did ""booting"" where I worked, so I enjoyed seeing the process of booting, towing, and owners recovering their vehicles.  Good DVD series !",1296777600,4,406,4.9411764705882355

8363116,1,B002C4JUUI,"For starters, I LOVE this show- the show is not the problem here. Its the discs. I bought not 1, but 2 sets of season 2. The first came and all the discs skipped! You could only watch 1 or 2 eps per disc and then the disc would start skipping and you couldn't watch the remaining eps. This was all 4 discs! So amazon kindly and promptly (overnight) sent me a replacement season 2 - same thing but worse. 2 discs skipped and the other 2 would not even play. Maybe its this batch, I don't know. But don't waste your time or money. I'm really disappointed as this is one of my favorite shows!",1264032000,4,589,4.086206896551724
