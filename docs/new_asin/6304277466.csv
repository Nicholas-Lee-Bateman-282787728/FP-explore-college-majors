The opener HHH* vs. Goldust for the IC belt was a nicely executed 15+ minute match with an interesting finish.  Ahmed Johnson vs. Farooq was your basic brawl, but was a pleasure for me to see Ahmed wrestle again.  It's really a shame his career was cut short by injury.  Vader vs. Taker was a decent match, nothing exceptional, but an interesting battle btw. powerhouses (nice to see Vader again).  As for the Rumble, it was fun, nice to see a lot of old faces (and 4 more AAA Mexican wrestlers).  Lots of greats still around near the end, Stone Cold, Rocky Mavia (The Rock), Mankind, Undertaker, Bret Hart, Fake Diesel (Kane), Terry Funk and Vader all hang around till the final minutes.  A controversial ending but still a great moment in Stone Cold's career.  As for the title match Sycho Sid* vs. Shawn Michaels, pretty good match, Sid isn't the best in the world but is carried nicely by HBK. Nice to see HBK return from injury to regain his title in his hometown. Overall one of the better PPVs of 97 and sets up WMXIII nicely.

7866126,4,6304277466,"1.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Goldust w/Marlena vs Hunter Hearst Helmsley (c) w/Curtis Hughes

The build-up for this match was pretty good. I always loved any feud build-up involving Goldust between 1995 to early 1997 because the story telling was always on point. Goldust jumps Helmsley at the walkway and gets the opening minutes of the match in control. Goldust ends up dropping the steel steps down across the back of Helmsley but the referee doesn't call for a DQ. The match sways back and forth with both men getting a great amount of control. Goldust ends up targeting the left leg of Helmsley, attacking it with several moves like the Figure 4, chop blocks, and even executing a knee breaker on the steel steps. In the end, a distraction from Curtis allows Helmsley to attack Goldust with a clothesline and drop him with a Pedigree for the win. The match was a bit long but was solid nonetheless.

7866127,4,6304277466,"I recently bought the first two sets of The Royal Rumble because I love old WWF wrestling. I have the tape to this and its a good Rumble with a few clunker of matches but enjoyable overall. One thing I enjoyed about WWF at this point in time was how they created a storyline. They dragged it out over a period of months and they had a few matches in between and usually a great payoff match in the end.

Triple H VS Goldust: A decent match with Triple H winning in a long one in his signature style.

Ahmed Johnson VS Faarooq: I remember this feud but it wasn't my favorite feud. A decent match and I did like the aftermath.

Vader VS Undertaker: A dream match that was did not live up to the hype.

Fuerza Guerrera, Jerry Estrada & Heavy Metal VS El Canek, Perro Aguayo & Hector Garza: WWF tried to copy WCW with cruiserweights but Vince and WWF never have and never will get how to market cruiserweights. WWF had a contract with AAA(the Mexican wrestling league) but it did not last long. This was a good match.

Royal Rumble: I highly enjoyed this Rumble. They threw in a few Mexican wrestlers-the legendary Mil Mascaras, Cibernetico, and Latin Lover. I hated how Mascaras was eliminated but the Rumble had plenty of action. I enjoyed the ending.

Shawn Michaels VS Syscho Sid: I remeber this feud clearly. Micheals was the home town boy so that basically gives tells you who would win. A very good title match.

Overall, one of the better Rumbles. It was nice to see all the Mexican wrestlers compete and Michaels winning the world title. I wish WWE would put the fatal fourway match that took place after this event. That was a hell of a main event and needs to see the light of day.",1222387200,,1688,4.356687898089172
7866128,5,6304277466,"I can tell you first hand that I rented this a long time ago and let me tell you, it's one of best tapes of 1997(second to the SS 1997 tape) wrestling-wise. The Royal Rumble match itself was pretty entertaining and the World title match between HBK & Sid was not great but pretty hardcore. The rest was ok. I give this PPV a 10 out of 10.",1191283200,,338,3.985294117647059
7866129,2,6304277466,"The best match of the day had to be the High Flying Mexicans' six-man tag team match (the crowd didn't get it), followed by the 30-man Royal Rumble (Austin is made to look like a headlining gladiator while the rest are reduced to imbeciles), and the endurance of Triple H in the Intercontinental title match versus Golddust.  The Farooq vs. Ahmed Johnson script was all hot air and no moves, with exception to Ahmed's tasty powerslam on the table of one of Farooq's ""Nation of Domination"" people.  Suprisingly poor was the Vader vs. Undertaker match.  Neither of them really seemed to have their heart in it.  And the heavyweight championship between Sycho Sid and Shawn Michaels really only highlights the former's problem as a beatable screamer. (Do you really think Michael's was gonna lose in front of his home crowd?)  All in all, save your money.",1189382400,,852,4.808219178082192
7866130,5,6304277466,"Hey there whats up. If you want a great ppv WWF Royal Rumble is it. Next to the Rumble in 1992, this one is star studded. Stone cold Steve Austin, Bret Hart, Triple H, The Rock, Vader, Jerry ""The King"" Lawler, The Undertaker, Mankind, Terry Funk just to name a few. Shawn Michaels ""HBK"" ""the Showstopper"" goes for gold vs Pycho Sid for the wwf championship. This was one of the best Royal Rumbles ever. So if you like the Rumble then i would buy it asap its worth the money.",1187395200,,474,4.21978021978022
7866131,5,6304277466,"I was fortunate enough to be able to attend this PPV in person and sat 7 rows back of the ring. I have to say that it was more fun in person than it ever is on TV. The matches were average at best and the rumble was tons of fun. Topping it all off was the hometown kid, Shawn Michaels, winning his title back. The Alamodome was rocking with excitement. This was a great memory for my brother and I. I would reccommened this video to anyone.",1169510400,,440,4.011363636363637
7866132,3,6304277466,"Ok everyone let's be serious.  This was not one of the greatest Royal Rumbles but it marked the beginning of what was to be the era that would save WWE (WWF) from being defeated from WCW.

I had always wondered what would it be like if a wrestler cheated by sneeking back into the ring after being eliminated and win the Royal Rumble.  And yes, that is what happened when Steve Austin did exactly what any human being with a determined and bold backbone would do.  There have been many matches that many people would say that defined Steve Austin's career, but this Royal Rumble match ushered the WWE (WWF) into the era of attitude.  Shawn Michaels was known for his attitude but it wasn't as attractive and crowd pleasing as Steve Austin's.

For Steve Austin I tip my hat off to you.  He was definitely one of the greatest and most entertaining wrestlers of all time.

I suggest that you rent this video just for the Royal Rumble.

Lastly, I hope Steve Austin thanked Bret Hart for helping his career by pretty much putting an end to his own.  Bret Hart was the best ""bad guy"" of all time, second to Hollywood Hulk Hogan of course.  If you all remember, Bret Hart started out as a ""bad guy"" back in the old days.

Take care and enjoy this historic event.",1137715200,,1255,4.3852813852813854

30 men Royal Rumble Match

This is one of the most unserious royal rumble matches ever in the WWE.Some of this are when numbers 1-5, there is no clock to signal that the superstar is entering the ring. Another one when Bret Hart eliminated Steve Austin and Austin come back to the ring because of the fighting of Mankind and Terry Funk with the referee never saw.

Rating: 7.5/10

WWF Championship

An average championship match with some brutal moves by Sycho Sid to Shawn Michaels like Shawn Michaels hitting  Sycho Sid with a camera and a sick powerbomb on Shawn Michaels to the floor. That's a garbage championship match!

Winner: Shawn Michaels

Rating: 7/10

An average DVD with some ugly matches like the first match in which Triple H wins the Intercontinental title.
