2653785,5,B000I8OOK6,"This film took me back to Russia. The scenery and characters played true to life. The ugly rows upon rows of apartments, the village homes, the Moscow winter slush, and the beautiful white Russian snow, which seems to hide everything that is wrong and ugly.

I fell in love with Yekaterina Rednikova. She reminded me of some of the wonderful interpreters I had on my many trips to Moscow and the interior. Daniel Craig was lifelike. Just like you or me. (No Schwarzenegger, Pierce Brosnan, or Bruce Willis here). Gabriel Macht was an irritant. A necessary fool.

The story, based on the book by Robert Harris, played up to the world's fascination with Stalin, Hitler and the like. Okay, but not as good as Snow Wolf by Glenn Meade. The movie played up to my fascination with Russia and its people. I was not disappointed.",1170979200,75,821,4.655172413793103

The secret turns out to be one that can impact Russia's future. Intent on finding the truth, the Professor, a journalist friend, and a call girl search for the pieces, not realizing that they are being used to further a diabolical plot.

2653787,5,B000I8OOK6,"The places shown in Russia are wonderful. I haven't read the novel, but you can get the idea of how things still are over there when the subject is Stalin. Daniel Craig gives us a great performance as the PHD Fluke Kelso. He's the Stalin expert and he spends the entire movie trying to find an important piece of history and Stalin's son who is about to take his father place in the country.

2653789,4,B000I8OOK6,"ARCHANGEL (the name of a northern Russian town that hides secrets the story discloses) is a film that is not without flaws both in script and in production, but it is a movie of intrigue that makes for a good night's adventure of escape...and political philosophizing.

Dr. Fluke Kelso (Daniel Craig) is an American professor of history visiting Moscow to speak out against the persistent (though small) consistency who revere the dead Stalin and long for the Communist days of yore. He is immediately under suspicion, meets and old man Old Papu (Valery Chernyak) who tells Kelso he has information that will change his attitude.  And the intrigue begins.  Old Papu is the last of the old group of bodyguards of Stalin and was present at Stalin's death, witnessing the transfer of some important information to Beria (Yervant Arzumanyan) that was to be hidden forever.  The Moscow police begin to trail Kelso, kill Old Papu, Kelso discovers Old Papu has a daughter Zinaida (Yekaterina Rednikova) who despite studying for law is making her living as a high-class hooker, and in time Kelso engages Zinaida on a chase to find the hidden documents her father has sequestered.  Along the line the obligatory television press correspondent, American O'Brian (Gabriel Macht) fast talks his way into participating in the chase and the strange group of men adamant to find the lost documents - a group led by Mamantov (Lev Prygunov) - attack and pursue the triad all the way to Archangel where the truths about Stalin's last days are made known: in flashbacks we see that Stalin (Avtandil Makharadze) had a lover Anna (Anna Gerasimova) who was impregnated by the dying Stalin and gave birth to a son Josef (Konstantin Lavroneko) who is just waiting for the right time to make Stalinist Communism rise again.  How all this intrigue resolves is the fairly impressive ending to the story.

This may sound like a flimsy thread for a story but here it works, primarily due to the conviction of Daniel Craig as Kelso, Gabriel Macht as O'Brian and a cast of Russian actors who are very fine.  There is a problem: no subtitles are give, except in Spanish, and though the majority of the dialogue is in English (the Russian dialogue is translated) the Russian accents are so thick that the actors' English can barely be understood.  The cinematography captures Latvia and Russia effectively and the musical score by Robert Lane is additive.  Not a great movie but a tight and entertaining one and one with enough recounting pf the history of Stalinist USSR  to make us remember important facts!

2653790,4,B000I8OOK6,"This movie exposes (to those who were unaware) the unhappy fact that Stalin is still very popular in Russia, that mighty empire which has lived by murder and theft for hundreds of years. The Boys from Brazil was not credible. Very few Germans long for the ""good old Hitler days."" Alas, opinion polls show that a large chunk of Russians do wish for the return of good old Joe. This movie was largely shot in the free Baltic state of Latvia. It shows how bold the Balts are to allow this poke in the eye of the ""great Russian nation"" to be shot in their country. Even more so since Latvia has a large and agressive group of retired Soviet civil servants who have decided to retire there. If you liked the ""Boys from Brazil,"" give this one a look. No Gregory Peck or Laurence Olivier, but a very good cast indeed.",1162944000,9,810,4.3355263157894735
2653791,2,B000I8OOK6,"Robert Harris writes surprisingly good popular upmarket airport bestsellers aimed at Sunday Times and Guardian readers that once upon a time would have been made into self-important overproduced movie potboilers but now (Enigma aside) get made in to misfiring TV series instead (Fatherland, Selling Hitler). Latest failure is Archangel, a historical/political conspiracy thriller set in modern-day Russia where the Maguffin is (initially at least) a hunt for Stalin's notebook before turning into something infinitely sillier. Unfortunately the end result is so flat in almost every single way that you're left with little to do but notice the many plot holes and increasing absurdities in the pared down script that hits plot points but never makes you buy into the story or the clichd characters in any way and seemingly goes out of its way to avoid dealing with any interesting issue that might threaten to crop up en route.

The trick to plots this absurd on the printed page is to surround them with big themes (the ongoing malign influence of Stalin and Russia's communist past, the commercial and political exploitation of history) and a lot of recycled historical research and local color to make people think you know what you're talking about. The trick to this kind of nonsense onscreen, however, is to keep it moving and put enough of a spin on the stock situations so that the audience doesn't stop to think, but screenwriters Dick Clement and Ian La Fresnais come up empty every time: when you see Beria having a soldier bury secret documents IN HIS OWN BACK GARDEN in a hole no more than 18 inches deep, you know that no-one's even making an effort here.

Professionally made and watchable if you've nothing better to do, but it has that tired and uninspired factory feel to it. And who on Earth thought that Daniel Craig was perfect casting for a middle-aged American history professor? He's a fine actor, but he can't bring anything to the table against those kind of odds - not even an American accent. But even he isn't faced with the kind of ridiculous casting that Konstantin Lavronenko fails to conquer as a character who is supposed to be at least 52 years old but looks no older than 30 (although he's actually 45), rendering the final twist even more unbelievable on the screen than it is on the page.",1158192000,9,2326,4.841708542713568

Daniel Craig's character as a college professor was a little bit hard to believe at first after so many years as Bond...James Bond...but he played a little bit of an Indiana Jones professor a little bit Bond and I enjoyed it immensely.

2653856,4,B000I8OOK6,"Fantastic Film puts you in the heart of Russian Culture and History!

This review is for the entire series. How fun to see Daniel Craig outside of the 007 James Bond character! He really can act! I won't spoil this series for you by telling you what Dr. Kelso (Daniel Craig's character) eventually finds, but he stumbles upon something of incredible historic significance. If what he finds becomes known to the world, it will drastically rock the delicate balance of power in Russian and all world governments. Dr. Kelso meets a Russian woman who prostitutes herself in order to study the law. Unfortunately, they meet in less than ideal circumstances. This movie sheds light on how Russians are still divided between those who wish to move into the modern capitalistic world of democracy and those who still yearn for the days of Stalin and communism. It's fascinating to see people who can worship a man who is responsible for the murder of even more people than Hitler. This miniseries does a great job of immersing us into a world we rarely see- most of the film was shot in Moscow, Russia. Some of it was shot in Riga, Latvia which is close by. This gives an incredibly authentic look and feel to the series. I also loved the quality of the filming as well. It's gritty and 'real-life' looking. You feel as if you really are on the streets of Moscow or in the small village of Archangel (which is a real city in northern Russia- its Russian name is 'Arkhangelsk'.)",1509840000,3,1469,4.628352490421456

Prof. Fluke Kelso (Daniel Craig) is lured in with the possible finding of Joseph Stalins diary; soon this turns in to something a little more convoluted and may lead to his death before he can finish his inquiries.

At first, I was confused as to the title of the series (Archangel.) I though some code name or something. Turns out to be the location of the mystery.

It was funny reading the closed captions as when they played the Soviet anthem from 1944, the closed caption said Russian Music.

The BBC series completes in three episodes. So, there is no after thrill mundane drags out of some mystery that lasts season after season.

2653884,4,B000I8OOK6,"Before he was Bond, Daniel Craig was the character Fluke Kelso, a former hotshot history professor with a specialty in Stalin. Craig carries the film throughout, showing a restraint we don't see in Bond. In character, he doesn't have the smoldering violence and assassin savoir-faire of Bond, yet he remains cool under pressure.
He recounts that Stalin killed more people than Hitler, Pol Pot and others combined! The movie goes light on Stalins genocidal tendencies, yet is a reminder of how some people long for Totalitarian rule. The premise is that many Russians miss Stalin's iron fist.
Robert Harris' powerful book, ""Archangel,"" like his previous novels, ""Fatherland"" and ""Enigma,"" makes cunning use of an actual historical detail. The author of ""Archangel,"" is a former television correspondent for the BBC and a columnist for The Sunday Times of London, happens to have written a book about a fraudulent diary, ""Selling Hitler."" That real-life story seems to carry over in the plot of this series about Stalins diary.  No more spoiling, it's worth a watch as current events seem more and more fictional!
After finishing ""Archangel,"" when you think about what happens, you find it so outlandish as to defy credibility. As one character, R.J. O'Brien, an American television journalist for a CNN like network, explains Theyre ready for a new Stalin.",1506211200,8,1355,5.159090909090909
2653885,5,B000I8OOK6,"Archangel is a 2006 British murder mystery and historical thriller from the BBC, which is a film adaptation of the 1998 novel by Robert Harris. Its story line centers around a disillusioned middle-age Oxford historian, who discovers a diary about Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, which had literally been buried away for decades, after the death of Stalin in 1953. This discovery triggers a chain of events that results in murder, mayhem, and intrigue, and the realization that Josef Stalin remains a very popular figure within certain constituencies of contemporary Russian society. Apparently, Josef Stalin is still admired by some present-day Russians for having been a strong and resolute wartime leader, who established the Soviet Union as a major world power, despite being widely reviled as a homicidal despot, who was responsible for the deaths of over twenty million people. As always, the performance of the lead actor, Daniel Craig, is outstanding, as are the performances of the members of the talented supporting cast. Archangel is a decidedly intelligent, suspenseful, and gripping murder mystery and historical thriller, and I found it to be extremely engaging and entertaining. Archangel features superb plot and character development, as well as great acting performances, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1506211200,17,1374,5.516587677725118

Then there is the transgender looking black female character... Attention all filmmakers: Please stop with this. The percentage of odd folks in the general public that want to sleep with mannish looking women is minuscule.

It drags out a bit since it is stretched over three episodes and this series also manages to lose or telegraph all the suspenseful moments and plot points. I watched all of it, but would not recommend it to others. If you are a fan of historical fiction or you're interested in Stalin-era Soviet Union, there are better options available out there. Even as a preview of the contemporary James Bond as played by Daniel Craig -- we love him -- this series is somehow not satisfying.",1504569600,6,634,4.427350427350428

One of the highlights for me was the very environmentally realistic look at the Russia we've all read about, especially the cold wintry scenes.
These were portrayed extremely well.  I watched this in August here in Pa. and needed a cup of hot tea to warm me up during Episode 3 !!!
The only small drawback for me was the dialogue...in some spots I could not make out what some of the characters were saying (in English), and I had to play the scenes a number of times to get the gist of the dialogue.

I have to wonder, though, about people who take off on a dangerous trip because some total stranger told them something about something. You see this in movies all the time. How do they know who to believe? Some automatic BS detector that lets them know the good guys from the bad?

It's OK, but barely.  It looks like it was made for middle-of-the-night TV.  The what-if premise of the film is thought provoking, but the father (and son) are the worst looking examples of who they are supposed to be that I have ever seen; my dog looks more like the character.

Stalin, for all his madness, was revered in the Soviet Union.  Hardliners still talk of him in hushed and reverent tones.  Stalin was a man who could unite a vast country.  As such, any grandson could possibly wield the same power and step into the same role.

Archangel looks at this possibility in a very serious manner.  Daniel Craig's portrays a British professor who is lead to and introduced to Stalin's grandson.  He, along with others, has a heavy decision to make whose ramifications affect Russia and the world in general.",1414886400,2,729,4.640625

But a '5' seems to me to have to mean a reviewer thinks the film is one of the best movies of all time since it is the highest rating you can give.  For me a lot of movies worth at least one viewing will fall into the '3' category which is why I rate ""Archangel"" at that level.

Others have covered the synopsis of the film, improbability of some of the elements of it (like the hiding of the key document), and the portrayal of Russia, so I won't bother with that.  As a film based on various levels of intrigue and some surprise, I think you have to suspend some disbelief when it comes to certain improbabilities.  Not having read the book upon which this is based, however, I cannot say if the film goes too far in failing to meet the tone the book sets (which seems to be one criticism some have stated).  But, lots of films do that and still are okay films.

I think the film is worth watching, at least once, because there is some interesting tension in what happens and how it will specifically turn out.  It will seem to drag on a bit if you hope for an ""action"" film in some way.  It isn't Craig playing Bond by any means.  But it kept my attention.  That said, I would not likely watch it again since there isn't going to be any real suspense as to the outcome.  Knowing that outcome, I can see the film dragging further on subsequent viewing.

This is too tempting for him and he overstays his welcome in Russia. There is no James Bond acrobatics or superman actions, but the action is nonetheless very suspenseful as he attempts to unravel the trail to the truth, which takes him to the city of Archangel at the Arctic Circle.

 Dr. Kelso (fabulously acted by Daniel Craig) is a mild-mannered professor that has gone to Moscow in the middle of winter to do more research in his area of expertise, that being, Stalin and the Communist rule of Russia. While there he innocently gets ""caught up"" in the search for Stalin's illegitimate son who is supposedly living outside of Moscow in a desolate and very frigid area.  In the process of trying to find this son of Stalin,  he encounters some very nasty characters.

There are many twists and turns to this presentation that kept me ""on the edge of my seat"".  This DVD is wonderfully acted and directed.

Before you watch the film make a big mug of hot chocolate and jump into your ""Snuggy"" and hunker down in your favorite chair, for I assure you the Russian winter transcends the television screen and will envelop you as you watch the movie.

  The story is a complex and dangerous tale involving a race to find the illegitimate son of Stalin. It is a wild idea that somehow seems almost possible and certainly is filled with exciting possibilities as the story unfolds. All involved in this film do their very best to make it work and in the end they succeed.

  Daniel Craig is just wonderful in his role as the Dr. Kelso, a bookish expert on Stalin and communist Russia who is drawn into an adventure of a lifetime during a conference in Moscow.

It was to be Russia's naval base on the Arctic Sea, and was the home of the USSR's nuclear submarine fleet during the Cold War.  All this has nothing to do with the movie!

The movie, which is written and filmed by Russians, is a commentary on the loss of power and prestige after the death of Stalin (apres moi le deluge).  Except for Krushchev, all the leaders who followed Stalin were forced to live in his shadows.  The man who killed over 30 million of his own countrymen is remembered fondly by those who survived because of what he accomplished.  He took a totally rural country and turned it into a superpower in less than thirty years, during which he defeated on of the strongest armies that ever existed.

This story follows a group that wants to revive Stalinism in modern Russian by rallying the people behind a 'new' Stalin.  Professor Kelso (David Craig as an expert on Russia) is duped into exposing the new dictator as the son of Stalin by an ingenious series of machinizations.  But, is he really being duped?

Being filmed in Russia, we get to see the dark side of the country, the drunken brutality and the 'anything for a buck' economy.  It's very interesting to see the parts of the cities that were built under communism and how they are deteriorating.

Sometime in the year 2005, close to the city, in the woods, lives the long forgotten son of Joseph Stalin.

La Frenais won the British Academy Award for writing for ""The Commitments"" in 1992.

Daniel Craig portrays historian Fluke Kelso who is presented with a secret from Josef Stalin's past. The film unfolds like a lower budgeted Russian version of The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition) where a historian scrapes with the police to uncover an important secret. Daniel Craig was nominated for Best Actor by the British Academy Awards in 2006 for his portrayal of James Bond in Casino Royale (2-Disc Widescreen Edition) and has appeared this summer in ""The Golden Compass"" and in 2005 in Munich (Widescreen Edition). He does a good job as the historian teetering over the hill who could use one great story and another book to bolster his career. His work is impressive with a surprising emotional range in this plot-centered thriller.

Yekaterina Rednikova plays the Russian Zinaida. She does a good job as the hard-edged woman who works by day and is a lady of the evening by night. Gabriel Macht who was in ""The Good Shepherd"" and A Love Song for Bobby Long plays the tenacious reporter R.J. O'Brien who won't let go of the story. The Russian secret police captain Suvorin played by Alexey Diakov also turns in an excellent and controlled performance.

This film gripped me from the first frame and kept me on the edge of my seat until the final gun explodes. It seems like one needs a rudimentary appreciation of Soviet Russian history to fully appreciate what is being uncovered, not unlike ""The DaVinci Code"" in that regard. This is an interesting and tight drama well worth an evening's viewing. Enjoy!",1199404800,5,1969,4.906906906906907
2654057,4,B000I8OOK6,"Russian history enthusiasts will love this film.  This movie made me wonder about the story of the USSR and the rise of Josef Stalin.  Unlike other notorious world leaders, Stalin (the focus of this tale) was more ruthless and murderous than any of the other infamous dictators in history combined. A fearsome threat to his own people as well as the world, even the USA, Great Britan, France and the WW-II allies feared taking action against Stalin and instead fought with him against Hitler and Germany.  Stalin died in 1953.

If you want to know more about Russia's most ruthless dictator, Josef Stalin, see this movie.

Arch Angel, is a superb mystery/thriller (based on the book) about a university history professor searching for answers to a very young female hired to work for Stalin during his reign.

The story is a riveting, action packed, nail biter.  But the ending left much to be desired--from the DVD I saw there really was no ending. This is the only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5.  Much of the story, but not all, is written in English captions.

The protagonist is an middle-aged historian who's been invited to Moscow for a conference.  While there, an old Russian soldier tells him a story about how he drove Beria--the head of the KGB--to Stalin's dacha on the night that it was discovered Stalin had had a stroke.  Beria eventually found a notebook kept by Stalin that the old soldier helped bury.  The next two hours are increasingly implausible but enjoyable quest for the notebook and its meaning.  They lead to a good climax.
  In the original story by Harris, the implausibility is initially slightly more concealed because more information can be conveyed to give credence to the story.  Due to an average script and poor production values-- both almost certain because of budgetary reasons--the weaknesses in the book are magnified.  Daniel Craig was chosen for obvious reasons and exudes charm but not much more.  He probably was not the best actor for the role if the producers wanted to stay close to the book.
