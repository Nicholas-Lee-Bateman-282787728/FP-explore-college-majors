8091227,3,B000BR4UP8,"The Traum Brothers try to take some of the mystery and pressure off of beginning Blues guitar.
Their approach is casual and easy to understand.  Guitar HARMONY is an underdeveloped field of study these days and its nice to share the Traum brothers DECADES of experience and have fun learning the nuances it takes
to become a competent blues guitarist.  As good a start to becoming a better guitarist with a good foundation for ensemble blues playing as there is to date.",1229212800,,470,4.719512195121951
8091228,5,B000BR4UP8,"both parts of this DVD are invaluable to both beginner and intermediate guitarists.  With Happy Traum, you never fail to learn something, on anything he teaches or hosts (when he hosts another teacher, he actually guides the host into a proper pace for students).  Volume 2 is great for intermediate or even advanced guitarist who need music to practice to!

Artie Traum, however, is a different instructor in his own right.  Artie's a gifted musician, singer, composer but he must not be overlooked as a teacher.  He is that ""cool"" teacher you had in high school that took boring history and brought it to life.  Every DVD that I have (in short order, I will have everything Artie is in!) with Artie shows an enthusiam that is just so contagious.  I have even recorded the demo songs that they do and burn them onto CDr:  not for guitar practice, but for enjoyment in the car!  They are that good.  Artie has this subtle background harmony that is very pleasing to the ear.

As a guitar student, don't pass up anything with Artie's name on it.  If you love Happy's teaching, you will love Artie's and enjoy the difference between the two gifted brothers.  I love the banter between them.  No egos, no sibling rivalry (at least none that comes across in the DVD!) and you get some of the greatest music taught, close up, with the beauty of a pause button.

What would be the hourly rate to pay Happy or Artie to teach you private lessons?  ha.  Couldn't happen.  through DVD, that is exactly what you get.

Also, take a look at iTunes and search on both Happy and Artie.  Their music will bless you richly.  My little ones *at age 5 and 7, know most of their songs by heart and love to sing them.  Whether it is Happy breaking your heart with his version of ""Delia"" or amazing you with Dylan's ""buckets of rain"", or Artie's gentle introduction of jazz into acoustic guitar, these men are American treasures.

With respect to their guitar lessons:  I own more than 50% of the Homespun DVD offerings and within a few years, will own it all.  I also own drumming for kids, keyboard (my son) and some of their vocal lessons (and 1 harmonica lesson from John Sebastian, another great personality on DVD!).

Homespun has won many awards, and as a formerly homeschooling Dad, their material is second to none!  Sorry to be so long winded........the material that they put out is THAT good.",1207267200,3,2382,4.556603773584905
8091229,4,B000BR4UP8,"Happy and Artie take a good look at helping you get going right away on jamming the blues.  The approach and instruction is easy enough for any guitar player to follow, and will have you jammin in no time.",1142899200,3,205,4.256410256410256
