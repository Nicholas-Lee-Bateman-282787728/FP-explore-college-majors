8660694,5,B00KQ31HLM,"I purchased this on the strength of my previous introduction to Lise Berthaud as violist with Eric Le Sage et. al. in a wonderful recording of the Faure Piano Quartets.  Her playing in the Berlioz Harold en Italie is top drawer, and what immediately stands out is her huge, warm and relaxed tone, with spot-on intonation throughout.  Slatkin and the Lyon orchestra are with her all the way, in a very vivid recording with a wide soundstage and natural balance.  I've always appreciated Mr. Slatkin's catholic range of genres and his approach with this French orchestra is idiomatic and colorful.  My previous favorite in this work has been Dutoit with Pinchas Zukerman in the solo viola role, but I feel this one is at least its equal.",1476316800,,735,4.7637795275590555

8660696,3,B00KQ31HLM,"This is truly a blu-ray audio disc, the source material for many of which are recorded at 96/24.  The previous reviewer is incorrect to suggest that 192/24 provides improved S/N ratio, as the S/N ratio is determined primarily by the bit-depth, not the sampling rate, especially when the latter is already well beyond that required to encode beyond human hearing.
However, this recording does have serious problems.  As much as I enjoy Harold in Italy and looked forward to a modern multichannel recording thereof, the clearly audible breathing of the violist in this closely miked recording is very distracting.  The recording engineers must have heard this but decided to issue the recording anyway, which was irresponsible.  Overall, this recording is much less enjoyable than the classic recording on RCA, available in 3-channel SACD, with William Primrose, Munch, and the Boston Symphony from 1958 or 1959.  Nothing in this recording, including the recorded sound, is an improvement over the Munch/Primrose recording other than the extra two channels.",1411344000,2,1055,5.331325301204819
8660697,3,B00KQ31HLM,"This disk is misrepresented as a Blu-ray audio disk. In fact, it is recorded at 24/96 (DVD standard) as opposed to the Blu-ray standard of 24/192. The latter encoding offers a greater S/N ratio.
There are, unfortunately, other problems.
The design of the disk requires that you pass through a severe anti-piracy statement that becomes tiring immediately; it appears on each load. This is the old, threatening approach towards classical music that has rightly made it unappealing to many.
You then should select between 5.2 and stereo formatting on your TV or monitor. Using the instructions on the disk for accessing the music without a screen did not work for me. Purchasers who are planning on putting the disk in a player and hitting ""play"" are warned it will not operate this way.
Also troubling is the approach towards miking the orchestra. The overall feel is as if you are seated in the hall behind a door without the immediacy of a real Blu-ray production - cf. Chailly's recordings with the Gewandhaus to see how good orchestral miking can sound.
Slatkin is one of the great conductors of our day and, so, it is disappointing that he is not shown conducting the orchestra. Surely both he and the orchestra are deserving of better. The performances are accurate but lacking in any sense of large-scale concept or drama.
I purchase Blu-rays with the hope of repeated enjoyment and do not return to this one because of the issues noted above. The three stars supplied above are completely for the talent and potential of the performers; otherwise this specific ""Blu-ray"" would receive one star.",1409702400,,1600,4.886029411764706
