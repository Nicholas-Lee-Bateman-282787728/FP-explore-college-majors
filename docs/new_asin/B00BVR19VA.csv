8574579,4,B00BVR19VA,"Very good, it taught me a lot and I had a chance to use it in real life when some idiot attacked me while I was in a grocery line.  There was something wrong with this guy and I feel if I did not know this he would of hurt me real bad.  Even with people standing around and were shocked that this person would attack someone like me who can barely walk and with a cane, but no one did anything, they were cowards.",1418860800,9,413,3.847058823529412
