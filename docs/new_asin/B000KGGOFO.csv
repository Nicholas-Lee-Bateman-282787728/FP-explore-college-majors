8368487,4,B000KGGOFO,"I have the Breed All About it VHS, I thought it was rather good. If they say the DVD is 30 mins long and it's actually 23 mins this is miss leading, They didn't design the Breed All About series to cover EVERY SINGLE little detail. It's just a brief view of various breeds, if someone wants in depth detail contact a GOOD Doberman breeder.",1254700800,,339,4.230769230769231
8368488,1,B000KGGOFO,I am very disappointed with this video.  It is only about 23 mins long and has nothing special inside this video.  I am misled by the official information which said this video is 30 mins long.  This is not a helpful video for Doberman lovers.,1218585600,3,243,4.355555555555555
