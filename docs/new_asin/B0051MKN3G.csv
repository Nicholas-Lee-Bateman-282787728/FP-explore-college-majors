4523267,5,B0051MKN3G,"This documentary reinforced my appreciation for how the Gospel changes even the hardest, most self-absorbed God-hater. Newton had religious training in his background but as a seaman, he turned his back on God and the Bible, eventually overseeing ships involved in the slave trade.  When he personally embraced the truth about what Jesus Christ had done for him, Newton's heart began to change and his practices as well.  He eventually abandoned the highly lucrative but degrading slave trade and strongly influenced men like William Wilberforce who were seeking to have the slave trade abolished in Britain (which eventually did occur).

Newton became a pastor and began writing poems to be set to music, forming songs that could teach the common people of his region and parish biblical truths, since songs help people remember truth and thus live differently.  What has since become the most famous song he authored is ""Amazing Grace.""

My favorite line in this documentary was also my favorite line in the film ""Amazing Grace.""  Late in life Newton was asked for details about an event.  He said, Although my memory's fading, I remember two things very clearly: I am a great sinner and Christ is a great Savior.  It struck me that his was a life well lived and kept the main thing the main thing.",1404518400,9,1300,4.904109589041096
