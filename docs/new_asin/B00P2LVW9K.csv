6786238,4,B00P2LVW9K,"Ever since Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale (2010) Ive been waiting for the next great holiday horror movie. Rare Exports was pretty good and I consider it a very special holiday horror fantasy that holds a place in my heart, but it didn't quite live up to the two short films (Rare Exports, Inc. (2003) and Rare Exports: The Official Safety Instructions (2005)) that generated all the hype leading to its creation.  But there is hope yet!!!  Michael Doughertythe brilliant mind that wrote and directed the much celebrated Halloween horror anthology Trick r Treat (2007) and is working on the upcoming Trick r Treat 2has returned to bring us the twisted cautionary Christmas fairy tale of Krampus

Krampus opens with an all-too-familiar but appreciated social commentary of our long forgotten family values.  Sharing, forgiveness, love and togetherness have been cast aside in lieu of rude comments, sharp-tongued jabs and obligatory gatherings.  The film doesnt take itself too seriously in the beginning, which is goodgreat, in factas the introductory act is littered with holiday humor, including chaotic shopping scenes illustrative of our materialistic oblivion and crotchety family members clashing with one another.  Theres drinking to take the edge off dealing with family, unwanted relatives you cant stand yet didn't want to leave alone, children fighting, in-laws bickering, adult siblings competing and judging each others family values.  Needless to say, this will satisfy more sarcastic fans.

The plot is simple.  A boy who loses faith in his family inadvertently creates a terrifying holiday by summoning the Christmas demon Krampus.  Our monsters victims boasts an impressive cast, including Adam Scott (Hellraiser: Bloodline, Piranha 3D), Toni Collette (Fright Night, The Sixth Sense), David Koechner (Final Destination 5, Cheap Thrills) and Conchata Ferrell (Edward Scissorhands, Two and a Half Men)all of whom with a fair share of horror and comedy experience.

Writer/director Doughertyss Trick r Treat was an impressively nuanced Halloween anthology with diverse effects and expertly interwoven stories.  The movie blew away my expectations and left me hopeful that Dougherty has just as lovingly and patiently architected Krampus.  Well, Trick r Treat fans should be quite pleased with Krampus, which likewise features a good diversity of Christmas-esque monsters presented in tongue-in-cheek scenarios.  I may not have been overly pleased with the elves or the baby angel doll, but the Jack in the Box and teddy bear monsters were absolutely delightful, the Krampus itself was pretty damn cool, and the gingerbread men had to be my favorite!

To my disappointment, the humor from the first act hardly transitioned through the rest of the story.  However, as it becomes increasingly obvious that something is amiss, witty exchanges are abandoned for darker scenes such as harrowing snowmen mysteriously appearing in the front yard, a dire chase with Krampus leaping across rooftops (all CGI, but very exciting), and the harbingering of toys and wrapped presents that offer us an eager but dark anticipation.

Budget limitations were apparent with inexplicably masked elves and the completely stationary Krampus facelike, he had a single frozen, open-mouthed facial expression.  That said, the elves still adopted an effective Gremlins-like menace and the Krampus monster still looked awesome.  And, again, I must say how much I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the scenes with the Jack in the Box monster and those gloriously fiendish gingerbread men!

This was a really fun movie experience.  Not at all scary, hardly even jumpy, and with minimal goreyet very funny (in the first act), thoroughly entertaining and perpetually delivered with a dark, tongue-in-cheek atmosphere.  The ending is equal parts awesome, appropriate and predictablebut most importantly, the ending suits this dark holiday fairy tell perfectly.",1449619200,13,3927,5.466887417218543
6786239,1,B00P2LVW9K,"This film bastardized the true frightful Krampus. of European lore.  None of this movie made any sense if you know the history of Krampus. Children of the Alpine regions of Europe are terrified of Krampus and would probably laugh at this film as I did.  It was absolutely horrible with little in the way of fact about Krampus.  I did not expect a documentary, blood or gore but did expect a littlenmore realism as to the true Krampus than this film provided. I could not nor would nor recommend it, its that bad!",1449360000,11,512,4.483870967741935
6786240,4,B00P2LVW9K,"With plenty of spooks and humor, and virtually no gore to speak of - this makes for a thoroughly entertaining movie for families with teens or for adults looking for a fun alternative to the plethora of warm and fuzzy Christmas specials. It's obviously inspired by 80's fantasy creature flicks (think Jim Henson) as well as the Christmas horror movies of the time. While it's not perfect (what film truly is?) I really feel that the filmmakers accomplished what they set out to do, and I, as moviegoer, had a blast. If you want something more mean-spirited and violent - there are a handful of options, beginning with ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" and ""Christmas Evil"", both from the decade in which this film owes its inspiration.",1449360000,3,730,4.801587301587301
6786241,5,B00P2LVW9K,"Michael Dougherty set out to make a very Gremlins inspired horror comedy. He succeeded. I'm am obsessed with his Halloween cult classic- Trick r Treat. He made the Christmas equivalent with Krampus. I've read where he even mentioned that this film could possibly take place in the same universe as Trick r Treat. The look and feel are somewhat similar. If you liked it, you'll love Krampus... As someone mentioned already, there was some confusing editing. I'm sure the studio forced a PG-13. It didn't harm the film, but I'm hoping the blu-ray release will contain the theatrical and a unedited ""director's cut"" of the film.",1449360000,7,625,4.90566037735849
6786242,5,B00P2LVW9K,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Krampus""

1. This poisoned holiday card is my new all time favorite Christmas movie.

2. This is a weird little indie movie that somehow got big-budget Hollywood backing. It's based on the old German legend of Krampus, a horned creature that shows up at Christmas time to kidnap and kill bad children.

3. It's about relatives getting together for the holidays. They all hate each other. When one of  the kids loses his faith in a happy life, the neighborhood is assaulted with a blizzard... and some pretty nasty things in the blizzard.

4. The movie is hard to categorize. It starts out as a mean-spirited comedy and dark cultural satire. But it increasingly adds horror elements, so it ends up being very different than it started. It's an odd combination, and some people won't like it just because they aren't sure what it is that they are watching. If you want a full-on horror movie, you may be disappointed. But that's not what it's trying to be, and it makes that clear from the very first scene.

5. It was written and directed by Michael Dougherty. Dougherty also wrote and directed my favorite Halloween movie, ""Trick 'r Treat"", which has a similar feel and style to this one.

6. Some of the horror sequences are confusingly edited, which makes me suspect they were cut down so the movie could go from being rated 'R' to 'PG-13'. This is annoying, but the movie doesn't lose its punch. So while this movie may not be rated 'R' it is NOT for little kids. Some children will be terrified by the events of this film. Some adults may even object to a few scenes.

7. There is an underlying theme of sacrifice in the film, including the sacrifice of innocence.

8. I was worried about how the movie was going to end, but Dougherty doesn't betray what he built up. The conclusion of the film was very satisfying.

9. This movie takes everything you love about Christmas and twists them inside out. It corrupts all that is sacred about the holiday. It's a beautifully whimsical, horrific fairy tale that exposes the human darkness and false happiness of the most wonderful time of the year.",1449273600,209,2125,4.612732095490716
6786243,5,B00P2LVW9K,"I rarely see a horror movie where there is a great message, besides from beware or die. This horror-comedy movie is a complete package too: Funny (very!!), Freaky (or weird in a very good way), Creepy, Shocking and Horrifying. Krampus is a christmas devil that visits children or families that are naughty in christmas, but in this case the family has already lost the spirit of Christmas. And Krampus has come to teach them a lesson that they will never forget. In the end, the movie will tell you that CHRISTMAS is a season of giving, sharing, loving, and forgiving. The only thing that bothers me is that the movie seems like Christmas is Santa Clause or Saint Nicholas's Day not Jesus's Birthday. But any other than that, the Movie is amazing! Great Acting, effects, and musical scoring. Will definitely buy it and watch it every Christmas. Perfect for the whole family.",1449273600,11,874,4.756578947368421

6786246,3,B00P2LVW9K,"Krampus (Brad Weaver) is given a list by his brother Santa (Paul Fern) of bad kids who deserve killing. Jeremy Duffin (A.J. Leslie) was such a kid, but he got away. Now as an adult he is a police deputy and obsessed with finding the child killer. When the killings again start to happen his posse goes hunting.

This was a film that was so bad, it was good...at least in several places such as Santa berating a child; the fake heart still beating, and the young Jeremy being dragged in a sack and tossed in a frozen pond. However some of the film plot was undeveloped. What was that bar fight about? The last name on the list- seriously?

I liked the opening credits and the music during the opening and closing credits...""We Party with the Elves."" The film needed a little extra something. The cop conversation at the bar displayed some really bad acting and dialogue.

Would be okay as a Redbox rental.

I was curious, whether the downward spiral of everything going wrong would continue, or whether the young protagonist would save the day. By the way, said young protagonist, Max Engel (played by Emjay Anthony), played his specific archetype very well alongside Omi Engel (played by Krista Stadler). Think of a Harry Potter - Albus Dumbledore relationship. The ending shocked me better than what I had expected, although I had to read Wikipedia to confirm or disprove a certain suspicion.

6786370,3,B00P2LVW9K,"Most movies about the holiday our badly misled world knows as 'Christmas' revolve around money - and how it makes everything all right in the end.
Very, very rarely do we get a cinematic glimpse into the TRUE folklore origins of Winter Solstice celebrations, and when we do, it's usually been twisted and falsified in the usual movie ways.
Krampus isn't entirely free of the latter, but it does have some good moments, especially those with Austrian stage actress Krista Stadler, who plays Omi (grandma), she's decidedly the star of the show.
It's ot a great movie, but it is unique and entertaining enough to earn a spot on the December rotation.
For those interested in the background, I suggest looking into the Norse God Thor and his goat-drawn chariot (which makes the thunder), the Scandinavian Julebock (Yule Goat) who accompanies Juletomten (the Yule Dwarf)....starting to sound familiar?....good.....you're on the way.

If you liked the movie Gremlins then I'm betting you'll like this even more. It interwines horror and comedy in that perfect way and still has that warm Christmas feeling to it. It ties it up with a moral ending and you've actually been reminded of the importance of the""spirit of Christmas"" through this entertaining delight. This movie includes a few familiar faces of comedic actors that play out beautifully. This movie really could have flopped and I believed it very much lived up to it's full potential.

The insidious snowmen that keep popping up around the family home to provide silent menace are just great,  and the Krampus and his entourage are scary enough to make anyone think twice about being a bah humbug. The only thing that holds this movie back is that there seems to be two personalities wrestling for creative control, one is a fan of a good scare, the other, an actual serial killer, instead of sharing that control. For every maniacal gingerbread man that makes you giggle with whimsical horror, there is a hungry Jack-in-the-box that has either crawled out of or will now crawl into your nightmares. It works because the tonal shifts are for the most part unsettling rather than distracting.

All the filmmakers can do is make sudden loud noises, as though they are under the mistaken impression that startling equals scary.  They are also under the impression that snow acts like quicksand.  This horror movie starts out with an unoriginal slapstick comedy routine, which should give you an idea as to how bad it is.  The story takes forever to get started, wasting a lot of time as a horrible-relative comedy along the lines of National Lampoons Christmas Vacation.  Once the monsters finally show up, the movie turns into nothing more than Bitchy Family Vs Demonic Toys.  Krampus himself finally does show up, but the appearance and effect is static, unimpressive, and not scary.  The backstory about Krampus himself is, strangely, shown in a Tim Burtonesque animated sequence.  And finally,

6786415,2,B00P2LVW9K,"Krampus(released Nov./15)stars,among others,Toni Collette,David Koechner,Allison Tolman and Adam Scott. It starts out nicely, but soon devolves into a cliche' ridden monster with terribly cheap S/FX,in the form of the Krampus and his crew.
The film starts with Collette and Scott as the heads of the household who are having Xmas at their place. They live with Dad's German born mother,and have two kids,one pre-teen boy and his teen sister. Their son writes a letter to Santa but doesn't mail it. When Mom's sister and her hubby and brood of kids show up with their obnoxious Aunt, all hell breaks loose later at the diner table. Two of their girls have gotten a hold of the son's unposted letter and read it aloud. The son and sisters get into a scuffle, with the son retreating to his room. He rips up the letter and tosses it out his window,which rises mysteriously into the air.
Shortly after the power goes out in the entire neighbourhood. With no power and a wicked storm whirling outside, the family hunkers down to weather the storm. The host familie's daughter decides,and gets permission to,go see if her boyfriend is alright, as she can't raise him on her phone. Outside the storm is fierce and after a short while the sky darkens even more. She sees some entity atop a roof top and runs back towards home. While hiding under an abandoned truck she is abducted by...something.
Back home the Dad's decide to brave the elements and try to find the missing daughter. They have no luck and  become besieged by some entity who almost gets the visiting brother in law. They hobble back home and tend his wounds. Later the old woman decides to tell a story of when she was a child and the town she lived in forgot the meaning of Xmas. That year her family was abducted by Krampus,who is an anti-St. Nicholaus who comes to punish and take those who have lost the Xmas spirit. Though initially poo-pooed,the entire family soon comes under siege as the two visiting sisters get taken, and a reconnoiter of the attic results in an all out assault. Back down stairs,while sleeping,one boy is lured to the fireplace by a ginger bread man attached to a chain. This quickly swirls about him and pulls him up the chimney. Collette awakens in time to try and pull him down ,and she herself is almost pulled all the way up the chimney until her hubby intervenes to prevent it. It is not long now until the entities outside start invading the family inside, and before long all are gone,except the young man who wrote the torn up letter. He ends up confronting Krampus and his crew near an opened portal ,presumably to Hell, in the ground. It's all to no avail as Krampus throws him into the hole also.
Next thing he knows he is waking up in bed Xmas morning and falls out of it. He goes downstairs to see everything,including his family,back to normal. His wish to have a Xmas the way it used to be,seems to have come true after all. As they sit opening presents the boy gets an old bell,just as his grand mother had when her family was taken. Suddenly the memories of what happened the days leading up to that time come flooding into everyone's minds. The camera pulls back to reveal the house to be in a snow globe. Farther back still it sits among countless other snow globes.
The film moves along quite well for about the first 40 minutes,until the two Dad's come back from being attacked outside. Then it falls into those cliched moments where folks start getting abducted and attacked when they shouldn't be,except for their own stupidity. Then comes our first looks at the monsters themselves. The attack in the attic with a big jack in the box,the screwy looking angel,then one by a sharp toothed bear are just too far fetched and phony looking to be believed. Then there are the ginger bread men in the kitchen with the nail gun. C'mon. Krampus himself,who looks like a decrepit anti-Santa Claus, always has his mouth open. The S/FX department couldn't have at least made a mouth that closed at some point?It made it obvious it was a cheap prop;along with the other mask wearing minions of Krampus's unholy crew,who for all intents and purposes looked like creatures from Labyrinth,but not as well done. When the attic attack comes they(the film makers) lose all believably. And by the time the boy confronts Krampus over the portal to Hell,well,it's all over but the laughter.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. There are a few extras like an alternate ending,a small featurette,a gallery and more.
All in all a movie with potential, that soon implodes in on itself. It's cliched plot(been there,done this sooo many times) and less than effective S/FX(cheap!) doom this sinker stinker to the gloomy depths of Davy Jones locker in short order. A must to avoid.",1494979200,,4810,4.6521739130434785

6786442,5,B00P2LVW9K,"do you think some of these Christmas movies have a Jewish Cast? Elf,Krampus? That has nothing to do with the movie just something I think when I see holiday movies.  This is a fun horror movie that is easy to watch over and over ,even off season. Fun movie with a great cast. I didn't know when I saw the preview how Adam Scott would be in something like that..but he played it off well. I was a little disappointed seeing the extra footage of the art. What I hope to see is crazy drawing of these creatures..but they showed computer graphics. The movie needs to have action figures made..I almost wish the movie was done by the audience following the creatures, just because they were so interesting. The Aunt was funny. The kids were basic brats and got what was coming to them. I like seeing movies that the houses doesn't look lived in and they had art  on the lower side of the bar..that was an odd choose. As a note seeing the movie so many times you see dumb stuff like this..
Very enjoyable. I laughed, I cried,better than Cats",1489968000,,1035,4.357512953367876

It goes for a National Lampoons Christmas Vacation sort of vibe, resulting in perhaps a chuckle of two (the ""funniest"" jokes are all in the trailer so...yeah).  Then some monsters show up and start killing people.

The main problem is I didn't care about any of these people, instead of feeling scared for these folks, I was deciding which order I'd like to see them die in.  The monsters were well done, especially the nasty CGI gingerbread men.  There was some beautiful winter snowstorm scenery and it could have ben atmospheric, but it goes for more of a B-movie vibe and never really establishes any atmosphere.

Overall it was a decent enough waste of 90 minutes.  Nothing special at all, but there are plenty of worse movies out there.",1483401600,,822,4.787234042553192

6786614,3,B00P2LVW9K,"You will enjoy this movie a bit more if you see it as a plain black comedy movie and do not take it seriously. In the beginning you may take some of the characters seriously because they are relatable, but as the movie progress you will see this movie is all a big joke. So it sets you up for something different than what you were expecting, after you make that switch you will like it. It has horror elements but no scary scenes really. Still, wouldn't recommend a child to see it.
I give it 3 stars because although I thought it was funny and entertaining, I feel like the writers could have done better.
This is a movie you will enjoy if it's free or for less than $2. It's a movie to see once and that's it. Wouldn't buy it or see it again, not the whole movie anyways.",1482710400,,774,4.098684210526316

Scary and funny is good, but a movie with actual heart is what really gets you, and Krampus has ALL of that. I'm really surprised how well done this was. I may just have to buy the blu ray and turn this into an Xmas tradition. AND TO ALL THE HATERS, WELL . . . I BET YOU WON'T SAY IT TO KRAMPUS' FACE!!! ",1482624000,2,598,4.111111111111111

6786670,5,B00P2LVW9K,"This is a good comedy horror film.  It also has a moral, to keep the Christmas spirit alive.  When this family looses the Christmas spirit, after fighting and bickering at one another and one of the kids tearing up a letter to Santa, they unintentionally summon the Germanic demon known as Krampus.  Krampus and his minions harass the family, and one by one get kidnapped by them, therefore the family must put their differences aside to battle Krampus and his minions, otherwise all is lost.

Now what do I think of this film, the good news is that its not boring at all.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and although some of it might come off as silly, keep in mind this is a horror comedy and its meant to make you laugh and think about the Christmas spirit.  There is hardly any gore in it, which I think is refreshing since some horror comedies go overboard with the gore.

6786692,4,B00P2LVW9K,"Krampus was on my to-watch list for the last year because I thought the poster art looked like some third rate campy horror. One year later, I thought it would be a good time to watch this. Wow, I wish I'd watched it sooner. It's my new favorite Christmas Horror movie.

There are many words that can describe this movie: comedy, horror, family, holiday. It's a little bit of everything, and that's where your enjoyment of it will be decided. For me, the tone throughout the movie was uneven. I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but there were some scenes where I was thinking, ""This is really scary, but there's something funny. Should I be scared or laughing right now? I don't know!"" My brain was all thrown in a twist. It is a 1) Christmas movie, 2) it's very scary, even for kids, 3) it does feature a family, so I presume this is a family movie (it's PG-13), and 4) there are some elements of dark humor in here.

How do I talk about Krampus without giving too much away? Let's just say he's the anti-Santa. I'm sure you know a few of those in your life. This isn't to say only people who are anti-Christmas will enjoy this, this movie should be watched at least once by everyone. A thing I love about this film is the production design. A lot of work went into designing the characters; each is quite unique and might give you nightmares. I was so impressed I even bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Art-of-Krampus/dp/1608876535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Art of Krampus</a>&nbsp;book; *that's* how good it is.

I'm trying to think of similar movies that you could compare this to that I saw as a kid that was really scary at the time, but was ultimately within family-friendly territory. '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gremlins/dp/B00KQ9UTSI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gremlins</a>,' and, '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Witches-1990/dp/B002SQNLBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Witches (1990)</a>,' are two movies that are similar to Krampus.

If you've never seen Krampus, watch it right now, this month, holiday time! And have yourself a Merry Christmas! Recommended.",1481673600,3,2227,5.48396501457726
6786693,5,B00P2LVW9K,"I saw this in the theater last year.  This movie is what you would get if you put every negative X-Mas stereotype:  the fighting on black Friday, the forced merriment and company of relatives that hate each other, the snotty, rude kids, the old world Grandmother and the one drunken Aunt.  Add a dash of Tim Burton. A touch of Rankin Bass. A pinch of ""Home Alone"".  A hint of ""Gremlins"".  Let it simmer for a few minutes.  Drop in one F-bomb for potency.  A drop of ""Be careful what you wish for"" moral of the story.  Shake well.  Now you have ""Krampus"".

It's a great anti X-mas movie.  Maybe not the cult status of ""Silent Night. Deadly Night"" or ""Christmas Evil"" but a great new counter holiday film.  Some scenes might be scary for younger viewers but otherwise enjoy it and maybe even take lessons from it.",1481673600,,811,4.405405405405405

This display of dubious holiday behavior doesn't begin to suggest the murder and malfeasance that is unleashed upon the sorry souls who chose naughty over nice prior to the Yuletide.  Krampus,  the anti-Saint Nick,  leaves no quarter in imparting  harsh lessons to those misbegotten souls who have not embraced the true meaning of Christmas.  Director Michael Dougherty paints a stark, harsh, and unforgiving landscape that engulfs the dysfunctional denizens of Pittsburgh this fateful Christmas Eve.  The film plays like a cross between ""The Evil Dead"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"".  I view ""Krampus"" more as a cautionary tale than a conventional horror film.

At times, I get a bit put off by the current trend to take classic, clean-cut traditions and transform them into the dark, sinister and horrific.  But somehow in this movie, it totally works.

WARNING:  SPOILERS!!!  If you want to view the movie without knowing any of the ""good stuff,"" don't read any further.
************************************************************************************************************************
The movie opens to the strains of a Bing Crosby Christmas classic, as a horde of anxious, greedy Christmas shoppers barge through the doors of a department store, calously knocking over merchandise, Christmas decorations, and even some of the the store's unfortunate staff in the process.  Amid scenes of grabbing, fighting, and struggling shoppers, Bing's mellow, melodious strains of peace on earth, good will toward men seem totally out of place.  The scenes are filmed in slow motion which seems to enhance the disparity between the music and the mayhem, thus setting the theme of the entire movie.

A young boy, angered and discouraged by his family's apathy and cynicism toward the holidays, tears up a letter he had written to Santa, thus unleashing Santa's nemesis...a creature I never even heard of before this movie came out.

I will say here that this is the first movie I've ever seen that even though it ""steals"" ideas from other movies, it still manages to retain its own uniqueness.

The relationship between the boy's immediate family put me in mind of Home Alone.  The uncle's red neck rudeness and his family's dire straights was right out of National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation...not to mention the burning Christmas tree (minus the cat).  The spurned letter to Santa...anyone remember Disney's One Magic Christmas?  The devilish gingerbread men was an awesome idea...and imaginatively animated...just like the Gremlins.  The Krampus bell - there goes the Polar Express!

When Krampus is unleashed, rolling black clouds literally crawl over the neighborhood, bringing with them freezing temperatures, a blinding blizzard, foreboding snowmen, and a host of un-Christmas-like creatures.  Consequently, the young boy and his family learn the consequences of a bah-humbug attitude!

There were a couple of disappointments, which was why I didn't give the movie 5 stars.  During the most intense scenes, I had the feeling that the actors were either tired or bored (maybe they had to repeat the scene too many times?), but they didn't seem to be as scared as I think most of us would be in the same situation.  And the depiction of the large toys....for. some reason, it made them appear more clumsy than scary...  I think it would have created a more sinister mood had the toys been normal-size, with a sinister appearance.  Sometimes subtlety comes across as more scary, but that's just me.

Still, those aspects didn't spoil the movie.  It's definitely worth seeing, if you enjoy that type of movie.",1481155200,2,3069,5.256673511293634

6786733,3,B00P2LVW9K,"Re-watching this movie on Blu-Ray after seeing it in theaters, I was very disappointed. Krampus starts strong, with family holiday hell reminiscent of Home Alone, and goes into a strong second act of monster toys on par with Joe Dante's best. The effects, creature design, cinematography are all top notch, and the unexpectedly star-studded cast is admirably game. But it all falls apart in the third act. The resolution of the plot becomes immediately apparent, the CG effects can't hold a candle to the practical effects shown earlier in the movie, and it's just a slog until the inevitable ""But it was all a dream... OR WAS IT?"" ending. Even the Krampus puppet seems off at this point- Krampus opens its mouth to reveal a horrible tongue when it first appears, but when it shows up again at the end the thing's mouth is just slack and gaping, like they were going to CG the tongue in but ran out of budget.

Didn't bring myself to watch the ""alternate ending"" or ""feature commentary"" yet, on the theory of ""fool me twice."" On a technical note, the Blu-Ray did not function on my Samsung blu-ray player, and I watched the DVD instead.

The build up to something bigger coming was something I felt the whole film. A part that a lot of people liked that I didn't were the Gingerbread Men. It felt a little too silly, and lasted longer than I felt it should have. The characters are more or less set up so you don't feel bad for them when something happens. Trick r Treat did this except better. The characters here feel a bit flat, and do nothing to really advance the plot, they are more just sitting ducks that constantly argue with each other. The days of the advent calendar reminded me somewhat of the plagues, just replace fire with snow and frogs with gingerbread men. The story still is interesting, I will have it on my yearly watch list for sure.",1479254400,3,891,4.341317365269461

6786769,5,B00P2LVW9K,"Ok, I swore I wrote a review here.  No?  Then here we go!  I absolutely love this movie.  I fell in love it when I saw the trailer.  Then I saw the movie all alone in a theater house on a slow Tuesday afternoon.  Simply wonderful!  The first 20 minutes introduce the family.  And whoa boy... they remind me of my Christmases at my granny's house on Christmas!  Almost literally.  We would always get together.  We'd tolerate each other.  We didn't always get along, but we all really love each other... and this very rotten family is very similar.  Now the more I watch the movie the more details I find.  From all the German cookies and pastries in the kitchen to everything else.  This is not a horror movie.  This is a Christmas movie first, and a Christmas movie when it ENDS.  That is very key here.  Trying so hard not to spoil anything, but no one is getting 'killed'.  Don't be deceived by everyone else.  The ending is a twist on a twist... it is NOT what you think.  Had we had any idea the family was where the audience is shown they are... the family would be shown where they were.... we did not get that from this movie AT ALL.  They aren't THERE PEOPLE!  They survived because Max does not make the same mistake Omi made!  She only knew half of the legend because of what her experience was!  I found this movie completely captivating and a fresh change from all stupid warm and fuzzy crap made for TV Christmas movies my wife watches every Christmas season... yuck.  So this will be MY mainstay to watch along with Gremlins, A Christmas Story, Christmas Vacation, and Emmett Otter's Jugband Christmas.  If only the language had been toned down a tad... this would be the PERFECT creepy, dark, Christmas movie for all to enjoy and scare the pants to straighten out your kids!  Barely any blood, no real killing.  I put this movie in the same vein as Christmas Vacation meets Willy Wonka.

After Max's loses the Christmas spirit.  He rips up his letter to Santa just after cursing his entire family!  The ENTIRE family!  Not even Max realizes his mistake until after Omi talks about why she has a hard time keeping her chin up every Holiday.  After her story Max begins to think everything is his fault.  When the Krampus's minion start picking off the family one by one to take them... who knows where... Max may have to take a stand against the oldest evil in world to get them back.  With great humorous moments and tense situations... each scene becomes more and more tense as they all seem obviously being picked off one by one.  WHO?  Asks Aunt Dorothy.  Once you're taken you'll know.  Whether you think they are trapped or not may just show what kind of personal attitude you have.  Even the villains are pouring with personality!",1478736000,2,2752,4.4787878787878785

6786773,4,B00P2LVW9K,"I purchased Krampus knowing nothing of real substance about the film.  I was aware of the legend of the ""real"" Krampus and knew that this film was a comedy/horror, but that's pretty much it.  My son was insistent that we get this film because he wanted to prove to me that he could watch a scary film and, like a big boy, go on about his day-to-day life without be afraid.

Well, the film is very good.  It's enjoyable enough that I'll add it to my regular rotation of Christmas AND Halloween films, but it seems to have a little trouble deciding whether or not it wants to be truly scary or truly funny.

It starts out like a standard Christmas family comedy:  Disliked relatives are coming over for their annual holiday visit.  As soon as they arrive they cause chaos.  There's an uneasy truce amongst the family until one of the host family youngster's wish list to Santa is read out loud at the dinner table and he gets into a fight with his cousins over it.

This standard set up is funny.  Adam Scott and David Koechner carry the first half of the film, taking their respective dry and loud styles of humor to very enjoyable levels.  After the young boy (Emjay Anthony) tears up his list and tosses out into the wind, declaring his hatred for Christmas all the while, the film takes a decidedly darker and spookier turn.

The first family victim, despite being a standard know-it-all teen character, is innocent enough, but the fact that this character is attacked first sets the tone for the rest of the film.  Essentially, it lets the audience know that NO ONE is safe in the film, and Krampus and his minions continue to terrorize and carry off victim after victim until the climax of the film.

While the humor is still present in the second half of the film (primarily through the actions of Conchata Ferrell), it takes quite a few steps back from the horror aspects of the movie.  Writers Todd Casey, Michael Dougherty (who also directed), and Zach Shields take innocent standards from Christmas films (think teddy bears, jack-in-the-boxes, cherubs, etc.) and turn them into devices of terror.  Depending on your own perspective of these things, you'll either laugh (which I do believe is the point to a degree) or be scared.  I laughed, a lot, but Dougherty amped up the horror just enough to make these silly-looking creatures genuinely creepy, and I believe that most younger audiences members will take away from these monsters.

When Krampus makes his final move against the family, one member takes a stand against him.  I won't tell you what happens, but it's a pretty decent ending to the film.  I do, however, highly recommend the slightly different alternate ending that makes the film better in my mind.

Overall the film is very enjoyable.  The cast is excellent and the scares are solid.  My wife cringed throughout one entire sequence that involved a cherub.  The film is also very funny.  I do sort of wish that the film would have taken a more solid route in either the comedic or horrifying direction, but I can understand why they tried to find a happy medium.

You better be good for goodness' sake!",1478476800,12,3130,4.635208711433757

It was like ""Goosebumps, mixed with Freddy Kruger, Mixed with an innocent holiday hallmark movie & A Christmas Carol"" into one. BAM You got Krampus!
I'll probably never watch again.. But It did keep me on the edge of seat.
Maybe I can use this theme for Halloween since I'm one of those Christmas freaks who like to bug my neighbors and decorate way to early!! And decorate Krampus style!  At Least Im getting my decor up!

6786829,4,B00P2LVW9K,"Young Max wants a normal, happy Christmas this year. He's young enough to believe in Santa Claus and write him a letter but old enough to have doubts and get pushed in the wrong direction. His older sister is more interested in hanging out with her boyfriend than the rest of the family. His dad isn't traveling this Christmas but is still taking calls from work. His mom is trying to make everything perfect (you know how that goes). When Aunt Linda shows up with her family and Great-Aunt Dorothy (the one with the drinking problem who doesn't like kids), stress levels go off the scale. His bratty cousins discover his letter and read it aloud at dinner. The letter is heart-felt and Max asks Santa to fix the family problems, which he enumerates frankly. Everyone is embarrassed and Max goes nuts. He runs off to his room where he tears up the letter and wishes his family was just gone.

Too bad Krampus, the ancient demonic spirit of Christmas, was listening. A blizzard knocks out the electricity, heat, and phones. Max's German grandmother (on his dad's side) tries to keep things on an even keel, serving hot chocolate and keeping the fire extra hot. She knows about Krampus and tries to stave off the inevitable without saying anything, but that doesn't work for long. Big sister wanders off into the storm to check on her boyfriend and doesn't come back. Some mysterious and creepy snowmen appear in the yard. All the neighbors (except the boyfriend) have left town for Christmas, so no help there. Sister doesn't come back, things start going bump in the night, and the classic knock-em-off-one-by-one routine starts. Can the family pull together before they are torn apart (maybe even literally)?

This premise could have made a pretty low-grade derivative horror film. Gremlins and The Nightmare Before Christmas both present a bleak experience of Christmas made darker by a fantasy element. This movie manages to crank up the bleakness. The bitter and snarky interactions between the family members make the movie uncomfortable and horrifying even before monsters start showing up. The dysfunctionality of the family leads to Max losing faith in Christmas. He then has the most dysfunctional Christmas ever. Santa Claus is replaced by Krampus. Presents turn evil. Gingerbread men become agents of destruction. The movie has a similar level of imaginative creativity as Gremlins and Nightmare Before Christmas and shares the comedic vibe of the other two films. But it also stands out as its own work.

If you're looking for a horror movie for Christmas that's not too bloody (certainly much less than Gremlins) and has some imagination (though not as much as The Nightmare Before Christmas), this movie fits the bill.",1474416000,,2732,4.947712418300654

6786835,4,B00P2LVW9K,I saw Krampus in the theater it's opening night and wasn't quite sure what to make of it at the time. It was very different. I enjoyed it but felt disappointed at the same time due to the fact that I thoroughly loved Michael Dougherty's amazing Trick r Treat and Krampus wasn't as good. When I saw it a second time however I enjoyed and appreciated it a lot more. While it's still not quite the status of Trick r Treat or Gremlins (which is a film Krampus pays loving homage to) it's still a very good and even scary Christmas horror comedy. The main problem I had with the movie is that I didn't care or particularly like any of the characters so I didn't care what happened to any of them. The movie is very creative and is a great movie to watch as a double feature after the classic Gremlins during Christmas eve. I don't really understand why Dougherty decided to make the movie PG-13 instead of R. It's way too intense for younger children and almost borders on R anyways. Bottom line Krampus is worth checking out.,1474243200,,1021,4.350785340314136

6786867,4,B00P2LVW9K,"This is a difficult movie to categorize because it has such a slow build-up.  For a good portion of the first of the film (over 3 hours though it doesn't seem that long), it merely looks like one of those holiday movies passing for comedies which really aren't. As soon as Max tears up his letter to Santa, everything changes. It does have its shock moments and a few jolts along the way.  There are lulls when everything seems to begin to level out and return to normal, and then a second wave of fright will hit.

It's also difficult describe in a few sentences.  I suppose it might be summed up as a cautionary tale against clinging too much to childhood memories as one grows older and being careful what you wish for, in case, as did young Max, you may get it. This is one movie I truly believe the viewer won't know what to expect next, and it may have a good many of us thinking seriously about calling off that next holiday family gathering if it means we have to endure people we wouldn't associate with the rest of the year...especially if doing so might make Santa's Evil Twin come calling.

I also recently learned about the Krampus from some Europeans, and thought the tales of an evil satyr like thing taking naughty children off around Christmas time was both terrifying and hilarious.  Forget coal, we should continue this tradition in the US. Scare the bejesus out of kids.  Anyway, the  terror comedy aspect was what appealed to me from the trailers, but the movie's plot line was lacking.  I just felt they could've done so much.  It seemed more like they hear the legend and decided to make a movie off of the idea rather than researching and teaching us the legend.

6786942,2,B00P2LVW9K,"Each year around Christmas, Im often searching for something a little different.  Like many people, Ive seen just about every version of A Christmas Carol and Its A Wonderful Life numerous times.  The cynic in me comes out once and a while, so I might go for Bad Santa.  Although this film did come out in December, I was trying to focus on potential Oscar nominees, so this had to wait until now.  I figured maybe Id save it for another Christmas in the future.

The film has eye opening beginning.  Scores of shoppers are rushing various big box stores like a heard of elephants escaping a fire.  People are getting knocked out of the way and fights are the norm.  It is pretty funny, especially over a soundtrack featuring Bing Crosby singing Christmas carols.  But we all know it might as well have been archived news footage.  Tom and Sarah (Adam Scott and Toni Collette) appear to be well-to-do parents of a pair of cute kids.  Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen) is about 16 and typical of her age, mostly focused on seeing her boyfriend.  Her younger brother Max (Emjay Anthony) still believes in Santa and has even written him a letter of his wish list, yet to be mailed.

The family is about to be set upon by Sarahs sister Linda (Allison Tolman), her husband Howard (David Koechner) and their brood of 3 unruly kids, one baby, one bulldog and a surprise addition, a disliked aunt (Conchata Ferrell).  When the 2 girl cousins (jokingly referred to as wannabee boys) tease Max about his Santa fixation, Max rips up his letter and throws it out the window of a snow covered freezing night.  You know just like anyone would do with waste paper.  Throw it out the window.

Well that begins a night of terror and torment as the act turns on the evil anti-Santa known as Krampus.  Krampus isn't alone either.  He has his own collection of weirdos, including a larger than life clown, a sharp-tooth bear and some nasty gingerbread cookies.  This mess by Michael Dougherty (Trick r Treat) mixes comedic elements with drama, horror and the importance of family relationshipsand does it very badly.  What you get is a film that isn't funny, scary or heart-warming.  For a much better film about an anti-Santa character, check out Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale from 2010.",1467936000,,2262,4.644836272040302

When Krampus finally makes his appearance you will only see him briefly and under very dark lighting.

I own both Gremlins 1 and 2 and they are a couple of my favorite movies. This is like Gremlins, but without the heart, entertainment factor, or scares.

But if you're looking for a reasonably entertaining horror/comedy that skewers traditional Christmas films then Krampus will be up your alley.krampus dvd

The Engels are a well-to-do family living in an upscale suburb. Their hopes for a peaceful Christmas are dashed by the arrival Sara Engels (Collette) sister Linda (Tolman), her redneck husband Howard (Koechner), their brood of obnoxious kids, and perpetually complaining Aunt Dorothy (Ferrell). The exasperated Engels struggle with their house guests and after his two cousins tease him incessantly over his belief in Santa Claus, Max tears up and throws away his letter to St. Nick.

The absence of the Christmas spirit draws the attention of something else other than Santa. Krampus, the reverse-Santa if you will, descends upon the subdivision with his own style of malevolence. Soon a blizzard wipes out the power and phone lines and blocks the roads out, leaving them prisoners in their own home. The Engels grandmother warns them to keep the fire going at all times but when the fall asleep and allow it to burn out, the house comes under attack by Krampus and his minions. Grandma Omi relates that she had encountered Krampus as a young girl and watched as the demon dragged her parents to Hell. The family now finds itself in a desperate fight with Krampus elves and demon-possessed toys.

Krampus draws inspiration from some of the more well-known Christmas films such as Home Alone and Christmas Vacation but puts a dark twist on them. Koechner, as brusque, redneck Howard is channeling Randy Quaids Cousin Eddie from Christmas Vacation and takes over every scene that he is in. Ferrell, best known for her longtime role as housekeeper Berta in Two and a Half Men, once again brings her acerbic tongue to the forefront as Aunt Dorothy who never has a good thing to say about anything. Outside of these two, however, none of the rest of the cast is particularly interesting.

Director Michael Dougherty doesnt spend much time on the traditional myths of Krampus but rather just speeds right into a full scale assault on the Engels home with menacing snowmen and killer elves. Rather than punishing kids for bad behavior, this Krampus seeks to take out his wrath on those who have lost their Christmas spirit.

Credit the director for not taking the easy way out and giving viewers a Norman Rockwell ending. In point of fact the family and little Max does everything they can to redeem themselves but in a Twilight Zone style twist, they don't exactly get what they wanted for Christmas.

However, this movie seemed to fall flat. It hovered right on the border of being truly scary without ever approaching it head on. The costume designs for the minions of Krampus were kind of spectacular and horrifying - so that was cool. And there were some pretty horrific, gross-out death moments.

6786996,4,B00P2LVW9K,"Krampus is a good addition to your Christmas themed DVD viewing. It's a movie that relies mostly (or maybe all) on puppets and people wearing masks and costumes instead of the usually used these days CGI.  Basically it revolves around the dark spirit of Christmas, if you've lost your faith in giving, make fun of kids who still believe and are just after what you can get from the holiday, well then your going to get Krampus and his minions of various elves and festive creatures such as evil gingerbread men paying you a visit.  I have to say though that although the puppet creatures looked quite cool, some lacked much of a personality, such as the big mouthed clown.  Gremlins and other films of the 80's that used puppets, the characters had personalities, that why you loved them and bought merchandise and figures of them. Most of this film's ones just get angry when their human victim fights back. I don't know that I'd be rushing to buy any of the creatures from this if they came out as figures.

I also thought the movie took too long for us to encounter any of these things.  The film is only an hour and half long yet out first encounter is when Beth is trying to get to her boyfriend's house half an hour in.  We knew bad stuff was going to happen to this family, we could have started the fun after ten, fifteen minutes at the most and therefore had more creature interaction.  The ending (which I won't give away) was pretty weak, you'll know when you get there.  But Krampus is a lot of fun once it gets going, it just could have been so much better with a decent ending and more personality with the creatures though.",1466726400,,1638,4.4186046511627906

Massively misjudged are elements like killer animated gingerbread men and the look and action involving other magical creatures like elves. They should have stuck to one main evil character of Krampus and made him more frightening, by the time he makes a proper entrance I was bored and disappointed that he looks like an unfortunate stunt man was put on stilts and a fat suit with a cheap plastic mask. Finish it off with a cop out ending and you have the recipe for a perfect mess.

The movie does have its moments once it gets going, and some of the relationships are great.  The characters are great in that fact that we get to see them transform at least a little, and they almost make up for the crazy slow movie opening.  It almost feels a little like the Horror Christmas sequel that Christmas Vacation 2 should have been.  Imagine before Randy Quaid went crazy a great tale of a gun toting Uncle Eddie and Clark trying to save the day, would have been perfect.

2015; Running time 1 hour, 38 minutes
Starring: Adam Scott, Toni Collette, and Emjay Anthony; Directed by: Michael Dougherty

A bickering family experiences a power outage on Christmas.  The daughter decides to go out in the storm to check on her boyfriend, and is attacked by an unseen creature.  Eventually, worried that she hasn't returned, two of the men go out to search for the daughter, and find the boyfriend's house in disarray.  The family barricades themselves inside the house, where grandma explains that they are being tormented by a demonic spirit called Krampus that punishes those who are bad at Christmas.  This movie can't decide if it wants to be a comedy or a horror movie, but it gets the balance just right.  The opening sequence, depicting shopping chaos at the mall, is especially amusing.  Emjay Anthony, who plays ""Max"", steals the show, and is a star in the making.  The ending is very trippy and unique. but the final shot is marred by a cheap scare.",1465776000,2,987,4.798816568047338
6787050,5,B00P2LVW9K,"I hate horror films because they're often filled with gratuitous, stupid, and senseless violence. Unlike most horror films, Krampus has a lot of heart, a beautiful (grandma's) story, and a solid message about what really matters in life. There are next to no jumpscares, which I appreciate since horror films with them are cheap trash imo. It's a film that you can get together to enjoy with 13+ year old friends and family around the holiday season. This is not a movie for demented and dead souls wanting to fantasize about murder.

It's like the took The Mist and combined it with Christmas Vacation, except they left out all the scares and laughs.  Seriously folks, I have literally watched hundreds of horror movies, mainstream, Indie, foreign, low budget, big budget and this was one of the worst. The premise, while a good one, is laid out in such a humorless, emotionless, mess, that I had to literally stop myself from throwing the remote at the TV.  Please whatever you do avoid this dreck, instead  if you want to watch a great evil Santa movie rent the Finish movie Rare Exports, it, unlike Krampus, is a truly fun, scary and well made  black comedy.",1465689600,4,809,4.476190476190476

The main family other than the lonely boy who wanted his 'normal ' family back, was very hard to like... When the anti- Clause creature makes his first appearance though, then the movie gets good, but the comedic elements at times override the horror attempts, esp. with some of his minions, using christmas cookies, toys and a teddy bear and turning them into vicious weapons, but the creators recognized this concept and instead of going too far in one direction or the other, they mixed both genres almost perfectly.

Ok, this was emtertaining, no question.  I loved the German grandmother and the tomboy cousins and of course Max.  It's fun horror.  No gore but some jumpy scares.  The angel was definetly creepy, the gingerbread men were hilarious.  I liked how the snowmen represented how many were captured but was a bit perturbed when the numbers started growing for no reason. Ok this is where it started to bug me.  It doesn't exactly hold to the stories of Krampus.  It doesn't even hold on entirely to the story the grandmother says.  the legend goes if your good Father Christmas will reward you but if you misbehave Krampus will come down, give you a scratch, put you in his sack and then on Christmas Eve night he will cast you away to a firey place below.  I've also heard a little song where he ""makes you a snack"" (eats you).  Ok to vary from that is one thing but in this movie he just sorta gets everybody,  The delivery guy, the baby, the sweet German grandma, the unselfish little boy who didn't even ask for presents but instead only for good things to happen for his family members.  Krampus wasn't at all particular.  Mother Teresa could have been in that house and he would have gotten her all the same.  To me that was unexpected but also confused the point of it all.",1464998400,,1294,4.4743589743589745

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

We have a large extended family who comes together at the holidays and the majority of them are such terrible people that you are just waiting for them to get taken out, even some of the kids.  The villains in this movie are evil gingerbread men, evil toys, bizarre looking ""elves"" demented looking snowmen, and of course the evil Krampus.  The costumes look pretty cheesy but at the same time they are creepy looking as well.  They scare you and make you laugh.

One by one the family members are killed off by Krampus' minions in different ways that are both scary and funny as well.  In the end the kid who made the wish to have ""Christmas the way it used to be,"" is the last one alive to be taken by Krampus.  We also get what seems to be the ended where ""It was all a dream.""  But instead it turns out that the family is trapped in a snow globe by Krampus and they will probably live out the perfect Christmas over and over again for eternity.

The movie overall was bad and shouldn't be seen in theaters, and if you really want to see it, rent it from Redbox or from a streaming service like Amazon Prime or Hulu, or something like that.

The family gathered around excited for a late night movie to kick off a short vacation. We never finished the movie. We thought it was going to be a horror, or at least a mildly scary movie. It turned out to be a lackluster dark comedy. We did like two of the characters, though--the youngest boy and his grandmother. And some of the special effects--especially the heavy, hopeless, blizzard atmosphere--at least were momentarily captivating. But overall, we were so unimpressed we stopped the movie with 27 minutes left. It's obvious how it ends--and this was implicit, unfortunately, even before the intended dark action began. The ominous Arctic atmosphere (about the best storm scenes we've seen in a long while), the likable kid, and the relatable grandmother, even though the latter two still struck us as two-dimensional characters, saved the movie from being plainly horrible.

I'd give two stars, but I'd feel guilty about it.  This is sooooooooooooo not a film for kiddies, pre-teens.  Too scary for them to not get their psyches jerked in a bad way.  There were scares in this for me merely because all the tricks of ""scary movies"" are used well enough to trigger the well-worn patterns inside me and arouse some fear, but only because I am so ready to be thusly spurred.

Meanwhile I can't see any kid above twelve being scared or scarred by this; I suspect they'd laugh at it because its sensibilities are so old school compared to today's CGI shudder fests.  Nice to see some decent B-actors in a troupe doing esprit de corps despite the obvious weaknesses of the production.

I don't want a future me to see this again.",1463616000,,1065,4.513089005235602

The funniest part of the movie is the opening scene. After that, you get a whole lot of family drama till the creature known as Krampus starts messing everything up. It's honestly not a bad movie though. I would be creeped out too knowing I'm stuck indoors with family I don't get along with and being hunted by gingerbread men, et al. The message behind this movie is good and I like that it's based on the mythical European creature. The scene that gives the background of Krampus is cool too. Other than that, I wasn't scared and it didn't make me laugh. So to me, what it's billed as, fails. But as I said it's not a bad movie at all and worth seeing at least once.

6787231,3,B00P2LVW9K,"The movie itself was fun and very much in the spirit of 80's horror. I bought the Bluray hoping for some really good behind the scenes material and especially commentary. In the end I can only say this much about it. If you ever were curious what it's like to listen to a bunch of hipsters smelling their own farts, then complimenting themselves on how edgy their own fart was compared to others. Discussing the same fart for 25 minutes and then remembering ""Oh wait, we're watching our movie."" Then this is the commentary track for you. Literally, not figuratively. But literally the biggest waste of time. The smug was so palpable it stayed with me for a week after hearing it. It includes such gems at ""So that scene that we passed a long time ago, there's interesting things but you can go back and find it yourself. If you have the time."", ""Oh did we miss that already?"", and the most boring discussion on how PG13 horror films are just as scary, and if you don't agree then you're just sad.

The movie is fun. The commentary gave me the want and need to find these men and slap them because they need it. Everything else is 'alright'",1462752000,,1139,4.423809523809524

6787233,4,B00P2LVW9K,"I saw this movie right before Christmas last year and it was definitely an instant classic with me and for everybody else. Everything coming out during the Christmas holiday and sappy and really cheesy and we could all use a break from all of the Christmas music too! Anyway, I loved the story and not many horror movies come out during this time too. Granted, it is PG-13, I know it's a little light on the horror but it still has some scare factor in it. I guess they didn't want anything super heavy during the holidays. Anyway, my verdict? A definite must have for your movie collection.

Story - B (I didn't really like the ending that much but like I said, I guess they wanted to keep it light for the holidays)
Special Effects - B+ (Good, nothing over the top but a good combination of puppetry and CGI)
Language - Moderate (Some colorful words but use discretion when watching with your kids)

6787240,5,B00P2LVW9K,"This is a very awesome, yet strange movie. It starts out as a comical dysfunctional Christmas family movie...Then it becomes dramatic and dark. Later it has a mix of both humor, and drama combined. It is hard to fully describe this film because it feels like a gambit of different movie genres combined. Sometimes it'll make you laugh, but when the serious drama kicks on, I almost felt weird for laughing at all during this movie..
THE MESSAGE:
(1) be careful what you wish for
(2) Remember to keep love, kindness, and hope with you, other wise you will be consumed by the darkness, which is Krampus

WHAT THE MOVIE IS LIKE:
If you mixed a monster movie, with a twisted Christmas fairy tale,  with the Gremlin movie, with the Nightmare Before Christmas Movie (the bizarre toys), with Demonic Toys, with a helping of originality, then you have the movie Krampus

THE FLAWS:
Yes the movie was wonderful, and on many levels original, but it also had some flaws. (1) The one that jumped out to me was why did the grandmother have to stay and face Krampus? She did nothing to try and save her family, all she did was stare at him...and what kind of son leaves his 70 year old mother to face a demon??????????
THE GENRE
I would never call this a horror movie....there is very little blood, and really no gore. It is more of bizarre/ dark/ comical film.  This movie is not for children, It is more of a 13 year and older film.

THIS MOVIE IS PERFECT FOR
This movie is perfect for people who love strange/ original dramatic films. Also, for people who are just sick of the sappy holiday themes that most Christmas movies have. If you're tired of Christmas, or want something darker to watch during the holidays, then this is  a great film to watch.

SIDE NOTES:
When I first saw Krampus' face I was surprised how it didn't move. However, I watched the behind the scenes part and I discovered that the face you see is not his. It is infact the face of a dead man that Krampus wears over his own....interesting.

THE STORY:  A boy losses his belief/ love of the Christmas season, and it is all due to his dysfunctional family. The boy tares up his letter for Santa, and throws it out the window. Due to the boy losing his love/ belief in comes Krampus. Krampus abducts the boys entire family. He does this with the help of his helpers, which are demonic elves, creatures which suck people under the snow, a killer teddy bear, a psycho tree angel, and  a demented jack in the box...with the help from some killer gingerbread man cookies. In the end all is not well... remember, ""Krampus does not give, he only punishes and takes"".....

AWESOME MOVIE!

What starts out as Home Alone meets Tales from the Crypt ends up being nothing more than a low-budget version of The Puppet Master's Christmas Special, and if you have seen any of the Puppet Master films, you understand the significance of the critique.  In fact, the only frightening elements in this celluloid disaster is a definitive toss up between its horrid acting and utterly silly practical effects.  I usually criticize for utilizing too much CGI, but, sheesh, this film could have used a healthy helping of it.  The story and concept aren't bad, in fact, the initial notion is actually quite unique and enticing.  However, the execution is so abysmal that any potential is swiftly engulfed in a blizzard of bad.  There is no credible character development or any that you care about.  The humor is stale and lazy, and the action is so predictable and poorly choreographed, it ends up being, quite by accident, the only laughable facet in this horror flick gone horribly wrong.

6787265,5,B00P2LVW9K,"If you are unfamiliar with Michael Dougherty's style of films please watch the awesome Trick R Treat before watching Krampus. Trick R Treat is easily one of my all time favorite Halloween movies. Full of rich visuals, and a quirky but interesting story line. Krampus continues the amazing visuals and quirky story. A little comedy, a few scares and an amazing ending make Krampus the Trick R Treat for the Christmas season.

Another reason I love this film is that Krampus really goes back to the Yules pagan roots. Krampus is well known throughout Europe as St. Nicks evil ""other"". A goat creature that punishes naughty children and drags them to the underworld. He's not as well known in the US but hopefully this film will change that.

Dougherty brings the legend to terror filled life while respecting the characters origins. Round out things with excellent acting, spot on pacing, toss in a dash of Gremlins and you get Krampus. Christmas isn't well known for horror films but Christmas just got a lot scarier.

Another brilliant holiday film from Michael D.

I know there are supposed to be stupid people in horror movies, but sadly all the actors actions once faced by Krampus tends not to make sense. Krampus design is confusing, is it supposed to be Krampus in a Rubber Mask, or if it is Krampus why is his mouth frozen open like a rubber Halloween mask? There are characters in the movie that don't play out, such as the evil snowmen. The movies ending is confusing, and the main child who has lost the Xmas Spirit behavior also makes no sense as he progresses through the movie. Simple things like keeping a fire going, can't be done, and your expected to believe a house full of people are incredibly stupid people, and yes Horror movies are always full of stupid people, but believable stupid people, and not all of them are stupid, but the Krampus Cast is way above being stupid, they are uber stupid.

But the crazy Aunt does drop one F-Bomb, so be aware of that.) About as scary as Gremlins or The Gate (alright, so the Gate hasn't aged well but it was scary back in the day :-P ).

6787273,3,B00P2LVW9K,"Being a fan of the tradition/legend of Krampus, I was really looking forward to this movie.  It never reached our theatres so jumped on the DVD immediately. Even the cover looks enchanting.  But this modern day, light horror, trying to be a Christmas classic went a bit astray.  For anyone who is unfamiliar with Krampus, not enough was explained.  They set it up perfectly having a grandmother who had her own experience with Krampus and being from the old country, but they never delved deep enough into who he is and what he stood for/does and why. Describe the bells, the chains, the whip, the traditions. Don't just show them and leave people hanging.  Also the whole tradition went corrupt with possessed dolls,cookies and evil toys.  No, Krampus isn't about that at all.  I highly recommend reading Krampus, The Yule Lord, by Brom.  Because at the end you are teary eyed and rooting for Krampus, his traditions, the old ways and what we have lost in the commercialism of Christmas and life in general. He allows us to feel our pagan souls again. So, hoping someone else, maybe Tim Burton, will bring about another Krampus movie more true to tradition and leave out the silly parts and even the foul language.  So unnecessary to tell the story.  Three stars for bringing the subject to film, minus the 2 for dragging and not explaining things in detail or touching upon his origins, etc.",1462060800,,1393,4.7190082644628095
6787274,4,B00P2LVW9K,"""Krampus"" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: When his dysfunctional family clashes over the holidays, young Max is disillusioned and turns his back on Christmas. Little does he know, this lack of festive spirit has unleashed the wrath of Krampus: a demonic force of ancient evil intent on punishing non-believers. All hell breaks loose as beloved holiday icons take on a monstrous life of their own, laying siege to the fractured family's home and forcing them to fight for each other if they hope to survive.

The cast led by Adam Scott (as Tom), Toni Collette (as Sarah), David Koechner (as Howard), Allison Tolman (as Linda), Conchata Ferrell (as Aunt Dorothy), Emjay Anthony (as Max), Stefania LaVie Owen (as Beth) & Krista Stadler (as Omi) is pretty good. The directing by Michael Dougherty (who also produced and co-wrote the story & screenplay) is pretty good. The story & screenplay by Dougherty, Zach Shields (also executive produced) & Todd Casey (also co-produced) is pretty good.

The music by Douglas Pipes is pretty good. The cinematography by Jules O'Loughlin is pretty good. The film editing by John Axelrad is pretty good. The casting by Amanda Mackey & Cathy Sandrich Gelfond is pretty good. The production design by Jules Cook is pretty good. The art direction by Alistair Kay, Joe Bleakley & Seth Kelly is pretty good. The set decoration by Daniel Birt, set dressings by Josh Birrell, Mette Lubczyk, Amy Newbury, Hayden Robinson, Tane Jarrett & Thomas Salpietro, set designs by Philip Thomas, Marko Anttonen & Kate Thurston is pretty good. The costume design by Bob Buck is pretty good. The special effects supervised by Brendon Durey, Sven Harens & Alex Falkner is pretty good. The visual effects supervised by Joe Letteri, Ivan Kondrup Jensen, Kevin Andrew Smith & Dan Charbit and coordinated by Chloe Feodoroff, Misato Shinohara, Drew Nielsen & Keith O'Hara is pretty good. The stunts coordinated by Rodney Cook is pretty good. The creature designs by Miguel Ortega, Tran Ma & Aaron Sims is pretty good. The prosthetic make-up effects by Kim Docherty is pretty good.

This is a pretty good, well-made and interestingly entertaining throwback movie that is well-done and well-crafted. Michael Dougherty has co-wrote and directed another holiday horror classic in the making. Adam Scott (as Tom) & Toni Collette (as Sarah) lead a solid cast that is game for the mischief occurring in front of them. This is (or was) one of the better movies that came out during the holiday season (Christmas 2015).",1462060800,,2528,5.0

6787283,5,B00P2LVW9K,"I had to shake my head at some of the negative reviews. People are entitled to their opinions, but no wonder horror is in the state it's in today, where truly excellent films are like rare pearls in a barrel of rotten oysters, while boring rehashes and by-the-numbers template fillers are abundant and successful if they have enough gore, jump scares and heapin' helpings of good ol' fashioned misanthropy.

This film right here is the closest thing there is to a perfect horror movie. It's not the best horror movie. There are many that are better. But this one is lovingly and intelligently crafted to a point where it becomes a paragon of the art of horror movie-making. The story was near perfect, the character development was near perfect, the buildup of atmosphere was near perfect, the horror conventions used were near perfect, the sound - oh, that sound - was perfect and not just nearly so, the editing was near perfect, the effects were near perfect, the score was near perfect, the casting was as perfect as you can get and the performances were terrific.

And don't listen to those calling this a comedy horror. No, this is not a comedy horror, where the two genres are fairly well fused together into a new single whole. This is a horror movie with some very funny scenes and lines, both in content and in delivery. Do NOT go into this thinking that it's a comedy horror if you need films to fit neatly into categories in order to enjoy them. The comedy is not central. It's not the star of the show. It comes from the characters being who they are and the situation being what it is. I laughed out loud at parts, but a good amount of what made me do that is the same thing that makes any truly transcendent horror film work: I liked and cared about the characters. I wanted to know more about them and I wanted to see them succeed. That's the only way for a horror to really work when you've seen as much horror as I have.

There are those (including some who have left reviews here, apparently) who think that horror just kind of _needs_ an R rating in order to be effective. That the only way a horror film can attain a PG-13 rating is to cheapen itself, cut corners, or sell out. That speaks a sad commentary on the state of creativity today, but who can blame them? When Hollywood has sunk to making entire series of movies based on cold data gathered from focus groups, it sets a cultural tone of emptiness. But seeing this film reminded me of something I miss from when I fell in love with movies as a kid - a sense of wonder. It even reminds me of that certain feel Spielburg films had in the 80s, where the protagonist was generally a kid and much of the film is seen through their eyes. Scary things can seem much scarier when you're a child, looking at a frightening world with wide eyes, unsure of how to deal with it. This film fairly effectively gives you an opportunity to feel that through our main character, played admirably by child actor Emjay Anthony. How he views things and how he reacts to them are a very important part of the plot - the main driving device, in fact.

I cannot recommend this enough. I've watched it four times now and will likely watch it many, many more times. There aren't a lot of films I can do that with.",1461974400,16,3267,4.395041322314049

Satan's little helpers weren't all that interesting either. Then there is the liberal stab at gun crazed conservative hillbillies. No movie is complete without it.

Krampus is from the same director of Trick r Treat. Now it is a PG-13 horror film but don't let the rating stop you from giving this film a chance. The basic story is a family full of unlikable people get on the bad side of Krampus, the evil spirit of Christmas & he soon comes for them with an assorted variety of henchmen. The cast is very good & does a good job of making the characters unlikable from the start but towards the end we ending up caring about them & what happens to them. The effects are also well done, especially Krampus who we don't really get a good look at until almost the end. There is even a small animated sequence in the film. Extras include commentary, making of, deleted scenes, alternate ending, trailer. If you are looking for a good & sometimes fun (in a dark comedy sort of way) horror film look no further then Krampus.

Krampus had it's moments the tone of the film-as many have said- is reminiscent of Grimlins with the key figure thundering around on rooftops and one by one reeking bloody vengence?-kinda-on a singular family...weather they where naughty or not...I think someone missed the point of the demon there.

There were lighter moments, quite a bit of tongue in cheek humor-nothing really laugh out loud worthy- which was tension breaking. There was blood, there was gore, there where homicidal gingerbread men! The family was filled with several stereotypes, the red neck in-law, the jerk cousins, the aunt no one can stand chugging egg nog, a sad sack kid who still believes in santa. Honestly the caricatures that made up the family where funny on their own.

All in all my biggest criticisms of this movie come to two points the demonic toys didn't add much and at times felt like a stupid add in.

 I personally loved the story of this movie because it had me drawn in with a combination of family trouble, scary moments, forgiveness, regret, etc. There was plenty of corny creatures that were also somewhat creepy. These creatures made most of the funnier parts of the movie, probably won't be making any gingerbread men this Christmas.

 The ending has a twist and although I won't say what it is, make sure you watch all of the movie til the end.

 Is this okay for kids? Possibly. It really depends on the child. I let my kids watch a lot of movies as long as there is no nudity or sexual talk. I did watch this with my five year old and seven year old sons. They loved this movie and only got mildly scared at a couple scenes but they mostly laughed. There is no nudity but there is some bad language.

He looks more like a weirdly horned Saint Nick than the hairy horned one hoofed Krampus that rides along with Saint Nick to punish the bad. In this he's made the ""shadow of Saint Nick,"" he has his own twisted, demonic, elves. Some parts were good and stuck with the legend, but some parts were out right stupid and had nothing to do with the actual legend. Krampus never demolished a whole village, he punished depending on the severity of the acts, he had a bundle of sticks to whip but could also dragged the true evil to Hell, basing him off the devil himself. The legend of course has been harnessed to that of a lump of coal. It's probably a good thing as the legend is horrific, but I think the point is that there are consequences for being bad and degrees of punishment and rewards for being good.",1460246400,,884,4.357575757575757

6787345,1,B00P2LVW9K,"Awful. God-awful. It's incredible what the studios can do to game the reviews on Amazon. If someone gave this film a 3-star review, I would be suspicious but I could buy it. 4-star review, I'd say they must know someone in the film or someone who worked on set. 5-stars? You're getting paid to write reviews. Period.

Spoiler beyond this point but trust me when I say to save your money. Buy 'Gremlins' instead. Basically the same movie with a much, much better storyline and better acting.

Now on to the criticism:

Here's the main problem with Krampus: it has a story that could've been written by an 8-year old child but it's rated for people over 13. And indeed, I'm not convinced that a child didn't write this with the 'OMG it was all a dream!...or WAS it?!' ending.

As other reviewers have mentioned, it doesn't know what it wants to be so it ends up failing on all levels: as a holiday movie, as a dark comedy, as a horror movie, as a kid's film. In the end it's a hybrid of all of the worst parts of these, yet still defies any real category except for 'bad.' And it pulls that category off very well.

Someone called this an 'indie' film.

Right. Just because it saw little to no success in theaters doesn't make it 'indie.' It had a huge waste of a budget and several-somewhat-famous stars. I hope this isn't the kiss of career death for any of them.

Frankly, if you want a movie that creates tension without plot, just watch a slasher film. In the end, I wish I would've. The storyline is predictable, what little plot exists is full of holes and you know how this is going to end way before it gets there. And when it does end, you're relieved to be honest.

I saw this in theaters and when that point came, there was a giant, collective audible moan from the audience. I was glad I wasn't the only one cringing and rolling my eyes.

I will say this: the bright spot in this trainwreck of a movie is the aunt, played by Conchatta Ferrell. She's a veteran and the abyss between her and the other actors was palpable. Even in a small supporting role for a bad movie, she made her role memorable.

And the effects weren't horrible. Kind of the cliched stuff you would expect (OMG! Killer gingerbread men! OMG!)...something a kid would find exciting. Yet it's not a kid's movie. Apparently written by a kid for kids with a PG-13 rating.

Tragic. From a marketing standpoint, of course. Since the reviews are gamed, they will sell a lot of copies of this in April and by May, I'm guessing the real reviews will catch up and it'll end up with about a 2.5 out of 5 stars, which is still being kind in my opinion.

In summary, your 9 year old male boy would like it but the effects will give him nightmares. Anyone over the age of 13 (for whom it's rated) will see the glaring plot holes and the cringeworthy ending and yell at you for suggesting they watch it.

Ultimately it is the movie Gremlins if Gremlins had a horrible ending. And even though that movie was made in the 80s, the characters were more interesting and effects more genuine. Want a Christmas movie for the whole family with an edge to it? Stick with that. If you've got an older crowd, go with Bill Murray's Scrooged.

You've been warned. Hey, look: I'm just trying to help you make an informed decision about skipping a movie that you'll ultimately wish you hadn't watched, certainly wish you hadn't bought (should you be tempted to do THAT).

Is it appropriate for kids? I don't feel like it's appropriate for any other group with the 'OMG it's all a dream like an entire season of the hit TV show 'Dallas.' Don't do it. Just don't.",1456617600,8,3612,4.38622754491018
6787346,3,B00P2LVW9K,"Perhaps I had higher expectations for this movie, but for me it was a bit of a let down. I'll admit some of the humor was pretty funny and I did enjoy the atmosphere as well as the soundtrack. However, the juvenile way the film was handled disappointed me. Some of it is cute in a Gremlins sort of way, but the giggling CGI gingerbread cookies and the demonic toys, although fun, weren't scary at all. It's like a cross between Gremlins, National Lampoon Christmas Vacation and Poltergeist. More juvenile comedy fantasy than actual horror. When you finally do see Krampus, I found his CGI 'old man winter' look a bit disappointing. I personally found 'A Christmas Horror Story' to be more interesting and geared toward a more mature viewing audience. Plus Krampus looks pretty wicked in that one. Overall, Krampus isn't a terrible movie, it's OK, but not one I'll want to keep for my holiday horror collection.",1456531200,2,910,4.729559748427673
6787347,3,B00P2LVW9K,"Actually I would like to give this a 3 1/2 star review, simply because this is a notch better than 'just ok' but not worthy of four stars in my opinion. What starts off like a re-tread of ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" soon enough becomes a dark, twisted story of what a child can unleash if he / she has lost the Christmas spirit to the point of no longer believing in Santa. In ""Krampus"" a young boy is so  frustrated by the antics of his completely unlikeable relatives that he blames Santa. Bad move for this kiddo as a sudden blinding blizzard knocks out power, putting this definition of family dysfunction together in darkness while a vicious wind howls outside. If that was the only problem facing these folks, that would be one thing, but there's far more than just a blizzard raging outside. There's also Krampus, the anti-Santa if you will, and several seriously evil tag-alongs as well. I will not say anything more, other than what promises to be a pretty cool comedy-horror film, all too soon becomes a ""Gremlins"" re-tread. Imagine if ""Christmas Vacation"" was scripted by Stephen King and then directed by Joe Dante with Steven Spielberg producing and you can pretty much imagine what ""Krampus"" becomes. The ending, while somewhat predictable, is cool and shuddery enough to elicit goose-bumps.

Krampus is a movie that I enjoyed more than I thought I would. The movie has a good story, characters, humor, and some mildly creepy moments. The humor in the film works quite well as the humor is placed in parts that fit well with where it occurs. Is the movie scary? No, not really but I thought the dark setting and atmosphere was effective and the pacing of the movie helps. I liked how some of the effects were done practically and whenever there was CGI, it looked good. Krampus does has its flaws however.

By Christopher Ouellette

I have always found it interesting when Hollywood comes out with an original idea, and then I find out that there are two films with the same idea at the same time. (Twin Films) The Addams Family, The Munsters, and Bewitched all started and ended at the same time. Antz and A Bugs Life. Babe and Gordy. After Earth and Oblivion. And this Christmas, there are both Krampus and A Christmas Horror Story, which advertises a fight between Santa and Krampus. Both were pre-released as VOD, but only Krampus made it to theaters.

First off, they both really live up to their names. A Christmas Horror Story is just that. Its a horror flick with blood, killing, monsters, psychos, and ghosts. Krampus is a straight monster flick. Family trapped in the house with a creature coming for them. It seemed very appropriate that Universal was the distributor.

A Christmas Horror Story is four shorts intertwined. There are teens trapped in a haunted school basement. One family accidently brings home a changeling instead of their child, while another runs from Krampus in the woods. Finally, Santa battles his own elves as a zombie virus infects them all. The stories happen in the same town and are all linked by the local DJ, played by the films big get, William Shatner. As he simply drinks himself into an alternatingly jolly and depressing stupor, he buffers each story.

shatner

There is a very dank feel to everything. Almost grindhouse, with a weirdly obvious avoidance of nudity. (They include a sex scene and a shower scene.) The effects are not the best, but the director knows how to use them. You will jump a couple of times and say eeuww. The Santa stuff is the most fun of the interlaced chapters, but all of them are engaging enough. The strange thing about the film is that it takes the idea that anyone can be the monster to an extreme, as well as being a weird take on repentance. Most movies that deal with monsters have some moral key that saves you. In this film, confessing your wrongs always precedes your death. The only story without a character verbalizing their missteps starts with the standard teen slut character going home and exiting the narrative. The one who bears the brunt of the ghost is the virgin good girl. I could tell there was craft going on, but I was always aware of what they were doing. The filmmakers were putting in scares while turning horror tropes on their ears. I was often surprised by this film, but after, I was just befuddled as to why they did what they did other than to be different. I constantly felt like the movie was trying to tell me something, but I was never sure what. By the end, even the Santa story is robbed of its fun, and the emotional moments it had, felt a bit like a cheat. It also severs the supernatural string I thought was linking the story and chalks it up to coincidence. I think that this would be an entertaining film, but its oddly agnostic nihilism left me feeling blah instead of shocked, haunted, or adrenalized.

So as we walk away from a DJ spinning old yuletide vinyl and drunkenly musing something about being nice to people over the holiday, we turn our attention next to Krampus.

krampvskramp

Where the former develops characters by common horror tropes, Krampus introduces us to stock sitcom characters that we recognize instantly. Still they got the people who play them best on TV to recreate them here, so they are well done stock characters. As I said, this is a monster movie. The child rejects the idea of Santa Claus and gives up hope. This opens the door for Krampus, Santas evil counterpart, to move in.

The feel of this film is not like the live action Grinch, where Jim Carrey played the Grinch and Ron Howard played Tim Burton, but Im sure that Krampuss director, Michael Dougherty, has Batman Returns on his DVR. Actually, from this film I can divine that his collection includes Gremlins, A Charlie Brown Christmas, Coralline, and a couple offerings from non-Kermit Jim Henson works and Rankin and Bass. Still, its never parody or theft but reverent homage that brings up nostalgic feelings. This film seems to be very informed by the world of Christmas specials, starting early on with a clip from a black and white A Christmas Carol.

While the film may not need a lot of editing to put it on TV, the threats still feel very real. I would put it on the level of The Monster Squad in a lot of ways. Most of the creatures are masked, but enough of it is moved to know there is something truly horrifying underneath. This film has great pacing and the actors are all giving it their best. I won't be raving about this but it was fun. Where the last one just told us, its Christmas so you might as well buck up (even though you are all possessed monsters), this has a bit more of an up note about Christmas Spirit, love, and sacrifice. Its sort of the average of the lessons from the most popular perennial Christmas animations. (They even give an animated elf on an iPad Linuss speech.)

 Spoiler 

As we got to the final confrontation, I started really fearing that we were getting to be all a dream and in a way, it was. Though the feeling of a cheat quickly dissipates with the realization that the dream, in a Charles Dickens way, all happened.

In conclusion, it is just ironic that they both came out at the same time. They deliver what they promise. Christmas Horror and Christmas Monsters. Still, Krampus has a bigger budget and thus could get better effects and more seasoned seasonal actors. I also like the straight story and encouraging ending of Krampus",1455840000,,5982,4.862475442043222

Some of the best horror movies are funny! I even think American Werewolf is hilarious but that is just me. Anyway this movie is kinda like those 80s classics. It starts like a typical Christmas movie with a family getting together for Christmas just like National Lampoon or every holiday movie you may have seen.

Then a mysterious red sac full of gifts arrives at their door and a storm unexpectedly comes in so severe that the power goes out. The families are effectively trapped inside with no light and freezing temperatures. Then a sinister force set on punishing them slowly reveals itself, challenging the family to work together or die.

Krampus is the second film by Michael Dougherty who also directed my favorite Halloween film Trick 'r Treat. This film is a great addition to the holiday horror genre, but doesn't live up to its predecessor. The exposition of the film is a bit lengthy, but it's important to establish the characters, their relationships, and really get us to care about what happens to them. Without this, the film would be lackluster. I love the beginning and its cynical yet accurate view of the holiday season. Bing Cosby croons It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas while people brawl it out over Christmas decorations and present. Max also fights with another students onstage at the Christmas play while his classmates teachers and parents look on, horrified. It captures the Christmas feeling to so many: retail rage and spending time with family you hate. It's clear from the beginning that Max's family doesn't see eye to eye on practically anything; they are opposing on everything from political ideology to how to raise their kids to how they liked the food. Their fights just escalate, undeterred by Christmas or the supposed togetherness of the holiday. After they are attacked by supernatural creatures, they grow closer together and are forced to work together for the greater good. At this point, I like the family enough, but they are all kind of awful. I wouldn't mind if they were dragged off by supernatural creatures and killed. Oma, Max's Austrian grandmother, is the best and most sympathetic character in the film and the only one I would have any sort of emotion if they died. However, I did like seeing a realistic dysfunctional family onscreen and exploring their relationships.

My favorite part of the film is Krampus and his variety of monstrous helpers. Krampus himself towers over everyone with huge horns, hooves, long skeletal fingers, and an eerie human face. He wears a huge cloak to obscure his face most of the time, which is no less imposing or frightening than his visage. His helpers include adorably homicidal gingerbread cookies, horrific toys a la Nightmare Before Christmas, unseen sandworms under the snow, evil snowmen, evil Jack-in-the-Boxes, and other masked creatures. The clown Jack-in-the-Box in particular is the stuff of nightmare fuel as it seeks to devour its prey whole. There is no shortage of creative monsters here. Their design pushes the envelope of what is acceptable in a PG-13 horror film because of how truly creepy and disturbing they are. I love Krampus story: how he is the shadow of Santa Clause and comes in to punish a whole village that has lost the Christmas spirit, leaving one lone child survivor to tell the tale to others. The part explaining this story through Oma's memories changes medium and adopts a monochromatic, stop motion style. The change is beautiful with a dash of Edward Gorey and builds the Krampus mythos nicely.

Krampus is a gleefully sinister Christmas movie that I would watch every year along with Gremlins. The only flaw in the film is that Dougherty clearly pulled back what we would usually do to the characters (as seen in Trick 'r Treat) in order to gain a wider audience and a PG-13 rating. It feels a bit watered down, but makes sense with the ending. That said, I hope it opens up more doors for him and helps pave the way for a sequel to Krampus and Trick 'r Treat.",1452384000,3,4173,4.817294281729428

6787374,4,B00P2LVW9K,"While ""Trick R Treat"" is one of my family Halloween movies I certainly had high expectations of Doughertys take on a ""scary"" Christmas movie.

Happily I can report that Krampus delivered. Although slow to start, it builds characters and establishes these mostly awful individuals that you eventually want to see them overcome Anti Santa once he finally shows up. Yes this movie has so many tropes of what a ""B"" film is, but that just adds to the charm of this underrated film. Where else will you see Killer GingerBread cookies? But even despite this being a ""B"" horror movie, I say that with the upmost respect. It's corny and cheesy but in a fun meta way. Even the opening mocking Christmas in America sets the tone of the fun film you are about to watch. And even more surprisingly this film has a heart. Leaving the theatre me and my friends were actually more in the Christmas spirit as Dougherty sets up despicable characters that you ultimately grow to care for and want to root for.

Is it as fun as Trick R Treat? No. But that nessecarily isn't a bad thing. I did wish this was an anthology but I learned after wards a Krampus comic tackled by Dougherty does tell Krampus in more of his original ""Anthology"" pace.

This movie is far from perfect and drags at parts, but it is overall a fun satire on Christmas and probably the best Christmas Horror movie of the last 20 years.

6787375,3,B00P2LVW9K,"Was treated to a private showing of Krampus today. Okay, so it was because everyone else was seeing Star Wars and my boyfriend and I were the only ones in the theater, but anyway.... First, let me say that I LOVE the legend of Krampus. Forget that Elf on the Shelf crap, Krampas will scare your kids straight.

I was excited to see this movie for several reasons. Not only because I love the legend, but it's nice to shake things up and watch something that isn't a heartwarming, feel-good film at the holidays. What's wrong with a little bit of horror at Christmas - or a lot? Unfortunately, this movie had far too little. Some of the scenes were downright hilarious rather than scary. And, by the end I was saying, ""You got to be kidding me."" Though I admit the very last scene will leave you pondering over the film for a few days.

Was it worth the price of a matinee ticket? Sure, but this isn't a film you'll watch year after year. It's best to go into the film knowing that it's more comedy than horror. Sadly, I'm not sure if that's how it was supposed to be. And, this probably goes without saying, but it's not for kids - unless they're being little hellions and need to be scared straight. ;)",1450569600,2,1203,4.31858407079646
6787376,1,B00P2LVW9K,"I really don't understand why so many people like this movie. From the trailer I was expecting to see a horror movie, instead I saw a train wreck wannabe horror-comedy that failed miserably on both counts. The humor barely solicited a mild chuckle (can't even count it as campy humor, it just sucked), and the horror aspect was a complete joke. So much more could have been done with seldom spoken Christmas lore. Poor effects, horrible writing. If I could give negative stars I would. I want my money back!",1450483200,10,507,4.644444444444445
6787377,4,B00P2LVW9K,"Novel approach to the horror/Christmas genre (c'mon, you can't see the similarity between the two?) finds a bickering, embittered family on the cusp of continual dysfunction when the quasi-Uncle Eddie extended family types show up to celebrate the holidays with them--but someone else is on the way for Christmas this year, and he ain't human boy!
Unusual to see this Christmas time horror/mystery film subgenre still flourishing, it most likely happened because the world in today's time feels less safe and more on edge than it has in the past...nonetheless, ""Krampus"" is both fun and suspenseful enough (despite some really unprofessional dialogue writing) that it counts for me...and it is certainly impressive in a visual sense (despite the ""Coraline""-oriented stop motion animation sequence that explains the grandmother's ""history"" with Krampus paying a visit to the family on Christmas night long before he returns for another new nightmare in the present day). ""Krampus"" serves as both a moral warning and a darkly amusing satire, walking a careful line between these two genres. I predicted (correctly?) that the film would be a big hit for this late 2015 season, but apparently Universal decided to waylay the release of the (positive) reviews in advance so a ""major"" box office intake was prevented as a result (isn't this proof of the studio's prejudice against unique films that aren't presold in advance by major marketing research?). Sheesh, take a chance guys, at least once in a while! In any case, this is far better than Michael Dougherty's other low-budget hit ""Trick 'r Treat"" (a movie I've never been crazy about) and it should become a minor cult film on home video eventually. It was pretty creepy in parts, and the narrative is basically straightforward with some comical bits sprinkled atop of it. The cast is actually pretty good overall too.
In the end, you won't learn much about the actual mythology of Krampus himself, and the movie is a basic mainstream and family-friendly horror picture overall, but after years of bright and sunny (and essentially empty) Christmas films, it was nice to see this cinematic variation of Krampus come along to piss on the parade a bit.

Don't walk into this one expecting torture porn or intense gore. It actually reminded me a bit of Gremlins to be honest.

Family, annoying family, love, Christmas Spirit, change of heart, etc  The film has a hard to describe, humorous, Home Alone style tone throughout that works with the more serious horror aspects.  It is a complex foundation that was masterfully built and that ties in all of the holiday themes extremely well; humorous but with weight.  It is not cheesy and it is not generic bland horror.  It is a successful attempt at a sincere, heartfelt holiday film.

This was a true film.  Someone or a group of people had a creative idea and vision.  They took that motivation and followed it through all the way. They used their influences from the past to inspire their own endeavor rather than to reboot, remake, or generally copy something old.

I smiled the entire way through this film and loved every second.  Even walking out of the theater, I just felt great.  Merry you could say, hit with that warm and fuzzy holiday cheer.  I highly recommend that people go see this film.  I would even recommend it as a generally family film (maybe kids 10 and up).  Director, Michael Dougherty, cast, and crew did a really fantastic job.

6787382,4,B00P2LVW9K,"My mom and I greatly enjoy horror films and went to see this last night. When we went in to see the movie, we didn't know there would be comedy involved (and not just comic relief). We loved the comedy and how it further satirized family Christmas like National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. The film is not overly scary, but it does have moments of scare. I knew of Krampus going into the film, but afterward decided to do some research. I do wish Krampus looked more like the one in European lore, but that is my biggest pet peeve. I like that the film was realistic, approachable, and ended with a very important moral. I would go see this again if ticket prices weren't so expensive, but I will definitely buy it on DVD. This film isn't too scary for people who'll easily have nightmares, but it isn't scary enough for the ultimate horror fan. Just enough gore, too. And the comedy is great!",1449792000,7,895,4.463414634146342
6787383,5,B00P2LVW9K,"This was a very fun Christmas horror comedy. They didn't take themselves too seriously and had fun with it. It's very reminiscent of the cheesy horror movies from the 80's and 90's. In a way, this movie comes close to 'Gremlins' This review will contain some spoilers. I loved the opening scene. It gives you a feel of Black Friday and how crazy some people actually get. The beginning really felt like Christmas like the family banter, the decorations, and making Christmas cookies while watching a Christmas movie. Our main character is a young boy named Max who wants Christmas to be like it was in the old days. He gets aggravated when his mom's side of the family come and one of the kids reads aloud the letter he wrote to Santa. He becomes angry and tears the letter into pieces, which causes the Krampus to soon show up and spread some holiday fear. The Krampus was very cool and creepy looking. They don't show him too often, but they make up for it with his demonic toys,  sadistic elves, and adorably possessed gingerbread men. It's up to Max to stop Krampus and save Christmas.
