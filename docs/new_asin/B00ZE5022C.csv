7277108,5,B00ZE5022C,"Weston Woods/Scholastic has been making videos of favorite children's picture books for decades.  This one is a real bargain because you get 20 book stories for less than they normally charge for the ones that have four or five stories.  We bought this DVD for the library where I am the children's librarian.  They love it. This DVD includes:
1 .By the light of the Halloween moon - A little girl is bothered by a cat, a witch, a bat, a ghoul, and more in this sing-songy tale.
2.  The Day of the Dead - a lively explanation of the Mexican holiday the Day of the Dead, featuring guitar playing skeletons. Narrated my Rita Moreno.
3.  Dem Bones - You know the song.  Toe bone connected to the foot bone, foot bone connected to the ankle bone, and so on.  It's sung by dancing skeletons.  This is a big favorite with the children at my library.  You will watch this over and over.
4.  Georgie - an oldie but goodie from the 1940s about a friendly ghost.
5.  Little Old Lady Who Was Not Afraid of Anything -The lady isn't afraid of the creepy shoes, pants, shirt, etc. that follow her in the woods.  Very fun.
6.  Los Gatos Black on Halloween - A Halloween poem with a Spanish flair.  Probably too scary for littler children.
7.  The Wizard - Fun story about a mouse asking the wizard for a magic potion.
8.  Strega Nona -The classic tale of the Italian grandma witch and her helper Big Anthony.
9.  Teeny Tiny and the Witch Woman -Three brothers are caught by a witch in a very scary Turkish story reminiscent of Hansel & Gretal.  Not for little ones.
10.  Very Brave Witch -Not very scary story about a little girl who happens to be a witch.
11.  What's Under My Bed? -  A grandfather tells not too scary bedtime sorties.
12.  Where the Wild Things Are - The classic Sendak book in an animated version that uses the exact text from the book.  This is not the feature film that goes far afield from the book.
13.  Space Case - A space alien is confused when he visits Earth during Trick or Treating.
14.  The Three Robbers - Weird story about three robbers who fill a castle with abandoned children. I've always felt this book is a little disturbing.
15.  Fletcher and the Falling Leaves - It's the first autumn for Fletcher, a little fox.  So when the leaves start falling off his favorite tree he worries that it is sick.
16.  Creepy Carrots - A quirky story about Jasper Bunny, who is afraid of monster carrots.
17.  A Dark, Dark Tale - Classic read-aloud tale about a creepy old house with a not so scary secret.
18.  Dinosaur Bones -Nonfiction look at dinosaurs.  Not sure why this included on a Halloween DVD.
19.  The Trip - On Halloween, Louie dreams about his old neighborhood in the city.
20.  Diary of a Spider - The world from the point of view of a school-age spider and his friends, Fly and Worm.

Strictly speaking, not all these stories are Halloween stories.  The unifying theme is scary stories, skeletons, monsters, and fun.",1462406400,10,2942,4.39517625231911

7277113,5,B00ZE5022C,Great quality. Great stories. My 7yr old God daughter loves picking from the many stories on the dvd to watch. Great to share & watch around the Halloween season. Glad it's apart of my holiday dvds.,1450569600,,198,4.527777777777778
7277114,5,B00ZE5022C,We love all of these scholastic book dvds.  We homeschool and often will have these on during quiet time.  We are collecting the whole series!  What a fun way to enjoy a Halloween themed time!,1450051200,,192,4.428571428571429
7277115,5,B00ZE5022C,"My 3 year old son, 5 year old nephew, and 8 year old niece really liked these stories.  Saw some stories they knew, and lots they didn't.  Great and fun in the car especially!  Highly recommend.",1449014400,,194,4.333333333333333
7277116,3,B00ZE5022C,"The Stories are great all Scholastic titles! problem?  There is no problem if you purchase this DVD for your home use. If you are a teacher or a school this DVD does not come with performance rights, meaning you cannot show this DVD in a classroom or any public place. It would have been nice to know that before I purchased this item. Thankfully I was able to return it easily to amazon.",1448841600,,388,4.315068493150685

7277128,5,B00ZE5022C,great Halloween stories. When I sub I take along in case I need something to do with free time. You can watch one or more than depending on the time you have.,1446940800,,158,3.96875
7277129,5,B00ZE5022C,"Grades 1 and 2 shared this collection during the week before Halloween.  Most of the stories are familiar to them; they enjoyed watching them.  In the future, I'll skip a few of the stories because they don't appeal to 2nd graders.  However, you can't beat the cost!  Quality DVD.  I will purchase the story sets for the other holidays.",1446854400,5,336,4.627118644067797
7277130,4,B00ZE5022C,"Another great batch of books that have been animated. The only reason for the deduction of a star is that about a quarter of the shows don't really reference anything Halloween, Day of the Dead or even spooky. It felt like they were just trying to hit the 20 mark without animating anything new for this disc. Still definitely worth the purchase-be sure to check out scholastics other collections! Two children under 5 both love this and I can see the stories entertaining them for a long time to come. Great offset to our book collection and for only $5, you can't do better.",1446249600,5,576,4.548076923076923

7277132,4,B00ZE5022C,"Cute stories we love the scholastic video storybooks because they are short and we can pair them with the books.  On the downside we were not able to find one of the stories at our local library or here on Amazon, but purchased several of the books to make a fun set for the fall!",1445472000,3,280,4.090909090909091
7277133,4,B00ZE5022C,My 3 year old loves this DVD and asks for it almost daily since we first watched it. He likes that there is a menu structure of the front covers of books where he can choose which one he wants read to him. Some of these videos are old and some are newer. They have all been repackaged nicely though in this set. I'll probably be buying the holiday one soon since the prices are so reasonable.,1445472000,,392,4.103896103896104

7277135,5,B00ZE5022C,"Careful! One of the stories is pretty scary. My 4 year old freaked out! It's a good story, and very well done. Maybe a little too well done for younger kids. The rest of the stories are great!",1445299200,3,192,4.078947368421052
7277136,4,B00ZE5022C,"The price of this set of stories is great, as it provides several hours of entertainment. However, not all of the stories are equally entertaining. Some are older animations from the 70s and 80s which understandably fail to keep my toddler's attention for longer than a minute because of the pale/neutral colors, I'm assuming. So, usually we skip those.

But there are some very fun ones for toddlers: Dem Bones, The Day of the Dead,  Fletcher and the Falling Leaves, Dinosaur Bones, The Little Old Lady Who Was Not Afraid of Anything and a couple more). What these have in common are colorful animations and/or catchy tunes.

Overall, we are satisfied with this Scholastic dvd. '",1444953600,5,680,4.844827586206897

They watch these in the car on the way to appointments every week. I kind of wish the words from the story were in the pictures like a storybook.
