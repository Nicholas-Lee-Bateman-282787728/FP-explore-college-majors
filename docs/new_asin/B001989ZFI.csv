3424747,4,B001989ZFI,"Honestly not all these comedies are actual ""classics"". Some have not held up too well over the years and the humor is more than a bit creaky. But some have held up rather well and others are just so unusual or unlike the comedies that are produced today that they're just plain interesting and fun to watch. Overall this is a good set. Here are a few of the highlights.

GHOST PARADE:  A very quick(18 minutes) little comedy about strange and inexpilcable goings-on at a haunted mansion. It's directed by Max sennet and while not a hidden gem it's fun and fast.

MILLION DOLLAR KID: This is a Bowery boy's movie that puts more emphasis on the laughs. The boys befriend a millionaire after saving him from a mugging, but later they suspect that his no-good son was involved in the robbery. The boys decide to ""wise him up"". It's quick, energetic and fun

MY MAN GODFREY: A ditzy but warm hearted socialite hires a homeless man to work as her eccentric family's butler during the Great Depression. But is there more to the new butler than meets the eye? A genuine comedy classic that pairs William Powell and Carole Lombard.

LOVE, SPEED AND THRILLS: Mack Swain stars as a jealous husband who takes in a wounded hunter, only to become outraged at the hunter's advances on his wife. Before long a chase is underway, and soon after that the Keystone Cops join in. The plot is just an excuse for a pretty funny, extended chase scene. It's a silent film from 1915.

NOTHING SACRED: Possibly the best film in this set, this comedy is sharp, smart and funny. In order to improve his paper's circulation a reporter writes a fake sob story about a woman dying of radium poisoning. He then gets Carol Lombard to play the part of the woman. Things seem to work out until an Austrian doctor discovers Carol is faking. It's breezy, chatty and loose and stands up as a great comedy in any generation.

ROAD TO BALI: Another genuine comedy classic. This is one of the great ""Road"" movies of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. The guys have to scram out of Australia to avoid a shotgun marriage and end up working as divers on a Pacific island, competing for Dorothy Lamour and with crooked treasure hunters.

SMALLEST SHOW ON EARTH: A real ""sleeper"" this is a British comedy about a young couple that inherits a rundown little movie theater and the eccentric staff that works there. It's leisurely paced, witty and character based comedy and stars Peter Sellers as the drunken projectionist.

CLANCY STREET BOYS: More fun with the Bowery Boys, this one is pretty much a straight out comedy. Mugs gets the gang to pose as his brothers and sister (poor Glimpy) in order to impress his Uncle Pete, visiting from Texas. It's not what you'd call witty, urbane or even smart, but it is a lot of fun.

ANGEL ON MY SHOULDER: Paul Muni is a hard-boiled gangster who literally goes to hell. Claude Raines is a smooth Devil who will cut Muni a deal if he goes back to Earth and ruins the name of a good and upright man. Ann Baxter is the monkey wrench. Sounds like a drama and it is, but it's kind of a ""comedy-noir"". It's also a great romantic comedy.

THREE GUYS NAMED MIKE: Jane Wyman plays a breezy stewardess who is pursued by....three guys named Mike. It's a 50's romantic comedy that is fairly funny but is most interesting as a look at what 50's air travel was like.

THE STOLEN JOOLS: Believe it or not, this unique all-star comedy short was financed by a tobacco-producing company in aid of a tuberculosis charity! Half of Hollywood circa 1931 puts in an appearance here during its mildly enjoyable but thoroughly fascinating 18-minute run. There's a jewelry store robbery that ends up involving such stars as Buster Keaton, Laurel & Hardy(as a team of detectives), Edward G. Robinson, Wallace Beery, several of the Little Rascals,Hedda Hopper, Barbara Stanwyck, Gary Cooper, Gabby Hayes and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. to name a few.

THE FRONT PAGE: Hildy Johnson is an ace reporter who wants to retire from the news game and marry his sweetie. Walter burns is the shrewd, manipulative editor who needs Hildy to help break the scoop of the century, It's a funny and also biting critique of politics, reporting and society and it still holds up well today. It's fast-paced, quick witted, very smart and a contender for best movie in the set.",1288915200,45,4310,4.603650586701434

Exceptions are ""Ghost Parade"" and ""La Cucaracha,"" which don't appear on either set. Also, the groups of shorts that were once called ""Festivals"" (Buster Keaton, Keystone Kops, Stan Laurel, Fatty Arbuckle and Our Gang) are here detailed as individual movies, thus bringing the total film count up to 116.

Transfer quality of MCE's public domain movies is uniformly good. Their dual-side recorded discs usually contain two titles per side and are housed in gloss-coated heavy paper sleeves. Easy access storage boxes are sturdy and remarkably compact. A small percentage of these are obviously dubbed from broadcast TV, thus you may see the ""In Stereo Where Available"" logo at a movie's outset or notice brief black spaces which once represented commercial breaks.

Details of all 116 titles can be found on COMMENT #1 (see link below). Included are 1 to 10 viewer poll ratings, country of origin (if other than USA), years of release and best-known actors for each film.",1214179200,37,1428,6.6310160427807485

however, I must tell you that watching 100 movie it takes time.. time for some may be years !!
This time factor to watch 100 movie itself is BIG comedy.. I have just watched  two so far and
very satisfied with its quality and selection. If you are busy person do not go for it rather just choose what you want separately.
however, I am thankful that all beautiful things are available at very reasonable price and that's great!",1403481600,,525,4.357142857142857

8272479,5,B001989ZFI,"This is a great collection of old time comedies from silent slapstick through somewhat sophisticated 50's comedies.  You'll find practically everyone involved in comedy including Chaplin and Keaton.  Some 2nd feature greats such as gems from the East Side Kids and even Senator Claghorn who originated on Fred Allen's radio show.  Lots of these are rather zany, and downright corny, but they're fun.  Highly recommended.",1384473600,,420,5.415384615384616
8272480,4,B001989ZFI,"I purchased this set along with Mill Creek's 100 Greatest Comedy Classics (which contains both the COMEDY KINGS & HOLLYWOOD COMEDY LEGENDS 50 Packs). That was a mistake on my part, because 100 COMEDY CLASSICS also contains ALL 50 films that are offered in the COMEDY KINGS 50 pack. My fault, I should have checked! That's okay, someone will receive COMEDY KINGS as a gift from me!! I own several of the other Mill Creek box sets as well, I love old movies & these sets offer INCREDIBLE VALUE.

I live in Canada, & I placed my order just on the eve of Hurricane Sandy. Considering the awful circumstances, it arrived pretty quickly & undamaged.

100 COMEDY CLASSICS offers a great selection of films mainly from the mid 30's through the 50's. Plus a great selection of early rare silent films The Keystone Kops, Fatty Arbuckle, Chaplin, East Side Kids, & Laurel & Hardy. The inclusion of those rarities is why I picked this set up. Picture quality can vary from one film to the next, but most everything is watchable. This is a 2009 release & the image quality on some of the classic films like ""His Girl Friday"" is very disappointing. However, Mill Creek remastered it & some other ""must have movies""  from a much better source for 2011's HOLLYWOOD COMEDY LEGEND 50 pack. So, despite some duplication, I'd recommend getting that set also.

Things are getting better....Regarding Mill Creek entertainment's picture quality, I recently picked up Micki & Maude, Hanky Panky, There's A Girl In My Soup, & Modern Romance - a 2 disc set that's part of their new 4 movie collection, Hollywood Hits series. I'd venture a guess that they are taken from the original Columbia Pictures masters. The image quality is outstanding and they are presented in widescreen!!",1358899200,5,1755,4.7631578947368425
8272481,4,B001989ZFI,"A wide variety of old films.  I wouldn't call most of them ""classics"", but they are all funny, and you will probably come across a lot of interesting old films that you would not have come across elsewhere.  Picture quality is pretty good, but the tops & bottoms are cut off on a lot of the older films.  Given the sheer number of films you get, it is a great value for the money.",1355184000,2,380,4.108108108108108
8272482,3,B001989ZFI,"For the most part, the movies in this set were B movies, i.e., movies a theater owner had to rent if he wanted to show a movie from the A list.
The plot lines are improbable, the acting is amateurish, the production values are simple or virtually non-existant.  Of course, some of the stars of the era are here, but not in their prime or in their best movie.

Still, the titles are sometimes interesting despite the flaws.  Virtually all actors and many an actress were smokers and used lighting up as a bit of stage business.  Look up their bios in IMDb and you'll discover that more than a few died of cancer.  I especially liked the shots of the old cars, not taken from storage warehouses of props but the real things.  And of course there is something amusing and sometimes deplorable in what was the conventional wisdom of the times.  For example, black Americans said ""I is"" etc., were stupid and were afraid of ghosts, cemeteries, and corpses.  They were generally figures of fun, of such falseness as to make a rational person cringe today.

If you like good movies, however, you won't find many here.",1319760000,5,1110,4.5376884422110555
