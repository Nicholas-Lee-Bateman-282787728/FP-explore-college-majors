It's something I was able to do right in my own home, at my convenience, and it has really motivated me to go to the next steps and do more for my goal of getting more fit....a perfect introduction, or a way to get back to doing things that are good for one's body.  I felt more energetic , more flexible, and proud of myself for taking this first step!  Sandi, in Denver",1387411200,2,517,4.14
