8162322,5,B000LMPDJA,"It was an awesome experience to be part of the first of three trips Mexico with Muslims, Christians and Jews to build a house in one day for families in Mexico. The relationships built on these trips continue to this day. I wouldn't exchange the joy I found in these relationships for anything in the world. The film is an accurate depiction of the hopes of the leaders from each of these faith communities. Would that there would be more efforts like this around the country and the world.",1222560000,3,490,4.51685393258427
8162323,5,B000LMPDJA,"I saw this film on TV and loved it.  It was inspiring and really well made and captures the essense of how peace in the world should be.  While other films focus on the negative that is going on in the world, this film captures the positive and is a breath of fresh air.

I highly recommend it. The DVD has extra features which are interesting.  It makes a great holiday present too.",1177027200,2,383,4.205479452054795
