8729998,2,B0147LR1CW,"I Recently got this title for less than half the retail value from one of amazon's sales and upon receiving the product i'm glad i waited. This release seems to be made just for the money. The cover is generic and of low quality on good quality paper, the blu-ray does have disc art but again rushed. I Will be buying volume 2 & 3 because i love the show but my advice is wait till you can get them cheap. There just not worth the $15 price tag that they originally had. I Included a picture of the back so people can read the episodes.",1454284800,3,536,4.066037735849057
