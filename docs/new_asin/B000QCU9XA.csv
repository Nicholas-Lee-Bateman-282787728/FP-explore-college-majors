8195672,5,B000QCU9XA,"I grew up watching the old 'singing cowboy' movies.  If you are looking for a bit of nostalgia this will fit the bill.  There is also the ""comfort"" factor.  They bring back memories of going to the local movie theatre on a Saturday afternoon.  You would usually go with friends and then walk home afterwards and talk about what a great movie it was...even if it wasn't.  Back then I would have a coke with my popcorn...today, at home, I can have something a little stronger with the popcorn.  Good movies.",1403481600,,505,4.4945054945054945

8195674,5,B000QCU9XA,"Being a city girl, I didn't know what to expect out of these cowboy movies.  But I found them to be very likeable.  I checked this collection out of my local public library.  The first movie in the set features Rex Allen and has actually a fairly complex plot.  And the movie featuring Gene Autry, while simplistic, nonetheless is likeable too.  The overall goodness of the lead characters gives these movies a refreshing charm that is lost nowadays.  And by the way, the voices of these cowboys are remarkable.  Very impressive.  They sing with the full voice but with soft expression.  These movies are appropriate for family viewing.  And they are just plain fun.",1330560000,,666,4.7631578947368425

8195676,5,B000QCU9XA,"If you like the old western movies before technicolor, this DVD is for you.  Ah, life seemed so simple--the good guys win and the bad guys lose, and the good guys sing along the way.  There's even a bit of comic relief.  This DVD is good if you need to get a different (better) perspective on life, too.  Life doesn't have to be as complicated anad full of stuff as we make it.",1296086400,,377,4.123287671232877
