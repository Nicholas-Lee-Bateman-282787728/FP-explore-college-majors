416536,5,6302037336,I have been looking for this movie for years.  I was so glad when it was finally released on DVD.  This is a powerful story with a strong cast.

416537,5,6302037336,"Miguel Pinero is the most underated playwright of modern American theater. His play short eyes shows us the ugly underbelly of American society through the eyes of convicts. It is a play filled with ethnic anomosity racial rivalaries and a rigid moral code which allows no devation.  Truly this film version of the stage play is worth looking at. Bruce Davidson performace is complelling and the rest of the cast never miss a beat. It is not for the faint hearted.
Most unfortunate is that Mr. Pinero is no longer with us but some might remember the Miami Vice episodes he penned",1018224000,14,579,4.676470588235294

416590,4,6302037336,"Overshadowed by the earlier era of Cagney/Raft prison films, and sidelined by the rise of Gangsta culture, this movie remains one of the most authentic prison ""experiences.""  Though I won't give it five stars - its honest brutality makes it impossible for me to ""love"" - it's an accurate reflection of 70s-era ghetto culture and its inverted violence in the NYC prison system.  Author/playwright Miguel Pinero was himself part of this culture and brought to his story a social sensitivity lacking in modern Gangsta or law-and-order flicks.

In the world of the American prison system race and class hierarchies are reversed.  The white middle class offender played by Bruce Davison finds himself the despised minority.  His status as ""creep"" and ""short eyes"" seems but an excuse for vindictive racism and social payback, with other inmates expiating their own crimes by sacrificing him to a morality none of them really believe, as they sexually prey upon one another or gloat over transvestite prostitutes.

Not for the faint-hearted, this period piece still captures the fundamental inhumanity of prison and the complicity of the ""good and decent"" in keeping it that way as long as it's inflicted out of sight upon the lower orders.  Davison's bonus interview is worth watching as essential background.",1456272000,,1304,5.180952380952381

416615,5,6302037336,"SHORT EYES (1977) was originally a stage drama written by Miguel Piero.
It played to 80 audiences on Broadway and won the 1975 Best Play Tony.
Piero appears here as ""Go-Go,"" a character written just for the movie.

This grim film has one light moment when inmates Freddy Fender and Curtis Mayfield each do songs that
sound ad-lib, as fellow prisoners clap, tap and offer signifying choruses. Then it all gets deadly serious.

Soon after Bruce Davison arrives, the head guard lets everyone know he was convicted for child molesting. During a private talk, a fellow inmate (Jos Prez) asks if it's all true and at first Davison does an ""I'm not sure"" denial, but then he confesses to other sexual acts with young girls, and the details are stomach-turning. Yes he was a predator, and now Bruce is in for all sorts of tortures at the hands of his peers.

This is an intense story that has lost none of its power during the passage of decades. Brilliant performances abound.
NOTE: bilingual ability is a real plus for viewers.

416621,2,6302037336,"I feel a little weird about reviewing Short Eyes because I didn't actually  finish the movie.  I happened across the play when I was downloading books for my Kindle, and it's in my queue but I haven't gotten around to reading it yet...so when I noticed the film was available on Amazon Prime, I thought I'd check it out.  Having worked with sex offenders in the criminal justice system for many years, I was especially interested to see this film, since it deals with that subject.  But, somehow I just never really felt any identification with the characters or saw any clear plot developing.  I made it through about 35 minutes, and still is just felt like a bunch of scenes of daily life in a prison.  Yes, it was loud, dark, and claustrophobic, which felt very true.  But by the mid-point in a movie, I like to have characters that I care about and the feeling that a story is developing, which I just never felt.  It's possible that it just felt too dated for my taste, because there may have been more character development and story line than I noticed because of all the background noise and echo from being in such a claustrophobic environment.  But, in the end I decided to just read the play instead of finishing the film.  Maybe others had a different experience than I did, though.",1402444800,,1294,4.515021459227468
416622,3,6302037336,"Brief Plot Description:

A child molester is sent to prison to find out that he is detested by the other inmates.

My Experience With The Film:

I have to say that this is a rather odd film, not because it's virtually unknown (although I do find that a bit odd) but that it is a low budget masterpiece. Just as odd to me is the gripping storyline that captivated me from start to finish. Short Eyes (1977) has quite a reputation, I found out, amongst hard core fanatics for Exploitation films of the 1970's. Short Eyes's characteristics portray fear and anguish unlike any other prison film I have seen. Equally as odd, is despite its horrifying storyline and abysmal undercurrent of violence, this film has little to no onscreen violence such as excessive gore or any blood to mention at all.

Short Eyes's excellent portrayal of prison life is unequaled to my recollection..(not mentioning OZ whose groundbreaking cinematic and rough depiction of brutal prison life and as to date, remains unmatched.) Where as OZ was filmed on a staged set and is a long series..Short Eyes was filmed on location of a real Jail in Manhattan, New York, called ""The Tombs"" and apparently was so infamous that in 1977 Short Eyes was a sight to behold and a sight one would rather not see in person.

It's cheap low-budget cinematography is base and very bland, somehow though for this film, this style of inexpensive filmmaking works wonders for the picture and is a historic piece showing the good old days of jail/prison architect. One of the guards in the movie keeps sticking his arm inside a metal closet like box..that just looks disastrous to put your hand in as well as manual key turning.

Confined to only a series of small barred rooms and double bunked ceils, some may feel the claustrophobic and confining lifestyle of real prison life. Another odd concept is that the film, although obviously pertaining to prison life is the scenarios; a hierarchy between races with a deep longevity is portrayed throughout and these types of scenarios would take years to establish. Short Eyes loses none of it graphic and realistic feel; even though in the story-line; the inmates are waiting to bail out or are awaiting sentencing for brutal crimes that would lead them ultimately to Sing Sing prison. That being said Short eyes is a testament to the horrors and anguish of both prison life and a short incarceration in jail which btw is equally as dismal.

In one of the most shocking and disturbing scenes I have ever witnessed, we hear a very graphic and uncomfortable confession from one of the inmates, whose long pedophiliac history has taken him for a long slow ride to absolute hell. This 15 minute scene is one of the most gut wrenching and mentally anguishing scenes I have ever seen on-film; I could barely continue to listen and must say I have never heard or dared to learn about this secret life of the master child molester before. That scene alone had me cringing and may stand out among other prison films as being the most vividly graphic and honestly horrifying depiction of what goes on inside the mind of a child rapist that quite possibly has EVER been explored on film.

Although the films description relies heavily upon this concept and character named Clark Davis played by Bruce Davidson; a fairly well known actor who has starred in many television shows of the 80's and 90's but the importance of other inmates, particularly Juan, who ends up being what he calls a ""father confessor"" to the sick mind of Clark Davis, to me it is apparent that Juan may have suffered from sexual child abuse, probably from his own father as in another harrowing but brief scene he mentions to Clark that his father used to say he would ""screw em from 8 to 80, blind crippled or crazy"" and any victim of child abuse would recognize this statement along with Juan's unusual curiosity to learn what goes on inside the mind of a pedophile; as being connected to personal abuse. Juan wants to understand why and how a person like Clark, could continue to live a lifestyle like this hurting innocent children and not seek help. Some scenes like this may seem far-fetched as no one, I'd suspect who lives or has lived this life, would ever confess this to anyone.

However the bulk of the story line ends up being how the other inmates deal with discovering this news. None of it good for Clark as the inmates viciously brutalize him with humiliation, overt violence, and cruel treatment; just as Clark had done to so many innocent children. Some of these scenes stand out as being an emotional ride that connects us with the inward feelings of the ""normal"" human being. Also even more interesting and enjoyable was the cameo appearances of Curtis Mayfield who not only wrote the musical score for the film but also starred in it. Anything featuring the music of Curtis Mayfield should ever be considered a bad thing.

Also starring in this excellent film is the writer of the short play also called Short Eyes in which this film is based on Miguel Pinero. Some other scenes worth mentioning while not giving anything away is how the inmates directly deal with the long dangerous and dragginly slow days inside of prison with inmates singing where there is a scene with Freddy Fender sings ""Break It Down"" and in another scene we see the inmates playing a mock horse race but with cockroaches. Short Eyes is mesmerizing and surprisingly horrific without today's overt bloody graphics. Short Eyes is nothing less than a journey of spot on filmmaking that captures the exact essence of the depression, fear, and hopelessness that is the world of the incarcerated. A must see for anyone especially for prison movie junkies/ Short Eyes is a prison/jail movie that I can assure its viewers will not likely soon forget.

416623,5,6302037336,"Although outdated, the late Nuyorican playwright, ex-con, hustler & poet Miguel Piero's hardcore story about a child molestor (Davison) getting his dues in a NYC jail (filmed on location in The Tombs) packed quite a punch when it was released in the late 70s. Why?  After all, this is the decade that gave us the very best in cheap exploitation grindhouse cinema (i.e., I Spit on Your Grave; Last House on the Left; Cannibal Holocaust). The answer is most likely the raw realism of and sensitive theme of pedophilia which, to this day, is rarely touched upon in American film. Piero, an ex-convict from the Lower East Side who served time in The Tombs, pulls no punches and tells a grimy urban tale that you won't see in Hollywood. However I do predict a remake in the future and something tells me it will suck just like 98% of them.",1329696000,3,834,4.56
416624,5,6302037336,This is how HBO came up with the idea for the HBO series OZ! This movie is classic. Not as raw as Oz but exactly the same concept. This movie is highly recommended...,1318550400,,166,4.0606060606060606
416655,5,6302037336,"""Short Eyes"" is the 1977 film adaptation of Miguel Pinero's 1974 play of the same name. Pinero himself appears as one of the characters here, more or less playing himself as the Puerto Rican convict and street-hustler that he actually was, and which was his inspiration for this play and movie. Contrary to misstatements I've seen all over the Web, the term ""short eyes"" refers to any and all pedophiles, not just those attracted to boys; the prisoner who is labeled a ""short eyes"" in this film is held on charges of molesting girls.

The film is set on a cell-block at New York's Riker's Island prison in the 1970s. The prisoners are divided along ethnic lines of blacks, Puerto Ricans and whites, with additional ideological cleavages along pseudo-religious racial lines. There are three strands of tension here: ethnic/racial; moral, with the ""short eyes"" prisoner being the target of everyone's moral outrage; and sexual, which grounds the whole story. Sexual deprivation is driving various schemes to seduce and reduce to sexual slavery one young, inexperienced prisoner named Juan who the others call Cupcake. The arrival of a sexual predator of children, however, presents a more ""legitimate"" target for all those looking to ""cop"" -- get sex off of a willing or unwilling inmate. Pinero's dialogue, the performances of actors who expertly duplicate 1970s New York City street culture, and the element of authenticity to the sexual tension and plots in the story-line (I have a brother who was a prison guard and a cousin and acquaintances who were inmates on Rikers before the reforms of the 1990s) is what makes this one of the great indie films of its era.",1317427200,4,1665,4.946428571428571

This movie and some of the scenes in it would be a good ""wake up call"" for anyone thinking about having sex with an underage person.  The movie with some of the music and the hair styles in it has the feel of the typical late '70's like the music from ""Rocky"" or ""Saturday Night Fever"" and the disco era hairstyles..

416659,4,6302037336,"""Short Eyes"" is not the average prison film.
So if you watch the movie with preconceived ideas
about Hollywood prison life, most likely you
won't like the movie. While all the ingredients of
an accurate inmate experience are included,
it's done so in an intelligent, suggested manner.
There is no sex, no nudity, and minimal violence (though
nonetheless graphic is the violence that does appear).
The lack of these elements would normally turn most
people off who are interested in standard prison flicks.
However, the shortage of visual shock elements works
to the film's advantage. Why? Basically, the viewer
is ""forced"" to concentrate on the most important feature
of the film:  the excellent script/dialogue.

""Short Eyes"" invites the viewer into inmate life and examines
the struggles, hypocrisies, and triumphs that exist.  This
film is all about the characters and how they survive in a
world that has marginalized them to the point of nonexistance.
In response, the inmates have created their own world.  Adequate time
is given to character development, which is a feature of any great film.
The verbal interactions are entertaining and emotionally effective.
The script is a surprisingly direct, straight-from-the-streets dialogue
that you rarely find outside a real life documentary.

""Short Eyes"" comes off as a stylized stage production, as it
originally was. No frills; just straight, entertaining drama.
It's a worthwhile film for drama fans.

Also, Curtis Mayfield (who plays a bit part in the film) scored
an uncelebrated, but remarkable soundtrack for the movie. Actually,
""Short Eyes,"" in general, has been underrated and uncelebrated.
However, that doesn't disqualify it's brilliance.",1179100800,3,1703,5.407547169811321
416660,4,6302037336,"""Short Eyes,"" based on the play by Miguel Pinero, is probably the first prison drama to tell what life in prison is really like. For example, violence is not dramatic in the movie- it's casual and unexpected. In one scene, a prisoner is mopping the floor, and someone puts his arm into the gate just as it's closing, breaking his arm. Several other prisoners take cheap shots at him as they walk by. In addition, there's definitely a sense that there's danger and tension just below the surface every day; not even the well-respected prisoners are ever completely safe.

The plot concerns Clark Davis, an alleged child rapist, who is immediately ostracized by the guard and his fellow inmates. In one harrowing scene, the inmates, led by ""Longshoe"" Murphy, inflict ""psychological violence"" on Davis, as the director puts it in the commentary. Murphy is the only white inmate who the black and Puerto Rican inmates respect, and he despises Davis both because of his crime and because he feels that he reflects badly on the other white inmates. The only prisoner who shows any empathy to Davis is Juan, a well-respected Puerto Rican. At one point, Clark confesses to Juan that he has struggled with pedophilia all his life and that he ""just can't stop himself."" It's hinted that Davis did not receive due process in the line-up, and that it's only a matter of time before he's released, but it is made clear that he has molested girls before. With this knowledge, Juan is torn between trying to help Davis and the responsibility he feels towards keeping him from molesting again. A council of representatives from the ethnic groups in prison feel that he must die, and not even Juan may be able to save him.

""Short Eyes"" is a compelling movie. The profanity and brutality, though mild today for jaded viewers, was pushing the envelope in its time. It does have some flaws, however. In the commentary, the director mentioned that the play was rather rambling, and that they had to compress the scenes together for a movie to work. They generally succeeded, but much of the movie, particularly the beginning, has a staged feel. In the first 30 minutes before Davis shows up, different characters are explored; this would work in a play, but not so much on film. There's also a scene, not in the play, where the prisoners jam out; they're led by Curtis Mayfield, who wrote the soundtrack. This really adds nothing to the movie, and in fact slows it down. The quality of the footage is not great either. But overall, this is a powerful film, and must-see for fans of prison dramas and 70s cinema.",1177286400,,2591,4.717439293598234

This movie paved it's way toward more harsher prison films later on this one marks Lois Guzman's screen debut and at first I missed him. Yepper he's that quick in the scene. Although Short Eyes isn't awardwinning by any standards It still gets under my skin only because of the news and widespread topics centering on Pedophiles.

416663,4,6302037336,"""Short Eyes"" was released in 1977 and stars a multi-ethnic cast playing inmates in a Sing-Sing style prison.  The prisoners belong to tight groups, divided primarily along racial lines, and co-exist with relatively little violence.  They even have a ""council,"" comprised of the leaders of the various groups, that establishes acceptable actions for the prisoners.  Into this composition comes Bruce Davison, an alleged child molester, who the prisoners dub ""freak"" and ""short eyes.""  The story is told rather loosely and episodically, as it moves toward its inevitable but gritty conclusion.

In 1977, ""Short Eyes"" must have seemed shatteringly realistic and harrowing.  Today, the film feels a bit stagy; not surprisingly, the screenplay was based on a play - by noted Puerto Rican playwright, Miguel Pinero (he also has a small part as Go Go).  Despite this flaw, the characterizations are solid and the acting is often quite good; Freddy Fender and Curtis Mayfield even show up to sing some songs!  In addition, the film explores prison race relations in a startlingly frank and credible manner.  Overall, the film is one of the better prison dramas and likely to appeal to fans of 70s cinema.

The DVD extras include an interesting commentary track with the film's director Robert Young as well as director Leon Ichaso, who made ""Pinero"" based on the life of the playwright.  Unfortunately, the film is not subtitled, which would be helpful with the considerable jargon and the rapid-fire delivery of the inmates.",1103328000,14,1517,5.151020408163265
416664,5,6302037336,"I had considered writing an extensive review for the film ""Short Eyes,"" but after seeing that fabulous reviews by some amazon.com users I felt at loss of what to say because it had already been said. After reading those comments made by the reviewers, I feel that I will not want to go through any of the main themes or storyline but babble about what I like in this film adaptation of the play by the late great Pinero.

Indeed, Short Eyes features a superb cast of unknowns and slightly known actors who appeared in film productions of the 70's. I have also heard that the film (like the play) cast several real inmates for the supporting roles and extras. In the introduction of the play ""Short Eyes"" the writer mentions that the casting of inmates enabled them for a chance to ""make the sidewalk."" Supposedly, this was also the case for the film.

Jose Perez, previously known for his miscellaneous TV work, is definitely the protagonist of this film. Here he plays Juan, a tough yet compassionate prisoner-janitor who has the courage to question the motives of Clark Davis, the ""short eyes freak"" played by Bruce Davison. Throughout the film we witness Juan and Clark interacting as a compassionate therapist would act with an emotionally disturbed client. In one scene, Clark reveals to Juan his pedophilic history, which involved a young ""rican"" girl. Juan is deeply disturbed by this revelation but still tries to understand him instead of killing him ""stone-dead"" at the instance. Jose Perez would go on to play another compassionate, saintly janitor in the Broadway play Steam Bath.

On that note (did I say note) two musicians were cast for this film: Curtis Mayfield and Freddy Fender. There is also an out of print soundtrack album to this film with songs by both actors/musicians; but pretty much Mayfield had the upper-hand, writing the intro theme song, and other incidental music. If you see this album in your used record store BUY IT!

These two previously mentioned actors were written into the film script but were not in the original play. Miguel Pinero, the author of Short Eyes, appeared in the film as well. Pinero played Gogo, a sly yet unruly prisoner whose part was also written for the film. Although I must say that Pinero has immense talent as a playwright, & as a poet his prose has stood as scriptures for Latino subculture; his acting is barely sufficient and maybe I am saying that because I don't see enough of it to form a substantial belief.

It is too bad that Pinero was left on the sidelines (either writing film scenerios, addicted to some form of narcotics, or most likely involved in a serious criminal act) and was not able to present more creative ideas and projects to the public. His most famous play (the one in question) took an extreme amount of time to see the light of day. Be it working with Tito Goya in Sing Sing (who appeared in the film as Cupcakes and was later executed on a serious murder charge) on the walk throughs, or negotiating with the prison for a drama workshop with Marvin Felix Camillo; Miguel, with the assistants of Joseph Pap, could never have pulled it off alone.

For those who liked Short Eyes and are interested in Miguel Pinero, check out (if you haven't that is ) LA Bodega Sold Dreams a collection of his prose-poems, The Sun Always Shines for the Cool, Outrageous One Act Plays, two collections of sundry plays, raw & fun respectively. For film buffs try to find Miami Vice: The Movie which contains Pinero in a bit part, as well as Breathless (1983), Deal of the Century, and Fort Apache the Bronx which includes Pinero plus Tito Goya.",1093219200,10,3619,4.673469387755102

7819978,4,6302037336,"The movie is kind of cool! It's my first time seeing this picture! Wonder if they might do a remake to this movie! It was also based on a play to back in the days. This teaches everybody that prison is not the place to be when they find out what is your reasons for being here! You got to do 2 things! You got to survive or die trying to survive! And the number one rule is do your time, don't let the time do you; if you know what I mean!

And better yet, soundtrack by Curtis Mayfield  with Curtis having a role as a prisoner and singing one of the best songs from the soundtrack! The pedophile theme was really creepy and the actor playing the pedophile did a great job of being creepy. I heard about this movie years ago and am glad I finally got to see it here thanks to Amazon!",1465948800,,503,4.294736842105263
