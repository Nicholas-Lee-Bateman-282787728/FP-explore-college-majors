5931350,5,B00EOMJ9SY,I purchased the 4th Season of Republic of Doyle as a Christmas gift for a relative.  Every year I send her the latest complete season!  She waits for the gift and watches the shows with her family. Great Christmas gift for anyone living away from Newfoundland and I thought it was a very good price!,1384041600,,299,4.418181818181818

5931363,5,B00EOMJ9SY,"Jake Doyle, his friends and family and the object of his affections - the elusive Sgt. Leslie Bennett - are back for a fourth season in St. John, Newfoundland where there's more crime than you might first imagine.
Jake and his father, who run the Doyle & Doyle private detective agency, don't always handle cases in the most orthodox of manners but they always manage to solve the crime and in this season there are some fairly bizarre crimes to solve. Bikers, drug dealers and the usual run of ne'er-do-wells keep them busy as always.
What sets this season apart from its previous incarnations, however, is the fact that the secondary characters in this Canadian crime series have greatly expanded roles. Jake's niece Tinny (well, her real name is Katrina but no one calls her that) began in Season One as a troubled teen. In Season Four she joins the police force, for example, and even though still a cadet gets involved in some major cases.
There are also some interesting twists in this season. Jake has been ardently pursuing the beautiful Sgt. Bennett and at the end of Season Three it looked as though that pursuit was going to end in failure. In Season Four, however, Jake and Leslie make some discoveries about themselves and she seems - finally - to be ready to see him as something more than an annoyance.
'Republic of Doyle' has developed a reputation as a tightly written crime series that is laced with humor and just the right amount of romance. In Season Four that reputation is not only maintained but enhanced.",1416355200,,1529,4.687732342007435

All the same people are back:  Mal, Rose, Des, Leslie, and Tinny.  Some surprises are in store for you concerning Tinny and Jake and Leslie.  Buy the series to find out.

5931373,5,B00EOMJ9SY,I never buy DVD's but was having a hard time finding this online. So I bought it!  Can't wait until Season 5 is released as well! Nice not having to wait until Sat nights (here in LA) for an old re-run. Now I'm catching up to this great series!,1404172800,,244,3.979591836734694

Funny, and good story lines.  The acting is very good also.",1401494400,,111,4.285714285714286
5931375,5,B00EOMJ9SY,"This show is so much fun and I love sharing it with friends. It's set in my home town of St. John's, Newfoundland in Canada and they love showing off the colourful downtown area. Father & Son detective agency means lots of action too. Give it a try.",1400976000,,249,4.208333333333333
5931376,5,B00EOMJ9SY,"Found this series from a Canadian friend when it was into its 2nd season.  Love the quirkiness and warmth of its characters; the charm of St. John's, Newfoundland; and for a detective series - LESS GORE AND VIOLENCE than found on our American TV.  As I'm also a huge fan of Great Big Sea, I especially like the episodes where their front man, Alan Doyle plays his part of undercover criminal.  The series has it all - a strong family base with some light-hearted family bickering; outside love interests; and crimes to be solved.  Jake Doyle is funny; always getting himself into jams.  Scott Grimes also appeared in earlier seasons - he was HILARIOUS and I wish they would include him more frequently.  We've purchased all four seasons available, and look forward to buying Season 5 when released.  CHARMING AND ADDICTIVE series - sit back, smell the salt air of Newfoundland, hoist a pint and enjoy!!!!",1394064000,,904,4.756410256410256
5931377,5,B00EOMJ9SY,"Having been to St. John's and NFD I  appreciate the authenticity of the site, surroundings, accents And demeanor of the people and characters. It's simple and charming like the natives.",1391731200,,185,5.166666666666667
5931378,5,B00EOMJ9SY,"Plot is getting a bit adolescent. Hoping for future seasons to be a bit more complex. I either had the story figured out in the first 5 minutes, or the twist was random.  Still lots of laughs, and they are finally getting comfortable with the accents.",1389657600,,251,4.456521739130435
5931379,5,B00EOMJ9SY,"REPUBLIC OF DOYLE is one one of the coolest and best shows around. It's a combo of THE ROCKFORD FILES and NORTHERN EXPOSURE. The best thing about it is that this show is a real labor of love by creator, writer,producer and star Allan Hawco and it shows in every plot, every frame and every character. A real rarity in today's market. It's good to see it's so successful.",1387065600,4,370,4.3768115942028984
5931380,5,B00EOMJ9SY,"Clever, witty, charming and with minimal violence.  Characters you care about, good storylines, fabulous scenery and few guns.  There is a profound difference between Canadian shows (as this is) and American ones.  Guns in RoD are rarely used and the police don't go rampaging into situations guns blazing as they would in the USA shows.  This is TV at its best - it has everything.

I am hanging out for Season 5 and hoping for thousands more!",1384819200,,444,4.714285714285714
