A true story about a ship, the Rainbow Warrior, a Greenpeace ship that is protesting against nuclear testing in the Southern Pacific. When they dock in Auckland, New Zealand, a bomb is planted and the rips open the vessel, killing a crew member.

The Skipper has to convince the police superintendent that this is an act of terrorism.  True life proves to be good drama. The events that followed keep you in suspense and later disbelief.

It's a good story and make a good movie, but can leave you a bit cynical about international relations.",1226880000,,690,5.87
