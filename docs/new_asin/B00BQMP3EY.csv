Grapevine Video's version is very nice - beautiful, clear picture quality and a fitting military-themed soundtrack that compliments the film well. Highly recommended!",1503792000,,290,5.466666666666667
8572723,5,B00BQMP3EY,"Such a fine story with great actors!.  I'm new to watching silent films and they take a little getting used to for someone born into ""talkies"", but I enjoy them.  Title cards give us the general story,  music sets the mood, actors provide movement and expression, and I can within those parameters, write the dialogue!  The story in Dress Parade is patriotic and well done with some history of West Point included.  As usual, William Boyd lives up to all my expectations as a superb actor portraying a star athlete whose success has gone to his head. He visits West Point and eyes the daughter of a colonel (played by Bessie Love, also a fine actor).  He falls for her and decides to enter West Point.  For such a young man with a big ego, what follows are the stern realities that he encounters when he becomes a cadet, and what he must go through to meet these challenges, overcome them,  and graduate.",1428710400,2,904,4.5030674846625764
