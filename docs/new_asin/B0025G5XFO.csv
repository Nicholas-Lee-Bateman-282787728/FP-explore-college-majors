Doesn't matter, I was on the edge of my seat. It is very suspenseful at times.",1527984000,,174,3.861111111111111
8351045,2,B0025G5XFO,"What an utter bore this film is. Why would anyone green light  a movie about a talented young writer who is undone in the prime of her life by the mind games of an older, snobbier bore of the British upper class?  Nothing happens in this movie except Maggie Smith, who toils valiantly with every facet of her talent to make this sodden mess interesting. Stephen Poliakoff never gives the viewer the payoff that might explain how a gifted writer could allow this dull and uninteresting man to take away her confidence in her talent. It's not a thriller, or even a creepy mind-games sort of thriller? The rest of the cast is nowhere in Smith's league.

If you want to see Maggie Smith in top form try another HBO TV film called MY HOUSE IN UMBRIA. Pass CAPTURING MARY by.",1359417600,,769,4.439716312056738

This  movie is a complex masterpiece.
It takes a brave walk into the dark to realize what the story is about: archetypical figures of struggle. It's all there, especially after the main characters move downstairs into the mansion's wine cellar: downstairs = underworld/subconscious; dark corridors= unknown paths inside the psyche; wine = dimed perception/contents that live in the blur of lose consciousness/ information that frightens even though not making apparent sense/ mental confusion/ chaos set on by dark secrets. Therefore, the personal hell is triggered from the place where figures of the Shadow/ Subconscious emerge, and then ""capture"" the feminine character. (And some review says it's a ""bad title""?) She's keep under its spell/power for too long time, while she is alone with the remains of the darkness and its effects on her career and creativity, that also having an impact in the way she conduces her love/intimate life parallel to her social life in a post-war rapidly changing scenario.
So, there is something sinister and claustrophobic about this story. Something that seemed so right and strong and ready to take flight is interrupted for Mary. After that, it takes her all her life - and finally a sweet, positive masculine figure - to encourage her to review her past, go back to the point where it all started, and try to cast away the ghost.
I bet many women can relate to Mary, in the sense of having experienced imprisonment after the dangerous contact with a predatory figure or circumstance that embodies the power and control of a patriarchal society taking over her inner world.
THAT SAID, THIS MOVIE IS A MUST SEE. Teachers, psychologists and mothers should discuss it at schools, seminars or at home. But if you are inclined to commercial fads such as vampire stories, it's not for you. This is not mere entertainment; this speaks to someone's life enigma solving quests'.
To boot, Maggie Smith, David Williams and Ruth Wilson draw hands down performances that guarantee their places in the Olympus of acting legends.",1318550400,8,2226,5.048913043478261

8351048,2,B0025G5XFO,"Joe , a young  guy, is the bored caretaker of  a beautiful house in London. Day after day , alone in the empty house he passes his days. Until one day, and dissobeing orders, he lets in an old lady: Mary Gilbert. Maybe because he is bored or just because he likes the unexpected company  Joe begins to talk to the lady who, in a reticent way starts telling him  a story that happened in that same house many years ago.
Mary Gilbert a newcomer to London has known a small literary success in a Britan that after the war  is following , slowly but surely the steps to  more modern ways. In one party  held at that very same house she  meets debonair and glamorous Greville White. The man who knows everyone who should be known.
With a certain gothic flavour she tells Joe how in meeting Greville her life and her once so promising future, went into anonimity  after refusing Greville's strange offer.
And so it is....not much happens, not much is told. Poliakoff, who  I ussually like, up to a point, has developed nothing but a ruse, a mirage. There is not story, there is nothing. Only  a beautiful  scenery with consistent performances that led us to nothing.
Simbolism and poetic figures are nice but if there is nothing behind what you got at the end it is a souffle that  only wraps air.
There is nothing wrong with the performances. Dame Maggie Smith is wonderful as usual, David Wallians a pleasant surprise and Ruth Wilson  plays a convincing Mary. But that is the only thing  we can say about.
Maybe Poliakoff wanted to show us the disgusting ways of the upper class in the 50's Britain or simply telling a twisted version of a could be Svengali but unfortunately he does not success. Because we do not know what is he talking about. Are the nightmares of a drunked woman? The confession of her own mediocrity? Or just a tale she tells? We never know , and I guess mr Poliakoff does not  neither.",1286928000,3,1904,4.42816091954023
