4491272,5,B004X1RUJQ,"Just like these type of documentaries, like to see all about history. will be renting some more type of these videos.",1353628800,,117,4.619047619047619
4491273,5,B004X1RUJQ,This is the type of character we need now to bring back the fabric of our great nation. Excellent documentary.,1352592000,,110,4.55
4491274,4,B004X1RUJQ,"This is a very interesting documentary on T. Roosevelt before he was president - focusing mainly on his time in the badlands of North Dakota where he really became the man he was to be.  Where he really developed his character.  This time period is the KEY to who he was and how he got to be that way.

It was wonderful to learn about this great man in our country's history - and there is also plenty of great scenery in this documentary.",1345766400,,439,4.2023809523809526
4491275,5,B004X1RUJQ,"This is an interesting piece about Teddy Roosevelt and North Dakota.  I did not know that his ranching experience in North Dakota really made him into a man!!!!  I can visualize this green horn from New York stepping off the train in Medora, Western North Dakota to look at his new ranch.  The real cowboys must of broke into laughter when he waltzed into the Medora bar.  I can see them making bets on how long this Eastern will make it in the real West.  His strong character was really given a chance to be tested and blossum.  Even if you don't have an interest in Teddy, you really should see this video and you will have a better understanding and respect for our future President.",1324166400,3,687,4.412698412698413
4491276,5,B004X1RUJQ,"There has NEVER been another president like Theodore Roosevelt, nor will there be ever again. Great documentary of great president and great man!",1476576000,,145,5.3478260869565215
4491277,4,B004X1RUJQ,An enjoyable review of the history behind a great President and a Freemason.,1474761600,,76,4.923076923076923
4491278,5,B004X1RUJQ,TR rode his way into our hearts via this excellent film...the film quality is poor in a way because of lack of sharpness but the content is 'deeeeee-lightful!'.Highly recommended!,1474070400,2,179,5.206896551724138
4491279,4,B004X1RUJQ,I liked it but it would have been more useful (and rated higher) if it had related a little more to other things in his life beyond North Dakota.  I am pretty sure the editor had his or her reasons for the scope presented.  (TR is not a straightforward subject.),1473120000,,262,4.22
4491280,5,B004X1RUJQ,It's a wonderful look at one of our finest Presidents. If you look history you will love this movie!,1470700800,,100,4.315789473684211
4491281,3,B004X1RUJQ,Interesting,1469232000,,11,11.0
4491282,5,B004X1RUJQ,Great story.,1468627200,,12,5.5
4491283,4,B004X1RUJQ,"It was a pretty good video, except that it appeared to be a commwrcial for the State of Dakota.",1468540800,,95,4.052631578947368
4491284,3,B004X1RUJQ,"I wouldn't want to spend much money on this but it does shed some light onto a very specific period in Roosevelt's life.  Any biography will mention his time in the ND badlands but most tend to rush through it and get to the ""more interesting"" parts.  However, according to Roosevelt himself this time was integral to who he became.

There are stretches of the video that do seem like something from the ND tourism department, but there are also some solid historical commentaries.  Hence 3 stars.  Not great, not awful.",1467504000,,520,4.670329670329671
4491285,5,B004X1RUJQ,It was extremely interesting. I couldn't put it down.,1463788800,,53,5.0
4491286,5,B004X1RUJQ,I enjoyed it greatly!  Saw photos that I hadn't seen before and learned some new things.  Great!,1463529600,,96,4.588235294117647
4491287,4,B004X1RUJQ,Good,1461715200,,4,4.0
4491288,5,B004X1RUJQ,Such a treat to hear the squeaky voice. I've read countless books about TR. This was like meeting and knowing him in the flesh. He always surprises. Nice opportunity for folks who know little about him to rub elbows.,1457222400,,216,4.564102564102564
4491289,4,B004X1RUJQ,I believe more reference to TR's experiences in Maine should have been included.,1455580800,,80,5.230769230769231
4491290,5,B004X1RUJQ,"Very interesting locally produced program that expands on what's commonly presented about TR's time on the range in North Dakota. I really enjoyed the additional details and local flavor. Is it a bit booster-ish about North Dakota? Yes, but not sickeningly so. I didn't see the obvious local pride of place as a defect. Clearly some other reviewers did.",1454976000,3,353,5.0
4491291,5,B004X1RUJQ,Really enjoyed viewing this documentary.  A lot of insight to Teddy's Montana years.  A good choice for anyone interested in him.,1454544000,,129,5.095238095238095
4491292,5,B004X1RUJQ,"Excellent film about a personal hero, TR.",1454025600,,41,5.0
4491293,5,B004X1RUJQ,A great inspirational story of how hard work and belief can affect ones life.,1447977600,,77,4.571428571428571
4491294,4,B004X1RUJQ,Loved it.,1446940800,,9,4.0
4491295,5,B004X1RUJQ,Loved it...this is why we cherish him as one of our best presidents...,1441843200,,70,4.461538461538462
4491296,3,B004X1RUJQ,It appeared they were working really hard to make a story. I am sure those from the area would enjoy it more.,1441584000,,109,4.0
4491297,5,B004X1RUJQ,Great documentary about a very important time inT.Rs life,1441238400,,57,5.444444444444445
4491298,5,B004X1RUJQ,Excellent piece.,1437177600,,16,7.5
4491299,3,B004X1RUJQ,Very enteresting guy. He was a self made man by his sheer will.,1435968000,,63,3.923076923076923
4491300,3,B004X1RUJQ,"It's a decent video, but whoever did the voices was the worst. I've literally never heard a ""scottish"" accent that sounded like a cross between stereotypical American Indian, South African, and a bad Russian.",1432339200,,208,5.147058823529412
4491301,4,B004X1RUJQ,I was surprised at how much Teddy wanted to be a cowboy. It really prepared him for the presidency as he learned about the common man.,1431648000,,134,4.1923076923076925
4491302,5,B004X1RUJQ,Beautiful documentary on one of America's heroes. Really helped me understand the man behind the myth. Very well done documentary!,1428364800,,130,5.55
4491303,3,B004X1RUJQ,"It was informative, the quality was OK, If you want to see more about TR's western experience then this is the documentary for you.",1427328000,,131,4.5
4491304,1,B004X1RUJQ,Insipid and stupid. Information is repeated over and over again. I felt like I was in a junior high history class on the day the teacher of out and a sub pulled this rag out of the rusty cabinet. Don't waste your time.,1420329600,,218,4.093023255813954
4491305,4,B004X1RUJQ,Very well done documentary of a very special period in a great man's life.,1418083200,,74,4.357142857142857
4491306,5,B004X1RUJQ,Great story a must see .so do it!,1417910400,,33,3.25
4491307,2,B004X1RUJQ,"Can someone, anyone,  tell me why a film on TR in his cowboy days is accompanied by music of Chopin and Mozart?? Does anyone  else find this odd??",1417219200,,146,4.178571428571429
4491308,2,B004X1RUJQ,"TR was a great man and interesting character,but this movie was boring. It's basically a PBS documentary about his life in North Dakota. Watch the first 25 minutes,and you will know all you need to know.",1415836800,,203,4.666666666666667
4491309,4,B004X1RUJQ,"A film that illuminates a major rationale behind Theodore Roosevelt's character growth.

Linking this piece to others would have been more helpful but, in and of itself, there is much to appreciate for students of Teddy.",1413849600,,220,5.111111111111111
4491310,4,B004X1RUJQ,What a guy.  You really see what made him into one of our greatest leaders.,1413504000,,75,4.0
4491311,4,B004X1RUJQ,Good narrative.,1413331200,,15,7.0
4491312,5,B004X1RUJQ,How he changed and directed our nation.  Can't help be inspired by his drive and tenacity.,1412640000,,90,4.625
4491313,4,B004X1RUJQ,"This is a good overview of his life in the West, and clearly points out some of the impact it had on his later life and Presidency.",1412294400,,131,3.888888888888889
4491314,4,B004X1RUJQ,Interesting backstory on how this man became known for his bravado and grit.,1412121600,,76,4.923076923076923
4491315,2,B004X1RUJQ,Very slanted to promote the state. Still interesting if unbalanced.,1411603200,,67,5.8
4491316,4,B004X1RUJQ,"A nice, brief synopsis of his life.  I never knew anything about him.",1410566400,,69,4.3076923076923075
4491317,5,B004X1RUJQ,I didn't know this part of Teddy Roosevelt's life. He bought a ranch in South Dakota and became a cowboy. It had quite the influence on him. Very interesting.,1409702400,,158,4.482758620689655
4491318,4,B004X1RUJQ,"I haven't finished watching this yet, but so far it has been an interesting portrayal of T.R.'s life.",1408838400,,101,4.666666666666667
4491319,5,B004X1RUJQ,Great,1408406400,,5,5.0
4491320,5,B004X1RUJQ,The story about that man was great and I learned a lot about the man i didn't know. I would recommed this video to anyone.,1397606400,,122,3.92
4491321,5,B004X1RUJQ,This period of his life illustrates why it was necessary for his political future. Still one the greatest presidents from the GOP.,1394496000,2,130,4.954545454545454
4491322,4,B004X1RUJQ,An interesting look at the young TR. Seemed to stress the stay in the Dakotas as essential for his rise to the presidency.,1392768000,,122,4.3478260869565215
4491323,2,B004X1RUJQ,Its just another documentary. Sounds better than it plays ..a chance it could have been better if it had more of TR and less of what his family thought of him .. I'm a bit disappointed.,1391558400,,185,4.166666666666667
4491324,1,B004X1RUJQ,"This cd is defective. I finally got around to watching it last week and it is defective. It has a 3/4"" purplish groove around the outside circumference and will not play. I have a NEW Blue Ray player. I was unable to re-call  the transaction so I didn't report it. Thanks for sending this. Please have someone contact me regarding returning and issuing credit.
Thanks

4491325,5,B004X1RUJQ,I used this for homeschool and the kids really enjoyed it. It kept their interest. It was very well done documentary .,1390435200,,118,4.409090909090909
4491326,5,B004X1RUJQ,"An excellent video and makes one want to read more about a true leader.
Great for all ages and should be viewed by all citizens ( especially  politicians) as a role model for leadership!",1389484800,,186,4.470588235294118
4491327,5,B004X1RUJQ,He's my favorite President and this documentary is a nice tribute to him. It's focus is explaining how President Theodore's character was brought into maturity through his bond to the lifestyle and friends he enjoyed in North Dakota.,1387756800,,233,5.157894736842105
4491328,5,B004X1RUJQ,excelent doc. i have ben waiting for more in between presadent and cannel! found a lot of info.i wanted to know. espesely real pictures. and health. (thanks),1386806400,,157,4.851851851851852
4491329,1,B004X1RUJQ,This looked more like a North Dakota tourist promotion than a history of this president.  Mostly fluff instead of real history lessons.,1386201600,2,135,5.136363636363637
4491330,1,B004X1RUJQ,"bought 2 of them neither worked. Got refunded for one and but no refund for the other. Had to take it on the nose for sure..  .

Albany, Oregon",1386028800,,183,4.2
4491331,4,B004X1RUJQ,Very good documentary on the overall personal growth of Teddy Roosevelt and the influence of his connection to the midwest.,1385942400,,123,5.2
4491332,4,B004X1RUJQ,"I appreciated this video, but mostly the photos and the vid-clips. I don't recall any ""new"" information that was revealed. However, it was engaging. And for those who haven't read much regarding this most unusual, powerful man, this would make an excellent introduction.",1381449600,,270,5.3023255813953485
4491333,5,B004X1RUJQ,"It's a pretty short doc and short of a lot of details.  However, it's one more piece of the puzzle in understanding one of the most successful and influential presidents of the 20th century.  His legacy includes lasting family values and happy lives for the nation's workers.  He's sculpted into Mount Rushmore with the founding fathers for a reason and it's great to learn why.  I should mention that I watched it free of charge with my prime membership.  If I had paid for it, the review would be more about how it's not worth the price.",1379203200,6,539,4.515463917525773
4491334,4,B004X1RUJQ,"Mostly about his time spent out on the ranch and how he behaved while out there - which practically led to TR forming the Rough Riders and eventually conceive the idea of running for Presidential office.

I thought this was worthwhile to watch, though I had been hoping to hear more detail on the time with the Rough Riders. However, I felt 4-stars was generous but not far-fetched.",1378339200,,382,4.617647058823529
4491335,1,B004X1RUJQ,"I gotta tell ya... this is just an ok piece of work, at best. Lots of photos... some background information... it's exactly like someone sitting and reading a book to us with photos and some background music, etc. Yawwwwnnnn! Just imagine... a piece about this great man and great President being boring... it would seem impossible, but these guys got it done! ZZZZZZZZ",1378339200,,369,4.873015873015873
4491336,4,B004X1RUJQ,"This was indeed a unique look at a formative period in the life of Theodore Roosevelt.  I knew that he had spent some time in the west, but had no idea that he built a cattle ranch business and took so seriously a driving desire to learn how to fit into a culture so different from the one in which he had been raised.  The documentary clearly displays the courage a a man who years later would carry arms into the Spanish-American war.  He proved he was not an eastern dandy, but a real man who fit into the frontier lifestyle, winning supporters after he went back east to continue his political career.",1377216000,,605,4.336283185840708
4491337,3,B004X1RUJQ,"i'm not sure what i expected with this video, but something more well rounded.  the piece is about the time roosevelt spent in the badlands and how it effected him as a man, how much he seemed to love it and how it was important for him to create these wonderful nature preserves and parks we have now - which is great, but this idea is repeated over and over.  if you were to edit this down so the idea was expressed only once, you'd have a piece that was only a few minutes long.  and the way that roosevelt's time is described in such detail, you would think that he spent years there, only to be told that it was only a scant few months.  it is telling to see who put the money up for this production.",1376956800,4,705,4.0503597122302155
4491338,3,B004X1RUJQ,"This documentary did provide some insight to TR but could have been so much more.  Very repetitive at times.
Was left still with much to learn about Teddy.",1371945600,,155,4.535714285714286
4491339,1,B004X1RUJQ,"Horrific. This was heavily subsidized by the Tourism Board of North Dakota (no joke) and the first 10-minutes of footage show the Dakota Badlands and talk about their majesty, without even mentioning T.R. The next several scenes show a modern actor, in period (cowboy) clothing, from the back, walking through fields with electronic noise and sepia-toned to make it look old. The lackluster, oddly-inflected, voice-enhances rather than dissipates the crushing dullness.

Not much information here about the larger than life persona of Teddy Roosevelt--which is a shame, because he's a great historic figure with a lot of story available for a good biographer.

This film doesn't give good service to T.R. and I suspect the Dakota Badlands suffer as well. I wish I could give it less than one-star.",1367366400,12,797,5.170542635658915
4491340,5,B004X1RUJQ,An accurate depiction of TR's tine in the Dakota territory.  It shows how TR's future as president was shaped by a brief period spent on the vanishing American frontier,1365724800,,168,4.793103448275862
4491341,4,B004X1RUJQ,I liked it because it was not a puff piece. It made a attempt to tell the whole story. Some political correctness did creep in.,1364601600,,127,4.12
4491342,3,B004X1RUJQ,This documentary wanders even though it covers a specific part of President Roosevelt's life. The commentaries by historian Douglas Brinkley saves this documentary from itself.,1363824000,,176,6.08
4491343,5,B004X1RUJQ,This documentary showed me some facts about a former president that I did not know.  What a great look back in time when real men faced challenges and adversity with grit and purpose.,1361836800,,183,4.545454545454546
4491344,3,B004X1RUJQ,Good story with good underlying premise.  It could have been shorter as it seemed to cover the same issues multiple times.,1360454400,,122,4.809523809523809
4491345,3,B004X1RUJQ,"There are some drop dead beautiful scenes of the Bad Lands.  There are some great old time photographs of the cowboys, local folk and animals.  There are some interesting nuggets of information about Theodore  Roosevelt.  There are also some scenes and themes that are used over and over and over and over. I found I was checking the remaining time often and thinking it should have been shorter.",1359849600,,396,4.779411764705882
