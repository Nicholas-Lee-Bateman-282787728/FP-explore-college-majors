8144629,4,B000IAZOGW,"This disk contains two pieces: Android 207 and Table Kid Kirby. I saw TKK first, a five-chapter story of a clay animation. The little clay man comes to life on, and is trapped on a workbench. Across the room, and utterly inaccessible, a mysterious machine stands silently ... All five of these vignettes offer cleverness and imagination, if not the most polished of technical presentations.

A207 has a more professional look to it, but the same rough charm in the three animated characterss that appear. 207, the main character, wanders through a seemingly endless maze, solving lethal puzzles and eluding another maze-denizen, a blindly destructive automaton. In the end, 207 finds his way to the exit, and then -- well, that would be telling.

Both of these shorts (color for TKK, B&W for A207) have a Kafka-esque sense about them: tabletop imprisonment for TKK, and the maze created by forces unknown in A207. More than just the setting of each movie, their endings (I'm still not telling) only reinforce that sense. This isn't a Spielberg blockbuster by any means; perhaps this disk came from student work, or from a skilled amateur. That's fine. Set your expectations properly, then enjoy these two quirky stop-animations.

Android 207 is one spunky little fella.  He does not look quite like an android.  His head, in particular, is a human skull, with pop-out white eyes.  His body, while robotic, is curiously human.  Especially his face: eerie, but human.

Our little hero finds himself, suddenly, in a vast maze.  The maze is filled with threats.  There are huge spikes that thrust out from the walls and then retract, pits to fall into, dangerous electrical bolts to fry him, moving try to crush him and, perhaps worst of all, a very nasty machine with rotating spikes is hunting him down.

There is even another android, hanging by its hands at the end of a corridor, who needs his help.

I'm a big Ray Harryhausen and Willis H. O'Brien fan.  They are the two prime movers in theatrical stop motion animation.  Phil Tippett and Jim Danforth are other well known names.  This Paul Whittington guy, making the most of his limited budget (the spikes coming out of the walls are just large nails), is as good as any of them technically, and superior to the last two in infusing his animation with emotion.

You forget this is a stop motion puppet.  Android 207 quickly feels real.  He is courageous, frightened, and compassionate.

The end of the film pulls it all together, but I am not a big fan of spoilers, especially in good films.  Let's just say that the film is an allegory of very real issues.  An allegory about work and its tests.  About manipulation and the big forces that try to control us.  About our lives in this society.

What more can anyone ask of underground writing?  So what if it's a film?",1173571200,3,1638,4.553264604810996
8144631,5,B000IAZOGW,"this is something i found on youtube, and i am so grateful. animation is

sweet when done well, and this dvd has 2 of the best stop motion has to offer. android 207 is a tale of a robot being tested in a maze, and tablekid kirby is the adventures of a clay guy stranded on a table. they are very entertaining, and include some extra goodies from the production.

although both shorts are just that- short, they manage to tell volumes more than most hollywood movies. you won't be disappointed!",1168819200,2,493,4.406593406593407
