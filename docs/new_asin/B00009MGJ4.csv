7991802,5,B00009MGJ4,This show is one of the funniest Britcoms ever!  Gordan Brittas could make a nun swear.  The chain of events that always unfold as a result of some noble Brittas gesture inevitably leads to the most outrageous and hilarious scenarios on TV.  I'd love to be able to get the rest of this series.  It just doesn't get any better than this!,1383696000,2,336,4.370967741935484
7991803,5,B00009MGJ4,"Brittas Empire is one of the very few comedies where I actually laugh out loud and I mean LAUGH.
When will it be available on DVD in the USA?
Or should I say, why isn't it available?",1318982400,2,182,3.945945945945946
7991804,5,B00009MGJ4,"Brittas and his cohorts grew increasingly insane over the seven series.  What started as perceptive character-based humor evovled into the madcap-comedy style of the thirties.  Both approaches are hilarious.  The cast is flawless to a man.  The characters stay true to themselves and become more interesting with time.  The one flaw is the loss of Laura towards the end of the series.  Her character grounded the stories and added insight.

I would have preferred it if the special which ended the fifth season had been the final episode.  I can't really say more without spoilers, so I'll just say that in my opinion it would have been a more satisfying ending than the one chosen by the producers.

I saw the first couple of seasons on American TV years ago and I can't understand why this series hasn't been released in the U. S.  At least those of us with region-free machines can now enjoy all seven series in the Region 2, PAL format.  (Reminder, these disks won't play on a standard U. S. DVD player.)

A true laugh-out-loud series in the vein of Fawlty Towers.  Gordon Brittas is the epitome of the ""man you love to hate"", and each of the supporting characters is blessed with his own particular brand of insanity.",1218585600,5,1222,4.68075117370892

I'll buy it up in a minute!",1172534400,6,183,3.945945945945946
7991807,5,B00009MGJ4,"I can't express how ecstatic I am that BRITTAS EMPIRE is now finally listed here at Amazon.com DVD. I'm not sure if this means a DVD release is definite, but at least it's a sure sign of hope that it's going in that direction.

This is one of the funniest British sitcoms I've had the pleasure to watch. Chris Barrie is simply brilliant as the infuriatingly endearing Gordon Brittas. Release all seven seasons and I'll buy every single one of them (although my favorites are seasons 1 to 5).",1142380800,11,491,4.51685393258427
