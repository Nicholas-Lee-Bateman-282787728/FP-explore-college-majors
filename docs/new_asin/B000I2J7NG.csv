8143798,3,B000I2J7NG,The DVD was in good condition.  But the content was a little disappointing.,1427068800,,75,4.769230769230769
8143799,5,B000I2J7NG,"Well this is my number one band in the whole world.  I grew up listening to these guys, I had a chance to see them just the other day on HD TV.  Great to finally see them play.  I have been drumming for about a year.  I have been spending alot of time play 8th and 16th's on the high hat.
Until I got this video, 1/4 notes on the high hat, is very cool way to play, in fact at first I had a hard time getting the rythm down.  If for no other reason than to play with one of the best 1/4 note high hat players in the World, buy this video.  The price set me off for a long while, but actually playing the songs and fills for the student to see is a great way to improve your technique.  Dont listen to the stoney's who don't know, rock with the best.",1255910400,,749,3.7628205128205128
8143800,4,B000I2J7NG,I liked it very much.  I was a little disappointed on how he explained the break down of the songs.  Other than that it is very informative and entertaining.,1194998400,,157,4.379310344827586
8143801,4,B000I2J7NG,"This DVD was very good. Simon shows how to play easy but intricate drum parts to great songs. It is very, very helpful to actually see him playing more than just listening. I had the most fun whem I met (and played along with ) at a recent Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp day last Sept (2006) in Columbus, Oh. This DVD proved that anyone who wants to, can play, and Simon's DVD is a great lesson.

Thanks, Simon.",1169856000,,407,4.151898734177215
8143802,4,B000I2J7NG,"This DVD reminds me very much of Neal Peart's ""A Work in Progress"" -- the DVD where he demonstrates all of the drum parts to the songs on Rush's ""Test for Echo"" album. This DVD reviews the drum parts to all of Bad Company's hits from the band's drummer, Simon Kirke. (It also contains a Free song as Paul Rodgers and Simon were members of Free before founding Bad Company.) I recently met Simon and had a private clinic with him in October 2006 and the information and drumming philosophy he shares in this Rockstar release is very representative of his style of teaching and personality that came through during our time together. (Simon is now teaching students privately at his studio in NYC.) As a drummer for a classic rock band, I found the opportunity to see Simon demonstrate the drum parts for all of these Bad Company songs to be extremely helpful in learning the parts to all of these monster classic rock songs. I would love to see many more similar products from other famous drummers via Rockstar! Well done Simon and Rockstar, GIVE US MORE!",1168300800,3,1055,4.587301587301587
