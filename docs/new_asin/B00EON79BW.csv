If one partner dies his share goes to the other partners! The inventor of a formula says he was cheated and he will get even. Miss Planchette calls the police. Oscar Swenstrom won't leave. The police arrive and find La Fontanne is silent! Chan arrives, too late. The radio is silent, a broken glass tube. Poison gas killed La Fontanne! Who had a motive? Birmingham Brown shows his comic skills. La Fontannes car is examined. Chan observes the cigarette ash, its from a South American cigarette. Can a sound frequency break glass?

Men arrive at Chans house, they attack Birmingham and Tommy! Chan arrives and talks to the three. He knows their real names. What does Chan know about their deal? The conspirators demand that Chan tell them the formula for the poison gas. A high-pitched sound can break a glass radio tube and release its contents! The power of suggestion works. Tommy and Birmingham defend Chan, the police arrive. Chan gets a confession from the killer, and explains how it was done. Then its back to San Francisco.

This is an interesting story. It warns about a business deal where rich investors can cheat a poor inventor. What can he do? The horrors of the Great War were due in part to the use of poison gas. There was an international treaty to outlaw this weapon, it was not used again in WW II. Nations kept their own supplies just in case. They had nerve gases that are similar to insect sprays.",1415059200,,2196,4.698701298701299
