2647606,5,B000HXDEVC,"The Blood of Jesus is a interesting movie as it depicts the dangers of the World that can draw young people into sin. The one thing that stands out for me was when the young girl comes to the crossroads of her life there was a sign in the shape of a cross. At first it was a cross with Jesus on it. Then as she got closer it was a cross with arrows to the right and to the left. The one on the right says,""To Righteousness"", and the one of the left says,""To Sinning"". This is Biblical if you look up Eccl 10:2. A wise man's heart is at his right hand, but a fool's heart is at his left.",1192579200,19,586,3.8114754098360657

2647608,3,B000HXDEVC,"My mother told me that she saw this film in a Black rural church in the 1940s, so I had the pleasure of watching it with her and reliving her memories. It's interesting in that it's a morality play based on a Southern Black version of themes of the afterlife and salvation. Spencer Williams (who also directed and is best remembered as ""Andy"" of ""Amos and Andy"") also provides some comic relief. While it is not likely to be taken seriously today by anyone aside from rural funamentalist Christians (due to the dialogue and extremely low budget), it is still very interesting to watch.",1007164800,11,585,4.634615384615385
2647609,5,B000HXDEVC,"Spencer Williams religious allegory, ""Blood of Jesus"", is an insightful look at African-American religious thought at mid-century. This gem of a movie focuses on the sustaining power of faith within a segregated  and marginal society. The story is one of a spiritual journey, in which a  young woman on the brink of death finds spiritual renewal by overcoming  temptations. Drawing upon Dante and Pilgrim's Progress, Williams crafted an  outstanding homage to African-American Christianity.",951868800,19,490,5.671232876712328
2647620,5,B000HXDEVC,"This is a glimpse into another era and culture.  Part of American history, but it seems as distant as a distant galaxy.  The picture of a small-town, literalist Christian community, and a woman killed and brought back to life is full of a certain spirituality that is not familiar to many of us.  The visions of heaven, angels, the devil and piety verses sinfulness are simplistic, but vivid.

As part of the black cinema of the era, it feels part of a subculture that is gone forever.  And that is a mercy in itself.",1434412800,,517,4.457446808510638

2647624,5,B000HXDEVC,"""Blood of Jesus"" and ""lying Lips""  are  examples  of an interesting and important but not often well remembered part of American film history, films made by African American directors, writers and actors for African American audiences.  These are two well made films.  It is interesting to see Spencer Williams (writer, director, producer and star) in an early role.  He later became famous as Andy on 50's TV ""Amos & Andy.""  ""Lying Lips"" was directed by Oscar Micheaux, the best known director of this genre, and stars Robert Earl Jones, father of James Earl Jones.",1416787200,3,566,4.957446808510638
2647625,5,B000HXDEVC,"I thoroughly enjoyed this depiction of black heritage filming! As with all movies we must discern the message that is being sent.  However, if one lacks knowledge of the war between good and evil, there is always the Holy Bible that gives the true reflection of the living God and what the blood of Jesus has done for those who believe by faith.",1403568000,,345,4.476190476190476
2647626,5,B000HXDEVC,"As a child, this was the only religious movie shown at our ethnic movie theater at Easter that featured Black actors.  I was elated to find it again and be able to relive the special memories of sharing this special production with friends and family; some of whom have passed away.  Thanks for the memories.",1396828800,,308,4.581818181818182
2647627,3,B000HXDEVC,"Lying Lips was much better than The Blood of Jesus. Disappointed to see how my people were reduced to a type of ""minstrel""role even in all black movies.",1377388800,,152,4.464285714285714
2647628,5,B000HXDEVC,"THE BLOOD OF JESUS is a rare gem. Thank God it's not out of print. This movie will influence elders as well as future generations of film goers and filmmakers.

2647629,5,B000HXDEVC,"It was so refreshing to see more movies being put out by early black directors showing stories about diverse things that just the normal portrayal of blacks as subservient maids and butlers. Because at lot of early black film was lost by the Tyler-texas film fiasco. But as far as i have been told that Oscar Micheaux's ""The Homesteader"" in 1919 is the oldest movie directed by a black man. There were other black directors like Noble Johnson, Spencer Williams and later on Gordon Park's and Melvin Van Pebbles. These movies are very well done and the actors were brilliant!",1334880000,3,574,4.75
