8120256,5,B000FBFYQO,"Ms. Choquette is, indeed, a diva and an extremely accomplished one, besides being an accomplished commedienne.  Here, she is accompanied by another great artist:  Conductor Charles Dutoit (sp.?)  I'm enjoying it tremendously.",1363046400,,225,5.96875
8120257,5,B000FBFYQO,"I ""discovered"" the singing of Natalie Choquette over 10 years ago in a small gift/music shop in Quebec City.  I was astounded by the incredible beauty of her sacred albums Aeterna, Aeterna Romantica and Aeterna Celesta.  Her lighthearted Terra Mia and Terra Bella albums in which she sings popular romantic tunes in about a dozen different languages are also delightful.  Two other multi-lingual young Quebecoise divas are not to be missed:  Florence K (Natalie's daughter) and Georgia Fumanti.  You can hear and see them all on YouTube.",1331596800,2,537,5.126436781609195
