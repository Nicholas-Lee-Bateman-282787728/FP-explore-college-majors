8195187,5,B000Q82USG,"DVDs were very good playing quality.  The translation is a little rough.  It looks like from Korean to Chinese and then to English.  It might be difficult for those who don't speak Korean, but you can follow the gist of the story.  The story and acting are excellent.  Choi, Jin-Sil made her comeback with this movie as ""Soon-Yi.""  Great drama and lots of tears; it makes you think about our own lives.  One of the best of the Korean dramas.  ""Soon-Yi"" deserved so much better.",1405641600,,477,4.529411764705882
