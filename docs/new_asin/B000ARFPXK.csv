8079088,2,B000ARFPXK,"I have to hand it to the people who made this unintentionally comedic video that they did try very hard and actually produced a video that got published.  However, the demonstration of the Venetian plaster technique and the results produced on-screen were much closer to something you'd see the Three Stooges doing.

I am a bit of an artist and certainly a craftsman in everything I do and I wouldn't be satisfied with what this woman produced.  What she does is definitely HOMEOWNER GRADE and NOT PROFESSIONAL by any stretch.  If my result came out like this, I'd quickly repaint the wall in utter embarassment long before anybody had a chance to see it.

My wife and I watched this video snickering and laughing the whole time.  My advice?  Save your money and watch the YouTubes and other free instructionals that are easily found on the web.  Venetian plaster is a very cool technique!  But this video should be in the ""contractor's humor"" section.  I didn't give it 1 star because it made me laugh.  Who could hate something funny?",1388707200,,1036,4.7
