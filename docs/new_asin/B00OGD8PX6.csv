6739157,5,B00OGD8PX6,"After waiting over 25 years, finally on DVD with the original music!!!  I made a night out of it and watched all 4 CD's.  It's the perfect set up for season 3.  Season 2 built the greatest adolescent love story ever but also told other stories along the way that will warm your heart and fill it with nostalgia.  Kevin Arnold is that guy that most of us relate to, not the most popular but not the underdog either, just the everyday guy with siblings he fights with, parents he doesn't always understand, and trying to find love like all the rest of us.  The effort put into making this series with specific details of the time make it a classic, the problems Kevin faces like every other teenager make it timeless.",1430352000,,715,4.386363636363637

By the way, if you've read lots of people saying how the quality hasn't been enhanced for the 21st century, well no it hasn't but it's as was and better than the pirate versions that have been doing the rounds for the last 15 years.

6739199,5,B00OGD8PX6,"Season 2 (1988-89) of ""The Wonder Years"" may not have resulted in a second straight Emmy for Best Comedy Series or a Top 20 ratings placement (it tied for #22), but it is packed with memorable episodes and moments, starting with ""Our Miss White,"" the one about Kevin's crush on his attractive and caring aspiring-playwright 7th grade English teacher (superbly played by Wendel Meldrum).  With its inspiring finale of on-stage Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy speeches (remember: this is set in 1969) delivered by children (the latter by Fred Savage as Kevin Arnold), this episode earned an Emmy for its director Peter Baldwin.  The episode ""Pottery Will Get You Nowhere"" (directed by the show's brilliant narrator Daniel Stern, doing double duty) gives Alley Mills and Dan Lauria (as parents Norma and Jack Arnold) their greatest moment together: a kitchen quarrel so realistic and deeply emotional that very few television dramas - let alone sitcoms - could ever hope to equal it.  In a superior protest episode to ""Walk Out"" (the Vietnam war demonstration one that feels a bit stilted and choreographed), the exhilarating ""Loosiers,"" which immediately preceded it, has Kevin taking down his militaristic and completely clueless P.E. teacher Coach Cutlip (hilarious recurring role for Robert Picardo) by extemporaneously transforming the usual, uninspired drudgery into a farcical fun romp on the basketball court.  ""Brightwing"" is flower-child older sister Karen's (the gorgeous Olivia D'Abo, who was ahead of her time on U.S. TV as a native Brit actor playing an American) chance to shine.  And the penultimate episode ""Whose Woods Are These?"" pits cold, commercial, adult interests against the warm sentiments of childhood, as the small local woods (Harper's Woods - where Kevin and Winnie experienced THE KISS first season) gets bulldozed to build a shopping center.

In addition to Wendel Meldrum (Miss White) and Robert Picardo (Coach Cutlip) making lasting impressions as faculty cast, Raye Birk stands out as the menacing, authoritarian assistant principal Diperna, as does Ben Stein as the monotone-lecturing, gloom-and-doom science teacher Mr. Cantwell (in a slight variation of his prior classic role in the film ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"").

Great songs abound (by Bob Dylan, Donovan, Cream, Simon & Garfunkel, Joni Mitchell, Judy Collins, Carole King, B.B. King, Smokey Robinson & Miracles, Diana Ross & the Supremes, etc.), but the most affecting in my opinion are two by the Temptations, ""My Girl"" and ""Just My Imagination"" (the latter perfect in ""Our Miss White"" even if chronologically inaccurate) and Nat King Cole's ""When I Fall in Love"" in the ""Pottery Will Get You Nowhere"" episode.

A bit on the down side, although both episodes were well enough done considered separately, was the near juxtaposition (only four episodes apart) of two nearly over-the-top bullying episodes.  The first features older brother Wayne (Jason Hervey) in full-on obnoxious and cruel mode; and the second has an overgrown, sociopathic junior high thug called Eddie Pinetti terrorizing and physically assaulting (with a brutal punch) little Kevin (credulity is nearly stretched to the breaking point by Winnie's seeing this demented character as boyfriend material - albeit not for long).  If there weren't already a ""jump-the-shark"" expression-coining moment going back to Fonzie and ""Happy Days,"" the Wayne episode (rather pretentiously titled ""Hiroshima, Mon Frre"") might have become forever associated with its ""vacuum-the-hamster"" moment.  The darkness of some of Season 2's episodes, starting with the ""Heart of Darkness"" opener that features yet another scary, semi-psycho kid character, is very likely what caused the significantly lower ratings than for surrounding Seasons 1 and 3.

The DVD comes with a colorful 16-page booklet containing a full-page introduction written by Fred Savage, brief summaries of all 17 episodes, and some additional bits of information or trivia (such as the fact that an eleven-year-old Robin Thicke appears [a couple of times] as an unnamed classmate).  Disc 4's bonus features include an eight-minute contemporary roundtable discussion with Fred Savage, Danica McKellar (Winnie) and Josh Saviano (Paul) about their own junior high education; a twelve-minute featurette on 1969 as the setting for Season 2; and 85 total minutes of illuminating and entertaining interviews with Daniel Stern, Alley Mills and Dan Lauria.",1423612800,7,4466,5.436416184971098
6739200,5,B00OGD8PX6,"Confused why this is for season 2 and it won't be available to 2015.  When you can already get season 2 on Amazon, which I already have.  But definitely worthy of 5 stars.  People complain about the ""fuzziness"" video quality.  Trust me, its not that bad.  Its just the way you saw it on TV for the first time.  In my opinion, the ""old"" look and feel add to the experience.  It takes you down memory lane.  Its very watchable.  Most the soundtrack is in tact as well.  Great show.",1417478400,4,479,4.222222222222222
