8591800,5,B001E6Q0V2,"I love this DVD. Fell in love with these two on the Royle Family and was not disappointed in this show one bit. You have to love Brit-coms and you need to have that knack for the dialect. This show is hilarious and, somehow, also quite comforting in its' simplicity. They wrote these characters with the same shrewdness they showed with the Royles.  If you are not into characters and if you do not prefer characters to action....you better skip this one.",1506211200,,455,4.548780487804878
