3663442,5,B001K98M3M,"The sound track for this is extremely well done and artistry is beautiful.  I have to admit that the plot seemed repetitive at first but did evolve into a greater story.  It was not bad guy and victim goes to hell in every episode.  I bet someone that watched the first few shows would have thought this to be repetitive.  There were a few shows that actually left me shocked and faced with some truths about mankind.  I'm older, so i am not saying this is an educational film, but it is a film that just might remind you of an old song.

This film is not like spirited away, shana, witchblade or even hellsing where there is an obvious plot.  Clearly, the majority of episodes can stand on their own without the others as short stories, but as the series moves on there is a move away from the short stories to something more intense.

I watched this with my daughter.  It does have some strong content for kids, but she is grown up enough to handle some foul language and bloody graphics.  We had fun burning though the 6 DVD's.  It was her that pushed me into watching this after seeing it a few times on TV.

Five stars may be slightly generous, but the production is very well done.  It is just the plot that is lacking some.",1244246400,3,1230,4.2727272727272725
3663443,3,B001K98M3M,"""Hell Girl"" is an anime that introduces a very interesting idea: what if, for the price of damnation (a guarantee of being sent to Hell upon your death), you could immediately send a tormentor you utterly despise to Hell? Although there are recurring characters and the back-story of the main character (Ai Enma), the heart of the show exists in an episodic format that shows different people in different situations of torment, most of whom ultimately end up making the decision to use the power of Ai. Fans of ""Paranoia Agent"" will recognize this type of format easily (as well some similar mood and feeling).

This is not, in any way, a humorous show, and the anime does not shy away from showing the torment and the subsequent victims' revenges upon their tormentors. The best executed parts of each episode tend to occur when the vengeance is finally enacted, although there are exceptions (the final episode is, in particular, an emotional and well-enacted story).

The main problem with this anime, one which makes it so I will not continue my patronage of the show, is that the episodes tend to be too long. The first episode, for example, draws out the scenes of torment until you reach the point of exasperation, just hoping that the tormented will finally get on with their revenge. That may be designed to reflect the difficult nature of the decision the tormented must make, but it makes for a difficult and often ponderous show. There are shows with similar formats and even themes (such as ""Paranoia Agent"", for example), which manage to make this work much better.",1243900800,2,1580,4.805147058823529
3663444,1,B001K98M3M,"Stupid me. I hated the first volume then bought the set. And I still hated it, hoping it would get better. The series is just too repetitive and a real story doesn't kick in until very late. Very terrible indeed, I should have listened to one guy who use to review here. Seriously, you can buy something blind folded and pick anything better than this. Terrible series, made me very grumpy.

3663445,4,B001K98M3M,"The horror anthology series has a long history.

Although the anthology format has almost disappeared in the US, it still retains its popularity in Japan, especially with horror.

""Hell Girl"" (A literal translation of the Japanese title,""Jigoku Shojo"") is a great horror anthology series, steeped in traditional Japanese folklore.  The Hell Girl herself, Enma Ai, has her name taken from Enma-O, the judge of the dead who balances the karmic scales and sends people to hell.  She rides in Wanyudo, a flaming oxcart wheel with a man's face in the center that is said to be the traditional method of transport to Hell.  Wanyudo is also one of Enma Ai's companions in meeting out vengeance, along with Hone Onna, the Bone Woman, and Ren Ichimoku who is a tsukumogami.

Each episode is essentially a new story, following a standard pattern.  Someone is being victimized, and so they go to a website called ""Hell Correspondence,"" where they enter in the names of the person they want revenge on.  Enma Ai then appears, and hands them a straw doll with a red string around its neck.  She explains that if they pull the string, who ever they have a grudge against will be sent immediately to Hell, but in payment the string-puller will also go to Hell when they die naturally.  This compact is sealed by a sign upon the string-pullers chest, showing they are hell-bound.

The stories range from common problems like stalking and bullying to irresponsible doctors and uncaring mothers.  Some of the episodes are cut-and-dry, but some are more complicated such as when Enma Ai refuses someone because their ""rage is not strong enough.""  Later, some of the back story of Enma Ai and her group are revealed, such as how Wanyudo came to join the group and the relationships between the Hell Group.  In Episode fourteen, Takuma Kurebayashi is introduced, who becomes a continuing character in some linked stories later on.

""Hell Girl"" was a hugely popular series in Japan, with two more seasons as well as a being adapted into a comic book and a live-action TV series.  The following series still have the anthology format, but go even deeper into the Enma Ai's story.

Funimation's ""Hell Girl"" release contains all 26 episodes of the first season, packaged onto four disks in slim cases.  The presentation is really beautiful, as lovely as the animation inside.  There are some nice bonus features, like a video character profile of Enma Ai that was used to promote the series, and a round-table discussion with the Japanese voice actors on what the series means.  There is also a live-action music video, a ""Making of"" that video, and a textless opening and closing.

I thought ""Hell Girl"" was a great series. I love Japanese folklore, and it was great to see it so well-handled.  I hope Funimation keeps up with the series and delivers the next two seasons!",1241136000,3,3536,5.810077519379845
3663446,5,B001K98M3M,"These are the final words a damned soul will hear alive before they succumb to Ai Enma and her deadly fragrant flowers that fall from her kimono.  This unfortunate human has been the target of supernatural vengeance. They committed some unspeakable acts of cruelty to someone who was able to summon Hell Girl because vengeance burns in their heart. Someone was willing to sell their soul to Hell for ""...the revenge one cannot exact alone"". The Demon, Hell Girl, will ferry the soul of your tormenter straight into the depths of Hell if you enter her covenant and promise her your soul also when you die..

This series is one of the best I have seen but it has many things going against it, Some of these may make this series unwatchable if you like lots of action or aren't captivated by the characters and concepts.  Repetitive and predictable plots, reuse of Hell Girl's dialog over and over, gratuitous amounts of violence and inhumanity.  It also employs some of the most overused character types in the genre; the super grownup child with special powers who communicates with Ai. Her irresponsible father is also widowed.  Her father is also a corrupt but good-hearted journalist who wants to stop Hell Girl and her revenge for hire service.

The way the entire production works is such a pleasure to watch that nothing detracts from it. I don't normally like this type of story and it took a few episodes to grow on me. The animation is top notch. The creepy way Hell Girl looks in a black school girl's uniform unsettles me. The beautiful backgrounds are works of art. The musical score is perfectly matched to the mood of the scenes and defines the characters like operatic motifs. The opening and closing animation sequences and the accompanying songs I watched for all 26 episodes I enjoyed them that much.

The stories follow a formula much of the series. Single self contained shows that show someone being wronged so badly by someone they summon Hell Girl who gives them a way to get the ultimate revenge, sending that person straight into Hell.  Mixed into the episodes are subplots such as the reporter and his daughter and the reason behind Hell Girl's interest in them.  Another sheds light on why Hell Girl does what she does.  There are numerous other threads woven in the episodes.

Miss Ai lives in a ephemeral place with her shinigami assistants and her kindly grandmother.  The English voice actor for Hell Girl does an excellent job, delivering her lines without emotion, perfectly in character.

The last three episodes are combined to form a final story that wraps up the subplots, adds closure and also promises of more to come from this series.

I don't know if another season is coming, it would be difficult to top this.  Hell Girl reminds me of Witchblade or Speed Grapher for story quality and content. It combines Western and Japanese elements in a very unique way and should be enjoyable to non-anime fans who like scary stories with lots of psychological intensity.

Not much nudity, less than one scene per episode, but many scenes per episode of violence and cruelty.  Not much swearing outside of the use of the word ""Hell"". And there are some scary scenes with Hell and its evil minions.  And the series overall is grossly violent and depicts nastiness of every type which is difficult to watch at times.

Some reasons for using Hell Girl's ""Instant Karma"" method are questionable at best. Mistakes are made and even redemption and salvation are possible but few black straw dolls are returned unused to Hell Girl.  Most pull the scarlet thread for some reason plus their desire for vengeance.

I rarely write reviews of anime because everyone has their own tastes and I doubt I like what most anime fans like. I feel a need to promote it because I enjoyed each episode so much.  This is really good adult anime that has all the elements for greatness. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1238630400,5,3930,4.706569343065693
3663447,1,B001K98M3M,"This is a perfect example of a story that has potential, but does not develop at all. Each episode copies the same basic plot as the last. The stories are meant to be strong and meaningful, but it's all thrown at you and predictable that it's easy to lose interest on. Some scenes are actually just repeated episode after episode, like the entire ""I am hell girl"" ...and the chariot of fire scene. It loses its flavor quickly when you know this will happen every story. What I don't get is that there is 26 episodes of this medicore anime, but great animes like Elfen Lied and The Melancholoy of Haruhi Suzumiya only have 13 episodes. It's like what you want more of, you get less of and vice versa. The good things about this Anime is that the art is drawn very well, but it clashes with things like a Dawsons Creek themed opening, and pop music playing throughout the anime, then they finish it up with more Dawsons Creek music. It just doesn't fit the idea of something called ""Hell Girl"".

Not to mention that Funimation must have had everyone in the office call out sick when recording this because Laura Bailey plays almost every female character... matter of fact its like they have the same 4 people doing the voices every episode. That may work out well in an Anime that has main characters! but when every episode is baised around New characters and the events around them, why must they sound the same as the characters from the last 20 episodes? Hire some new people already!

Overall Hell Girl is a medicore thriller at best.",1238198400,5,1538,4.508960573476703

I bought this anime on another friend's recommendation, and it is an okay anime.  It was a little slow at first, but then it starts to pick up towards the end of the volume.

Every episode revolves around this premise.

Jerk terrorizes people, person is victim, person hears about ""hell correspondence"", person logs on and types name in then freaks out like they regretted it.  Hell girl shows up, gives person doll, tells person that if they pull the string, they will go to hell when they die, but the person they want revenge on will go to hell immediately.  Person holds on to doll a while, person gets pushed to the limit, person pulls string, bad guy goes to hell after an elaborate scene made of stock material reused episode after episode, and a few animations of the bad guy running away, and then the victim seems happy as they look at the black hell mark on their chest and go on with their lives that are suddenly all ok now that the bad guy is in hell.

It has a mix of a bit of feudal japan and modern day japan. I have seen both seasons of Hell Girl and working on the third. If you love a bit of horror,fantasy, and suspense then this series is wonderful for you.

Your main character is Ai Enma who is known as Hell Girl(or Jigoku Shoujo), and has a website that is ONLY available at midnight. People who wants revenge types in the name of the person who deserves to go to Hell. She will come possibly at that instant or later on and will hand you a black voodoo doll with a red string around it's neck. She says that once you curse some one by getting revenge you will also dig a second grave and once YOU die you will also be sent to Hell, but thats after you die by normal causes in life. She will disappear and watch you to see if you'll pull the string. She will exact your revenge and send your acquaintance on a ferry boat to Hell and give you a mark on some part of your body (usually on the chest) to show you that was your payment.

About the pain and suffering of an innocent person who seeks revenge on the person who has wronged them. I had a hard time getting into it with no characters to get attached to, but about half the way through just before I was ready to give up on Hell Girl something happened. A plot began to form. A freelance journalist and his 10 year old daughter were introduced. Hajime, the freelance journalist, was investigating the Hell Girl phenomenon; and his daughter Tsugumi, who had a psychic connection with the Hell Girl, began following the people who were seeking revenge and tried to talk them out of it. Their interference was quite an annoyance to Hell Girl and her servants. After Hajime and Tsugumi got involved the story got really good. I don't think I've seen an anime that so thoroughly bummed me out in the first half, and rocked my world in the second half. His and Her Circumstances was the opposite. The first half rocked and the second half sucked. I would give Hell Girl 5 stars, but the first half was really a bore. I think 4 stars is generous.

Well worry no more, because despite the cheap price tag, the case is of a hard, clear, and thick plastic, much better than the flimsy thin cases we see all too often today. The DVDs are arranged in  such a way that they overlap each other, with two on each side. Not ideal if I want to pull out discs 2 or 4, but there is enough space between the discs that there is little danger of scratching them when handled properly. The spindles that hold the dvds aren't flimsy and don't feel like they are about to break every time you press them down to get your disc out, so I feel very confident about the packaging.

3663471,3,B001K98M3M,"UPDATE: Dec 2012 - Correct cover image now pictured.

On the set:

Relying on the cover image shown here for the past year, I thought I would be getting a pretty red set that might have multiple cases. Silly me -- usually the S.A.V.E. sets look little better than bootleg sets (though they are much better quality, the physical set and the video quality). So just be aware, what you will get ordering new from Amazon will be a single clear-hardshell case (with decent artwork), with 4 pretty discs arranged nicely within (it is good, solid packaging). I've uploaded a customer picture so you can see what that will look like. For a S.A.V.E. set, at a killer price, the set is great, but it is not what Amazon pictures (I have given my complaints several times and it's still wrong...).

On the anime:

Basically, it's all about revenge. Teens (or anyone accessing the website) can request Hell Girl to terrify whomever has wronged them, and send them to Hell, but in return they allow their own souls to be ferried to Hell. Yes, a little creepy. Yes, a little dramatic.

I might actually give the anime 4 stars, I'm not sure yet. I've seen the first 10 episodes or so, over the course of about 3 years. So, point -1, it's not something that will really capture you and pull you back. You won't dream about it then rush to finish it in one sitting to end the nightmares (uh, I hope).
+1 The artwork is pretty. I picked up an inexpensive poster of Jigoku Shoujo at an anime convention (and I only own 3 anime posters).
+1 The Japanese cast is good. I haven't tried English.
+1 for the Japanese cultural aspect, you can learn interesting mythology bits from this anime.
+1 It's a good anime to learn some Japanese, because of course it's mostly about school kids. You can watch (or re-watch) episodes without the subtitles and still get what is going on.
Which brings me to another -1: Hell Girl is the only real character, and she's not much of a character. She's mysterious, maybe a bit tragic, but you don't get a lot of her personality (so far?).
+1 You do care for the characters in the various episodes, but -- owing to the nature of the story -- they end up in Hell. It didn't take long for me to get a little tired of these people giving up their lives for revenge, although their situations were helpless enough you could believe they might resort to that.

Having sampled more than 200 anime series, I would recommend you to give this series a try. Ippen, mitemiru?",1321315200,4,2472,4.457964601769912

But it should be brought into consideration, that being said most of the issues others find with Hell Girl is the episodic nature of the show. The show has its formula of a disgruntled, abused, or angry person accessing Hell Link to get vengeance on the person that wronged them. We then watch their tale play out and eventually they are sent to Hell.

Those new to the show should know that the show doesn't have a true plot/point until the 8th episode, even this story is not delved into until the very end of the show. Just like people shouldn't look for Comedy in a Murder Mystery, people shouldn't expect anything beyond the self contained stories of each episode.

Onto the product itself, you get 4 DVD's in a single normal size DVD case using those hanging DVD holders. The artwork on the inside of the cover is very nice and I chose to flip the DVD cover inside out because I like the inner artwork more. The Dub is there of course and is very good, the episode ""The Cracked Mask"" is funny in english. We get a roundtable interview with the main Japanese Voice Acting Cast which is nice.

So if you understand the point of the show wanting to tell self contained stories then it is likely you will enjoy this show and for you a 4/5 rating is likely.
If you want a continuous story there are many shows with 100's of episodes out there to enjoy, so you'll likely be a 3/5.",1307577600,4,1505,4.310954063604241

You enter the name of the person you want punished and then Hell Girl appears. You make a contract with her and voila! the person you curse has their soul dragged into hell! What is the price of your revenge? Only the promise that when you die your soul will also fall into hell!

Hell Girl (Jigoku Shojo in Japanese) is primarily episodic in nature. Each episode is the story of someone's revenge. Sometimes, well most of the time, the person taking revenge has been horrible wronged and the law won't help them. But justice is so important to them that they sacrifice their immortal soul to get it. Over the course of the season, a reporter starts following the Hell Girl story and tries to unravel the mystery of Ai Enma's (Hell Girl) origins. At the end of the season you do get the beginnings of her story.

This is a very interesting series. The art work is superb and the revenge scene is always fun to watch. This is a horror series, but it isn't very scary. It is horrifying - the things that are done to the people that makes them want to take revenge. There is one episode that I particularly disliked because it was so sad (the baseball one, just skip it). Ai isn't very discriminating in who she helps get revenge. In one episode she keeps refusing the request of one person, but another time she carries out a revenge on an innocent person.

Basically she sends their tormentors to hell in exchange for the persons own soul once they die also going to hell. She has three companions who help her along the way and the series deals with all type of subjects like bullying,harassment and infidelity

The pros

Very interesting premise for an anime series or series period. To be honest I find some of the story lines in some anime more interesting than some of the live action shows I watch on tv. The characters are interesting and likable,Ai Enma and her three companions,Wanyudo, Honn Onna and Ren Ichimoku are the main protagonist,but there are a few others that are likable as well. The series has great back ground music which really puts you in the mode. The animation for the characters and back grounds is good and you will enjoy the work that went into it. Great series for people who like darker subject matter dealing with real life issues like stalking,domestic abuse,bulling and slander. It's great to watch something that doesn't always have to revolve around the standard things that you see in anime like dudes with giant swords and guns. This dvd is at a good price and has a number of extra features like round table interviews with the Japanese voice actors the full version of the opening and ending songs for season 1 plus promotional material. I almost forgot that the American voice actors are very good and I especially liked the person doing AI's voice. The option to switch to the original Japanese voice actors is there as well as the ability to have the Japanese voice actors with subtitles. Loved the box art which is something I usually don't care about.

The cons

As you have heard the show can get a bit repetitive and that's true. It didn't really bother me all that much,but might bother some. It deals with some pretty dark issues and might not be suitable for younger children. Also it doesn't really develop some of the more interesting characters like Ai's workers who help her with her jobs. I kept wanting to know more about them. Also I would have liked a few more episodes focusing on Ai herself. I also would have liked some interview with the American voice actors as well as the Japanese crew.

The conclusion

ALL in all a great series that's very imaginative and fresh. Likable Characters and a interesting plot. A great show that has some room for improvement,but highly enjoyable.",1290902400,,2494,4.6826484018264845
3663477,5,B001K98M3M,"On a Whim chance earlier this month i set the dvr to record hell girl on ifc. Not familar with this anime, but mildly versed in the anime universe(of course there's gazillons out there),i decided to check it out based on the title alone. Was this the eastern world's answer to our ""hell boy""? Well, it's not and that's a great thing. From the start i was completely smitten with this show. One of the big hooks for me was the music,which was gorgeous, moody and entirely set the tone for the anime. Even the theme song during the beginning title montage digs it's claws in you after several episodes. So what is this show about? Clearly, my opinion isn't solely based on ear candy. What this show offers is something entirely dynamic to me as newcomer to this kind of anime. Alot of the situations are very deep in scope and very down to earth. This isn't a flashy over the top action anime by any means. But a slowly unravelling tapestry revealing the nature of being human. Oh and of course, REVENGE. We learn quickly that there is a website called the hell link or hell correspondence. Wherein at the stroke of midnight a person can type the name of person they feel deserves to be sent to hell. Once, this is done hell girl will appear to that person offer them a straw doll with a string attached. It is then up to that person to go through with the damnation of another person by pulling the string. The catch is that when the ""puller"" dies thier soul is commited to hell as well, which is signifed by a tattoo which they'll wear til death. I enjoyed the premise and although i hear this is something that's been done before, i think it's pretty orginal. However, the real enchantment lies in the stories that gravitate and mesh with the formula. Yes, the show can be formulaic for episodes at a time. But, all the stories reside in deep human descion making. So many things are covered at such a sound level, it's hard not to find addicting. One episode can revolve around an insufferable selfish person, not willing to change, while another is about an abusive father. All the while the viewer is left to ponder does someone deserve to be damned?. The question, ""is this just or not?"" is one of the hallmarks of the show once the reporter(hijimae) and his daughter enter the story, and it works as a voice for the viewer. This is a special anime and one that i've enjoyed watching from beginning to end, it made for an oustanding halloween precusor. Thanks IFC!..",1287446400,,2471,4.469026548672566
3663478,5,B001K98M3M,"I will start off by saying that Hell Girl is a superb anime.  It has a deep plot, compelling characters, a wonderful soundtrack, and beautiful artwork. I was taken with episode 1 and carried until episode 26.  I'll just say it's been since Code Geass that an anime captured me like this.
Now a lot of the negative reviews have noted that the anime is repetitive, that all the episodes follow the same formula and as a result the show is boring.  If these are your thoughts then you were not watching it closely enough.  I'll admit the first ten episodes don't change their formula too drastically but in my opinion they're some of the best.  But I ask you, what is wrong with this?  This anime is about revenge, and the psychological ramifications of the harsh choices the characters are presented with.  For those who claim it is too repetative I'm curious as to what they are expected when they buy an anime called Hell Girl.  Has anyone seen House, that is one of the most formulaic shows on television and it's seven seasons of awesome.
This is an anime that when you watch it you should try to imagine yourself in the character's shoes.  For those who thought the characters were weak and summoning Hell Girl under pathetic reasons might think differently if they suffered as some of the characters did.  I'm not saying I would pull the red string but I'd sure as Hell want those who wronged me to pay.  When you act in the moment sometimes you don't think about the future.  In the episode Purgatory Girl, the old man talked about how his destiny to suffer in Hell had hung over his head all his life.  When he summoned Hell Girl and pulled the string, he felt justified but in the end he couldn't move on.  Some of the characters might be fine for the moment once they've made their decisions but I'm sure it will come back to bite them in the ass.
I might sound defensive with this review but it ticks me off when people bash something they're unable to grasp.  Japanese story telling is much different than English story telling and anime is no different.",1287360000,,2064,4.466666666666667

And Funimation did a great job, especially Brina Palencia as Hellgirl, and the voice translation to English by Funimation, while not always direct, was a perfect and an improvement and flowed much better than the subs.

Don't need to tell you what the story is about because there are already posts that describes it, except this is for mature audiences, and for those that like stories about vengence and moral dilemmas, and also I will tell you that it does start of a little slow, but then it will pick up and draw you in and won't let you go.  The first few episodes might leave you wondering what there is more too? --But keep watching, it is just a set up, and after awhile, you will be quoting and singing along with Ai Emma when, with her soft-eerily-silky voice, says: ""Perhaps, it is time to die.""

3663482,5,B001K98M3M,"This anime is by far one of my top favorites! It really makes you think about what you would do when faced with the same situations as the characters in it. Would you be willing to damn yourself as well as the soul of your tormentor? Would you reconsider, or sacrifice your own eternity for the sake of another? You are also shown how ugly people can truly be, and that is where the thinking comes in. Hell Girl always explains things very clearly to those who summon her but never tells them they have to go through with it. The decision, as she so bluntly puts it, is ALWAYS up to the person seeking vengeance. The anime also explores several different angles, some characters experience real regret, some do not. Sometimes innocent characters are damned under misunderstanding, and some clearly deserve it (but again, that's for the viewer to think on ^_^)

The animation is absolutely gorgeous, and the music is quite fitting. It never feels too dramatic and sets the tone very well. The voice acting is fairly good, with Hell Girl sounding cold, distant and enigmatic. You learn some about her as the series goes on but thankfully they keep things mysterious so you never fully get what's going on (even if you think you do) I'm on the last disc of the series, and will be sad when it's over.

Although the anthology format has almost disappeared in the US, it still retains its popularity in Japan, especially with horror.

""Hell Girl"" (A literal translation of the Japanese title,""Jigoku Shojo"") is a great horror anthology series, steeped in traditional Japanese folklore. The Hell Girl herself, Enma Ai, has her name taken from Enma-O, the judge of the dead who balances the karmic scales and sends people to hell. She rides in Wanyudo, a flaming oxcart wheel with a man's face in the center that is said to be the traditional method of transport to Hell. Wanyudo is also one of Enma Ai's companions in meeting out vengeance, along with Hone Onna, the Bone Woman, and Ren Ichimoku who is a tsukumogami.

Each episode is essentially a new story, following a standard pattern. Someone is being victimized, and so they go to a website called ""Hell Correspondence,"" where they enter in the names of the person they want revenge on. Enma Ai then appears, and hands them a straw doll with a red string around its neck. She explains that if they pull the string, who ever they have a grudge against will be sent immediately to Hell, but in payment the string-puller will also go to Hell when they die naturally. This compact is sealed by a sign upon the string-pullers chest, showing they are hell-bound.

The stories range from common problems like stalking and bullying to irresponsible doctors and uncaring mothers. Some of the episodes are cut-and-dry, but some are more complicated such as when Enma Ai refuses someone because their ""rage is not strong enough."" Later, some of the back story of Enma Ai and her group are revealed, such as how Wanyudo came to join the group and the relationships between the Hell Group. In Episode fourteen, Takuma Kurebayashi is introduced, who becomes a continuing character in some linked stories later on.

""Hell Girl"" was a hugely popular series in Japan, with two more seasons as well as a being adapted into a comic book and a live-action TV series. The following series still have the anthology format, but go even deeper into the Enma Ai's story.

Funimation's ""Hell Girl"" release contains all 26 episodes of the first season, packaged onto four disks in slim cases. The presentation is really beautiful, as lovely as the animation inside. There are some nice bonus features, like a video character profile of Enma Ai that was used to promote the series, and a round-table discussion with the Japanese voice actors on what the series means. There is also a live-action music video, a ""Making of"" that video, and a textless opening and closing.

I thought ""Hell Girl"" was a great series. I love Japanese folklore, and it was great to see it so well-handled. This S.A.V.E. collection gives you the same package at a cheaper price, and is a really great deal!",1268179200,39,3541,5.8

Initially most episodes are episodic in the sense that each episode is separate story in which the protagonist gets wronged by some individual, usually the antagonist and they end up contacting the Hell correspondence so they can enact their revenge. Which seems like a good idea considering the moral implications in the story but this gets rather repetitive. First 10-12 episodes I found myself asking, ""Is this series ever gonna pick up or is it gonna continue being episode after episode of characters being wronged and then getting revenge."" I mean the first 10-12 episodes seemed like just a different character with a different problem and then enter Hell Girl to enact revenge Ad nauseam. It wasn't until later episodes that two characters a journalist named Shibata Hajime, a former blackmailer, and his daughter Tsugumi where the series starts to get more in depth as far as plot structure. As you progress through the series you learn the reason why Hell correspondence exists or but its never that clear who's really pulling the strings. I suppose in season 2 & 3 they'll be getting more in depth with the story line. I suppose the viewer will also find out the background stories of some of the people assisting Hell Girl. Considering that this story didn't have such a horrible ending is a redeeming factor but the rest just falls flat. Like in series like Death Note the viewer is pushed to ask themselves, ""Do wrongdoers deserve punishment for their wrongdoing? Or is everything not always so black and white."" These moral implications make the premise a lot more interesting but in the end you must always pay a price.

Rating 1-10
Animation: 8
I would have hoped that with the punishment being Hell they would have made the initial punishments a lot more terrifying graphics wise but the characters and background settings are very well rendered.

Story line: 7
Like I said the first 10-12 episodes are extremely repetitive and at first watch I had to put this series down for a while and watch something else but eventually the story gets more in depth.

Characters: 6
Most characters who assist Ai Enma in Hell correspondence aren't given background stories and some of the characters who dish out revenge have background stories that really aren't that well developed.

Replay Value: 0
I don't think I'll be watching this again.

Overall Rating:
I gave this an Amazon 3 out of 5 because I just thought it was okay. At first watch it seemed like an interesting premise for an anime but it wasn't well executed at all. The ending was pretty good and it left me interesting in maybe watching the second and third seasons but hopefully it won't be as repetitive.",1264118400,3,2834,4.775510204081633
3663486,5,B001K98M3M,"SPOILERS -- sort of.

""Hell Girl"" is a series of loosely related stories about revenge by proxy and cowardice, very Japanese in its single-minded focus in the art, characters, and narrative on only a few moral themes. When is it right not merely to kill someone but to send them to scream in Hell forever? Enma Ai, the elegant and deadly demon girl of the title, warns you there is a price: YOUR soul is also forfeit if you untie the red thread that signals your contract with Hell to take your resented enemies to a dark and eternal afterlife.

Each episode tells a different version of a story where someone accepts this bargain. I have read bored fans who say that ""Hell Girl"" is slow, annoyingly repetitive, and never really makes any progress. And it is true that if you want demon battles, sword-swinging monsters, and raging hormones, you shouldn't bother with ""Hell Girl."" You are likely to be bored witless by these stories of desperation - bullied schoolgirls, terrified victims of vicious psychological blackmail, helpless frightened people who see no way out - and of why each turns to the dark paths of the demons to seek a freedom they cannot see how to reach otherwise. But ""Hell Girl"" was not made for fans of sword-swinging demon-and-hero stories. It is far subtler and - make no mistake about this - a great deal creepier. These stories get under the skin of one's mind and crawl around in there. (That means ""Hell Girl"" is NOT for children.)

In parallel to these stories is the story of Enma Ai herself, and of a reporter and his daughter who are trying to track her down. No spoilers here: this story is riveting and thoroughly satisfying - and in some ways much creepier than all the other stories (which is saying a lot).

The animation and plotting has the curious effect of making us want to reach into the story and shake up people. So we are caught in a bind as well, trapped by the same helpless desire for revenge that we are simultaneously watching. Don't underestimate the capacity of these stories to get at you. And throughout, the same moral question: is it right to seek revenge by demonic proxy - and be sent to Hell for it - or is it better to defeat not one's enemies but one's own cowardice? Beware of the knee-jerk answer: ""Hell Girl"" quite convincingly shows us, over and over, why people do not refuse Enma Ai's offer. ""Hell Girl"" is not a horror anime - it's much too sophisticated for that. It's unique in narrative, character, animation, and moral framework - not a nice story at all, but very powerful, like Enma Ai herself.

Highly recommended.",1261872000,2,2591,4.587473002159827
3663487,3,B001K98M3M,"I don't normally review anime series because I don't consider myself a guru at it.  I watch a lot of animes and like many differnt types, but I still don't consider myself fair judge of the stuff.  But, here goes anyway.  Hope this helps a few people.

We waited and waited for this series to come to the USA, in the complete first season.  The animation looked wonderful, the idea of the series sounded dark and deep, and the voice for HellGirl seemed right on.

Upon entering the HellGirl realm, the animation is still really good, but the storyline needed a huge boost in script.  The first two discs were barely worth watching, but the third disc and further were really interesting and kept me hooked.  You've got to be patient with this one.

Disc 1 and 2 were the introductions to the main characters, explaining situations where someone might want to exact revenge on someone else, so they log into a site that is only available at midnight, send a message to HellGirl with the person's name.  HellGirl almost instantly appears and she gives them the option to send someone to Hell- but the trade ""the price"" is that when they die, they too will be sent to Hell, so it'd better be worth it.

The characters in Disc 1 + 2 were wanting.  Most were teenaged kids who didn't really comprehend what they were doing, sending a fellow classmate to Hell because they embarrassed them, or sending someone to Hell because they weren't friends anymore... (rolls eyes) kids stuff.  You almost want to laugh and say ""get over it!"" but... many teens don't understand that life goes on, so maybe it's a little truthful.  But, to be honest, I was hoping for some really dark and morbid episodes (which don't happen until about Disc 3)  You don't get to the really GOOD ""worth it"" Hell-bound stories until Disc 3, where (for example) two lovers are forbidden to see each other because her aunt says no.  The aunt plays voodoo with the male lover and is threatening his life.  The aunt is psychotic and comes after the two of them... yesh, it'd be worth it to me to send her to Hell if to get just a few years of peace.

I read a different review that mentioned that there was a lot of repitition, and I want to explain that one: HellGirl had a really hard time getting picked up as a series in Japan, so it had a lot of Pilot or ""sample"" episodes while it was trying to get signed on.  This is the reason for the repitition- the repeated scenes, the repeated lines, the repeated fire chariot and sleeve/flower explosion, Hell's gate, etc.  Really.  After the first two discs, the show is really pretty good.  By disc 3, it reminds me of ""R.O.D."" and in some ways ""His and Her Circumstances"".  The artistry is pretty good, the storyline thickens as Purgatory Girl is introduced and the research/ investigation resumes.  The supporting, repeating characters really helped to boost the script.

So, overall, this first season is okay.  As a whole, it's a 2.5 star season.
Writing: 2 stars
Animation: 4 stars
Potential: 5 stars (c'mon, dig into the scary depths of your mind and let it out! we want to see!)

If you can be patient, watch this.  If you can't, skip it- cuz it's really only worth the watch halfway through.
Similar darkness, watch instead ""Paranoia Agent"", ""Lain"", ""Noir"", ""Akira""",1257724800,4,3282,4.564102564102564

3663490,4,B001K98M3M,"Hell Girl - 8-8.5/10

I saw that I could import the R1 box set for 20. I did so.

Prior to buying the box set, I had watched the first ten episodes; I got the first two R2 volumes for a few quid. I found the series to be very watchable simply because revenge stories are always involving and each episode provided a new story, but there wasn't enough connecting the dots for me to love it - there hadn't been any character development whatsoever for Hell Girl and her crew. The quality also went up and down a lot; as expected of an episodic title.

The first half of Hell Girl focused on black and white revenge. What made the victims vengeful was shown, the victims then went on the net and entered the name of the person they wanted to die, Hell Girl then appeared and gave the victims the tool required to cast the curse, the victims then received one last push from the person they hate required to make them want to give up their own soul for revenge and, finally, Hell Girl and her servants ended the episodes by first punishing (often unintentionally comically) and then ferrying the cursed, evil people to hell on a small boat. Very repetitive; even the same dialogue was repeated by Hell Girl when giving instructions and the like.

The second half mixed things up slightly by introducing a private detective (of sorts) called Hajime and his daughter; a daughter that shares a connection to Hell Girl that lets her see through Hell Girl's eyes from time to time - allowing her father to track down Hell Girl's 'clients' in each episode. Her father, as luck would have it, sees revenge as wrong and, at first, felt the need to try to stop Hell Girl. The new investigation angle did freshen up the stories, with them told from the viewpoint of Hajime rather than the victims - adding mystery. There were other changes, too, such as the revenge stories no longer being black and white; sometimes 'good' people got sent to hell in order to justify Hajime's anti-revenge/Hell Girl ramblings, these 'good' people not getting the cosplay punishment sequences. But the best thing about the introduction of Hajime and his daughter was the inclusion of recurring characters with actual development; not just faces with nothing below the surface. Hajime even got an episode to himself that explained his back-story and why he was so against revenge - it made me feel sorry for him.

Ignoring the reappearances of Hell Girl, her three servants and the father and daughter duo, there weren't any connected episodes in terms of story until the last three, which were all about Hell Girl's past, finally revealing a little about her to the viewers. Until that point, she'd been no more than a doll; there to punish upon request and repeat the same lines without any emotions. Seeing her tragic background and seeing her show an emotion - anger - transformed her from a blank slate and into an actual person. And, as an added bonus, her story connected Hajime and his daughter to her, making their inclusion not as random as it appeared - I thought they were no more than characters threw in to extend the story.

If not for some very poor episodes which departed from the usual formula, mixing in unnecessary extra supernatural elements - like a talking doll with control of plant monsters and Hell Boy (don't ask) - I'd have rated it higher. Those few episodes added nothing, only lowering the overall quality. There were also some standard revenge stories that weren't very good, but most of the 'normal' episodes were at least watchable, and even if they were poor there was always another, totally different story right around the corner.

One non-plot/character point that deserves to be mentioned is the music. It's unique to my ears; some kind of eerie techno/rock stuff. Whatever it's classed as, it's very good, and it made the talking sections of the episodes even more watchable.

Overall, providing you don't mind episodic series that aren't comedies and are forgiving enough to excuse a few drops in quality and silly punishment sequences, it's a must watch. It gets better the further you progress. It did bug me that little was revealed about Hell Girl until the end and how school girls always seemed to be playing the roles of victims (school girls sell DVDs), but I came out of the series thinking highly of it. I'll definitely be watching season two at some point.",1253577600,,4378,4.684005201560468
