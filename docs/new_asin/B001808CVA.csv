Everything about the production from a visual standpoint (art design, animation, direction) is first rate. It's not Makoto Shinkai quality but it's definitely above average. They did a great job with the ""love story in snow"" visual design.  The music was fine, although nothing outstanding.

The story was also very good, moving in places, and worked well as a fairy tale.  It was very melodramatic like Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien.  Unfortunately it also relied heavily on tired, lame plot devices like terminal illness and car accidents.  The comparison with Makoto Shinkai seems apt because part of the story reminded me of a narrative theme from The Place Promised in Our Early Days, the theme of lovers who are separated by some circumstance but who are connected through dreams. I also had a hard time accepting that so many girls would be into a guy like Yuichi.  He is definitely a ""playa,"" having had a history with or getting involved with five chicks. You could definitely tell this anime came from one of those ""choose your babe"" PC games like Kimi Ga Nozomu, or School Days.

Overall this is an enjoyable anime, not the best of its genre, but one of the better titles from the last few years.  The DVD volumes all had some behind the scenes documentaries, which were informative and entertaining.  They featured several interviews with the director explaining what went into each phase of the production.",1220313600,,1558,4.754646840148699

Edit: I thought I'd throw this in for people that don't follow anime news and are confused about the scarcity of these DVDs and the unknown release date for volume 6. The American distribution rights for Kanon have recently been transferred from ADV (who released volumes 1-5) to Funimation. There is no set release date for volume 6 or for the re-release of volumes 1-5, but rumor has it that Funimation will just redistribute the original DVDs (including volume 6 as it is likely to have been finished) under their own branding instead of dubbing the entire series again.

I hope that clears up any potential confusion.",1210204800,9,1068,6.845588235294118
