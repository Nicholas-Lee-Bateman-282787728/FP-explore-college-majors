2614064,1,B000GIWS2Y,"I agree with the other reviewer. Unless you know nothing about Neil Young or like to hear critics talk about how important their opinions are (The guy from the Village Voice for example) avoid!

I'd love to see the whole BBC concert that they take clips from. How do I get that?",1172361600,8,278,4.346153846153846
2614065,1,B000GIWS2Y,"This is a bad joke. Who wants to see 10 second clips? I'm sending my copy back to Amazon and requesting a refund.  FWIW, I've been a Neil fan since 1967. I had a bad feeling when I read the ""this is unauthorized"" disclaimer on the back of the DVD.  It is unauthorized and a total waste of time unless you've lived in a cave for forty years, and if that is the case, you wouldn't care anyway.",1172188800,7,391,4.0
2614066,4,B000GIWS2Y,"""Neil Young: Under Review 1966-1975""  is a rockumentary that examines this prolific artist during his formative years in the business and at his creative best. The experts weighing in on the pop icon in the film are authoritative and carry a lot of weight.

 John Einarson, author of ""Neil Young: Don't be Denied,"" is particularly erudite and insightful about the singer-songwriter's Canadian musical roots. Christgau, rock critic and senior editor of the Village Voice, is entertaining, although he takes his shtick a bit far when he says Young's ""On the Beach"" is a great record if you can imagine it as one being made by an artist masturbating by the fireplace.

 Critics Nigel Williamson, Dave Zimmer and Johnny Rogan also are in fine fettle and have done their homework on Young. They combine to shed insight on the genesis of Young's career and musical style.

 There's also some short --  too few and way too short -- clips of Young performing, most notably on BBC and during his Unplugged Concert in LA. Many of the other clips were taken from Young's ""Rust Never Sleeps"" concert video, which occurred three years after 1975 and is a performance any Neil Young fan of note already is familiar with -- or should be.

 All told, this documentary is a worthwhile effort. It does, though, fall somewhat short in the telling. We learn a lot about the music, but not enough about the man. And that's too bad -- because he is worth knowing.

 For instance, we are told that Young wrote some of his best songs when his personal life was in turmoil. The audience, unless they are already avid fans, are left in many instances to guess about the causes of that personal upheaval.

 Clearly, Young was affected by his parents' divorce. That is given short shrift in this documentary. He had polio as a child. I don't recall that being mentioned.

 Yet those experiences, among others in his formative years, surely contributed to the artist's sense of social alienation -- that feeling of otherness or standing apart -- that is alluded to in so much of his work. Any exploration of his troubled relationship with his first wife, Susan, and later with actress Carrie Snodgrass is similarly lacking.

 Even so, the experts do a good job chronicling Young's development as an artist and pontificating about the hallowed heights he reached that later led to his inclusion in rock 'n' roll's pantheon of greats -- the Hall of Fame.

 A nice DVD extra: The Hardest Neil Young Digital Interactive Quiz. I didn't do too well. But I kept retaking the test until I got it right. I hope filmmakers will continue to explore Young's life and genius in documentaries until they get it right.

 This one is a nice, albeit incomplete, effort. Give it a view.",1172188800,6,2739,4.734177215189874
2614067,1,B000GIWS2Y,"I seem to remember a goofy date like this on the most recent Yes concert DVD, ""Songs from Tsongas""...and that one took about a year and a half to actually show up...

on the other hand, Young IS finally starting to release bits of that trumpeted archive set of his, so maybe this is a legit release (coming at some point, anyway)...",1164067200,4,332,4.354838709677419
2614068,5,B000GIWS2Y,"I have just come back from the year 2025 and the DVD is still selling strongly. Not as well as Gilbert O'Sullivan's Greatest Hits, but pretty well considering. The most recent 2023 version shows clips from his stormy two-year term as Prime Minister of Canada.",1163721600,15,259,4.777777777777778
2614069,1,B000GIWS2Y,"Has anyone heard of this DVD release?

It sounds very intriguing though I doubt its validity. Why does the release date state December 31st 2025???? Does this mean it is not real and/or will never come out?",1162684800,3,206,4.5675675675675675
2614070,2,B000GIWS2Y,"Decent collection of comprehensive footage from the 10 yrs in Young's career. But the film is mostly ""analysts"" discussing Neil's career. Thye are not even his colleagues like other band members or band members from other groups. One guy is even revealing what songs he likes and dislikes. Who cares? Especially because he isn't anyone significant to the industry. I may as well have made my own video with my friends since i'm already familiar with his history. As i see, it could have been a money maker.

If you've read ""Shakey"" or any CSNY books, or have watched other videos of either Neil or any band he's played with, you'd already know all the information they discuss. In this video, you never hear Neil himself discussing his body of work. When some songs are played, there's useless irrelevant scenery, like an aerial view of some town being panned from a plane or helicopter.

If you are interested in Neil Young and/or his work and don't know too much background information, this would be a good video for you. But if you already have other books and sources of information and basically know his background, this video will seem redundant. You would be interested in a one-time only viewing. Either way, this video should not be priced more than 10 dollars.",1174262400,12,1272,4.751131221719457
2614071,1,B000GIWS2Y,I returned this product when I read in the newspaper that this CD is actually NOT a Neil Young peroduct at all!! Do not buy it if you expect to see and hear a lot of Neil Young ...  Neil Young did NOT authorize this product.,1174003200,,224,3.869565217391304
2614072,1,B000GIWS2Y,"Pure GARBAGE.  Looks like an undisguised attempt to make money off of Neil's talent and fame.  Had I known, I never would have purchased.  Zero stars, mostly interviews with nobody's.  Very little performance time by Neil Young.  It's so bad I can't give it away.  DO NOT BUY.",1174003200,10,276,4.645833333333333
2614073,1,B000GIWS2Y,"We watched this last night and we couldn't believe what a rip-off. No concert footage except for maybe 10 seconds and then a bunch of know-it-alls, (who look like they never went to a concert in their lives) talk endlessly about it. Wish I read the reviews before I spent good money on a piece of garbage. Now I'll have to wait awhile before I can justify spending any money on Massey Hall.",1173830400,6,390,4.3561643835616435
2614074,2,B000GIWS2Y,"being a die-hard neil young fan for years, i neither learned anything new i didn't previously READ, or see anything i haven't previously seen.  still giving it two stars because neil young is the topic.  i would give the same credit to an hour of neil eating popcorn.",1173139200,4,267,4.541666666666667
2614075,5,B000GIWS2Y,"No revelations for serious fans.  Mere snippets of performances.  Even so, I think that this documentary provides an important service by noting key artistic influences and developments in Neil Young's dazzling, dizzying body of work.  My impression is that each of the ""talking heads"" personally treasures at least some of the music under consideration, which ends with the album Zuma.  I hope that this DVD will entice casual viewers to delve deeper and find their own treasures among the bounty.",1172966400,4,498,5.1875
2614076,1,B000GIWS2Y,This video is boring.  Not sanctioned by Neil Young.  Just talk and no Neil Young music.  I'm sorry I bought the DVD.,1172793600,8,117,4.2272727272727275
2614077,1,B000GIWS2Y,"As others have noted, this is nothing more than talking heads pontificating and a few brief clips.  If you are a true Neil Young fan, you will learn nothing new from this pedestrian documentary.

Save your money for the Massey Hall set from the archives.",1172793600,23,254,4.622222222222222
2614078,1,B000GIWS2Y,"This is the worst piece of rubbish I've ever been conned into buying! If you want to watch a bunch of unauthorized Neil Young biographers talk about Neil for 88 mins, knock yourself out.

The unseen clips have all been on YouTube and are a lot longer there than the few seconds you get on this DVD.

It took me about 10 minutes to realize I'd been had!

This is NOT an authorized Neil Young release.

I was unbelievably disappointed after waiting in anticipation for this to be released.

I wish I could give it -5 stars!!You have been warned!!!!",1172707200,16,546,4.42
2614079,1,B000GIWS2Y,"I agree with the past couple reveiewers.  I have been a hard core Neil Young fan for many years and this film served up little information that was new.

Concert clips were interesting but far too short.  I would love to see the complete source of some of these clips.

And enough of Robert Christgau or ""Xgau"" as is he sometimes called or as he likes to self-proclaim himself ""The Dean of American Rock Critics"".  ""An artist masturbating by a fireplace?""....what does that mean?  How can a listener interpret these kinds of comments as relating to his listening experience?",1172534400,6,574,4.747474747474747

8132819,2,B000GIWS2Y,I thought I was getting a DVD of Neil Young and what I got was a video of critics talking about his career and 2/3 seconds of Neil Young singing.  I was so disappointed!,1371427200,,169,3.9705882352941178
8132820,5,B000GIWS2Y,"I disagree with many of the Amazon reviewers here who slam the DVD because they did not like or agree with the producers and critics included. For one, Christgau was indeed one of the best and most published rock critics of the 70s-90s. All of the others featured know Neil's work from this decade very well, as do I, since I own everything he has ever recorded. Why are these Amazon reviewers complaining about the concert footage included? This is titled: ""Neil Young: Under Review"", so what do they expect? They can obtain numerous concert DVDs on Netflix or download Neil's videos on YouTube. This is a partial analysis of Neil's enormous body of work. I too have my favorites, as do they, even though we disagree on many. Nevertheless, they offer some fun and useful info of the versatile rock icon who never ceases to amaze us with his discography and his involvement in music over the past 50 years. A big thumbs-up to this first volume, and to Neil Young. I am eager to view the next volume (1975-2006).",1343174400,,1011,4.5911602209944755
8132821,2,B000GIWS2Y,"This DVD has a few interesting (but too short) fairly rare clips.  Another reviewer wrote that they can be found on YouTube in longer versions.  Mostly for completists, but completists probably already have the clips, and won't learn much from the commentary.  (In fact, hardcore fans may notice at least one historical inaccuracy.)  I guess that doesn't leave much of an audience for this DVD.  Do yourself a favor and fast forward over obnoxious blow-hard Robert Christgau's comments; you are far more likely to be annoyed by him than to learn anything from him.",1242518400,,564,4.957446808510638
8132822,1,B000GIWS2Y,"I was excited to see this DVD as soon as I noticed that it supposedly included live ""music"" clips from 1966-1975.  Thinking that it might offer rare shots of Buffalo Springfield, clues about Springfield's unreleased album ""Stampede,"" or even a few insights about the failed project with CSNY circa 1974, I looked forward to viewing it.  I wanted to see more Neil and less journalism.  Instead, I watched a seemingly endless number of aged rock critics--their extensive book, record and CD libraries in the background--expound about the music.  If you are a fan of Neil and watch this, you will understand why he doesn't like people writing or compiling stuff about his life or career.  If you are a fan of Buffalo Springfield and CSN and CSNY, it will make you angry how these ""intellectuals"" spend one hour and twenty-eight minutes in tiny lessons of semantics.  I get angry over the fact that I wasted an hour and a half with such dribble.  It gets a one star from me, because ""no star"" doesn't seem to be available as a rating.",1182470400,9,1030,4.657458563535911
8132823,1,B000GIWS2Y,"I really regret buying this one. We all should have realized how bad this was going to be when we saw the cheesy cover.  I guess I has hoping this was going to be a video pre-cursor to Young's much heralded ""Archive"" series.  The makers of this video probably thought they could make some quick cash on just such an assumption.

There ARE some good commentators on this, Johnny Rogan and John Einarson for example, are pretty knowledgable.  However, everyone on this is dry and dull and some of the so-called ""experts"" don't know what the hell they're talking about. The least I expected was accuracy.  One of the ""experts"" claims that the Springfield wouldn't ""let"" Young sing ""Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing"".  Yet, according to Einarson's book, co-authored by Richie Furay, Stills and Furay re-arranged the song before the Springfield even got together and Young loved their arrangement!

Too many things seem ""off the cuff"" on this video.  A good editor would have taken out the comments that are baseless and stuck with just the facts.

But, even if all of the commentatators were accurate, this would still be a dull and lifeless ""biography"".  Awful!  I wish Young could sue the distributors and get this thing off the market.  It diminishes him somehow.",1176681600,10,1261,4.841121495327103

8132826,3,B000GIWS2Y,"I agree with a lot of other folks who say this dvd could have been a

whole lot better. The comments by Mr Rogan,Mr Einarson & Mr Zimmer are

especially insightful but there is not enough footage from 66-75 that hasn't

been seen before. I thought there would have been more early CSNY stuff but there wasn't and The RUST NEVER SLEEPS clips were incongruous with the time frame listed in the title. If you are a Young Devotee, you have heard it all before anyway. The guy from the Village Voice has tunnel vision and Stephen Stills is NOT from New York City. A mediocre primer.",1174608000,12,577,4.373831775700935
