3961875,2,B002OMIKMC,"I am one to buy The Biggest Loser dvds. In fact I feel like Ill be missing something if I dont! However I probably should have looked into this one more before wasting time and money.

Routines: The routines themselves were decent, although not very challenging. Tara's cardio segment is probably the best one since you really get your heart rate up for almost the entire 10 minutes. The rest were just mediocre. Flailing weights around....proper form was barely discussed. The amount of reps weren't even on each side and Ive felt like ive ""been there done that"".

Trainers: This was the biggest downfall of them all. Without reading the back in detail, you have no way of knowing Bob isn't the trainer. This really knocked the appeal down---big time! Although the contestants were halfway decent and they obviously really tried, they still felt short. The appeal of buying workout dvds is to have people (trainers) instruct and guide you...not just any old people who have lost weight. If thats the case, maybe *I* should make my own workout dvd. Again, they don't talk about proper form, were clumsy in their words, and if i had to hear another ""Im proud of you"" I might not believe it. In Sione's upper body workout with weights he mentions how we are ""burning a ton of calories"". Uhh no we arent...in fact barely at all in that segment. Bob and Jillian always said you must work upper and lower together constantly because working arms just doesnt cut it. It was also frustrating to me to hear them talk like they knew what they were talking about, when it was words just to fill in the silence.

I hope Jillian's 30 Day Jump Start is better than this, because they really let me down this time. Bob come back! And at the very least if you dont, get your picture off the front cover!",1262217600,2,1788,4.56386292834891
3961876,3,B002OMIKMC,"I have several of the Biggest Loser workout videos and have been beyond impressed with the level of fitness required to work out, amount of sweat I put into it and the results that I get out of it...but not this DVD.  I would have rated it lower, but I actually DO feel a tad exercised, though not to the level that I would prefer.  I want to leave a video feeling tired but energized, but overall, feel like I worked OUT.  I did feel a little sore, though not by much.  I will say that the ""instructors"" feel very ""green"", the cue times are laughable, barely a count down and I was often left feeling frustrated that the segments felt rushed, clumsy and unprofessional.  I guess if you are a beginner and LOVE the Biggest Loser casts from the past, this is the way to go...but if you really want to work your fanny off, I would say skip it and go for one of the Jillian Michaels videos...those make you work it!  It was also disappointing that Bob wasn't there...it sure did need a touch of his direction!",1262131200,5,1006,4.268421052631579
3961877,4,B002OMIKMC,I use the dvd in the morning and the 10 min i spend is GREAT.,1262044800,,61,3.1333333333333333
3961878,3,B002OMIKMC,"I was a bit disappointed with this DVD.  It is far easier than any other biggest loser DVD's.  This DVD would be best for true beginners, if you've been working out for even a few weeks, I'd say skip this and go for Bob's Boot Camp, Last Chance Workout, or the Vol 1. and Vol 2. workouts.
Bob not being a trainer with being featured on the front cover is a bit misleading.
The contestants seemed fake and the constant bickering between Tara and Sione was annoying, not motivating.
There are 5 workouts, each 10 minutes with warm out and cool down in each, so really the workout is only 8 minutes.  Not being able to combine the workouts without fast forwarding through the warm up and cool downs was also a let down, and creates a lag between each section while you find the next area to start.  I don't know about you, but I don't want to be using the remote in the middle of my workouts.
I gave this 3 stars because I do think it would work for true beginners, just starting to exercise for the first time.",1262044800,,1008,4.234375
3961879,3,B002OMIKMC,"Its good in that it gives you a different workout for everyday to motivate you to do it everyday.  But I don't like that it deceives in thinking that Bob is the trainer like the other Biggest Loser DVDS.  BOB IS NOT THE TRAINER, the biggest losers are the trainers on all of the workouts.  The workouts are broken up into 10 minute mini workouts and rearragned depending on the level and the day you choose.",1261872000,,407,4.328947368421052
3961880,5,B002OMIKMC,All I can say is if they can do I can do it. Great work out!!!! Easy to follow and it is very inspiring....oh and perspiring!,1260921600,,125,3.8461538461538463
3961881,4,B002OMIKMC,"I have to agree with the other reviewer that I was hoping for another dvd with Bob as the trainer. I have always found his dvds to be high calorie burners and extremely motivational due to his warm yet strong training style. But one thing about the Biggest Loser you know if you watch it is that many of the contestants go on to become trainers themselves and they did choose some good trainers for this and it does mix things up a bit. However, with Bob at the center of the picture, one would think it's the same as past dvds...Bob does give diet and motivation tips on the dvd but does not train you as a trainer.

CALORIC BURN: As far as calorie burn, like the contestants on the show I wear a Bodybugg (the black electronic gadgets on arm bands) which measures my daily caloric burn. Because of this, I am also able to measure exactly how many calories I burn per workout and how many calories I burn per minute of any workout. This enables me to compare how effective a workout is against the many other workouts I own. I mention this only so you know what I say is based upon scientific measurement rather than perceived exertion.  I bought the other new Biggest Loser dvd which is Jillian's ""Last Chance Workout"" at the same time I bought this one so I was able to compare both as well as compare them to the previous Biggest Loser dvds, all of which I already own. While this had a decent calorie burn, it wasn't as high as many of the other ones already out, nor was it as high as the other new Biggest Loser dvd released on the same date. (Jillian's Last Chance Workout) However, I actually ENJOYED this one more in some regards because I like the fact that it used the medicine ball and bands that I have and rarely have a good workout to use them with...you could do the workouts with just weights, (and not all workouts use these so you may not ever use them at all) but this adds interest for me and prevented boredom. Still, it has a higher burn than many fitness dvds (Biggest Loser and Jillian's dvds are all pretty good on calorie burn) so it's a good addition to my collection.

If you are looking to do the segment with the highest calorie burn, choose Alli's ""cardio 2"" which also combines weights. The lowest calorie burn on this dvd is Sione's upper body workout. While I typically don't quote how many calories I personally burned because it's going to vary per person based on muscle density, height, weight etc...just to give you a guage of how extremely low it was...I burned only 23 calories in his segment. No, I didn't forget the third digit. This shows why you need to combine 2 of the ten minute workouts on this dvd rather than just doing one in order to achieve any results.(the others were WAY above that one.) Unfortunately, the dvd does not allow you to combine segments easily. I'll get to that in a minute. (If you combine Sione's and Alli's you will get a good burn and that's what I do. For a good workout combine one of the cardio segments with another of your choice.)

CUEING: The instructors all have their teaching methods down, in spite of the fact they were contestants trying to lose weight themselves not long ago. Beginners will be able to easily pick up steps but those more advanced can tackle the more strenuous moves and enable their own fitness level to increase. You will not only know how to do the steps, but how to do them safely as well and correctly so they are effective.  Good training. Good energy. A good combo of moves.

STRENGTH AND CARDIO: I love the dvds that contain a combo of both strength and cardio, which you will find here. Not all segments combine the two. You can do just cardio or cardio and strength. Cardio burns the most calories in the shortest amount of time, but strength training enables your body to keep burning more calories long after the workout is over and develop more muscle which also increases metabolism and allows your body to burn more calories even while at rest--in spite of the fact that you burn less during the workout with strength training.  The most effective workouts have been shown to get your heart rate up in its target zone, then switch to muscle building to add strength while it's still high, then go back to cardio and you'll get this here for double the results.

MARKETING: They titled this dvd the same as their 30 day jumpstart book and their new website to lose weight of the same name. You don't need any of the others to coincide with each other but dang that show is good at marketing. (grin)

MUSIC: Upbeat and to the pace of the moves. Keeps you motivated and revved.

SEGMENTS: 5 10-minute segments. 50 minutes total The calorie burn in a ten minute segment is not going to be enough to make much difference unless you combine two segments and make it a 20 minute workout, according to my caloric measurement. In this case, you'd get a good workout. Unfortunately, the dvd only allows you to choose one routine at a time unlike most of the other Biggest Loser dvds where you can pick a few to combine in the beginning. And, because some segments are all cardio with no strength, you'll burn less overall than the other Biggest Loser or Jillian dvds that combine the two for a deep calorie blasting circuit workout. I don't want to do a routine that ends in a cooldown then start all over again with a warm up in another segment when I'm already very warmed up but you have to if you want to do more than a low calorie burning 10 minute workout...odd that they did this on this one. It's like they only wanted you to do a ten minute segment and nothing more rather than being able to combine two.

MUSCLES WORKED: This is very well-rounded and hits 'em all.

EQUIPMENT: hand weights, a stability ball (the large air filled ball you can sit on--optional, you can do the moves standing or on a Bosu), medicine ball (this is a small weighted ball. Optional. You can use anything weight including a gallon of milk which is their suggestion or a large can of something like beans. I varied between my kettlebell and my medicine ball.) bands, (optional, you can use your hand weights) floor mat for ab work

NEGATIVES: Although I appreciate the trainers and their excellent moves and cueing, it still felt slightly as though this was their first workout dvd...because it was. There was just a faint of nervousness...although there is nothing I could pinpoint exactly to illustrate this...they did a great job for someone new at doing a fitness dvd but there was a slight air of discomfort on camera and in showing others the moves I gotta say. I would have loved for Bob to have at least done one segment but I applaud the contestants for doing well under their first spotlight..

ALTERNATIVES:
Should you progress to wanting a higher calorie burn but the same great instruction, cardio and strength training, you might try:

(in no particular order):
1. Body by Jake Total Body Workout
2. Jillian's Banish Fat, Boost Metabolim and Last Chance Workout
3. Kathy Smith Build Muscle Shrink Fat
4. Crunch Total Resculpt
5. Star Trainers: Strength
6. Weight Loss Cardio Sculpt with Violet Zaki

CONCLUSION: Few dvds kept up my interest as much as this one did and I love it for that because it will keep you coming back to it. However, the calorie burn wasn't quite as high as its predecessors for only being able to do a 10 minute run and not combine two segments easily and I was a little surprised to see trainers with less experience leading the moves rather than Bob but I can't fault them...they did a nice job in spite of some discomfort showing. If you only have time for a ten minute workout, I'd skip Sione's. His instruction is good but the calorie burn won't even cover a bite of something. Combine his with one or two others for good results.",1259798400,95,7772,4.470380818053597
3961882,5,B002OMIKMC,Great workout.  Taught by past biggest loser. You really work up a good sweat. Worth the money,1259712000,2,94,4.529411764705882
3961883,4,B002OMIKMC,"What happened to Bob?? He's my favorite trainer from this series and even though his picture is on the cover (as Jillian's is on the Last Chance Workout) he does not lead any of the exercise circuits.  I missed him. (He does show up giving motivational/diet/training tips)

Anyway, this DVD has 5 (five), 10-minute workouts with a short warm-up/cool-down included in the 10 minutes.  Tara leads the first Cardio section.  It includes marching, jumping jacks, knee-up (low or high impact), twists, etc.  Liz and Daniel provide beginner modifications.  This is a good place for beginners to start.

Ali leads the second cardio section.  I like this one because it includes resistance to get the heartrate up and keep it there.  You will need a weighted ball, dumbells, and/or resistance bands.  (Daniel again provides beginner modications.)  She does punches with weights, side lunges with a medicine ball, squats with weights over head, etc.  A good full-body workout.

Sione leads the third upper body section.  He again starts with a short warm-up emphasizes your upper body and core.  He then uses weights and a large stability ball (or workout bench) to work the biceps, chest, back, shoulders, etc., and ends with a stretch.

Ali leads the lower body section starting with a warm-up and then completing lunges, squats, side, lunges. ""donkey kicks (on hands and knees) and ends with a stretch.

Tara and Sione end the DVD with an ab and core workout.  Again, the warm-ups and cool-downs are included in the 10 minutes, so if you want to get a constant workout, you'll have to skip between sections.

All three of the instructors are encouraging and keep the class flowing, but there seems to be a ""charisma"" missing with them that Bob supplies.

Also included in the DVD is recipe booklet and an offer for a free workout music CD if you have an MP3 program on your computer.

This DVD is not as tough as the ""Last Chance Workout), but if you skip the cool-downs and work harder on the warm-ups, you can make this a continuous flowing session.  That's what I miss about the programmable DVD the Biggest Loser produced before.  It had a warm-up, cool-down, section and then you were able to group all of the cardion sections (or strength sections) together for a personal workout.  That said, this is still a good workout.",1259712000,19,2323,4.808080808080808

At the start I was unable to really do the full workout, so I was glad they had a guy in the back doing a ""easier"" version of it all. For the first 20 days or so I followed that person - and did the easier workout, and I will admit I was VERY out of shape, and on more then one occasion I had to pause it to catch my breath.. but after following this video for 30 days I went back and did it again - this time telling myself I would do the normal full workout with out the pausing, and I did.

3961941,4,B002OMIKMC,"There's a lot of negative reviews saying this workout is too easy.  It seems that a lot of the reviews are coming from people that are in shape, which is nice, but not who this is meant for.  It's titled ""30-Day Jump Start"", not ""30-Day Boost"" or some such, so of course it's for beginners.  Even the tag under the title says it!  ""10 minute workouts to get you started"".
This helps people get moving without a lot of stress, and in the comfort of our own home.  Yes I am overweight, and no, I don't routinely exercise and I have a desk job without a lot of walking.  I was quite ready for it to be done at the end of the 10 minutes.  No, maybe it didn't burn a lot of calories, but my calves were letting me know they were being utilized at least.  It is a good video for what it is intended for.  When I feel comfortable I'll switch off to Cardio Max, which is what I started off with when I lost weight before, because it is more intense (the warm up alone used to leave me winded!).

Even though the program is divided into quick 10 minute workouts over the 30 days, they were brutal and had me struggling to keep up. I'm not totally unfit either. I can do a full 4 mile workout with Leslie Sansone, no problem. But the high impact aerobics in this program had me struggling to keep up and had my joints begging for mercy. I'm not very overweight either.

I pop the DVD's into my laptop, sign on to IFit, put the laptop on the treadmill and run the Biggest Loser DVD.

3961961,2,B002OMIKMC,"I don't watch the show, so I didn't have any familiarity or expectations with the 'cast.' I bought this because the premise appealed to me: short workouts over 30 days to develop a workout habit and achieve a baseline of fitness.

What a letdown! None of the exercisers seem to have any sense of rhythm. They're out of sync with the music and even with each other, which makes it difficult to follow. The two who are performing modifications aren't consistent either, e.g., they seem to each have their own version about how a given move should be performed. Add to this the generally 'lost' look that all of them share, as if they don't know what's coming next and they're waiting to find out, and this DVD becomes unnecessarily hard to follow smoothly.

3961962,5,B002OMIKMC,"I am the laziest person in the entire world, honestly I hate exercise. To make things much worst I love food , just writing this made me want a double cheese burger with bacon and fries mmmK bacon!!

I enrolled in several gyms, and made the owners very rich, because I punctually went once a moth to pay and that was it. I also tried tennis, racket, karateK never lasted more than a couple of months.

I bought a elliptic machine (we also have one in the office), a stationary bike, weighs a bike and they are all there sitting in my family room ruining the view or in the garage.

I also bought CDs with sculptural good looking models and guys that looked like the thing from fantastic four. Those guys and gals have no empathy, and think that the people that buy their CDs are professional athletes or dancers. The routines were just too fast and heavy for me, I was done in 15 seconds. A complete wa$te.

If this sounds like you, I hardly recommend this exercise CD (see the picture).
It has something for every day of the month (Sunday is rest), routines are done by real people and pace is gradually increased. You will be able to do the whole 10 minutes or at least be close enough to do it, so you don't loose motivation. I am really enjoying it. My wife and son are doing it too, we made it sort of a family thing.

If you are good at sports, do exercise regularly and are an adrenaline junky this is not for you!! You will find it too easy. This is truly for beginners who do not have a lot of time in their hands, and want to do some exercise for their healths sake.

3961990,3,B002OMIKMC,"I have many of the Biggest Loser DVD's and compared to the others, I would say this one is so so.  It is fun to see the contestants leading the way, but their insturction are not as good as Bob or Jillian.  I had convinced my friend to join me for the 10 min work outs (as it says on the front of the DVD).  It's hard to come up with an excuse not to take out 10 mins a day to work out.  But I didn't realized that the second week ment 20 min work out and so on.  That isn't normally a problem, but that ment we had to get up 10 mins earlier every week.  I do like the mix up of exercise every day, and I enjoy working out with the contestants.  I beleive as long as you put in your full effort you will get a good work out.  If you are starting out - this is a good DVD to buy to help build you up.  If you are already in shape, I recommend you not buy this DVD.",1267574400,,863,3.6216216216216215

3962014,2,B002OMIKMC,"I don't want to ruin anyone's motivation for working out.  I so wanted to like this DVD.  I was a big fan of Tara and Sione and so was looking forward to working out with them.  HOWEVER, and this is a big however, the instructions for this video, the transitions between exercises, the counts are very rough.  The inexperience of the trainers is evident.  Bob & Jillian are not training you!

I am used to working out, have used Leslie Sansone, the 30 Day Shred, etc.  The experienced trainers/exercisers on those tapes have shown me you can push yourself and, if you use proper technique you will ""feel the burn"" but not injure yourself.  If you try to keep up with the transitions in this video, the brisk pace may cause you to move too quickly from one move into the next.  If you are not a beginner and you try to keep up, you will feel the jerkiness between one move and the next.  I thought to myself, ""well, it's not Bob and Jillian but these are all good exercises and the pace is excellent"".  HOWEVER, I was surprised as anyone to find that I ended up with a back of the neck muscle pull that has taken 3 weeks to heal.

Again, I'm not a beginner and this tape may be encouraging to beginners but I feel I must post this review and warn others, proceed with caution, learn the routines (which will mean stopping and starting in between exercises) and THEN go for the burn!",1264377600,5,1381,4.310077519379845
3962015,3,B002OMIKMC,"I LOVE the Biggest Loser Workout DVD's, there is just something about how Bob looks into the camera and I feel like he can really see me so, I work out all the more harder. When I watched the season with Tara on it, I was very inspired by her. However, after buying this DVD and after 10 minutes of hearing her teach I CAN'T STAND her. Her voice is grating and I feel like the sections are very amaturish. It just does not feel put together for me, not like the other ones have. Bob, doesn't train at all in this one and there are some annoying commercials at the end however, you don't have to watch them if you don't want as they are under a menu.

Good points of this workout DVD are:

If you can only do short periods of time, this is the DVD for you. Each section is 10 minutes long and you can do one each day. When you build up some endurance, you can start to do more than one section at a time. The DVD does feature a menu that helps you with that.

At the end Bob Harper does have some tips. I found these tips very helpful and for that reason I am glad I bought it and watched it...however, not glad enough to keep it.",1264291200,,1129,3.9647577092511015
3962016,4,B002OMIKMC,"The main purpose of buying this DVD would be for one of two reasons: one, you're ready to get in shape again but have heard how tough the Biggest Loser DVD series is. Two, you've been working out for awhile and you want to keep it up on a (near) daily basis - but you don't always have the time or energy to do a full 30-60 minute workout.

This DVD includes five 10-minute programs, all of which incorporate a brief warm-up and cool-down. Two cardio levels (one with weights, one without), and programs focused on abs, upper body, and lower body - although being the Biggest Loser, most programs integrate all of these things. Despite only being 10 minutes, each program definitely gets your heart and your breathing revved up - these aren't workouts for the weak at heart, even in a condensed form.

Interestingly, despite what the cover may imply, the DVD does not feature Biggest Loser's Bob Harper as the trainer. Fan faves Sione and Tara, plus obnoxious first female winner Ally are the stars who take turns hosting the programs - sometimes even within a single segment. All three of them do a passable job, but lack the ease and motivation of Bob or Jillian. Tara is probably the most spirited, Sione is the most natural, and Ally is just irritating as per usual - she also comes off as the most nervous despite her constant desire to give every move more than 100%.

Overall, having used various workout dvds for the last 9 months, I'm glad I own this one. It might not burn an excessive number of calories, but it's perfect to throw on when I have only a bit of time to work out and still enables me to feel like I'm keeping up with my workout goals. Plus you can do more than one program if you really want to workout for longer. As I said, it's also great if you want an introduction to the Biggest Loser style of workout dvds - a challenge to be sure, but the bite size portions make it worth it.",1263600000,,1908,4.369014084507042
3962017,5,B002OMIKMC,"This video is obviously for beginners -- people who might consider applying as contestants on the Biggest Loser -- and as a beginner video, it does exactly what it's supposed to do.  It has sections to strengthen each part of the body and sections to improve cardiovascular endurance.  It it intended for couch potatoes who are just now getting off the couch to try to improve their health. As a bonus, it is cut into five 10-minute sections that can be strung together in any combination as the viewer's fitness improves. Most of the people who gave this video a negative review either do not understand the word ""Jumpstart"" or they were disappointed that Bob was not leading the exercises.  If you've been working out with Jillian's videos or with Bob's other videos, you will probably find this one to be too easy.  While the former contestants who lead the exercises are not as polished as Bob or Jillian, they do an adequate job leading the viewer through the exercises.  If you want to know what correct form looks like, just watch Ali Vincent doing each exercise, as her form is flawless.",1263513600,2,1095,4.682291666666667
3962018,2,B002OMIKMC,I own all of the Biggest Loser Fitness DVD's and all of Jillian Michael's DVDs.  I bought this one thinking that Bob was going to be the trainer and was very disappointed that Bob wasn't in there at all. Although I did sweat a little (but I did all 5 10-minute segments)..the trainers are very new to training obviously...their cues were awful and I felt that I had to watch the screen at all times to find out when they were starting the next move and what it would be.  I really didn't like this DVD and am considering giving it away as I really don't like the workout.  If only Bob had been in it.,1263254400,2,600,4.155172413793103
3962019,3,B002OMIKMC,"I'm not a fitness expert...so consider my thoughts through that lens.

Jump Start would be a great introduction to the nuts and bolts of workouts. In ten minute increments the participant is given a decent building block of exercises. The participant starts out with 10 minutes a day, and works up into 30 minutes a day. There is a cardio, upper and lower body workout. The same workouts are repeated during the week, however, not back-to-back day-after-day. The following weeks build on that first week's schedule.

Biggest Loser's Bob Harper shares some healthy eating and inspirational information that is building block and common sense as well. The exercises are led by Biggest Losers winners (not all THE Biggest Loser but several favorites who've personally won through changing their lives.) This in itself is inspiring because anyone who watches the show knows where those folks started. And it is encouraging to see folks who are now in great shape still talking about hating a certain exercise or breathing hard/sweating while working out.

I think Biggest Loser fans who aren't currently exercising would make a good choice in getting this DVD. It could be helpful. and a great introduction to exercising and learning the nuts and bolts of how and why certain things are done certain ways. Anyone who is looking for a killer or very difficult workout won't likely be challenged though. I rented it and won't be buying it because after a week, I found that I wanted a little more change-up. Bob's advice was freeing and encouraging and I appreciated what I learned from it.",1262995200,,1584,4.947368421052632

3962021,1,B002OMIKMC,"I pre-ordered this item before it had a description because I've loved the Biggest Loser workout DVD's in the past.  As a result, I did not realize that it would be led by past contestants instead of the trainers.  Last night I finally decided to give it a try and was incredibly diappointed with the workout, the pace and the instructors.

The workout seemed very poorly organized.  Each individual 10 minute segment has its own warm up and stretching, so if you're doing a string of 3 or 4 all together, just as you're getting going after the first 10 minutes, you have to slow down for a stretching and then do another mini-warmup at the beginning of the next segment.  Also, the transitions between exercises within each segment take too long, so my heartrate did not stay elevated.

The instructors/past contestants are ones I enjoyed watching on the show but I did not care for their teaching style; the instructions for the exercises were poor and there was little instruction on proper form.  Countdowns were non-existant or wrong (e.g. on one exercise we're told ""just a few more"" but they stop after 1 more and another ""just a few more"" required another 10 reps or so).

I was originally going to recommend that this could work for someone who is just beginning a workout regimen, however there are some challenging exercises mixed in with a beginner pace, so unless a person is already fit, there are several exercises they won't be able to do.  If a person is already fit, I don't believe they will recognize the benefits they are accustomed to from other great workout dvd's.

For beginners, I would recommend the Biggest Loser Cardio Blast and Sculpt from several seasons ago or Tony Horton's orginal Power 90 (not P90X).  For intermediate, I recommend Jillian's 30-Day Shred, Banish Fat/Boost Metabolism, and the Last Chance Workout that was released in tandem with the 30-Day Jump Start.",1262649600,2,1903,4.7889908256880735

I was pleasantly surprised that the workouts are broken up into weekly routines. I like that the actual contestants from the show are the people doing the exercises on the tape, it makes me feel like a normal person when doing the workouts with them. I have done half of the workouts on the DVD and I have really enjoyed them. They are simple but effective routines that anyone new to working out can do easily.
