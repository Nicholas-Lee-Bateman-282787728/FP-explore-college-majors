5406298,5,B00AAJ1MR6,Good Western with a twist. A must see. The suspense is maintained till the end. Nicole Leigh gave a very good performance.,1359244800,,122,4.590909090909091
5406299,5,B00AAJ1MR6,Very interesting time setting and great Cinematography. The twists and turns in the plot make Shroud a great movie! The ending caught me totally by surprise!  I loved the ending!,1358121600,,178,4.933333333333334
8549179,5,B00AAJ1MR6,Excellent quality movie just what I wanted to see.,1445904000,,50,4.666666666666667
8549180,3,B00AAJ1MR6,"Strange but imaginative movie marred by the fact that the heroine, a well-brought-up Dutch woman, spends much  of the film wearing an evening dress in the daytime, which she would have known better than to do.  I get very annoyed with producers that assume their audiences don't know about these things.",1435881600,,303,4.921568627450981
8549181,4,B00AAJ1MR6,"Enjoyable treatment and mixing of genres.  Enjoyable story with obvious effort made to create a realistic Post-Civil War period.  The movie begins with what appears to be a ""traditional"" Western story plot and gradually evolves (devolves?) into something much darker.

There are definite areas for improvement a larger budget would likely have resolved, but overall a fun twist on the traditional western with some great action scenes, dialog, and creative photography/angles.

Shroud won't win any Oscars (nor was it competing at that level), but it is an enjoyable Friday/Saturday night be at home ""Get out the Popcorn"" entertainer!",1370736000,,634,5.438775510204081
8549182,2,B00AAJ1MR6,"A widely well conceived film that had very good attention to detail and design - like in the costume and prop department.  A lot of work was spent making a believable world to pull you in.  However, somewhere around the middle of the film, the writing takes a nose dive and despite a good effort by a group of indie actors, the film never really manages to come together.  The cinematography was sweeping and professional, but unfortunately, small sensor cameras were used and with no depth of field it feels like you're watching a soap opera shot for daytime television instead of a serious cinematic feature.  Towards the end, there is a lot of exposition and plot dropping by the characters to tell us what's happening - which was also very heavy handed.  Overall, the film could have used a longer script overall and maybe a team of writers as opposed to just one.  I think this might have saved the film which started out really strongly.",1365033600,2,943,4.616766467065868
8549183,5,B00AAJ1MR6,Good story with a beautiful lead actress who wears armor.  What more can a guy ask for?  One of those movies you need to just enjoy for what it is.,1362787200,,147,3.8666666666666667
8549184,5,B00AAJ1MR6,"Very interesting movie. Had a few neat plot twists that I did not expect. Not full of the usual Hollywood cliches. Yes, it's an independent film without well known leads and lower budget than the big films but still very entertaining nonetheless. And then add in an attractive lady in a suit of armor with a sword? Heck yeah!!",1362441600,,326,4.5423728813559325
8549185,4,B00AAJ1MR6,"Good story.  The film has the basic feel of the history with a lot inaccuracies on Historical aspects.  Example: There were no trains that ran from NYC to Arizona.  Transcontinental railroad didn't happen until 1867, three years after the Civil War.  The conductor would not have been with the train in that distance start to finish.  Several scenes used firearms not in existence during during the time period.  Some of the acting was ""cheesy"" but okay in a laughable way.

Acoustics were difficult at times but lighting was good and imagines were clear.  Animations realistic enough that you need to question if scenes were real or not.  The main character over emphasized her accent and role while the backup actors (mostly locals from the region) did a great job making the scenes seem natural.

Dangling and unresolved situation keep you wondering, ""what ever happened to...""  Over all a good movie that will keep you wondering!  Ending.......""CHEESY"" LOL  A star or two above ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Slayer!"" Enjoy.",1362009600,3,1022,5.047904191616767
8549186,5,B00AAJ1MR6,"Yes, I understand what this movie not from Hollywood, but I respect these people who did this. Really interesting story and all cowboys are real. Thank you again for your ART and Great style of Wild West.

8549187,4,B00AAJ1MR6,"If you are looking for a classical western, this film will surely disapoint you.
But if you like a mix of genre, then Shroud comes in. This is not a high budget hollywood movie, in the good way. It reduces itself to a rather intimate situation (I'm German - in my language I'd say ""Kammerspiel""-like) with a small but well chosen cast.
There are some nice twists in the story, some of them forseeable, most of them rather not.
So well, why no 5 stars? There are some scenes, where you realize, that some more budget would surely have helped to improve the movie. And I think, the makers could do better, still :).",1360281600,,613,4.385964912280702
8549188,1,B00AAJ1MR6,"I hate to be negative but this thing is so bad it's embarrassing to watch.  To be fair, I tried hard to watch it twice but have had an even harder time trying to re-sell it and finally just donated to a thrift shop.  This really looks like a high student project with some after effects thrown in. The script is disjointed, most of the scenes are dark and poorly shot.  To their credit, the actors do what they can with this boring, ridiculous material.  The poorly written synopsis should give you an idea as to how much this turkey sucks. Save your time, your 17 bucks & use the free prime shipping for something better!",1359331200,3,622,4.336206896551724
