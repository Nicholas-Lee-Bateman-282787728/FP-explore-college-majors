2710595,5,B000LMPMQ4,A must for anyone who ever watched Johnny's show. Had us laughing out loud. I'd forgotten about all the animals and unusual guests he had on his show. I always loved the Tea Time movie skits and of course the Great Carnac.,1189296000,20,222,4.309523809523809

2710603,3,B000LMPMQ4,"The production (sight and sound) of this DVD is good.  The comedy sketches are well-chosen.  The DVD is a little brief, only lasting an hour.  The same production of the 80s and 90s is probably more entertaining.",1286841600,,212,4.675675675675675
2710604,2,B000LMPMQ4,"Hi,  I really like Johnny Carson but these years must have been in his unfunny period.  I would reccommend them to you for historical reasons but they are not funny.  I am 72 and love the other JC video I ordered.  Not expensive but not funny.  Hope I am wrong and just having a bad funny bone day.",1264204800,,298,4.068965517241379
2710605,1,B000LMPMQ4,"As a present for several out of town friends, this DVD ruined my best laid plans by every single DVD being defective.  Amazon was amazingly unhelpful and though I am sure Johnny was wonderful-no one would ever know as none of DVDs played.  Disappointing to say the least.",1234742400,3,271,4.625
