4987959,5,B006GXLIVU,One of my favourite movies love the music just makes you feel great put it on when you need a lift in your feelings just a great movie its not about the story its the great music,1386115200,,178,3.8378378378378377
4987960,4,B006GXLIVU,"I like this movie. Two scenes I like the most are the Vienna woods in the mist of an early morning when Johann Strauss created ""Tales from the Vienna Woods""; the other when the song ""The Blue Danube"" echoed on the beautiful river.",1373068800,,230,4.372093023255814
4987961,4,B006GXLIVU,"The story is very good indeed, and the music is lovely. I love it. Only it is in ""black and white"".",1370390400,,99,3.761904761904762
4987962,4,B006GXLIVU,Worth seeing and hearing for the great musical sequences plus a mad scene by Louise Rainer using some stunning camera movement and editing.,1363046400,,139,5.086956521739131
4987963,5,B006GXLIVU,"My 86 yr old mother loves this movie.
Service was great,product arrived in a timely matter and was in great shape.",1338336000,,114,4.476190476190476
4987964,5,B006GXLIVU,"Must say really enjoyed this movie, so glad at last it's on dvd. Nice clear picture and sound as well, one very happy Aussie.",1333152000,,125,4.25
4987965,3,B006GXLIVU,"Finally on DVD (Warner Brothers Archive Collection!!) with Luise Rainer (now 102 years old, born in 1910 and still living in London!!!) and nightingale Miliza Korjus.

This is really a wonderful MGM musical based on Richard Strauss life - of course it has nothing to do with the real life which is typically for Hollywood and some of those events are never happened like the composing of the famous ""tale of the Vienna woods"".

But its wonderful filmed - the Cinemaphotography is amazing which inspired a scene for ""Dallas"" (when J.R. and Bobby are in Vienna in a episode).

The lyrics are composed by the famous Oscar Hammerstein.

Positiv:

+ wonderful DVD Cover Art-Work which based from the original movie poster

+ for a not restored movie the picture quality is good and better than other dvd release (russian, japanise) before!!!!

Negativ:

- DVD-R,
- not restored,
- no chapter menu
- no subtitles
- no bonus

FAZIT: I really would like to give this movie 5 Stars. But the movie is like a historical piece (Miliza Korjus voice and only one big movie! Luise Rainers acting! The photography! Art Direction! Music!) in the movie history who deserves a better release (means: RESTORED!!!) - Comm'on MGM/Warner Brothers!!!!",1329868800,5,1227,4.888888888888889
4987966,4,B006GXLIVU,"The Great Walz is a classic ""Hollywoodization"" bio-pic, one which hardly pretends to be accurate, but which uses the life story of an historical character as a basis for atmosphere and entertainment.  In this case the subject is ""The Walz King"" Johann Strauss II, who was responsible for the craze for the dance that conquered Vienna and much of Europe in the mid 19th century.  Made by veteran director Julien Duvivier, who made umpteen films during his long career, most of them forgotten today except for the classic Pepe le Moko, The Great Walz is endearingly filled with schmaltz and cliche, and features the absolutely incredible soprano vocals of Miliza Korjus (she was Oscar nominated for best supporting actress.).  All in all, an enjoyable light entertainment.  I saw this in the Turner Entertainment standard DVD which was of acceptable quality.",1485561600,,856,5.0928571428571425
4987967,5,B006GXLIVU,A good MGM film. The music is the true star. Not a Strauss bio but captured the spirit of Vienna. Had the old VHS tape. Glad to own the DVD version.,1483142400,,148,3.806451612903226

4987974,5,B006GXLIVU,"Waited a long time for this to come out on dvd; all I had was tape, no longer have tape machine. This was filmed before I was born. My Mom took me to a 'classics' movie' theater. Never forgot it.",1449360000,,195,3.9
4987975,4,B006GXLIVU,"This version of the Strauss family history was rather silly. It was probably meant to be just light entertainment--which it was.  However, I did enjoy it because the music was beautiful and the sets were beautiful with many gorgeous dresses.  But very little of it resembled the actual Strauss history.  For that you need to get 'The Strauss Family' on DVD or watch The Strauss Dynasty on You Tube.",1447113600,3,398,4.739130434782608

4987978,5,B006GXLIVU,"Wonderful, snappy production of the life and times of Johann Strauss, with all his best loved waltzes. Louise Rainer was as sweet as they come, living on to nearly 105 years of age, probably because her fans refused to let her go. This picture is a delightful treasure in my personal library of classic films.",1439856000,3,309,4.636363636363637
4987979,5,B006GXLIVU,Excellent copy - worked straight off !,1436313600,,38,4.571428571428571
4987980,5,B006GXLIVU,"There is a special magic about Strauss - a combination of his melodic genius, his lifelong love affair with the waltz, and the beautiful city in which he lived, composed and conducted. Viewing this movie, you can well appreciate why Vienna inspired another composer to write the inspirational song 'Vienna, City Of My Dreams'. All of Strauss's great creations in three quarter time are in the film, including of course the beautiful 'Blue Danube'. This film should be in the hands of anybody who is into Strauss - it doesn't matter how often you play it - it's just nice to know it's there. With classy performances by all the stars and a consistently appealing musical backdrop, 'The Great Waltz' will enhance any record collection - I am so pleased I have added it to mine.",1433980800,4,775,4.705882352941177
4987981,5,B006GXLIVU,Moving - there never has been a Cor. Soprano quite as good as Korjus - never!,1431216000,2,77,3.875

4987984,5,B006GXLIVU,"Got this for my 90 year old mom for Christmas.  She loved it, and enjoyed many fond memories of having seen in when it first came out.",1421884800,,134,3.962962962962963
4987985,1,B006GXLIVU,"I simply love Luise Rainer!  Her wide-eyed enthusiasm, child-like purity, total devotion, and beauty make her stand-out in every scene.  She is far too good for the amateurishness in every other aspect of this movie.  There are FAR too many comic relief characters - characters who have no purpose in terms of the story, but who do silly things to lighten the mood.  The extreme close-ups of characters is, even today, an annoying camera technique.  And, there was absolutely no need to create for the film an entirely different version of the real Strauss.  The REAL Strauss's life was interesting enough.  Writing new (English) lyrics for each Strauss tune - even those which never had lyrics before (or after) in the entire history of Strauss - was a bad idea.  Having a Strauss opera staged in Vienna with no particular story and taking music from several different Strauss operettas - why?  In terms of romance, it's hard to resist Rainer being abused by the man she blindly loves with all her being.  But, in ""Great Waltz"" we have another (worse) version of the ""Toy Wife"" story, but the man happens to be a composer.  The general idea in Rainer films is that if a woman is far too good for her man, she has to die.  She doesn't do so in ""Great Waltz"" and in a wild ""deus ex machina"" mechanism, we fast-forward at the end of the film to a time fifty years after her husband's astounding betrayals to when this formerly one-sided relationship has become (without any explanation) a mutually loving one.  This movie COULD have been a great one if its creators had bothered to show some respect for Strauss, not to mention an intelligent audience.",1421452800,2,1650,4.6678200692041525

4987991,5,B006GXLIVU,"What an obscure gem!  Why haven't I ever heard of this flick before?  If it wasn't for my mother, who is a big Strauss fan, I would have never seen it.  This movie has incredible energy, telling most of it's story through dancing, singing, and music, with only a minimal of talking.  All the performers were great, and I've never heard of either Ferdinand Gravet or Miliza Korjus before, but they were superb.  Luise Rainer started out demure, but came on strong when she had to fight for her husband.  And it was awesome to see Lionel Atwill in a non-sinister role for once.  Poor guy, he was always cast as heavies.  One of the best oldies I've ever seen.",1408406400,4,657,4.416666666666667
4987992,4,B006GXLIVU,"I like this movie very much only regret it didn't have subtitles. My husband watches it nearly everyday, because the music in the movie was so familiar, all the Strauss waltz with a beautiful song ""One day when we were young"".",1399852800,,226,4.536585365853658
4987993,5,B006GXLIVU,Excellent story of J.  Strauss and his  wonderful waltzes.  Being a musician really  helps to understand M. Strauss's frustrations in bringing the waltz to the people of Austria.,1399334400,,178,5.25
4987994,4,B006GXLIVU,This is a review of the Warner Archive DVD.  The images and sound are both great.  The sets are amazing and this DVD shows the detail lavished on these sets.  The costumes were also lavish and they show well on this DVD.  The black and white images are clean with fantastic gradation in black tones.  The source material used appears to be complete and well maintained.  If you want this movie this is the version to buy.,1395360000,7,421,4.402597402597403
4987995,5,B006GXLIVU,"The rapturous music of Johan Strauss and the glorious voice of Militza Korjus (in an Oscar nominated performance) combine with the Oscar winning Cinematography to make this one of the most glorious of Hollywood biographical films. Luise Rainer adds her support as the long-suffering wife.  One of MGM's most visually and aurally stunning productions.

An exquisite dvd transfer of a sharp, crystal clear print.",1393200000,3,410,5.390625

8497930,5,B006GXLIVU,I am very much found of Struss music. I always wanted to know about his adult life and this movie tells it beautifully. The package arrived on time. There were no scratches on the video. The quality was great. This movie is for the entire family. The seller had explained the movie nicely. I shall shop with them again and  higher recommend buying this movie for all ages.,1519516800,,372,4.470588235294118

8497938,5,B006GXLIVU,"Wonderful movie. I first saw The Great Waltz on the ship The Queen Mary in May 1939 when I was a 7 year Boy. My family and I were on the way to New York to escape Nazi Germany and the was the first movie I ever saw. I retained the memory of this movie.  The scene in the Vienna Woods showing Johann Strauss composing the waltz, Vienna Wood"" especially stayed in my memory.  I am now 85 and it was wonderful seeing this movie again.",1486166400,4,431,4.0
