4851689,5,B005OAEX18,"I got this to help others learn. For me I am learning a few things like tricks for the player. I started learning in 1963 and back then I found the Pointer System. Scott's teaching is like that. Scott takes it to a far quick and higher level. It is awesome teaching. You will need to stop and replay certain areas on the DVD why? Because it depends on your knowledge and skill level. Plus that is why there is a forward and reverse buttons on your DVD player. The teaching is awesome and you need to get the Easy Fake books. There are about 25 books each has 100 songs. Have fun, I have been playing for over 50 years.",1395014400,5,618,4.115702479338843
4851690,4,B005OAEX18,"this is a great program for anyone that wants to just have a basic and fast past learning on the piano. If your desire is to just enjoy playing the piano for your self and friends this is a great way to go. I have limited time but with just a limited time , have already become comfortable with a few songs and having the desire to keep going to learn more.
this is something i have had a desire to do for years but never wanted to go thru the drills of old school truing just to play songs for fun.",1390176000,7,499,3.9019607843137254
4851691,5,B005OAEX18,"I haven't played the piano for years & now Scott Houston is accomplishing something I thought would never happen ( his way is so easy).  I am so impressed!!!!!!!!!
I would highly recommend his program to anyone who wants to play the piano now
not in 6 months.

4851694,2,B005OAEX18,"These DVD's have two speeds.  One is super slow mo with endless banter - the other speed is super fast blur.  The upshot of this is that you can't really pick up and apply the more advanced techniques that he is teaching - this is especially true with the guest pianists.  The ""one on one"" discs help in this regard but I thinks it's essential to explain and show the techniques so all can follow when the are introduced.  I would also appreciate the content being broken up into learning modules so you can ""go at this"" in a coherent fashion.  It's ashame that the content is is so difficult to extract - because the content is good.",1356825600,34,634,4.338983050847458
4851695,2,B005OAEX18,"Don't get me wrong, I love Scott's ideas on how to play the piano and not take classical lessons.  Just know one thing though, on the box there is some FALSE ADVERTISING!!!  The bulk of the DVDs other than the two first ones which teach you the entire strategy in an older and more modern version, are all of guest pianists teaching you tricks, etc.  Those are great!  But they're not for me... yet.  They are for someone who can play a bit already.  So, while I'm sure they'll help me later - they do not now.

On the box, there is a little square box painted yellow which in red letters says:  Learn to Play now!  and it lists songs; some of which I didn't care to play, others which I'd love to learn to play and NONE OF WHICH WERE TAUGHT TO PLAY IN THE DVD SET!!!!

Songs listed:  don't know why, imagine, fly me to the moon, amazing grace, sweet home alabama, yesterday, as time goes by, moon river, bye bye blackbird, the christmas song, your song, you are my sunshine, it had to be you, scarborough fair, have a little faith in me, louie, louie, a thousand miles, new york, new york, the entertainer, mack the knife, the rose, nearer my god to thee, morning has broken, winter wonderland, joy to the world, christmas time is here, white christmas -- - and many more it says.

I'm sure it means, if you buy his fake books or other fake books, but they 'faked' me out when the box said I could learn those songs with this set.",1354665600,77,1431,4.239852398523985
4851696,5,B005OAEX18,"This is SO much fun!

Sixty-five years ago, I announced to my parents that I wanted to learn how to play ""cocktail piano."" What I got was 10 years of piano lessons, along with the mega-bazillion hours (in dreaded, daily, 90-minute doses) of scales, arpeggios, and pieces of classical music I had absolutely no desire to play. So, at age 14, I quit playing the piano, defeated and humiliated that I - a kid who naturally played piano ""by ear"" - had never become a proficient musical notation reader, let alone a good pianist.

Enter Scott Houston and ""Play Piano in a Flash."" Hey, this guy seems to know my story! Even better, he tells me that, in order to play the style of piano I've always wished I could play, I don't have to be either a master music reader or a dedicated piano practicer-of-music-I-don't-want-to-play! And after watching the first DVD in this series, I'm sitting at my keyboard, playing the great songs and tunes I love. No kidding.

Is anybody going to hire me, tomorrow, to play piano in their sophisticated cocktail lounge? Of course not, but that has never been my goal. I want to play the music I love, for my own enjoyment, and Scott Houston is already making that possible. Do I need to get better? Sure, but this set of DVDs is teaching me all those ""cheap tricks"" that Scott Houston tells me professional piano players use all the time. All I have to do is grab a simple lead sheet (Scott tells you what that is) of some piece that I'm dying to play, and start playing - adding those ""cheap tricks"" as I get ready to do that. Woo-Hoo!!! What if I can't remember exactly how to do something I saw on the video? ... I replay that segment, watch Scott Houston's hands on the keyboard, listen to what he tells me to do, then try it again. That's it. Minutes, not hours, just as Houston promises.

Best of all, this series tells me that my desire to play songs the way I hear them in my head - i.e., to play it by ear! - is exactly what is called for in this style of playing music. How great is THAT! I don't have to struggle to play the notes of some fancy arrangement. I can take the melody, with the simple chords that go with it, and then wing it, swing it, slow it down, jazz it up ... just the way you and I do when we're singing in the shower or whistling to ourselves. I can put in whatever ""cheap tricks"" I want, and make my rendition sound the way I like. My choice!

So, if your story is like mine, and you still yearn to play popular piano, without years of sweat and expensive piano lessons, buy this DVD set. The Piano Guy will show you how to get started on your adventure. Yes, you can! You may not think you can, maybe, but it's easy and fun. Go for it. C'mon!",1347753600,54,2703,4.2407766990291265
8481104,2,B005OAEX18,"Its not really very instructional, more of a look what we can do. Also it would not open on my computer DVD, so I had to use a DVD player to watch it. Also a disadvantage that there was no access to the lead sheets referenced so I was unable to follow along. The set I is pretty much of now use, as it is two DVDs where he goes on endlessly about his style of teaching, 2 is an updated version of one. I say, save your money. His youtube videos are more instructional, and are free.",1520208000,,482,3.9285714285714284

8481109,3,B005OAEX18,I learned to play the piano years ago.  I thought th would be a good way to get back to playing and learn to chord.  The system is either way to slow or way too quick in its instruction.  I am still fumbling through it though.  I am trying not to give up.,1488931200,7,255,3.7547169811320753

8481111,5,B005OAEX18,"I took the routine lessons and found I could not progress!  I then ran into this method which surrounds the melody line and learning the base chords and suddenly I am playing reasonably well which is better than what I was doing which was nothing at all!  Now, comes a warning you must be willing to me,prize major chords, minor chords and major 7th chords and be willing to practice utilizing them while playing a melody line.  If you are not willing to do that then do not waste your time or money.  I am far enough along now that I am playing and enjoying it, but I want more so I ordered ""The Next Step"" by Scott and it provides the information I need to advance to playing a song utilizing professional sounding left hand patterns and improvising with my right hand!  If you want to just enjoy playing which is what I am after these two offerings will get you there - if you are willing to commit to practice, practice, practice!  But this practice incorporates fairly good sounding music!",1452902400,6,994,4.434065934065934
8481112,1,B005OAEX18,"This is nothing new. You can find the same information on YouTube. However, when music is played only like this, there is no character to it. What is music but an expression of thoughts and feelings? When played this way, all that is gone.",1430179200,6,239,4.454545454545454
