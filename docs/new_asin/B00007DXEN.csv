7975297,5,B00007DXEN,"This is one of Daniel Bruhl's first movies -- and one of his best!  He was so thoroughly convincing in this, that I felt bad for him at times.  Like the other reviewer said, some more modern movies dabble in mental illness and dress it up with romance or mystery, but this felt like the real thing.  Very tragic and sweet, and it left you thinking about schizophrenia and just how alone those who suffer from it really are.  A bravo performance by him and a great directing job as well.  See this movie if you want to honest look at this dark subject matter.",1435536000,,558,4.276190476190476
7975298,5,B00007DXEN,"let me quote from imdb, this review by someone called ""superunknown"" says it all: """"Das weie Rauschen"" is probably the first movie that succeeded in giving its audience insight into the tortured mind of a schizophrenic person. ""A Beautiful Mind"" hammed up the subject by combining it with a love story and mystery elements. This movie, however, is real. So real, that it's hard to watch at times. Director Hans Weingartner makes great usage of Dogma-style camera and avoids all movie clichs. With only a small cast and a low budget this movie comes as close to reality as it gets. It helps us understand this terrible sickness and its victims - the sick person himself, as well as his relatives and friends - without palliating anything. The whole cast is fantastic. Daniel Brhl's performance is just breath taking. He's probably the best German actor at the moment and definitely headed for an international career. All in all, ""Das weie Rauschen"" is one of the best German movies I've seen so far. If you can get your hands on it, watch it!""",1232928000,5,1043,4.736263736263736
