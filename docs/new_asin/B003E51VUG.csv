8395284,5,B003E51VUG,"The animation is a little dated, but that did not prevent me from enjoying the wonderful story and the fun-loving characters in the show. Although only 12 episodes, the story arc does not disappoint and the ending is all I hoped for. I enjoyed the show so much, I have to give it a 9 out of 10. If I won the lottery, I'd fund the production of another season with improved animation : )  I can dream, right?",1437264000,,407,4.151898734177215

8395291,4,B003E51VUG,"Surprised for the US launch it went with Brighter Than the Dawning Blue but left out Crescent Love, which is the full name. I caught this series online a few years back then went out and looked for it but there was no release yet. Ended up buying some subbed thing from Cambodia unfortunately with sloppy subs. This series is unfortunately short. There are only around a dozen episodes but it is filled with great characters and a very nice story. Now there is light fan service but beyond skimpy outfits it doesn't go very far. Overall it focuses on telling the story more. I wouldn't call it the best series ever made, but Crescent Love certainly has some nice ""Disney"" scenes. Not overly violent or racy but a very idealistic romance story like you'd find at Disney. Just rather enjoyable. Try not to laugh at the animator's poor quality lettuce in the cooking episode. Hopefully this version includes the updated rework, but originally the lettuce was drawn as just a green ball on screen. Looked real stupid and people poked a lot of fun about it and it was edited in later release. But it still isn't super. Oh well, if that's the only flaw then so be it. Fun series that has been long overdue reaching the states. Hope others finally enjoy it too!",1275177600,13,1254,4.553097345132743
