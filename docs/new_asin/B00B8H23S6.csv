8564116,4,B00B8H23S6,About a guy who aspires to create a jousting league with scoring. He Brings in what appears to be guys with little experience to train them up for battle. He has one guy with experience who he sets up as the villain. The dram appears contrived/created. The sport appears dangerous. Surreal.,1489017600,,290,4.705882352941177

8564120,5,B00B8H23S6,"This six episode series, barring the ""reality tv"" spin on different issues and participants, was a joy to watch. It takes a true warrior and competitor to engage and succeed at heavy armor, full-contact jousting, and my hat is off to those who have mastered it. This series prompted me to attend my first event, and now, I travel the country taking pictures of the different competitors and their mighty war horses. I love my life, and I love what this sport has brought into it! I have so much respect for Charlie Andrews, and all he has endured to bring life to his life's passion. The DVD does not give him the exposure he deserves, and to meet him in person is to see the ""real"" Charlie Andrews - not the one created by NatGeo to get more viewers. In my opinion, they would have been better off using the angle that he's a giant of a man with a giant heart to match.
My only complaint, which falls on the manufacturer, is that they misspelled ""Knights"" on the first DVD. Rookie mistake for a professional company.",1377993600,3,1017,4.414893617021277
8564121,5,B00B8H23S6,I chose the rating because it lived up to all my expectations.  I just met Charlie Andrews and could not wait to see for myself why hi is so passionate about jousting and was not disappointed,1372118400,3,191,4.305555555555555
