7921905,4,B00004STET,If you like the other 2 movies I've named in the subject then you will like this one.  THere's a little bit of profanity and it's somewhat of a change from your average kung-fu movie.  Amazon doesn't seem to make Ninja Death II & III availbe (which you will need.. it's a 3-movies series).  I found a copy on ebay (in case your wondering where to get them).,1143504000,,357,4.220588235294118
7921906,3,B00004STET,"First and foremost, let me say that you need to get all three of the Ninja Death movies because there is basically no conclusion at all to the first one.  I knew there were three movies in the series, but I thought the second and third ones would be sequels and not continuations.  Thus, having watched Ninja Death without recourse to Ninja Death 2 and 3, I feel just a little bit silly.  The final scene of this movie just makes things more confusing than they already were.
Here's what I know.  Sometime around the early 1900s, a royal family from somewhere was chased down and killed by ninjas; one of the men carried a baby, and he supposedly escaped with the little royal heir.  The real action takes place a significant number of years later somewhere in Japanese-occupied China.  This fellow named Tiger works at a house of ill repute, helping to attract customers off the street.  Tiger's not a bad fighter, but his master puts him on a crash training course after he himself is attacked by ninjas - this mostly involves torturing the poor guy and beating the fool out of him every so often.  Meanwhile, the Japanese open their own brothel in town, and the main girl keeps trying to look at Tiger's chest - but he's having none of it because he is saving himself.  There's an evil ninja guy dressed in gold tin foil who apparently wants to kill somebody, and when his ninjas fail he brings out a guy in a devil mask.  This devil mask guy really, really hates flute music; it sets him off on a rampage whenever he hears it, and he has a tendency to appear from out of nowhere to try and kill people.  Obviously, there is some connection between Tiger and the royal family we saw in the opening scene of the film, but don't look at me to explain it because I don't have a clue.  The answers, I can only assume, are supposedly revealed in the next two Ninja Death films.
This movie does feature a lot of action, especially swordplay by the ninjas.  It gets ridiculous in places - watching men jump up into trees is bad enough, but among the crazier things you will see are a ninja suddenly cloning himself into three black-robed killers, guys appearing and disappearing in clouds of dust, and a lot of speeded-up film used to make the fighters seem faster than they are.  Things aren't all bad, though.  You'll see more blood here than in most martial arts films - unfortunately, it never comes from any stab wounds, but it does come pouring out of soon-to-be-corpses' mouths from time to time.
This isn't a chop suey film for the kiddies, I should note.  Naked women can be found here, sexual innuendoes come a dime a dozen, and the dubbed English audio contains a number of R-rated words.  The dialogue is actually pretty hilarious at times, and I have to wonder if even half of the stuff I heard was a part of the original dialogue in the film's native language.  With all of the comedy and action, Ninja Death really isn't a bad film, but I know from experience that there's not much point in watching this movie apart from the remaining two in the series - not unless you enjoy feeling utterly confused by movie plots.",1081123200,,3128,4.457894736842105
