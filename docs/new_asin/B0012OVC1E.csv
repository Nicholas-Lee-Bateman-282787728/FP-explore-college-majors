8247043,5,B0012OVC1E,"Here's a cartoon series I thought I would never ever see again.  So imagine my delight when I saw it available on DVD - and at a bargain price!  Dinky Dog was the little pup who grew and grew and grew!  He's so big that he's literally a walking, bounding disaster.  Just ask Uncle Dudley, who is forever referring to Dinky as a woolly mammoth, a brontosaurus or a moose.  However, he's so  lovable that he wins even his heart, and always saves the day.  This cartoon used to be on every Saturday morning but it's more than thirty years since the last time I saw it on TV.  It also had one of the most memorable, catchy themes of all time.  A must for every collector of quality classic cartoons.",1419984000,,695,4.244274809160306
8247044,5,B0012OVC1E,"This was part of the ""All-New Popeye Hour"" in its original broadcast run although Popeye, Olive, Bluto, and Wimpy have no relation in this segment (Popeye's face did appear on a tv screen in one episode for a short cameo).

Frank Nelson was hilarious as the voice of the harried Uncle Dudley, trying to retain his dignity and coming up with excuses to authority figures and irate neighbors whenever his large, awkward pet Dinky Dog would show  up and make a mess of things in a grand scale.  Voice expert-extraordinaire Frank Welker did the barking as Dinky.  Sensible Monica (Julie Bennett) and ditzy Sandy (Jackie Joseph) tried to help Uncle Dudley whenever Dinky makes the scene...but not too successfully.

Great Hanna-Barbera slapstick!",1390780800,,741,5.040983606557377
