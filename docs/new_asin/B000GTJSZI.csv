8134590,5,B000GTJSZI,"I just finished watching this DVD last night and knew the reviews needed one more to set the record straight. If I had read my review or one like it I would have bought this DVD without a moments hesistation. Nobody likes a slow boring fight, and although there are a couple that aren't great fights, the fact is they aren't boring, and the really great fights on this DVD far outweigh them beyond measure. let me tell you, I saw some fights I would never have believed were possible from fighters I thought I knew well. I don't like to blow the surprises so even though you might not rate my review highly  for lack of names and details I'll rish that and just say that there is no way I or almost any fighter can take as many knees to the head and stay in the fight and even turn around and burst into action a second after you thought he needed to be rushed to the Hospital and almost submitted the opponent.  If he had, it would have made him famous.  But, even though he went on to lose the fight (by decision) he gained a heck of a lot of respect from this reviewer!!  I never saw such a high energy action fight where someone who took sooooo much pain, from more than just a couple knees and strikes, and after all that, along with the dazed ''head dropped'' posture,  about to keel over, he suddenly turned around fighting as though he was on remote control. I only wish he had gotten the submission, it astounded even Bas Ruten, who was so amazed he couldn't believe his eyes, nor could I mine!  no exaggeration, this fight alone made a great DVD way better and worth buying to see it if it only had that one fight on it, just an awesome thing to witness!  I own about 100 fight DVDs and am glad I didn't miss this one. Its one I'd recommmend if you wanted to borrow just one or two of my DVDs.  ENJOY!!!",1211068800,,1813,4.174785100286533
