He's not hungry or scared, but has been well prepared for his starring role as Selik. The first feature ""Summer with Selik"" is fuzzy at times, it's not as well filmed as the sequel ""Selik & Katrine."" There is a scene in the first film of Selik making a ""mess"" on the floor, it's part of the story showing how much real labor was involved in taking care of an abandoned seal. In the sequel, Katrine finds another baby seal that she cannot rescue. This may be a hard lesson, but it's part of the natural world portrayed in the films; hopefully it won't upset young viewers. There is nothing graphic or scary, except when Selik falls off a wall and hurts himself (he recovers just fine). Thankfully, the filmmakers do not make the same horrible mistakes as in ""Ring of Bright Water,"" mentioned on the back of the DVD.

The Norwegian coastline is beautiful too. This film reminds me of the wonderful seal sanctuaries I've visited along Scotland's western coast, where sick or orphaned seals are lovingly cared for and released back into the wild. On the internet, you can locate these charitable sanctuaries for seals in Scotland and throughout the U.K., and even adopt a seal and donate. This is a beautiful film by a respected Norwegian wildlife filmmaker, and is in English.

8083207,5,B000B86MYY,"I saw this documentary when it was on PBS a few years ago and really enjoyed it.  The director has managed to show the seal's incredible cuteness without being too cutesy or patronizing, and the relationship between the girl and the seal is sweet and touching.  Additionally, the scenes of the coastline are lovely.  It is not so much about the cute antics of the seal, however, as it is about how this young girl and her father were able to teach a young orphaned seal how to be a seal so that it could ultimately be released back to the wild to survive on its own.  There is much information about seals which I found interesting, and I enjoyed seeing how other countries handle nature conservation issues.  Since I saw it a while ago, I can't remember many details, but I have been looking for it for a while and was glad to finally find it here.  (I'm sure I searched for it online before, but I must have spelled it wrong.)  I recommend it especially to animal lovers, but I think non-animal lovers would enjoy it, as well.  Hopefully, it will be shown on PBS again sometime, so more people will discover this delightful little documentary.",1062892800,,1145,4.471153846153846
