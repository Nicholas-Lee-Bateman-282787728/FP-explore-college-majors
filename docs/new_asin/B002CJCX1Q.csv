8364064,5,B002CJCX1Q,"I saw this movie when I was maybe 10... it scared the S*** out of me! I didn't sleep that night. Well, through research I figured out the name of that movie that scared the s*** out me sooo long ago... And it is Janky! Yes, janky! A typical 80s horror. I'm glad I got to laugh my ass off at something that scared me so much! DVD was just as described. I think that is what counts most.
P.S.
Got just as much of a kick out of the dual movie "" Mutant "" thank you!!!",1388188800,,463,3.783505154639175
