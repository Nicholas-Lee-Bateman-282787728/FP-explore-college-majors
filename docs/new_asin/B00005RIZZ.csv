1655626,5,B00005RIZZ,"Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z have always had so many of the elements needed for a great anime series: drama, suspense, action, comedy.  This tape is a good example.
Why recomend not buying a DBZ title despite it being so good?  The companies who make it don't know how to treat the fans.  I have been to a site that shows under upcoming releases what Funamation will publish the rest of this year from the DBZ series.  None of the titles include anything from the Cell Games.  Holding out on us fans, not publishing the last episodes of a saga before starting a new one seems to be a habit that is just getting worse.  Nothing is planned for this saga for the rest of the year.  What good is a story without the ending?  This is the best anime series I have seen, but the publishers are killing it for us fans leaving us hanging in the end.",1017792000,8,841,4.2125

7952439,5,B00005RIZZ,"Did you know that there are two different covers to Cell games-Surrender??
I am glad to see that the 4:3 or original version of DBZ is still sold.
Here the english voices are not re-dubbed ( they re-dubbed the voices of majin buu in the orange brick version which is cropped, etc), and the disc offers the original japanese cast.",1392940800,,329,4.5

7952441,5,B00005RIZZ,"If you want me to be honest, I really didn't care for the Cell saga overall.  However, that is not to say I didn't enjoy some parts, and this is definitely one of them, namely the much anticipated and long-awaited fight between Son Goku and Cell himself!  Last volume featured the warm-up, but now things get serious as Goku battles the deadly android that not only has all of his powers, but also his friends' and foes'!  But things really get insane when Cell decides to throw the rules of his own tournament out the window, forcing Goku to go to the extreme in an attempt to defeat him!  Can he win?  The DVD features some of the best fighting I've seen in the series, and best of all costs much less than the usual volumes, thus making it more affordable.  Another good volume, one that I definitely suggest adding to your collection!",1113868800,4,838,4.444444444444445
7952442,5,B00005RIZZ,"The long awaited rounds of the Cell Games, with the aid of time, finally find their home on DVD. This particular DVD contains the decisive battle between Goku and Cell. With the exception of the first (and poorly animated) episode, the disk ascends the series to levels never seen before, and in some cases never seen again. The fight moves at astounding rates, leaving you wishing it could last longer, but that's why we have Gohan. In addition, Funimation finally provides us with a reasonable price tag. If you slept on the Cell Games thus far, immerse yourself, because you won't regret it.",1089676800,,594,4.776699029126213
7952443,5,B00005RIZZ,"In my opion the cell games is by far the greatest saga in DBZ and this dvd is no exception. On this dvd u see goku fighting cell with everything he has got these are three exellent episodes of fighting and tension for all those who enjoy the fighting. i Rate this for any DBZ fan
The three episodes are:
Cells bag of tricks - Cells use his stolen abilites on goku will it work
No more Rules - Cell destroys the ring to continue his fight with goku till there is one man standing
The fight is over - Goku thinks the fight is over after blasting cell with a kamea kamea blast or is it",1089158400,4,582,3.982905982905983
7952444,5,B00005RIZZ,"Finally the main event in the Cell Games gets underway, Goku vs. Cell.
In the first episode: Cell's Bag of Tricks - Cell uses all of the Z fighters moves to try to stop Goku, but will it work?
The second episode: No more Rules - The ring gets destroyed by Cell, now the fight will end with only one left standing, Who will it be?
The Last episode on the DVD: The Fight is Over:  What looks to be a very nice victory is cut short and Goku is running out of energy, with this said a new Z fighter is about to enter the fight as Goku steps down, Who is it?
The rest of the Cell Games now will have plenty of fighting and finally it will all be avaiable on DVD, I recommend this DVD as well as the rest, you won't be disappointed.",1088640000,2,726,3.9054054054054053
7952445,5,B00005RIZZ,"In Dragon Ball Z- Cell Games: Surrender, the crucial action picks up as Goku spars against Cell in the Cell Games.  This video ended on a high note as *spoiler* Goku makes the shocking announcement that he wouldn't fight Cell anymore.  This video first hit the shelves in November 2001, and many of us have been as apprehensive as Goku's fellow Z Fighters about what would happen next.  Who else would be mighty enough to take on the godlike android?  Goku knew, and wasn't worried at all!
Well, as of today (December 10, 2002), DBZ fans can at long last get the answer to this question as Chapters 6 (Cell Games: Earth's Last Hope) and 7 (Cell Games: Awakening) of the Cell Games saga are released!  For those of you who remember fondly watching these episodes on Cartoon Network so long ago, here's your chance to see one of the most thrilling battles of the entire DBZ series once again!
And some more good news.  Chapters 8 (Cell Games: Sacrifice) and 9 (Cell Games: Nightmare's End) will be released on January 21, 2003); practically no time at all!  The climactic episodes of the Kid Buu saga (Kid Buu: Vegeta's Plea and Kid Buu: The Price of Victory) will be released earlier in the month (January 7).  The two most powerful villians of DBZ, going down in the same month!!  No doubt about it, the first month of 2003 will the best one ever for DBZ fans!",1039478400,5,1360,4.495934959349594
