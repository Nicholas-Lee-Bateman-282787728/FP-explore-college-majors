2792987,4,B000OA8OK4,"The original shipment came in the correctly labled case as you see here. When the case was opened it was a single movie case with only ""Starman"". Amazon quickly replaced it with the double feature as shown. The first one was obviously the fault of the company that labeled it. I commend Amazon for the quick and courteous replacement.",1376092800,,334,4.677966101694915
2792988,5,B000OA8OK4,Two entertaining movies for one low price and conveniently come together in the same package. Easy to carry and store this way too. Great deal.,1371340800,,143,4.76
2792989,5,B000OA8OK4,This movie although old is still an awsome account of what could happen if aliens did come to the earth. It's very tastefully done so that most kids could watch it without having nightmares which is a big plus. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a quick escape from the hum drum of daily living.,1368576000,,301,4.298245614035087
2792990,3,B000OA8OK4,"Both are dated flics; I like Starman - but for some reason, Close Encounters was pretty blase. Starman is more... timeless.",1362787200,,123,4.904761904761905
2792991,5,B000OA8OK4,ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES OF ALL TIME. STARMAN WAS OK. NOT AS GOOD AS CLOSE ENCOUNTERS. DREYFUSS DOES A TERRIFIC JOB OF ACTING AND THE STORY IS GREAT AND THE MESSAGE IS OUT OF THIS WORLD. I LOVED IT.,1360713600,,199,4.0
2792992,5,B000OA8OK4,"Nice packaging at a reasonable price of a great movie and a fun movie, ""Close Encounters"" is the great movie, of course.",1353715200,2,120,4.5

Just what I wanted.
You have excellent service and excellent products.

2793005,5,B000OA8OK4,"These are both great movies that stand the test of time, despite some clunky technology in the 40-year-old Close Encounters. Both these films deal with alien/human encounters are are benign rather than scary, as in Alien. I think Close Encounters is the stronger movie, but Starman, with its interstellar romance, is sweet and charming. If you haven't seen these -- or if it's been a long time since you have -- I recommend this bargain-priced set.",1503446400,,448,4.907894736842105

2793007,2,B000OA8OK4,Starman is not formatted correctly.  Part of the movie is lopped off and no aspect adjustment on my end fixes it. I had to adjust to make Close Encounters fit the screen right.  Third rate versions of first rate movies.,1499040000,2,219,4.45

2793011,5,B000OA8OK4,"This movie is still a classic after so many years.  A family man goes out to do a late night run in his truck.  He stops to peruse his map when another car comes up behind him.  He waves it around him then another ""car"" pulls up behind him and again, he waves it around him.  This time the lights raise above his truck and blind him with their powerful light.  He ends up with a half face tan.  After this encounter he goes home and anything he can use to create a sculpture that has the look of Devils Tower, he creates.  To a point that he creates a huge dirt, chicken wire, plants, and rocks in the entire living room.  His wife freaks out and leaves with the kids.  Then he sees a news story about closing down Devil Tower because of a toxic outbreak and recognizes it as his sculpture.  Meanwhile, a child also sees and hears the spaceship.  He crawls out the dog door which Mom forgot to close in her panic.  The little boy is laughing and gets picked up by the spaceship.  The mother tries to get him. It its too late.  She starts drawing Devils Tower but doesn't have it quite right.  That's all I'm going to say about it for now.  I don't want to ruin the story.
This came as a double feature with Starman.  It's about a creature from out of space that crashes his ship near ""Jennie's"" house and goes into it and with the help of several. Ally he brought, he becomes human from a baby to an adult in about 3 minutes using Jennies dead husband (Scott, I think).  He has no language except what he learned from a capsule sent into space.  ""On behalf of the United Nations...."" Jennie passes out.  When she wakes up she thinks it's just a dream but it's not.  She's freaked that Scott is there but it can't be Scott.  He forces her to take him to Winslow, Arizona to the crater. That's where the rescue craft will pick him up.  She starts as a kid napping victim. It later on she comes with him willingly to help him make it home.  And that's all I'm going to say about that movie.",1488412800,2,1987,4.15485564304462

2793055,5,B000OA8OK4,Starman- one of my favorite movies.  Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen are perfect in this and the only thing wrong is that there isn't a sequel or two.  I'd love to see what happens to those 5 or 6 extra balls left behind.......  I also enjoy Richard Dreyfuss and Teri Garr in any movie so also like Close Encounters.

I love the innocence of the film making here, no gratuitous violence, bloodshed or sex needed, just great stories, characters, writing, directing, acting and some suspense/good music.  I wish more films today had these elements, but since they do not, I rarely go to movies now, instead relying on old favorites to re-visit.

Close Encounters is a good Sci/FI.  Both these movies DOES NOT HAVE THINGS EATING PEOPLE. .  In both of these movies are the good guys.  Dreyfuss shows just how good an actor he is, he was a young man when this was filmed.

STAR MAN is also a very good Sci/FI , another innocent man from outer space.  How he forms himself into Debra Winger dead husband.  It has some funny moments and some very loving moments.  Very good movie.",1389225600,9,526,4.295918367346939
