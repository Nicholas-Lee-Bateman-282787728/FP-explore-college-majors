631911,2,6303366589,"This film is dull, and the comedy is pointless, but it is not the worst that was ever made.  This film has the famous sceen, where the house falls on Keaton.",958780800,,157,4.064516129032258
631912,5,6303366589,"STEAMBOAT BILL, JR. (1928):  Never having seen each other before, preppy college student Buster arrives to meet his father at his father's riverboat town along the Mississippi River.  Buster's burly father expects a tall  blue-collar guy he can pass his riverboat business on to inherit but is  disappointed to find a prancing Buster in pantaloons, ukulele, and a  ridiculous French beret which comes to irritate his father.  It's bad  enough that Buster is an incompetent wreck on the boat, the worst thing he  had done is get involved with the daughter of his father's enemy. Later,  Buster's father gets sent to jail for trying to slug his enemy and this  becomes an opportunity where Buster gets to prove himself.  The last third  of the movie contains some of the most classic scenes Keaton ever filmed,  which involve the destruction of the town in a cyclone. Scene after scene  shows Keaton bouncing around town trying to survive the desecration  swirling around him. I've never seen him more athletic.  This movie  contains the famous scene of Keaton going through the glassless-window of  the side of a 2-story house, which slams to the ground around him.  You can  see that the wall missed his left shoulder by about an inch.  The film did  not do well financially when it was released in 1928, but I think it was  due to a distribution problem.  As an independent filmmaker, Keaton did not  release all his films from one single company, such as a good one like MGM  which turned his films into hits.  I think Steamboat Bill, Jr. was released  by United Artists, which was a troubled company.  However, Steamboat Bill,  Jr. is a definite classic and deserved to be a hit.
One of the offhand  things I found amusing in this film is that there's an actual typo on one  of the title cards!  After seeing numerous silent films, I noticed that the  punctuation and grammar in them is always perfect, so I was surprised to  see a typo here!  The title card that says ""That must of happened when  the dough fell in the tool chest"" should read ""That must've  happened when the dough fell in the tool chest"".
CONVICT 13 (1920):  Another one of Keaton's early shorts, this one has the rambunctious quality  similar to the shorts he did with Arbuckle a few years earlier.  Buster  gets kicked out of his golfing clothes by an escaped convict and winds up  in that guy's stripes.  He ends up in prison where we are shown  quickly-paced gag after gag involving prisoners and guards.  The print on  this DVD is OK, but there are a few shots that appear mushy and unfocused.  Still, Convict 13 is well worth a watch numerous times.
DAYDREAMS (1922):  Daydreams shows Buster trying to win his gal by claiming through letters  that he's a successful career-guy-on-the-go, when actually he's the  opposite and most of the film shows him getting into trouble in the jobs  he's too embarrassed to admit he has.  There's a warning at the beginning  that a few scenes from the original print have been lost, but it doesn't  really matter, unless you've seen those scenes and know what you're  missing.  I noticed that a classic scene of Buster on the paddlewheel of a  boat was cut a little but it didn't bother me much.  Daydreams shows a lot  of filmed-on-location scenes, which I prefer over his studio soundstage  filmmaking.",951868800,9,3318,4.695804195804196
631913,5,6303366589,"I have most of the Buster Keaton DVDs and this is one of the most fun. ""Steamboat Bill Jr"" is the typical Buster Keaton plot, with twice the stuntwork. The hurricane scene is one of his most famous and shows the  talent, genius and dexterity of this man. Incredibly fun and entertaining  for the whole family.
The first short, ""Convict 13"" is not a  very high quality print, and some parts of it get very hard to decipher,  but you must remember that 1 complete reel of this film was considered lost  forever until recently. At least we get to see the short in it's entirety.  ""Convict 13"" was one of Keaton's first starring movies for Metro  studios and shows him in a very slapstick-ish role; His trademark dean-pan  expressionism and personality have not quite evolved at the time of this  film. It's still very fun, but not as sophisticated as his later  work.
The final short on this DVD ""Daydreams"", is another  'nearly lost' classic. The DVD states that some of the footage is  unavailable and they took the liberty to piece a few extra stills and title  cards to make the movie flow with a comprehensible storyline. Once again,  the transfer quality is not high, but better than ""Convict 13"".  ""Daydreams"" is classic Keaton, complete with the chase scene of  20-30 police officers, ala ""Cops"" (See 'The General' DVD). There  is an implied attempted suicide in ""Daydreams"", but it's all  completely off screen.
Once again, I have yet to be disappointed by a  Buster Keaton DVD from Kino International. I recommend it highly.",948585600,15,1531,4.709433962264151
631914,5,6303366589,"I must disagree with Leonard Maltin; Steamboat Bill Jr. is one of Keaton's best, and as a very fluid and well-plotted example of late-silent filmmaking, it makes an excellent intro to his work for neophytes-- better  perhaps than some of the more deliriously surreal comedies such as Sherlock  Jr.  Keaton's performance as the college boy son of a riverboat captain is  generally regarded as his best acting, and the 20-30-minute hurricane  sequence is one of his most remarkable feats of solo pantomime (it includes  the famous clip of a building front falling on him, the window landing  exactly where he stands).  This tape is also worth noting for the presence  on it of a recently discovered complete version of the short Convict 13,  one of the last missing bits of silent Keaton.",921542400,26,786,4.886363636363637

632021,4,6303366589,"but ""Steamboat Bill"" was interesting to watch. I haven't tried any of the ""extras"" except for the stills gallery and organ score (a little of that, I got the impression that it didn't really go along with the film either- yet it did seem to help maintain interest) and found that the condition of the film, never very bad, actually seems to improve as the story progresses.
Very impressive stunt work, no evidence of cushions for anyone to fall on, and an amazing shot or two of Keaton's acrobatic skill (continuous camera shots, no stopping or close ups to allow for trickery).
The story isn't too bad, don't skip through any of it, but I think all of the most famous scenes occur in the last 20 minutes of the film. Maybe the ""Stills Gallery""  has some detail on how the hurricane scenes were done (full size house sets blowing, rolling, around as if they were cardboard boxes) including that wall/window falling over Keaton without killing him but I don't remember seeing that much information.
Interesting movie to watch, even to own- but I don't think I'll collect a bunch of them.. I suspect I'd feel ""seen one, you've seen 'em all"".",1434672000,,1139,4.638613861386139

632065,5,6303366589,"Slapstick on a grand scale, Steamboat Bill, Jr. from 1928 was Buster Keaton's last film as an independent filmmaker, and the last of his great movies, featuring Buster's biggest and most audacious sets and stunts. The loss of independent status coincided with the advent of sound films, a change that meant disaster for Keaton and many other silent film stars. Knowing what was to come in the film industry makes viewing Steamboat Bill, Jr. a bittersweet experience.

William Canfield, Jr. (Keaton) graduates from an eastern university, and returns to the Mississippi River to meet his father, a riverboat captain whom he has not seen since infancy. Steamboat Bill is a towering man, who excitedly awaits the arrival of his grown son, whom he expects will be an even bigger man. Disappointment ensues when diminutive Buster Keaton arrives, complete with a mustache (a ""barnacle on his lip"", according to Big Bill), a ukulele, and ""sporty"" clothing from the 1920s including a beret. Buster struggles to prove he is a man his father can be proud of, and also a man the daughter of the wealthy rival steamboat owner can love.

The great opportunity to prove himself, and to stage one of the longest and most destructive slapstick sequences in film history, arrives in the form of a hurricane. Hospitalized after a confrontation with the Sheriff, Buster sees the entire hospital lifted and blown away as he lies in bed. He wanders the town as buildings disintegrate all around him, tries to walk against the hurricane wind, rides an uprooted tree through the air and into the river, and ultimately uses his father's steamboat, the ""Stonewall Jackson"" to rescue not only his father and his girl, but his girl's father as well.

The epic scenes of destruction were shot on the banks of the Sacramento River as a stand-in for the Mississippi. The buildings were carefully constructed to fall strategically to pieces, aided by a huge off-camera construction crane. On a couple occasions the cables pulling the buildings apart can be readily seen, and after the facades land in the street the cables can be seen trailing upward toward the crane.

Frantic, epic, funny, touching -- all are accurate descriptions of this movie. Buster Keaton's athleticism is so profound that he makes difficult and dangerous stunts appear routine. Watch him in a leaping descent down four levels of the steamboat's exterior, then an immediate climb back up the same four levels. Enjoy this, the last of the Keaton extravaganzas. His like shall not pass this way again.

Extras in this Kino edition of Steamboat Bill, Jr. include a complete alternate version of the film, photographed at the same time with a second camera, showing slightly different camera angles and a few alternate takes of various scenes. The video quality of this second version is not quite as good as the first version, likely due to being a print some generations distant from the original negative. A documentary on the making of the film shows some of the techniques used in the famous hurricane scene as well as numerous other details. ""Why They Call Him Buster"" is a short compilation of some of the pratfalls and assorted slapstick mayhem for which Keaton was famous. Two recordings of the popular song ""Steamboat Bill"" are offered, one complete with the printed music and words.

(The following is a paragraph of observations about Keaton that I append to all of my reviews of his films, so you might have read it before.) Charlie Chaplin was the graceful mime, Harold Lloyd was the surprisingly athletic everyman, and Buster Keaton was The Great Stone Face. His expression never varied, but his acrobat's body performed the most astounding knockabout comedy and genuinely dangerous stunts in cinema. Other stars had stunt doubles, but Keaton not only performed his own stunts, he sometimes did the stunts for other actors in his films as well. With the advent of sound Keaton's star faded, but has returned to full brilliance since his death, as restored versions of his films have become available for home video. One of Hollywood's true originals and a genius of motion picture inventiveness, Buster Keaton has secured a place of honor in the history of film, and in the hearts of his growing number of fans.",1400371200,,4264,4.94002789400279
632066,5,6303366589,I love watching a silent film every once in awhile to be reminded that you don't need words to tell a story.  I am also a sucker for slapstick comedy.  Buster Keaton's films deliver!,1383177600,,182,4.323529411764706

632068,5,6303366589,"This is a wonderful film. I had to watch the last half hour a second time-- those special effects are awesome, at least for the 1920s.

My favorite scene is the one where he ties the ropes to the upright beams in the steamboat. I like his expression after that! I don't know why comparisons to Charles Chaplin continue to be made-- as another reviewer noted, Jackie Chan is the better actor to compare with Buster Keaton.",1369526400,,421,4.467532467532467
632069,5,6303366589,"Keaton served as an uncredited co-director and writer in the feature Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928). This was Keaton's last independent production. He looks considerably aged, with a touch of pathos, yet still elegant, romantic, and athletic. The film is understandably most remembered for the startling, stirring imagery of its third act. It begins with a reunion of a father (Steamboat Bill--Ernest Torrence) and son (Steamboat Bill Jr.--Keaton).

Sr. is a seafaring captain of towering machismo, and not sure what to make of his citified dandy of a son. He takes Jr. to a barber and attempts to get him a new hat (Jr rejects a series of hats, including his famous pork pie). Torrence's portrayal of Sr. is an astute parody of blue-collar mores and traditions. In avoiding a maudlin relationship between father and son, Keaton's handling seems remarkably fresh and less dated. So too it is with Jr's romance with the daughter (Marion Byron) of his father's rival (Tom McGuire). While avoiding heart-on-sleeve propensities, Byron's character is underdeveloped, serving primarily as decor. Thus, Jr's intense attraction to her fails to register.

The fifteen-minute cyclone finale is an apex of silent cinema entertainment. The stunt work, cinematography (by Bert Haines and Dev Jennings) and set design are simply jaw dropping, regardless (or perhaps even because of) its age. Remarkably, much of the death-defying action is continuous and unbridled. Even more remarkably, Steamboat Bill Jr., like The General (1926), was a box office flop. Shortly afterwards, Keaton made a move to MGM and was coerced into relinquishing creative control of his films to a fascistic studio. His voice, already marred by drink, was unsuited to sound. Clearly an instinctual artist, Keaton was predictably unable to meet MGM'S mass commercial sensibilities, which accelerated his already rapid decline. Alcoholism, depression and institutionalization followed. Yet, courageously, Keaton rebounded, and it is his genius which has endured, while the studio stormtroopers faded into well-deserved oblivion.

632115,4,6303366589,"""Steamboat Bill Jr."" is definitely among the best of Buster Keaton's silent classics, undoubtedly up there with ""The General"" as a top-notch, major production with wonderful sight gags and a very charming story.  Some of the earlier reviews have gone into greater detail about the film.  It is clearly a highly entertaining film and, even for those who say they don't like silent films, is one of the better examples of how fun such films could be.

I love the rivalry/jealousy between the two fathers in the story.  Keaton and his girl are caught in the middle.  It's almost like a Romeo and Juliet story.  It's amazing the way everything is reconciled, through Keaton's heroics and ingenuity during the terrible wind storm.

The film was obviously a big budget production for its time.  Few comedies have been made on such a grand scale.  The expense versus box office revenues back in 1928 was undoubtedly a reason that Keaton's producer ""turned him loose.""  Keaton went to MGM, hoping for the best, and, unfortunately, after one more great silent classic, ""The Cameraman,"" he soon fell under control of The Factory that was run by Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg.  He was told what to do and soon paired with Jimmy Durante, who, although a friend of Keaton's, didn't work all that well with the stone-faced comedian.  The coming of talkies meant that Keaton had to talk more than an act and that didn't go very well for him.  His eventual decline is the ""stuff of legends,"" but, fortunately, his career eventually arrived and he lived to be acclaimed as a comic genius.  It's all told in Thames Television's wonderful documentary ""A Hard Act To Follow.""",1304121600,,1660,4.799295774647887
632116,4,6303366589,"First impressions count, and William Canfield is about to be disappointed. Beset by the empire-building intentions of a rival Mississippi paddle steamer boss, Canfield - known as Steamboat Bill - receives a telegram telling of the impending arrival of his son, Willie (Buster Keaton).

It will be the first time Canfield has seen his offspring since Willie was a baby. He expects a hulking brute, ""bigger'n me!"" - and that would be some size. He dreams of a physically robust, two-fisted ally to take some of the weight of his against-the-odds battle with JJ King.

What he gets though is a college fop, a ""shrimp"", with a ""barnacle"" of a moustache on his lip and a very un-robust beret on his head. More ham-fisted than two-fisted. For the classically crestfallen Canfield, there is much work to be done. First stop -  the barber, and the barnacle is gone. Second stop, the hat shop.

In a routine brilliantly, affectingly and subtly played by Ernest Torrance as Steamboat Bill and Keaton as Willie, a series of lids are placed on the youngster's head, all eliciting very different reactions from both father and son.

One porkpie hat - very much Keaton's trademark - is quickly removed by Willie before it can even be considered. The final choice, a wide-brimmed, high-crowned Panama-type number, is immediately swept away by a gust of wind outside the shop. The beret, recently discarded in Willie's pocket, is once again returned to his head, much to the consternation of poor Father.

The wind will play a greater part as Steamboat Bill, Jr. plays out its disaster movie finale - an orgy of destruction as a storm hits River Junction - that includes Keaton's most famous and frightening stunt; the facade of a house falling on top of him, his life preserved by the gap of a window frame fitting neatly over his shoulders.

Yet it is not Mother Nature that removes Willie's beret, just as Father Nurture failed to eradicate it.
Rather it's his beloved Kitty (Marion Byron) who helps kit him out in ""clothes for the boat"" - not the working duds crusty old Canfield expects but a naval officer's uniform that would be at home on a vessel far more imposing than the old Stonewall Jackson. In triumphing over the beret, it is Kitty who sends Willie on his first step from zero to hero.

Keaton's Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928) was the last of his self-controlled slapstick pictures, following the likes of Sherlock Jr and The General, made independently before he signed up with MGM and gave away much of his ideas-rich filmmaking autonomy.

The story goes that the Great Stone Face was suffering from a certain depression at the time of filming Steamboat, and Keaton himself later said of the house-falling stunt: ""I was mad at the time or I would never have done the thing.""

That kind of 'madness' may be lost in the mists of movie time, but first impressions count - and the world will always remember Keaton and the legacy of his silent masterworks.

632117,5,6303366589,"Buster Keaton's final independent comedy, STEAMBOAT BILL JR. (silent-1928) opens on Mother's Day with paddlewheel boat owner Bill Canfield (Ernest Torrence) receiving a telegram from his son.

Bill Jr. (Buster) last saw his dad when he was a small child, now he's college age. His telegram says in essence: when I arrive at the train station, you'll know me by the white carnation in my lapel. On this Mother's Day, ALL the gents are wearing white carnations so finding Junior won't be easy.

Thus begins the story of a brawny boat captain, his disappointment at having a puny offspring and the anger he feels that the boy is in love with a hated rival boatman's daughter (Marion Byron).  By its conclusion however, Bill Sr. does a one-eighty: he comes to admire a resourceful son who bravely rescues him, the girl and her dad (Tom McGuire) from certain drowning. He even openly welcomes Junior's sweety into the family and buries the hatchet with her old man.

Here, Keaton indulges his fondness for absurd sight gags:

An old-fashioned flotation device known as a life saver falls into the water and quickly sinks out of sight.
At a hat store, Bill Sr. makes Jr. try on a variety of chapeaus, none suitable. Buster's signature porkpie is placed on his head and he snatches it off lest Pops should see and like it.
Keaton lays a plank between two ships to walk across. While Buster pretends to be sleeping on his improvised walkway, one boat moves off leaving an end of the board impossibly suspended in air.
During a heavy rain, Buster sinks up to his waist in a street mudhole.
A wall topples onto Keaton and he passes harmlessly through an open doorway as it falls.",1293148800,3,1669,4.6825938566552905

This is absolute overkill, and I love every moment of it.

What we have here are two almost-alike, yet different version of the same film. Many of the takes are different from each other in both prints, and many of the camera angles are different when there was only one take of a difficult stunt.

Wow.

The bonus featurettes are nice too.

Now for the gripes -

This film has grain of a size that seems to perfectly not-match the resolution of hi-def. This serves to enhance the grainy aspect instead of reduce it. I'm not sure what the solution might be, other than some serious messing around with the sharpness of the transfer, which would cause other problems.

And, if we have two different print, it would have been nice to have a letter-boxed presentation of both films, side by side, complete. I'm sure I'm not the only person that wants this.

My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film 'Steamboat Bill, Jr.' only.

Along with Chaplin, Buster Keaton is one of the silent era comedians I've heard most of, yet until now I'd never seen any of his films.  James Agee, in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agee-on-Film/dp/0399508708/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agee on Film</a>, made such a strong case for him in a reprinted article concerning the silent era that I figured there had to be more to Keaton than the tepid synopses of his films that I'd read.  Perhaps it's unfair to expect anyone to capture the essence of Keaton's comedy in a few words or a single paragraph, but frankly, these short descriptions made the films sound tiresome and uninspiring.  'Steamboat Bill' is anything but.

To begin with, the actual events onscreen aren't the source of the comedy at all - it's in what Keaton does with them.  Where in a film description about a gnarled steamboat captain meeting his college-educated, dandified son for the first time is there room to explain that a father and son hat-buying scene is just one of the many priceless moments in the picture?  Or that two minutes watching Keaton trying to calm a baby, unaware that his gruff, grizzled father is looking on can be full of more character development than many movies cram into two hours?  While most summaries of the film rightfully focus on the tornado fueled finale, that scene of the film - while wildly entertaining - depends less on Keaton's ability to show nuance and more on technical feats.  Thus there are elements of it that have been copied and adapted for other comedians over the years.  What really sets the film apart is Keaton's ability to transmit complex emotions with subtle gestures and deadpan delivery that is impossible to imitate.  Other actors *might* be able to replicate some of his broader sight gags - but I doubt anyone could portray the disheartening, deflating range of feeling simply in getting his mustache removed at a barber shop.  In other words, there is no substitute for Keaton himself.

I don't think I can recommend this film highly enough to those who enjoy physical comedy.  I don't think I can recommend it enough for people who think they *don't* like physical comedy - if, after watching 'Steamboat Bill', they still don't, then I doubt anything will change their mind.  But even beyond the physical elements, viewers who assume older films will appear unoriginal and plain compared to the enhancements and embellishments added over the years to the medium in general may find themselves surprised at how unique and fresh Buster Keaton remains.  Watching Keaton now, it strikes me that the addition of sound to motion pictures created an entirely alternate art form, one whose very palatte changed the nature of comedy.  In that case, it's easy to think of 'Steamboat Bill, jr.' as one of the last works of the old masters.

This VHS copy probably matches up well with the streaming rental I watched, but there is a new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/blu-ray-edition/dp/B003H221MS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">blu-ray edition</a>&nbsp;that I'm saving my pennies for.  As an introduction, I can appreciate this version, but it's only whetted my appetite for more.",1291075200,,3536,5.201058201058201
632120,5,6303366589,"When we think about Buster Keaton, we think of one of the kings of slapstick comedy during the silent era.  The master of physical comedy, a talent known for his deadpan expression and his films, well-revered today as one of the best actors and directors of all time and beloved by many.

But in 1928, Buster Keaton was going through one of the most problematic times of his life.  A marriage to Natalie Talmadge (of the popular Talmadge family and sister to actresses Norma and Constance) which was going south and to make things worse but two years prior, Keaton had learned that Joseph M. Schenk (the man in which Keaton was contracted to) would be taking the job as President of the new United Artists (created by D.W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks).

And with Keaton now losing independence as a director/actor and becoming part of the new studio mentality, in the three year period, he would create three films which would be his final films he would have complete control over and that was ""The General"" (1926), ""College"" (1927) and his final film with United Artists, ""Steamboat Bill, Jr"" (1928).

Like ""The General"", ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" is considered one of the best films that Keaton had created but in 1928, people didn't feel the same way.  People were now getting read for the talkies (which was in its infancy) and slapstick comedy was phasing out and people were wanting something new and different.

Eventually like many silent era stars, ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" is considered as Keaton's last great silent film and is now considered today as not just one of the top Keaton comedy films ever created but one of the top comedy silents of all time.

VIDEO:

""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" is quite literally the best looking version of the film available and for an 82-year-old film, Kino International has once again done a spectacular job on a silent film release on Blu-ray.

Before I discuss the picture quality of ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."", it's important to note that because this is a silent film, it's important to emphasize that each silent film has been handled and stored differently.  With that being said, I also want to add that there are only so many very good silent films still around, many destroyed from fires started by the Nitrate film or mishandling (or improper storage).  Fortunately, a good number of Keaton films have strong film elements that have led to Kino International wanting to release more Keaton films on Blu-ray and to also make sure the film has not been digitally tampered.

Similar to ""The General"", Kino International has done a a great job with bringing this film to Blu-ray.  Presented in 1080p High Definition, black and white, yes, the film is not pristine (no silent film in HD will be) looking as it does have scratches, dust, hair and other damage that the film has gone through within the last 80-years.  But this is to be expected, if anything, many silent films on nitrate were not well taken care of, so each time I see a film in which the films are much better than I expect, I'm quite pleased and for ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" in HD, it's definitely a major improvement over its original DVD counterpart.

I have watched many silent films that have had considerable nitrate damage but this film still looks fantastic for its age and you will not see the nitrate damage or acid buildup in the film's sides.  Yes, it's not pristine but it's the best looking version of the film that I have seen so far. There is a good amount of detail where you can actually see detail on the ground, on the wood of the Steamboat bill ship, the curvatures and bark on a tree.  It's important to note that some elements of the film do show its change in black levels but by no means was this distracting for me.  I know of one review that said that contrast was blinding and I think that comment was a bit excessive.  There are changing levels but by no means was it blinding or over-contrast.  I found the black levels and contrast more distracting on the DVD but I believe that KINO did a wonderful job in fixing it on the Blu-ray release (and I am assuming it was fixed also on the  ultimate collection 2-disc DVD that was released simultaneously on the same day as the Blu-ray).

The differences between the Buster Keaton Estate version and the Killiam Shows Archives version is quite interesting as the films show different takes.  Because the film were handled by different properties, the picture quality is slightly softer in the Killiam version but personally, both looks good and I'm very grateful that both films are included in this release.

Many have wondered if the film does have any DNR and Bret Wood posted on Nitrateville.com:

When we transferred THE GENERAL, we had the grain-reducer turned down to zero, assuming that would kill it. But when we QC'ed the Blu-Ray, we saw traces of digital artifacts. As a result, we re-transferred THE GENERAL for Blu-Ray, with the grain-reducer not just turned to zero, but completely by-passed (and we followed the same technique for STEAMBOAT BILL JR.).

By this time, the DVD of THE GENERAL had already been released, so it has a slight amount of digital noise reduction, but it's virtually undetectable on a SD monitor.

But despite its having its share of dust and particles and other things that do show up in the video, comparing both this Blu-ray version to the DVD version in my Kino ""Art of Buster Keaton"" set, ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" looks fantastic on Blu-ray!

On the DVD, there is constant flickering and there were times that blacks look quite deep and were hard to see faces at times.  Also, seeing how much cleaner the print looks on Blu-ray vs. the original KINO DVD is quite amazing.

Iknow some Blu-ray purists that have never seen a silent film can be alarmed that silent films are not clear and pristine but the fact is many of them aren't but if we can get something as close to perfect, for an 82-year-old film, I'm quite impressed with the results!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

With any release of silent films on Blu-ray, one thing that I have always wanted to see is more musical scores that people can select for their own viewing and personal preference.

For ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."", you get the The Biography Players music presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, an organ score by Lee Erwin and a piano score by William Perry.  Unfortunately, the music by Gaylord Carter presented on the original DVD is not included.

It's important to note that the Buster Keaton Estate version comes with The Biography Players DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 score and a Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo version and the Lee Erwin mono organ score.  The Killiam Shows Archive version only features the William Perry Dolby Digital 2.0 piano score.

The Biography Players lossless score was well-done!  I enjoyed Gaylord Carter's score from the original, so to hear another score, I was quite impressed of how the orchestra carried on various instruments during a scene's most emotional or hair-raising moments.  It is important to note that the score is presented on all five audio channels.  But just in case, you don't like that, you can always select a Dolby Digital 2.0 version of the score.

I also enjoyed the organ score by Lee Irwin (presented in Dolby Digital mono) and you get the Dolby Digital 2.0 piano score by William Perry.

There are no subtitles in this Blu-ray release.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" comes with the following special features:

  * Steamboat Bill, Jr. (Killiam)- (1:10:29) The second version of the film which is similar to the Buster Keaton Estate version but the Killiam Shows Archive version does feature different cuts of scenes (such as the trying on a hat scene).  The Killiam Shows Archive version only features the William Perry Dolby Digital 2.0 piano score.
  * Visual Essay - (12:20) - A short documentary explaining Keaton's mindset during the filming of ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" and the challenges that Keaton faced at this time in his life.

EXTRAS:

""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" comes with a slipcase.

JUDGMENT CALL:

As a big fan of Buster Keaton films, from his silents to his talkies, I do feel that Kino International has done a fantastic job with this Blu-ray release of ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."".

While I really enjoyed ""The General"", ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" is a film that I enjoyed even more.  I felt the physical comedy by Buster Keaton was fantastic!  The scenes when the hurricane hits the town literally  makes your jaw drop and makes you wonder how they created those scenes in 1928.  Hurricane-like winds, watching Keaton risk his life and putting his life into this crew's hands as homes and buildings collapse all around him, houses falling on him and literally escaping harms way to seeing him on a tree and being carried away by the hurricane (of course, a crane whisking him away from land to ocean).  The fact is for this film, Keaton put his life in jeopardy and just the slightest miscalculation could have either killed him or maimed him.  Fortunately, Buster and his crew prepared quite well for those scenes.

Keaton including his third wife have said in past interviews that he didn't care about doing those scenes because at the time, he was fighting off depression.  His marriage had failed (which would actually hurt him severely a few years later), his financial problems were mounting and the lifestyle that his wife had wanted was taking its toll (it's important to note that in their bitter divorce, Natalie Talmadge literally took all his money and his children away from him and leaving him a broken man driven to alcoholism).

As much as I love the film, I can't help but feel saddened that this incredible film was a box office failure and literally stripping away Buster Keaton's control over his films.  But the fact is that Keaton was one of the casualties of the crossover from silent films to the talkies.  Without Joseph Schenk, without the support of his wife, without control over his films.  But he took the advice to close down his own studio from Schenk and to move to Columbia Pictures.  This slapstick comedy king had his whole role reduced when he went to MGM (which Buster would say was the worst decision he made all his life) but the truth was, whether he kept his studio or not, the movies would never be the same for these silent film stars.  And while Keaton would go on to make commercially successful films, the days of Keaton showcasing his physical comedy (which the studio would not allow and he had to work with a stunt double) was over.

So, in many ways, ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" can be seen by many of us today, as his final silent film in which we got to see the actor at his most daring.  Exciting, captivating, and doing things that not even Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd would ever dare do.  But the attitudes towards cinema during those final silent years were not kind to these silent stars and for many people watching this film, its difficult to imagine how this film did terribly because it's a fantastic film that you can't help but respect Keaton for what he accomplished.

As for this Blu-ray release, once again, Kino has done silent film fans a big service.  Another wonderful Keaton film in HD and their continuing dedication of bringing silent films to the masses, especially to those who are now discovering silent films for the very first time.  The fact that you get both the Buster Keaton Estate version and the Killiam Shows Archive version is a major plus (same film but both have different takes and alternate scenes).  Also, I was quite pleased with the features presented in this release.

I will say that if you are planning to buy this release, you're going to read different reviews about ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" on Blu-ray and you are going to see reviews that are positive and negative due to the way the video is presented.  I am on the side that feels the presentation of ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" was well-done and I know there will be those who will debate the black-levels and the contrast and so forth.  In my case, the contrast was not blinding but again, we all have different equipment.

But for the film alone, what was included on this Blu-ray release and its' over all presentation, ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" is a winner and is highly recommended!",1287619200,12,12723,4.717194570135747
632141,5,6303366589,"Having been a fan of Buster Keaton for almost 40 years, anytime a truly beautiful print of one of his films becomes available is a time to rejoice.  Here, we have two different prints of the same film, and both are worth watching.  The story about a young man who comes to live with his father-who treats him with disdain because he is not a chip off the old block turns into quite a comedy epic, with some of the most spectacular stunts of Keaton's career (the scene where the wall of a house falls around him is still stunning, especially when you take into account the 2 inches of clearance around him-if it would have wobbled...).

Kino, as usual, has put together a package that rivals their previous one for THE GENERAL, with various music tracks for the film (although I wish they would have included Gaylord Carter's organ score which was on their previous DVD release and is his most majestic score) and extras, including behind-the-scenes photos and recordings of the song ""Steamboat Bill"" from the early days of recording.

Supposedly a Blu-Ray disc of OUR HOSPITALITY & SHERLOCK, JR. is in the works, and of course we have Kino's new restoration of METROPOLIS to look forward to at the end of the year or the beginning of next, so a tip of the captain's hat to the incredible people and the work they do at that company-keep it coming!",1282262400,6,1347,4.553719008264463

As always, Keaton's antics and sight gags are a hoot, such as when he tries, feebly, to bust his dad out of jail for socking McGuire, the ferryboat proprietor who's edging into his business. His expressive facial gestures here rival Chaplin's for sheer sad-clown poignancy. The film's set piece, which involves a raging tornado and an uprooted tree, culminates in one of the comedian's most daring stunts--all of which he performed himself. Steamboat Bill Jr. is a gas, powered by a master of physical comedy.",1182297600,,655,5.130841121495327

Steamboat Bill, Jr. features some of the most well known stunts of Keaton's career including the scene where the house falls down on him and he's in the window looking around. The storm scene is one of the best parts of the film. It features many impressive stunts and lots of action as well as comedy. However, Keaton does not only excell in outrageous scenes. The bit in the jailhouse is subtley hilarious.",1174348800,,793,4.624113475177305
632145,4,6303366589,"These three samples of Buster Keaton' work span most of his silent solo career (1921-28) and show the infinite diversity of mood and theme he was able to create. The short films are particularly interesting in being rarely seen and only recently preserved and reconstructed; one of them, Daydreams, is still fragmented but with enough of the film rescued to be worthwhile. Both of the shorts show significant signs of decomposition and many scenes have very poor quality. Of course, none of that matters to Keaton fans, who will be happy to see his movies in any state but lost.

Convict 13, the earliest of the 3 films in this set, was the third short since his departure from his mentor Fatty Arbuckle. It reveals some remnants of the Arbuckle-Keystone influences, including wild scenes of mob chaos , as when Buster wields a heavy leg shackle to subdue a prison riot. But the formula of the film is pure Keaton, as his character undergoes a series of mishaps, first as a golfer, then as a prisoner, before displaying superhuman skill at singlehandedly thwarting a prison riot and winning the girl.

Daydreams, one of his last shorts from late 1922, has a formula that is rich enough in comic possibilities that one could almost imagine it as a feature film. In fact, it suggests the formula of ""The Three Ages"", insofar as the story is told in disjointed fragments with different settings. It also has the characteristic hints of darkness, as Keaton's character resolves to prove himself a worthy suitor by becoming a success at a chosen occupation; if he fails, he promises to ""shoot himself"", whereupon the father of the girl (played by Joe Keaton) gleefully offers to supply the gun. Of course Buster fails at everything he tries, but fortunately for him, he also fails at shooting himself by missing! The film has the famous shot of Buster being trapped on a moving paddlewheel of a boat, a scene which is as iconic to Keaton's character as the Clock in Safety Last is to Harold Lloyd's.

The feature, Steamboat Bill Junior, fits into essentially the same formula as Convict 13: again, an underdog with virtually no respect shown to him by man or nature eventually performs an almost superhuman act to redeem himself to the world and win the girl. The setting here is a river town, Buster is the weak, clueless son of a tough steamboat captain who tries and eventually succeeds in helping his father defeat the rival corporate entity. First however he must undergo significant abuse as he tries to adjust from spoiled big city life to the rugged life on the river. The climax of the film is a cataclysmic storm that floods everything, and Buster saves his girl, his father and his girl's father from drowning. Buster's acrobatics are as always amazing to watch; this time, he maneuvers around a large steamship with the dexterity of a monkey but also with the grace and beauty of a ballet dancer.

Steamboat Bill Jr. is not as successful and universally satisfying to watch as The General or Sherlock Jr., but there are enough wonderful moments to make it worthwhile. Of all the KINO volumes in this collection, this may not be the best, but its quality makes it worth owning.",1158105600,,3183,4.740072202166065
632146,4,6303366589,"This was a surprising and remarkably paced film of Keaton's. What starts out as pretty quaint and rural extends to higher and higher proportions as the comedy switches from the difficulties of two lovers trying to get together despite a family feud to Keaton running around town during a tornado. All of it is filled with those Keaton conceits one comes to love, but it's the most physical of his full-length features, where even in quiet parts he will do pratfalls of stunning dexterity that can leave you no less than awestruck.

The beginning, however, is a lot more a set-up of sight-gags, most of which are very funny and surprisingly inside-jokey. At this point, it seems Keaton expects the audience to know him, which leads to some pretty original takes on his own character. Another earlier site-gag involving a mix-up in the father and son trying to reconnect and accidentally coming across various and unamused strangers is a little politically incorrect for our time, but is still very funny anyway.

632147,4,6303366589,"STEAMBOAT BILL, JR (1928) was Buster Keaton's final independent film -- the last feature he would make before financial issues forced him to sign what would be a disastrous contract with MGM.  Therefore, it seems fitting that this film contains a quick throwaway laugh where, upon being handed a familiar looking porkpie hat (a mainstay throughout his career), he throws the headwear away in horror.  This movie has a lot going for it.  While it takes a little time to get started, it finishes strong with a finale that shows exactly how hilarious Keaton could be when given the creative control he craved.
Steamboat Bill is a rough, working man, trying to keep his head above water in the steamboat ferry business despite his extremely wealthy competitor.  He welcomes the forthcoming return of his son, who he hasn't seen since the boy's childhood.  But when short, pampered Buster Keaton (the Junior of the title) arrives, Bill Sr.'s hopes of having a strong, vigorous young man to help his trade are dashed.  But to make matters worse, Keaton is madly in love with the fetching young daughter of his rival, and the two lovers continue to see one another, despite the objections of their respective families.  Yes, it's ""Romeo and Juliet"", had Shakespeare been less interested in suicide and more friendly with steamboats and slapstick.
Three years earlier, Keaton had done a film called SEVEN CHANCES (1925), a movie I felt wasn't really memorable until the long and hilarious chase sequence that begins towards the end of the film.  And like SEVEN CHANCES, this film really takes off in its wild grand finale.  Not that the film is bad beforehand.  It isn't.  There are numerous strong sequences.  But I love Keaton when his pace really starts to pick up and he madly runs from one crazy sight gag to another.  And once the rain starts falling and the hurricane turns up the intensity, the film presents us with some of the most successful material of his career, as well as the most famous.  Everyone has seen the scene where the exterior wall tips over and Keaton only survives by standing where the empty window falls -- that's from this film.  The pace resembles one of his more frantic short films, and the timing is, of course, superb.
The disc also contains two short films from earlier in Keaton's career.  CONVICT 13 (1920) involves a case of mistaken identity.  A golfing Keaton is accidentally put in jail, confused with a prisoner who is due to be executed that very day.  This short is devilishly funny.  The sequence of Keaton being hanged by an elastic rope has to be one of the funniest few seconds ever committed to celluloid.  And, of course, it's always entertaining to see Joe Roberts in another amusingly over-the-top fight sequence where he gets to throw extras (and Keaton) around like ragdolls.  This ranks as one of Keaton's strongest short films.
The other short film included is DAYDREAMS (1922).  Actually, it would be more accurate to say that this is merely a reconstruction of the film itself, as a complete copy did not exist at the time of this release.  That said, the fact that some minutes of footage are missing doesn't hurt the film at all (although I did dislike the apparent decision to slow down the occasionally piece of footage; it really hurt some of the gags).  On the contrary, this is a fabulous twenty-two minutes, and while some of the gags are a bit predictable (he writes to his girlfriend that he's really ""cleaning up"" Wall Street; she imagines he's become a power player, but I think anyone reading this can guess what he's really doing), they are strikingly funny in execution.  Some of the jokes are quite inventive and surprising.  Keaton shoveling dirt into a trash can with no bottom is amusing (and a quiet recycling of an earlier joke), but it's hilarious when he shifts position to reveal that the receptacle was sitting on top of an open manhole cover with an angry sewer worker underneath.
This disc contains material from opposite ends of the 1920s, showcasing Keaton as an independent filmmaker creating both short and feature films.  It's a great look from a cinema history point of view, but it's equally effective at showing us some damn good filmmaking.  STEAMBOAT BILL, JR was the end of an era, but Keaton's independent career sure went out with style.",1084320000,,4329,4.782258064516129

One year before the Wall St. Crash, the film pits Fitzgerald-like dreamers Mary the flapper and William the aesthete in the true culture of the 1920s, a corrupt monopoly town, where the law is in the pay of the town magnate, and whose foundations are perilously flimsy.  It is also the last great American film of the silent era, and, as if to prove it, casually shows off all the things it could do, culminating in a staggering storm climax, part-surreal deus ex machina, part-wild Id.  Finally, it is the last film over which Keaton had significant control: quick decline would follow.  As well as boasting all his cherishable visual qualities, it features his rare intelligence too, his heroism undermined by dream and theatrical metaphors; the expected marriage crowned by a lifeboat hoop that had previously sunk.",987724800,6,908,4.953947368421052
632150,5,6303366589,"As one of his last great silent films, Steamboat Bill Jr.(1928) is one of Buster Keaton's finest. Nearly a third of it's 69 minute running time is comprised of some of the most spectacular and funniest stunt work Keaton ever did.  The General, Our Hospitality and the 45 minute Sherlock Jr. are better films but none are any more entertaining than Steamboat Bill Jr .
Bill (Ernest Torrence) is the tough Captain and owner of the old and somewhat run-down Stonewall Jackson river boat. He is about to be run out of business by the richest man in town, King (Tom McGuire). King has built a huge, fancy river-boat and gets the Stonewall condemned.
Bill then gets word that his son is going to visit him.  He has not seen his son for many years-Bill Junior aka Willie, has been in college back east-and Bill Sr. imagines his son must be bigger than he is.  He's pretty disappointed that not only does his son look like a 90 pound weakling, but he's got a city slicker hat on that has got to be replaced pronto. Father decides its time to make a man out of his son, while son Willie, has his eyes on a beautiful young lady (Marion Byron) who happens to be chief rival King's daughter.
Father Bill ends up in jail, and Buster Willie tries to break him out.  He succeeds, but is almost accosted himself so Father turns himself back in and Willie is sent to the hospital with a minor injury. Just when it looks like the old Steamboat is doomed for extinction, and Willie won't get the girl the weather changes.
The final extended sequence of the film begins at the front porch of the King Hotel.  King is warned that a wind storm is coming and the  pier is not going to be strong enough to hold his fancy boat against the wind.
The wind blows and the death defying stunts, and inventive sight gags begin.  A man tries to start his car, the wind blows the hood of the car up which makes the car into a land sail boat-with the man being dragged down the street holding onto his cars bumper.  The car comes to a halt in front of the King Hotel.  The Pier collapses and the King Steamboat breaks away and some of its crew leap for their lives.  The entire front of the King Hotel collapses into splinters and is blown away.  People on the street struggle as they run for cover and shelter.
Buster Willie who is in the hospital, remains in his bed as the patients and nurses flee out the hospital which is then entirely blown away.  Buster tries to leave the area with remarkable calm but must leap onto his bed as it is propelled through the ruins of the town's streets and through a horse stable.  In the middle of the street, Buster goes under the bed for cover.  A man leaps from the second story of his house onto the bed.  The Bed collapses on Buster.  The wind blows the escaping man and the bed away.
Then the somewhat confused Willie rises to his feet, in front of the house that will be ripped apart by the winds and give us one of the most infamous and death defying stunts in all of movie history.  As he stands groggy and confused, the entire two ton facade of the house falls and crashes over him.  A small window opening just happens to have passed over the very spot he is standing.  Buster had positioned himself with only inches to spare so that the facade would crash over him but avoid crushing him to death.  If he had missed his mark by a few inches, or if something had gone wrong, Buster Keaton would have been crushed to death.
Realizing how close he has come to death, Willie tries to run, but the wind is too strong and soon he is sliding and tumbling and being blown as if he is a tumbleweed down the street.  Eventually he winds up amongst stage props at what remains of the theater.  More inventive gags follow leading to an exciting finale in which he must rescue his father from drowning in the Jail,the woman he loves, and more.
Keaton did all of his own stunts.  He designed many of them to be shot in longshots, choreographing movements so he tumbled or was dragged from end of the frame to the other.  His acrobatic ability continues to amaze.  It should come as no surprise that one of Keaton's biggest fans is Jackie Chan, who carries on old stone-face `s tradition quite well.
The credits list Charles F. Reisner as the director of Steamboat Bill Jr., but it is unlikely Reisner even co-directed the feature with Keaton (Keaton did collaborate with Eddie Cline on several shorts).  Keaton actually directed all of his feature films, sharing or giving away credit to a string of studio assigned directors who did very little work on Keaton's films.
Also featured on the wonderful KINO DVD (and video) are two wonderful Keaton shorts.  Convict 13 and Daydreams.  Convict 13 (1920) contains some clever physical slapstick choreography while Daydreams (1922) shows the early genesis of ideas that would be fully realized in the classic Sherlock Jr., and ends with an exciting chase scene in New York City.
Steamboat Bill Junior was the last film Buster made for producer Joseph M. Schenck.  He would then begin his ill-fated contract with MGM.  After The Camera Man and during Spite Marriage, the sound era began and MGM would team Keaton with Jimmy Durante (bad idea) and then in several mediocre comedies completely mis-using Keaton's talent and forcing severe restrictions on him.  Keaton already in a bad marriage and an alcoholic, allowed his career to be destroyed.
Buster Keaton is one of the top directors, and comics who ever lived.  He experimented with film in ways that none of his contemporaries even dreamed of and in doing so surpasses even Chaplin and Lloyd in terms of genius.  Some of the innovations he explored continue to be used by modern film-makers today.

7844630,5,6303366589,"...I have always been a huge fan of Keaton..but never realized even his silent films ran an hour or two in length!  He was the Master at comic-timing, and his coordination and acrobatic abilities combined with his sight-gag visuals make this a wonderful film to watch. I am always re-impressed with his sense of comedic-timing, coupled with his deadpan,  mildly confused stone-face expression made him a sympathetic character we can all easily relate to...and his pratfalls and agilities make one wonder how he ever got out of bed in the morning after doing these often dangerous and painful stunts....way back when there was no such thing as a stunt-man...

..This film will make you smile, laugh..and gasp often...long before any high-end special visual effects.....and it is a silent-film!",1459209600,2,792,5.171875
