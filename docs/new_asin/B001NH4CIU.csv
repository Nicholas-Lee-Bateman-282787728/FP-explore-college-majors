8326977,2,B001NH4CIU,"It's biggest flaw is that it is so slow moving.  It was painful to watch a character eat pudding for 10 minutes.  It was either a good student project (CMU?) or a bad independant film.  I stopped watching about 1 hour in.  I watched the last bit later, and the end was ok.",1467158400,3,272,4.0754716981132075
8326978,5,B001NH4CIU,"This art film was very good.  I've heard about the art scene in Pittsburgh, PA and this movie certainly shows the type of background available there. I suppose I could call it ""Urban Gothic"". I loved the derelict buildings that were used; they had so much character as ruins and they were just perfect.  I know this was a low budget film but the people who worked on this film deserve the top rating; it really was a beautiful love story.

This is strictly an art film.  It is a silent movie with an excellent music score.  The aesthetics used by the actor and actress to demonstrate their emotions was outstanding.  I gave it a five although you may not like it at all.",1466380800,,670,4.362903225806452
8326979,3,B001NH4CIU,"After seeing all the 5 star customer reviews of this film and reading the hype on the box that referred to it as an amalgam of such masters of weirdness as 'Cronenberg, Lynch, Romero, etc.'  I figured I'd give it a look - heck... I enjoy a neo-old-school gothic silent B&W horror flik as much as the next guy.... it sounded intriguing!

In the aftermath of the viewing experience, however, I'd have to say that this 'indie' effort elicited mixed feelings as to its' (reviewer vaunted)  'brilliance'.  I would give high marks to the film's producers for intent of concept, and some of the photography was visually very artful - many beautifully composed shots, and itz hard for B&W films to not feel 'arty'. Unfortunately, working against these 'positives' was a hard to shake sense of the rather amateurish quality of the production... my 'suspension of disbelief' factor was constantly challenged by the obvious low budget aspect of everything... this really had the feel of a 'film school' project

Noting that the entire piece was filmed in Pittsburgh, PA - I would give the director and cameraman praise for conjuring up a vision that managed to evoke some measure of gothic ambiance, but the  obvious use of derelict buildings as sets and the unshakable sense that the 'actors' were likely non-professional 'friends' of the film-makers kept me from being 'immersed' in the proceedings.  The plot of the film was interesting, but certainly not original, ultimately emerging as sort of a blend between Frankenstein and Phantom of the Opera.  - all the elements were present for a poignant tale, but somehow I didn't find that the total package was very 'engaging'.  The film is listed as being presented in B&W AND color - the 'color' is actually found in certain 'flash-back' scenes that are presented in the 'tinted' (golden) technique that some old silent films employed to provide a 'sense' of color to the monochromatic images. I found the specially written and performed music track to be one of the more interesting aspects of the production - the film title does include the sub-text:  '...A Fugue in the Key of Flesh' and the music did much to help the film.  The 'flesh' element is provided by a few scenes of the (fully) naked 'Esmeralda'  - as her 'mad scientist/lover' 'Doctor Janick' attempts to resuscitate her plague ravaged dead body.

Over-all - I felt 'Prometheus Triumphant'  was a filmic effort that succeeded in some of its' 'intent' and visual elements, but didn't really deliver an engagingly integrated  experience to the viewer.  With a little more budget and 'practice', however,  these could be some emerging film-makers to keep an eye out for.",1408665600,3,2675,4.922048997772828

8326981,5,B001NH4CIU,"Hauntingly beautiful and frightfully endearing. ""Prometheus Triumphant"" is a victorious love story that you wish you could put in a pocket close to your heart and carry it with you always. With no need for spoken words, the score by Lucien Desar is perfectly matched to a visually stunning portrait that gives hope in tragity for the dreamers at heart. An absolute Opus for its time--this film has broken the mold for the silent films of a new generation.",1234569600,,455,4.772151898734177
8326982,5,B001NH4CIU,"I was in LA a few weeks ago and happened to catch the theatrical run of Prometheus Triumphant.  I was blown away.  This film had some of the most amazing cinematography, costume design, set design, and music I have seen (or heard) in a low budget indie film.  And to create a period piece on such a low budget definitely deserves some praise.  I can't wait to pick this movie up on DVD when it comes out, and look forward to seeing what the talented individuals responsible come up with next.  Definitely check this flick out!!",1234224000,,527,4.447916666666667
8326983,5,B001NH4CIU,"--Visually arresting and emotionally enthralling, this film is a masterpiece in re-creating the look, feel, and magic of long-lost silent cinema. Anyone that is a fan of Nosferatu, Frankenstein, or any of the great gothic german expressionistic film of the earlier part of the 20th Century will enjoy what the filmmakers achieved. Further, anyone who enjoys the sweet tragedy of a doomed romance will devour the plight of Prometheus' star-crossed lovers, Janick and Esmeralda, whom even death itself can not keep apart!",1234137600,,519,5.341463414634147
8326984,5,B001NH4CIU,"stunning... haunting... this film follows you after viewing with its pure hypnotic power. Like a Quay Brothers animation enacted with flesh and blood actors, Prometheus enmeshes itself into your psyche and dwells inside your Id, a brilliant technical and artistic acheivement in the tradition of Murnau, Florey, Browning and Whale.",1233014400,4,331,5.64
