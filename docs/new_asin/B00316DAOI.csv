4048304,5,B00316DAOI,"In an era when movie companies repeat same ol' / same ol' because testing the frontier is too scary for them, the folks that put Yesterday Was A Lie together pushed the envelop and created something very new and quite bold, something that tests your mind, challenges your thoughts and makes you wonder why others don't try creating new art.

Film noir styled with a complicated plot rooted in metaphysical science fiction, Yesterday Was A Lie is  probably the most wondrous film produced in the last year or two. The film itself is stunning to view, its stylistic production pulling your eyes toward the screen at every corner. And, while your visual senses are snuggled in the long suspenseful shadows and metaphysical fogs of silk so thick you can feel them in the theatre, in period styles so long forgotten that it would require science fiction itself to ressurect them, the twisting journey of the complex tale tests your mind to new boundries and thus provides you with a challenge worthy of your time.

Yesterday Was A Lie is a stupendous event film that breathes life into movie making.",1265673600,8,1094,4.777777777777778
4048305,5,B00316DAOI,"I was recommended to see this film, didn't think i would like it. I was very surprised. It was way better than i expected. It had a thought provoking plot, looked amazing and the score was unbelievable. I highly recommend this film!",1261612800,9,232,4.5476190476190474
4048306,5,B00316DAOI,Metaphysical mystery told in the film noir style. Brilliant. I can watch it again and again finding new treasures each time. Loved it.,1284854400,4,134,4.869565217391305
4048307,5,B00316DAOI,"A little confusing in the beginning, until you realize that's part of the plot.  I really enjoyed this film and would recommend it to everyone.",1275955200,2,143,4.72
4048308,4,B00316DAOI,"Private Detective Hoyle hot on the trail of an elusive man and a missing notebook. Holye's only help along the way are her partner and a mysterious lounge singer. But Hoyle's progress is hindered as reality and time seems to be shifting around her.

In a unique blend of noir and science fiction, Yesterday Was a Lie is in a category all its own. Shot completely in black and white, the stunning visuals and accompanying jazz music adds to the noir feel - and in my opinion, takes the film to a whole new level. Actresses Kipleigh Brown (Hoyle) and Chase Masterson (Lounge Singer) are wonderful choices for their roles, and skillfully pull the audience into the story.

Ambiance aside, this is like no other noir or science fiction film ever made. At its heart, this is a story of love and heartbreak. But this is not some frivolous, light-hearted flick. Viewers have to pay attention and be able to handle a lot of metaphysical and scientific jargon throughout. Scenes often jump around in time, yet we follow Hoyle as she uncovers the ultimate and surprising mystery. It's smart, gutsy, and glamorous - and completely unexpected. This thoroughly enjoyable film should be a treat for science fiction fans.

DVD Details:
Yesterday Was a Lie is rated PG, 89 minutes long, and contains loads of featurettes and behind-the-scenes clips.",1274054400,6,1333,4.837719298245614
4048309,5,B00316DAOI,"Yesterday Was a Lie is a love story for cerebral cineastes. It was a delight to watch after dinner with a philosophy professor friend and three glasses of wine, and it belongs right up there with your volumes of Wittgenstein. Upon more sober viewing, my analytic mind felt challenged. Actually, this reflects the film's purposeful plotting. Being a psychiatrist, let's see what I can offer.

  First off, the film exemplifies Godard's maxim that all it takes to make a movie is a girl and a gun. In this case the lead female character(s) are two lovely blondes (Chase Masterson of Deep Space 9 fame and newcomer Kipleigh Brown). Each so cleverly resembles the other that one is reminded of Bunuel's That Discreet Object of Desire, the surrealist flick where two separate actresses played one character.

  But adding layers of complexity here, these twin-like actresses are also playing the left and right sides of the brain of the feminine aspect (anima) of one male character. Got that? They all meet at the Pigeon Hole lounge. The first character is the young Hoyle, a feminine Bogart/Sam Spade analytic detective - the left side brain. Like Sam she likes the gin and the story straight. The second is a sultry, un-named singer who has a familiarity with the poetics of T.S. Eliot - the brain's right side. Her music is entrancing, her wit intuitive and non-linear. Together, these two provide the counterpoint of Jung's anima to the male animus of the main character, John Dudas.

  Whether Hoyle and her counterpart, The Singer, convince us they are our anima is irrelevant as we so want them to be part of us. These lovelies draw us ever so seductively into imagining the dark recesses of our own beautiful unconscious, despite whatever misgivings. All we're here for is love, we are told. The shape of the universe is a relationship - functional or otherwise - whether the relationship with our inner parts or with our fellow beings. This makes for a strange little Jungian romp in luscious black and white footage ala Bogart and Bacall. This is David Lynch with an underlying premise. Somewhat like the film Pi, this low budget beauty was made at the cost of Pi (made at $60,000) times pi, about two hundred thousand dollars!

  So, have you read Jung, had a few mysterious dreams, find yourself in need of some clues? First time director James Kerwin makes for a Jungian fortune teller taking us on a trip to disentangle or re-entangle our male and female halves. Kerwin is an urban shaman who shows us the conventional mind as a ""surge suppressor"". Our conscious minds filter small broken bits of time in a lame attempt to tell a story. Does it matter whether they ""add up""?

  Beginning with some obvious allegory, the locks are broken off the allegorical unconscious and our character, curiously named Hoyle bravely walks into a poetic film noir journey to confront the Self. (Hoyle seems named after transcendental astronomer/physicist Fred Hoyle who was deeply intrigued by the ""Anthropic Principle"" of nature.) We begin with a look at Dali's surrealist masterpiece The Persistence of Memory in a hallway. They meet Schrdinger's cat, the parable of which tells us there are opposite angles on everything and only by choosing do we arrives at any definitive perspective. Free Will is discussed. The film reveals a Jungian Fenestra Aeternitatus, a window to the eternal, that our characters need to navigate.

  A variety of other cutting edge consciousness theories are peppered throughout the film to spice the intellectual interest of the knowledgeable viewer, including pondering Planck's constant, a number describing the fundamental vibration at the Ground of Being. For those less informed, the film literally goes back to the psychiatrist to explain itself. Jung, we are told, said a man needs to project his animus onto the feminine anima in order to unlock the secrets of the universe. This is a film for men who are in need of seeing themselves and for women who want a deeper look into those men. What does a man see in himself as a woman?

  Hoyle goes into a dream within a dream (hasn't everyone had at least one of these?) to contact her animus, Dudas, who has a notebook of important thoughts or ideas. Meanwhile we are constantly asked, what if our theories, concepts of self, and common sense don't add up? And what does that tell us about our relationships? And what is the nature and consequence of the loss of ""relationship""? The right-sided feminine asks the questions. Left-sided Hoyle tries to read the tea leaves, the pattern in the chaos. Hoyle and her doppelganger meet another aspect of their animus, a scientist who explains the nature of time and who feels these two sexy blondes are ""better"" and ""better"". They are also the choices that interface with reality. They will help us overcome our own guilt about our very existence and the broken promises to ourselves and to others.

  A deep understanding of time is seen in this film's Feynman diagram writ large in cinema. Physicist Feynman showed everything else might be one mind/particle bouncing backwards and forwards in time, appearing as each and all of us trying to make contact with every part of experience over eternity, the very fabric of time. This reach for the eternal is countered by the Shadow, the dark side, who delivers a bit of lead poisoning in the form of bullets. Death's shadow is a terrifying/exhilarating lockdown on the many-sided reality of now, it haunts our Selves. It occurs when we bring our stories to a halt. We need to let go of our life-text and grab onto our fuller selves, leaving our memories to be what they are and move on to script ourselves anew.

  This film is an ultimate romance with ""The Other"", a mix of the cosmos and the chaos, the order and the disorder, the male and the female. In this cocktail lounge of our emotions, letting go of our primordial selfishness lets our unconscious sing its own songs, reconciling the Self to itself. And pay attention to that terrific music in here. Chase Masterson sings beautifully the lounge songs of our longing.

  As T.S. Eliot is quoted:
  And the end of all our exploring
  Will be to arrive where we started
  And know the place for the first time
  Through the unknown, unremembered gate.

Happy filmgoing!",1271980800,18,6297,4.822325581395349
4048310,1,B00316DAOI,I'm not sure where to start just like the movie doesn't know where to start. First take a badly written story then place it in a blender and tape it back together.,1271721600,3,163,4.125
4048311,5,B00316DAOI,"I had the pleasure of seeing this movie during its NY CITY premier last year.
I enjoyed first time director JAMES KERWIN's movie very much especially like the way he combined film noir and sci fi into an interesting and thought provoking combination
Kipleigh Brown was wonderful in the lead role.
I can't say enough about the talented Chase Masterson",1270771200,7,350,4.85
4048312,5,B00316DAOI,"I think the best way to describe some of what this film has to offer came right from Kerwin himself: A film about having quantum mechanics be the basis for showing human heartbreak. As the stars stated several times in the supplements, you will get something out of this film each time you watch it - and I will be watching it again. Describing the story almost does this piece a disservice, but sufficed to say it challenges the viewer and is one of the most intellectual and intriguing independent films to come out in years.

This is a film that could REALLY use a Blu treatment, but the transfer manages to still show the black and white experience in a strong and competent fashion. The music, cinematography, lighting, character physicalities and performances all get mixed together beautifully in this digital film. The 5.1 is utilized most with the singing, jazz and assorted score. The digital picture has a perfect softness for how this B&W result displays, and mixed with how beautiful the lead ladies are you end up actually appreciating the lack of color - the result was mesmerizing.

The supplements have seven segments of interviews and behind the scenes from cast and crew. Kerwin's enthusiasm shows through in each talking head piece, and the level of passion shown by every person involved with this project, makes the whole bit watchable. Two 20-30 shot photo galleries show pics from filming and the resulting production. It was almost a shock to see color in the behind-the-scenes photos - but it gives a great reference for how much better it was to have this be B&W. If you are a fan of either lead lady - there are some save-worthy pics here. A couple of trailers are thrown in also as the last addition. English language with subtitles in same. A graphic novel preview is also included in the packaging. 4.5 for the film and presentation, .5 for the supplements. Hope you get a chance to watch this adult-oriented PG film about an alternative viewpoint of love lost.",1270684800,15,1992,4.737752161383285
4048313,5,B00316DAOI,"Producer Chase Masterson and writer/director James Kerwin have created a wonderful film harkening back to the days of great film noir.

Stunning black and white photography gives this film an incredible look, tone, and mood which big Hollywood studios seemingly have forgotten how to make.

The film is challenging and engaging.  The viewer is in the dark initially and on the same ride of discovery as Kipleigh Brown's character.  Kudos to James Kerwin for respecting viewers intelligence and ability to figure things out, and more importantly for knowing viewers do want to be challenged this way, and are tired of dumbed down mainstream Hollywood movies.

Fine performances by all, but especially great work from leads Kipleigh Brown and Chase Masterson.

The commentary track with James Kerwin, Chase Masterson, and Kipleigh Brown is far superior to that found on most DVD releases.

The music score and arrangements by Kristopher Carter are perfectly matched to this film. Chase Masterson's performance of ""Where Do You Start"" over the last scenes is one of, if not the best, performance of this song I've heard.

Yesterday Was a Lie is not to be missed.",1270598400,12,1159,5.095238095238095
4048314,5,B00316DAOI,"It's refreshing to see a film so original and thought provoking that would never have been made in the traditional studio system.  It doesn't fit the Hollywood formula, (thankfully),  but it completely delivers on so many fronts.  Amazing performances, cinematography, direction, score...the list goes on.  If you're looking for something a little different and not your typical movie faire, check out this movie.",1270512000,7,413,5.507936507936508

8386624,3,B00316DAOI,"If the acting were better, I'd give it four stars. Unique concept, storyline, could be a fun ride, but the acting is so stilted for the most part that I found it hard to watch. Loved the Jungian, ""deeper wave than this"" concepts intertwined. I loved the use of black and white film. But overall worth a watch, especially if you are into some of the outlying psychological theories.",1476230400,,381,4.536231884057971
8386625,5,B00316DAOI,"COOL OFF. RELAX. DIM THOSE ULTRA LOUNGE LIGHTS. THIS MOVIE IS DRIPPING WITH 1940'S-1960'S RETRO CULTURE. VERY SEXY MYSTERY MOVIE IN GLORIOUS BLACK AND WHITE.

8386626,3,B00316DAOI,"its very cerebral, you have to be familiar with the concepts of multiple dimension, time travel and paradoxes.
If you can understand where they are trying to go, you will enjoy the film. It may take some people a second, or even third viewing to really get it.
I liked it, but I'm a real geek for this kind of stuff.  It's a rally good independent Science Fiction story, not sci-fi.",1401753600,,382,4.380281690140845
8386627,3,B00316DAOI,"The movie is interesting to look at, having been shot on video and then manipulated to produce a rich black-and-white palette.  It appears to have been shot using four spotlights and a smoke machine.  And the beauty of video is that you can do this and otherwise fool around with your visuals, and if it looks bad, just redo it right away.  The story apparently has to do with psychological concepts beyond my ken and consequently left me about as puzzled as the young lady in the fedora hat who doesn't know what's going on, either.",1366243200,,533,4.53125
8386628,5,B00316DAOI,This film pretty much was a mind blower. The combination of crime noir and quantum physics was no less than original. I'll have to watch this again (and again) to even try to wrap my head around it.,1360368000,,198,4.2368421052631575
8386629,3,B00316DAOI,Had a hard time getting into this movie.  Watched part of it.  Maybe I'll try to watch it again someday.,1359676800,,104,4.15
8386630,1,B00316DAOI,"I have not seen many movies more boring and uninteresting than this one.  I have loved some very mainstream to off-beat movies but this film is absolutely horrid.  The acting is completely amateurish and the main character's wardrobe is ridiculous in appearance.  This film is a waste even if you get it free.  If this was truly science fiction, I would never watch it.  Thankfully, this movie is not science fiction.  Thankfully, movies like Source Code, Limitless and many others, validate the genre.",1314230400,,502,4.9879518072289155
8386631,5,B00316DAOI,"I'm tempted to say they don't make them like this anymore, but the truth is I've never seen a film anything at all like this before. For the viewer, there is absolutely no room to be complacent; it will take multiple viewings to take in, and new aspects will emerge with each viewing. An incredible script, incredible direction, and incredible performances, just incredible film making, period. Go get it, and begin the journey.............",1312588800,3,440,5.041095890410959
8386632,5,B00316DAOI,Liked how the movie kept me guessing. Originally watched it on Netflix and liked it so well I bought it.,1311379200,,104,4.25
8386633,2,B00316DAOI,"This film is like a reflecting pool.  It looks deep and dark, but it turns out to be about three inches deep.

The stunning look of the film belies its shallowness.  The deep shadows and brilliant highlights make the case that more movies should be made in black and white.  The concepts could have been interesting to explore, but the wooden acting and stilted dialog made it painful to watch, pain which was relieved only when ogling Ms Masterson and Ms Kipleigh.

All in all it seemed to me to be a case of a screenwriter/director writing a first draft, then filming it.  With a little bit of polish applied to the storyline and script, this film could have been really good.",1289520000,,678,4.516393442622951
