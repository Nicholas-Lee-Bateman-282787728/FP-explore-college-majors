3977798,5,B002S0FR6M,The is an awesome DVD set.  I take pretty good pictures but had no concept of how or why.  This explains things so well that I understand that subjects like composition and lighting come naturally to me while the settings on the camera are a little more challenging.  Manny explains these basic concepts so well that you UNDERSTAND what is happening and why when you use different settings.  I have watched the complete set twice and will watch them again I am sure.  I would highly recommend this set.  I am wondering if there is a set for the next step in my learning.,1270944000,,570,4.4326923076923075
3977799,5,B002S0FR6M,"I HIGHLY!!!! recommend this DVD for anyone wanting to master and improve their camera techniques AND application of photography principles.  It's the best I've seen!

First, as other reviewers have noted, he has a gift/talent for explaining AND DEMONSTRATING!!! the basic principles of photography such as F stops, aperture, ISO, and shutter speed in ways that you can feel confident in applying.  In other words, he shows how to apply the principles...not just understand them.

Secondly, as others have noted, he is very engaging...presenting the information in a down-to-earth, friendly way that encourages you to want to pick up a camera and go try it.  (In fact, that's his mantra...practice...practice...practice...today...now...not next week...or at some future date.)

What I ESPECIALLY appreciated is how he took these concepts
I kind_of, sort_of...but actually not quite..
understood and explained them in ways that led to the BINGO/EUREKA moment.

Example...I basically understood that the light metering system of any camera (or light meter) is based on the assumption that the scene reflects approximately 18 percent of the light which falls on it...
but he explains it so clearly...that I feel like I now REALLY grasp it...not just theoretically.  AND he provides a perfect example...that not only demonstrates the principle
...and this is REALLY great...
he shows how to use the histogram to achieve the exposure you want...utilizing the 18% rule...rather than being fooled by it.

There are other similar examples of where he takes some principles I've read about...thought I understood...but he helps me to finally nail it.

It's rare to find someone so gifted in teaching!

I kind of like it better than a regular class...because if you don't quite get it...you can replay that section until you do!

In summary...a fantastic teaching tool.  And it boosted my confidence that I could get the shot...I pictured!",1270252800,,1928,5.344370860927152

3977801,5,B002S0FR6M,"This three DVD set covers all of the basics, plus more!

Within the three DVD set, Manny discusses the topics of Composition, Camera Functions and Lighting.

The ""Composition"" DVD features segments on the Dominant Subject Rule, Formal and Informal Composition. The ""Camera Functions"" DVD features in depth explanations of the following topics: the Lens (Normal, Wide Angle, Telephoto and Zoom), Exposure, F/Stops, Shutter Speeds, ISO and ""Putting it All Together."" The ""Lighting"" DVD teaches the photographer how to use a camera, on Manual settings, without a flash. Very interesting discussion regarding Light Ratio, Flat Lighting and demonstrations of applying flat lighting techniques to indoor and outdoor settings. I may never use the ""Automatic"" setting on my camera again!

Manny is an excellent instructor! His teaching techniques provide the viewer with terminology and techniques that are easy to understand and implement right away. Follow his advice ... watch the DVDs in order, all the way through - the techniques do build upon one another.

Another very pleasant surprise is that Manny doesn't promote any one brand of equipment; not once does he mention the brand of camera he uses; refreshing to watch an instructional DVD that actually focuses on ""instructing"" instead of selling the ""benefits"" of a major manufacturer.

Put my name on the waiting list for Manny's next instructional DVD set! Well worth the investment!",1268438400,,1437,5.368888888888889

I was so impressed that I ordered the other two sets ""The Skilled Photographer"" and ""The Ultimate Photographer"" immediately after viewing this one in it's entirety!

After reviewing the product on two occasions months apart, I felt the 3 diskettes could have easily been rolled into one as similar material was repeated far too often, albeit in different ways and using different examples. Honestly, despite the author's best pedagogical intentions, I was bored and had a hard-time concentrating because of unnecessary and diffuse conversation. The presenter is certainly a likeable guy, I initially enjoyed his banter, but overall this was too elementary and the content repeated itself too often.

While there are certainly multiple pluses to these DVD's, among them being the repeatability (for some), how to ""best"" take a snapshot/picture, and his easy banter, specifics of integrating speed, aperture and color-balance were conspicuously superficial.",1383091200,2,928,5.535211267605634

- the DVD's arrived in a very timely manner
- at first I thought the concepts were too simple. When I went out and tried the techniques I very quickly realized I was wrong. Sometimes small changes create big results. I saw an immediate improvement in my photo's and even in the way I approached photography process. It was much easier for me to figure out a subject and set up a basic composition.
- he encourages you to go out after watching the DVD and apply what you learn. This is the true value in the video. It's not something you can just sit and watch and wait for things to happen. Once you take action and start applying the concepts you learn.
- he very clearly explained all of the technical jargon. I didn't feel intimidated at all and now know more of the intricacies of the light meter.

cons's
- It leaves you wanting more.

3977820,5,B002S0FR6M,"Emanuel Pontoriero, or Manny as he is called by his students, is a great teacher. This is the first of 3 DVD sets that approach the teaching of composition,lighting and camera craft in a straight forward and overall comprehensive way. In this first set, ""Jump Start Your Photography,"" Manny introduces the viewer to the basic the rules of Composition and lighting in his easy to understand manner that allows the beginner to start using these techniques immediately. Manny makes it clear that after each disc, the viewer should put the material to immediate use by going out and practicing with his/her camera to reinforce the teaching. In his later sets: The Skilled Photographer and the Ultimate Photographer, he layers on more complex material but always, as a master teacher should, circling back  to earlier, more basic rules from both photography and classical art.

The presentation is clear,logical and quite comprehensive -- it's almost like being in a studio and out in the field with a master photographer. Every time I view these 3 sets (and I am on my 3rd time now), I can't help thinking how lucky I was to decide to invest in them. I have begun to see things differently - photographically - and I am sure my photos have improved because of it. This has led me to buy his Portrait DVD as well as his 2 DVDs set on Landscape Photography. They are also as interesting, informative and enjoyable as the earlier ones.

Get the first set and I guarantee that you will buy them all. Do yourself a favor.",1329955200,,1512,4.69811320754717

He talks about mostly portrait photography and there is nothing about landscape photography.  He focuses on capturing the emotions of people with property composition and lighting, but does not care about the background.  I disagree with his point that background is unimportant.

3977825,3,B002S0FR6M,"This DVD set is a good overview of the various techniques someone can use to improve their photography.  That said, what this DVD set fails in is that the overal presentation on how to employ his techniques is weak.  While Manny shows you how to employ the techniques or ""rules"" as he calls it,  the scenes he used for the composition is tad on the weak side. Landscape is dull, confusing or distracting.  Subject matter is not very interesting.  At times, if you showed someone his photos, a normal person might not even figure what the subject was. It seems he wanted to teach the techniques based on whatever he could find and instead of finding the best scene, subject or composition for his technique.  Clearly Manny is a portrait shooter, but he tries to show you different techniques with different types of photography.  While nothing is wrong with his techniques, the fact that his choice in poor scenes or subjects reduces the professionalism of this DVD set. Even tho this is a DVD set, the resolution seems low and it almost appears he made the video off of iMovie.  If you're a pro and you want to sell a training dvd set, at least use the best composition to exhibit that technique and not some scene you found down the street.  Photography is a visual art, make it at least visually appealing.  That said 3 stars for good techniques, but I had to knock of stars for the poor presentation of said techniques.  Sadly, some youtube videos have better production quality, and its free.",1322870400,10,1496,4.607547169811321

I found this DVD series on Amazon and just finished watching it, it is GREAT for beginners, I sure wish I had it when I started learning photography..
In the first DVD, Manny talks in details about composition and gives some valuable tips on how to make your photo looks much better "" The dominant subject, formal & informal composition "", then he talks about exposure in the second DVD explaining shutter speed, Aperture and ISO, in a simple and easy to understand way, he also explains lens types and when to use them.
In the third DVD he talks about different lighting situations, benefits of shooting during golden hour, and gives some examples about closeup and product photography..
The thing I liked the most about this set was the hands on shooting, as Manny filmed the shooting and explained step by step how to do it "" Choosing location, Posing your subject, Holding the cam... "" and showed pictures of before and after making some changes to get the perfect photo.

It's also worth mentioning that Manny uses a layman language and avoids difficult terms which makes these DVDs easier to understand for beginners!!

These concepts include composition, camera function, lighting, and the psychology behind these techniques. Manny reinforces the concepts with the real demonstrations of taking pictures in the fields.

Various practical problems including some with the actual course material of NYIP forced me to look someplace else. Now to the actual review of the product:-

I found this product to be very useful. It not only re-enforced some the concepts I already knew, in-fact, it taught me plenty of new stuff and that too in record time. All the fundamentals are the same, it is how you teach them that makes the difference. Manny's way of teaching 'composition' and 'exposure' was very effective.

There are some people who like to learn by reading & some by listening/viewing. I belong to the latter. If you want to start learning the basics of photography then this is it. Sure, there are a few gray areas as well e.g. the effect of increase/decrease in aperture on the bokeh (shallow depth of field) is not explained, the trade-offs of adjusting light by a factor using ISO, Shutter Speed & Aperture should have been explained, considering the amount of space left in each of the discs. Maybe it is in the second set of discs i.e. 'Skilled Photographer' which I have bought as well. I am so impressed with the first set that I am going to buy the Ultimate discs set as well. I give it a solid 4.5/5 .

After watching these 3 DVDs and practicing the techniques I learned my photography game has stepped way up.  My photos are coming out so much better and I am able to get much more creative with my shots now that I know what all the settings on the camera do.

We didn't have to time to take a live photography classes so we figure that we'd start with instructional DVDs then advance to live work shops as our skills improve.  This DVD is such an amazing starting point.

What we like about this series:

1.  Manny.  Manny is a wonderful communicator.  Made some of the more confusing concepts such as aperature, ect. understandable for us beginners.
3.  Very well produced.  Good sound, videos, examples.
3.  Covers all the basics to get you started in photography.  After going through the 3 DVD, our picture skills improved immensely.  We are now beginner photographers, not just snap shooters.

What we don't like so much:

1.  Although the DVD is mean for all types of cameras, it's really most useful for DSLR users.
2.  As good as the DVDs are, there are times during the video that we wish we have a live instructors to ask questions.

Overall, we love this DVD series.  Great start for the beginner.  We'll move onto Manny's more advanced DVDs in the future.",1315180800,,1091,4.677248677248677

Manny is simply amazing on explaining things in a very simple way.  If you want to take your exposures to next level, this DVD set is a must have.  I can see a lot improvement in my exposures, right from the composition to, correct exposure and then to take a perfect exposure outdoors..

Here are what Manny talks about in each of the DVDs

DVD1:  Various compositional techniques with lot of examples..
DVD2:  Taking correct exposure and walk you thru photographic triangle and why/how M mode is so flexible
DVD3:  About lighting, more specifically without using any expensive equipments and Manny teaches how to take correct exposures under various lighting condition..

Even before watching Manny's DVDs, I was using M mode but after watching DVD2, boy!, I learned a whole bunch of new things and now the number of exposures I throw away has significantly reduced..

A must have DVD set, if you want to improve your photographic skills.

I have become a big fan of Manny and he has a few very good videos in YouTube as well..
Can't wait for his next set of DVDs.

Manny has a gift for communicating the intricacies of taking a picture which turns out to be a great photograph. If you watch the DVDs in order and go out and practice what Manny has taught you right away, it will become an ingrained skill.

The key that makes learning how to take great pictures easy this 3 DVD set, is Manny doesn't just tell you how to do it, he shows you how to do it. He shows you what the mistakes the average person makes and how to professionally correct those mistakes easily. He give you just the right amount of detail so you enjoy learning the specific skills and come away with an in depth understanding of what you are doing and why.

I can't wait to get started on the second set of DVDs, ""The Skilled Photographer"".",1306108800,,1045,4.2944162436548226
3977839,5,B002S0FR6M,"I really enjoyed this tutorial.  It is VERY basic (I guess I knew more about photography than I thought), but is a great starting block for someone new to photography.  I ordered both this DVD set and ""The Skilled Photographer"" DVD set by the same artist.  If you are looking to purchase ""The Skilled Photographer"", I would definitely recommend purchasing ""Jump Start Your Photography"", as ""The Skilled Photographer"" builds on the concepts covered in this first DVD set.  Without it, you may be a little lost, and although it is very basic, there is always something to be learned (or reminded of).",1303084800,3,598,4.833333333333333
3977840,5,B002S0FR6M,"I purchased my first digital SLR approximately 4 years ago. Since that time I have watched numerous training videos and read several books on photography.""Jump Start Your Photography"" is by far the first of my best investments as far as photography training. The techniques and demonstrations discussed are simplified and made visual by Manny who I feel has a gift with communication and explaining concepts in a simplified manner. I am not a professional photographer nor do I pride myself in Photo shop skills. The learning gained from this DVD has almost eliminated the need for Photo shop skills.

I also do not shoot in any other mode other then manual since watching this DVD. This improvement has moved me from taking pictures to taking and creating photographic experiences. I love to travel and take pictures and now my pitches really stand out thanks to Manny. Above I mentioned that purchasing this DVD was one of my best photography investments. It has only been surpassed by ""Posing with Attitude"" and ""The Skilled Photographer"" both by Get The Picture. I strongly recommend all three DVD's without reservation, however, they should be watched in sequence as one builds on the next.

The investment in all three titles are training tools that can be utilized over and over and I for one have learned something each time that I have watched them.",1299542400,3,1358,4.925764192139738
3977841,5,B002S0FR6M,"This is, by far, the best set of DVDs for beginner's out there. Where others try to squeeze composition, camera functions and lighting on one DVD, Manny takes the time to explain each lesson in more detail. After teaching the lesson topic, he takes the viewer to various locations and demonstrates (while still teaching) the topic using several different scenarios.

If you're a beginner and want to learn how to take great photographs (not just point-and-shoot), watch his DVDs. You'll be amazed at how much better your photographs start to look the moment you begin practicing his lessons with your camera.",1298764800,,608,5.01980198019802

This is how strongly I feel about the quality and value of his productions. As an amateur wildlife photographer for over 30 years I have studied every teaching aid that I have been able to afford. And this material as well as Manny's second production in this series is by far and away the most valuable addition's in my library. These of course focus on portrait photography but do not be fooled by the subject matter. This will improve your photography regardless of the discipline. The instruction will apply to wildlife photography equally as well. This instruction is simple to understand and apply and highly motivational as well. After watching the very first DVD, an investment of about 45 minutes, my photography improved 100%. And I understood many of the techniques I have studied over the last 30 years and still did not quite understand. If you want to fast track your learning curve this is the best investment you can make.",1298678400,4,1072,4.8

I took the New York Institute course myself back in the 90's, but it is very expensive!  This course gives many good rules and tips, and I would recommend it highly to anyone.  Also, one of our dvd's was sticking, and they promptly and courteously sent us another copy.  Very nice people! Very good course!",1295308800,,397,4.383561643835616

Manny is a great teacher, friendly, enthusiastic and caring. He moves at a comfortable pace, making difficult concepts seem simple. Manny uses lots of visuals, with examples of him putting into practice what he teaches. He also shows you not only what to do, but what not to do.

One of the DVDs would not play, so I called about it and my call was returned immediately. Manny was very friendly and polite and my replacement DVD was rushed out about an hour later.

Whether you want to be a professional photog or just want to take better pics, Manny really cares about your success. Do yourself a favor and let him teach you. You'll be glad you did.",1295308800,,793,4.462068965517242

I have purchased many books and DVD's on photography before but this set is my absolute favorite.  By the time you get to the third DVD, you will be at intermediate level or higher depending on where you started.  I listened to all three DVD's on my way over to Asia on my flight and by the time I landed, I was ready to shoot great photographs.  I returned with some wonderful photos taken during my trip.  I have been to all of these places many times before but I never came back with good photos until now.  I high recommend this set to anyone interested in photography.  Even though it's a little bit more expensive than other DVD's, its well worth every penny.  I just ordered the sequel to this set ""skilled photographer"".  I will review that set once I get them and have a chance to review the DVD's in that set.",1292889600,,907,4.313609467455621
3977846,5,B002S0FR6M,"This is the best introduction to photography DVD I have seen.  Three DVDs packed with information with a pace of presentation targeted for the beginning photographer.  DVD 1 is about DSLR camera, DVD 2 is Composition, DVD 3 is taking Pictures.

A little about myself: I started taking pictures in the '70s in high school photography, I then worked at a commercial photography studio with all the best equipment... I did not persue photography as my career, but I have owned 4x5 and medium format cameras along with SLRs and DSLRs.

I purchased this DVD set for my 21 yr old daughter who wanted to get into DSLR photography.  She got a Canon T2i as a B-day present and was a bit intimidated...  I know that without more technical knowledge, my daugher would not take any better pictures (compositionally and creatively) than with a pocket camera.

This video is excellent! I can not say enough how good this video set is. I learned a few things too.

After purchasing this DVD set I did not hesitate to buy the other to DVD sets, ""The Skilled Photographer"", and ""Posing with an Attitude"".  ""The Skilled Photographer"" picks up where ""Jump Start Your Photography"" left off but the second DVD is still presented for the beginning photographer wanting to use their camera better, learn more about photographic composition, and some more about lighing.",1291680000,10,1346,4.817391304347826
3977847,5,B002S0FR6M,"My mother has recently retired and has been interested in photography for as long as she can remember. Being a professional photographer at one stage in my life, before digital cameras, I have tried to help her as best I can. Unfortunately I reside in the US whereas she lives in Australia, this mission isn't easy as I can't be ""hands on"" with her.

Initially I purchased 3 books for her, being ""UNDERSTANDING EXPOSURE"", ""UNDERSTANDING SHUTTER SPEED"" and ""EXPOSURE PHOTO WORKSHOP"" which I highly recommend as a secondary source for knowledge. She has studied all three books but was still uncertain about particular aspects of what I call, traditional photography, which made me search for a more intuitive learning aid.

For reference, my mother was a concert harpist, concert pianist and later in life a vocal coach for the University. Added to this she managed to learn 3 other languages, so the point I'm trying to make is that hard work and practice isn't a new thing for her.

I have just finished watching the 3 DVD's by Emanuele Pontoriero to ensure that it would not be a waste of time for my mother to watch. I am totally blown away as he has managed to concisely explain the basic skills and knowledge in such a way that I can't imagine anyone (as long as they had the desire), not being able to attain the skills needed to become a fantastic photographer.

Final word.

3977848,5,B002S0FR6M,"After  a number of decades taking point & shoot photographs, I decided it would be more creative and artisitic to actually have more control over my photos.  I've run the usual gamut of ""introductory books"" and found the books to be somewhat informative (barely), but usually stilted and text-bookey, without real incentive to want to 'get out there and learn photography' the right way.  I  bought my first DSLR, read through the manual, finally bought a book explaining the manual (also helpful). This was a beginning, but I still didn't assimilate what the author wrote.  I happened upon the Jump Start Your Photography dvd set, ordered them, spent much of the night watching the videos. Manny makes learning fun.  He is obviously a master of his subject matter, passionate about his craft without being preachy, entertaining without being over the top.  He is the good professor you remember from college (decades later) that helped you to visualize the concepts so you really learned and not just went through the motions.

I actually went out and took lots and lots of pictures and I'm still taking more.  I bought 2 good lenses and have since revisted parts of the the video.  I can now  analyze where I've gone wrong, and wonderfully, where I've actually improved my shots based on the instruction in the video.

I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD set, especially for those that want to make the change from point & shoot or automatic settings, but never had the right motivation.",1287619200,,1489,4.888446215139442

3977851,3,B002S0FR6M,"Pros:
A many good tips for taking pictures for different events. Manny cover several topics such as angle to take pictures, lights, exposure techniques and posing.

Cons:
ALL photos should (and not few of them) have the exposure information (aperture, ISO, shutter, WB, etc). Information about taking pictures for others events would be nice in this DVD such as; sports, social events, nature, etc

Do I recommend it?
Definitely yes, the DVD has good information about how to start taking pictures.

I would give it 3  stars but the AMAZON system for rating did not let me

3977853,5,B002S0FR6M,I have a Nikon D40 that I purchased a couple of years ago. I'd been using it only on auto mode which was a waste of the camera's more extensive features.  Even after buying and reading a book on how to use my camera I never felt comfortable venturing to the manual setting. I've only had this DVD set a few weeks and watched it through once. I'm already so glad I purchased it. I immediately set my camera on manual and have only ventured back to auto when photographing a high action shot that I didn't want to experiment with. It's the boost I needed. Although I still feel like a beginner I've learned so much already and plan to view the DVD set at least one more time. Manny explains everything so well and makes each subject easy to understand. You can take better photographs with any camera using his information.

I am an amateur photographer and have bought books, attended classes, watched online tutorials, and had a personal mentoring session with a professional photographer.  Of all this training, Manny's DVD's taught me the most.  Here are some reasons why I highly recommend this training set:
1. Manny presents the material in a clear, concise, and thorough manner.  Some simple concepts that I previously struggled with finally made sense when watching these DVDs.  You don't get just a portion of the information, like most online videos provide.
2. He uses repetition and real life examples so that you don't just hear the explanation once but that you truly understand the concept.
3. He uses the ""Manny cam"" to show you live photo shoots.  It was helpful to see how Manny interacts with the client.  It also helped to further drive home the concepts.
4. Manny has a very likeable on camera personality.  He seems easy going and the type of person you would want to have as your mentor.

I will be anxiously anticipating future DVD releases from Manny as I am sure they will be of the same quality.

For those who aren't professional photographer's yet, you will find these DVDs an invaluable resource!  Do not hesitate to buy as you will learn a lot!",1432339200,,1410,4.776859504132231
