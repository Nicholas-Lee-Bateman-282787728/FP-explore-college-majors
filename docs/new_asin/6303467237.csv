652145,5,6303467237,"This movie really is worth getting, and keeping for years and years for future generations.  My sister and I were really big into the Feature Films for Families collections as children. They are all really great and all have an awesome message for any age.  I highly recommend having all these classics in your collection for years.  Split Infinity, Rigoletto, The Buttercream Gang, Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken, and many others are a great addition to any family.  Enjoy!!",1254355200,13,472,4.936708860759493

652148,5,6303467237,"I have been searching for this movie for 13 years now. My sister and I first saw this movie on tv back in 1992. Never getting to finish the movie and not knowing the name of it has made me search for it for quite some time now. It is still as exclent as the first time I watched it, back when I was five. I must say it was well worth the wait!!!!",1124150400,5,346,3.689189189189189
652149,5,6303467237,"THIS MOVIE WAS SO GOOD!! IT'S ABOUT THIS YOUNG GIRL AND ALL SHE CARES ABOUT IS MONEY AND SHE GOES BACK IN TIME AND LEARNS THAT THERE IS MORE TO LIFE THAN MONEY AND THAT YOU CAN BE RICH WITH OTHER THINGS, TOO. IT IS SO GOOD!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!",1008892800,9,248,3.8823529411764706
652250,5,6303467237,Released in 1992 this is a fun blast to the past to watch a small town farm gal go back and convince her Grandpa to not sell his farm because the great depression was about to happen.  She uses her skills and knowledge of the future and of enterprise to help save the farm. It's a feature family film and anyone who knows what that is I would say this is better than buttercream gang. It came on amazons market in 2011 and has fluctuated constantly between $4-$10. It peaked at $13 and dropped to as low as 50 cents. Its a fair buy at $5 and anything below is a good deal just based off its rarity.,1469750400,,598,4.067796610169491

652444,5,6303467237,Just used it with my junior high. They got to see the value of people not things and her going back in time ddi not change what took place. She learns too and so do the students. Promotes discussion and is agood story.,1364169600,,218,4.093023255813954

652448,3,6303467237,"Time travel has been a fairly reliable way to let a character see through the eyes of another or time of another. Kirsten Dunst did a supberb job of this in the Holacaust story The Devil's Arithmetic. Neither the story line nor the acting in Split Infinity measures up to that one. Fortunately the acting is not over the top or overly emotive. The main actress here does a reliable job in a script that could have dealt more solidly with the shock of a girl finding herself in another time. It also fails to adequately delve into the greed and corruption that is placing the family in peril. The grandfather/brother's selfishness and then later act of contrition, the central line of the story, was handled in a way that is too simplistic to teach a lesson. And as the DVD's cover proclaims, this is all about teaching your children values.

The children did seem to be enjoying themselves in those pre-recession times, especially compared with those in the modern times when their commercialism was strictly over the top. Come on. How many schools allow that open marketing out of the kids lockers.",1347926400,2,1099,4.694300518134715
652449,5,6303467237,"The customer service was super! It was here before I expected it and they upgraded my shipping for me, which was great because it was for my daughter-in-law's birthday. She loved this show when she was younger and wanted a copy quite badly. Thank you for the hand-written note, as well. I'll use you again! :)",1338076800,,309,4.535714285714286
652450,5,6303467237,"My daughter saw this movie a while ago and wanted to see it again. Our local library didn't have it so I decided to purchase it from Amazon. It's well worth seeing, even though it is a bit far fetched as far as the time travel. The lessons A J  learned in the movie are relevent for anyone today. Money isn't everything, as she soon found out. It is quite funny when she goes back in time and tries wearing the same kind of clothes she is used to wearing in her own time.

  It's a good movie geared towards jr high, but anyone can learn from it.",1330646400,2,546,4.027777777777778
652451,1,6303467237,"I felt a contrarian review was needed after seeing all the glowing reviews of this film.  One reviewer says that the movie was stupid, with cheap laughs, but gives it 5 stars???  Cheap laughs come from very staged scenes.  They wanted to show people being startled, so they have the older boy cleaning the tub at 6 a.m. by getting inside the tub, closing the shower curtain and making no noise - don't think much cleaning is going to get done.  But it does allow the mother and the boy to be startled when she opens the shower curtain and finds him in the tub.
Aside from the adorable, talented canine playing the family dog, the acting is not good.  Still, it's a clean movie that children may find entertaining.",1295568000,,713,4.453846153846154
652452,5,6303467237,"Obviously this is not the best film of all time, in fact it's pretty stupid. The reason I purchased this film was as a present for my sister who would watch this with me when we were kids.  I have always loved this movie and recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap laugh!",1293148800,,274,4.074074074074074
7847583,4,6303467237,"By no means is this a sophisticated story, but as far as family feature films go, there are some fun spins on this tale of the things that really matter.",1510012800,,153,4.133333333333334
7847584,5,6303467237,This a fun movie.  Doesn't take itself too seriously and isn't exactly a high-budget production but it's a fun watch and very concerned with teaching a good life lesson.  I bought it for sentimental sake...I enjoyed it a lot as a kid.,1508198400,,234,4.5476190476190474

7847588,5,6303467237,I originally got this on VHS through one of those mail order things. My grandmother loved ordering through those. This is a clean family film that has a message at heart. It's just a feel good movie.,1497657600,,199,4.405405405405405
