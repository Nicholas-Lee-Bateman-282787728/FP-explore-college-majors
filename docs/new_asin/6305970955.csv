1099757,5,6305970955,"For those of you who consider, like me, that Werner Herzog is one of the great filmmakers of the last 30 years, MY BEST FIEND is essential. Thanks to Anchor Bay, we've already had the chance to hear Herzog commenting AGUIRRE or NOSFERATU for instance. Now, we can apprehend the strange ties of friendship that existed between the visionary director and his favorite actor.
In this documentary, Werner Herzog returns to Germany for a visit to his own mother's appartment where he met Klaus Kinski in the mid-fifties. Kinski had already a strange behaviour then, living naked in a little room with dead leaves all over the floor. Next, Herzog takes the train to Peru in order to watch again the landscapes of AGUIRRE and FITZCARRALDO and to interview indian actors of these movies. At last, he comes back to Czechoslovakia where he directed WOYZECK and NOSFERATU in 1978-1979.
The movie also presents interviews of Claudia Cardinale (Fitzcarraldo) and Eva Mattes (Woyzeck), a ""behind the screen"" approach of AGUIRRE and FITZCARRALDO as well as Mick Jagger's performance in the role of Fitzcarraldo before Jason Robards's illness stopped the production.

1099758,5,6305970955,"In this movie, Werner Herzog tells us about his experience in working with Klaus Kinski. Together they have made some fantastic movies, but Kinski was an incredibly difficult person to work with. He often got mad and shouted for hours if he got annoyed by anything. He could get so mad Herzog almost wanted to kill him at one point. But he is also described as a very warm person. Herzog describes this complicated love/hate relationship in this movie and some actors, actresses and film team members tell us about their experience in working with Kinski. It is a very interesting movie if you like Kinski, Herzog or if you have seen any of their movies. This is one of the best documentaries I've seen.",984960000,4,703,4.632
1099759,5,6305970955,"I rejoiced when ""Fitzcarraldo"" and ""Aguirre"" were released on DVD.  ""My Best Friend"" completes this remarkable story. From the moment I first saw the work of Herzog and Kinski on the screen, I was absolutlely mesmerized.  Their madness and genius were kindling for some of the finest films made.
Years ago, my wife and I were outside of a small hotel in Paris.  Certainly not the Ritz, but on the street was a white convertible Rolls Royce with Rome plates.  Beside it, I was stunned and transfixed to see Klaus Kinski.  We did not approach him because we respected his privacy. Still, from a distance we felt the energy and passion.  His charisma and presence were undeniable, even on a quiet Parisian street.
Klaus Kinski died alone in Marin County, California, part of the San Francisco Bay Area, not very far from my home.  I presume I should say, ""Rest in peace, Klaus"".  But that cliche would represent the antithesis of his life's work.",975110400,7,943,4.7073170731707314
1099760,5,6305970955,"From the moment the documentary ""My Best Fiend"" begins, you are shocked by the sight of Klaus Kinski in a live performance piece, assuming the guise of an iconoclastic Jesus Christ, who proceeds to berate, denounce and even physically challange members of the audience. It sets the tone for what is to come.  Director Werner Herzog reveals their fascinating working relationship in which he manipulated Kinski's madness for the camera.  Their collaboration resulted in such great movies as ""Aguirre, The Wrath of God,"" and ""Fitzcarraldo."" The fights and catastrophes that occured during both of these movie shoots on the Amazon brought great performances from Kinski, demonstrating that art can be the result of two artists at war with each other.  The DVD offers the option of hearing Werner Herzog's narration in German or English.",973296000,9,833,5.201492537313433
1099761,5,6305970955,"German film director Werner Herzog and the late international film star, Klaus Kinski, had a deep love-hate relationship with one another.  As artists, this fueled their work together and they will both be remembered primarily for their joint film efforts.  Indeed, throughout the documentary made by Herzog, the one still alive, he seems to be lacking half of himself when he is onscreen.  He also seems to be as much trying to reclaim the best parts of himself as much as he is trying to come to final terms with his relationship with Kinski.  Unfortunately, those best parts probably died with Kinski.  Each man believed the other one was mad and a megalomaniac.  Certainly neither man was like a ""normal"" person if you recall their film work together, all of it superb but obsessed.

Every time Kinski's face comes onto the screen in the documentary, I remembered how beautiful or ugly he could make himself appear.  His face is one artists everywhere would love to paint, draw, sculpt... whatever.  That people were drawn to him and repelled by him off-camera, in equal measure, should really come as no surprise. That he could embody both characteristics within seconds of one another before the camera defined his brilliance as an actor.  I think Kinski got the better end of the deal.  He lived life exactly under his own terms for 56 years and then died, apparently of natural causes, totally spent.  It was probably like a regular person's living to be 100!  Herzog, however, is left to go on and it is clear that he is not the artist he once was without his muse, his best fiend, Kinski.  This was an absolutely fascinating film and I highly recommend it.

Although this delves mostly into the making of  ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God"" and ""Fitzcaraldo"", you  needn't know a thing about those two brilliant films to love this one.  However, after you see this I guarantee you will seek out every film made  by both of these tremendously gifted men (don't bother with Kinski's  ""Creature"").
Sure, the relationship between Herzog and Kinski  has always been notorious and well documented, but not from the horses  mouth, and not with all these wonderful behind the scenes glimpses into the  thoughts of co-stars, extra's and production people. There are some amazing  and unforgettable things you will never know about these films and these  people without seeing this.
It is not simply the recorded rants of a  madman and his egocentric director, but a touching, scary and very deep  look into the hearts and minds of two cinema giants who will be studied,  disected and forever remembered.
If you've never seen the work of these  men before, start here and see why you should and will want to see it all -  More than once.

1099764,3,6305970955,"Now, i'm as big a Herzog and Kinski lover as you are likely to find, so i expected much from this documentary. Not that i wanted the Kinski myth to  be broken down, or have some great revelations about him as a human being,  actor, madman, i just wanted a little more than Herzog delivers. While i  like that it doesnt try to define Kinski and accepts the fact that he was  undefinable, many things to many people, i found this look back to be a  little lacking, a tad flat in presentation. A documentary about a force of  nature like Kinski should at least electrify or fascinate like the subject  did in his life. Instead, the movie is just a retread of what we have  already heard a hundred times before- insane, gentle, genius, self  absorbed, dangerous, caring. Maybe Kinski was such a puzzle of a man, it  became impossible to nail down a mood for the film. The film  doesnt have  any luster or kick and ends up a welcome companion peice to the grand  Kinski myth, just, not a particularly thrilling one.",964483200,8,1010,4.394594594594595

This was the relationship  between 2 cinema heroes of mine.  Werner Herzog has created an homage to  his friend, Klaus Kinski, with My Best Fiend.  The stories are amazing and  often hilarious, as Herzog recounts the lifetime of ""friendship""  with a man he so many times threatened (and plotted) to kill.
Even if  you're not a fan of either man or their work, check this film out for the  stories told.  I headed directly from the theater to a phone, to catch up  with some of my old best friends I hadn't spoken to in years.",963100800,7,695,4.317829457364341
1099962,5,6305970955,"Just watched the documentary KLAUS KINSKI: MY BEST FRIEND by Werner Herzog. He directed Kinski in 5 movies, the best known are perhaps AGUIRRE the WRATH of GOD & FTZCARRALDO although the others are known also. Highly recommended as it covers a very complex personality & skips over nothing on either end of this actor's personae. Lots of actual film footage & some you wouldn't expect to see from off camera.

A good portion of Herzog's personality is revealed also. Kinski had the best face in cinema for the expression of desire, sensuality, radiant happiness, anger, madness & complete maniacal devotion to a thought or purpose. Herzog reveals & lays bare the soul of this man who he knew, loved, hated & loved again well. The final shots are perhaps the most revealing of all. I found it to be a tremendous achievement until I remembered it was done by Werner Herzog , that is normal for this great director & documentarian.",1320278400,,928,4.728395061728395
1099963,5,6305970955,"Hilarious. Herzog speaks quietly, confidentially of Kinski, as though afraid of waking him up. His descriptions of Kinsky's insanity are so eloquent that one wonders who was harder to work with, Kinski or Bruno S., the mentally disabled star of THE ENIGMA OF KASPAR HAUSER.

My favorite anecdote is the one about Kinsky haranguing Herzog for hours, until Herzog goes into his tent, brings out his last piece of chocolate, and eats it in front of Kinsky. This silences Kinski.

The delightful final image, Kinski with a butterfly on his finger, transferring the butterfly to his shoulder, his shirt, his nose, smiling triumphantly in his knowledge that the butterfly isn't afraid of him. As though we were wrong about him all these years...",1248912000,2,739,5.0
1099964,3,6305970955,"Here's what Klaus Kinski wrote about Werner Herzog in his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/autobiography/dp/0140255362/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">autobiography</a>:

""Herzog is a miserable, spiteful, envious, stingy, stinking, money-hungry, malicious, sadistic, insidious, backstabbing, blackmailing, cowardly person, and a liar through and through. His so-called talent is nothing more than torturing helpless creatures and, if necessary, putting them to death or simply murdering them. No one and nothing interests him but his lousy career as a so-called filmmaker. Driven by a pathological addiction to cause a sensation, he himself provokes the most senseless difficulties and dangers and puts the safety and even the lives of others on the line -- only so he can later say that he, Herzog, achieved the seemingly impossible."" (This goes on for pages.)

Herzog mentions these passages in ""My Best Fiend,"" holds up a copy of Kinski's book, and says that he ought to read from it...but he never does. Instead, Herzog says that, actually, he ghost-wrote those hate-filled passages for Kinski (zing!). But he never quotes them. It is telling.

Things like this happen all the time throughout the film. I don't mind that Herzog focuses on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/five-films/dp/B00005YKXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">five films</a>&nbsp;he made with Kinski -- those are Kinski's most famous performances, and Herzog would know more about them than anyone else. But, for instance, toward the end of his life, Kinski was obsessed with making a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/film/dp/B000N19606/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">film</a>&nbsp;about the famous violinist Paganini, with whom he personally identified. Eventually he was able to make it, but it was the only film he ever directed, and the last film he ever acted in. Herzog mentions it in ""My Best Fiend,"" but he doesn't show any excerpts from it. All he says about it is that the script was unfilmable, and that Kinski had already exhausted himself by that point.

I am perfectly willing to suppose that Herzog is right, and that ""Paganini"" is a bad film. In fact I'm sure that's the case -- Kinski had no directorial experience, plus his notorious lack of restraint probably wouldn't translate into good directing. Also, it's clear from Kinski's autobiography that Kinski's interest in Paganini was driven by a badly-concealed desire to exalt himself. (You can see this in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cobra-Verde/dp/6305972796/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cobra Verde</a>"" too, although that's a brilliant film.) But still. ""Paganini"" was Kinski's only directorial effort, and he certainly put a lot of time and emotion into it. Whatever its ultimate artistic merit, clearly this project was extremely important to Kinski, and surely any attempt to understand him should at least briefly look at it. Maybe Herzog could even show an example of why it was such a bad film, and thereby make a larger point about why Kinski was unable to harness his own talents by himself. But he doesn't. Why? It's certainly not because he couldn't get the rights to it -- if he could find that obscure footage of Kinski's ""Jesus"" performance, he could surely get a clip from ""Paganini,"" a failure that no one wanted to distribute for years. But he doesn't forget to mention that Kinski allegedly asked him to direct ""Paganini,"" and that he refused. Hmm.

Herzog also visits a photographer who took many pictures of Kinski on set. This scene feels like mutual back-slapping, rather than a discussion of Kinski. Sure, they explain Kinski's ability to manoeuvre in front of the camera during the filming of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aguirre/dp/6305972761/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aguirre</a>,"" but most of the time, the conversation goes along the lines of, ""Oh Werner, it was hard work, but you did it."" ""Oh yes, I did, and you have the proof."" ""Yes, that was your role and you did it with bravado."" ""Oh, yes, it sure was."" Then Kinski is shown throwing a tantrum on the set of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fitzcarraldo/dp/B00001ODHV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fitzcarraldo</a>.""

There are scattered tidbits about Kinski's acting style, and a couple of clips, mostly from Herzog's films. There's one non-Herzog clip of Kinski playing a cruel military officer that illustrates how he could use subtle realism to strengthen his ""demonic"" roles. But that's all: for instance, there's nothing from Kinski's brief appearance in ""Doctor Zhivago,"" the only watchable scene in that otherwise dreadful film. On the plus side, there are a couple of interviews with Kinski's fellow actors. Eva Mattes and Claudia Cardinale both found Kinski to be a sweet and considerate man. Eva Mattes says so many nice things about Kinski that Herzog hurries to turn the conversation back to himself.

Watching this film, I thought that the Herzog/Kinski feud never ended, and that the real purpose of the film is to define Kinski's legacy entirely in Herzog's terms. The tone Herzog chooses for his anecdotes is exactly the tone that would discredit Kinski most. Instead of reading from Kinski's book, Herzog remarks, with all the good humour in the world, that all the abuse therein was actually Herzog's own idea. This remark is brilliantly unanswerable -- if you believe it, there's simply no way to take Kinski seriously anymore. Herzog's numerous remarks about Kinski's ""posing"" and ""insipid beliefs"" are in a similar vein. Herzog casually says that he showed Kinski how to act in many scenes, and that he could have played the parts himself. The film also reproduces Herzog's rant about the jungle from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Burden-of-Dreams/dp/B0007WFYB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Burden of Dreams</a>,"" even though it has nothing to do with Kinski. Sure, Herzog praises Kinski's talent, but he leaves no doubt as to who the real master was.

I can understand if Herzog wanted to even the score, after all the things Kinski said about him over the years. But in some sense, Kinski's hatred was boyishly naive compared to this film. Looking at Herzog's genial smile in ""My Best Fiend,"" you wonder whether Kinski might have been on to something in his description of Herzog. If you are interested in Kinski, read the autobiography. It's just as unreliable as a source of facts, but it reveals more of his character.",1244246400,13,6650,5.723684210526316
1099965,5,6305970955,"MY BEST FIEND is director Werner Herzog's love letter to his long time star and ocasional friend, German actor Klaus Kinski. Herzog and Kinski were two distinctly different personalities who often clashed, but when they came together they formed a third entity capable of creating incredible cinematic experiences. Kinski was brash, bombastic and given to horrendous rants and tantrums that kept most directors from working with him more than once--a completely egocentric artist who demanded being the center of attention at all times. Herzog by comparison is quiet and self-controlled, but he talks matter of factly of having planned to kill Kinski, and one piece of film shot on location shows him more than willing to go toe to toe with Kinski in a screaming match. But there is definitely a large ego at work in Herzog as well. So different and yet so much alike. A little madness and a lot of ego in them both.

Herzog seems frequently drawn to films that deal with madness, from AGUIRRE THE WRATH OF GOD, which starred Kinski, to his documentary GRIZZLY MAN about Timothy Treadwell who mistakenly believed his knowledge of the bears would protect him. However he also seems drawn to another type of film akin to the mockumentary. The best example being INCIDENT AT LOCH NESS where he supposedly records an expedition researching the famous monster, but is everything what it seems to be? I think that perhaps MY BEST FIEND is a happy marriage of these two cinematic preoccupations of Herzog's, because in MY BEST FIEND there's truth and there's some deception with a big wink. Even the film's title seems to be a hint that there is more here than meets the eye; A deception perhaps aimed at adding to the legendary relationship that existed between the two men during Kinski's lifetime which will probably grow to epic proportions now that he's gone-- something that I'm certain Kinski would enjoy immensely and approve of completely.",1243814400,,1941,4.9176829268292686
1099966,5,6305970955,"Herzog's films, with their dark visions and horrendously misanthropic dregs of society, are a cut above the rest.  They are deep art films that explore the extremes of human depravity:  megalomania, superhuman effort (for questionable causes), insanity, loss of self, murder.  He is like a raw, sharper-edged Bergman, whose country's fascist legacy has given him a perspective on horror and nihilism unavailable elsewhere, at least in art.  His greatest performer was, of course, Klaus Kinski.

This is an amazing film of how these two talents met and collaborated and fought, riffing off eachother until exhaustion and then making outstanding performances.  If you could say there is genius in cinema, these two would certainly qualify.  What emerges is an intimate portrait of both, from Herzog's point of view.  They had roomed in the same house when younger, and Herzog's observations of him practicing - up to 10 hours a day - convinced him to go into cinema.

Kinski comes off as one of Herzog's characters:  obsessed with perfection, focused in the manaical way that one would expect of a genius, he lived for his roles.  Here you witness what went into his performances, as managed by a great director.  The only thing that convinces you that KK was not completely insane was that he was so good on the set:  his point of view improved the quality whenever he offered ideas, his performances were perfection, even as he aggravated everyone around him.  That he was an egomaniac who became enraged if was not the center of attention is something we can all be glad we didn't experience.  Even Herzog admits that he planned to murder KK at one point. His native actors also had asked Herzog if he wanted them to kill Kinski.

By the end of this documentary, I viewed them as symbiotic, both of them were the characters in the films.  It is a wonderful juxtaposition, with Herzog seeming to realize it at the end, commenting that he is in fact Fitzcarraldo.

The title is curious.  While ""fiend"" sound like Feind, it is an inaccurate translation - it more exactly means ""enemy"".  There is a lot in the German that is poorly translated, in my hearing.

Warmly recommended.  This is a classic on creative collaboration and the total obsession that achieves the best, which is genius.",1240272000,,2286,4.852713178294573
1099967,4,6305970955,"Absolutely hilarious... Though you do wish the documentary was a bit more balanced. Kinski may well have been the ultimate nightmare actor, but director Herzog drove his crews and actors to extremes that would drive anyone crazy. Still this is a surprisingly  fun documentary about an egotistical actor, who inspired even the most gentle, simple tribal people who met him (during the filming of Fitzcaraldo and Aguirre: Wrath of God) to kill him.  Would make a great triple bill with the documentaries of the productions of Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" and Gilliam's ill-fated Don Quixote project.",1225411200,,595,5.252631578947368
1099968,4,6305970955,"Werner Herzog's 1999 documentary, Klaus Kinski: My Best Fiend, is yet another in the dazzling array of Herzog documentary, or documentary-like, films. This one follows his turbulent friendship and creative partnership with the legendary German actor Klaus Kinski. Herzog also serves as narrator, in German (with English subtitles, or dubbed into English). In the 1970s and 1980s the pair collaborated to make five indelibly memorable great films: Aguirre: The Wrath Of God (1972), Nosferatu: Phantom Of The Night (1979), Woyzek (1979), Fitzcarraldo (1982), and Cobra Verde (1988).
  In a sense, this film is pure hagiography, only in wink and a nod reverse, as Herzog proudly cements Kinski's reputation as the madman of 20th Century film; but in the hands of any other director that's all this film would be, schmaltzy hagiography. In the capable hands of Herzog, this film is a memorable experience in its own right.... The film also has other unexpected moments of fun and pleasure, including bizarre outtakes from a supposed earlier version of Fitzcarraldo, starring Jason Robards as Fitzcarraldo, with a goofy Mick Jagger as his even odder sidekick. Whether or not this is true footage, or was merely done as a gag, is left to the viewer's imagination, but it's hard to imagine that Herzog would have ever wanted to make such a film.
  Kinski died in 1991, in Marin County, California, at the age of sixty-five, just three years after his last collaboration with Herzog on Cobra Verde, yet Herzog seems to never have gotten over it, for the better or the worse. The whole film, despite its mockery and offbeat tone, is a most loving tribute of one artist to another, even as Herzog claims, `'Every gray hair on my head I call Kinski.' Yet, the two men and artists seemed to bring out the best in each other, for Kinski's career long predated Herzog's, and included small roles in epics like Doctor Zhivago, but no one today recalls a single role of Kinski's outside the Herzog milieu. That, alone, sums up why this documentary is a must see for Herzog fans, and fans of cinema.",1221350400,,2082,4.889518413597734
1099969,5,6305970955,"Werner Herzog, one of the greatest directors of our time, and Klaus Kinski, one of its greatest actors, collaborated with one another in five films.  Both were geniuses, both stubbornly protective of their artistic integrity, and both slightly egomaniac (actually, more than ""slightly"").  This documentary, made by Herzog, is an effort on his part, after Kinski's death, to make sense of their relationship.

Herzog's conclusion is that they complemented and genuinely liked one another, although it's also the case that each of them experienced episodes of great rage and hatred for one another.  In fact, both admitted to wanting to kill the other at times.  But together they managed to make some of the greatest films of the century.

Kinski comes across as an absolutely fascinating character:  possessed of a hair trigger and ferocious temper that could explode unexpectedly, he was the terror of camera crews, fellow actors, and sometimes Herzog himself.  Curiously, Herzog first met Kinski when Kinski was a struggling young actor and Herzog a boy of fifteen.  Kinski stayed in Herzog's mother's boarding house in Munich.  Even then his temper was apparent.  On one occasion he shut himself up in a bathroom for 48 hours, ranting, raving, and destroying until, as Herzog says, every piece of porcelain in the bathroom was so shattered that you could filter it through a tennis racket.

Although in the middle of wild nature (South America and Africa) for three of Herzog's films, and although he liked to say how much of a ""natural man"" he was, Kinski in fact feared and disliked nature.  He had a germ phobia, which caused him to dislike both human contact and the messiness of the jungle.  He was a terrible bully, but like most bullies was also a bit of a coward.

But the film isn't uniformly critical of Kinski, as an earlier reviewer says.  In fact, it's an honest and fascinating look at the wellspring of his genius.  Herzog speculates several times that the intense temper tantrums were Kinski's way of purging himself before he went before the camera--a way of emptying his mind and spirit to enter fully into the moment once in character.

Well worth watching, both for Herzog and Kinski fans, and those interested in artistic genius.",1214956800,,2253,4.946808510638298
1099970,5,6305970955,"Astounding documentary captures this unusually temperamental pairing of two big talents, who both needed, and couldn't stand, each other. We see this from Herzog's side (Kinski had died several years before), but the rendering doesn't feel one-sided or cruel. Below all the mutual frustration and rage lies a core of mutual respect, even tenderness. A remarkable portrait that illustrates the extremes and dichotomies of human relationships.",1184284800,,441,5.696969696969697
1100111,4,6305970955,"The documentary made by Werner Herzog tells about the legendary love-hate relationship between the director who was ready to climb to Hell for his every movie and border-line insane genius actor Klaus Kinski who might have been one of the creatures from Hell that Herzog had to face. It is hard to imagine two people more different than Herzog and Kinski: ""...stone and waves, the coldest ice and hottest flames have more in common, differ less"" but they both were driven and obsessed artists. Famous for his wild and ferocious talent and temperament to match, Kinski was incredibly difficult to work with. He wrote about himself, ""I am a wild animal born in captivity, in a zoo but where beast would have claws, I have talent"". Kinski's talent was fully realized in five films that he made with Werner Herzog over a fifteen-year working period, starting with astounding ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God"" (1973), and then following with ""Fitzcarraldo,"" ""Nosferatu"" (1979), inspired by Murnau's silent vampire classic; ""Woyzeck"" (1979), about a 19th century army private who seems mad to others because he looks and acts so differently from them, and ""Cobra Verde"" (1988). It is impossible to imagine any other actor starring in these films and they are without doubt the best Kinski ever made (and he made hundreds of films). Thanks to the Herzog's documentary we are able to learn what exactly went on behind the stunning images and unforgettable performances. According to Herzog, ""people like Marlon Brando are just kindergarden comparing to Kinski. He is mad and unpredictable."" They liked each other, they hated each other, and they respected each other at the same time making plans to murder each other. Kinski, who respected Herzog, and valued his friendship, confessed to the director that in his autobiography he would describe their relationship in not very flattering terms - otherwise, the crowd would not read it. Herzog recalls how they both would sit together at the bench after the shooting and discuss what Kinski would write in his book. I am curious if they discussed and agreed upon the following passage and if Herzog helped Kinski with some of the colorful metaphors: ""I absolutely despise this murderous Herzog! Huge red ants should p**s into his lying eyes, gobble up his balls, penetrate his a**hole and eat his guts.""

Even after watching the fascinating documentary, it is difficult to fully understand the relationship between two giants but as Herzog admits, the only thing that counts is what we see on the screen and what we see is amazing.",1172793600,2,2566,4.9953271028037385
1100112,4,6305970955,"Far from being a character assissination & chop job on Kinski (as some reviewers would claim), Herzog's film is as much as an examination of his own obssessive drive and (albeit, much lower key) madness as it is a look back at his relationship with one of the most (by general consensus) difficult & brilliant actors in the business.

Obviously, Herzog regards Kinski as being a nut...but he all but concedes that one would have to be crazy in one's own right to continue to work with such a man, again & again.  It would be nice if Herzog would discuss, in a less oblique fashion, his own driving commitment (as evidenced in ""Aguirre"" and ""Fitzcarraldo"") which helped to cause this clash of megalomaniacs, but nonetheless, the examination is there for those discerning viewers who choose to see it.

Yes, it would be nice if Kinski could have returned fire, so to speak.  It also would have been less frustrating if Herzog had discussed the reasons that he finally decided to end their collaboration after ""Cobra Verde.""  However, in the end, we have to be satisfied with what we got.  It is a fascinating little slice of film history worth watching.",1172448000,3,1151,4.701492537313433
1100113,5,6305970955,"This above quote from Werner Herzog may shock a lot of film buffs, but it goes to show you just how extraordinary of an actor Klaus Kinski was.  'Kinski: My Best Fiend' is a eye-opening and touching look at two visionary artists.  The German director Werner Herzog looks back on his experiences with Klaus Kinski.  From the time Herzog was 13 years old, when he first met Kinski, to the time of the filming of their last film together, 'Cobra Verde', this documentary is often as haunting and eerie as Herzog's films themselves.  They both had a love-hate relationship that carried on until Kinski's death.  At the same time, both artist were in awe of each other.  Both realized they had exceptional talent and knew they could not create meaningful, artistic work without each other.",1132704000,5,784,4.770370370370371
1100114,5,6305970955,"A grandly entertaining documentary that manages to be savagely funny, nail-bitingly harrowing and oddly moving all at once. Director Werner Herzog does a bit of self-absorbed navel-gazing and a lot of tall tale-spinning in this retrospective of his love-hate artistic partnership with actor Klaus Kinski (Urban legend puts both men literally plotting the other's murder at one time or another). Of course, we all know that ""dead men tell no tales"", (uh-Kinski did die of natural causes, far as we know) so we have to acknowledge the point-of-view as a bit lopsided from the outset; although to his credit Herzog does consult a couple of Kinski's leading ladies, who seem more willing to recall examples of Kinski's kinder, gentler (and lucid) moments (Most backstage footage of Kinski included shows the actor in ""screaming tantrum"" mode, which can paint a somewhat one-dimensional portrait.) As some reviewers have said, it does help if you have previously viewed the pair's more mercurial collaborations first, namely ""Fitzcarraldo"" and ""Aguirre, The Wrath Of God"", as both projects mirror the pathos and bathos of the real life relationship. Ultimately, the film begs the question: Are any great artists ever ""normal"" people anyway? From Mozart to Brando, history seems to bear out that when it comes to the creative arts, there is frequently a fine line between ""being a genius"" and ""needing to be locked up"". Final scene is an unexpectedly loving and beautiful coda which brought tears to this viewer's eyes. Essential viewing for fans of the director and his muse.",1111968000,6,1570,5.1607843137254905
1100115,5,6305970955,"I feel as though my life would have been incomplete had I never seen this movie.  Klaus's lunacy fueled by Werner's meth amphetamine dependency are a recipe for unprecedented hilarity and hijinx.  I could not stop laughing from the first frame to the inspired rolling of the credits (which in and of themselves should have received an oscar nomination for art direction.)  As a matter of fact, I have not been able to stop laughing since I saw this film (and I last saw this film 8 years ago.)  Bully!!! to Werner who has created an unparalleled portrait of a lunatic and his love of romantic literature. If you watch the beginning of this movie and are not convinced by Klaus's portrayal of Jesus that in fact KLAUS IS THE CHRIST then I think you would not be my choice for participating in an Algerian War of Independence reenactment.  More's the pity, or as Klaus would say ""f$ck off with your silly stupid ugly faces of nonchalance.""  Genius.",1102809600,9,946,4.601190476190476
1100116,4,6305970955,"The title's play on words pretty much sums up the sentiment of the film.  Herzog's depiction of his relationship with Kinski is painfully honest, but it is not hard to see the affection mingled with the frustration.  Kinski was a mad man and nearly impossible to work with.  And yet Herzog chose to work with him again and again, and with great results.  This film is a tribute to their contentious and productive relationship.
There are some really funny stories here, including one where Herzog actually threatened to kill Kinski.  Some may have heard of this spat, but it is still interesting to hear Herzog's dead-pan account.
Very honest, very informative, very entertaining documentary about a very complex relationship.  It goes beyond friendship.  It just had to be, whether either of them wanted it or not.",1083196800,2,815,4.948529411764706
1100117,5,6305970955,"I first recommend that a viewer rent Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes and Fitzcarraldo before viewing this documentary.  To undestand the importance of this collaboration it is necessary to first see the films that it produced.
Herzog revisits the locations near Macchu Pichu where artistic passions blossomed into homicidal rage in the crucible of the Peruvian rainforest.
Herzog is fascinated by notions of human madness, obsession, and conciousness.  This theme is the focus of most of his films.  In Fitzcarraldo, the madness leads to incredible triumph and success, in Aguirre it leads to revolt, death, and utter chaos.  What is most important to note is that in both instances is that the madness of the dominant individual, whether Fitz or Aguirre, is an intoxicating charisma that conforms a following to the individual's will.  This is Kinski's obsession even when the cameras aren't rolling, and it is this passion that attracts Herzog's interest, an interest perhaps tied to his childhood in post-Third Reich Germany.  Perhaps Herzog underestimated Kinski's persuasive rage that nearly turned Herzog's jungle endeavors into Pizzarro's folly.",1073865600,,1145,5.440677966101695
1100118,5,6305970955,"I detect a strong streak of playful embellishment in Herzog's accounts of Klaus Kinski's childishness and egomaniacal behavior. Perhaps that's because the first time I saw Werner Herzog in front of a camera was in his own acting role in Harmony Korine's bizarre film Julien Donkey-boy, in which Herzog's ample talents for script-less bullsh*tting were showcased. In My Best Fiend, I again sense similar moments of ad-libbed fabrication while listening to Herzog's various outlandish and defaming Kinski anecdotes. Not that Herzog's penchant for hyperbole detracts from the enjoyment of the film or from the mythic proportions of his collaboration with Kinski. But, if one considers this film alongside the deprecating rendering of Herzog contained in Kinski's autobiography, one begins to suspect a mutually-mischievous game of smearing one another publicly --just a twisted sense of humor shared by two close friends. With this gonzo-documentary, Herzog prevails eternally with a post-mortem vilification of his long-time friend and artistic co-conspirator.
No doubt, Kinski was a nut. But probably more in the vein of Andy Kaufman than Caligula Caesar. The film clips from Kinski's ""Jesus Speech"" stage shows, documenting his unshakable adherence to character and his tantrums directed at the audience, remind me a lot of Kaufman on the pro-wrestling circuit. There's also clearly a good deal of acting involved in Kinski's other ostensibly spontaneous rages caught on film. Particularly, the footage of the actor raving maniacally on the set of Fitzcarraldo struck me as a complete put-on. It seemed almost to have been an elaborate anthropology experiment designed to observe the native tribal people's reaction to mental illness. The Indians were clearly impressed with the film crew's calm handling of the ""situation"", though it's telling --if Herzog is to be believed-- that they later offered to kill the madman for him. It occurred to me while watching this ""behind-the-scenes"" account that the entire filming of Fitzcarraldo could be regarded as such an experiment.

Herzog alludes to Kinski's womanizing prowess in deadpan comedic fashion. As he introduces one of Kinski's former leading-lady co-stars, Herzog jabs that she was the only one to say anything nice about him. The interview that follows is peppered liberally with oblique sexual insinuation.
At one point in the film, as a contemplative Herzog sits on a train (while revisiting filming locations in South America), there is a voice-over of Kinski ranting, presumably taken from one of the ""Jesus Speech"" shows. The subtitles indicate that Kinski is detailing the hideous fate that awaits those who commit the egregious sin of slander. How wonderfully poetic, considering the nature of this film: Herzog uses Kinski's own words to mockingly taunt him in his grave!
Perhaps the strangest part of this movie is the outtake from Fitzcarraldo, filmed before Kinski had replaced Jason Robards as the lead, complete with Mick Jagger as the goofy sidekick! Unreal. Could that be a put-on too? I really don't know what to believe anymore!",1062633600,19,3103,5.371663244353183
1100119,5,6305970955,"There probably could never be anybody capable of making a documentary about Klaus Kinski other than Werner Herzog. After all, as the title emplies, Kinski was Herzog's best fiend. This is an endlessly fascinating portrait of an actor who was a genius, a madman and a tender soul. Herzog creates a rich film here that never bores. He doesn't turn it into a mournful memory where he might just sit in a chair and talk to a camera, no, he takes us to the locations where he and Kinski filmed, travels to visit crew members and friends and shows us unique behind the scenes footage. The beginning is shocking but intuitive, as Kinski gets into heated arguments with audience members during a performance as Jesus Christ. And if you look at it, shouldn't this be the way hecklers should be handled anyway? Kinski remains a fascinating figure through-out, a brilliant actor who could perfectly become a character and take over the screen. Herzog is a mad genius too and so his portrait of his best friend is really filled with depth and even touching at times. We see them filming in the harsh conditions they went up against to make the masterpieces ""Aguirre, The Wrath Of God"" and ""Fitzcarraldo."" We see Kinski and his famous tantrums as he chews out crew members and Herzog in truly violent-mouthed ways.... It is always interesting to hear Herzog talk about the making of the movies and there stunning vistas, like the amazon and Andes where the two mentioned films were made (we see the stunning sequence from the beginning of ""Aguirre"" where we see hundreds of Spanish conquistadors look like ants as they walk down an Andean slope). One thing the movie should be valued for is that Herzog does not only show the dark, crazy side of Kinski, he also shows the nice side. The last shot is truly memorable where Kinski is gently playing with a butterfly and we see his gentle, tender side. The movie is also comic, especially when we see two brilliant artists battle it out. It's funny to see that Kinski and Herzog loved and loathed each-other equally. ""My Best Fiend"" is a must for movie buffs, fans of Herzog or Kinski, and for anybody who is fascinated by films that explore unique minds. It is a fascinating, memorable piece of work.",1010275200,6,2235,4.660759493670886
