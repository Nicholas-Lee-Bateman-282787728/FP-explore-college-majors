8266982,4,B0017RLT14,"I had heard about this video in a blog post where readers were asked to suggest the writing resources that had helped them most. This was one of the many suggestions in that post.  I'm glad I splurged for the video.

Although this video is aimed primarily at screenwriters (movie, television), as a novelist and short story writer I found it very useful.  Pilar Alessandra is a pleasure to watch, as she walks you through brainstorming a story by character, event, or otherwise.  She explains story structure well, and gave a great explanation of why it can make a difference where an event happens in a story.  For example, moving it closer to the start of the story means you're probably spending the rest of the story showing the aftermath of that event on characters' lives.

The production quality of the video is amateurish in places, and that's about the worst thing I can say about it.  Apart from that, it's a solid resources and something I got a lot out of.  I have incorporated things I learned from this video in my current writing and brainstorming process, which is as good a testament to it as I can give.",1464220800,,1121,4.57

8266984,5,B0017RLT14,"Great motivator and resource for getting started on your first script.  If you really want to write a script, give ""On The Page"" a try.  I just bought her (Pilar Alexandra's) book as well.",1414022400,,188,4.5
8266985,5,B0017RLT14,"Pilar Alessandra is the script teacher and she is really cool I think. I like her personality, she keeps things fun and asks some very helpful questions that I may not have thought to ask myself.

Personally I am a true beginner into scriptwriting thus I would categorize this as an almost intermediate DVD. You should already know about the 3 Act Structure and have done a lot of character development. Then I HIGHLY suggest using this DVD to take your script to the next level.

Pilar also does personal script consultations which I would like to do with her. Data for that is on her website.",1365724800,,594,4.542056074766355

8266989,5,B0017RLT14,"Before I used to get bogged down in structure, or just sitting down to write seemed to be a daunting task.  I followed the exercises (which take about 10 minutes and in no time I had an actual outline of my whole script. Ms. Alessandra also gives great exercises on characters dialogue and how to end a screenplay that are really useful.  A must have for any screenwriter!",1216166400,5,372,4.455882352941177
