8694448,4,B00R7SUSJG,"I absolutely love this series, I saw it on Netflix when it first came out, so I decided to purchase the DVD.... however, much to my dismay, I discovered that my DVD player would not play this DVD due to it being a British DVD, and not an American DVD. I am a bit disappointed, however have nothing but amazing things to say about this miniseries. Just make sure you are well aware if you are ordering this in the United States, it MIGHT not work.",1476921600,2,446,4.1976744186046515
