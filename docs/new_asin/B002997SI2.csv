Fortunately, I borrowed a copy from the library before buying it, so I'm off the hook. I would not buy this. I can't see how it really helps with a postpartum belly. There wasn't a lot of deep ab work. I'll stick with yoga and core exercises.",1407888000,,393,4.397260273972603

8357606,4,B002997SI2,"This video is well produced. The instructor & music are very soothing. It makes you feel as if you are not really exercising, although the routine does work up a sweat. It is mostly stretching with some gentle movement. She takes you through it step by step. I was fine until she stood on her head! Even the ""easy"" alternative involves standing on your head. You also need a long exercise band. I think an 8 foot long one would be good.",1292371200,3,436,4.329268292682927
