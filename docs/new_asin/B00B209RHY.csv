5552716,5,B00B209RHY,"I'm not a fan of live-action movies based off Animes. BUT, This is now in my top 10 favorite movies! The story line may be a little off, but that is no reason to critique such a masterpiece so harshly. This is by far not only a great movie, but one of the best Samurai movies i has laid my eyes upon and probably the best sword fighting I have seen in any movie. Period. If you are a Kenshin fan you will not be disappointed.",1361577600,10,425,3.953488372093023
5552717,5,B00B209RHY,"As a huge fan of the manga and anime, I absolutely loved this movie. I love how the writers wove a couple of storylines together, and am very grateful that they included Saito even though he's not supposed to come in until the Kyoto arc.

The actors are fantastic; truly the characters come to life. Takeru Sato as Kenshin perfectly embodies the gentle goofiness of the wanderer, and then switches to the deadly cold-blooded focus of the Battosai. It's seriously like he becomes a different person. My other favorite standout is Yosuke Eguchi as Saito. He is just SO Saito! In the battle of Toba Fushimi, when he's walking around slashing people while smoking a cigarette...so very Saito. But that is not to shortchange the other actors. They were all perfectly cast.

*****SPOILERS FOLLOW*****

The major arc of the storyline is the Kanryu Takeda arc, but with Aoshi and the Oniwaban replaced with Jin-ei, so those two stories are woven together. The introduction of Sanosuke is abbreviated, but still satisfying. Yahiko gets little screen time, which is just fine with me.

The problems I have with the movie are so picky they're hardly worth mentioning. Probably the most major one is that Kaoru seems more helpless than she should. Sure, she's still plucky and still fights, but she gets rescued a lot. Also, by leaving her out of the fight at Kanryu's mansion, it seems to emphasize that she's not an effective fighter. (I know she was left behind story-wise so she could be kidnapped by Jin-ei, but still.)

I also wish the fight between Kenshin and Saito could have been the full-blown fight from the beginning of the Kyoto arc, but I'm grateful that they had ANY fight scene since Saito shouldn't even be here. Plus, I understand that it was more dramatic then for Kenshin to become the Battosai at the end in his battle with Jin-ei.

I really enjoy the fight scenes, which do NOT seem to be full of CGI effects. I can't say which one was my favorite: the fight at the dojo, the fight outside Kanryu's mansion, or the final battle with Jin-ei. They've all required repeated viewings.

I've read that a sequel is in the works. I really hope it's the Kyoto arc, and that I get the Saito/Battosai fight I want so desperately. Also, PLEASE RELEASE IT IN NORTH AMERICA. I probably would have paid to see this movie about five times in the theater.",1361318400,39,2350,4.675544794188862
5552718,5,B00B209RHY,"I doubt anyone involved with the making of this movie will ever  read this, but as a long time fan of Samurai X and the Kenshin TV series I have to say I could only hope for a sequel. I want more cartoons and live action movies.

I have to admit I was afraid of a live action film but the talent behind this film left me with my jaw on the floor wanting more. It's everything a true Kenshin fan would want to see in a live action movie.
The story does cover the beginning of Samurai X with the beginning of the Kenshin TV series

This DVD is region free with English subtitles and it's awesome and you will love this movie. I wish they would have put some behind the scenes and extras on this. However, If they should ever do a rerelease or a sequel to  this movie you can simply count me in. I really wish that I could have seen it here in America on the big screen as it was being released in Japan. Awesome movie !",1361232000,4,917,3.967391304347826
5552719,5,B00B209RHY,What can I say.  This is my favorite anime and my favorite manga.  Anything about my beloved kenshin s just amazing.,1361232000,,116,4.476190476190476
5552720,5,B00B209RHY,"5 stars is exaggerating a bit.  I think that the long term life of a series of live action movies could have been better served by staying a little bit closer to the Anime or the Manga.  That said, they did a great job of keeping with the heart of the story and characters.  They packed a lot of story lines in as well.  As another bonus, there wasn't a painful amount of wire work in the action scenes.  In fact, I was surprised how little action there was in comparison to the story-line scenes (a good thing really).

For anyone that is waiting, not being sure if this title really has English subtitles, it does.  The translations seemed good to me (not speaking any Japanese) although there was some...interesting grammar.

All in all, this should be a no-brainer for any Kenshin fan.  The movie far exceeded my best expectations.",1359936000,41,835,4.513333333333334

5552722,5,B00B209RHY,"I wish there was a 10-star rating system for this trilogy.  I would give it a solid ten except for the cheesy subtitles.  Aside from that, I was blown away by plot line, character development, and utterly gorgeous production values.  This movie (includes all three) is NOTHING like the cartoon, which is also exceptional.  Don't hesitate to buy this title, but get the other two at the same time, because this story is addicting.",1454284800,,429,4.756756756756757

5552725,3,B00B209RHY,"In all honesty I love this movie it's very well made an really creative. Now for some negative feedback.
The sound quality is crap the subtitles are very cheaply done and inaccurate whoever did the subtitles was a amature and didn't know how to translate there were many typos
I don't speak alot of Japanese but I can understand enough to know what there saying on screen and what the subtitles say are different I don't even read the subtitles anymore.",1450915200,,453,4.604938271604938

5552727,5,B00B209RHY,Kenshin is a character that I've known while growing up so I really anticipated this live action and it did not disappoint me. This gave justice to my forever favorite Japanese anime. The actors are great! The stunts and all the samurai techniques were exactly as it was in the anime! I'll be watching this over and over again and never get tired of this film!,1432771200,,360,4.46969696969697
5552728,5,B00B209RHY,This is one if the greatest live action films I have ever seen. It stays very true to the original animation and isn't super cheesy.

5552734,5,B00B209RHY,"Let me just start by saying I LOVE Rurouni Kenshin as a Manga series, and I adore the anime series. I truly believe Kenshin and Kaoru are the ideal anime couple, despite their unconventional ""romance."" I have waited a long time for this film, and I was not disappointed by any means. The main characters were just great, and it did follow a little of both Rurouni Kenshin and Samurai X, which were both similar but not exactly the same. Fans of both will love this, as it does a great job of bringing to life the action scenes coveted from the series. It was fun watching what it would really look like to watch Kenshin wield his reversed blade sword. I am looking forward to purchasing the second part.",1425945600,,703,4.415384615384616
5552735,5,B00B209RHY,"I've watched the anime series since I was a kid so when I heard they were doing a live-action film I was a bit skeptical. It came out pretty good, though. I loved it and bought it; am planning on getting the two sequels as well!",1425772800,,228,3.9782608695652173
5552736,5,B00B209RHY,These movies are so well done. I should think any fan of the manga or anime can appreciate how close Sato Takeru gets to the Kenshin character. I will be buying all three when they are available.,1425340800,,195,4.297297297297297

5552740,5,B00B209RHY,"For a Live Action film. It was great! I admire how much a pain it had to have been to choose scenes from the Anime and sew them together for this film.. They nailed Kenshin's character, his mannerisms and actions are really nice to watch.. all the characters are really well picked.. could've done better on a few of the 'bad guys' but, meph! they're the bad guys so I guess who cares.  ^_^  It's definitely worth watching if you love Rurouni Kenshin!",1424044800,,451,4.421686746987952

5552743,5,B00B209RHY,I absolutely love this movie. If you are a Kenshin fan you will appreciate how they went about it. I have watched it over and over. There are a number of scenes where you can clearly see the swordsmanship caliber of Kenshin and it made the hair on my arms stand up. You know that in the anime everything looks really cool when Kenshin kicks butt. But to see it done by a person it's amazing. Effects are great and the actors do the anime justice. My favorite scene is the fight in the study (or library) when Kenshin seems to have ultra super speed in the last swipe of his blade which ends the fight. That was so amazing to see in live action. I cannot wait for to get #2 and #3 of this trilogy.,1419552000,,696,4.087591240875913

5552746,5,B00B209RHY,Not your typical Samurai movie.  I don't follow the manga but this movie had a lot of interesting and fun characters.  I liked the way the director word cut to a slow motion shot then back to normal motion.  This movie was a lot of fun and I really hope they make sequels.,1417910400,,272,4.09433962264151
5552747,1,B00B209RHY,"***Review is not of the movie but of this DVD.

As a big Rurouni Kenshin fan, I really wanted to see this movie, so when I saw this DVD for sale I went Yay and ordered it without closely reading the details. As soon as I opened the shipping box, I realized this is a bootleg (it's all-region, and the Chinese and Malaysian text on the cover were another clue). I don't give money to pirates, so I returned this, and I'm eagerly awaiting an officially licensed, legal release.",1416182400,2,475,4.337078651685394
5552748,5,B00B209RHY,"Great movie, I think they did really well following the first couple of arcs and blending it into one live action movie.  I felt that the actors they chose portrayed the characters extremely well, especially Kenshin and his way of speaking.  The action scenes were well choreographed, I loved the fighting scenes a lot! If you are a fan of this anime I don't think you will be disappointed at all.  I hope they continue to make more movies!",1416009600,,440,4.544303797468355

5552751,5,B00B209RHY,"This movie is surprisingly good. I had low expectations considering it's a live action anime film. I have to say, that minus one or two kinda corny fight scene/flying moments, it was actually a pretty solid film. I definitely recommend it to fans of the ""Samurai X"" OVA for Rurouni Kenshin.",1410220800,,290,4.705882352941177

5552758,5,B00B209RHY,"Wow!  This was a really fantastic version of the animae.  Sato Takeru does an excellent job of portraying Kenshin.  I always have my doubts when they turn animae into live action.  Some are good, some are ok and some are bad.  This was excellent.  One of my favorite animaes has come to life!",1407888000,,292,4.415094339622642
5552759,5,B00B209RHY,"Awesome. The wandering pacifist samurai in feudal Japan gets the live action film treatment. As someone who devoured Rurouni Kenshin in all its formats, I'm grateful that they more or less kept faith with the spirit of the shounen manga and the OVAs and the anime.

One hundred forty years ago, before manga and anime, during the chaotic unrest of the Tokugawa Shogunate, the cross-scarred assassin, Battousai the Manslayer (Takeru Sat), cut a bloody swathe in history. In January of 1868, in the mountains of Toba Fushimi, Kyoto, the final skirmish in the great upheaval was fought, and the Battousai slew his last man. He then drove his katana into the cold, hard ground and walked away, forsaking death and violence. But unbeknownst to the Battousai, his sword was taken up by another and thus his reputation of bloodshed lived on.

In 1878, the eleventh year of the Meiji, the era of Restoration leaves a sour taste for some. Money sways the most convincingly. In this time of peace, many samurai are unemployed and become penniless vagabonds. In Tokyo, Kaoru Kamiya (Emi Takei) diligently maintains her father's empty kendo dojo even as she looks to get even with his killer, the infamous Battousai the Manslayer. One day Kaoru mistakes a rurouni - a wanderer - for the assassin. She challenges him, never mind that he swings a non-lethal reverse-blade sword (blade's on the wrong side). It could've gotten really bad except the wanderer manages to save face for both of them. And that's been the way of it for the Battousai, now styling himself ""Kenshin Himura,"" seeking peace but ever finding bedevilment and violence.

With a running time of 138 minutes, it's still not enough room to cram in all that we want. The plot sort of folds in the first two arcs of both the manga and anime, but with the random heavy tweak (one example: the guy calling himself the new Battousai ISN'T a disgruntled student who was years ago expelled from Kaoru's father's dojo). I'm a bit bummed that Aoshi and his ninja clan were scrapped. But, at least, in their stead, we get awesome characters from the Jinchu arc. Mostly, it's a familiar beat: Guilt-ridden drug chemist Megumi Takani (Y Aoi) runs away from the opium drug lord Kanryuu Takeda (Teryuki Kagawa) and seeks sanctuary at Kaoru's dojo. It'll take the combined forces of Kenshin and the street brawler Sagara Sanosuke (Munetaka Aoki) to fend off the brutal advances of Kanryuu and his army of goons.

If you're a connoisseur of chambara cinema, then you're aware of how repetitive the sword fights tend to get. Gratifyingly, RUROUNI KENSHIN presents combat in steel that is fluid and innovative. The plot device of Kenshin's unshaken refusal to kill inspires sword fights that look so friggin' fresh as Kenshin resorts to creative, non-fatal swordplay to defeat his adversaries. Awesomely, practical effects are in play more so than CGI. There's minimal wirework applied, there only to reinforce the illusion that, yeah, the characters really can execute their moves in a damn blink or slide across the ground with inhuman grace. All of Kenshin's fights are highlight material but you have to give it up for the final two duels. And Kenshin's battou jutsu stance is epic!

You're asking about the tone of the film? Okay, it's not as consistently playful as the anime episodes. Kenshin is more steadily brooding. In a dark, defining moment, a flashback reveals how Kenshin gets the first scar across his cheek. But every now and then we catch glimpses of the cheerfully clueless persona he projects, including his ""Oro"" catchphrase. The interplay between Kenshin and Kaoru are frequently lighthearted. And there's Sanosuke who wields the antique, incredibly massive Zanbato blade and who doesn't seem to have a brooding bone in his body. The big bad, as played by Teryuki Kagawa, seems straight out of Looney Toons, guy's so camp and over-the-top. And yet there's enough menace in him that you sort of have to take him seriously.

I love that main actors are able to channel the core of what makes their characters distinct. There's enough character development. The film keeps several plates spinning, distractions that keep you invested, whether it's Kaoru's mission to redeem her father's good name or that scary assassin going around bumping off people and calling himself the Battousai. There's a melancholic undercurrent of ""the times they are a-changing,"" as the era of the Samurai gives way to modern progress (ie: western wardrobe and gatling guns). I've very few bones to pick with this movie. Kaoru comes across too much as a damsel-in-distress. The ""fight"" between Kenshin and Sanosuke is underwhelming. Saito is a throwaway character. And, yeah, the English sub-titles are abominable. But those are minor nitpicks, excepting the crap sub-titles which, admittedly, for some, could be a deal breaker. Considering how often I've been disappointed with live action adaptations of manga and anime classics, I count RUROUNI KENSHIN as full of win.",1407801600,2,5003,5.0
5552760,5,B00B209RHY,"The story of a young man with amazing skills with a sword, an infamous assassin, who decides to never kill again. Sort of like a gunfighter who puts down his guns but is still a target for the guys who want to be the one who kills the best. This story is simple and includes a number of odd aspects, such as a villain who is a kind of evil sorcerer whose motivations probably make more sense in Japanese culture. The hero uses a sword with a ""reversed blade"" the he cannot use easily to kill but makes it possible for him to bludgeon his opponents into submission and/or unconsciousness. The fights are remarkable but very fast, much like the real thing, so people used to slo-mo might have problems keeping up with the action. A lot of fun and a surprisingly sunny ending, considering this is a Japanese story. Well worth the money.
The DVD was flawless, which is always nice.",1407628800,,877,4.419753086419753

While the movie played just fine I was still upset to see it wasn't a real copy.

It is such a joy to see the characters I fell in love with transformed so impeccably into flesh. The action scenes are incredible, high paced and well choreographed. (Even the family members I watched this with who are not Kenshin savvy were wowing at some of the stuff they pulled of without obvious use of wires.)  It stays true to the fighting style of each character. The story plays out smoothly and keeps you intrigued.  Subtle changes to the story line did not defeat my enjoyment of this film.  I highly recommend this film to all Rurouni Kenshin fans as well as anyone who enjoys live action martial arts films.",1397260800,,735,4.545454545454546

You will get way more out of this if you have followed that manga/anime as they don't spell out everything and the little cute things about the chars seem insignificant if you don't know their personalities.  I loved the chars as they were true to the manga/anime, but this movie was different a little ...so your not sitting there expecting every single move, dialogue, and scene. But it does stay within the storyline, things just get introduced at different times. I was so delighted that Kenshin's speed, skill, and moves were able to be put into real life visual enjoyment WITHOUT BEING EXAGGERATED beyond believable that you lose the feel of the awesomeness that his char is.",1393200000,,704,4.770491803278689

Don't be fooled by the reviews! The people who rate this high forget they need to rate the seller NOT THE MOVIE.
The movie is indeed amazing. But you can tell this DVD is pirated.

When I first received this product, it was perfectly sealed, but when I opened it, there were scratches EVERYWHERE!!!! It was terrible! I knew it wasn't new! So I emailed them and complained. They said they would send me a new one. It took them 2 weeks to send it! I had to email them and then they sent me the information of the location. When I got this one, the package was open, but I didn't mine because I knew they checked it.

QUALITY:
This is a pirated DVD! They try to make it as legit as possible, but it isn't! The picture isn't sharp, but it is alright. The sound. IS A JOKE. The volume kept on going up and down, when the actors spoke, they raised the volume because it was hard to speak, but when it was background music time COVER YOUR EARS! Because at the beginning it is super loud, and you can tell they try to fix it.

In conclusion, it is an amazing movie. Would I buy it from them? I don't think so. I wish I read the negative reviews... Because those were the true reviews...
Buy it from someone else, or wait for it to legitly come out in the US",1392854400,9,1292,4.119047619047619

5552791,4,B00B209RHY,I'm a big Kenshin fan & just couldn't wait to get my hands on this movie. It was very good with all the familiar faces of the 1st season of the TV series. Of course the story has many differences from the TV series since it's a movie adaptation & would definitely would love to see a sequel to this movie. The only thing that I didn't like too much is how much they changed the other in which events take place compared to the series but I realize that it's never easy adapting a TV series to the big screen & things have to be changed in other to make it work. The fight with Kurogasa has to be my favorite scene & it resembles very closely how it happened in the series. This would complete my Kenshin DVD collection.,1391904000,,719,4.1063829787234045

Characters are being constantly peeled; that is, their natures, complexities, hang-ups are seen on many individual levels. This ain't your daddy's slice-and-slash samurai flicks.

Go see it, be surprised and impressed. To top it all off, the graphic design is
elegant, even to locations which were great, a Japan which I've never before seen.
Subtitled, but smartly brief. In all, one of the best produced new films to come
out of Japan.",1390521600,,613,5.191919191919192

If you are a fan, well there are some minor character issues...

Some characters don't exit.  You have Jin'e and Kauryu as your main two bad guys.  It spans the first season, so they probably wanted to consolidate who he has to fight.

The biggest disappointment is what they did with the oliwaban group.

They exist in some form or another, just not given names.  If you saw/read anything about kenshin you can see which ones are present...Aoishi and Hanya were combined into one chacter.  Obviously, the guy who blows fire isn't there...but the midget who is on his back usually is...at the beginning of the movie...hell even sounds like him.

Overall though, great movie, and I really hope they make a sequel which is a bit truer to the story.",1390089600,,840,4.546666666666667

The storyline was efficiently collapsed, the action sequences were well done and the actors portayed the essence of the manga characters in a believable fashion.  The English subtitling was a little off in places, but the story was tight enough to make it relatively easy to figure out what they were really trying to translate.

5552799,5,B00B209RHY,"I'd heard this was a really good adaptation, but I was still ""I hope, I hope"" while waiting for it to arrive, because sometimes people think things are good that I go ""....no"" at (or vice versa).

But, oh my god, it is so amazingly good that other anime-adapted-to-live-action movies/shows ought to strive to this level of awesome. It could not have been better cast, the special effects were surprisingly restrained and never once detracted from it, and the adaptation of the early storylines (Jin-e, Kanryu, and adding Sano, Megumi, and Yahiko to the main cast, which is the first... 10? 12? episodes of the anime) to movie format was nothing less than genius given format differences.

There were, I admit, some moments I missed, but the only real nitpick I have is that Gein's pistols had a truly magical number of bullets in them. (Gein = blond guy under the impressive mask, for anyone who didn't check cast list and/or doesn't remember.) And when that's the biggest complaint one has about a movie? Yeah.

Takeru Sato as Kenshin was especially good - from how he moves, the differences between battle-mode and everyday-mode, his dialogue (it made me absurdly happy every time he said ""Oro"", and when I realised that they kept his antiquated mode of speech--every ""de gozaru"" made me grin like an idiot (yes, I know it's so inherently part of his character that they'd have been dumb to take it out, but sometimes movie people make dumb choices like that)). I couldn't have pictured a better Kenshin.

I did miss Aoshi and the Oniwabanshuu (if you look at the cast list, none of them actually showed up; the roles of the Oniwabanshuu were taken by a couple of charachers new to the movie itself, which may make introducing parts of the Kyoto arc in the next movie kind of awkward), and a few of the smaller things like Yahiko and Sanosuke's introductory arcs, but honestly, it was a very, very good adaptation of +/-3 hours of anime into a two-hour-ten-minutes movie.

Takeru Sato did an excellent job of portraying Kenshin.  The fight scenes were great, especially the one with Sanosuke and his ""Sagara supplex""!  I couldn't stop laughing.

Okay, it's my fault for not looking careful enough that this product isn't directly sold by Amazon.  I just looked at ""Fulfill by Amazon"" and thought I could trust them....
Then upon receiving it, I immediately knew it's fake copy (and yes, some other reviews from here also pointed it's ""Fake"").  I lived in Hong Kong for 12+ years and they have tons of these cheap package DVD for sell on street for about $3 or less.
Maybe this is a perfect DVD copy... but fact is, it's still not a genuine product.  I've bought those cheap stuffs enough and wish to never do that again if I could help it (especially not when they charge 23 for this...)

If you do a quick google search for places like ""Yes Asia.com"".  You'll see that they have a genuine blu-ray copy!  Notice how nice the package compare to images of people submitted here.
And surprisingly that genuine blu-ray cost almost the same as the DVD here! @23 dollars.  Notice I've almost never shop there so I am not suggesting you should buy it there either.  But you should do some research before paying over $20 for this!  I've mentioned this kind of DVD cost $3 in Hong Kong and that's the high price for it!

The actors are perfectly cast (especially Kenshin, Kaoru and Megumi), realistic action and fighting effects, the background detail is impeccable and the storyline, while different than the manga, works brilliantly.

While the plot deviates from the manga and anime, it simply WORKS. And very well at that. In some parts, I actually thought it worked better than the original material - for instance, Jin'e is given a bigger role, which made sense and brought him out as a real villain. I did always think his character was underused in the original series.

The new villain working for Kanryuu (rather than the Oniwabanshu ninjas) is interesting - he struck me as a combination of various villains, specifically Han'nya (for the mask), Aoshi Shinomori (cool attitude), Otowa Hyko (""shadow"" weapons) and Cho (gung-ho fighting style plus some attitude).

Hands down the best anime live action film I have ever seen.",1376265600,,1011,5.078313253012048
5552837,5,B00B209RHY,"This is a very good movie with good action, background scenes, and a very well thought out plot. I was hoping for a sequel to this.

5552838,5,B00B209RHY,"This movie was awesome! Now, if you're expecting a carbon copy of the anime, you will be quite disappointed. However, if you allow some flexibility in your judgement of the movie, I think it captured the basics of the anime (It covers part of the first season). The characters were very well depicted. Some of their personalities are a little tweaked, but you can tell who they are. Also, some of the villains are a mixture of multiple villains in the anime, so that can throw you off a bit, but like I said before, leave some room for flexibility. One thing you might want to take into account is the violence. As an anime, it is pretty easy to ignore the violence because it is animated, but you don't have that luxury with this live action version. So, it can get a bit intense. However, as a whole, it is a very good movie and was very fun to watch.",1376179200,,853,4.304347826086956

5552842,5,B00B209RHY,I saw previews online and it looked good so I decided to buy the DVD.  I really enjoy watching it and I've watched it a couple of times already.  The fighting scenes are really well done and as other reviewers have mentioned there is minimal wire work.  I've watched a lot of Japanese and Chinese sword fighting movies and TV shows and this is definitely one of the better ones and there are some interesting moves.  The story is shortened of course since they need to condense it.  But it was still easy enough to follow for someone who has not read the manga or watched the anime.  It is hard to make a movie to please the manga and anime fans just like it's hard to make a movie that is better than the book unless the book is not written that well.  This movie is very enjoyable and I'll probably watch it again esp. since there's not a lot of good movies out this summer.  The DVD came quickly and in great condition.  It's subtitled which I love.  Hate those fake sounding voice over dubs.,1375056000,,995,4.2727272727272725

The only ""but"" I have is that there are almost no menu options... so no blooper real, no nada, just the movie and options for subtitles or not.  The subtitles themselves are really well done, I only found two, maybe three mistakes in translation, and you could tell simply because the tense was off or something. There was nothing that really took away from the movie or made it unclear, so well done.  Finally, and this is purely just a personal artistic thing. I was really looking forward to getting a DVD with that black and white awesome posed cover, and that is not the cover on the DVD.

Unlike many live action adaptations, this stays true to the heart and soul of the franchise and does not try to recreate every aspect from the animated version.  The action scenes are great. The director said the film's star, Takeru Sato, did much of his own stunt work which made some of the scenes that much more impressive.

The English subtitles are done well and my only complaint (why it did not get a 5 star review) is that many of the signs and bump cards are not translated.

They hit the highlights of the first few episodes.  Don't be like a crazy fan, they had to make concession for the short duration of a move. But as a fan..I'm thinking...they better have 20 more movies coming.  LOL, I need to get to the main event.  Sure as fans we would have preferred a different bad guy...but hey...we would have been pissed if they skipped to the end.  There is just way too much that goes on in Rurouni Kenshin.

They really did try to make it look like it came from the factory but you could tell someone made it by hand. The plastic it was in was wrapped in was very loosely, noting a red flag right away. Then through future inspection I noticed the picture on the disk had glue on it and you could visually see this by looking at the center of the disk. Then on the bottom of the disk you could see small bubbles where this disk was bought at Wal-Mart perhaps and is a burn disk.

Good acting? Every character was acted perfectly!
Sound plot? Hell yeah, it's plot is based off the manga, but not slavishly adhering to it. It made more sense for a 2 hour movie!
Action? Hiten Mitsurugi up in this mother trucker! The fight scenes were perfect. You even got a sense of kenshin's speed, and he's not even going all out yet!

5552860,5,B00B209RHY,"To be expected, there is need for artistic licensing when doing a live action film of an anime series. There is just enough here that allows for the realism necessary to be convinced that this could actually have happened. No question about the characters if you are at all familiar. The only fight scene i was slightly disappointed in was Kenshin vs. Saito. Not gonna say anything else in case you don't want spoilers, but it was quite as epic as the anime fight was. Other than that, highly recommend to fans of the series, and people that are looking into the series.",1371427200,,570,4.543689320388349
5552861,3,B00B209RHY,"So this is personally my favourite manga. Let me start with that.
The movie itself was pretty good. Wasnt a disaster plot wise. And they did a good job of basically squishing 4 different archs into this thing. The movie was much darker in theme than the manga, as it had to be, but still had a couple moments of comic humour. The story focused excessively on Kenshin rather than the introductions of Sanosuke and Yahiko. Which to some degree was fine considering its a movie. None of the old philosophies with Sanosuke and Saito Hajime were even brought up and it only seemed to show that everyone in the war was grouped into the ""killer"" catagory rather than as individuals. The only issue with the movie itself was the films slaughter of the Oniwaban and their merging all of the characters into one Aoshi. Understandably, some of the oniwaban would be too crazy to have in a live action film, but they didn't need to do what they did.
The audio was also a terrible problem. Some scenes were quieter than others and there were like thre musical scores which by the end of the film were all completely overplayed. The subs were TERRIBLE and were worse than had a mexican pirate done them himself.
When it first got in the mail I was sceptical as it looked like a pirate.
So I give the product a 3 out of 5 - 4 out of 5 for the film and 2 out of 5 for the disc and subs itself.",1371168000,2,1377,4.2796934865900385

5552864,5,B00B209RHY,"As a fan of the anime and manga series, I was pretty excited to see Kenshin brought into the world of live action film.  Still, I was not expecting it to be nearly as amazing as it was!

The entire movie was fantastic.  The storyline was great and will please any viewer whether they're die-hard fans of the anime series or have never even heard of Himura Kenshin before.  The visual effects were beautifully done - none of the cheesy, low-budget CG that I'd shamefully anticipated.  The fight scenes were very well-choreographed and I felt that the movie overall stayed close to the source material, which was great to see.

The part that really stood out to me, though, was the casting.  Every single one of our leads really nailed the characters.  Aside from some mild changes to Saito (and I only pick about it because he is my favorite character on the show) they did a great job of depicting not only the appearance, but the attitudes and quirks.  I was positively tickled to hear Kenshin say ""Oro!"" and to see some of the characters actually acting out specific fighting stances from the original show.

The soundtrack was excellent as well!

The only improvement I'd have liked to see made is a translation for the kanji that is shown.  The translations for the subtitles were well-done.

Overall this was a fantastic film and I am delighted that I have added it to my collection!",1370736000,,1388,4.616326530612245

5552868,5,B00B209RHY,"I was prepared to be disappointed by this movie, but boy was I wrong. It was awesome and made me love RK all over again!

The plot follows Kenshin, a wandering swordsman who 10 years ago was the premier teenaged assassin of the rebel army. The movie starts with an awesome battle scene during the last major conflict of the civil war. After they win the war, Kenshin renounces killing. During the next 10 years, he found a reverse blade sword that allows him to use his special sword techniques without killing and wandered the countryside looking for some sort of peace. He ends up stopping in Tokyo when he is waylaid by a woman wielding a bokken named Kaoru. She accuses him of being the notorious assassin Battousai who has been besmirching the name of her dojo. While he was Battousai, he hasn't even heard of her dojo before. Kenshin conceals his identity and acts the fool, so Kaoru apologizes and they part ways. They meet again when Kaoru gets into a fight with the evil assassin Jineh and Kenshin steps in to protect her. They soon end up getting embroiled with a crime/drug lord named Kanryu, a beautiful but flawed doctor named Megumi, a street brawler named Sano, and Kenshin's former Shinsengumi opponent and now head policeman Saito Hajime.

The movie changed a few details from the manga to make the characters and plotlines all fit together in one movie, but they did it (mostly) seamlessly. They did a good job on the English subtitles too, though they didn't translate the opening text introducing the time period and character of Hitokiri Battousai, which was annoying.

The fight scenes were amazing and some of the stances were spot on from the manga. I had mixed feelings about Sano sometimes, as he didn't look quite as I'd imagined, and was occasionally more annoying than amusing. His fight in the kitchen did make me chuckle several times though. Saitou's opening scene wasn't the best (it seemed like they were trying too hard to make him seem obsessive about Battousai to the point of seeming uncaring about his cause), but his modern-day self was super cool, appropriately jerkish, and made me fall in love with his complex character all over again. Megumi was perfect, from the way she looked to dialog to acting self-contained, coquettish, and professionally confident. Initially I was hesitant about the actors playing Kenshin and Kaoru, but they totally won me over, especially Kenshin. There were a few times I found Kaoru disappointingly passive near the end, but part of the problem there was the plot and dialog she was given. Not that she didn't have several good moments of strength, courage, and compassion, because she did. Overall, I'm glad I own it so I can re-watch it. Yay!",1369785600,,2719,4.780851063829787
5552869,5,B00B209RHY,"Just to preface: I'm definitely an otaku. I've never seen an anime live-action adaptation work; some aren't bad, but never as good as the anime itself. This, on the other hand, is exceptional.  It's handily better then the Rurouni series and easily on par with the Kenshin movies (I would honestly say it's better then any of the anime material, though I admit it was a long time ago and my memory of the anime may not be doing it proper service).  At any rate, I would whole heartily recommend it for any fan of Kenshin; it really is that good!

For non Kenshin fans it will be hard to follow all that is going on and it will feel like there are too many characters (there truly is).  However, you don't need to have seen much of the original series to really enjoy this film; the first DVD or two will be enough, which you can probably watch online.  If you can find Rurouni Kenshin through your streaming service of choice, I recommend watching the first 5-10 episodes to familiarize yourself with the characters before watching this film.  Once you've done that, you will definitely enjoy it...

Why is it so good?  It's well made, well cast, well written, well directed, and well shot.  IT'S A GOOD MOVIE.

Technically:
The DVD has OK video compression that won't offend too often (banding in dark areas is common), the colors are fantastic when there's plenty of light, muted at other times (though often when artistically desirable); and for those who care about such things: it's obvious it was shot with a Red.  The audio is stereo only, but it's PCM, so there is plenty of dynamic range, with voices sometimes being difficult to hear next to loud, distortion-free gunfire, but its clear and noise free through out.  The large dynamic range will best benefit a quiet listening environment with plenty of volume; quality HT audio gear won't be wasted.  The production value is exceptional as a whole, video and audio, considering the relatively limited budget and DVD limitations.  The biggest complaint is the mpeg2 compression is not what it could be, but it the story should keep you distracted.",1369612800,,2106,4.6875

5552875,4,B00B209RHY,"*I usually hate these kinds of reviews, so please be warned: this is my review of the film itself, not its DVD as advertised here *

Rurouni Kenshin is the story that inspired me to take up my study of Japanese swordsmanship some nine years ago. Seeing the first trailers of the film with the Warner Brothers logo in front of them, I grew guardedly optimistic that this would be a film that could both satisfy fans and engage neophytes, but also speak to the essence of the story's appeal. For the most part, I think it succeeded.

The film condenses an impressive amount of story and character introductions into two hours and fifteen minutes, with relatively few sacrifices along the way, and it finds the right balance between comedy and drama I think even the source material failed to achieve. Likewise, the fight scenes feel nicely rooted in our three-dimensional world while including enough of the fundamental 2-D over-the-top-super-martial-arts-action to distinguish them from a Zatoichi or a 13 Assassins. Fans will notice a trio of villains imported (and condensed into a pair) from a later storyline (likely to simplify the story, ironically), and might miss the Highlander-esque mid-fight flashbacks dedicated in the comics and anime to backstory exposition, but can hopefully appreciate the tweaks made to bring together the elements needed in a feature-length film. (Newcomers will hopefully feel they're not missing out on too much background.)

Some minor(ish) gripes:

-A couple of significant characters get their names spoken once, maybe twice in dialogue. Two third-tier baddies don't have their names spoken at all. If you already know who they are, fine.  But if you're coming into the story fresh, you might find yourself scratching your chin at times trying to keep everyone in order.

-There are exactly two scenes where the wire work (or maybe framerate considerations) cause a stunt to stick out from the rest of the film. These would be excusable, except one of them kind of ruins a fan-favorite character's most badass moment.

-If I needed urgent medical care for someone, I don't think the local martial arts school is the first place I'd think to flock to.

Allow for some reasonable expectations, and the need to please both fans and casual audiences, and I think Rurouni Kenshin hit this one out of the park. It's not quite the Batman Begins of Japanese comic book movies, but it's far closer to that than it is to their Fantastic Four.",1368748800,,2471,4.951690821256038
5552876,4,B00B209RHY,"Rurouni Kenshin is shot to be a translation of common manga / anime style visuals into a movie. This means that at times the look is a little odd, and although not off putting raises questions over intent.

The other thing is that being an movie means that there had to be some changes. The most obvious is that the main villain (sword fighter) Ud Jin-e is no longer the same as in the source material: he is an amalgamation of the villain from the first TV show. Himself from later on in the series, and rather than being a standalone character / big boss, he works for the other villain (not a sword fighter) Takeda Kanry. Other character are slightly different, though in all instances not substantially so.

As you can guess the plot too is an amalgamation of multiple shows, though overall it feels quite well transitioned.

The film stays true to the amine's style, and character's traits. There is a bit of fan service in there which will make fans smile and is coherent enough (by a long shot) that non fans will be able to enjoy the film. Irrespective though a lot of the historic setting is not explained which might be an issue to non-Japanese viewers who might not know generally what happened leading up to the fictional events of this movie. Overall that's not an issue: there was a war, Kenshin was on the winning side and decides to stop killing. Others have either adapted or carry a grudge, and because of the power shift criminal elements are able to thrive.

Characters are largely taken as established which makes especially Sait Hajime feel one dimensional, although he does only play a very minor role in this film, with some of his actions being implied and then only if you know his character. Overall though this does not detract.

The movie is aimed at a wide audience, as the manga was with lots of action, comedy and a rich setting. It isn't required that the audience know the source material, though a slight background in the events of the Meiji Restoration / End of the Tokugawa Shogunate would not go astray. Despite being long (over two hours) it is never dull, and presents a beautiful translation of the source material into live action.",1367884800,,2174,4.592783505154639

5552878,5,B00B209RHY,"It is rare to go into a film with high expectations and STILL be impressed by it. After so many bad or just okay live action adaptions of favorite anime, Rurouni Kenshin has achieved what fans could only hope for. The period this takes place on is wonderfully portrayed, both gritty and beautiful and shows well the Japanese traditions. I loved the cinematography. The fighting was unbelievably cool to watch, and done in such away that never made me thinking something looked silly and I could only watch with wide eyes thinking, this is awesome. The style and even blood is reminiscent of anime fighting, but it was all epic and nothing cheezy about it. Even the blood was handled artfully. To top it all off the plot and the characters were truly brought to life. The story blended well from start to finish, merging a few different storylines. The actor for Kenshin nailed the role and all the personalities whether with a silly cute smile, saddened by his past, or the dark killer he had been. I have to say every actor and actress in this movie shined in their roles. Despite the darkness of some of the story, it never loses sight of the heart of Kenshin and even has some scenes I was laughing quite hard. In my fiances word, Sanosuke last fight had the best intermission to a fight he had ever seen. Neither of us could stop laughing. I wish more movies could achieve what this one has done and thoroughly look forward to a sequel. Just a note for the DVD itself, was great quality (just no extras) and has the English subs like it says in the product title. My fiance and I are going to be at odds at who is actually keeping the DVD.",1367712000,,1643,4.425742574257426
5552879,5,B00B209RHY,"Out of all the Manga I've ever read, I'd say Rurouni Kenshin is the best, nothing else comes close. This movie is worthy adaptation of the story, and it was great seeing the characters as live actors. I honestly didn't think they'd find someone who could portray Sanosuke, but they pulled it off! It's got more than a few bloody spots, but it's to be expected in a movie filled with Samurai battles. The wonderful thing about the story is that the whole theme is the opposite of most movies, it doesn't glorify the violence. It's about a man trying to live peacefully and atone for his past, suffering the consequences and guilt of his former, violent way of life and refusing to kill even when his own life is on the line. The actor who portrayed Kenshin (Takeru Sato) really made him come alive, balancing the gentle Rurouni with the merciless Hitokiri. It's a wonderful movie, but not for children or people who can't stand the sight of blood.",1367539200,,946,4.570588235294117

5552885,4,B00B209RHY,"This live action anime adaptation is well done overall.  Having seen this in the native Japanese as well as seeing it with the original region subtitles...well...""something is lost in translation.""  I feel this review will likely be for those who have already seen the original series and manga.  I will try to make this relevant to those who haven't.

The movie combines several episodes from the first season and elements from the second season of the anime.  There's a lot of material and characters covered making this inherently a daunting task to cover in two hours.  Personally, I feel this was an excellent effort adequately establishing the character relationships and setting ground for the movie.

Setting is beautiful and really puts you into the era.  Small details in the background, peripheral actions from extras, the costumes all make the scenery work.  It is one of the best period movie sets I've seen in a while.  The festival scene is a good example as well as the brawl between Kenshin and Sanosuke and the final scene simply set in a forest.  If I'm not mistaken, no CGI sets were used either (not counting the CGI blood).  A wonderful breath amid the CGI heavy movies out there.  There's something about real sets that even CGI can't match.  In fact, the lack of CGI gives this movie a 'old movie' feel to me.

The actors capture the different personas well from Kenshin's inner struggle with his past, Kaoru's conflict between her goal to bring justice for her father via a sword style that decries violence, Yahiko's desire to follow a samurai's spirit in an era where samurai are obsolete, Megumi's aloof faade over a guilty conscience and shame and Sanosuke's tough-as-nails-nice-guy-at-heart demeanor.  Some may argue that the characters didn't ""look"" like their anime counterparts, but that seems a bit shallow a criticism.

Action sequences are well choreographed and show how far the wartime-forged skills of ""Hitokiri Battousai"" and Saito were above the adversaries they face in the peaceful Meiji.  The first dojo fight is a great sequence complete with very memorable lines from the anime.  If you've seen both, you know what I mean.  The 'god-like' speed and skills of the ""Battousai"" are well portrayed.

There are a couple of lines where my eyes rolled, but that may be the movie culture of the region versus Hollywood culture.  In any case, they may have been ""meh"" to me but it doesn't diminish the meaning they held in context to the scene.  Specifics aren't necessarily important as most will notice, make a few funny comments, but overall really not care.

SUMMARY:
Even when not compared to the source material, Rurouni Kenshin is a good movie with great setting, character and action.  I look forward to the inevitable sequel!  If you're a fan of the original series, pick it up.  If you've never seen it and like this movie, check out the original series.",1366070400,,2901,4.879345603271983

5552889,4,B00B209RHY,"Whether your a fan of Kenshin manga or Anime, or Anime in general, or fan of Samurai movies, this one is a pretty good movie.

As a fan of Kenshin you may have some complaints, but here again we have a 2hr + movie covering pretty much Season 1 of the anime.  So there are some shortcuts and some rewrites that may bug a fan.  Of course not enough time to flesh out the characters, which is another common issue.  I think my biggest complaint as a fan is the absence of Aoshi, a fight I would like to have seen done in live action. Instead substituted with another henchman, who is interesting, but not Aoshi.  We found the other changes okay or at least tolerable.

We put away knowing the anime and we considered the movie as a stand-alone action Samurai movie. Main heroes and some villians are of course super-human, but thats a part of Kenshin's story. For that we enjoyed it.
Cast was good overall, script was good, music score was good.  I think again most of the improvement could have been in the character relationship developments.  Kaoru falling for Kenshin and why Sanosuke decides to befriend and team up with Kenshin. A little more of Kenshin's signature attacks would have also been welcome to the action.

Looking forward to a movie version of Season 2, if there is one.  Not having to fill out the main characters should leave more room for action and Shishio is my favorite villian.

There are not a lot of DVD extras here to be honest.",1365552000,,1454,4.449056603773585

5552891,5,B00B209RHY,"Being a fan of the anime series and the film ""Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal"", I was ecstatic to learn that a live-action adaptation of ""Rurouni Kenshin"" became one of Japan's highest-grossing film of 2012 and an international success in Asia. Based on the manga by Nobuhiro Watsuki, the film follows the adventures of a young man named Kenshin Himura during the Meiji period. Fans of the anime series would be satisfied with this live-action version as it does capture the mood, tempo and style of the anime series. The film features superb swordplay that I have not seen since ""Azumi"" and while newcomers may see it as a `hack and slash' affair, I am impressed with the amount of effort that went through its production, that director Keishi Otomo truly expressed love for the source material.

The film has been inspired by seasons 1 and 2 of the anime series. After living the life of an assassin since the tender age of 14 and fighting in the Bakumatsu war, Himura Kenshin (Takeru Satoh) has gained a reputation as a legendary swordsman that he has earned the much feared title of ""Hitokiri Battosai"". Now a wandering samurai, he seeks to atone for his sins by taking an oath of not killing and protecting those in need. In his travels, Kenshin comes across the daughter of a deceased dojo master, Kaoru (Emi Takei) and aides her against her assailants. The two have formed a unique form of friendship, as Kenshin realizes a chance to find peace. But when a crooked businessman named Takeda (Teruyuki Kagawa) has plans of his own for taking over the harbor where the dojo stood, Kenshin must do what he can to protect what he has found. With the aid of Sagara Sanosuke (Munetaka Aoki), he must confront the forces of Takeda and save the life of a young woman named Megumi (Yu Aoi). But his past just continues to haunt him as a master swordsman called Jin-ei who delves in the Jutou mystical arts, wants Kenshin's blood.

Director Otomo manages to keep the essence of the anime alive when it came to tempo, mood and style. I do have to admit that deviations from the source material was inevitable for editing and pacing purposes. I could say that the movie was loosely based off the first couple of seasons of the anime series, as characters such as Sagara, Yahiko (Taketo Tanaka), Saito Hajime (Yosuke Eguchi) and Kaoru all make appearances to drive the film's plot. Sadly, while I enjoyed this film, I cannot deny that characterization was a little too light and the screenplay opts to put all its energy in the fight choreography and action set pieces. The emotional content of the material was admittedly a little lost, as the movie revolved mainly on Kenshin and Kaoru.

Villains such as Gein (Gou Ayano) and Banjin Inui (Genki Sudo) were easily recognizable by fans but they were a little underwritten into the script. This is not a complaint, but an observation. The motivations behind the Jin-ei Udo's actions weren't sold into the screenplay that the only tension I felt between him and Kenshin was the coming climactic showdown. There was a missed opportunity in developing the 'sword that spilled a lot of blood' and just how Jin-ei got his mystical skills. The screenplay should've done well in developing that part of its narrative. I know fans of the anime could easily connect the dots, but this does leave newcomers left with little more than what was presented to them by the film.

Be that as it may, the film does succeed in a way that it intended. Mild humor was brought forth by Sagara and while lacking in development, it was easy to get interested with the film's plot as it moved briskly and never lost its energy. The swordplay was truly the film's top draw, Otomo shot the scenes in a way that mimicked the style and intensity of the anime series. It was also never a loss for blood, as the swordfights were brutal at certain moments, and yet it never lost that feeling of rhythm in the emotional drama with each hack and slash. There was a certain identity to its swordplay that I enjoyed, while there was no gore, it had the sense of poignancy that I have to expect from samurai films. I do have to say that Otomo did his homework in selling the film through the fight choreography, there were mild uses of special effects but they were only used to enhance the speed and strength of the struggle. The signature moves of Sagara and Kenshin also came into play, and if this was any indication, there may be a lot of room for a sequel since Kenshin had only began to fight. The costumes and set designs were all done in the spirit of the anime, and the colors leaned towards Earth colors as with any other jidai geki film. This gave the film a cinematic feel that is familiar to fans of the genre.

The performances were decent for the most part. Satoh made for a very credible Kenshin Himura. He had the look, the appearance and the personality to pull it off. With Otomo's cool editing tricks, he made the Kenshin character come alive in all the fight sequences, and Satoah looked really cool in performing the moves. Emi Takei makes for a very convincing Kaoru Kamiya, as the woman with the strength to influence a conflicted Kenshin. Aoki was fun as the cocky Sagara, but I had mixed feelings with Kagawa as Kanryu Takeda. He was a little too manic for his own good. Koji Kikkawa was magnificent as the creepy Battosai even though his character lacked depth, he was effective in the build up to the final showdown.

""Rurouni Kenshin"" the live-action film may be flawed, but it was one of the better ones I have seen along with ""Azumi"", ""Death Note"" and ""Shinobi Heart Under Blade"" (Lord knows there is a lot of them out there that are bad). The film was made with love of the source material, and the action swordplay was just fantastic. It was fast, hard-hitting and exciting to watch. Newcomers may feel a little lost with the lack of characterization and development, but fans of the original material and the anime series would feel right at home. I would advise those who have no prior knowledge of the anime series to take a look at ""Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal"", as it will give you much needed background to the character (really seeing the first two seasons of the anime series would be more beneficial). This film is fine companion piece to the anime film and the series, that fans will not be able to stay away. Me, I am a fan so it gets a High Recommendation from me to its fans. To non-fans, at the very least, it is a solid hack and slash affair, that is really well done. [4   Out of 5 Stars]",1365379200,3,6544,4.544529262086514

This movie is gorgeous! I love the fact that they cast actors that closely resemble the anime characters, (like the Tokyo police chief).

I really can't wait to they get to the Makoto Shishio arc. I know that's some time off but I can dream right ? Good, no great job to the production team, cast, crew, anyone that was in anyway affiliated with this film. They did a very great job capturing Kaoru's cute childish side especially in the scene with the cat under the bridge, and then also showing her more serious side with how she gets in Kenshin and Jinei's faces.

5552907,5,B00B209RHY,"I'm probably not the only person that tenses up a little when they hear that a manga they like is being made into a live action series or movie. Too many times producers adapt a storyline for the big screen and completely remove the aspects that made the original book so wonderful.

This is thankfully not the case with the Rurouni Kenshin live action movie. They did make some changes and small additions and omissions but overall this first movie remains very true to the original Oniwabanshu arc from the manga. I cannot speak for the anime because I haven't watched it in its entirety but from having read the manga many times and loved it, I thought this movie was about as perfect as it could possibly be. I am already hoping they will actually consider an international release and a sequel (providing the first movie sold well in Japan).

SPOILERS >>>>>>>
Even though he wasn't really there in the manga (at this point at least), I am pleased they included Hajime Saitou. Let's face it, he's the best of Kenshin's rivals and it's really hard not to like him and to be pleased with his inclusion in this movie. I was also very much impressed with how they covered the scene with Kenshin and Tomoe. They certainly didn't go into detail and explain the whole sordid story but they gave the viewer a taste of the reasons Kenshin stopped killing. There is scene where he explains his scar to Megumi but at the same time he says ""a samurai and the wife of a samurai I killed,"" and doesn't go into more detail than that. For this movie, they provided just enough backstory on his previous life while still making it mysterious.

I don't know what else I can say, I was so excited watching this movie that I'm still sad it's over. It was excellent and the ending was perfect. If I could have picked a fight to end the movie on, it would have been Kenshin's battle with Jin-eh.

But the best part is that its self-contained enough that you could show this movie to someone who hadn't seen the anime or read the manga and they'd still be able to keep up with the plot and enjoy the movie.",1363046400,2,2087,4.427083333333333

But, as production stills started to surface and then finally an actual trailer, I was finding myself cautiously optimistic. What I was seeing looked fantastic and I was excited to see it.  This DVD makes it possible.

This is a nicely done release and comes neatly packaged. The disc comes in the usually plastic case, which is enclosed in a sturdy dust cover. The actual print is clean and clear with a beautiful picture quality, but the best part is that the translation is surprisingly good. I was thrilled!

8561202,5,B00B209RHY,"This is the first of three movies covering the first two seasons of Rurouni Kenshin or Kenshin all the way up to, and concluding Shishio's arc.

This first movie covers many of the big plot points in the first season and it's here that its one flaw is exposed. Because there are so many beats to cover, the movie needs to assume that you are familiar with the characters otherwise it'd easily be twice as long. Personally I'm of two minds on this. On the one hand, it would have been nice to see them take their time to develop the characters and story in this one especially because those who are unfamiliar with the source material would obviously start here. On the other, I also appreciate that this is effectively a love letter to fans of the series by rewarding them with a incredible cinematic experience. I'll let you, dear reader, come to your own conclusion on this.

With that singular flaw out of the way. and as a fan of the series myself, I have to say that I absolutely loved this film. The action is wonderfully choreographed. Rare are the times where you don't know where the players are in a given fight scene or what's going on. And it's also obvious that serious study was put into the moves of the characters from the anime and special attacks and the like were easily identifiable as they were used here. The players as well, all perform magnificently and I especially loved J. Michael Tatum's take on Kanryu - with a constant scowl upon his face and animated facial expressions he really sold the role well.

In conclusion, if you've never seen Rurouni Kenshin before, I strongly recommend watching the first two seasons of the anime. Season 3 isn't worth it as it doesn't follow the manga. Normally I don't really care about things like this (blasphemy I know) but in this case I absolutely do. The third season should have addressed Enishi and, sadly, it does not. Once you do watch the anime,and if you enjoyed what you saw, come back and watch the live action movies.

If you're a fan of the series already but have been gun-shy about seeing a beloved anime potentially ruined allow me to allay your fears. This movie has a lot of heart, and a lot of work clearly went into it to properly represent the manga/anime. Get this and rejoice.",1506988800,,2264,4.514634146341463

8561207,5,B00B209RHY,"By far one of the best adaptations of any series to any medium. The characters are just as likable in this movie as they were in the book (with a few exceptions to some characters who don't get the screen time they deserve). the story, even though it does not follow the books verbatim is still very good and very fun to watch. The best part of these movies are the fight scenes. I don't know who choreographed them but they are works of art save for one or two moments. if your a fan of anime, or just movies in general you should see this movie. it is a great example of mediums being adapted to other mediums.",1474848000,,612,4.151260504201681
