2687358,2,B000KB4898,"I wasn't expecting Disney.

I love many of Terry's past films.

Yet I fall under the category of those ""who (didn't) like the film"". It's not because I feel that I didn't get it, or because I was offended by what took place, (Drug abuse, necrophilia, etc) I was simply disappointed. While Tideland has it's moments of beauty and intrigue, most of it comes across one dimensionally in its absurdity, with situations too unbearable for any child to endure, let alone embrace. Children are subjected to all means of unfairness and atrocity, but what little girl would chose to hug and kiss the decomposing remains of her long dead father?!? While I wasn't expecting realism from this film, the metaphors are often upstaged by their shock value.

  And from a child's perspective?? No, it's an attempted view of childhood innocence by men whose direction and writing reveal character that's reactionary toward nostalgic childhood conventions.

To be fair, I haven't read the novel, but purely as a first time whole experience-- 2 stars.",1172534400,8,1032,4.97093023255814
2687359,5,B000KB4898,"Rarely has a film been able to capture that vivid imagination of the age of innocence - as seen through the eyes of Jeliza Rose (Jodelle Ferland).  Caught within a twisted existence of heroin, death, and talking squirrels, Jeliza seems to be falling down a rabbit hole, to the point where reality becomes the illusion.  Played on after the adventures of ""Alice in Wonderland"", Jeliza lives in a world of talking dolls, where death is the joke, and strange is the warm welcome to a garden of roses.  To those familiar with the strange and peculiar vision of director Terry Gilliam (Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Brazil, The Fisher King, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas) will at once fall in love with the humanity of this film, as it does transcend beyond mind and soul, into a realm of the unknown.  Images burst off the screen, as the camera makes love to the emotion of its characters, letting a radiance of beauty shine upon the screen.  Gilliam, once again, invites us to gaze through a looking glass into a world of chaos and misery.  And this time, it is through the eyes of a child - the carefree drifter that once was in each of us.  There's also a truly remarkable performance by Brendan Fletcher, whom I remember first having seen in Goosebump's ""The Werewolf of Fever Swamp"" - he surely has matured as an actor!",1172275200,15,1324,4.53781512605042
2687360,5,B000KB4898,"This DVD has an introduction from Terry Gilliam at the beginning of the film, in it he says ""I've got a confession to make, a lot of you aren't going to like this film."" It's sad, but it's true, it's true because there are some very controversial scenes in the film, it's sad because a lot people won't be able to look past that, and see what a brilliant film this really is. No, these scenes don't have to be in the film, but maybe Gilliam's making a point about how we see the world; ""If it's disturbing it's because it's innocent.""

Tideland is the story of a little girl named Jeliza- Rose who travels to a small house in the country with her father, the film shows how she deals with her difficult life with imagination, the film's dark and disturbing, but ultimately optimistic.

There's a lot for Gilliam fans here, the camera angles, the odd fantasy elements and the strange dark humor.

This film could have been terrible if it hadn't been done properly, but the film stays interesting and gripping because of the connection Gilliam gives us to Jeliza-Rose.

I'm not here to judge, and if people don't like this film they're entitled to, but all I'm saying is give it a chance, because a fair few of you, like me, are going to love it for the beautiful film it is.",1171065600,164,1273,4.404255319148936

2687435,2,B000KB4898,"This is the first Terry Gilliam film which I didn't like at all. Even if by making ""Tideland"" Gilliam clearly proved once again that he really knows how to make films, I found the whole story absolutely gross, deeply sick and morally REPULSIVE and I was hardly able to it finish watching it.

This film is about 11 year old Jeliza-Rose (Jodelle Ferland). When we meet her first she lives in some large city, in a miserable dump with her very poor and absolutely abject parents. Her father, Noah (Jeff Bridges), is an aging, struggling musician, who in his better moments know how to invent cool games and tell a good story - and we could maybe feel some sympathy for him, if he wasn't a drug addict, who trained Jeliza-Rose when she was still a little girl to prepare his daily injection of heroine... We never learn the real name of her mother (Jennifer Tilly) - Jeliza-Rose and Noah just call her ""Queen Gunhilda"" - but it is clear from the first moments of the film that she is a totally degenerate junkie, hardly even able to function anymore... Then, a couple of minutes into the film, something happens and as a result Noah and Jeliza-Rose take a trip to rural Texas. They go to the place where Noah was born - and then the film really begins.

This being a Terry Gilliam film, from the technical point of view everything is done very well. Images are actually pretty impressive, the story (even if it is sick and perverted) flows harmoniously and also actors were selected well and encouraged to perform with skill. Especially great praise must be given to Jodelle Ferland who was only 11 years old at that time - and did an incredible job.

A precision here, concerning the character of Noah, played by Jeff Bridges. Some reviewers said that he reminded them of Dude from ""Big Lebowski"" - but I strongly disagree! Dude, albeit by his own decision a marginal, was actually a rather likeable and certainly harmless, well, dude... Noah on another hand is really a piece of human garbage - with hardly any redeeming traits...

The scenario however is, well, I guess the only possible word to describe the scenario is SICK! In his films Terry Gilliam always had a very personal relationship with reality and it will come as no surprise that large parts of ""Tideland"" happen actually in some... unusual states of mind. Usually, this actually makes the charm of his movies - and yes, here also, the imaginary world of a very unhappy and probably slightly unbalanced child, is indeed a more pleasant place than the reality. Most of the story however describes precisely this real reality - and it is simply repugnant to watch! You take the grossest parts of ""Jabberwocky"", the most disturbingly insane parts of ""Brazil"", the most cruel elements ot ""12 Monkeys"" and you will get the idea. Add to this the fascination with deformed bodies and minds, throw in sexual perversions and you will have a general idea of how gross this film is. There are moments we can actually almost really SMELL the decaying bodies and rotten minds...

Every time I thought that this film couldn't go deeper into gross and abject, I was wrong - with every next ten minutes, this film gets more disgusting. SPOILER ALERT HERE! I am shocked that Terry Gilliam could show on the screen an 11 year old girl kissing - by no means innocently - a grown up man (and the fact that this character is supposed to be mentally handicapped doesn't change anything). I am almost shocked that an 11 year old child was asked to play scenes in which she mixes drugs and cuddles a (supposedly) dead decaying body... I am even more shocked that her parents accepted that...

Once again, I must grant to Terry Gilliam, that he knows how to make films and even that one can actually cause a kind of morbid fascination. But still, this is an abject thing. For the life of me I cannot understand why Terry Gilliam made ""Tideland"" and why did he have to put an 11 year old girl through the filming of this... this... thing... This is clearly the sickest and the most depraved of his films and I am sorry that I watched it. AVOID!",1417996800,2,4082,4.577291381668947

2687440,3,B000KB4898,"I should predicate this review by stating that I am an enormous fan of Terry Gilliam. I think the movie ""Brazil"" was one of the best films of the 1980s, and the ""Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" was equally brilliant. Then we have Tideland. As is usual with Gilliam's movies, Tideland is a descent into the very strange. It would be an error to say this movie lacked creativity, it does not; at his worst Gilliam is more creative than 99% of Hollywood. Tideland is by far his worst film; again, not because of a lack of creativity, but because the movie itself is a nightmare. At first I thought it was going to be a sort of bleak anti-Alice in Wonderland dark fantasy, and in some ways I suppose it is (complete with references to Alice). The problem with this movie is that it is just too bleak, too disturbing, too twisted. If I could have sat with Gilliam during the production process (keeping in mind I am a huge fan), I would have turned to him and said ""Don't do it."" If he replied but there is a lot of time and money put into this movie, I would have said ""write it off on your taxes as a loss, then take all copies of this movie to the top of an active volcano and toss them in, because nothing good can come of this film except perhaps a lesson in the dangers of creative genius gone horribly awry."" This film shows the viewer what can go wrong when creative genius turns dark, morbid, perverse, and debauched. While I was tempted to place this film alongside the film ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"", this latter film, despite being dark, never sinks to the same ghoulish depths as Tideland. Tideland is an enormously disturbing dream brought to life on the screen, brilliant in its power to disturb, but absolutely pointless. I am also a fan of David Cronenberg, despite Cronenberg's tendency to descend into disturbing/debauched themes and images. But Gilliam makes Cronenberg's films look like ""feel good"" hits by comparison. I would call this movie a trainwreck, but it is more like the morbid aftermath of a trainwreck complete with bodies that have been left too long in the sun and are now turning putrid. Watching this film is quite literally like watching corpses decay. The potential viewer should consider themselves forewarned.",1391126400,3,2250,4.599502487562189
2687441,4,B000KB4898,"Blu-ray is a German release. Starts with automated Germany version of industry copyright warning, then launches into a foreword by Terry Gilliam with German dubbing over his voice. Use ""Audio"" button on remote control to switch to English audio. After foreword the film automatically starts and you can use remote to go to top menu. Select English soundtrack and turn off the German subtitles (the only subtitles available). Start playing again. Gilliam's short foreword basically warns that folks will either love or hate his film and advises them to see it as a child would. Blu-ray transfer is excellent in both picture quality and audio (including the 5.1 English).

I agree with Gilliam's foreword that this film MUST be viewed keeping the mind of a child. Also helps immensely if one's childhood had a good amount of unstructured or minimally semi-structured play time which relied on imagination to create things to do. Sadly, too many contemporary childhoods are so structured 24/7 that kids' imaginations are being crippled. They grow up relying on someone . . . or a book of procedures/rules . . . telling them what to do, how to do it, and when to do it. This film requires being able to appreciate a 9-year old's imagination. It's the only thing she has, along with four doll heads, to entertain herself (until she meets Dell and Dickens). Too many try to read too much into the friendship the girl, Jeliza-Rose, develops with Dickens, a 20-year old retarded boy with a brain that was surgically split to reduce his epileptic seizures. His mental age is about the same as Jeliza-Rose (pre-pubescent). Their play in a couple of scenes is no more than what they've observed adults do, comprehending only a fraction of it. It **IS** what children do, even younger ones than these. Observing and mimicking adult behavior does not mean they fully comprehend it. This is evidenced when Jeliza-Rose accidentally observes Dell with a grocery delivery boy. it's very clear she does NOT understand what she sees; indeed she interprets it completely differently from what it is (won't say more about the scene or it would be spoiled). I believe that scene is there to try to drive home this point.

If one can maintain the eyes and mind of a per-pubescent child when viewing the film, and fully appreciate the imagination of a child, then the ability of that imagination to help cope with dire situations and gruesome circumstances will come through as the main element of the film. It's not that she's losing her sanity with the four doll heads, rabbit hole, squirrel and overturned bus wreckage with its fireflies. It's how she's keeping her sanity. The doll characters are not speaking to her, they're her internal dialog as she sorts out what she's seeing, how to interpret it, and what to do. She knows they're not ""real"" and this is subtly demonstrated in several places. That she pretends that her father, Noah, is still alive is a coping mechanism. She wouldn't know what to do or what would happen if he really is dead. She does know mostly how to go about living and take care of herself in the present if he's still alive but on an extended ""vacation"" (how he characterizes his heroin trips). There's no doubt that deep down she realizes he is dead (there are hints of this), just like her mother, but it's easier to ignore and delay acceptance of it until ability to cope with it arises. Those who think her behavior less than sane were NEVER really children and I pity their deprived childhoods. Viewed through adult eyes as an adult results in a superficial experience, completely missing the real depth this film contains, and completely misinterpreting various characters' behaviors. In my opinion, it's why many of those that *hate* this film, do so.

Tideland is not the best Gilliam film, but it's not his worst. It contains considerable depth about childhood, its innocence and the true capability of its imagination. It's very sad this film did not see wider theatrical release in the U.S. and that there hasn't been a U.S. Blu-ray release yet, only a German one that fortunately plays in Region A Blu-ray players.",1381708800,2,4136,4.830747531734838

2687444,4,B000KB4898,"Terry Gilliam is generally known for expansive, artificially constructed films such as BRAZIL.  With TIDELAND he takes a much more narrow focus.  Based on the 2000 novel by Mitch Cullin, the film concerns Jeliza-Rose (Jodelle Ferland), a child, who finds herself in an impossible situation.  Her mother (Jennifer Tilly) has died; her father (Jeff Bridges) has panicked and taken her to an abandoned house in rural Texas, where he too dies; and Jeliza-Rose is left to fend for herself.

The result is not easily described.  Jeliza-Rose becomes interested in a neurotic neighbor (Janet McTeer) and her imbecile brother (Brendan Fletcher), and her association with them gives rise to home-made embalming and questionable affection for both her father's corpse and the imbecile brother.  Jeliza-Rose responds with a semi-psychotic state in which she talks to her dolls' heads, which she wears on her fingers; falls down a rabbit hole, just as Alice did; and ultimately stumbles into a tragedy that may in fact lead her back to normalicy.  Although a goodly number of these events are distasteful, TIDELANDS depicts them in cinematic beauty, and the effect is one of tremendous schism between the actual events and the way in which they are portrayed.

The cast is extremely, extremely good.  Jodelle Ferland gives an astonshing performance; so too does the supporting cast, with Jeff Bridges a notable case in point.  Director Terry Gilliam endows the entire project with a bizarre vision, dragging us--often unwillingly--into Jeliza-Rose's strange, often surrealistic world with a tremendous sense of alien beauty.  It is strange, unsettling, peculiar, odd, graceful, delicate, ugly, and off hand I would say it is his best work since BRAZIL.  The double DVD includes a host of bonuses, including an audio commentary, a making-of documentary, and deleted scenes.  Recommended, but you have to go into this one with an open mind.

2687445,4,B000KB4898,"This movie moved, repulsed and disturbed me. As I watched I found myself cringe, recoil in horror, dread for Jeliza Roses's fate and saddened by all the pain, misery and confusion that that child was exposed to, with no one to care for her but egotistical adults and deranged madmen. In an emotional level I responded tremendously to the movie and although a good deal of these responses were less than agreeable, the fact that this film produced such stimuli in my person proves that it has heart to spare- a mean, bashing, horrific,depressing and sad heart it may be but a heart nonetheless. I can only suggest this film to brave movie buffs who are willing to subject themselves to the one of the most bizarre, terrifying and moving experiences of their life.

2687451,2,B000KB4898,"Tideland is preceded by a message from director Terry Gilliam in which he says that the film is seen through the eyes of a child. He asks his adult viewers to forget their preconceived notions and see things normally considered repulsive are innocent in a child's mind.

This message sums up the fundamental flaw of Tideland: it is lazy filmmaking. I don't think Gilliam challenged himself here. How easy is it to take a child, place him or her in a repugnant situation, then stick a disclaimer at the beginning of your film asking your audience to forget everything that has been engrained in their minds since birth? Anyone can do that. What needs to be done in order for a film like Tideland to accomplish its goals is for the filmmaker to understand a simple truth: you cannot ask your audience to forget their way of thinking; you have to make them see it in a different way. This is where one must challenge oneself. One must tear at the very fabric of perception and cinematic presentation in order for the audience to see the film as he or she does.

This is where Gilliam stumbles, as made all too evident by that pesky disclaimer. The child in this film is Jeliza-Rose, who, throughout the course of this film, undergoes abuse from her mother, helps her father take drugs, witnesses death, mutilation, and sex, and flirts with a mentally disabled man. Of course, this is all innocent to her. Her mother is just her mother, her father takes little vacations, the man is her first boyfriend, and sex...well, she has no idea what sex is. So why, Gilliam, why do you present these things in a way that makes it nearly impossible for almost anyone who is going to be viewing Tideland to see things as Jeliza-Rose does on any genuine level? Of course preconceived notions are going to get in the way! Don't just try to sucker your audience into believing you've made a ""difficult"" film and it's their fault if they don't understand. That's cheap. On the contrary - it's your fault for not forcing them to understand! Feeling the need to precede your film with a type of warning should have set off alarm bells right away. At the very least, stand by your work!

Furthermore, Gilliam's approach is inconsistent. While most of the occurrences in the film are filmed as an adult would see them, there are several moments in which the film's world seems to transform - a closet goes on forever, a field becomes a deep sea, dolls' heads float and live. They serve as evidence that Gilliam just might understand the concept of genuinely showing things from a child's perspective. While these moments are strong in and of themselves, they do not fit with the film as a whole and end up causing Tideland to feel incoherent.

Now, allow us to forget the matter of perspective. What is it beside that about Tideland that didn't sit well with me? Well, you have to understand that I rate films based primarily on the feeling they evoke in me. Atmosphere, if you will. I found Tideland unpleasant. No, not in the way you're probably thinking. Unpleasant in the sense that Jeliza-Rose's surroundings felt literally dirty. I felt as though I could feel dust clinging to my skin and dirt caking underneath my fingernails. Yuck. And I hate to bring this up again, but if Jeliza-Rose doesn't feel that way, why should I?

However, I would like to mention that despite all this, the film's ending is breathtaking. It has a beautiful, almost Fellini-esque grandeur that really moved me.

Overall, Tideland is a mess. I did not even mention how irritating Gilliam's directorial style is when he indulges himself, and he is at his most unrestrained here. Mix that with a filmic presentation that doesn't know what it wants to be and one is left with a lazy film thickly coated with the pretense of being ""difficult"". There is nothing difficult about the thoroughly easy Tideland.",1356048000,2,3862,4.663729809104258

It's very ""messed up"", so in a way I guess it is a horror movie. The beginning wasn't too bad, when it started reaching the incline of the plot, it started getting a bit disturbing... then more disturbing... and a little more... But the ending made it better. I was very afraid to watch this movie after seeing the previews it had (since I'm used to previews being like the movie itself) and seeing all the warnings here on amazon and even from the director at the beginning of the movie. Again, to some this may indeed be disturbing because there is ***SPOILER*** drug use, mental illness, neglect I suppose, sex (though only one scene and its not very graphic like you typically see here in Hollywood), and a bit of pedophile behavior (though the girl is not harmed, she does not use drugs and is not sexually molested or raped or something like that. There also is no physical abuse just neglect really. I was afraid that there would be physical abuse or something sexually happening to the girl, but I was relieved that there was not (I would have stopped watching if there was, I just can't handle that stuff.))

Overall though, I am glad I watched it. It kind of makes me thankful for my life now, and putting myself in the girl's shoes, for me would just be terrible. Other than that I'm just shocked, I guess would be the word.

***IMPORTANT*** This is not like ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"", I thought it would be but it isn't.

Why should children not be held liable for their actions? Isn't it the lack of experience? The lack of anticipation of the outcome of their own behaviour? That's why parents are needed to guide through childhood. What is it I want to say? A lot of readers saw horror, insanity, sex and cruelty. Well, look carefully, there isn't any of that. It's your life experience altering your perception. Viewing this movie I catched myself being carried away by judging a situation rather than looking what actually was happening.

Once again Gilliam is working with the mighty Jeff Bridges, who joined Gilliam in the masterpiece, The Fisher King. The young Canadian actress Jodelle Ferland was absolutely astonishing as Jeliza-Rose. She went on to do other major movies such as Silent Hill and Twilight: Eclipse.

Striking UK actress Janet McTeer once again proves her chameleon-like ability to assume any character, with her lean, six-feet tall frame adding even more power to her haunting portrayal of Dickens's crazy older sister, Dell.

Tideland is a fascinating study of how a traumatized young girl's mind deals with the madness that is her everyday life, and the pseudo-realities with which she buffers herself from the abyss.

2687486,5,B000KB4898,"I have a history with Terry Gilliam, well with his films anyway. Seeing BRAZIL at its Chicago premiere, early in 1986 on the 2nd date with my first girlfriend was a defining movie moment for me; it was one of a select few modern films that really helped me to appreciate what the medium could do. Also, it was played at an earsplitting volume and it was on one of the biggest screens in the city at the time...all in all an unforgettable experience.

So I've loved the director ever since, which makes it rather inexplicable that I waited to this long to see TIDELAND, a film problematic in its release and reception even for Gilliam, who unfortunately has to be used to such things by now. I guess that on a certain level I found the storyline, what I knew of it anyway, rather unnerving and perhaps something I just didn't want to deal with at this moment in my life; and indeed, it is an unnerving, disquieting film - but it is also a film that sucked me in and moved me and consistently kept me enthralled, so it was worth some of the discomfort that I felt throughout. Sometimes a little pain can open us up and get our energies going more than a lot of pleasure.

As we open, young Jeliza Rose (Jodelle Ferland) lives with her drug-addict parents, somewhere not really explained....but she really lives in a fantasy-world of ""Alice in Wonderland"" and travel across the sea, made palpable and real when she and her aging rocker daddy Noah (Jeff Bridges) leave her suddenly-dead mother (Jennifer Tilly) for a trip back to Noah's past, in the windswept prairies of Texas. The literary Alice meets the cinematic Land of Oz on the broad prairie landscape as we soon encounter the mad, Wicked-Witch-like Dell (Janet McTeer) and her retarded brother (maybe...?) Dickens (Brendan Fletcher), and the action for the rest of the film revolves around the two dilapidated farmhouses and unspoken mysteries at the heart of childhood and adolescence, forbidden longings and never-revealed secrets that fuel Jeliza Rose's already potent imagination as she retreats into an imaginary and impossible world every bit as potent as those of her drug-addled parents and the mentally challenged pair she meets.

I've rarely seen a film that communicates both the beauties and terror of solitude and solitary myth-making, the sadness of a lonely child underpinning that child's forays into invention and recreating her own desolate world.  Ferland is absolutely remarkable, inhabiting not only the overactive and brilliant mind of Jeliza Rose but also her four distinct talking doll heads, who gradually become more and more distinct and ""real"" as Jeliza's world crumbles - seemingly unnoticed - around her.  At the end, it takes a literal explosion of violence to bring Jeliza back to the real world. Maybe.

I'm still sorting through my feelings on this; it was at times rather depressing and difficult to watch, perhaps because of what I'm bringing to it at the moment myself, but it's a beautiful film (unfortunately marred by a DVD transfer that cuts the 'scope aspect ratio down to 1.85, God knows why) and it does, in fact, fit in extraordinarily well with Gilliam's overarching theme of the power of fantasy and imagination and its inability to ever be completely squelched by the nature of ordinary, dull reality.  It's far more successful and interesting overall than the higher-profile BROTHERS GRIMM from the same year and it's a terrible shame that it got such a poor release.  The director clearly hasn't lost his touch, which makes me all the more excited about IMAGINARIUM OF DR. PARNASSUS coming up.",1256515200,8,3598,4.858075040783034

It just flounders and is ultimately irritating and tedious to get through. We're supposed to be amazed at the young girl's perseverance and tenacity as a reflection on the power of innocence to overcome insanity, profanity, neglect, abuse, etc., but you actually feel like you're watching the child in the film being abused by the film itself and are not able to do anything about it. It isn't clever, it's just kind of sick. I watched Gilliam's introduction after I had seen the film, and it was more entertaining than the actual film to hear him try to explain away the massive and reckless self indulgence that this film is. To me, the introduction revealed that Gilliam himself knows in his heart that  this has fallen apart, and yet he can't quite get himself to admit it. It was a lot like listening to Tim Burton trying to explain away the mish mash at the end of his take on Planet of the Apes. ""I just go with my feelings."" Please. The thing that really hurts about these weak films is how much we know these directors are actually capable of.

The young actress, Jodelle Ferland gave an absolutely remarkable performance; especially for a youngster of her age. Casting her was perhaps the most brilliant stroke in this film.

Gilliam crafted a movie as eloquent and beautiful as it is bizarre and twisted. It delves into the mind of a young girl who handles a troubled - yet surprisingly love filled - upbringing with a strange grace. Well into the film, I finally understood what Gilliam was doing (I hope). This is meant to show the story from the perspective of a young girl's imagination. We see everything through her eyes and experience on an almost visceral level her interpretation of the events of her tragic life.

And as I mentioned, there's a surprising amount of love in the movie. Her drug addict loser dad (played by Jeff Bridges) showed her nothing but kindness and affection, despite his considerable defects of character and irresponsibility.

The character of Jelize-Rose (Jodelle Ferland) was brilliantly performed and directed. Young Ms. Ferland's performance was as professional and compelling as any actress could hope to deliver.

And you got a sense that no matter how weird events became, you knew that in the end all would be well. The worst of everything never seemed to touch little Jelize-Rose too deeply, and she displayed a remarkable strength and resiliency.

[SPOILERS TO FOLLOW]

I don't get it: so Jeliza-Rose's heroin addicted father takes her to his mother's home, a mother who is dead but he was never notified of this?  Her house is empty with all her stuff still there?  She lives in a big field of hay next to a busy train?? Her neighbors keep dead people in their house? No one finds this odd?  I live in New York my whole life but I think that even the most country of bumpkins would find that SOMEONE like the mailman or a neighbor would have noticed the smell of rotting flesh? That smell doesn't bother ANYONE, not even a small girl?  I don't know, maybe I'm just nit-picking but I kept thinking that all of these things were just parts of Jeliza-Rose's mind.  Reading the plot on Wikipedia and all these reviews has alerted me that I'm quite wrong.  Maybe I should have read the book first.

The only good part about this movie was the acting. It appeared to have a tremendously low budget so it could not turn out the spectacular visuals of movies like Pan's Labyrinth or The Fountain, which is a shame because I got tired of looking at rotting corpses, doll heads, and hay for two hours.  But the acting was excellent.  That girl - whoever played Jeliza-Rose - was a tremendously talented actress.  She dominated the film often by herself for a large amount of time, having to switch on and off between being herself and being those dolls.  Excellent actress.  Dickens and Dell were also great and Jennifer Tilly and Jeff Bridges were virtually unrecognizable as the drug-addicted dirtbag parents. Excellent acting on everyone's part.

Unfortunately, the good acting didn't do enough to make up for the confusing plot (for me, at least). I found too many holes in the plot and I kept thinking that Jeliza-Rose was making everything up, sort of reverting to a fantasy world as a child's way of avoiding having to deal with the very adult notion of having become an orphan within like a week.  At the very end [again, SPOLER ALERT] when she thinks she sees Dickens by the train wreck but it turns out just to be some wounded and traumatized man, it reinforced for me that these people WERE figments of the imagination. I even thought maybe she and her father hadn't made it to the grandmother's house and that they'd been on the train when it crashed. (I didn't get that Dickens had used his dynamite to derail the train).  Where did Dickens - a mentally retarded boy/man - get dynamite? What was the significance of Jeliza-Rose catching Dell doing SOME crazy sexual thing to some guy in the shed?  What was up with that squirrel?  Maybe these are questions for the author of the book and not the creator of the movie, I don't know.

Just way too confusing and boring for me. But, as I said before, maybe I'm just not smart enough to ""get"" it all. My advice? It's a weird weird movie; try putting it on your Netflix queue before paying for it, since I hear the DVD version has awful aspect ratio anyway. Or you can watch it on cable.

2687497,5,B000KB4898,"If your looking for a fantasy escape by way of a Disneyland-Hollywoodistic flair, then keep on looking. There's plenty of other films. This is a story about an abused kid and it should be uncomfortable. The film wasn't artificially disturbing or drawn out, and handled the biographical elements with an amazing sensitivity without discounting what was happening either. Yet the film is not depressing or sad. Cullin and Gilliam skillfully blended in lightness and joy for a view of another kind of magical childhood in an amazing, rare film.

The story is about a little girl's fantasy world, but it's not about her world being a fantasy either. There's blurring between what could be seen as brilliant creativity or a form of protective madness; emotional fantasy or twisted reality; resilience or pending breakdown. The story unfolds in a natural, chronological way where later scenes explain the opening. She's rational when her mother dies, which seems natural at the time, but later, when she needs her father, she seems irrational. Her world is upside down and inside out in every way possible. What's usually considered the worst thing that could happen to a child, becomes her surreal life's dream come true instead.

This movie is not meant for everyone. As I said, people idealizing all children have happy lives will hate this film. But for people amazed by children's innate abilities to cope with adversity will relate to the necessity of using fantasy for survival. For others though, this movie might be more disturbing as a reminder when they needed to use an imaginary world that was bigger than the actual events happening at the time.

The studio had interfered to such a degree with Gilliam's vision that it no longer seemed like one of his films at all.  Sadly, this seems to be the pattern whenever Hollywood tries to subvert the influence of a true cinematic genius.  Then word leaked out he was simultaneously working on an independently financed film that would see release soon afterward.  Wow, to say this movie is out there is an understatement.  Taking the basic formula of Lewis Carroll's Wonderland books and twisting them to such a degree as to be almost unrecognizable is no small feat.  We see the tale of Alice through the distorted view of a junkie or other demented individual.  Jeff Bridges as the father stole the show, even as a rotting corpse.  I must say Gilliam goes to some dark places here; necrophilia, pedophilia, child abuse, exploiting the mentally retarded.  The list goes on, but if you can stomach the action, it's quite beautiful in a macabre way, and displays the ""ugly"" beauty Gilliam is capable of.  This film will never reach the acclaim his other works such as Brazil, Time Bandits, or 12 Monkeys will, but it is similar in tone to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, where the central characters go on such a wondrous journey that you can't help but get caught up in it.

Tideland is about a girl whose mother dies from an overdose and her father takes her to where he grew up out in the middle of nowhere and he too dies of an overdose when they get there. But the girl does not realize he is dead, and escapes into a world of her own to deal with it, talking to her dolls, imaging things ... as Terry himself said, ""it's like Alice In Wonderland meets Psycho""

I'm not sure if it's ""Psycho"" it seems more like ""Alice IWL"" meets the ""Devils Rejects""

Along her way she meets a woman named Dell who at first she thinks is a ghost, then thinks she is a witch. And Dells younger retarded brother who she forms an innocent relationship with.

It can be a little disturbing to those who are expecting it to become sexual, but if you really see whats happening here, it's a little innocent girl who has the dream of being beautiful, holding hands, being married, having babies, but does not know how babies are made. And her boyfriend does not seem to know what sex is either, so their kissing is an innocent loved affair that is not sexual, it's from a child's perspective of what lovers do, without even having any knowledge of what the adults really do.

The movie further goes into weirdo mode with Dell preserving the child's father so they can keep him around... weird is all i can say about that.

The things that happen in this movie are too art-house for my liking. It was watchable, but it's just weird. For art-house fans, this is sure to please that audience.

I did not feel the movie was offensive, perverse or sick as some people have said... it's just different and very weird and will appeal to certain audiences and lean towards a boundary that does not get crossed, but puts enough thought into your own mind that you will not be comfortable with it.

I think it's getting more down reviews from Monty Python fans who expected it to be a comedy... but you have to keep in mind, Terry Gilliam was the one who did the animations, not the jokes. So he is the visual member of the pythons, not the funny one. So the comedy is not laugh out loud funny in this movie... but at least he is trying to go down another path that does not rely on huge visual shots never seen before.

It's hard for me to actually pick what I want to rate this movie. 1 star would be I hated it, which I didn't. 2 stars would be I didn't like it, but I did not hate it. 3 stars would be it was ok, and so on... but I'm stuck somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. So don't look at my rating and think I hated the movie.

I can see it it for what it was going for. It's just this movie is not the sort of thing i'm into... but i'm sure the art-house audiences will give it rave reviews. If I thought it was 3 stars and OK, i'd want to see it again, but I don't think I want to see this ever again, but it's not because it's sick or a bad movie, it's just not the sort of thing i'm into.

Some of the bonus features are typical Python humor. You may like some of those, but I did not really want to know anything more about this movie, so the interviews where easily skipped by myself when Terry was not part of them.

Overall, if you love art-house or weird movies, this one is for you. if your looking for a python like comedy or a sweet drama story, this ain't it.",1214956800,,3561,4.1226551226551225
2687500,2,B000KB4898,"Orphaned after the deaths of her drug addicted parents(Jeff Bridges and Meg Tilly), little Jeliza-Rose (Jodelle Ferland) lives in an abandoned country house, with only severed Barbie doll heads and a bizarre brother and sister (Janet McTeer and Brendan Fletcher) for companionship.  Essentially powerless and at the mercy of a bizarre and capricious universe, she develops an increasingly dark fantasy life.

Although Terry Gilliam's extraordinary visual sense is often on display here, it was not enough to save the film for me.  One of the biggest problems is the performance by Ferland, who is simply not up to carrying a major motion picture on her shoulders.  I was also put off by the brother-sister pair, but they run up against a prejudice of mine that may not be shared by other viewers--I am annoyed by characters who are outfitted with so many quirks that they seem less like real people than walking metaphors meant to embody the writer's thematic concerns.  I realize that everything in the film is filtered through the perceptions of this odd and precocious little girl, and if the film had been more compelling I might have been more patient with its problematic aspects.  Because it is such a personal film from an artist who has produced some very interesting work in the past, I cannot bring myself to hate it, but I cannot count myself among its passionate defenders.",1214006400,2,1386,4.927038626609442

A lot of people are questioning why he would attach his name to something so terrible and disturbing and that he is slipping as a director.  This is not true.  The film is not all that disturbing, it has it's moments but nothing really terrible.  The story is strange and only Gilliam would have been able to tell it right. It's flaws lie in it's story, not the direction.  The story itself is very very slow and feels like it doesn't go anywhere.  People even argue that it has no story at all. Well, There is a story and a very deep and meaningful one if you can pull your eyes open a little bit and look deeper into it.  But it is slow and it doesn't really start or end.  The acting is brilliant and the direction is great. Gilliam could have done a little bit more with this film in terms of the story being a little slow, he could have amped up some more cool visual sequences but trust in Gilliam.

When you think of what it takes for movie to get a good rating it has it all including talented actors, a good plot (From the book Tideland) and good direction via Terry Gilliam. It was shot using the super 35 MM process with most outdoor scenes shot using a Twelve MM Wide Angle Lens. The musical score was original and was wonderful. They took full use of Digital Dolby 5.1 technology including wide dynamic range and frequency response. The theme is about a young girl Jeliza-Rose (Jodelle Ferland - about 10 years old in the movie) who was born a crack-baby.  Her  parents eventually die of there drug habits  and she is left alone to shift for herself. The movie was shot from the eyes of this 10 old girl. She has a vivid imagination and puts it to good use by having thoughtful mature conversations with doll heads.  She actually uses her own voice for the doll head conversations. She meets a twenty year old retarded man named Dickens (Brendan Fletcher) who has a mental capacity similar in age to Jeliza-Rose.  Jeliza-Rose has a flirtatious relationship with Dickens but, it does not cross the line. Jodelle is a beautiful, intelligent and talented young actress.  I believe she has a great future in the film industry. After reading other reviews, I agree with others in that you either love it or hate it. I loved it. It will go down as one of my most favorite movies of all time. Each time I watch it I get more out of it.

2687526,4,B000KB4898,"How does childlike innocence and imagination combat he horrors of a mundane and disturbed existence?  This is one of the questions Terry Gilliam attempts to answer in his latest film, Tideland.  Based on the novel by Mitch Cullin, Tideland is a dark trip down the rabbit hole in which we follow a young girl named Jeliza-Rose as she uses her exhaustive imagination to cope with her mother's death, her father's depression and drug abuse and her near isolation in a small house.

Before the film begins, Gilliam warns us that ""a lot of you aren't going to like this film.""  The film's disclaimer is that the film is playing on innocence.  There are many scenes that are quite horrific if it weren't for the main character's naivete.

Before viewing, cast aside any thoughts that is is an average movie.  It is clearly an art film that asks for great leaps of faith by the viewer. The girl's friends are doll's heads who bicker amongst each other and vie for her affection, her best human friend is a mentally retarded teenager, who along with his older sister, comprise of the girl's new ""family"", her old one having been lost to death, drug abuse and depression.

All in all the acting is fantastic and the themes are well developed.  The narrative sometimes takes a dive and the viewer's mind has a tendency to wander as the plot slows down.

I would recommend this film to those who are willing to suspend their disbelief and to veteran Gilliam fans.  This is quite different from his other films, such as Fear and Loathing and Twelve Monkeys, and should be treated as such.  Is it worth watching? Yes. Worth watching repeatedly? Yes, but only if you are a film or art student.  Is it an enjoyable film to watch?

I wouldn't be surprised if she has suffered any ill effects because of this film.  What could be more sick than hugging the very dead, but not only dead, but EMBALMED corpse of your father??  There are lots of sick things in this world, do we really need to see this in the movies??  This movie really had no point to it.  It seemed like a heroin/crack addict/drug addict's nightmare.

  I also think Bridges sunk to a really low point in agreeing to star in this film.  He's better than that, but I'm not so sure now that I've seen him in this film.

2687552,4,B000KB4898,"In most of my comments I try to give a reader objective information with which to determine whether they might like a film and in some cases I point out details to look for during the viewing process. Doing this for ""Tideland"" (2005) is quite a challenge. Personally I really enjoyed the film, but I clearly fall into its relatively narrow target audience and this is one film that does not compromise its vision to expand its viewer base.

The first thing to understand is that this is a horror film, it's not a fantasy adventure or a black comedy (although there are arguably some elements from each genre). Jodelle Ferland, who plays the main character, hit the mark about the casting when she said: ""They like to cast me for scary roles. I think it's because they want you to be scared, but also to like the little girl.""

I think it is a very scary film, probably even scarier for children, many of whom would find it extremely entertaining even though they probably should not be allowed to watch it. Which is a good way to think about the whole thing; it's a film where those likely to connect with it the strongest are not mature enough to view it. Making its valid target audience those who still view much of the world through the eyes of their internal child.

It is an American Gothic version of ""Alice and Wonderland"", and little heroine Jeliza-Rose (Ferland) shares many of Alice's virtues; innocence, courage, curiosity, wonder, kindness, intelligence, courtesy, dignity, and a sense of justice. The main difference is that Jeliza- Rose does not share Alice's irritation with the rude and illogical characters they encounter in their respective wonderlands. Alice is a confident and proper little Victorian girl who expects a certain standard of behavior while Jeliza-Rose is the neglected daughter of two flaming junkies (Jeff Bridges and Jennifer Tilly) who is skilled at making the best of a variety of sucky situations.

""Tideland"" has the look (cinematography) and feel of Terrance Malick's ""Days of Heaven"". Both were made by a director who knew how something felt, and found a way to evoke it in us. It is how a child feels when it lives precariously but knows security and joy for brief periods, and then each time that is taken away wipes off the tears and pretends it doesn't hurt. Both stories are told from the point of view of a young girl. In ""Tideland"", ""Days of Heaven's"" voice-over commentary is replaced by the conversations Jeliza-Rose has with her four dolls (really just the heads of dolls) and a squirrel; in which she supplies the all voices. Jeliza-Rose's point of view is strongly reinforced by a child level camera position. Although the camera techniques call attention to themselves it is all at the service of POV.

Ferland's performance (to Gilliam's acting for the camera direction) was extraordinary and even Oscar worthy. And the power she brings to the juxtaposition of the film's images is an editor's dream. This stuff is the film's most elemental feature and I cannot imagine anyone enjoying the film if they do not connect with it. Fortunately you can predict your connection just by viewing ""Tideland's"" promotional poster, which shows a very tiny Jeliza-Rose sitting on the branch of gnarled tree, the tree is turned upside down against a Grant Wood style background ( or Andrew Wyeth's 1948 ""Christina's World"" painting).

The adult characters are so weird and wild that Jeliza-Rose's inner child sessions with the four dolls' heads she has turned into finger-puppets (Sateen Lips, Glitter Gal, Mystique and Baby Blonde) provide the film's sanest moments.

""Tideland"" is an adaptation of Mitch Cullin's 2000 cult novel. After her mother OD's on a mix of methadone and chocolate, a little girl is taken by her father to his boyhood home, an abandoned farmhouse out on the prairie where the only trace of society is the occasional passing train and a very odd brother and sister who live nearby. Soon left to her own devices the girl entertains herself by exploring her grandmother's house and trying to make friends with the weird neighbors.

Most everything is shown on a gritty realist level, making the occasional fantasy scenes even more effective. In retrospect, the film and the Jeliza-Rose character, channel a lot from ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", with Ferland playing a disquietingly mad version of Mary Badham's Scout and Brendan Fletcher an energetic Boo Radley.

""If it's shocking, it's because it's innocent."" {You'll know what I mean when you see it}. And it is true, you will either love it or you will hate it. It's easy to tell why for both reasons. He directs a very interesting and creative interpretation of Alice in Wonderland. I personally liked it a lot, and it's very interesting to see a modern, twisted version of Wonderland as a child's odd imagination: Throughout Tideland, Jeliza-Rose is kept company by her doll's heads on her fingers while roaming the prarie looking for imaginative adventure. She gets more than she bargained for after meeting some strange people with even stranger intentions. Not only that, but reality becomes ancient history with the stuff she experiences because of her ""over-spontaneous"" imagination and a few squirrels...

Co-screenwriter and director Terry Gilliam has long been fixated on the phantasmagoria of life, the clash of those titanic forces, Id and Ego. And ""Tideland"" is thusly tempest tossed.

Gilliam, with his signature visual sense and non-sense, goes to the jugular of the dichotomy between the brave light we would like ourselves to be, masters of our surroundings and fate, the love and innocence and comfort we wish to hold dear, the desire to be cared for... and the dark dangers and disasters and ghosts and creeping, tragic doubts and failings and frailties in ourselves that can scare us half to death and bring us down and even drive us crazy.

Not all children have rich fantasy lives. Not all children are tested early on by such things as the death of a parent, of abandonment, of surreal confusion, of utter isolation and imagination gone wild. And grown-ups tend to turn away from those fantastical riches of childhood. (Some of those adults have expressed their distaste and distress in other reviews of ""Tideland"".) Gilliam is drawn to characters who DO sink and swim in the deep recesses of the raucous, raging, sensual Id.

""Tideland"" is challenging and, in a few scenes, disturbing. And it is, in many scenes, lovely and lyrical to see. AND it is a test of each viewer. Those who enjoy ""Tideland"" most, I am sure, are liberal, in the overarching sense of the word, glad to see others try, no matter how much they might disagree -- and able to walk a ways in another man's shoes -- as Atticus said to Scout in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" just one literary and artistic reference which comes to mind while watching this film. And ""Alice in Wonderland"" doesn't just appear in the film by chance; this is Gilliam's Alice, who was, we should recall, not only a literary character but also a real little girl, on whom the author Lewis Carroll had a rather taboo crush. Yes, here too, as has been said, taboos abound.

Artistic endeavors often relish tackling taboos, and Gilliam is an old swashbuckler in this vein. He seems to ask: what wonder would heaven be without the horror, the horror of our darkest trials. He doesn't just rattle the skeletons in our closets, he intends to show we ARE those skeletons.

Those viewers who do not shy away from recognizing the fears of youth and being compassionate toward those fears, those who can recall the interplay of fear and relief, of conquering ghosts, of going through hell and being resilient enough to find comfort, to accept love and to come out the other side finding their own sanity both in doubt and enriched, may come to appreciate ""Tideland.""",1185926400,2,2726,4.728421052631579

If he has, it is a child that, between periods of utter neglect, went through some severe physical and emotional abuse.  The camera work and visuals live up to Terry Gilliam standards, but the plot, alas, does not.

2687571,1,B000KB4898,"If you're looking for another Pan's Labyrinth, you're looking in the wrong place. The plot seemed very Pan-ish to me and the fact that Gilliam directed it made it a no brainer. How wrong I was.

Firstly the terrible fake southern accents killed me, the acting wasn't horrible but the way they talked was. I really don't understand why all the characters except for Dickens talked how they did. Incidentally the character Dickens was done very well, but he was the only character I could remotely stand.

The plot itself is rather dull. There are some weird situations, but nothing that I was really drawn to and usually I like weirdness. I was hoping for the immersive imagination of Jeliza-rose but there was only really one or two scenes in the entire movie which were poorly done. This was a low budget film, however I was not aware of that before hand.

Not much really happens in the story, I mean yeah it has weird points but not really enough to keep my interest. There was waaay too much dialog between Jeliza-rose and her dolls, which as you can imagine is intensely boring. This really shouldn't have been made into a movie, it's way too slow-paced and it feels like there's a lot missing (which I'm sure there is). This is a book and probably should have remained as one.

 I can't personally recommend this to anyone because I really thought I was going to like this movie. It sounded good from what I had heard about it, but I ended up really not liking the film. My advice however is that if you are still interested in seeing the movie for whatever reason. Is that you do yourself a favor and rent it instead of buying it. Even if you like it there isn't really any reason to watch it again, its one of those movies that you probably won't want to watch again even if you do like it.",1182384000,6,1798,4.419939577039275

Gilliam has surpassed typical film making (even by his own standards of typical) and created real art. It is a vision of the worst of the adult world, viewed through the best of childhood.  It is dark, grotesque, disturbing, beautiful, surprising, surreal and at its heart ""innocent"".  If you are unfamiliar with Gilliam's work you're better off starting with The Fisher King or Brazil.  But if you're willing to take the time and do a little thinking it's well worth the trip down Gilliam's personal rabbit hole.",1181952000,3,618,4.738317757009346
2687574,2,B000KB4898,"In the brief introduction, a wild eyed Terry Gilliam explains that as a 64 year old filmmaker he finally found his inner child (a little girl) in order to make this movie adaptation of the Mitch Cullin novel. As expected, Terry Gilliam's inner child is not your average suburban milquetoast - but this is really something else. Jeliza Rose lives with her junkie parents in a remote delapidated farmhouse on some namless prairie. A mix up with some methodone/heroin leads to her mother's death at the start of the movie. Her father (Jeff Bridges - think 'The Dude' from The Big Lebowski only several stages more advanced in his stupor) takes her on a brief wild tour, but soon settles back into his soporific routine of 'vacations' - for 90 percent of the movie he is either a corpse, or tantamount to that, mute in his chair with Jeliza periodically assisting him with his torniquet and injections.

So it's fair to say that Jeliza-Rose doesn't have ideal family circumstances. In fact, she is better off once both parents have departed. She is the typical introverted, lonely imaginative child - only much more so. She acts out hollywood actress scenes in front of her mirror, she befriends her headless barbie dolls (and spends interminable amounts of time in the movie talking to them), names fireflies, shudders in the hulk of a ruined car while trains rattle by. Eventually she encounters the just as bizarre Dell, a witch like figure dressed in black, with a beekeepers veil and a bee stung missing pupil in her right eye. Dell adopts the frightened Jeliza-Rose as a dysfunctional surrogate mother, and Jeliza enters into her world, including a friendship with Dell's brother Dicken's, a retarded epileptic who tallies with Jeliza's imaginative games, and even enters into a form of childish, Lolitaesque boyfriend/girlfriend relationship - 'silly kisser' Jeliza giggles when Dickens proffers his trembling lips to hers.

The paedophilia is not the disturbing aspect of the movie. The complete mishmash of ideas and themes, surrealism without much of a moral purpose other than to satisfy Gilliam's curious inner child reclamation. The movie is a classic visual spectacle, with some eye spiralling rapid camera work and visceral detail - especially concerning Jeliza's father's rotting corpse. But there is too much lunacy and not enough sustenance for this to be a really compelling movie.

Once again, Gilliam tries to realise a bizzare vision, and comes short.",1181606400,6,2469,5.046568627450981

2687577,3,B000KB4898,"Of all his films, Terry Gilliam's Tidelands may - here's a prediction - never find an audience - except, of course, for his die-hard fans, and, possibly, fans of the novel. Right from the get-go, during his introduction on the DVD, even Gilliam seems to realize this, and tries to excuse the fact that his low-budget take on Mitch Cullin's dark and disturbing novel just never clicks.

The film follows 9-year old Jeliza-Rose (a pretty amazing performance by Jodelle Ferland), as she gamely struggles through one harrowing trauma after another, her sanity precariously balancing on a bubble-thin lifeline while she cooks up hits for her burnout-junkie ex-rocker dad (Jeff Bridges) and deals with her burnout-junkie mom's insane mood-swings. After Jeliza-Rose witnesses her mother's heroin withdrawal, seizure-fit death, Jeliza-Rose and her dad bolt their trashed apartment, hop on a bus, and head out to her dead grandmother's empty, remote, and decaying old farmhouse.

And then things get really strange.

Jeliza-Rose accidentally sends Dad on another - permanent - heroin-induced vacation, and she slowly loses her marbles; her child's mind hopelessly tries desperately to cope by exploring the creepy old house while chatting with her only friends: four bodiless doll-heads, each a representation of Jeliza-Rose's cracking psyche. Things actually seem to look up a bit when she meets her uber-crazy neighbor, Dell (who, uh, knew Jeliza-Rose's father when they were young, and decides to use her talent with taxidermy to spruce up his bloated, rotting body), and her brain-damaged, explosive-loving brother, Dickens (another pretty amazing performance, by Brendan Fletcher), who becomes Jeliza-Rose's true love. As in the novel, the most truly disturbing images spring from this relationship.

Gilliam and others have described the film (and the novel) as a cross between Psycho and Alice in Wonderland. I'd say it's more like Alice meets the wacky, flesh-eating clan from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Frankly, all that was missing was Leatherface waving around his chainsaw, doing his Leatherface dance while he chases around screaming teenagers.

And then there's this: as highlighted by his world-weary attitude in the DVD's several making of documentaries and cast-and-crew interviews, the simple fact is that Gilliam just doesn't seem to enjoy making movies anymore. Burdened with his reputation as a brilliant visionary/ studio killer, here Gilliam just looks completely burnt-out and almost uncaring, especially during the documentary of his filmmaking process, and is barely more his normal maniacally animated self as he defends his choices during the special feature cast and crew interviews. Granted, Tideland was filmed while he was still working on the underwhelming flop, The Brothers Grimm, and, at 64, Gilliam is no spring chicken, so fatigue obviously plays a part; but beyond the difficult subject matter, Tideland is tedious at best, and the rather low budget is apparent; even Gilliam's trademarked touches: the wide lens shots, the insertion of the fantasy elements (that often seem jarringly out of place here), as well as his admitted obsession with pre-teen girl protagonists (Baron Munchausen, anyone?) all serve to distract rather than pull the viewer in - the death-knell for a film based on what is essentially a character study -- however appalling that character's life may be. And as hard as he might try to convince us otherwise, even Gilliam finding his 'inner child' isn't enough for a good film make.",1179705600,10,3538,5.390596745027125

2687583,3,B000KB4898,"Based on the novel of the same name by Mitch Cullin, Tideland is a beautiful and disturbing look into the mind of a little girl with the strangest lifestyle ever put on the screen. The opening sets the tone of the rest of the film: Terry Gilliam, in black and white, explains that many people will find his film too disturbing and not like it. He may be right, but others will love it.

When 11-year-old Jeliza-Rose's mother (a frighteningly cracked-out Jennifer Tilly) dies of a heroin overdose, she flees with her father (an equally cracked out Jeff Bridges) on a Greyhound bus to an old abandoned house in west Texas. Soon after, Jeliza-Rose's father meets the same fate as her mother, leaving her alone (except for her playmates: four barbie-doll heads she wears on her fingers and converses with) in the middle of nowhere.

This is when she meets her new neighbors: Dell, a witchlike woman with a fear of bee-stings, and her mentally retarded brother Dickens, who wears flippers and scuba gear in order to ""swim"" through the grass fields. Dickens also hunts the giant ""shark"" that comes down the railroad tracks.

If this sounds like the kind of story you're intersted in, then jump right in. The cinematography is gorgeous and every frame is stunning. The way the movie flows is comparable to how Jeliza-Rose's disturbed mind interprets it all.  Because of this flow, at times the movie seems to drag. The plot doesn't feel to be moving along. What's strange is that the result of this turns out to attract as much as repel. Viewers can find themselves pulled into this twisting, tumbling world that Jeliza-Rose lives in, or find themselves pushing away when the situation becomes too disturbing.

There are parts that are downright painful to watch, but they are presented with such blatant naivete that it almost feels as if the normalcy of the situation is taken for granted by both the characters and the filmmakers, which is a strange sensation to behold.

There is an entire second disc of extras, including a short film entitled ""Getting Gilliam"" which provides insight into the mind of Terry Gilliam. Chances are, after watching Tideland, you may have had enough of his mind for a while, but there's some interesting stuff there. Tideland is a poignant, beautiful film, but probably not one you'll want to watch again and again.",1175472000,4,2342,4.813432835820896

What could be funnier that Jeff Bridgess playing aged Dude to the extreme, part II - ""Duddy takes vacation to the point of no return""?  Or Jennifer Tilly as a caricature of Courtney Love? Unpleasant? Very much so. Original?  The director himself called his movie, ""Alice in Wonderland meets Psycho"" and these are just two references of many. You can name all novels, short stories or the movies about the little girls escaping their dreadful realities in the world of their imagination as well as  ""Wizard of Oz"", Tennessee Williams' plays, Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"" and one of the most stunning screen adaptations of ""Alice in Wonderland"", Jan Svankmajer's ""Alice"". Gilliam in ""Tideland"" borrows from them or rather meditates on the same themes, using his unique tools, and bringing his unique vision and talent in the familiar harrowing story of a child lost.

The movie is technically superb and visually arresting - it must be. If anything, Terry Gilliam is known as one of the most talented and wildly imaginative modern filmmakers, the true eccentric. He describes himself better than anyone ever would:

""There's a side of me that always fell for manic things, frenzied, cartoony performances. I always liked sideshows, freakshows. ...Absolutely grotesque, awful, tasteless. I like things to be tasteless.""

I guess, whether you'd like ""Tideland"" or not, would depend a lot on your sharing his fondness for the things ""absolutely grotesque, awful, tasteless"" - there are plenty of them in ""Tideland"" yet strangely it is tender and sad, and in its best moments undeniably brilliant. Often called modern fairy tale for adults, the movie fits perfectly the description. Fairy tales, the unabridged versions of them are often scary, graphic, disturbing, violent, bloody, gory...and fascinating.  Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Anderson - his ""Little Mermaid"" is one of the saddest, even tragic tales ever written"". Oscar Wilde's fairy tales, ""Arabian Nights"" - the real thing, not the adaptations for the children; myths and legends of ancient Greece - the myth of two brothers, Atreus and Thyestes, the story of Oedipus - that's pure horror and tragedy. Well, back to the Gilliam's fairy tale. Did I like it? I don't know. What I do know that the very last shot of the movie, the one which supposed to symbolize the happy ending, that of the girl's face from the angle that distorts her features turning the angelic face into the sinister cynical mask that could belong to the creature of the darkest nightmares and with two huge black holes of eyes is the most horrifying one in the movie which is packed with the scenes of horror. None of them is as disturbing, unsettling and memorable as this face - happy end according Terry Gilliam.",1174953600,8,2858,5.0423728813559325
2687585,5,B000KB4898,"Tideland is the 10th film by Director Terry Gilliam ( Brazil, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, 12 Monkeys).  Gilliam adapted this film from the Novel of the same title, written by Mitch Cullin. The Movie is prefaced with a short monologue by Gilliam telling the viewer that most people will not like this film and many will hate it.  Its a specialty film that was not made for the masses.  He also said this entire movie is skewed from reality and is told through the eyes and perspective of a child. At the end of the day Gilliam does care if you enjoyed the film, as long as after you see it it makes you think.  With that said the film is nor confusing or as shocking as one might think at first viewing.  Tideland does not adhere to a formula or follow an adults logical conclusion.  Not many movies these days can you watch and really have no idea what direction its going to go in.

Now its not just a movie with random scenes that don't really fit into the bigger narrative structure of the story or of a conventional told story, it certainly has all those character elements transitions, and climax a movie needs to be entertaining.  This movie defiantly satisfies my hunger for rich and interesting characters.  Tideland is the smallest of Gilliams other projects, completely independent, free from any studio involvement, so the scale is much small and much more intimate which servers to the advantage of a story like this one.

The main character is Jaliza-Rose, a nine year old child that has to tend to her junkie parents (Jennifer Tilly and Jeff Bridges) she helps ready her fathers Heroine injections and tends to he belligerent mothers whims and mood swings till one day her mother drops dead, Anna Nicole style.  Jeliza and her father then pack up and leave to an old farm house that her father, Noah (Played by Bridges, who is a washed up rock star) bought for his now dead mother. The house is old, run down and in the middle of nowhere surrounded by fields of wheat and grain. This is a direct contrast from Jeliza-Roses urban upbringing.

Despite these never ending struggles and horrible situations she is forced to deal with, Jeliza-Rose is a very spirited and fun loving little girl.  She uses her imagination to escape these horrors of her reality.  She makes believe and escapes with help from her four imaginary friends that are old doll heads she wears on her fingers.  They all have different personalities that mirror her true feeling, one is pretty, and smart and confident, one is disfigured and ugly, one is very scared and one is just a stupid supermodel type, not really knowing whats going on.  .

This film is sweet, and yet disturbing. Gilliam touches on a lot of Taboos dealing with a young girl that have many people thinking he crossed the line.  This film is not gory and there is no real acts of violence in it but some of the images will shock you and many moments of suspense that really make you feel terror for this child.  Gilliam has tagged this movie Alice in wonderland meets Psycho. its a very fitting description.

The movie is carried by the young actress playing the lead named Jodelle Ferland.  She is in almost every shot in the movie and has many speaking parts using different voices and accents.  She blows away anything that hack Dakota Fanning ever did.  Why, because shes not playing a nine year old, she is being a nine year old.  So many young actresses are playing more grow up then a child would act in those situations.  Another notable performance is by Brendan Fletcher who played the mentally inept Dickens who befriends young Jelliza-Rose.  His performance is so moving I had to look to see if he was really mental deficient, hes that good, (I am Sam and Forest Gump, eat your heart out). The movie is really about the resiliency of a child to cope with terrible things and how a child can endure and survive, sometimes much better than an adult.  Its about a child using her imagination to try to understand things that no child should ever have to deal with.

There are so many other elements like religious hypocrisy that are touched open very briefly without being over explained or thrown in your face.  It gets you thinking instead of telling you what to think like in such acclaimed Hollywood films like Crash that critics thought was so poignant and relevant but it nowhere in the film did it leave anything subjective or open ended, this behavior is good and this behavior is bad, Not in this film

Gilliam is one of my favorite directors working today and is one of the most creative since the likes of Kubrick. Critics hated, I mean hated this movie.  I couldn't believe when it came out late last year that it was received so poorly, it almost scared me away, thank good I learned a while ago that most critics are not worth the price of the word processing software they use to write their reviews.

I cant fault all of them for not liking this movie and Im sure there will be at least one person who reads this review that goes and watches it and says what a stupid movie and you know, thats ok.  Its one of those personal films that I like knowing that not everyone will enjoy it this movie is a delight to watch and I have no problem popping it in a getting engrossed in the story and characters over and over again.  If you're open minded to a unique film or you can say you're a Gilliam fan youll walk away with something from this film.",1174953600,11,5427,4.492871690427698

2687587,4,B000KB4898,"Terry Gilliam is best known for his acting, directing, and writing within the Monty Python troupe. Mention his name in comedic circles and instantly you'll hear titles like THE LIFE OF BRIAN and MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL or maybe even the cultish BRAZIL.

But more likely than not you've never heard of TIDELAND, which is unfortunate because it's a very good film. Not Mr. Gilliam's best directorial achievement, but certainly highly entertaining and grossly underrated. Receiving only a limited release in 2005, Tideland was quickly whisked out of theaters in favor of bigger blockbusters that held minimal substance by comparison.

What else is interesting is the perfect casting and surprising comeuppance of eleven-year-old Jodelle Ferland who appears in nearly every frame of the film. Side by side with such veterans as Jeff Bridges (THE BIG LEBOWSKI) and Jennifer Tilly (MONSTERS, INC.), Ferland's performance was hilarious, sad, and openly weird.

The story itself would've been intriguing enough, even without the great actors, in that it exposes the psyche of a young girl named Jeliza-Rose (Ferland) who must deal with the unpredictable, drug-addled behavior of her short-lived parents Queen (Tilly) and Noah (Bridges). She handles it by seeking solace in her imagination. When her mother dies, her father takes her on ""an adventure"" (think Alice In Wonderland) that carries her back to her father's vacant home in the middle of nowheresville. When her father decides to take a heroin ""vacation"", Jeliza-Rose is left on her own, playing with her bodiless dolls, finding a rabbit hole, and eventually stumbling upon a brain-damaged friend named Dickens (the PERFECTLY cast Brendan Fletcher, RV).

Finding a friend, no matter how psychologically damaged he may be, Jeliza-Rose and Dickens form an intricate if fatalistic bond. Dickens believes the trains that run near his home to be a type of ""shark"" that patrol the ocean-like fields of wheat that span the nearby plains. His attempts to destroy this shark are poignantly funny in that he leaves coins on the railroad tracks in an attempt to ""sicken"" or derail the creature. Jeliza-Rose, joining his fantasy into her own world, creates a barrier in her own mind to distance herself from death, and it is so dark and so funny that viewers will find it amazing that they're laughing at her circumstances.

Pushing boundaries is what good and great cinema is all about, and it certainly is what this film does. Tickling that dark funny bone while tugging heartstrings is probably one of the toughest things directors and actors can do, but Gilliam and his crew pulled it off without a hitch. The dark tonality of the production mixed extremely well with the comedic events that Jeliza-Rose inserts in order to protect herself.

If I had to describe it in terms of other movies, I'd say it's GUMMO goes into PAN'S LABYRINTH, with maybe a little PINK FLAMINGOS thrown in... but that really doesn't begin to describe it.

I think what this film does beautifully is to show us the wonder of childhood, and its adaptable fantasy, even when the reality surrounding that child is grim and psychotic.  I always expected that the film would become an outright fantasy, but the film  stays in the realm of the possible.  The fantasy is all in the little girl's mind: how she recreates the world around her in her head, with her conversations with her imaginary friend doll heads, and with her fantastic embellishments of conversations with the demented and disturbed characters surrounding her.

Gilliam has created a beautiful fantasy out of a heinous and shocking reality.  Out of all the films by Gilliam I've seen, I believe that this one is the most original and innovative, and the truest to his creative vision.",1174435200,6,1068,4.797814207650274
2687589,4,B000KB4898,"Terry Gilliam has always made astoundingly weird movies, from his little Monty Python cartoons to the classic ""Brazil."" Nobody knows how to combine childlike wonder with creepy darkness.

So it doesn't exactly startle that he's tackled Mitch Cullin's southern gothic novel, and turned it into an eerie sort of ""Brazil-Meets-Alice-In-Wonderland."" It lacks much of a cohesive plot, but Gilliam can still make a creepy, exquisite storyline that takes place half in the weirdness of this world, half in a little girl's head.

When her crazed mother ODs and dies, Jeliza-Rose (Jodelle Ferland) and her washed-up dad Noah (Jeff Bridges) move to a decrepit Texas farm. But like most junkies, Noah soon dies as well. Jeliza-Rose seems to go into denial, letting her father's body sit in the house as she explores the rippling grass -- like a sea -- around her house, spinning a series of dreamlike fantasies.

She's accompanied by four doll's heads and a variety of fantastical visions, all to help her cope with her loneliness. But then she befriends the child-man Dickens (Brendan Fletcher) and his eccentric sister Dell (Janet McTeer). A darker side starts to creep into Jeliza-Rose's world, as Dickens' vendetta against the Monster Shark leads to disaster.

Terry Gilliam has basically made a career out of being weird, and all the movies he's made reflect that. Sometimes his movies are absolutely brilliant (""Brazil""), and sometimes it's just average (""Brothers Grimm""). It's too soon to judge how ""Tideland"" will be remembered, but I'm thinking that it will be remembered as one of Gilliam's most moving films.

The plot is pretty simple -- incomprehensible to those expecting a ""normal"" story -- but it sort of drifts off after Noah's demise. It would have been nice to have a bit more complexity there.  But Gilliam does keep it afloat by relying mostly on Jeliza-Rose's imagination to keep the story going, sort of like Alice in Wonderland did.

Gilliam has always been great at surreal stuff, and he has all sorts here -- talking squirrels, the talking doll-heads, a house sinking into the earth, and a guy who prowls around the prairie in SCUBA gear. Even the landscape -- golden seas of grass, gnarled trees -- has a weird, unearthly look.

But for all this whimsy, Gilliam keeps his eye on the dark side of things -- Jeliza-Rose is trying to escape the horrors of her reality, through a sort of controlled madness. Even when she returns to reality, she won't be able to escape the death and sorrow -- so maybe a little madness is necessary to keep sane.

Jodelle Ferland deserves a special shout-out, especially since she's the center of the entire movie. Her Jeliza-Rose is a wonderful kid -- precocious, intelligent, creative and surprisingly innocent considering that we see her prepping heroin for her dad. But she's still a child, with all of a child's vulnerabilities and fears, and Ferland makes us feel that as well.

""Tideland"" is not a fun movie -- it's disturbing, macabre, and very funny, with some charmingly whimsical visuals. Hate it, love it, but nobody will be on the fence about it.",1174262400,4,3106,4.932950191570881
2687590,3,B000KB4898,"The movie is original, to say the least. I haven't read the novel, but the woman who preserves people close to her, and the epileptic boy who envisions him captain of the wheat fields, are shockingly hysterical. I had fun watching the movie, just for pure shock value, and I do think it is creative. But I won't ever watch it again. I wouldn't say it has any repeat value. Now, as for Gilliam's 12 Monkeys, I could watch a film like that anytime.",1174176000,2,446,4.321428571428571

Do yourself a favor and avoid this sad disaster. When a director opens the film saying there will be people who will hate this film he knows what he's talking about. What is worse is that he says there will be many that will love it. That's scary. As for the people he hope's will at least be thinking about it, well he doesn't want to know.",1174089600,4,480,4.172043010752688
2687592,4,B000KB4898,"It's better than average, it wasn't fantastic. I can understand that a lot of people didn't like it. It would be horrifying if that's how our heroin reacted, but she's not phased by the world she's in and neither was I. Maybe some of the imagery was too subtle, maybe I wasn't paying enough attention. It's not something I'd force on people, but it covers an aspect of the world that isn't usually addressed. There are kids in bad situations who just get on with life, kids are tough little survivors who learn to be fragile adults.",1173744000,4,532,4.494845360824742

A too too too realistic vision of 'litle girl' lost  surrounded by trailertrash and savants and their weirdest performance by Janet McTeer - something I would not wish on my worst victim ..... but it all makes sense.

2687595,5,B000KB4898,"I've been a fan of Mitch Cullin's book for years now, so I was a bit skeptical about Gillam's ability to pull off a good adaptation of such a singular, inward tale.  However, I'm pleased to say that this film, while lacking the all-important first-person narrative of the book and some of the more important restraint of the narrative, is PURE GENIUS.  It will take years for the world to catch up with this film and for good reason:  the world is a too narrow in its artistic vision and scope these days to even brave what the director has served up.  Gilliam has taken a very personal novel by one of the best unsung gay American novelists and turned it into a very personal film by a decidedly unique filmmaker.  Bravo!",1172966400,9,722,4.4393939393939394
2687596,1,B000KB4898,"Here are my top 3 reasons NOT to watch this DVD:

1. Some of the worst-written and most unrealistic dialog to grace the big screen in years.

2. Horrible accents and bad acting. Please- it would be better not to even attempt accents than to subject us to this stuff.  Anyone who has ever lived in America (well outside of Hollywood) should know better!

3. Cheesy camera work straight out of some '90s MTV program. I thought we were past that silly slanted-camera stuff.

I am not even criticizing the subject matter of the film or the plot, just the insulting way the material is delivered.

I can't fathom how this is currently rated 4 stars! Please do yourself a favor and look for other reviews elsewhere before buying.",1172966400,6,723,4.565891472868217
2687597,1,B000KB4898,"This region 1 dvd really dropped the ball.  The correct aspect ratio of the movie is 2.35:1, which is a dramatically wide picture.  This dvd is 1.85:1, which has quite a bit of the picture cropped off.  Nowhere on the package does it mention this, so if you're thinking you're getting to see the movie the way Gilliam intended, you are not.  I can think of no reason this was done, and it is a true disservice to anyone who purchases this dvd.  I hope a new edition is released in the future, but this version is a total waste of money.",1172880000,124,536,4.215686274509804

2687599,5,B000KB4898,"WELL, THIS'S IT, only swirled with near-psychedelic images (beautifully shot) and a bizarre, unsettling and confounding story and characters seldom seen on screen. Akin to CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, it's touching and scary at the same time. Taboos abound.

Tideland is insane. Delusional. Disturbing. Frequently dizzying. Made to be more felt than understood. It left me roiling over its strange characters, images and (maybe) hidden meanings. Shed your preconceptions and prejudices, expect to be frustrated and confused; but in the end you'll feel more stirred than shaken. It's definitely a see and re-see to be appreciated kinda movie. (And definitely a love-it or hate-it movie. Totally formula-less.)

Perhaps it meant to be so-overtly over-the-edge; maybe Genius Gilliam unleashed his visual and conceptual elegance so extravagantly to reach raw depths. Maybe he was on something; whatever, this is an Experience. Good luck.",1172707200,65,927,5.567375886524823

8155307,5,B000KB4898,"If you are contemplating wether or not you should purchase this film, I am here to tell you that it is well worth it. Despite the eerie and disturbing situations involving a child, it is an extremely relatable narrative filled with wonder, awe and excitement told through the eyes of an innocent little girl. This film is not for everyone, and indeed, not all audiences will genuinely appreciate the artistry that Gilliam presents. The acting is superb, and Jodelle Ferland is positively radiant in her role as the Alice in wonderland inspired Jeliza Rose. The score is whimsical and haunting, and the cinematography is bold and artistic, with feverish sweeping shots of the gorgeous rolling farm scenery that really sets the tone of this dismal fairytale. The events that unfold in the story of Jeliza Rose, on this particular summer, are indeed tragic, however the film teaches us a remarkable life lesson. Sometimes it takes a tragedy to save someone from a tragedy they are already enduring. Hands down, my most favorite movie ever.",1523145600,,1036,4.959770114942529
