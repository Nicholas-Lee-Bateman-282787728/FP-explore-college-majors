7997746,4,B0000AOWL9,I use the Ranger workout as a suplimental workout.  Its a good workout to get the blood flowing in the early morning but I would not rely totally on it alone.  I will do the Ranger w/o or USMC Sempre fit w/o on the morning of my weight training days as a suppliment.  It gets the blood flowing and revs up the metabolism. The calisthenics are at a dynamite pace so fall in and get some!,1204416000,2,386,4.052631578947368
7997747,4,B0000AOWL9,"Great workout...for those of you who are looking for a challenging way to spend your time.  If you expect to see instructors prancing around a studio to pop music--skip this video.  However, if you like cadences and very strenuous ab/chest/arm workouts, look no further.  You'll need a place to do dips and pull-ups in order to complete the entire workout, but even if you don't have those items available, you won't be dissapointed!",1112054400,10,433,4.904109589041096
