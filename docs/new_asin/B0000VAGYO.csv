8003510,5,B0000VAGYO,"""Consequence"" is an especially imaginative and intricate movie.  The movie is unique in that Armand Assante plays two parts in the movie, sometimes, both parts in the same scene.  As a disgraced dentist, Assante takes a job as a forensic dentist in a morgue.  He then gets a brilliant idea to overcome his problems.  He assumes another person's identity, the identity of his dead brother.  But there are many twists and turns in this movie that allow the plot to weave a story of great eloquence, suspense and mystery.  Along the way, many interesting lessons are imparted to the viewers and the characters.  This movie gets a 5 star rating without any hesitiation.

Assante is particularly talented her and I have never seen him do a better job of acting in any of his other movies.  Philosophically as well, Assante brings so much to this picture that it is perhaps the crowning achievement of his movie making career.  If intrigue, action, money, mayhem, murder and mystery are your kind of thing, you cannot go wrong with this movie.  While this movie is available in both digital and DVE, BLU RAY and other mediums, one should pick the best choice for themselves.  But it is one of those movies not to be missed.

The subject matter is a bit mature.  The movie is suggested for viewers between the ages of 16 and 110+.  If you feel that this description sounds like a movie you would like to watch, this movie will fill that need, even isntantly, as it is available from Amazon as a streaming video which can be purchased for a very low cost and at the prsent time, is FREE for PRIME Amazon Members.  Do not miss the opportunity to see this fine piece of cinematic portrayal of so many things, in just one motion picture.",1426118400,,1726,4.5732899022801305
8003511,1,B0000VAGYO,"10 minutes into this film is enough to see that it will continue to be bad through to the end.  I wished I had trusted my initial judgement, but was hoping for improvement.  The silly gimmick of not showing the lead character's face was just one tip.  Assante and Shroeder cashed a check, but couldn't save this awful film.",1342137600,,323,4.440677966101695
8003512,2,B0000VAGYO,"Perhaps one might predict the impact of this German production by director Anthony Hickox by looking at some of the other films he has directed such as, ""Stormcatcher,"" ""Jill the Vampire,"" ""Submerged,"" & ""Blast.""  Armand Assante who's played in some great films like ""Paradise Alley,"" ""Private Benjamin"" & ""The Mambo Kings"" plays two brothers.  The film's plot is a bit of a mishmash as dentist Max Taylor apparently made a mistake that caused his dental license to be revoked.  Without income, he's relegated to pulling teeth from corpses in a morgue to assist in false identity scams.  One of these is his own as he stages his own death in a plane accident to get out of the clutches of a demanding wife who wants to drain away all of his remaining assets and them divorce him.  Max has an affair with Eva, Lola Glaudini of TV's ""Criminal Minds.""  She works at a bank and will help with fund transfers.  Unfortunately, Lola has a little AC/DC action going on with Max's ex-wife and doublecrosses him on $3,000,000 in insurance payouts.  Max meanwhile has headed to South America and has clandestine plastic surgery paid for with who-knows-what funds since the $3 million figure never seems to waiver and comes out looking like his brother Sam Taylor.  Unbeknownst to Max, Sam was a dirty CIA operative who scammed $250,000,000 from the government and has top CIA officials very nervous since Sam could bring them down with the information he has.  So when Max returns looking like Sam, people come out of the woodwork to try to kill him.  Bodies mount up as the bright light of the film, ex-agent John Wolf played by Rick Schroeder turns up to save him.  Max doesn't know John since he was Sam's partner (confused, yet?), but finds himself re-teamed with Eva after his ex gets whacked in a hotel room by CIA.  Together, they try to scam John, which winds up working okay as John accidentally blows his brains out.  Schroeder's CIA agent John Wolf has humor, drives some great car chase scenes up and down the stairs of a bank that looks like the national reserve, and ultimately the film dies with him.  However, like a zombie in motion, the shutter still rolls as Max is taken to a lighthouse tower in which his brother Sam who was not dead has killed most of the CIA badguys and leaves Eva chained near a bomb at the top of the tower.  Max escapes, but Eva runs back for the 3 mil only to be blown up in the climactic lighthouse explosion.  The films ends sadly with Assante on a lonely Chilean beach by himself.  Rather than ""Consequence,"" another title for this film might be ""Convoluted.""  The action moves fast enough.  If you're willing to leave your brain behind, you can enjoy this German B flick.
