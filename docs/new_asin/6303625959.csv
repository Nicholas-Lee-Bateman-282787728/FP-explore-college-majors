689435,5,6303625959,"I love this movie brings me to being a kid at summer camp. Micheal J. Fox and Nancy McKeon are really good.  I can't watch it because I don,t have VCR. I don't want to risk a VCR eating it up either.  Please somebody put on DVD.",1319328000,,228,3.8297872340425534
689436,5,6303625959,This movie takes me back to my childhood. It's fun and my children loved it as well. I love Nancy McKeon and Michael J. Fox. Jump back into the eighties and have fun!,1281052800,2,166,4.0606060606060606
689437,5,6303625959,"I picked this movie up at a discount store years and years ago.
In fact, it's one of my only reasons to hold on to a VCR.

Michael J. Fox plays a camp counselor with his eyes set on Nancy McKeon's camp nurse.
Other plots center around the campers in Fox's bunk.  We have the introverted writer, the fat kid, the golden boy, the sports star...
It's a seriously charming movie.  It's as dumb as any made-for-TV production is, but there's so much delight inserted into this movie that it falls into the category of movies like The Goonies and Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  If you grew up with it, the movie holds so much importance that it's hard to forget - or even think critically about.

I wish this movie would get released on DVD.  But in the meantime, at least it's out there on VHS.",1264982400,8,788,4.29054054054054
689438,5,6303625959,"A great, feel good movie for the whole family.  And yes, totally 80's ;o)",1252627200,2,73,4.214285714285714
7851499,4,6303625959,"This is one that should be available on DVDS and if you didn't see this growing up, it's a shame. Although, to be fair, you had to have been a kid in the 80s to really appreciate the whole thing. There are no iPads, no ear buds and the characters are not checking their cell phones every two minutes because they, thankfully, have not been invented yet. Michael J. Fox is a counselor at a summer camp in network TV's answer to Meatballs. While there, he meets and falls for Nancy McKeon and that's when things start coming unglued. It's a lot of fun but it's mainly enjoyable to watch Fox in what was probably his last small screen production. He's firing on all cylinders and unbeknownst to him, will shortly explode onto the big screen in a little film called Back To The Future.",1466812800,,781,4.393103448275862

7851502,5,6303625959,"Remember ""back in time"" when you could tape things off of TV onto VHS? I was IN LOVE with MJ Fox. Naturally, The Facts of Life was one of my favorite shows too so I was excited to see these too coupled up. I must have watched this one 100 times and it definitely stands the test of time. A classic family flick I wish they would put on BluRay so I could cherish it forever!",1397260800,4,373,3.9210526315789473
7851503,5,6303625959,"This made for tv movie has held up so well since it was first shown and additionally it's one of Micheal J Fox's best films.

Unlike other summer camp themed films that focus on largely unsupervised precocious kids or camp counselors who could care less about the campers, often acting like they don't exist, Poison Ivy manages to present a love story for the counselors and some of the best kid heavy scenes ever filmed for a camp movie, both on their own and with the adults.

The scenes involving Timmy the constant runaway who finally makes friends, rises above his challenges and inspires the entire camp to revolt against the 'color war', win at all costs separation mentality are particularly high caliber, and the puppy love (and at one point intentionally poison ivy) infected ten year old poet scenes with McKeon's nurse character are charming and smile inducing as ever.

There's tons of lessons within the storyline that drive the film and never appear sappy, preachy or overdone. From recognizing who your real friends are, to not betraying them and standing by them when they need you most, to seeing challenges as something to overcome than something to stumble over, Poison Ivy is rich with the rewards of lessons learned during the tween years which make those years what they truly are: a major learning experience.

Only 'Big Irv' (played by a seriously over-acting Robert Klein) puts only the slightest damper on what is otherwise the best ever, definitive summer camp movie that will literally delight everyone of all ages.

If you're looking for a camp movie with lots of heart, enjoyable characters-both adults and kids- then you definitely can't go wrong with Poison Ivy.

While I didn't purchase the VHS version, I was lucky enough to find a supplier (not on amazon) who had transferred the film from a pristine vhs copy to dvd. There are none of the vhs visual artifacts usually present in vhs and the sound is outstanding.",1381104000,2,1949,4.837837837837838
7851504,3,6303625959,"I cannot believe this comedy classic is stuck on VHS. It is a great Michael J. Fox vehicle about summer camp kids. It focuses on the kids so it reminded me a lot of The Goonies. There is also a budding romance between Fox and his co-star Nancy McKeon (Facts of Life). I watched it a long time ago and it inspired me to attend summer camp. It was only a TV movie but it was so much fun to watch. The vendor will also provide a DVD copy when you order this VHS tape. This is completely unrelated to the Alyssa Milano/Drew Barrymore Poison Ivy series. Since it is long out of print, a Blu-ray with 2 hours of bonus content would be awesome but perhaps I'm dreaming. This is a 4 star film in a 3 star package. The VHS tape has managed to keep its value.",1378857600,2,749,4.033557046979865
7851505,3,6303625959,"No problem with the movie itself (love it) but the VHS tape I received was apparently damaged or at least bad quality & doesn't play without a lot of unresolvable tracking issues & some other worriesome qualities.  The seller may've been aware of this though since they provided a DVD copy as well, which played perfectly, so it all worked out.",1373241600,,344,4.639344262295082
