8235424,5,B000ZH29IE,I love this entire series of dvd magazines and am sorry that production of them stopped.  They are fascinating and give a glimpse into so many different areas of the art world.  Very entertaining and informative.,1366156800,,212,4.861111111111111
8235425,5,B000ZH29IE,"This is a great format to ""meet"" artists and share their artistic visions.  I am a big fan of Nick Bantock, and just loved hearing him speak and show his work.
