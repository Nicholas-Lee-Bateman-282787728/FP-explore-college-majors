2530843,5,B000ERVJKO,But fortunately it's right around the corner and I can't wait to have all the seasons. Hope it doesn't take an eternity to release the rest.,1143417600,7,140,4.423076923076923
2530844,5,B000ERVJKO,"Nyuk, nyuk.  Seriously, Will Smith as James West?  I want some of whatever it was they were smoking when they thought up that casting - or the idea to even attempt to make this great series into a movie ""for today's audiences"".  Whatever it is they were smoking, it should be off limits to Hollywood filmmakers.

There's not much to add to other reviews regarding the show.  It helps to have lived back in 1965 to know how new and groundbreaking ""The Wild, Wild West"" really was.  The action scenes were first-rate compared to most of what was on the boob-tube at the time, and the show had a distinct eerie atmosphere about it, with the photography and background music giving it almost the feel of a Gothic western.  The harpsichord, the psychedelic electric sitar and tablas, mixed with the western elements was a singular concoction.  Not to mention one of the all-time best theme songs, with the great goddess Carol Kaye (Beach Boys ""Pet Sounds"" album, ""Calif Girls"", Glen Campbell's ""Wichita Lineman"", ""Mission: Impossible"" and too many other TV theme songs to name) doing those great bass guitar riffs.

I will correct a prior review regarding Ross Martin's health problems.  In 1968, during the filming of ""The Night of Fire and Brimstone,"" a show influenced by the then recent discoveries of Japanese soldiers on small Pacific islands still believing WW2 was still on, Martin was ironically playing a sick doctor when he started having problems on the set. The following day, August 17th, 1968, he suffered a major heart attack.  So it was later in the series when that happened.

Also, although the absence of Martin likely resulted in lower ratings (as did the general decrease in the popularity of westerns as the 1960's came to an end), Dr. Frank Stanton, then President of CBS, ordered the program off the air anyway in 1970 due to his pledge to Congress to reduce violence on TV.  Once again, the criminals in Congress at work.  They've only gotten more criminal as time goes on.  I have heard Robert Conrad refer to this more than once in interviews, with appropriate disdain.  Peace and love on the TV screens, but the boys dying in 'Nam for nothing?  Well, that's OK.  Damn, I hate members of Congress. There is a special place in Hell awaiting nearly all of you.

All I can say is, bring back that lovin' feelin' that I used to get seeing James West kick ass.  And send him to Washington while you're at it.",1143158400,15,2426,4.67688679245283
2530845,5,B000ERVJKO,"Finally, the Wild Wild West is getting it's due and being released on DVD. What took so long? This is without a doubt one of the best series ever on television. True escapism with great acting by Conrad and Martin. I just got an advance copy and it is worth it for the extras. Robert Conrad introduces each episode, the original lost pilot, the scoring of the theme song, interviews with key executives, the only TV appearance (on a talk show) by Conrad and Martin, original story boards, and Martin character caricatures done by him. Unfortunately, Conrad doesn't appear on camera and it is audio only. It must be due to his recent accident. He also sounds weak and frail in the intros. But.....they all add up to a great package we've waited 40 years for!",1143072000,7,757,4.573529411764706
2530846,5,B000ERVJKO,"As a previous reviewer wrote--DO NOT confuse this with the movie starring Smith/Kline. This is best compared as a Western Avengers. Conrad/Martin had the same chemistry as Macnee & Riggs and the show mixed real secret agent stuff with a Sci Fi twist. Suspense always built and the music and 'picture frame' stuff at the end of each segment were classic. Adventure, mystery, intrigue, spooky, gadgets-- all for the protection of our country! This and the Avengers are my top 2 shows of the era and nothing touches these classics today.",1142899200,,534,4.8791208791208796
2530847,5,B000ERVJKO,"One of the all-time great TV series finally makes its DVD bow. ""Wild Wild West"" remains a classic in television history -- a truly unique show. The upcoming DVD set is a must-have.",1142899200,6,180,4.484848484848484
2530848,5,B000ERVJKO,"The Wild Wild West was a landmark series in the 1960s. Only two other series from the Sixties stands out in my mind and that is ""Star Trek"" and ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."". I find it fascinating the two best, TWWW and Star Trek, had main characters with the name James and middle initial T. Their cast, directing, writers, music, and the rest the ingredients made these series ahead of their time and unforgettable. Although there had been a couple other secret agent TV shows before TWWW like Danger Man aka Secret Agent Man and Avengers and several that followed it, it was unique in it's approach. Slightly techie for the old West but not overly unrealistic. Several of the devices shown were actually used around that historical period, just watch the history channel. They obviously did their research and tried to keep it somewhat plausible. Certainly not as politically correct or ridiculously implausible as the Will Smith movie, there is no comparison. Robert Conrad and Martin Ross were outstanding as the lead roles and the guest stars where a who's who of current stars for that time period. Many unknowns in it went on to gain stardom. Robert Conrad doing his own stunts made the show more impressive since even us kids could spot stunt doubles easy enough in most series. A couple good reviews here will actually give you the details of the stars since they are obvious fans themselves. It will be good to see those animated drawings duplicate the scene just before a commercial break, but no commercials. Michael Dunn and the rest the villians in this series were masterfully done. Dunn as Miguelito Loveless in particular was excellent and actually made you think about what he was, a complicated man. Unlike previous bad guys there was no black and white easy answer to stopping him. He wanted to accomplish good things, he just had the wrong way of going about it. This set is a must have not only for those of us that watched it when it first aired, but for any fan of westerns or just good TV entertainment.

This price is outstanding and you can choose free shipping. I don't think you will find a better price. I pre-ordered mine here. I hope this set includes interviews. No matter I am sure it will be much better picture and sound quality than the VHS set I currently have. I got my TWWW set and it is great. The picture and sound quality are excellent. To top it off Robert Conrad gives an audio intro before each episode and there are a couple interviews with the production staff. They aren't very good as far as audio-visual since when the series was made they did not think about this sort of thing, but they are at least understandable and give some insight into the making of the series. The reason the interview sound isn't very good is they are from old reel-to-reel tapes, but they are still interesting to listen to for background on the series. I highly recommend this, especially to fans of the series.",1142899200,120,2938,4.628352490421456
2530849,5,B000ERVJKO,"Move over J.B.  Agent James T. West and his partner, Agent Artemis Gordon, master of disguise are on the job.  These 19th century Secret Service Agents provide some most enjoyable adventure battling bandits, tyrants, and a varity of the unique elements of criminal society, all the while providing protection for President U.S. Grant.  A brilliant mix of adventure, science fiction and fantasy during the post Civil War era.

As Paramount Home Video has had an excellent track record producing TV series season sets (sans T.A.G.S. #4), we hopefully will see clean audio/video digital transfers, single sided picture discs and hopefully bonus commentary from Mr. Conrad and perhaps from the galaxy of guest stars still with us.  We might even be graced with some archival commmentary from the amiable Ross Martin, a brilliant actor lost in his prime.",1142294400,6,849,5.1678832116788325
2530850,5,B000ERVJKO,"I agree that with the previous reviewer that the release of the original ""Wild Wild West"" series is a landmark event. By the way, this series should not be confused with the useless Smith/Kline movie released a few years ago.

Wild Wild West was a unique blend of western, spy, and science fiction genres.

If you are too young to have fond memories of seeing this series on TV, then you will not be disappointed by the DVD.",1141689600,8,424,4.423076923076923
2530851,5,B000ERVJKO,"There are no words to adequately express the excitement created by this DVD boxed set release of the complete first season of The Wild, Wild West. While several episodes were only available on DVD in recent years through a pricey enrollment club, this represents the first time the ENTIRE first season of this landmark TV Western icon has been available in ANY format!

Starring Robert Conrad as Agent James T. West, along with the late and deeply lamented, Ross Martin, who portrayed his partner, Artemis Gordon, master of disguise and invention, the series ran on CBS from 1965-1969.

The series focused on their adventures as the country's first secret service agents, working for President Ulysses S. Grant, to thwart all manner of evil doers who directed their villainy at individuals and/or the nation. Mixing espionage, thrilling adventure, western cliff-hanger suspense and high-tech, sci-fi gadgetry the likes of which had never been seen on network TV, the series propelled the actors into international stardom. On the series, West and Gordon traveled in style on a personal train equipped with the amazing gear they used each week to save the day and/or world (the interior of which was used in the epic Gunsmoke episode, ""Death Train."")

(Note: Martin, who suffered a heart attack during the first season, was replaced during the last season by the network because they were concerned about his health, which probably resulted in the series' demise. Actor Charles Aidman joined the cast, portraying Jeremy Pike, also a master of disguise, who was supposedly West's former partner. Two later made-for-TV movies, The Wild, Wild West Revisited in 1979, and More Wild, Wild West in 1980, reunited Conrad and Martin.)

The series (set in 1868 primarily in or around San Francisco) continues to be a source of fevered worldwide fan devotion. Like The Avengers, which also aired in the 1960s, The Wild, Wild West was made into a simply awful ""blockbuster"" big-screen feature film in the 1990s, which failed in every way to capture the quality, fun, adventure, action and entertainment of the original, beloved series.

The brilliant actor, the late Michael Dunn, guest starred in 10 episodes during the show's run (several considered the best in the series) as the diabolical nemesis of West and Gordon, Dr. Miguelito Loveless, who suffered from delusions of grandeur. (At 3 feet-10-inches tall, Dunn suffered from chondrodystroyphy, which eventually took his life. He was also a child prodigy with an IQ of 178 and became a concert pianist at age 15, and was a remarkable singer.)

Dr. Loveless was ably assisted by the devoted Voltaire, portrayed by Richard Kiel (best known for his portrayal of the evil ""Jaws"" in the James Bond films, ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Moonraker""), who is a towering 7-feet-two-inches tall! The juxtaposition of the two actors increased the pathos that Dunn used in his unforgettable performances expressing the doctor's jealousy and hatred of West for his ""perfect body"" and society in general for its embrace of physical beauty and harsh rejection of those who do not meet that superficial, rigid criteria.

Throughout the series, Conrad insisted on performing all of his own stunts (which were minion) and viewed himself as a tough-guy, developing a devoted stunt crew ""family."" Dunn, who was no slouch himself, also performed his stunts at the urging of Conrad, despite network fears that both actors would be seriously injured (Conrad did suffer numerous injuries and Dunn injured an ankle.)

As of this writing, the studio had not announced what, if any, special features would be included in the boxed set. The first season (the only one in black and white) had 28 episodes: The Night of the Inferno; The Night of the Deadly Bed; The Night the Wizard Shook the Earth (introducing Dr. Loveless); The Night of Sudden Death; Night of the Casual Killer (the only episode in the entire series to omit ""The"" before ""Night of"" in a title); The Night of a Thousand Eyes; The Night of the Glowing Corpse; The Night of the Dancing Death; The Night of the Double-Edged Knife; The Night that Terror Stalked the Town (also featuring Dr. Loveless); The Night of the Red-Eyed Madmen; The Night of the Human Trigger; The Night of the Torture Chamber; The Night of the Howling Light; The Night of the Fatal Trap; The Night of the Steel Assassin; The Night the Dragon Screamed; The Night of the Grand Emir; The Night of the Flaming Ghost; The Night of the Whirring Death (third Dr. Loveless episode); The Night of the Puppeteer; The Night of the Bars of Hell; The Night of the Two-Legged Buffalo; The Night of the Druid's Blood; The Night of the Freebooters; The Night of the Burning Diamond; The Night of the Murderous Spring (Dr. Loveless' final appearance in Season 1); and The Night of the Sudden Plague.",1141344000,431,4834,4.95925925925926

2530944,5,B000ERVJKO,"I love this show . I first remember watching this 1st episode Pilot where West is recruited for a special mission where We first see Him load up on His gadgets on a secret panel , I knew this was going to be good since I just seen around that time ThunderBall . Also in that episode that He wore a different outfit instead of the ""monkey suit "" that He ended up wearing . We had a B+W TV so I never noticed but knew after this year every show on TV went color .LOL  This show had each week a beautiful Girl that needed to be saved or turned by James West  and a nutty Bad Guy to destroy the world . I loved those gadget the slide out derringer was one my favorite an the shoe heal explosives , the grappling arrow He stuck in his gun with a wire , this guy was James Bond with tongue -in your -cheek humor really made this show work also with chemistry of Robert Conrad and Ross Martin who play the two Secret Service Men chosen to save the world each week . Along with Dr. Loveless popping up from time to time to only have West +Gordon foil His plans became a popular Villain on the show for years on the shows run . This First Season is very good , and since it was a new show it a bit more serious  than the other seasons . We get to see Ross Martin and look forward to who He would change His looks each week . I own the 3rd season too , but this season is better than that one. The price of this season is only $10 and for e price of lunch ist a  bad price .",1443916800,,1464,3.8217821782178216
2530945,4,B000ERVJKO,"Not all of the shows we watched when we were kids translate well to current day. But The Wild Wild West does pretty well.  It doesnt take itself too seriously and Im a sucker for plots with super-villains. This has plenty of villains. The verbal bandiage is a hoot. Lots of damsels to throw themselves at the athletic James West (played by Robert Conrad), lots of spy gadgets and many nefarious methods of execution  even if all of the latter fail. And how could I resist a show with episode titles like The Night of the Deadly Bed, The Night of the Two-Legged Buffalo and The Night of the Burning Diamond.

Last, but definitely not least, I get a kick out of Martin Ross acting. His Artemus Gordon, side-kick extraordinaire, is a treat, no matter what accent or costume he dons.

The Wild Wild West premiered in September, 1965, along with I Spy, Green Acres, Hogans Heroes, Petticoat Junction and Lost in Space. It lasted 4 seasons, and only the 1st is in B&W. The adventures of James West were an immediate hit, but like many different shows, it almost didn't get made.

One of the joys of this 40th Anniversary Edition is its Bonus Extras, including a great 13-minute audio interview with Ethel Winant, CBS executive. Ethel was in program development, and was asked to put together a proposal for a James Bond of the West. She tells how she started out with a set of Secret Service agents named Jim West, Tom East, Sam South and Hal North.

Robert Conrad gives a little introduction to each episode. My favorite was this one:
This is definitely one of the more bizarre episodes of The Wild Wild West. Guest star Don Rickles plays a sinister magician, and I end up convincing a group of disembodied brains to rise up and destroy the evil doctor who murdered them. [He chuckles.] Get ready for The Night of the Druids Blood.

In addition to the introductions, you can listen to the pilot episode with Robert Conrads enjoyable commentary track.  Ethel, in her interview, talks about how they had to cast around the very short Robert Conrad. In his commentary track, though, Conrad says that he is 5 8  and proud of it.

Unfortunately, no subtitles are available on this single-season DVD issue. Otherwise, this is a good-looking nice-watching set, fully remastered. The twenty-eight episodes total over 22 hours of viewing.

Happy Reader",1443657600,5,2338,4.691931540342298
2530946,5,B000ERVJKO,"I loved watching ""The Wild Wild West"" as a kid, and looked forward to watching the complete first season more than 40 years later.  I was astonished at how BAD it was...LAUGHABLY bad!  The acting is hokey, the special effects are hokey, the fight scenes are hokey.  I cringed and thought ""I actually liked this?!""
So why the five-star rating?  As a time capsule of 1960s television, it's a gem.  That's how ALL prime-time action shows were back then.  The mash-up of Western/spy/science fiction genres was inspired.  That was the final era of black-and-white TV, and it had a look & feel that today's hard-edged color can't match.  It was a tightly-written show, fast-paced and exciting.  The special features of this edition alone are worth the price.  Robert Conrad's intros to each episode are excellent, and the in-depth interviews about the creation and operation of the show are fascinating.
""The Wild Wild West"" is an artifact of TV's first era.  It's not fair to say that television was better back then because it wasn't.  But it was still innocent, still fun, still just entertainment.  You could plunk your kid down in front of the set and not worry about what he was watching.",1443484800,2,1188,4.793103448275862

From the first moment I stumbled across the show on TV I loved it and now cant get enough. I don't normally watch westerns and was surprised that I like this one--well its not a typical western. I am glad they did not ruin the first season by colorizing it. My favorite character is Artemus Gordon, played by  Ross Martin.

2531017,5,B000ERVJKO,"I am in a slow process of reviewing all of these shows. The set is very nice, with special features for each hour program.
However, the man himself, James West(Robert Conrad)gives a little preview at the beginning of each show. There is
a vintage-looking ""PLAY"" button you can push that makes the episode itself begin. If you listen to the audio preview,
you find a lot about what is going to happen. There is a bad side and a good side to this preview. If you are searching
for a particular show and don't know the show by title, you can play that preview, or as much of it as you like, to find out
what the episode is about. Four episodes concern the dwarf scientist(he is evil)Dr. Miguelito Loveless. That's a cue.
On the other hand, if you never saw any shows, or not since the 60's, I mean a long time ago, then the spoken
preview will ""spoil"" the show. That's my feeling.

I am not a professional reviewer or journalist, but I believe that the first season in the series is the best, artistically
and as television media, of all the seasons, and I have seen them all in the last ten years. Not that the later color
shows are inferior material. If I were to find critiques of Batman I could probably find a lot of Batman fans who feel
the same about that show.  That the first shows were the best, because the show is new and original.

I don't mean to relegate the later writers, and people who worked on the Wild Wild West, but there is a general
attitude that the first Wild Wild West season is top-shelf. The producer wanted to make the best impression on
an audience who was interested in 1800's stories about agents or crime fighters who wanted to bring super-criminals
to justice. There is a smattering of science-fiction through all the episodes, much Dr. Loveless must account for.
Michael Dunn's character makes it to later episodes.  In Michael Garrison's series, the creator of Wild Wild
West, there is a lot of subterfuge, trickery, Gordon's disguises(West gets the girl a lot, and Gordon does NOT
disguise his contempt. But he tries.) A good of incendiary action, in the form of explosions, smoke bombs, some
of those are noxious. These are also part of later seasons. But the palate of viewers who enjoy great dialogue is best
satisfied by the screenplay of the first season, which is ""in glorious black and white"" as they say.  Which goes back
to my personal opinion of myself, that I am or must be a snob.  The lines, the stories themselves, in this first
season are very satisfying. It could be that the material of all those old shows is General Audience. So that if
you were a teen-ager you could watch any of the Wild Wild West programs and no one would mind. The later
programs were more fun, I guess you could say. Maybe more trivial, not as tiring if you or I were in school and
doing homework. These programs were all on in reruns for a long time, which is a credit to their value as good
and entertaining shows. The 1965 show where the Indian squaw kisses west is a treasure. It's part of the agent's
torture, which he likes, I think.

2531072,4,B000ERVJKO,"If you are the newly elected President Grant, you quickly discover your experience as a Civil War General did not prepare you for the chaotic political mess and corruption in Washington.  To make matters worse, the tenuous hold on the western territories is in danger from a spate of post-war egomaniacs bent on grand schemes of murder, mayhem, thievery, and tyranny.  You need help!  You can't send in the army; perhaps you could deploy a couple of secret agents.  A name comes to mind of an agent who never gives up a fight - a quality you greatly admire.  His name: James West.

If you are a genius at the bizarre; a madman who has an insatiable urge to control and manipulate others like puppets on your mental strings; an egomaniac with a grandiose vision of a world under your masterful stroke, then there is something you should know: don't operate near a rail line; if you do, two agents are going to knock over your monumental ego.

If you are one of the many beautiful women entangled in the vines of an evil genius, don't think you are immune to the charms of the dapper - and sometimes shirtless - James West, even if he is securely tied up and about to be eliminated.  And, what ever you do, don't kiss him; you might find yourself turning to the light side.

If you are Artemus Gordon, you have a blast creating many of Jim's lethal secret gadgets and a rollickingly good time playing an assortment of characters to trip up the bad guys.  Best of all, you get to ride in the greatest bachelor pad ever made - a government-provided railcar; now, if you could get the ladies to take their eyes off of Mr. West ...

The scene in question is Dr. Loveless's speech at the end of ""The Night of the Murderous Spring"" where he explains to Jim in detail why he despises him.

The crazy perversity of this show is the main reason I still find it watchable. I am totally willing to hand wave away any race or feminist sensibilities I  may have if you give me my Loveless/West love/hate obsessive dynamic. I love them.

I have listen to the episodes and also listened to the full explanation and they even include a Music Rehearsal in which you hear the musicians and Markowitz talking.

The whole series is wonderful.  I remember some episodes and even had a single DVD with 3 episodes (Grand Emir,Whirling Death and the Puppeteer) from a earlier version that got damaged over the years.  But for pure fun and entertainment, it is a real mccoy,",1249344000,,706,4.645161290322581
2531079,5,B000ERVJKO,"Wild Wild West is one of my three favorite shows (along with Man from UNCLE and Hawaii 5-0.)  This show basically started as James Bond out west.  The early episodes are fairly down to earth as rather far-out western adventures.  However as the season progressed and subsequent seasons, WWW moved into the realm of western fantasy.  The highlight of this season is ""The Night of the Puppeteer"" guest-starring Lloyd Bochner as a villainous madman named Zacariah Skull (one of my favorite all-time TV names.)  There are several appearances by the dwarf genius Dr Loveless as well.
No matter how far out WWW got, it was always played totally serious.  It never veered into the realm of silliness that Man from UNCLE and several of the Irwin Allen series devolved into.  (Interestingly enough, 2 WWW made-for-tv movies done after the show was cancelled were done in a silly manner and as a result are terrible.) The stars of the series, Robert Conrad and the late, great Ross Martin seemed to really like each other and it shows up there on the screen.
The first season was the only season in black and white and like so many series that moved into color their second seasons, (Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Lost in Space, etc,) the color in those second seasons and beyond was beautiful.  It is probably sacreligious to say this but I wouldn't mind a good job of colorizing this first season.  Several years ago they did an excellent job of colorizing the first year of McHales Navy, a series that was never broadcast in color.)
CBS/Paramount actually did an excellent job with this set.  Robert Conrad intros to each episode, an audio commentary, audio interviews with others who worked on the series, etc.  (I love Conrad.  He is still hard-as-nails tough and pulls no punches.  I especially enjoyed him talking about meeting Will Smith and his wife on the street and giving Smith a piece of his mind about what he thought about Smith's Wild Wild West abomination of a film.  Smith got away from him fast.  If there is one thing that Conrad is not, it is politically correct, bravo.)
Despite the ton of extra material on set one, seasons 2-4 have zero extras.  I cannot understand why they couldn't have had Conrad do the episode intros on the next three years, how long could it have taken?  CBS/Paramount did the same thing with season 1 of Mannix: Mike Connors' intros, interviews with Connors and Joe Campanella, audio commentaries.  Season 2 of Mannix: zilch.
Wild Wild West was a big hit and I believe it could've run a decade.  However Congress started holding self-serving hearing on violence on tv.  The only thing to come out of those hearings was the premature cancellation of WWW and the removal of the shoot-out at the beginning of Gunsmoke.
This is another of the many series of the 1960s that so many of us loved and remembered.  If you have never seen it, you will enjoy it greatly.  If you really want to get into the more fantasy-oriented and gothic horror episodes, I might begin with season 2.  (No show did gothic horror better than WWW, it was amazing what they could do with a limited budget in those days.) Whichever season you get, you will be satisfied.  This show was so prematurely and stupidly cancelled afer only 4 seasons that it never had time to get played-out. Check it out.",1248220800,3,3310,4.657487091222031

2531113,5,B000ERVJKO,"Its not surprising to see all this fan mail on the first season of TWWW. Many of the reviewers hit the nail on the head as to why it worked so well.
1) The chemistry between Conrad and Martin. I met Martin in the mid-60's when I was a teenager and he confirmed for me that Conrad and he were close personal friends on and off the set. When appearing as guests on variety shows (such as Joey Bishop's show) you could see the comradree between them. It was Conrad who gave the eulogy at Ross Martin's funeral.
2) The juxtaposition of good and evil. The criminal genius has been a staple throughout literature. Think of Sherlock Holmes's nemesis Dr. Moriarty. TWWW had them in spades. Standouts include Lloyd Bochner, Keenan Wynn, Victor Buono, and in a stroke of casting genius, dwarf actor Michael Dunn as the brilliant but twisted Dr. Loveless along with the seven foot tall actor Richard Kyle as Voltaire his mute assistant. So popular was Dunn's character that he appeared in 10 episodes each with an even more incredible plan to control the world.
3) Plausability: Written into the plots were fantastic machines of what Gilded Age technology and ultimate weapons would have looked like to mid 19th century man. Hulking, clanking, steam belching contraptions with lots of exposed iron rivets. All real Jules Verne, who of course was writing his famous stories at the time TWWW was set.
3) Accuracy of time and place: The sets, costumes ( except for Conrad's tight pants), historical references to people, places and events lent verisimilitude to the plots.
4) Acting: To make all the above come together and work everyone has to react as if its real. As if these villans and their mad schemes are an actual threat. West, Gordon, President Grant all play it straight and serious.  So when West and Gordon come face to face with one of these Victorian era metal monsters and its creator you can see the fear in their faces, the threat it poses and sense the uncertainty of how to defeat it.

Quite simply, it all works wonderfully. Too bad they don't make televsion like this anymore.",1230163200,2,2084,4.67574931880109

2531118,4,B000ERVJKO,"I started watching this show when it first came on television.  I was 12 at the time, probably a perfect age to enjoy it most.  I watched it through the entire four year run and it was a great show to look forward to on Friday nights after a week of school.  The plots were simplistic and the acting was a bit stilted but it was simply a fun show to watch.  Throwing James Bond, which I was into as well, into the old west with the suave, debonair personae of Robert Conrad along with Ross Martin playing the intellectual sidekick was great fun.  And for a 12 year old male the attractive women were enjoyable as well.  I've picked up the first season so far and fondly am repeating those long gone years.  It was great seeing Suzanne Pleshette in the first episode, she was always gorgeous, and then seeing other actors and actresses that are much older or passed away in other episodes.  Of course watching the fight scenes, the passe secret weapons of the era, and the obligatory death traps that West always escapes is simply good fun.  I plan on picking up the remaining season sets as I finish each one.  I think they would be fun for someone new to the series as well.",1209254400,,1175,4.324200913242009
2531156,5,B000ERVJKO,Glad to see this on DVD.  The intro's by Robert Conrad are a good background to each episode.  Was one of my favorite series and never understood why it was not in the rerun lineup.  Looking forward to getting the remaining seasons.,1208649600,,232,4.476190476190476

I waited a long time for the original ""Wild Wild West"" TV series to come to DVD. The Editorial review pretty much covers what the DVD set is about but let me add that I think this was one of the very best TV shows to come out in the 60's. I think it holds its own today though the sets and special effects seem rather primitive with today's 21st Century technology. What makes this show great though was the imaginative story lines and the performances of its main characters: Robert Conrad as James West, Ross Martin as Artemis Gordon, and especially Michael Dunn in his recurring role of the evil genius, Dr. Miguelito Loveless. Anyone who knows of the Wild Wild West only from that disastrous movie really needs to see the original TV series to understand why this became a TV cult classic. My only criticism is that some of the included commentaries were rather boring.  Still, this is pure action-adventure accented with some great fight scenes (a tip of the hat to the stunt crew). This was TV at its best. PS Wait until you see the following seasons in color!",1204243200,,1274,5.179611650485437
2531158,5,B000ERVJKO,"I'd always assumed that this show was a Western.  How wrong I was!  It's a great adventure, with two best friends/agents partying on a train in between gigs, battling dastardly villains, dealing with gorgeous and sometimes dangerous ladies, pulling gizmos, gadgets and tricks out of their shoes, and more.
Robert Conrad is the handsome leading man, with lovely clothing and quick reflexes--but he still often needs help from friend and associate Ross Martin, who can do accents, voices, makeup, and become a chameleon at a moment's notice in order to extract his pal from whatever pickle he's gotten himself into.
A lot of fun.  Don't miss out!",1200787200,,644,5.0
2531159,4,B000ERVJKO,"I was twelve in 1965 when the first season aired, and I had/have fond memories of the show, having not seen any re-runs since its initial broadcast.  As I started to watch the DVDs I had a very mixed reaction.  The episodes are very inconsistent, and the show had a lot of producers that first season and went off in a lot of different directions.  Was it a Western?  A spy show?  A science fiction show?  It seems to take a long time finding its legs, and as it did so, many of the early episodes were horribly written and shot.
And yet, by the time I was done with the first season, I had a good taste in my mouth and I just now ordered the second season.  Why?
You have to give Robert Conrad a lot of credit, he may not have been the greatest actor at that time, but he certainly put a lot of energy into the roll.  He does most of his own stunts and you very much see it on the screen.  Lots of contrived excuses to have all those fights, but what the heck, it is enjoyable.  Ross Martin was a great character actor too, and it was fun to watch him both graciously play second fiddle to Conrad and get into the wide variety of charcters that he played, he seemed to have a great time going over the top once or twice every episode.  There were a lot of fun character actors doing guest shots on the show too, if you are a fan of the period or character actors in general, it is fun to watch just for that, as is much of 60's television.  The first season also has four episodes with Michael Dunn as Dr. Miguelito Loveless.  Those episodes really stand out, not because they were particularly well written, but because Dunn gave very over the top performances that were very fun to watch.  And once the formula for having at least one incredibly attractive woman in each episode fell into place, that was an added draw as well.
So overall, I got a great deal of pleasure re-watching something that I had enjoyed from my childhood.  The show does not have the foundation that Star Trek had, and in turn watching The Wild Wild West made me appreciate what I have always loved about the original Star Trek series.  Make no mistake there, watching other series from the same period you do come to realize why Star Trek is a stand out show and gained the longevity that it has.  But at the same time the Wild Wild West, for all of its flaws, once I came to accept the limitations of the period, was fun and easy to watch once again.  Shows like Mission: Impossible and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea from the same period did not to me hold up anywhere near as well.",1194220800,3,2564,4.187372708757637
2531160,5,B000ERVJKO,"I loved watching Wild Wild West in syndication as a kid and here I am an adult, loving it on dvd!!  The first season of this sci-fi western runs more like a western than the following seasons.  While it's rough around the edges, it definitely shows the promised potential of it's creativity and the writers' ingenuity.  Since this was made back in the 60s, any innuedos, especially sexual, were very subtle and symbolic.  And this definitely adds to its charm and humor!  In one scene of an episode, at a lavish and private dinner for two, the femme fatale discusses the murder of male family members to James West as she loudly cracks nuts.  I really laughed.  The dialogue is also subtle and clever.  What a riot. Robert Conrad also does vocal intros to each episode in the first season.  There is also a wonderful interview with Robert Conrad and Ross Martin from 1979.  Red West also joins in and it's hilarious!!  This was when they were making a Wild West movie for TV.  If you look close, you can tell Ross Martin's health is declining as he had heart issues from what I've read and I believe he passed on in 1983.  Anyway, the first season is in black and white, wonderful to watch, and has a charm in it's own right. And goodness....Robert Conrad sure was hot in his day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1190937600,2,1296,4.5344827586206895

I have both seasons 1 and 2; both are excellently restored.  For both, video and audio quality is excellent. I had forgotten what a great job the 60s tv shows did with music, which really adds to the atmosphere of the show.  I prefer Season One.  To me, the black and white presentation has a classic look that holds up much better than the coloredition . It seems that a lot of the early color tv shows overdid the color in costumes and set designs.  Some of the color episodes have a Batman and Robin look to them.  Season one also has some of the best story lines.  The stories that I remembered when I first saw the show as kid seemed to come from Season One.",1185494400,,786,4.2

Considering that this was digitalized from 40 year old film I was amazed. I grew up watching The Wild Wild West in the 1960's and love Ross Martin's portrayal of Artemus Gordon. The world lost a great actor when he passed away but if he could see these DVD's I think he would say with a big smile ""James by boy, this is a great DVD."" And of course who could forget

Robert Conrad's Jim West.  Now you can see all of those fight scenes in greater detail. I also have season two. The B&W is great but the color episodes are fantastic. I can't wait for season 3 & 4.  Katheryn, Ohio",1179360000,9,713,4.064285714285714

2531211,5,B000ERVJKO,"This series is great for family night. I watched 28 episodes on 7 discs and not one, four letter word in any of them. And no sex!  WOW! Each episode is full of action and drama. The episodes are well written with top acting.

The story is about two Secret Services agents (Artemus and James) that travel by private train through the old west fighting genius mad scientists who either want to dominate or destroy the world. Artemus, a brilliant scientist himself, is always coming up with some new invention that keeps our two heroes just one step ahead of the bad guys.

This series has something for the whole family. The kids will love it and the price is a steal. Try taking the family to the cinema for under $2.00 a movie. It is not going to happen.

Paramount Pictures did a great job of digitally remastering each episode. Every DVD has excellent picture and outstanding sound. If you like the Wild West and you like science fiction you will be happy you bought this series. BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT!",1174003200,5,1005,4.445652173913044
2531212,5,B000ERVJKO,"Spy movies with gadgets were very popular in the 1960's.  Westerns were popular, though that popularity was waning by 1965.  Michael Garrison combined the still popular western with the newly popular James Bond and created the ""Wild Wild West.""  Robert Conrad was James T. West, the star of the show who did his own stunts and had an array of gadgets at his disposal, many of them courtesy of Artemus Gordon (the late Ross Martin), Jim West's equivalent of James Bond's Q.  The show was occasionally campy, but it was fun and imaginative.

I had forgotten about many of the stars who appeared in the first season of this series.  Though modern audiences may have forgotten many of these stars, they were very well known in the 1960's.  Don Rickles played a criminal in one episode.  Mild mannered Arthur O'Connell played a very different character in yet another episode.  Even Burgess Meredith appeared in an episode.  I could spend a page detailing the list of actors who guest starred in the first season of this show; Richard Kiel, Michael Dunn (who appeared in eleven episodes as Dr. Loveless), Nick Adams, Dana Wynter, Yvonne Craig, Richard Jaekel, Philip Ahn, Martin Landau, Leslie Nielson, Katherine Ross, John Barrymore (Drew Barrymore's father), Ruta Lee, Robert Loggia, Suzanne Pleshette, and Victor Buono are just a few of the dozens of guest stars.

The 28 stories are extremely varied.  There are episodes that are nearly classic westerns.  There are other stories that are highly imaginative spy stories.  Yet others have a science fiction flavor to them.  A few are also surreal in places.

Though many of the devices in this first season would eventually become real devices, in many cases the devices would not be invented for many years yet.  The best example I can think of is the electric chair, which was not used until at least a decade after the era in which the series is set.  Another example is a mobile tank, which did not appear until World War I.

Some of the devices used in the series were certainly possible, and appear as though they may have been ""borrowed"" from James Bond.  James West's boots had compartments in the heels that could hide a derringer or other helpful equipment.  James West also sometimes had a gun up his sleeve.  There were smoke bombs and other high explosives.  Perhaps the best device of all was the train on which Artemus and Jim traveled.  The train had a small arsenal, a lovely room with a pool table and wet bar, and sundry devices helpful in repelling intrusions.  Every western James Bond equivalent should have a train like the one in this series.

I was surprised and pleased at the quality of the DVD transfer and the sound.  Both were excellent.  I am glad the studio decided to release the first season in its original black & white rather than doing an artificial colorizing.  There are also numerous extras, several of which I find very fascinating.  There is a television interview with Robert Conrad and Ross Martin.  There is also an old commercial with Robert Conrad asking you to knock a battery off his shoulder.  One of the best features is an introduction to each episode by Robert Conrad.

I was a big fan of the television series when it came out.  The series has aged.  I find it much easier to pick out when sets are used.  The special effects in many cases are no longer quite as special.  Yet, the series remains charming and frequently very clever.  I found myself intrigued by the method that Jim and Artemus used to get themselves out of each, almost impossible predicament.

""Wild Wild West"" has joined the array of television shows that have become classic television.  The show was inspired and creative.  The show used its unique premise to come up with plots that few other shows could encompass.  I enjoyed every moment of these DVD's and I look forward to watching them again.

2531215,5,B000ERVJKO,"As a teenager, I first became interested in the martial arts by watching James West ply his trade in this series.  Although his defensive and offensive moves now look phony and ineffective, 42 years ago they completely captured my attention and imagination.  Initially, I tried my hands and feet at a number of martial arts styles before settling on John McSweeney's version of Kenpo Karate.  (John was one of Ed Parker's first black belts.)  I was the head instructor at his school, Self-Defense Unlimited, in Elmhurst, Illinois, for over 20 years, eventually earning a 7th degree black belt.

As editor of the American Kenpo Karate Association newsletter, I wrote many articles on the martial arts, as well as two books that are sold on Amazon.  And, of course, I learned the value of working out every day and pushing my body to its limits--and beyond.  The bottom line is that Wild Wild West truly had a profound influence on my life.

I loved the introductions that Robert Conrad did for every episode that gave some information about the actor in that particular episode and/or personal insight to the episode that we didn't know about.  It was very nice of him to share his personal feelings about this series and how it meant to the people who watched it.  As Robert Conrad said, it's just too bad that the powers-that-be wanted to save some money by shooting this first season in black and white when all the other shows in 1965 were being shot in color.  How even more spectacular this first season would have looked if it had been shot in color!  Robert Conrad and Ross Martin were one of the best TV duos of all time and will never been duplicated.  Even if you were too young to remember that series or weren't born yet, I highly recommend that you purchase this series and see how TV is supposed to be like.  There will never be another The Wild Wild West.",1168819200,4,1010,4.421621621621622
2531269,5,B000ERVJKO,"I used to love watching this show!  It first aired when I was just getting into my formative years as a young lady.  I remember my mother came in the room one day when I was watching it -- she said ""I don't know if I like you watching that show, he's always taking his shirt off.""  ""Oh, really, Mom?  I hadn't noticed...""  Hehe.  I would venture to say that Robert Conrad is responsible for my taste in men!  (Thanks, Bob!)

Being a Bond fan as well, I loved the concept of marrying Bond and the Old West.  What genius that was!  There were too many standard Westerns around, and then here came a show that was DIFFERENT.  It had all the elements of Bond but with a Western twist -- the hero, the sidekick with the gadgets, the villains (my favorite, of course, was Dr. Loveless), the girls, the gorgeous train... even a beautiful black horse with a silver studded saddle, in my book right up there with an Aston Martin... what's not to like??

The DVD set is amazing.  I have only just now gotten through the entire first disk and into the second, but the special features are great.  I love the intros by Conrad for the episodes.  All I can say is, forget the horrible 90's movie, go back to the original and best, and BUY THIS!!

The video transfer is truly remarkable and the sound is clean and crisp and fans definitely will be pleased with the quality of both.

Paramount Studios have proven that they can release a complete season set at an affordable price for the legions of ""The Wild Wild West"" fans. This outstanding 7 single sided disc set contains all 28 season one episodes in the order of their original airdates and it's filled with special features sure to please fans of the show. The discs come in slim cases and the packaging and artwork is fantastic. I am really amazed that Paramount Studios put such an effort into this DVD release and hope that the same detail will be given to the remaining season sets. I give season one five stars for its great characters, neat gadgets and scores of beautiful women. Any ""Wild Wild West"" fan new or old would be happy to own this set. Bring on season two!

James West (Robert Conrad) and his sidekick Artemus Gordon (Ross Martin) join forces as an unlikely pair of Secret Service Agents mainly working to protect President Ulysses S. Grant while investigating federal crimes in the old west. The ""Wild Wild West"" fan appeal became almost apparent from the very beginning with its cleverly written and sometimes outlandish and frequently bizarre plots. Each weekly episode title began with a variation of ""The Night of the"" theme in it. In ""The Night the Wizard Shook the Earth"" (original airdate 10/01/65) James and Artemus first encounter the nefarious Miguelito Loveless, played to absolute perfection by dwarf actor Michael Dunn.

The character of Miguelito Loveless was such a huge hit with fans that Michael Dunn starred in four of the first season's 28 episodes and he made six more appearances in subsequent seasons. Miguelito Loveless was also accompanied by his mute henchman Voltaire, played by giant actor Richard Kiel. Each week the duo of James West & Artemus Gordon would be given their assignment and would arrive in deluxe fashion via their tricked-out custom railroad car complete with all the gadgets. It's sad that this wonderful show only ran for four seasons. They don't make great shows like this anymore and probably never will again!

2531274,5,B000ERVJKO,"I had these shows memorized as a kid and a few years ago I laboriously taped every episode off of TNT.  The DVD's are a godsend.  I bought this set the week it came out and have worked through the set a few times since.  I was not a huge fan of the B&W episodes as a kid, so watching these a few times gave me the chance to fully appreciate the first season anew.  It is interesting to observe some dynamics in this season that didn't migrate into subsequent years.  Most notably, Jim is pretty clearly the boss, and Artie his assistant--Jim gives Artie orders, keeps him in the dark about elements of their plans, gets rather irritated when Artie fails to keep President Grant from a danger zone, and so on.  He even calls Artie ""Artemis"" until the last few episodes.  You also get a good sense for how many actor-villains played recurring roles on the series.  Richard Kiel, Bob Phillips, Nick Adams, Kathie Browne, Ruta Lee, Victor Buono, Richard Jaeckel, Alfred Ryder, and Theo Marcuse all play baddies this season, and all pop up again in later years as different characters.  One of the show's two all-purpose henchmen, Whitey Hughes, makes his first appearance, though Red West (one of Elvis's buddies) doesn't seem to be in any of these episodes.  The show had lots of now-familiar faces in guest roles, and it's fun to see some of these in Season 1: Don Rickles, Leslie Nielsen, Martin Landau, Suzanne Pleshette.

2531321,3,B000ERVJKO,"The intervening years from when this was on television seem to have added an aspect of appreciation to my memory that has now been dispelled by seeing it on DVD.  Certainly worthwhile as a western series, just not the equal to ""Rawhide"", as I falsely remembered it was!  Quality is as we accepted in those days, but it has not been remastered as ""Rawhide"" or ""Hogan's Heroes"" which now look better than they did when broadcast originally.  Not so bad as to be painful to watch, and worth 'buying a memory' at such a relatively cheap price, so long as you're not expecting too much: apparently I was!",1163203200,4,599,4.527777777777778

The ""additional"" features on the discs are OK, but basically filler stuff to give the hard-core fan as much as they could provide. It was nice to hear Robert Conrad recalling some memories from each episode. I am really hoping they release the secons season since the first was in B&W. The color episodes are what I remember when I used to watch this show as a kid. They were also more evolved than the first season and upped it a notch.

2531325,4,B000ERVJKO,"President Grant enlists the aid of James West and Artemus Gordon to help battle increasingly nefarious criminals throughout the fairly new Western Territories. West and Gordon are equipped with a special train car and ride to various destinations throughout, battling wits with some crazed people along the way. During their adventures, West uses his wits and physical prowess while Gordon uses his skills at disguise and invention to come up with some interesting ""James Bond""-like gadgets.

Basically, my one previous exposure to ""The Wild, Wild West"" came with the horrible 1999 movie adaptation of the popular 1960's television series. I couldn't believe Barry Sonnenfeld, Will Smith, Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh would perpetuate such a terrible film on the public, but there you have it. So, when I recently heard they were releasing the first season of the television series, starring Robert Conrad and Ross Martin, on DVD, I decided to give it a look.

From the first episode I was hooked. Combining elements of James Bond films, ""Mission: Impossible"" and the typical Western, series creator Michael Garrison came up with a fun, off-the-wall series which is surprisingly good.

The first thing that struck me was the show is played remarkably straight. Because Conrad and Martin, as Secret Service agents James West and Artemus Gordon, respectively, take everything fairly serious, it makes the threat of danger more palpable and all of the fantastical elements more believable. Yes, they are frequently dealing with mad scientists and crazy generals, but they simply believe these people are real and provide real threat. So, when Burgess Meredith pops up as a mad geologist who sets off devastating earthquakes in Montana using nitroglycerin in an effort to take over the state, we believe it can happen. When Robert Drivas appears as a handsome scientist who can melt diamonds and use their properties to make him move at a speed undetectable to the human eye, we see the recognition of fear in West and Gordon's eyes. Then, during their run-ins with the popular Dr. Miguelito Loveless (Michael Dunn), we understand why they believe he wants to reclaim California for himself and realize why they have to stop him. A friend told me the series got progressively wild, which may have led to it's downfall after only four seasons, but during this first year, there is a remarkable sense of believability, the various elements just skirt the point of no return.

The second thing that struck me was the production value. Using a special train car provided by President Grant, West and Gordon travel through the West, trying to prevent various plots from coming true. The train is outfitted with a special room providing the duo with an arsenal to choose from and Gordon, an inventor, frequently comes up with new inventions, some of which are introduced early in the story and prove helpful later, some of which conveniently appear when the timing is right, much like a new addition to Batman's utility belt.

As they travel from 1880s San Francisco, to Denver, to a fort in the Arizona desert, to Montana, to Mexico, every location appears to have been researched at least a little. Clearly, they were built on sets, but there is a lot of attention to detail. Often, they have scenes set in mansions, or consulates, and the interiors are as grand as you would expect. A story involving a mad, blind Sea Captain and his Chinese lover is set in a particularly gloomy and wet lighthouse. All of these details add to the look, feel and mood of the stories.

On the DVDs, Robert Conrad provides an audio introduction to each episode and talks briefly about the story, or the idea, or how historically accurate the story was. One interesting thing he talks about is how the first executive producer on the show made the episodes he worked on too much like a conventional western. He was replaced and the new executive producer embraced the more outlandish elements of the series, making it more like a spy story. These early, more traditional western episodes are interspersed throughout the season and they are the least satisfying because they seem the most artificial. We don't want to see West and Gordon involved in shootouts, we want to see the duo outwit their opponents with wits and clever inventions. Then a third executive producer was brought in later who began to take the show in an even more fantastical direction, such as when West and Gordon have to save a Supreme Court Justice from life-size killer marionettes.

As you watch Robert Conrad, you begin to realize that he is better than you might remember. Yes, it is funny to watch him in highly choreographed fight movements, swinging his arm and stopping at a precise moment when the henchman falls to the ground. Or when he uses a combination of karate and ballet to create some unusual and theatrical fight moves. It is also amusing to watch the producers come up with endless ways to get his shirt off to show off Conrad's buff body for the delight of many viewers. The producers clearly wanted to give the female portion of their audience something to watch and since they couldn't get him out of his pants, they did the next best thing and made sure his pants were always a couple of sizes too small. Also, almost every episode ends with Conrad in a lip lock with one of the female characters. Occasionally, he ends up kissing a female villain, who they have conveniently decided was forced to participate in the scheme against their will.

Ross Martin is also enjoyable as the right hand man Artemus Gordon. Providing a little comic relief throughout (he frequently dons the disguise of a woman, at one point, an elderly grandmother, at another, a Senorita) and coming up with crazy accents and inventions, he often lightens the mood. A remarkable number of the episodes provide for him to disappear for long stretches of time, giving Conrad the spotlight. These episodes are less successful because ""The Wild, Wild West"" is all about the teamwork of the duo, their friendship, their camaraderie, their skill at catching criminals.

Each of the episodes is titled ""The Night of..."", a not uncommon method of titling used in television. The popular show ""Friends"" named each of its episodes ""The One With..."" The standouts in season 1 are:

The Night The Wizard Shook The Earth - Marking the first appearance of Dr. Miguelito Loveless (Michael Dunn) and his henchman, Voltaire (Richard Kiel, who would later play `Jaws"" in the James Bond films), this episode has the element of surprise. It isn't often we see a diminutive villain like Dr. Loveless. And his plan to use a professor's new explosive to reclaim California as his birthright sets the tone for his future appearances.

The Night of the Sudden Death - West and Gordon investigate a theft at the U.S. Mint in Denver. The best part of this episode is the actual theft, watching a series of black clad henchmen scaling the wall, entering a high window and infiltrating the Mint.

The Night of a Thousand Eyes - An early example of the sort of outlandishness that would become a hallmark of the series; West and Gordon do battle with a blind sea captain who lives in a lighthouse on the Mississippi river. He wants to take revenge on the shipping companies so he and his crew go about sinking any ship that comes near. The blind sea captain's lover is a Chinese woman who speaks in a strange sort of tone.

The Night of the Whirring Death - West and Gordon help the Governor of California, a man they dislike, pick up bribes from shady types who are buying respectability. The Governor of California needs these bribes to prevent the state from going bankrupt. Naturally, Dr. Loveless learns of the plan and begins killing the people who are ""contributing"" to the fund.

The Night of the Puppeteer - West and Gordon are out to prevent the further assassinations of Supreme Court Justices. At the home of one of these jurists, West is invited to a puppet show for his granddaughter's birthday. Then he notices one of the marionettes pull out a gun. He stops the assassination attempt and soon realizes there are stranger forces at work.

The Night of the Burning Diamond - San Francisco is hosting an exhibit of rare gems from around the world. West makes a personal plea to the Minister of the Balkans to protect their famous diamond and asks them not to show it. Some recent high profile thefts have everyone concerned. Just as he visits, a strange force enters the room and steals the diamond, literally right before their eyes. Soon, West and Gordon meet Morgan Midas (Robert Drivas), a young scientist who melts down the diamonds and drinks the elixir, speeding his metabolism until he is moving so fast, he can't be seen by the naked eye.

The last thing that occurred to me as I watched the first season of ""The Wild, Wild West"" is that despite the fact it is shot in black and white, or maybe because of this, the show appears remarkably timeless. Thankfully, the producers refrained from trying to introduce the 60s style of music or dress to the series. They centered their creative efforts on creating early examples of inventions which would later become a reality. For instance, in one episode, a madman uses an early example of a tank, which would've been invented a couple of decades later. In early episodes, Gordon talks about tubes that can transmit pictures and the like, adding a fun, lighthearted air to the stories.

""The Wild, Wild West: Complete Season 1"" is a mix of wild west, spy, ""Mission Impossible"" and lighthearted elements which should appeal to a large number of people.",1159920000,18,9639,4.821536600120992
2531356,4,B000ERVJKO,"This is and will always be a great timeless series, mainly because of it's stars Robert Conrad (who will always be the best James West) and Ross Martin along with the most imaginative, witty, and action-packed scripts along with tremendous guest-stars. All true action scenes by Robert Conrad in the days where special effects & computer graphics had no play in this series. I really rate this set for myself as a number 5. The only reason I give it a 4 :  Many tv series that started out with first season Black and White episodes, and then went to color. This First season in my opinion should be colorized with the option of both being available-color and B&W. The colorizing process is much improved today, where most people can never tell the difference. Especially the First season of West is the best and my favorite. Many other shows that have come out on DVD had B&W 1st or more seasons and are doing this process-like Bewitched, and I Dream Of Jeannie- both series have colorized & B&W versions & both are available separately for customer preference. Other shows should do the same. When Man from U.N.C.L.E. comes out to DVD i hope the 1st season gets a colorized version with B&W because it arrived in the same year as Jim West-all other seasons were in color. Anyway, very high top marks for this WILD, WILD WEST set and I'am looking forward to seasons 2 through 4 in color, and if season 1 comes out with a colorized version: I would get that one as well.",1159315200,,1469,4.522556390977444
2531357,4,B000ERVJKO,"Enjoyed watching one of the first sci-fi shows on TV.  Love the gadgets and Artemus' disguises!  The ""Special Features"" are somewhat disappointing, though.",1157587200,,155,5.695652173913044
2531358,5,B000ERVJKO,"I remember watching ""Wild Wild West"" when it first came out and I became a fan immediately.  Watching the pilot was a treat because I missed it when the show first aired.  I am glad that CBS DVD released this in black and white because it adds to the intrigue and atmosphere of the show.

Robert Conrad as ""James West"" and Ross Martin as ""Artemus Gordon"" made their characters come to life.  I fell in love with James West as a kid and I still feel he is one of the best characters ever on TV.  Watching him again has been fun and entertaining.  He is a cross between James Bond and MacGyver yet set in the old west.  He is charming, handsome, always has what he needs to get out of a scrape, and great with the ladies.

I also looked forward to seeing what disguises Artemus would use to assist West.  Ross Martin, in truth, played many characters and he excelled as an actor in doing so.

The DVD set is packed with commentary and extras.  This, along, with a great premise, excellent acting and writing-it is worth the price.  I can't wait for the remaining three seasons to be released.",1157068800,11,1090,4.315270935960591
2531359,5,B000ERVJKO,"In my younger days, in the early Seventies, everyday after school, my friends and I would gather around the TV to watch reruns of ""The Wild Wild West."" It was our favorite show on television and Robert Conrad was our idol.

Robert Conrad played Secret Service Agent ""James West,"" who, along with his sidekick Artemus Gordon (Ross Martin), would, each episode, save America from some villainous megalomaniac.

The show was formulaic but if the formula works, what's wrong with that? You could count on West being captured at least once each episode, just as you could count on him using some gadget hidden in his clothes or the boot of his shoe to escape.  And there was always going to be some gorgeous female in league with the villain who would be won over by Jim West's looks and charm.

Robert Conrad as James West was the perfect combination of a man's man and a lady's man.

If they made TV shows like this now-a-days, I might turn on the television more often.",1156982400,3,967,4.566473988439307

2531363,5,B000ERVJKO,"Perhaps I was one of the few people who watched this series for Ross Martin...Jim was clever and a great man to have in a fight, but Artemus was my man: inventor, actor, master of disguise, bon vivant. In the first season, as Susan Kessler mentions in her WWW book, Artie was given a bit of short shrift in the self-defense department, but that was amended a bit in later seasons. The show hadn't quite decided what it wanted to be in the first season, Western or spy spoof, so the scripts varied wildly, but there was always a Dr. Loveless episode to save the day. I hope the rest of the series is released, since my favorite episodes are in season 2--and we still haven't seen ""Night of the Lord of the Limbo"" with a bravura performance by Ricardo Montalban.

Also, to ""raysin,"" who complained that the titles had been ""politically corrected,"" they were not. In the first season titles Jim did not punch out the girl who tried to stab him; it is implied by her big grin that his kiss is so devastating that it is all that is needed to deter her--much more subtle and also hinting at Jim's preference for the ladies.",1156118400,3,1117,4.396135265700483

2531405,5,B000ERVJKO,"Good things, they say, come to those who wait. Occasionally comes something like these DVDs to prove that the patient are not fools.  ""The Wild Wild West"" shines brightly in television's golden age. Those old enough to remember the series during its original run will recover here fond memories of a time when TV did not scale itself down to the public's lowest common denominator. Those whose only acquaintance with the name is through a miserable movie, starring Will Smith, should not--repeat not--judge this package by its cover. Here is classic entertainment that never dates: a program conceived to ride the Bond craze of the mid-60s, yet quickly developed an original, unique style all its own. Each of the twenty-eight episodes is hugely entertaining, featuring most of the finest character actors of the period: most notably, Ross Martin (Artemus Gordon) and Michael Dunn (Dr. Loveless).  Sadly, neither is still with us, though their joyous performances live on. Bob Conrad (Jim West) remains with us, however, and introduces each episode. With allowance for the fact that so little historical documentation of this forty-year-old series remains, the special features accompanying the discs rival in quality those one would find in a DVD set for an A-movie of that era. The whole pacakage is superior value for money: top-drawer production of first-rate entertainment.

2531408,5,B000ERVJKO,"In the mid-1960's the Western genre - while still boasting top-rated shows such as ""Bonanza"" and ""Gunsmoke"" - was nonetheless going into decline. In the film industry, meanwhile, the ""James Bond"" mania was at its height, providing television with a series of copycats such as ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" and ""I Spy"". In 1965, the executives at CBS-TV gave the green light to a seemingly bizarre combination of the Western and the spy film, and ""The Wild Wild West"" was born. The muscular Robert Conrad played James West, the Secret Service's top agent, who was sent to the Old West by President Grant to stop a never-ending array of mad scientists, would-be dictators, desperadoes, and all sorts of villains from conquering the Western United States. Traveling with him was fellow agent Artemus Gordon (Ross Martin), West's dapper sidekick and a master of disguise. They rode on a personal train that was the 1870's equivalent of the Batmobile, and which was equipped with an arsenal of clever gadgets which West and Gordon used to get themselves out of trouble when the need arose. Despite the series' eccentric storyline, the show was an instant hit, and ran on CBS for four years.

As someone who loved watching reruns of ""The Wild Wild West"" as a kid on weekday afternoons, I couldn't wait to buy this DVD set of the show's first season. And, as most of the other reviewers have posted, I wasn't disappointed. The episodes (the first season was shot in black-and-white) are sharp and clear, the sound is excellent, and the special features are adequate. I have seen a number of my favorite childhood TV shows on DVD, and in many cases I have been disappointed by how cheesy or silly the shows appear now that I am an adult. However, ""The Wild Wild West"" is actually better than I remembered - each episode is cleverly written, the villains (often played by top stars such as Martin Landau and Leslie Nielsen) are superb, and the personal chemistry between Robert Conrad and Ross Martin is genuine. Indeed, it is obvious as you watch this series that these two actors really liked each other and enjoyed their roles. As other reviewers have noted, the best episodes are often those starring dwarf actor Michael Dunn as Dr. Miguelito Loveless, a power-mad genius whose inventions (such as television!) are decades ahead of their time, and whose rage against James West and his ""perfect"" manly physique makes him the perfect foil for our heroes. The character of Dr. Loveless proved to be so popular that he starred in four episodes during the first season, and would wind up starring in ten episodes overall. The DVD's extra features include an audio introduction of each episode by Robert Conrad, a 1978 interview with Robert Conrad and Ross Martin on a morning talk show called ""Every Day"", a series of TV spots promoting the show, an audio recording of the soundtrack sessions for the show's unique theme music, and even one of the famous ""Eveready"" battery TV Commericials done by Robert Conrad in the 1970's (""C'Mon, knock it off, I dare ya!""). This DVD set is well worth the money, and I anxiously await the release of the second season on DVD. Highly Recommended!",1154908800,5,3170,4.805860805860806

2531412,5,B000ERVJKO,"""The Wild Wild West"" was a great series, and the 7 DVD set of the complete first season gives the fans what they deserve.  The picture has been remastered and the shows look great, and the sound is very good as well.  Each disk contains four episodes, as well as some special features.  The first season was in black and white, and contained 28 1 hour episodes, including the first four Dr. Miguelito Loveless episodes.  The shows vary from some almost standard westerns to some almost science fiction or James Bond in the old west style episodes.

If the 28 first season episodes are not enough, don't worry because the set is loaded with extras.  Robert Conrad gives a brief audio introduction to each episode, and there are three audio interviews with John Kneubuhl (a writer and the creator of Dr. Loveless), as well as audio interviews with Ethel Winant (casting), Fred Freiberger (producer), Tim Smyth (special effects), and Richard Markowitz (Music).  There is a joint appearance of Robert Conrad and Ross Martin from 1978 on a show called ""Every Day"".  There is also a music feature of some scoring sessions.  There are several smaller features too, such as a network promo, an Eveready commercial, an intro blooper, and that type of thing.

There are many guest stars during this season, such as Suzanne Pleshette, James Gregory, Richard Kiel, Sigrid Valdis, Leslie Nielsen, Martin Landau, Burgess Meredith, Don Rickles, and many more.  The strength of the series, though, lies in the chemistry between Robert Conrad (James T. West) and Ross Martin (Artemus Gordon).  Another strength of the series was in the creation of a nemesis in Michael Dunn's character, Dr. Miguelito Loveless.

In one of the audio introductions, Robert Conrad talks about how the show wasn't originally intended to be a James Bond type show, but that is rather difficult to believe.  Even the names of the main characters are very similar; James Bond vs. James West.  If it was originally conceived as a take-off of James Bond, it certainly did it in a smart way by changing the time and place of the events.  The show does take a few episodes to find the right feel, in some of the earlier episodes Artemus is almost a Q type character in providing gadgets for James West, but the foundation of the partnership is there.  If you are a fan, then you will definitely like what they have delivered; if you are new to the series, sit back and enjoy.",1153958400,6,2430,4.761336515513126

Well just plain old quality, inventive stories, good direction, interesting guest stars just about every week and those action scenes that at times went on forever. When this DVD became available I did not hesitate to buy it, and I'm not dissapointed, this show is actually BETTER than I remember it, and the re-runs must have been cut up quite a bit because there is a lot of material that I don't remember seeing in these episodes. Robert Conrad was perfectly cast as James T West and Ross Martin is a real treat as Artemus Gordon, they play off of one another so well, true, due somewhat to the material but I believe these guys really enjoyed what they were doing, and it shows. Eagerly awaiting the remaining seasons releases on DVD, my favorite seasons are the 3rd and 4th, 3rd being the best of the series overall.

I realize that the show is 40 years old, but there must be some film that could be included as well as the audio interviews.

I am grateful for the comments Robert Conrad made about Ross Martin and Michael Dunn.  It is so nice to hear things about the two of them as people.

2531464,5,B000ERVJKO,"I'd forgotten how much fun this show was. The critics hated it but gave good reviews to actors Robert Conrad and Ross Martin for their performances. As James West and Artemus Gordon they were the perfect crime-fighting duo. The almost superhuman Jim West provided the physical heroics, sporting the most perfectly-formed physique ever captured on film. In just about every episode they found a reason for him to take his shirt off, and when he did it made you want to run down to the nearest gym and start working out. Every guy just wanted to BE him!

Artemus Gordon supplied the master of disguise element and comic relief needed to round out the cast and storylines.

Whether you love or hate this show you have to admit it's different, taking the James Bond syndrome and placing it in the days of the old west. Wild Wild West forms a kind of bridge between two eras. It came along at a time when westerns were going out of fashion and spy stories were in. It's quite unique, and that alone makes it worth a look.

It is a very good quality and has nice special features before each episode. I wish that the interviews of those involved in the production of the show were video interviews, rather than audio only.

I wish we had some actual footage of Robert Conrad as he is today rather than his (non-visual) verbal introductions...But that's just being nitpicky.  This is a wonderful series, one of the more imaginative creations of a very creative 60's.  Though some episodes here and there show their age, the WWW remains very much worth pursuing.

And a final note: While this season was filmed in Black and White (the only season done in this format), the WWW, in my opinion, benefitted from its subsequent conversion to color (unlike, say, Perry Mason!).",1152316800,3,856,4.985915492957746
2531498,5,B000ERVJKO,"I grew up watching The Wild Wild West. So when I discovered the first season was to be released on DVD I started salivating. But I was also wary. I mean, I remember the show through the eyes of an eight- or nine-year-old. What would I think about it now nearly 40 years later? (Cases in point: Time Tunnel -- cool as a kid, nearly unwatchable now. Or Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea...ditto.)

Frankly, I'm blown away by The Wild Wild West -- now more than ever. It holds up. And, in fact, surpasses contemporary TV shows for sheer imagination and storytelling. This was an incredible show. And still is thanks to the magic of DVD.

Star Robert Conrad narrates an introduction to every episode and I'm so thankful that he did. If there's one star in Hollywood that I'd love to meet it's Robert Conrad. I've been a fan of his for, literally, four decades. So it's great to hear his voice providing recollections and behind-the-scenes factoids about the episode. Thank you, Mr. Conrad!

Speaking of Mr. C. -- holy cow! -- the man is astonishingly dapper. Toned to perfection. Abs (and cojones) of steel. He did all of his own stunts. And some of them were extremely difficult (like hanging upside down in a straightjacket and then lifting himself up with nothing but his abs to support him while he untied his feet...or scaling a vertical wall with a rope, or just his fingertips). All of his athleticism was probably lost on me as a kid. But now I watch him and think, ""Wow. I can't believe he just did that.""

My wife and I watched every episode as soon as we got the box set home. She had never seen the series before. Probably never even heard of it. But she was as thrilled by the episodes as I was.

Ross Martin as Artemus Gordon was the perfect counterpoint to Robert Conrad's super-suave James West. The two have a delightful chemistry. Ross was a great character actor and it was always fun to see him show up in some improbable costume with a new accent -- often just in time to save Jim.

The stories! Unreal. Way ahead of their time. A combination of Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and the Old West. With a bit of the dire espionage of 24 thrown in for good measure.

The villians! I never forgot Michael Dunn as recurring bad guy Dr. Miguelito Loveless. It was great to see him again in these episodes.

The women! To my mind, James West was much cooler than James Bond. His quips and come-ons are fantastic. Once my wife figured out the ""format,"" she always watched for the beautiful woman to appear -- be she the villian's daughter, neice, or wife. At some point, a gorgeous woman will appear and James West will be all over her like white on rice.

The theme song! Unforgettable. One of the best ever created for television.

The opening sequence graphics! Clever. The various panels are replaced with frozen images from the episode, sort of counting down to the finale. My only quibble with the opening animation is that these DVDs appear to use the PC version -- the one in which James West doesn't wallop the woman with the dagger about to do him in. That version is provided. But it's not used to open each episode.

I can't praise The Wild Wild West DVD box set enough. This is an amazing collection of episodes that entertain, delight, and amaze to this day.

Robert Conrad was my hero when I was eight. He still is, nearly 40 years later.

Thank you to one and all for releasing The Wild Wild West on DVD!

Now...

How about Season Two?  :)",1152144000,16,3447,4.430379746835443
2531499,5,B000ERVJKO,"Some of you may know me for my tongue-in-cheek reviews of bad movies, but my tongue is out of my cheek and wagging over this amazing dvd set of the Wild, Wild West's first season.  I remember watching WWW as a kid (the ""Kraken"" episode with Ted Knight scared me more than ""Jaws"") and have been a fan ever since.  I've set numerous VCR programs over the years, trying to catch early-morning repeats on TNN and other networks and have several VHS tapes crudely marked ""Wild Wild West!  Do Not Touch!""  Now I can finally throw them out thanks to this amazing set of dvds, the first of hopefully all four WWW's seasons.

  I have numerous box sets of TV shows: Buck Rogers, American Gothic, Battlestar Galactica, etc. and NONE of them have what the WWW set has: SINGLE SIDED DVDs!  Yes!  The picture and sound quality are amazing!  And the bonus features are really stellar: Robert Conrad himself introduces each and every episode, often with a little nugget of information about the episode in question.  There are audio interviews with the show's creators and a really awesome segment of an interview done in 1978 featuring Conrad, Ross Martin and show stuntman Red West (yup, of Elvis' ""Sonny & Red"").  That interview featuring Conrad and Martin is worth the price of the dvd set, just to see how these men genuinely liked working with each other.  Well, the chemistry comes through on the screen too: Artemis Gordon and James West were the original ""Buddy Team"" and they have stood the test of time to remain the small screen's best.

  In conclusion, if you want to learn to love an excellent show with excellent production values, excellent stars all in an perfectly packaged dvd set, invest a few dollars and buy this boxed set.  I'm sure this set will win a few awards in 2006.  You will not be disappointed.  Just don't tell Dr. Loveless I said he was a bad dancer.",1151884800,10,1870,4.595166163141994
2531500,5,B000ERVJKO,"oh thank you paramount for this release of one of t.v.'s better offerings during the 60's or really any time! this show would still be a ratings king if it were released today!

  the plot is as enteraining as it is simple, in the 1870's the u.s. is still getting over the civil war,and we need people who can fight the many villians who want to distroy the country. president grant brings in captian james t. west and friend artemus gordon(robert conrad and ross martin) to travel the u.s. in a very special railroad car and fight evil where ever it may crop up. simple idea made fantastic by all who were involved in this series. this was james bond in the west and it was a hit from the word go! forget the waste of time and insulting will smith piece of junk and see the concept as it was ment to be done. always with pretty girl in tow and gadgets at the ready to take on any badman who threatened the country west and gordon were an unbeatable pair and their adventures were beyond compair.

  one of the best parts of the show was the villians,many of which would have thrown bond for a loop,and the best of all was the dwarf miguelito loveless played by the renaissance man michael dunn who was only small in body not in talent! mr. dunn was the gleefully evil villian who was always a match for west and one of t.v.'s best villians ever! his malevolence was from the idea that his family was really the people who should own most of the west and he wanted what was his! he was the blofield to west's bond and the two actors were having a ball together as you could tell watching! mr. dunn was by far one of the best actors in hollywood and with this show he was able to shine as the unkillible dr.loveless,and he gets five shows in the first season to ply his evil trade.

  the extras are very good(all in the form of audio,from conrad and the shows living producers and a few other pieces of video that are great) and to top it off we get robert conrad' everready battery ads.

  this is what fans have waited 40 years for, the chance to take west and company home and watch when we want to.

2531501,3,B000ERVJKO,"When this show premiered I  was 10 and loved this show  beyond words.  Watching the DVD set some 40 years later.....well, it doesn't  hold up that well...sadly.  BTW in one of the BEST episodes the villian declared that he is protected by his SOLID RUBBER PANTS!  That villian  is the delicously evil DR Loveless..the singularly BEST villian in film or TV history IMHO!

The episodes that feature the talented Michael Dunn as the evil DR are priceless and 5 stars are not enough!  Most of the other episodes feature the same inane plots with diminutive Robert Conrad  (Jim West) beating the hell out of dozens of bad guys while turning bad girls into spellbound kittens with one gaze! Conrad is sort of a James Dean with a six pack but frankly his ""i love myself smirk"" works less for an adult viewer than it did for a 10 year old who figured he  was USAs James Bond!  The never ugly part of my review was that there isn't seemingly a single woman in any episode that isn't a beauty queen...and the western towns are the cleanest (although they seemingly are the same town)....you can imagine.

This may seem like a harsh review and believe me I'm not happy to be writing it...I wish all the episodes were of the same caliber as the Loveless episodes and a few others.  Fun though this series is....and its fun  to spot the future stars , from Robert Loggia to Katherine Ross and Leslie Nielsen...I can't honestly say this is great storytelling or that creative....just kinda formulaic....which it shouldn't be and particularly in the FIRST season.

The prints of the episodes are very good and that is one of the better parts of the package...the intros by Robert Conrad don't add much if anything and the brief clip from an old talk show with Conrad and Ross Martin is kinda fun although a reminder of Conrads oversized ego.  Surprisingly this series holds up for me less well than than Cheyenne or Rawhide or Wanted Dead or ALive or Have Gun Will Travel....all out on DVD.

Again...the highs on this package are brilliant, but the majority is formulaic and dull.",1151798400,9,2065,4.610958904109589
2531502,4,B000ERVJKO,"It is wonderful to be able to watch these episodes again, frankly a couple I don't remember ever seeing. I have been suprised how well the show has held up after 40 years. While as an actor Robert Conrad pushes his ""Leading Man"" position a bit, it should be noted that was the style of the time (i.e. William Shatner). The series as a whole is a somewhat ""campy"", admittedly thats half the fun. In many ways it is Americas answer to the Britsh ""Avengers""!  Having watched the 1st season what I really noticed is how orginal, intelligent and well written the scripts are. I also love the music and framing of each (act?)commerical break with the Sketch art motif. Yes I agree the series is not historically accurate, but I still contend it is likely plausible in terms of fiction.

2531504,5,B000ERVJKO,"This great series is finally available on DVD collections by seasons. ""The Wild, Wild West"" was one of the last successful Western television shows, coming on right as the era of the great Western TV show was coming to an end.

Its success was due to the fact that not only was it exciting and action-packed, but it was a curious meld of traditional Western action, espionage, science fiction, and high camp. It was in equal parts a product of its time as a Western, such as ""Gunsmoke"" and ""Bonanza,"" a semi-serious, lots of camp spy show like ""I-Spy,"" ""The Man From UNCLE,"" and ""The Avengers,"" science fiction like ""Star Trek"" and ""Voyage To The Bottom of the Sea,"" and sophomoric camp like ""Batman.""  Robert Conrad and Ross Martin made a formidable team as US Secret Service agents James West and Artemis Gordon, as they travelled all over the West in their personal locomotive thwarting the schemes and intrigues of power-mad scientists and ruthless governments.

This show is near and dear to a lot of us who grew up in the mid to late 60's, and it is a joy to watch this episodes and remember that while the world was not a simple, carefree place, our living rooms could be while watching shows like ""The Wild, Wild West.""",1151366400,9,1227,4.593607305936073
2531545,1,B000ERVJKO,"The menu layout of this 40th Anniversary Edition DVD set is especially irratating. There is no ""play all"" option. Instead, to get to each and every episode, one has to repeatedly press ""play"" through a series of menu screens - a main menu, often a second menu, and still another to avoid a voice intro by Robert Conrad.

To make matters worst, there is really no reason for either the second menu screen or the Robert Conrad intro - he rarely says anything that interesting and what he does say could have been made a less intrusive comment voice-over menu option like that found on other DVD's.

Beyond that, Wild Wild West fans will enjoy the familiar episodes aired decades ago. Since you already know what you're getting, this review is intended instead for those who have never seen the show. This mid-60's (first season B&W) television series focuses on two government secret service agents chasing bad guys in the western United States during the late 1800's. Before you get too excited, that premise is far more interesting than the implimentation.

The actual show itself is preposterously inaccurate, with gasoline engine military tanks, wireless radios, exploding bullets, robots, electricity, electric chairs, and so on, decades before any of this was actually invented. On top of that, there are implausible scientists, junk science, nonsense conspiracies, an invisible bad guy, a mad puppeteer, an absurd midget genus, too many ugly women, obviously faked fight scenes, and a ton of bad acting.

And then there is Jim West (played by Robert Conrad) laughably dressed like some kind of spanish bull fighter in frilly shirts, baby blue waist jacket, and matching baby blue skin tight pants - with a cowboy hat. Ross Martin, playing the second agent (Artemus Gordon), tries almost desperately to add a little humor to all this, but he is no great comedian and his scripts are just not that funny.

All in all, it is not that difficult to see why this is not a television classic aired repeatedly by the networks today. Whether you will enjoy the show like the many fans is difficult to say. I suggest you try a few episodes (from the library or wherever) before buying. To increase the odds of potential enjoyment, forget any resemblance of reality and employ an almost child-like sense of humor. As for myself, I give the show itself two stars (since some are certain to like any show, no matter how bad, I rarely give one star), but then subtract an additional star for the poor menu options. As such, this is one of the very few DVD's given a single star by me.

Note: This DVD set was given to me as a gift, which is how several not-so-hot DVD's ended up in my collection. It appears the gift giver, knowing my appreciation for old television and movie classics, decided to find something I might have watched years ago and was mislead by the rave reviews of the fans here. Since there are clearly many others like myself, who never liked this television series, I decided it was time for an alternative viewpoint - if for no reason beyond preventing others from giving this as a gift based solely on rave reviews by fans.",1151193600,8,3137,4.736263736263736
2531546,4,B000ERVJKO,"The Wild Wild West...wow. This four and a 1/2 star release caught me by total surprise. One of my all time top shows,when I saw it I just HAD to have it.
A kind of James Bond goes west,every week it offered up a new and different adventure. And for TV of the time these adventures were VERY different from the norm. It successfully blended the western with bizarre people,plots and gadgets. The writers generally gave us quite a wild ride but a believable and imaginative one.
The leads played by Robert Conrad and Ross Martin were done perfectly.
The movie with the same name released in recent years sadly was as far removed from the feel and essence of the TV show as the distance from Earth to Alpha Centauri. No comparison.
The show ran a respectable four years but when Ross Martin had to bow out awhile due to bad health it spelled the eventual demise of the series. Conrad on his own couldn't shoulder the whole show, his replacement was weak and made you long all the more for Ross Martin. By the time Mr. Martin did return ratings had fallen considerably and unfortunately the show couldn't make up for the lost ground.
While I'm very happy to see this set out and know they will be followed by subsequent seasons,seasons three and four are especially going to prove tough. They don't possess the quality of this season and the next one. But to devotees of this show that probably won't matter.
Technically this set has been cleaned and spruced up to almost perfection. It's certainly a solid looker,no doubt about it. Kudos to the tech team who did the job.
The set has many extras mentioned in previous reviews so I won't go into them here. The only reason I didn't give this a five star rating is that there are no scene selection options. This is the first release of this type that I've seen with no scene selector. It's a minor concern to be sure because the forward button gets you where you want to go just as quick if need be anyways.
In conclusion this very welcome DVD release of one of the better shows of the 1960s is back and in better-than-ever shape. The shows are a joy to watch not only for their imaginative scripting but also the wonderful acting and chemistry of its' leads. It was original for its' time and it still stands up today.

2531548,5,B000ERVJKO,"TV series from the mid-60's were some of the best ever produced, e.g., Star Trek, The Outer Limits, and now (finally)...The Wild, Wild West.

The picture quality, sound, and presentation of this DVD package is excellent. But it's the creative boldness of the show, coupled with an outstanding cast (both Conrad and Martin of course, plus a whole host of talented and lovely guest stars), that makes this series great.

Nostalgia is an important factor for many of us, but four decades later this show not only holds up very well, it absolutely sparkles.

I recommended tracking down Sue Kessler's long out-of-print guidebook to enhance the overall TWWW experience. Kessler thankfully participated in this DVD as well, just one of the thoughtful touches to make the First Season a joy.

This DVD release has created quite a buzz (an Amazon top seller), including becoming instant sellouts at our local Best Buy and Target stores. If any indication, this wonderful and mesmerizing show is a hit once again and we hopefully can look forward to the next three seasons being released in the near future.

It's hard to imagine nowadays how a hit show like TWWW could have been canceled by CBS executives. Was it Martin's depature for health reasons? Budgetary considerations? The level of violence in each episode? We may never know for sure...

Anyway, we can now be glad to have this boxed set in our hands and the discs in our DVD players. A true ""classic"" in every sense of the word, TWWW is so entertaining on so many different levels. It simply is a briliant series that has endured for 40 years, and judging by the success of this initial release, it will continue to do so for many, many years to come.

2531550,4,B000ERVJKO,"I must admit to being mildly disappointed at the extras in this DVD. There is no ""making of"" featurette and only one partial interview of Conrad and Martin taken from an talk show as the first TV movie sequel was coming out. The other extras include audio-only interviews of various behind-the-scenes people. At least they prove somewhat interesting albeit sometimes hard to hear.

The best extra turns out to be Robert Conrad's brief introductions (audio-only) to each episode and his commentary accompanying the premiere episode. His voice is breathy, bretraying his 70 years, but he has the same in-your-face spirit. Still, it is probably fortunate we don't see him on-camera, adjacent to the youthful, virile star of the series.

So, a quality print of the first season of this series is the main reason for buying this DVD (even in black & white, this is a fantastic show to watch). And, the wonderful sound-track (I bet you can summon up the theme song at will, too, just by imagining the clever animated opening-credits). And, to enjoy the vital chemistry between the two stars. And, to appreciate the stories before the formula became too ingrained.

Consider this: this show preceded the Diana Rigg version of THE AVENGERS to the Amercian screens (which shares much of its fantasy style) and Jim West's karate-chopping preceded THE GREEN HORNET's Kato.",1150416000,3,1361,5.013274336283186

Everything from the re-mastering of audio and video, the menu layout, to all of the features, this is just beautiful!! It is enjoyable when the actors sit down, watch an episode, and comment on it. After 40+ years, it is so gratifying to listen to Robert Conrad's comments and reactions to the first episode. This was one of the main reasons I bought the Wild, Wild, West DVD. If and when the second season becomes available, maybe Mr. Conrad would consider being ""on-screen"" while giving his commentary on a couple of episodes! This was done on The Dukes of Hazzard DVD. It showed all three actors in a little box on screen watching an episode with you while you were watching it. Features like that really make a DVD worth it.

His love of television is obvious in his brilliant work on DVD sets for shows like THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW, GUNSMOKE and now THE WILD WILD WEST.

That's especially true of this incredible boxed set, which includes amazing extras like the audio tracks from the original scoring sessions for the main title theme with alternate versions and aborted takes (a rare find which is worth the price of the set alone),  the original pilot main title sequence, network promos, and audio interviews with the composer, various writers,  the studio casting exec, special effects person.

2531607,5,B000ERVJKO,"Probably the best tv viewing memories I have as a kid were those of watching ""The Wild Wild West"" on Friday nights with my dad. Of course while in school on Fridays the weekend was never far from my thoughts and I knew that Jim and Artie would kick it off perfectly by foiling the plans of that weeks villain. Bonanza?, Gunsmoke?, Maverick?... sorry, I could never really get into them. They were just a bit too predictable ( i.e. boring ) for my tastes and for other kids I hung around with. When we were tearing up our neighborhood with cap gun six shooters it wasn't one of the Cartwrights or Matt Dillon we were pretending to be, it was James West!

This 40th aninversary dvd set's packaging is excellent, the picture quality in the episodes I've seen so far is virtually pristine, and the bonus features are great as well. The audio commentaries by Robert Conrad before each episode are wonderful and bring some good insight as do the commentaries by a few of the shows writers (who knew that having a few pops before sitting down at the typewriter could be so helpful to the creative process?). From my youth I can only recall the episodes filmed in color (the second season and onward) but all the great action and storylines of this first season shine right through in these beautiful black and white print transfers.

Of course, we had the opportunity to listen the series in Spanish and later through Cable TV we at last hear the real voices and enjoy it even more.

2531609,2,B000ERVJKO,"I can't help but notice no other review for this at a 3/5 or below, so I will tread lightly. I had no prior knowledge of the show and went out on a limb after being blow away by the Big Valley. I had hoped for a second strike of light'ning though, that wasn't to be. I find the Wild, Wild West a bit cornball and in general lacks charisma. The way the show is filmed leaves a lot to be desired, the black and white hurts it (especially in light of the BEAUTIFUL cover art). Sadly, this was shot the year before color would rule the earth and in turn the series feels stilted and the casting aside from Conrad and Ross feels the same way. The villains almost feel, dare I say, like something from the fifties (like from the Superman series, circa 1952, not that this is necessarily a BAD thing if this appeals to you). Cartoon cut-outs without any real qualities beyond needing to be thwarted. The show lacks a coherant structure and direction and in general terms, there are just better things I could be watching.

I give the show props for its use of props but that can only go so far. The extras are quite nice, but when you don't care for the show it doesn't add up to much. I do like Conrad and think the show probably gets better but I cannot endorse this first season, it just feels ""off"". I guess my biggest gripe is a real lack of ""cast"". With primarily only Conrad and Ross at the helm the show rides primarily on the backs of the villians and guest stars, this is where I can say the Wild, Wild West squarely drops the ball. The guests are so inconsistant it becomes difficult to watch; then other times you will be treated to a Suzanne Pleshette and will be delighted.

I suspect 99% of the people here were fans of the show before this set was released, if you weren't I suggest treading lightly. Sorry if I'm stepping on people spurs on this one but I call 'em as I see 'em. Sometimes you have to know when to fold 'em, that time, is now. Looking at what others have bought that also bought this I see another show I didn't care for; Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. Both of these shows lack a certain spark and consistancy I like. If you liked VTTBOTS, then by all means buy this, they feel similar.

One thing does sadden me about Amazon reviewers; people are not willing to conceed every show is not for everyone and instantly give a ""not helpful"". I recognize some shows I like are more from a nostalgic ""eye"", sadly others cannot do the same.",1149811200,20,2461,4.231914893617021

I've already bought two sets from Amazon, and there are a lot of people who are going to get this from me as a present.  I can hardly wait for seasons 2, 3 and 4 to come out in this same format.

2531612,5,B000ERVJKO,"I remember seeing this popular series when I was a young child and had forgotten how enjoyable The Wild Wild West really was. The series cashed in on the James Bond movies made during the mid-60's, but creatively altered the setting and the theme quite successfully.

This first set is loaded with extras including interviews, promos, alternate title sequences, opening narrations by Bob Conrad, etc. The recorded interview with Ethel Winant, CBS Executive, has some interesting revelations about the making of the series, story ideas, and she includes some rather amusing comments about Robert Conrad's ""lifts"" in his boots and the habit of placing him in the foreground of a medium or long shot to make him appear taller! (Ah, the illusion that is television!)

The accolades on the individual episodes have already been discussed by fellow Amazon reviewers; nonetheless; this is a superb set complete with Bob Conrad's now infamous ""Everready"" battery commercial, ""C'mon I Dare You..."" lampooned by Johnny Carson on the ""Tonight Show"" for years.

Moreover, Ross Martin was a truly underappreciated actor regulated to guest roles on too many excellent prime-time programs like ""Columbo"" (see ""Suitable for Framing""), yet his presence on The Wild,Wild West is clearly visible and demonstrates his tremendous range as a true ""character actor."" A truly gifted performer, Martin spoke seven languages fluently and was classically trained musician in the violin.

I look forward to purchasing the other installments once they are available. This set of the first season is in black & white. Lots of recognizable guest stars too--including Victor Buono and a young and lovely (pre-Bob Newhart Show) Suzanne Pleshette, seen in the pilot episode. No disrespect to William Smith, of Fontana, CA., but it's just a TV show--like the spy spoofs that lampooned the Bond films (Our Man Flint, In Like Flint, etc.) and the Bond films themselves--were never meant to depict espionage accurately or realistically--they are, in the words of the great Italian literary critic and author, Umberto Eco, myth and ""espionage entertainments"" and nothing more.  I see the Wild Wild West in a similar light--a lampoon of the traditional Western--but with a twist--and hey, from a commerical standpoint it worked!",1149724800,3,2288,5.292011019283747

Can I tell you how many times I've browsed the shelves and webpages looking for this to be available? Those of you who share my passion will understand, the rest of you, just take a look and you'll be hooked.

In my opinion, the best western, sci-fi, secret agent show ever made.  My all time favorite episode -
""The Night of The Man Eating House"" (1966)

The recent movie was such a disappointment, completely undeserving of the title. I've been wracking my brain for years trying to come up with current actors capable of recreating these roles and I never could. Robert Conrad and Ross Martin were made to play these roles.

Now we can see the originals once again... And they look great! Newly restored, crisp clean prints. The show never looked so good. I'm really pleased with the Complete 1st Season Edition. CBS and Paramount Home Video did a great job with this one. Packaging is sharp with some great color publicity photos on the box set and on each case cover. Extras include audio intros and commentary by Robert Conrad, supplemental archive promos, scoring recording sessions, numerous interviews, and much more.
Let's hope to hear much more from Robert Conrad on future season releases.

It is REALLY confirming to see this title open in the top 5 of all Amazon DVD sales and see that it has risen to #2 in 2 days! Can #1 be far off?

Anyone know of a definitive fan club? I'd like to continue the discussion and celebration with fellow fans.

2531646,5,B000ERVJKO,"I loved ""The Wild Wild West"" as a kid. This innovative example of genres cross pollinating made for entertaining TV in an era where networks used the tried and true to drive their ratings. ). From the moment that Richard Markowitz's rip roaring theme sprang to life you knew you were in good hands as you watched a series of misadventures occur to a cartoon character cowboy in action presented in comic book panels.

Robert Conrad plays Jim West and the late Ross Martin Artemus Gordon two secret service agents that travel the country in a train handling unusual missions for President Grant. I suppose you could say this is like ""Mission: Impossible"" with spurs and cowboy hats but the real inspiration was probably the Bond films with all their gadgets. Jim West always has some unusual gadget to get him out of a jam. The writers for the show created a fun adventure series and found their best and most memorable villian early in the form of Miguelito Loveless (the late Michael Dunn)a brilliant but twisted genius. Loveless, West and Gordon fight throughout the entire run of the series. Dunn's portrayal and the writing make him more than an evil genius but a complex villian in a time of black and white good guys and bad guys. While Conrad is more the focus of the show with his action sequences (he did the stunts himself)the marvelous Ross Martin more than holds his own playing a variety of characters in disguise. The first season sets the tone for the show but the show really hit its stride with season two and three (the bulk of season two and all of season three were shot in color).

Let me be honest here I haven't had a chance to dig through all the discs here but what I've seen has been great. It's great to finally have this classic series on DVD after years of waiting. It seems that CBS/Paramount has more of a committment to providing nice extras with these sets.

Previously available on DVD from Columbia House in decent but dirty transfers, Paramount has cleaned up the source material for this DVD set improving the picture quality enormously. Although the picture is occasionally soft and contrast could be better the black and white images (the show was shot in color for the bulk of the second season) look surprisingly robust with crisp images and rich, dark blacks. The audio is presented in its original mono format and sounds remarkably good with dialogue coming across crystal clear. Sure the audio could probably have been spiffed up a bit more (it occasionally sounds a bit flat) but on the whole the presentation of the show is a marked improvement over the previous DVDs.

I'm a bit surprised that Paramount sprung for all the extras included here despite the fact that most of them come from their vaults. It's a terrific extras packed set. First we get the lost original opening for the show. We also get a Ross Martin sketch (I wasn't aware that Martin was an artist but he used to sketch out his character and work with make up for the look of his character), network promos, scoring sessions for the theme, photo galleries and the opening and bumpers used for the show between commercial breaks. There's also Conrad and Martin appearing on the TV show ""Every Day"" to promote the series (which I haven't looked at yet), includes the Everready commericals. Conrad also provides a couple of audio introductions for a number of episodes and we get audio interviews with various people involved in the production of the show including producer/writer Fred Freiberger, special effects technician Tim Smyth and composer Richard Markowitz.

Filled with gadgets that James Bond would have loved, fascinating plots and fun performances ""The Wild Wild West"" had its memory tarnished by a horrific Barry Sonnenfeld film that I'm sure Will Smith (and Kevin Kline) are still trying to forget. Secret Service Agents James T. West (Robert Conrad) and Artemus Gordon use their skills to protect the United States from villains such as the diminutive brilliant but disturbed dwarf Migulito Loveless (the late great Michael Dunn ). Roaming around in a customized train to troubled spots across the country the duo encounters some truly unusual mysteries. The fantastic stories that drove this ""western"" included everything from aliens arriving in a small town to monsters preying on the innocent. Of course West and Gordon used gadgets, their fighting skills, six shooter (along with Gordon's ability to masquerade as others) to expose the bad guys and discover who or what was really behind the latest plot against the U.S. Government. The series continued to be popular up until its untimely demise in late 1969 and, in fact, inspired two mediocre TV movies of which the only highlight was seeing Conrad and the late Martin together again on the screen. The show was a major influence on the cult classic TV show ""The Adventures of Brisco Country Jr."" (which is coming to DVD in July).",1149638400,16,4916,4.806146572104019
2531647,5,B000ERVJKO,"Forty years ago, Wild WIld West was put on CBS TV.The media in that era included such movies and TV shows as  James Bond, Gunsmoke, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (Note NOT on DVD yet) and The Avengers...When you put those all together and you have Wild Wild West.

The show starred Robert Conrad as Agent James T. West with  Ross Martin as  his partner, Artemis Gordon. Conrad fresh of Hawaiian Eye, was slick in this role of Dandy West with his private car. The four  acts  of each show had a mini cliff hanger. I think I like West and UNCLE that what made the shows different. It gave the show the serial type of feel. I drew you in to solve the case in the last act

The interesting part of the show was the gadgets. Many gadgets were so inventive, the slick devise that had a gun in his heel of West's shoe or inventions of the villians West and Gordon faced...they weren't just simple guns.

 Also another  part of the show which I enjoyed was the wonderful way that West escaped all those death traps set up for him. MacGyver fans take note, this show was first!

Michael Dunn guest starred in 10 episodes during the show's run as Dr. Miguelito Loveless, West's nemesis and one the interesting villians. I loved Mr. Dunn performances from the movies Ship of Fools and Madigan and his guest appearance on Classic Star Trek. Here he hold his own with Robert Conrad's James West. Since he was a dwarf, i DONT THINK it would be in bad taste to say he stands toe to toe with Conrad and Ross...because his acting is perfect.  When he is on that TV screen  it holds you spell bound

I love  this seven disk DVD volume with  the extras (including Conrad's Everready Battery ads).Worth every penny to get this set

 So Paramount, You have 2 more MacGuyver volumes left (one being released in two weeks from now and the last in October)..so lets  get on the stick with West volume two and  future volumes of Mission Impossible (september 12th  will be the release of first season of MISSION)

(My Dad liked it second only to The Avengers with oh-so-lovely Diana Rigg.)  James Bond/Sean Connery came every year or so, but we could watch James West/Robert Conrad every Friday night at 7:30.  This show had it all--a Western spy thriller with occasional Jules Verne/science fiction elements.  Agents West and Gordon were buddies who complemented each other like Holmes/Watson, Aubrey/Maturin, Butch/Sundance, or Capt. Kirk/Spock.  Robert Conrad was the action hero with great fighting skill(martial arts and pistol whipping), spy gadgets(boot-knife, collar-knife, sleeved derringer, zip lines, and the train/armory Wanderer), good looks/sharp dresser, wit and charm.  Artemis Gordon was the cerebral agent with multiple disguises (Ulysses Grant with his pants down/ old Swedish handyman/ Mexican peasant) and new spy gadgets(television and the atomic bomb).  They saved the U.S. and world many times over from various oddball villains including Dr. Lovelace, Count Manzeppi, Voltaire, various demented Civil War generals, divas, counterfeiters, banditos, renegades, outlaws, yahoos, hard cases, and others.  Remember the Kraken, white elephants, the Sedgewick Curse, Nicodemis, torture chambers, simian killer apes, samurai assassins, trap doors, swinging bookcases and chandeliers, bubbling death pits, Jack O' Diamonds, and acid baths?  Remember exotic locales including the San Francisco waterfront/shanghai bars, Denver, the Mexican desert, ghost towns, and spooky voodoo New Orleans?  Remember the great theme music and commercial cut scenes? Remember Jeremy Pike and Pat Paulsen?

2531652,5,B000ERVJKO,"Thank God this great 60's classic is now on DVD. What made this show so great was it's mixing of the modern with antiquity. The show, done in a slick, James Bond-like style, was never overdone or exaggerated. The devices that Gordon and West used never took center stage, they were just props. This gave the show a sense of realism, while making it COOL at the same time. True, some of the devices may have stretched credulity a bit, but never in an obvious way. But most important of all, Martin and Conrad were awesome in their roles, each playing splendidly off the other. They were very believable in their parts and had a synergy between them. When Martin left due to illness the show definitely faltered, though it never sank.

The Will Smith movie however is an entirely different matter. It took the original's ideas, with it's James Bond coolness, and turned it into Inspector Gadget, or as Jim Kelly said in 'Enter The Dragon', ""something right out of a comic book"". Believability is replaced with the totally ridiculous, intelligence with stupidity, great acting with shameless hamminess, and let's face it gang, Will Smith ain't no Robert Conrad. It's a travesty that the movie has the same name as the TV show.

The series may not be to everyone's taste but this show was well ahead of it's time and was one of the inspirations for the X-files television series.  There are 28 different episodes from the first season, some of which I have never seen on television.  My guess is that CBS has released this DVD to test market reaction and if favorable, they will probably release the additional seasons.

For those of you who have seen the Will Smith vehicle of the same name, this is an almost entirely different animal; only the concept is the same.  My feeling is that the series would still make a great film idea, but only if direction/production was taken on by individuals who loved the original show.  Follow-up the aforementioned comments with a lead actor that could play the lead role in the sprit that Robert Conrad played James West and you would have a winner.

Lastly, I think the dark approach of both the television series and the movie are good; however, films taken from other formats that have their substance replaced with camp never make good movies (remember Batman & Robin).  In other words, if you have never seen the original Wild, Wild, West television series but thought that at least the film version's concept was good, this DVD is for you.

2531688,5,B000ERVJKO,"One of my favorite TV shows as a child and, when I heard it was coming to DVD, I checked marked it as a thing to do -- ""Buy THE WILD WILD WEST!!""

Can't say much more then anyone else. The sci-fi elements and fancifullness of each episode were enough to pull you in but, my goodness, add the chemistry, charm and good looks of both Robert Conrad and Ross Martin and you've certainly got a winner!

Conrad and Martin were the perfect buddy team. Not just partners in work, on that great train, but genuine pals. How many times did we hear one or the other character say ""He's like a brother to me""? How often did we see one or the other ride to their friend's rescue? 'course, in this day and age such closeness would be given a subtextual reference but I prefer to think of these gents as what they were -- Manly men, loyal Secret Service agents who loved their country, great food, beautiful women, adventure, the good life and - most of all - were devoted to each other!

Again, the ultimate buddy team and - tying them together with all the technical gadgetry and daring exploits - Conrad, Martin and TPTB made it all seem right!

June 6 can't get here quick enough!",1147392000,4,1169,4.3
2531689,5,B000ERVJKO,"Finally! It's about time. One of the greatest series in TV history has come to DVD. Growing up in the 60's, I waited in eager anticipation for each episode to air. Once it started I was glued to the TV set. The stunts that Conrad and 'his stuntmen' performed were great. Every episode was well-written. I especially enjoyed the appearance of Dr. Loveless. Those made for very amusing, yet interesting episodes. I'll relish this DVD package.

Now that this series and others, such as F-Troop, Hogan's Heroes and Green Acres are out on DVD, I'm wondering about Gomer Pyle. What's the hold up? Gomer Pyle was one of the greatest series on TV as well. Why has it yet to be released on DVD? Does anyone know? Anyway, it's great to finally get long-awaited series on DVD from the 60s.",1147219200,4,778,4.557142857142857
2531690,5,B000ERVJKO,"I used to watch this show when I was a kid and I loved every minute of it!  Been waiting forever it seems for WW West to be released (each season) on DVD.  Yes its been a long wait but I know it will be well worth it!  Finally the ""spies in spurs"" are back!",1146960000,4,257,3.6363636363636362
2531691,5,B000ERVJKO,"""High adventure"", ""action-packed"", ""baroque"", ""unique"",""fantastic""...these are just some of the adjectives that have been  used to describe The Wild Wild West. Take one part western, one  part spy adventure, add a dash of science fiction and a pinch of fantasy and you have the recipe for one of the most incomparible television programs ever broadcast.

Robert Conrad and Ross Martin were pure magic in their portrayals of Secret Service Agents James West and Artemus Gordon. West and Gordon are up there with Solo and Kuryakin, Kelly and Scott, Kirk and Spock and Steed and Peel as some of the best pairings of 60's television.
 Conrad may not have been a master thespian, even he's admitted that in interviews, but he was certainly one of the most handsomest and physically built men ever to grace the small screen .  He choreographed some of the best fight scenes ever filmed for television. I agree with one reviewer that the Kung-fu fighting style, utilized by Conrad in the first and second seasons, was more visually exciting than the boxing style used in subsequent seasons.  Black Belt Magazine published an article in the mid nineties that singled out this fighting style as one of the most realistic portrayals of martial arts ever shown on television.

Ross Martin once quipped on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, that while Conrad did his own stunts on WWW, he did his own acting. Martin was one of the finest character actors in televsion.  His Artemus Gordon was witty, a master of disguise, an inventor and the ultimate con artist.  Some reviewers have compared him to James Bond's ""Q"" That's very true in the aspect that he supplied West with his effective and life-saving gadgets, but Gordon was no mere comic foil.  He could always be counted on to arrive in the nick of time to save West's life after he had been captured by some meglomaniacal villian (Dr. Loveless, Count Manzeppi, etc). The partnership of Artemus Gordon and James West was built on camradarie, class and respect.  Unfortunately this did not get transferred in the awful big-screen update featuring Kevin Kline and Will Smith ( Man, that movie sucked.).

Finally, we are getting the gems of 60's television coming to dvd, and The Wild Wild West was one the diamonds of the lot.  Now if they could only get past the legal hurdles of releasing the Man From U.N.C.L.E.  ...",1146960000,8,2363,4.831265508684863
2531692,5,B000ERVJKO,"The series had a great time slot in the 60's, around 7:00PM on a Friday Night. Incredibly it was removed from TV not for bad ratings, in fact it was in the top ten for most of the years it was shown. It was removed for ""too much violence"". This would seem like a joke today! It was one of the most entertaining and best plotted shows of an era that began the inklings of the golden age of television detectives. This bordered on mystery and horror and featured an incredible time period setting of the 1870's in the old west. Agents West and Gordon are Secret Agents during the time of Ulysses S. Grant's administration in a time of reconstruction after the Civil War. The agents fight against fantastic situations by evil geniuses such as Dr. Loveless, a sinister, dwarfish yet ""please don't let him get caught"" personality that will have you captivated by his attempts to ""rule the world"" or at least become ""dictator of the West"". Every episode is pure entertainment. The music to the show is memorable and the opening sequence to the show has literally become famous in it's own right. Note that this changed over time, initially the agent only slightly pushes the lady away after her attempt to stab him in the back, in later years he punches her out! Also, Agent West in the beginning years could be beat up or captured by one or two thugs. In later years he takes on a whole bar of thugs (about 25) and they all get defeated! So the show has some interesting developments to say the least. Artemus Gordon is the master of make up and desguise. We get to see the relationship between the two agents grow and boy would I love to have Agent West's train to peruse the country! Anyway, this was one of the greatest 60's television shows ever! Not to be taken too seriously, as a lot of the gadgets used in the series are time inappropriate (they simply had not been invented yet) but boy is this fun! Get these shows, you won't regret it!",1146614400,7,1941,4.424581005586592

2531714,5,B000ERVJKO,"The classic Western/Sci-Fi series is finally on DVD.  If you've never seen it, check it out.  The sexism of the lead character is a little dated, but the plots and villains are amazingly creative.",1145059200,7,196,4.735294117647059
2531715,5,B000ERVJKO,"I am STOKED that this is finally coming to DVD. I hope that sales on the first season are adequate for the studio to release the other 3 seasons as well. I watched reruns for years either on San Diego local TV or on TNT later on. If I had a complaint it would be that the aired episodes were often either worn out copies with the music track sounding like a warped record, or episodes that had snipped scenes.

  Like many people have noted, Wild Wild West was like James Bond in the old west, with a twist: while James West is truly like an old west Bond, he had a deficiency that was made up for with a brilliant partner: Artemus Gordon. The missions West was on almost always needed a master of disguise to either infiltrate or confuse the enemy......or a bit of scientific know-how that would solve a problem that a traditional gunfight or fistfight would not solve. Although, fistfights on this show were plenty, often with great background music.  The repartee between West and Gordon is what helped to make this show fantastic and fun.

  It was said that Ross Martin, who played Artemus Gordon had a heart attack during the 1st season, I think he meant to say last. Indeed, Charles Aidman stepped in after the heart attack as Jeremy Pike for a few episodes. After that, some guest partners stepped in before Artie returned for the last few episodes. There were no truly horrible episodes during this period, but Artie was missed.

  Wild Wild West is truly an hour well-spent, though now it will be 45-50 minutes thanks to this release!",1144972800,11,1544,4.5215827338129495

Robert ""knock this battery off my shoulder..c'mon, I dare ya"" Conrad was a real hoot as the old west version of Bond, James Bond, and Ross Martin was perfectly cast as the 'master of disguise'.  To me, as a young teen when this show aired, it was a comic-book western come to life.  Even had elements of Sci-Fi and the supernatural that gave it true originality. Great villians, great fight scenes, damsels in distress...it had it all.

Also have to mention...loved that theme song!

I'll no doubt collect all 104 episodes!",1144800000,6,579,4.808080808080808
2531717,5,B000ERVJKO,"I was [...] when I used to watch Wild-Wild West in Iran in Persian Language. I was so mesmerized by the story, action and the style of both Jim West and Gordon. My room was covered by pictures and posters from this TV series. Jim West was my number one hero and I used to day-dream about each episode. In Iran, they used to show one episode each week on Friday night. As a kid, I used to take my time, sit down and write each episode in my notebook right after I watched it on TV so that I keep its memory alive. I still remember details of some of the stories. I will certainly buy every single DVD from Wild-Wild-West.",1144713600,10,620,4.090163934426229

2531720,4,B000ERVJKO,"As a child, one of my favorite series of all time was the Wild Wild West.  After a miserable day spent laboring in that gulag my parents referred to as school, it was a real treat to come home to watch this on weekdays.  It was incredibly creative, and ridiculously entertaining. Conrad and Martin were perfection in their roles. It's a shame it was cancelled for such a stupid reason. Most cool shows I loved as a child seem to have been cancelled before their time. Inncidentally, the film version sucked, except for Selma Hayak's [...].
  The first season of WWW, includes some of their finest episodes, most notably for me, ""The Night of the Steel Assassin, with guest star John Dehner, who oddly enough, was also a guest star in another, lesser first season ep as a completely different character, can't recall the exact title, Night of The White Buffalo, I think.
  One of the first season producers was Fred Frieberger, who, despite doing great work on the this series , went on to ruin some of my other favorite series, Star Trek, Space 1999, and the absymal first season of Superboy , which starred John ""You can't give me a speeding ticket 'cause I'm Superboy"" Haymes Newton.
  Another cool thing about the first season is Jim West's fighting style used martial arts, while in later season's he was content to just punch out opponents boxing style,which was fine when I was a kid, but kind of boring when I watch it now as an adult. Also, he beat up different guys every ep, as opposed to mainly the same group of stuntmen in the next three seasons, something even as a child I was painfully aware of. (a byproduct of eps being shown on a daily basis, I guess when the show originally aired, they must have thought viewers would forget from week to week) He beat up Red West in like every color episode!! The fighting looked much more realistic in season one. In subsequent seasons, the bad guys would practically stand in line waiting for their turn to have their asses handed to them by Jim West!! Don't get me wrong, I loved every season, actually I preferred the action and storylines for the color seasons, overall. First season, due to a rotating roster of producers, the series was finding it's way, settling into a distinct and highly sucessful formula by season two.  Considering that ""West was an incredibly popular show that was only cancelled because of it's violent content, the best episodes from season one to me had little violence in them , like Night of the Burning Diamond, another classic ep. And the one where Loveless played this crazy organ that controlled some sort of robotic henchmen,(good 'ole Richard Kiel) man that was spooky to me as a kid. You just don't see cool stuff like that on the cookie cutter crap shows of today, most of which I do not watch.
 I have like every ep of every season on super vhs and super beta, so these sets will have to have some extras to entice me to buy them. But who am I kidding, I will probably cave and buy them all, instead of blowing my money on frivolous stuff like food and shelter!!",1144368000,6,3061,4.528985507246377

2531722,5,B000ERVJKO,"More a spy show than western or science fiction, The Wild Wild West actually succeeds in being the closest thing to a James Bond TV series than any of the other secret agent programs, great as they are(despite THE MAN FROM UNCLE being an indirect idea of Ian Fleming's).  One may find it difficult to name a recurring or even one-shot arch-villian from UNCLE, I SPY, or MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, but Dr. Migelito Loveless and Count Manzeppi(two WEST episodes) can hold their own against Dr. No, Goldfinger, and Ernst Stavro Blofeld any day of the week.  In general, the British did do spy TV first and best, with the superb DANGERMAN and even production of Roger Moore's THE SAINT pre-dating 007's cinema success.  Yep, DANGERMAN premiered in 1960 and THE SAINT in '62, same year as Connery's Bond.  And who can argue that there is better entertainment than THE AVENGERS?  The Brits also eventually added such fantastic elements to their spy programs as super-normal powers in THE CHAMPIONS.  In addition, this type of show continued to be produced across the pond long after the US had cancelled all of it's secret agent-type series.  Witness THE PROTECTORS, THE PERSUADERS, and the NEW AVENGERS for some rollicking 70's spy stuff.  America did manage to create the masterpiece series MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE to hold up against it's foreign-produced competitors as a candidate for ""Best Spy Show of All Time"".  And the long-running GET SMART had a monopoloy on spoofing spys till AUSTIN POWERS came along an eternity later.  But what show do we love the most?  What show do we have the fondest memories of?  What show was cooked up from the finest action-packed ingredients gathered from the finest elements of classic grand high adventure?  The answer is THE WILD WILD WEST.  A derringer up the sleeve, explosives in a boot heel, a faithful friend behind the moustache, a tricked-out train, a midget bent on world domination, henchmen in monks' robes, the villian singing a duet with his lovely Antoinette, sinister circus's and carnivals, beautiful women who always come in pairs, a puppet-master with human marionettes, a regular and reliable homing pigeon communication system, a torpedo disguised as a dragon, an escape from Devil's Island, under-ground Victorian-style bad guy lairs extraordinaire, cliffhangers at every commercial break...  These are just a few of the things that make THE WILD WILD WEST an indescribable memory for countless guys and gals who watched re-run after syndicated re-run through-out the 60's, 70's and 80's.  This series deserves to become the most purchased TV show on DVD of all time.  Don't deprive yourself.  But beware, that old bearded geezer who rings up your DVD purchase is actually federal agent Artemus Gordon.  ""Arty, is that you?""  Wink...",1143504000,17,2780,5.0548245614035086
