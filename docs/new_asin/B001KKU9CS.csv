As the opening malicious mayhem ensues, I couldn't help but sense the frustration spewing from the conventional-minded gorehounds.
[Where's the plot and character development?]
<Didn't these people already die?>
{Why isn't this like the original Feast?}

Sorry dudes, this follows its own set of rules.  Well, #3 does open with some very cool intros & bios, plus it recaps the deaths from the previous escapade.  From there, you gotta pretty much expect the unexpected.

THE HAPPY FINISH is a raunchy, inane, whimsical, discombobulated, incoherent, fraudulant, impractical, frivolous, satirical, quagmatically rambunctiously morose and unequivocally revolting piece of cinematic spewage.  Not sure what all that means, but you get the idea.

Lots of similarities between this and SLOPPY SECONDS.  Not quite as memorable as the first two of the trilogy, but still some fun stupid stuff.
Like a woman giving the monster head, her head that is.  We get the splendid intestinal cinematography and closeup anal cam, as the human head is apparently quick to digest.
This has some cool new characters too, like my fave, Jean-Claude Segal.  There's lots of vicious melees and WTF moments.  Of course you'll need a dark, dry, and sick sense of humor.

3.5 stars.  Recommended mainly to fans of FEAST 2.",1235865600,,1398,5.328767123287672

THE HAPPY FINISH

I was absolutely happy with the fact hat a third film in this franchise was being released seeing that I loved the first two so much. I had no doubt what so ever that this one would be just as enjoyable to watch. The first one is a classic in my eyes and one of the best films of its kind since the Evil Dead films, and that is saying a lot [although those films can not be touched by anything]. The second one was a 5 star event as far as being enjoyable but the first remains the best, still the second as some of the craziest moments in film history [see the baby scene]. Any way I knew that the third film would be excellent as well and I was excited to finally get to see it the day it came out. Me, my girl and my brother all gathered round to view this next masterpiece in the series.

Picking up right were the last left off we are with our group of would be survivors trying to make it out of the town alive. Some from 2 are still left or should I say most but now we are joined threw out the film by new characters that only add to the bloody fun. So off we go on the next and possibly final chapter of this series in one of the most over the top and most enjoyable film experiences ever, no lie. These people fight them selves, the creatures, hybrids, and puked on zombieish folk along the way trying to save themselves.  After making off the roof they finally get into the Sherriff station and into the cell after beating down the bum that kept them out. The film moves along into the under ground aka the sewers, the film gets even crazier at this point.

Returning director John Gulager and writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan have done it once again and crafted another crazy bloody classic. They lean even closer to the comedic side more so then the last two with this one, and it is hilarious. I like that for old characters they get the cards like the first film but new ones get the live intro's like the second film, magnificent. And they did not answer many questions from the first two films, in fact they added more [those crazy guys].  I would love to see these three continue to work together more often on other types of films, and more of these of course. These guys seriously have some messed up minds, more on that later.

All the cast members that survived the last film return and of course Carl Anthony Payne II and Clu Gulager steal the show as one would expect. Still all of the cast are great and do wonderful jobs with each character, all were good. Still there were a lot of great new comers like Craig Henningsen who played and I kid you not Jean Claude Seagal, a crazy martial artist and man he is good. Still every one do great over the top performances and are due praise if I say so my self, and I do. And for all those who were disappointed that there were not to many kills in the last film will absolutely love this one here

This movie is full of blood and guts and wonderful nudity of the female kind and of course of the creature kind as well. Speaking of that there is a crazy rape scene in  this movie that takes out one of my favorite characters, a nasty mix breed comes from this. Of course the ending of this film is absolutely brilliant and you will never see it coming, I won't even begin to ruin it for you. My only hint is think of the flying car from part 2. Also there are some crazy puke people on this that are very much in need of blood, one even rubs a male body part on her self [what a great movie]. I really would love to go into detail about this movie but I don't want to give any thing away, you will absolutely love this trilogy.

Over all I would say that this is one of the best trilogies in history, or at least to me. I don't think I have had this much fun watching movies in a while, or at least since my Bruce Campbell marathon. By the way how great would it have been to have him in these flicks.",1235692800,2,3905,4.094117647058823
3666030,4,B001KKU9CS,"The ""Feast"" trilogy is unlike any other horror series on the market. This series is made to purposely entertain, disturb, and repulse the viewers. ""Feast 1"" is the best of the series and ""Feast 2"" is not too far behind. ""Feast 3"" is the weakest of the trilogy but manages to keep the overall characteristics of its predecessors. The only disappointment is the ending of the movie which makes no sense at all.....but then again, neither does any other part of the movie.

The plot is very simple. Monsters are trying to kill people and people are trying to survive. Exploding heads, sex-craved monsters, naked biker chicks, little people, and hearing impaired-prophets make this movie a hell of a ride. So Sit back; get a snack, and prepare for a wild experience.",1235692800,,762,4.7727272727272725
3666031,2,B001KKU9CS,"I have been a big fan of the Feast series since the original came out in theatres. Feast 2 was a decent direct to video movie but Feast 3 is clearly inferior to the first 2 movies. This movie was loaded with tons of gore for all the true horror fans but in my opinion there was just too much silliness throughout the movie. Yes Feast and Feast 2 had their share of comic moments but Feast 3 goes way beyond what the first two movies did with comedy. I am a big supporter of all of Dimension Extreme's horror movies, but the horrible sequels they have been releasing lately are causing me to consider renting them from now on and NOT purchasing them..",1235606400,,650,4.25

If you're just looking for a good time you should find it in this film.  I laughed my butt off and wish it would have just kept going... but it had to end.  I look forward to seeing the previous two film now since this really grabbed me.  If you're looking for something original or serious, look somewhere else.",1235001600,,489,4.271739130434782
3666033,3,B001KKU9CS,"As always the first was the best, the second not so bad and of course had to see the third.  i don't like giving anything away but in my opinion this this movie was as good as feast 2.  the same crude humor, unexpected moments, and the waht the hell just happened moments.  anybody who has seen the first two have to see this one.  really gory (which i love!), puker zombieish people, and monster sex.  my only complaint is the robot which was just so random to begin with.",1234828800,,473,4.211111111111111
3666034,2,B001KKU9CS,"Despite its shortcomings, I really dug the first Feast, based solely on its wicked sense of humor and the fact that you just didn't know what to expect next.  Feast 2: Sloppy Seconds was a step below the first film, but retained enough of the pitch-black humor and ultra-shocking moments to warrant it being a worthy sequel.  Feast 3: The Happy Finish does a bit of a recap of the last film before kicking things into high gear, and offers up some genuine surprises right off the bat.  Afterwards though, things go downhill, as we catch up with the rooftop survivors as they continue to wade through the horde of bloodthirsty creatures attacking them.  There is once again a heaping amount of blood and gore on display, but it isn't enough to save Feast 3, especially considering the headache-inducing strobelight scene and an ending that will have you swearing at the screen.  There's still a bit of the gallows humor and jaw-dropping moments to find in Feast 3, but not nearly enough to redeem it.  All in all, Feast 3: The Happy Finish is worth seeing for fans of the series, but in comparison to the first film, it can't hold a candle.",1234828800,3,1139,4.586206896551724
3666035,1,B001KKU9CS,"I loved Feast. It had the perfect balance of gore, shocks, and scares. It was all tied together with a rather wicked sense of humor. The movie is a genre flick but it also defied plenty of the defined rules. There were plenty of ""no they didn't moments.""
Feast II was a major let down to me. The balance was gone and in place of it was nothing but situation after situation played for shock value. Even that wicked humor was gone. Only a hint here and there remained. It was as if the people behind the trilogy believed that they reason for the first's success was all the shock value.
Well, those who witnessed the second atrocity recall the cliff hanger. It ended on a down note of despair. People were dying left and right.
Feast III: the Happy Finish picks up exactly where the second concluded. Actually, it does a bit of recapping and the last series of deaths get replayed. And as expected, the roof top sanctuary crumbles as a safe place and those remaining must flee to other hideouts. Along the way many die. Also new faces emerge. Among them, a karate kid named Jean-Claude Segal and a mentally challanged young man who seems t have the ability to control the beasts. How he does it should be no surprise to viewers but the rag tag bunch of survivors he aids prove to be quite daft.
The same trend from the second film is continued in this one. There is hardly any humor even when it tries so hard to be funny. The shocks come non-stop and the scares are minimal. There are plenty of gory moments but I stopped celebrating the gore of Feast with the second installation: this proved to be more of the same. I got an overwhelming sense of ""been there, done that"" as I sat through this wannabe-Feast sequel. (In truth... this one and number II are hardly worthy to be associated with the first... they both lack so much of the punch it had)
Throw in a conclusion that really doesn't fit anywhere with this twisted tale, a conclusion that is supposed to cap the trilogy, I might add... and I was left scratching my head and thinking ""what just happened?"" I still kind of don't know even though some mexican dressed like Elvis wielding a banjo sang it for me as the credits rolled. Seriously. I am not kidding.
Some of the kills were cool I suppose but after a while all the deaths felt the same. When someon e would say something empowering I sensed that they were soon to be a feast for the creepies and in most cases I was proven correct. Sigh.
I am hopeful that this ends here. But even if it doesn't, I'll just watch the first one and pretend like the other two never happened.",1234137600,10,2589,4.36231884057971
3666036,4,B001KKU9CS,"With the cliffhanger ending of Feast 2 Sloppy Seconds...it'll be great to see what happens next. Supposedly picking up on the roof right where Feast 2 ended...we'll finally see the final chapter of this trilogy.
Being that this is the same writing team that wrote both Saw 4 and Saw 5  this has, you won't believe how it ends written all over it.
They don't call it Dimension Extreme for nothing and the Feast movies do take things to all new extremes.

What makes these movies so great is how un movie like they really are, take some over the top characters and put them in an outrageous situation with these monsters and then Feast says..okay how would that REALLY happen? Would that great plan really work or would it work out like this.
Totally over the top, no holds barred old fashioned funny, gory, bloody monster movie. This is about as far away from mainstream film-making as you can get. I really hope they make a fourth Feast movie that follows the Tuffy, Bozo and Hot Wheels story. Like a Saw 4 version that runs parallel with this trilogy.

The other reviewer gavr britney spears - circus and a Pink album a 4 star rating??? that should tell you right there about his one star rating for feast 2 and 3.  One thing I've noticed about these Feast movies? the more times you watch them? the BETTER they get. The more times I saw Feast 2 the more I enjoyed it and started to really like the characters a lot like Thunder and Biker Queen and Tit and Tat Girl really come out of thier shells and have more dialogue in Feast 3.

How about the wresters and bikers? The rooftop opening will show you and beware, it is much worse (and darkly funnier) than hapless teenagers in ""Final Destination.""

""Feast 3: The Happy Finish"" follows the story of the survivors of ""Feast II"" and some new characters that show up in this deserted town. The film is certainly an improvement on the second installment, but not much. It still suffers from slack moments where almost nothing happens. Jokes are gross and outlandish (the ""Rambo 3"" joke, for instance), but that is a good thing here. There is a nice song at the end of the film, too. The problem is we need more of them. Much more.

Several new characters arrive, including ""The Prophet"" (Josh Blue) who, it seems, can control the monsters, and ""Jean Claude Segal"" (Craig Henningsen), a karate kid (check out his name). They are interesting initially, but it turns out they have little to do in the thin story. The sewer part is painfully slow, and ... why the sewer in the first place?

3666078,3,B001KKU9CS,"Four years ago, when the first FEAST came out, I was pleasantly surprised, but a bit too disgusted to tell many people about it.  When I discovered that two sequels were filmed last year, I sat down with all three films and watched them front to back.  Here's a brief recap:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Feast/dp/B000GLL1U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Feast</a>
The basic scenario: a scattering of rastabouts are trapped in a bar by a family of malevolent creatures with large underbites.  The characters try, mostly unsuccessfully, to find a way out without getting killed.  Meaning virtually everyone gets killed.

Because the movie is staunchly amoral, the gore is obscene.  Everyone from the jaw-chiseled hero to the helpless toddler is up for grabs, and in ways that are designed to make you squeam.  The movie helps viewers out by offering up stat cards the first time a character is introduced, including the probability that the character will be dead by the closing credits.  It's a bit of smart playfulness that makes the proceeding hideousness a little bit easier to handle.

Personal state: bemused, slightly nauseous, took two antacids, probably the pizza.  Four stars.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Feast-II-Sloppy-Seconds/dp/B001CDFY64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Feast II: Sloppy Seconds</a>
I'm not ruining anything for you by saying that one of the characters to die in the first film was a sneery biker chick referred to as Harley Mama.  In fact, she suffered an especially gruesome death (which is saying a lot), and now her twin sister has discovered her remains and is off an ill-advised revenge quest.  She is accompanied by an unlikely survivor from the first film, and together they encounter many spectacularly horrifying things including:
--a baby ... that's all I'm saying about it.  A baby is involved.
--every single bodily fluid you can name, one after the other
--the violation of a cat
--a liquefied grandmother
--and so on

This installment introduces a new character archetype called ""The Puker.""  See, if the creatures vomit on you, you either melt away after time, or the melting stops and you develop an irrational affinity for blood.  But not for the blood of other Pukers.  It's not THAT irrational.

The creatures are more clearly seen this time around.  They run around giddily, mating and eating; they appear to be what humanity would evolve into if all money and electricity disappeared from the face of the earth.  Meanwhile, our cast of characters commits all kinds of grotesque acts, all in supposed self-interest.  [...]  Or, more accurately, that most people think it's funny.  But I found it distracting.

In their attempt to top the first film, the makers turned the second movie into a pornographic satire of the original flick.  A catapult is created using the clothes of two breasty biker chicks who spend the remainder of the movie mostly nude.  A man ends up with a pipe in his head but suffers only minor swelling.  Except for the Mexican wrestlers, Thunder and Lightning, every character was viciously selfish.  The movie pushed the envelope until I had no more pushing room left.

And yes.  What did it for me was the baby.  I guess that was supposed to be funny.

Personal state: experiencing abdominal distension, some light sobbing, phone call to mother.  Two stars.

FEAST III: THE HAPPY FINISH
This is another immediate continuation from the previous film, with our gang moving underground in their quest to safety, guided this time by a mentally handicapped Prophet who has an unusual ability to ward off the creatures.  As it crawls through labyrinthine sewage systems, the movie achieves new depths to its depravity, including violence of cartoonish dimensions.  (Seriously.  Wile E. Coyote would fit right in here.)  At first I'd rationalized that the movie was offering a kind of social commentary.  In fact, as the third movie unspooled, I was reminded by what Dawson said, ""As soon as men decide that all means are permitted to fight an evil, then their good becomes indistinguishable from the evil that they set out to destroy.""  It made the movie seem smart again.

The ending, not so much.  It's abrupt, it's stupid, it's completely out of left field, like the filmmakers just said, ""I'm tired of this movie.  Let's stop.""  There's a tease about a possible fourth (and an amusing song over the final credits), but the whole thing felt like a shamefaced shrug to me.  As if the makers didn't want people to be too offended, so they finished with a silly little ""See?  We didn't mean no harm!""  When, of course, they did.

The first 10 minutes of the film had me rolling on the floor in laughter. It is a good mixture of horror, gore and comedy. Be warned, this film is not for non-horror fans. The horny, hungry monsters introduced in the first two films are particularly nasty here. There are a few scenes, in the beginning, that are really over-the-top.

The only secret that is revealed is the film-makers for all three movies is to make the goriest movies they could. And each movie upped the ante in gore and part three is the goriest.  The film starts where part two ended-on the rooftop and the rest of the movie follows their attempts to evade the very hungry creatures.  Along the way they get picked off, each death gorier than the last one.  One of the men is impregnated by a creature and two seconds later his belly swells and he gives birth to another creature.
To add to the bloodbath they run into a bunch of mutant cannibals while they are trying to escape through a sewer?  They are joined by a karate kicking young man named Jean-Claude Segal.  Get it?  A combination of the names of Jean-Claude Van Damme and Steven Segal.  But he proves to be useless as a few minutes later he loses both of his arms and when surrounded by the creatures he tries to karate kick his way out of danger but then loses the rest of his body.  One of the girls comes face to face with a creature, by now she is just fed up, so she bites and takes a chunk out of the thing, so the rest join her and give the thing a taste of it own medicine(appetite).

The movie just goes on and on in this fashion-more splat per minute than the first two feasts-but the ending comes out of left field.  There are 3 survivors and two of them get squished by a........I'm not going to tell but it makes as much sense as the rest of the movie.

While the credits are rolling a Mexican with a guitar sings a song about all three movies and ends the song more or less saying-what are these movies all about?  How the eff do I know?  My sentiments exactly-how the eff do I know?  What I do know is-the movie is a splatterfest.  So if you like blood-drenched carnage, bodies ripped to shreds, entrails, a lot of gore, more blood, mutant cannibals, a midget wrestler, a man with a pipe through his chin and out his head, more blood, a topless babe, a pregnant man, more gore, this movie provides a Feast for the gorehound and in that respect it is successful.",1237075200,,2314,4.319444444444445
3666084,1,B001KKU9CS,"What was John Gulager thinking when he directed this mess? I know he's already given an interview where he basically tells people if they don't like it -tough! And there's talk of a 4th film coming out. Don't get me wrong ""Feast"" was a great movie. Something new and held your attention throughout. ""Feast II"" started out good but started going downhill rapidly. ""Feast III"" was just a train wreck coming out of the station. It was like they made it up as they went along. When I saw Gulager's first film, I thought he was going to be a director to contend with. Somewhere along the way, he fell asleep at the wheel. Don't waste your time. Even if you were a fan of ""Feast"" you won't like this film. And Wow! The ending stunk bad! Can I get my money back on this? Well, John, I know you don't care what I think, but this is just another lousy movie that went straight to DVD to make money off the title. If this had been at a theatre I would have asked for my admission back. Dimension is starting to put some really bad movies out under their 'Dimension Extreme' label.",1236816000,,1070,4.275862068965517
3666085,5,B001KKU9CS,"The Feast franchise is like antibiotics.  One is not enough, it's incomplete.  Kind of like the Godfather series.  Once the first is begun, like antibiotics, the whole regimen must be taken, and while doing so there may be agony and moaning (like Godfather III).

After reuniting with the cast of characters from the cliff hanger Feast II - the midgets, the awesomely topless biker chicks, Whisper & Slasher, Honey Pie & The Bartender, we soon get a few superb additions to the movie; one named S*#tkicker and another named Jean Claude Seagal.  Yes, Jean Claude Seagal.  If there is a cooler name, and a more hilariously overt parody of already lampooned characters (SNL and Mad TV skits don't count), then I have never seen one.  Together they add just enough suave machismo and unpredictable catastrophes (""It's just a flesh wound"") to keep the movie rolling along.

The most important aspect of all three Feast movies is the potpourri of gore, wisecracks, blood, and extremely heavy-handed WTF scenes.  Whereas the classic money shot of Feast II was the baby volleyball scene, this installment challenges and treats the viewer with two classic scenes.  An alien colonoscopy that vividly displays a fecal matter covered human head via the first ever corn-hole cam gushes out of the alien excretory system, bouncing on the ground like a half deflated basketball.  The other scene can best be described as a cross-species, homosexual, inter-racial, box-car, prison anal rape...and I'll leave it at that.

An attempt at the rest: the biker chicks are the BAMFs, a prophet with cerebral palsy, a bizarre alien/zombie lair with strobe lights and a sweet techno soundtrack, trendy camera usage (night vision and shaky camera), front kick decapitations, and a classic mariachi ending during the credits that attempts to summarize the ridiculous awesomeness of this trilogy.",1236729600,10,1868,5.128712871287129
3666086,1,B001KKU9CS,"I've yet to write about the second film in the FEAST trilogy. That's because I knew the third was coming out and hoped that it would give me reason to appreciate the second more. Instead, it proved what I feared already, that the film series was as bad as the second made it out to be.

I was a big fan of the first film, I still am. It was the result of the TV series PROJECT GREENLIGHT where contestants were allowed to become part of the film making process and hopefully go on to bigger and better things. Such is not the case here and perhaps that's why the series disappeared.

One of the big problems in the initial series was the director chosen, John Gulager. During the series one felt sorry for him and it seemed as though the people behind the scenes were picking on him. His biggest fault was in searching for a comfort zone that always included hiring both friends and family to be in the film while ignoring anyone else. This resulted in his dad (actor Clu Gulager) and his girlfriend being in the first film. With the second and third films and seemingly no one to rein him in, he brings them both back (even though his girlfriend's character was killed) as well as his brother and nephew.

The second film began with the survivors of the first making their way to town from the bar out in the middle of nowhere. They got together with others in town while the monsters rampaged throughout, tearing up people and property along the way. Gulager's gal returned this time as the leader of a female biker gang and twin sister of the role she played in the first film.

Along the way we picked up a used car salesman, his boss, the boss's wife he's had an affair with, a midget who seems destined for porn star fame, his brother (the pair are acrobats) and a few others. The creatures are suddenly not just ravenous monsters but monsters with testicles that swing and sway as they run down the street.

At the end of the 2nd film, those that survived to this point are stranded on the roof of a building while wanting to be in another. Part 3 picks up there. And it gets more ridiculous than the 2nd part. One character ends up with a pipe shot through his head from chin to top and survives almost the rest of the picture in pain but moving.

The team eventually does get off the rooftop but still has to hide from the creatures. Not only are these creatures hungry, they're horny as well which results in the used car owner being raped through a tiny hole in the back of a semi-trailer, thrust back and forth until he is impregnated and almost immediately gives birth to a junior creature.

A savior appears in the form of a robed figure who chases the creatures away. Dressed in a robe and carrying a staff, he appears Gandlaf-like at the best of times. At first mysterious, it turns out he's a handicapped young man with delusions of grandeur and a hearing aid the creatures can't stand.

More people are eviscerated, more blood and boobs are shown and by the films end you are so tired of seeing nearly the same thing over and over that the final credits are more a relief than anything you've been exposed to so far.

The film gives us this to believe. If you are a hero or good looking guy, you're definitely toast or soon to be severely injured. If you are a hot looking woman, your top is gonna come off eventually. If you are a sacred image like a baby, your food for monsters. And if you like horror films stick with the first one and avoid the last two.

Words has it that they're in talks to make a part four. Instead I think it would be better if we all just chipped in to help Gulager see a good therapist. The images chosen for these last two parts seem more like something he should work out there than expose the rest of us to.",1236124800,3,3757,4.301272984441301

8315151,5,B001KKU9CS,"Feast III: The Happy Finish is one of my top favorite movies, including the previous two chapters from one of my top favorite directors, John Gulager. Written by Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton and featuring The Great Legendary Clu Gulager, Diane Ayala Goldner, Tom Gulager and many more. A film series that has everything an extreme fan will faithfully love. It even makes huge Hollywood monster/survival films into a PG show for kids. That's how freakin' extreme it is and everything is hardcore to the max with awesome, crazy characters battling against hungry and horny creatures with lots of blood, gore, action, comedy, and so much more, in an extremely disturbing and funny way. My favorite character is Biker Queen played by Diane Goldner, who is one of the toughest, meanest, and baddest women characters I've seen. She ain't no Alice from the Resident Evil films and for damn sure she ain't any PG13 action character from The Expendables films or any other overrated action films, she is just that great when it comes to being bad and tough!!! I have said this before and I will say it again, this is an extreme film series that I'll never and I mean never ever, get bored of!!!",1517961600,,1190,4.753623188405797
