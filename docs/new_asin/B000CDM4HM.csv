8097947,4,B000CDM4HM,"If you are interested in getting a glimpse into the world of cross-cultural relationships, infidelity, and one lonely man's search for happiness, then Russian Doll is a pleasant way to spend an evening.

Hugo Weaving stars as Harvey, a bumbling bachelor nearing middle-age.  The movies plot centers around how he and Katya, a Russian mail order bride find a way beyond their loneliness and happiness together.

Unlike your typical mail order bride movie, Harvey doesn't order Katya.  Evan, Harvey's best friend needs a place to ""stash"" his mistress, and enlists Harvey to marry her as a front.

I won't spoil the movie, but I actually enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

Weaving once again shows his versatility as he is able very believable in this role, a far departure from Mr. Smith, in the Matrix movies.

Recommended!
