4134048,5,B003KSO3PM,Dora is one of my grand daughter's favorite characters.  But this video is her most favorite.  Very bright and entertaining with educational input too.  She liked it so much that her Mother bought one also.  Very good video.,1284681600,,224,4.815789473684211
4134049,4,B003KSO3PM,"A new Dora DVD titled Dora's Big Birthday Adventure (released August 03, 2010) contains the 10th anniversary birthday episode aired on TV along with two other episodes. All three episodes feature the Wizzles and Wizzle World and form the Magic Storybook Trilogy.

""Dora's Big Birthday Adventure"" - Dora is preparing to celebrate her birthday with her friends and family but a twisting wind blows Dora and Boots into the Magic Storybook and the Wizzle World. Dora ends up with a wishing crystal and must take it to the Wishing Wizzle before she can return home. Hmm, sounds a little familiar...what follows is a plot relatively similar to The Wizard of Oz. There's a mean witch (La Bruja) with flying monkey helpers, a nice Snow Princess, a star studded road, and even a scarecrow. To find to the Wishing Wizzle Dora must first find her way through Sea Snake Lake, The Dancing Forest and go over the RAINBOW. Along the way she looks into the wishing crystal and her memories of her family and friends (shown as hazy flash backs to previous episodes) help propel her over the obstacles. My children especially enjoyed the birthday celebration at the end of the show.

""Dora Helps the Birthday Wizzle"" - In this episode about birthday wishes, the Birthday Wizzle is celebrating his own birthday. As he prepares to make his own birthday wish come true, a strong wind blows his wishing wand out of the storybook. Dora catches and works to return the wand to the Birthday Wizzle before the candles on his cake burn out. She goes through the Unicorn Forest and Dinosaur Caves and ends up on Wizzle Mountain. There's a Birthday Express train in this episode that appealed to my toddler son.

""Wizzle Wishes"" - A little Wizzle happily holds a bag of four wishing stars, but a strong wind blows the wishes right out of his bag and the storybook. He follows them out of the book, and Dora helps him try to capture the wishing stars so that he can wish his way back home. They follow the path through a flowery garden and nutty forest all the way to the wishing well.

The new birthday episode is enjoyable to watch because it includes all the characters from previous Dora episodes. My daughter was happy to see the Piggies. The DVD cover we received includes a big pop up flap and a sticker sheet so that kids can actively join in the birthday fun. My kids also enjoyed counting the ten candles on the cake displayed on the cover. (Review copy received from Nickelodeon)",1284508800,5,2460,4.635321100917431
4134050,5,B003KSO3PM,My kids loved this. Dora and Boots have to remember FOUR things this time. And too funny for parents. Watch for the parallels to the Wizard of OZ. My kids even had fun watching for them. I won't tell you and spoil all the fun...,1283904000,3,228,4.088888888888889
4134051,5,B003KSO3PM,"I purchased this video for my 28 month old grand daughter.  Wow, she sat and watched the
entire video.  Now she even answers Dora back when she asks a question.  This was her
first introduction to Dora and it was a WINNER.",1283644800,,222,4.238095238095238
4134052,4,B003KSO3PM,"The only real criticism I could see, except mabey that my three year old will no longer watch anything else was the cheap parody of Wizard of OZ that never really feels completed. Plus ""wizzles"", you would think that after 10 years of cartoons you could come up with something more complete. But this is a kids movie.",1283472000,,317,4.482758620689655
4134053,5,B003KSO3PM,"My two kids loved this latest Dora adventure! Dora and Boots find themselves trapped in Dora's magic storybook, and have to work their way through the book to find the Wishing Wizzle and wish themselves to the real world in time for Dora's birthday party. Every time Dora and Boots get into trouble, they flash back to scenes from Dora episodes of the past that help them figure out how to solve their problems. This double-length episode was really cute, and my kids greatly enjoyed the re-appearance of characters and locations from long time favorite Dora adventures. Really well done!

The DVD also includes two older, Wizzle-themed bonus episodes, ""Dora Helps the Birthday Wizzle"" and ""Wizzle Wishes,"" giving this DVD a total running time of about an hour and twenty minutes. Great Dora fun and highly recommended!",1281139200,9,819,4.978102189781022

8398921,5,B003KSO3PM,"Of course I bought this for my granddaughter, a Dora fanatic!  She adores Dora.  I will say, that squeaky voice of hers can become somewhat annoying after a while, so I do try to keep the volume down.  But the lessons and educational backing of this series of toddler videos is very well presented, researched, easy to follow, and it incorporates the ability for a child to learn Spanish as well.  As a retired teacher I am more critical than most about what my grandchildren watch for entertainment purposes, and to finally find a character that pushes all the proper values I want my grandchildren to instill is truly a joy.  I'm sure many have frowned at the whole 'Spanish' interpretation, but to me I see no reason why it is such a big deal when a child can learn an additional language.  America is so behind academically as it is, so to incorporate other beneficial options for those children that choose to learn more--why not?  I'm all for it.  Additionally, my grandchildren will watch Dora 'repeats' endlessly without complaint.  If I'm going to use a technological babysitter involving entertainment, I choose Dora!",1441238400,,1127,4.7979274611398965

8398926,5,B003KSO3PM,My daughter is almost 2 years old and she LOVES Dora! This is by far her favorite DVD. she even asks for it by name (she calls it dvd cakes because of the cake on the front). We used to have to rent this dvd from our library weekly but I am going to just buy it for her birthday now. She hums along with the songs and even answers Dora. It can be a very repetative dvd but I like that at least she is learning somethings and its so cute to hear her responding to the questions,1406160000,,476,3.8181818181818183
