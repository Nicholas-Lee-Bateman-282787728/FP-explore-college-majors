8429411,1,B004H9ZQ7C,Stay away from this pile of crap!!!  The medium in this is as bogus as they come!!!  The team runs around like a bunch of idiots!!  There just is nothing here but people's imaginations and poor producing and film making.  Another nail in the coffin for the parapsychology field.  Never waste your time unless you are watching with a true parapsychologist.  WHY????  Because they are trained in everything and all of these second rate ghost hunters are not.  It shows in this film!!!!!,1436313600,,484,4.746987951807229
8429412,2,B004H9ZQ7C,"I watched a doc. about Fox Hollow Farm by Dan T. Hall and had to have this. Unfortunately, this never pulled me in the way Fox Hollow Farm did. This was a ""might as well while I'm here"" project. This doc. seems pretty generic and does not have that one main focal point that would make the viewer gouge someone's eyes out if interrupted. Still a big Dan T. Hall fan.",1394150400,,366,4.169014084507042
8429413,4,B004H9ZQ7C,as described works well on time in good condition no problems with product use as intended 18 words is too much to require,1373846400,,122,4.3478260869565215

8429415,3,B004H9ZQ7C,"Excellent program talking about the history of Central State,...my only reason for giving it ""three stars"" was it wasn't not long enough of a documentary,...should have been a two hour program instead of only forty five minutes. Yes,there were some scary parts,but was still a good program.
Should have went deeper into the history and what went on inside the hospital. Other than that,it was interesting to watch.",1367712000,2,414,5.102941176470588
8429416,5,B004H9ZQ7C,Interesting investigation on one of the most haunted places. Good video and really creepy EVP;s. The DVD director's cut has extended footage of the interviews and the investigations. ghostville.us,1361491200,4,196,5.793103448275862
8429417,5,B004H9ZQ7C,On the grounds of an abandoned mental institution the investigators founds some really interesting paranormal activity. This program uses archival footage and patient interviews along with the paranormal investigators to tell the story.,1360627200,,236,6.181818181818182
8429418,1,B004H9ZQ7C,"Luckily, we rented this from our Library so it didn't cost us anything but the wasted time in watching.  This thing is truly scary!  It is actually shocking how lame it is.  My wife couldn't take it after just 10 minutes and stopped watching.  My 11 year old and I sort of zipped through the rest of it.  The film has only ONE moment that is even worth watching as they do catch an unusual ""orb"" that is not a typical example that lasts for about 3 seconds.  EVERYTHING else is complete rubbish.  From the start we see that the motivation for this documentary is an eerie feeling and a curtain that is wrapped so that it vaguely resembles a screaming head from a distance during the shooting of a scene for another movie.  They then show later the curtain is now untied and looks normal with no explanations or guarantees that no one was upstairs.  Should have known just how flimsy the documentary would be from that I guess!  SERIOUSLY, this film is crud on ice!  During review of some evidence they also pronounce something ""unexplainable"" instead of the MUCH more accurate unexplained.",1317686400,4,1089,4.561855670103093
