6042283,2,B00FZURN3C,"While transporting an iceberg to Alexandria, Egypt another Mega-Shark becomes thawed, alive and dangerous. The recently thawed creature is able to sling the tug boat through the air and knock off the head of the Sphinx 112+ miles away. They managed to create a Mecha-Shark to combat the creature because Mark 48 torpedoes always miss the mark and come back to sink the launching ship. Pony tailed Rosie (Elisabeth Rhm) is the pilot of the battery operated mechanical shark even though it has a computer that can do it. They create a second mechanical shark just because. After they tag the Mega-Shark with a GPS device, they still need Debbie Gibson to tell them where the shark is headed, because she adds a name to the DVD cover. Eat your heart out Danny Trejo.  Rosie has an awkward  flashback to a child that died, which really didn't work well in the film.

Asylum continues its Navy insignia guessing game. In this film the admiral wore two ""surface warfare specialist"" breast pins on his lapels (no rank insignia) while a captain wears the breast pin on his shirt pocket (close but no cigar).

The ending of the film was a big ""huh?"" Mild cheese factor. Bad dialog, and they had a great opportunity with a talking computer. The admiral knew someone who died on every boat, and made sure we knew too. Not the best Asylum Mega film out there. If you haven't seen the other ones, I would expect them to all be out soon on one DVD for $5.00.

6042284,2,B00FZURN3C,"This film was a bit of a disappointment after ""Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus"" and especially ""Mega Shark vs Crocosaurus"". It had some fun scenes but overall it felt slow paced and not nearly as fun as the previous ones. It's watchable but not as fun as I had hoped and expected.",1392336000,,276,4.326923076923077
6042285,3,B00FZURN3C,"Ahhh another Mega Shark movie but this time around he goes up against Mecha Shark. I take it that this is Asylum's take on Godzilla vs Mega Godzilla. Anyway, the story lacks the fights I was kind of hopping to see between the two monsters but it was a decent fight. The story is also kind of sluggish but I will have to say that the CGI has definitely improved as the usual production for Asylums films are filmed within 2 weeks tops. I do have to hand it to them that they were will able to keep my attention on this one. Call me weird but yeah, I do like cheesy B rated flicks and it's all in good fun. This isn't one of the better Mega Shark films but Asylum Films is keeping the junk food Mock Busters alive. Would I recommend this movie to anybody? Honestly no but but if you're into junk food movies like I am, then this is the one for you.",1391990400,2,846,4.041666666666667
6042286,1,B00FZURN3C,"Perhaps the worst movie of its kind that I've seen, Mega Shark Vs Mecha Shark isn't near as entertaining as my most recent bowel movement. Wooden acting, no humor whatsoever, and not enough action make this movie a must avoid.",1391904000,,226,4.675
6042287,4,B00FZURN3C,"When a new Mega Shark threatens mankind, the government unleashes the top-secret Mecha Shark to defeat the monster in a pitched battled that threatens the planet.

The first two Mega Shark films were, actually, pretty good films to me. They hit that perfect line as far as B-movies are concerned, despite the fact that both didn't really give you time to invest in the characters. Still, I enjoyed them and hoped The Asylum would put out another sequel. Well, thankfully- I got my wish and we've been blessed with Mega Shark Vs Mecha Shark. So,  how do I feel about the second sequel? I like it. I'll admit, though, I wasn't as crazy about this one as I was about the last two. Why? Well, again..by the time, the film gets started good- it's over. You don't really get the time to know the cast in it. To me, that's kind of annoying..especially when the script is good as well as the acting and direction of the thing. It's a pleasure, mind you, to see Debbie Gibson as well as Elisabeth Rohm & Christopher Judge acting but I was disappointed we didn't get more. Not only that but, if you're going to call the film Mega Shark Vs Mecha Shark, give us some hardcore confrontation between these two..not the uninspired little bit that we do see. Maybe The Asylum is planning to give us that in a Mega Shark Vs Mecha Shark 2, who knows?  While it's not Sharknado, Mega Shark Vs Mecha Shark  is still a good film. I did like it. I do recommend you give it a look.

If you like Shark films, you'll like this one. I guarantee it!",1391385600,3,1522,4.363957597173145

6042292,3,B00FZURN3C,"Theres only one thing in the world more dangerous than a megalodon on a rampage of destruction  and thats a woman pilot pursuing that megalodon in a gigantic mechanical shark loaded to bear with torpedoes.  Seriously, this woman wipes out almost as many lives as the prehistoric monster shark.  Fortunately, Mecha Shark is smart enough to operate on his own, without a bad human pilot, but will his oh-so-powerful computer system with the voice of Knight Rider be able to outsmart the king of the very kings of predators?

So, let me get this straight.  The UN has secretly commissioned the construction of a high tech mechanical mega shark (not to mention a much smaller prototype) just in case another megalodon turns up someday?  Sure, its happened twice already (see Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus and Mega Shark vs Crocosaurus), but the odds of it happening again have to be extremely remote.  Of course, it does come in handy when megalodon number three does turn up at the port of Alexandria, Egypt  as long as its not being controlled by Dr. Rosie Gray (Elisabeth Rohm), anyway.  It makes for a classic The Asylum opening, as our sharp-toothed hero redesigns the Giza plateau with one simple flip.  Its really not his fault, though.  There he was, encased for millennia in a mound of ice, not hurting anyone, when some boat comes along, tears away his personal ice shelf, and totes it down to a drought-stricken Egypt.  When you're suddenly awakened from that kind of epic sleep session, you're going to be cranky.  Youre going to be hungry, too  and then you're going to want to look for a mate.  Its sort of unfortunate that our megalodon decides to head toward Australia rather than Japan, though  as much as I love Japan, I wouldnt mind seeing a few of those Japanese whalers taught a hard lesson on natural selection.

Mega Shark vs. Mecha Shark has just about everything you would expect from a classic Asylum monster epic  ridiculous science; lots of explosions and underwater action; attacks by sea, by land, and by air; and heroic characters pulling off one ridiculous stunt after another.  As a bonus, the film does not inflict any kind of love triangle or love reconciliation subplot on the audience for once (the heroes are already happily married).  Unfortunately, though, it gives Debbie Gibson (who, as we all know by now, is the worlds leading expert on mega sharks) scant screen time with just a few cameo scenes.  Am I wrong to expect at least one hot babe getting significant screen time in a film of this type?  Wrong or not, theres very little eye candy to be found here.  Overall, I have to say that this is still a pretty good movie  but it just never manages to get past third gear.  It definitely falls short of the previous Mega Shark movies.",1438128000,,2773,4.679752066115703

6042304,1,B00FZURN3C,"Considering The Asylum has a very low bar for reason and practicality, there is no reason this movie has to be as profoundly boring as it is.

Typically, I enjoy watching Asylum films - almost as a guilty pleasure. But when I do, I know what I've signing up for: Ridiculous premise, poor acting (over or under), gargantuan plot holes, modestly low production values, and shoddy but well-intentioned effects. It is a combination of these factors that often give these intentionally low-horizon B-films their particular charm.

And even as ridiculous as the premise may be in such films, one of the factors that helps the viewer enjoy the experience is through characters developed as though they are experiencing the scripted content,....acting as though they are actually involved in and reacting to the events portrayed. ""Mega Shark vs. Mecha Shark"" does not have this. But that didn't stop The Asylum from turning a fairly compelling premise and enough creativity for a 5 minute movie and turned it into 85 minutes of possibly the most boring film in their entire lineup. It feels like standing in line all day for the Haunted House attraction at the county fair, only to have an old burned out stoner waving a black light and poking you in the face with a feather duster. I feel like I got Rick-Rolled for an hour and half.

I don't want to give too many spoilers, but I do have to address a couple of things:

1.) A MegaShark shows up fixin' to cause mayhem. This is the 3rd film in the franchise, so everyone knows MegaShark is dangerous. This is made evident when MegaShark attacks 4 times. (tugboat, fishing trawler, oil rig, and battleship.) I'm telling you about those because there is almost no buildup, and the action sequences are so short that if you blink you will miss them.

2.) The military comes up with a plan to combat the MegaShark. So they create a giant sheetmetal robot shark - a submarine that looks like a shark - for reasons that thus far elude me. Only 1 person is trained to pilot the MechaShark, and when she feels battle ready, they put her into a newer, even bigger MechaShark that hasn't yet been tested, and she hasn't been trained to pilot - again for reasons that thus far elude me. Naturally everything goes wrong as MechaShark is a complete failure, destroying everyone and everything EXCEPT the intended target. But do they feel bad about it? No, not really, because that would involve acting. Evidently that is not what the actors have been hired to do.

3.) MegaShark and MechaShark do some sparring - because that's pretty much the title and premise of the whole movie. But I did the math. Out of 85 minutes of film, the MegaShark and MechaShark are shown interacting for a total of 93 seconds.

93 SECONDS!!!!!!

In other words, ""MegaShark vs. MechaShark"" only features 1.8% actual versing. ONE. POINT. EIGHT. PERCENT.

People feel cheated when they find out Hawaiian Punch only contains 5% real fruit juice.  So imagine the outright deceit involved in 1.8% versing in ""MegaShark vs. MechaShark"".

Granted, it's not ALL atrocious. When MechaShark goes into (*spoilers*) amphibious mode we're treated to some of the most entertaining visual effects moments in The Asylum history. But they are just that....moments. And all things considered, those moments just aren't worth the 64 minutes of thumb-sucking dullness it takes to reach them.",1411516800,6,3380,4.820379965457685
6042305,3,B00FZURN3C,"MEGA SHARK VS MECHA SHARK

the third film in the series and thus far the final sees the Mega Shark go one on one with the Mecha version of its self. The Mega Shark has become a popular franchise for The Asylum so it was only a matter of time before these films went Mecha, all the classics do right? This time around Christopher Judge is in the house to take on the Mega along side the returning Debbie Gibson.

With the threat that the Mega Shark could some day return the government has created two Mecha Sharks. One is bigger than the other and is still being worked on when the Mega Shark returns. So with a rampage coming they have no choice to put their creations to the test. There are only two people that can helm these things and save the world. But can they do it even with the help of someone who has faced this terror before.

This one is just as crazy and fun as the other two and just as outrageous. It kinda takes me back to the good old days of giant monsters versus the mecha versions of themselves. Obviously Godzilla is the first that comes to mind but those were better films. I think I enjoyed the suits and stuff more than the CGI of The Asylum. Still it is an enjoyable film with some bad acting and all.

Christopher Judge is my boy and he may have just wanted to have fun with it but he has done better. There were moments from other people though that were just horrible which is fun. The writers and director have done other films for the Asylum including other shark films. Speaking of which there is a great commentary on this film featuring them and Judge. You can tell these guys had a great time making this flick. There is also a good behind the scenes feature and trailers for other Asylum films. Over all this was just as good or bad as the previous two films so if you liked them then you will like this one.",1409184000,3,1845,4.188732394366197

6042309,1,B00FZURN3C,"This is a painfully bad movie, made worse by several inconvenient moments of intrusion featuring Debbie Gibson.  The only reason I stayed until the bitter end was because it kept bugging me that I couldn't remember where I last saw Elisabeth Rohm, she had to be an actress of note, what show was she on, what movie had I seen her in???  Couldn't remember for the life of me, so I sat there dumbfounded on two counts, who is she and why am I watching this really crappy movie!?!?!?!
The plot wasn't special, just your average bad shark on the rampage scenario.  Apropos of nothing, the military just happened to have a shark shaped submarine on hand.  Why?  Why not?  Makes more sense than an elephant shaped submarine.  They figured it would be their best defense against a really big shark so they shoved this woman into it, the aforementioned wonder woman Rohm, and made her tail the killer shark.  Oh, and the shark shaped sub also has its own personality, a back-talking A.I. named Nero.  Loads of unconvincing CGI, plus the guy who used to be on Stargate (Christopher Judge).  Not a stellar moment for anyone.  And it seemed to last for days (longest 90 minute movie ever)!  Beyond dull, this movie is monumentally mind numbingly monotonous.  And nary a laugh to be had (I could have forgiven it anything had it produced a few unintentional chuckles).  Nope, it's just plain awful.  What a grueling experience watching this movie to the bitter end.  Taxing.  Harsh.  Wore my poor brain to a frazzle.
