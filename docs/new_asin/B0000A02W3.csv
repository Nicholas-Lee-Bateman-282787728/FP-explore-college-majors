7994891,5,B0000A02W3,"I picked this dvd up over the summer, wanting to find
something different for my daughter, who has watched
all the more popular and well-known stuff for her age group.
She was slow to like this actually, and would opt for Blue's
Clues et al (also great product) when looking for something
to watch. But when she grew tired of all the usual fare I
could see she started to give this a chance - and now she
loves it.

The dvd has about 16 shorts, each around 5 minute slong, which
is great because it doesn't force a complicated story and keeps
pace with a young person's attention span.  Furthermore, each
story offers a nice life-lesson. In brief, if you and the kids
are looking for something new and of quality, check out this dvd!",1233532800,,733,4.382352941176471
7994892,4,B0000A02W3,"I was not familiar with the series but I bought this particular DVD because it offers a Spanish soundtrack choice and it's violence free.
I'm happy with it and my 3 y.o. son seems to like it so far. The illustrations,the sound quality and the stories themselves are pretty good.
Even though the narrator is excellent and very entertaining (at least in the Mexican version)the characters do not talk and I don't know if that will sustain my son's interest in the stories as he's used to more ""mature"" shows where the characters interact with the viewers. Also the narration follows the riming format.
Definitely a gentle, entertaining DVD suitable to the younger set. A good buy.",1193011200,3,678,4.803418803418803
