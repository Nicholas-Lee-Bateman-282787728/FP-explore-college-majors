8109658,5,B000EHL63E,"Something as big and amorphous as the peace movement that sprang up around the 2003 invasion of Iraq is hard to make concrete. This movie humanizes that enormous movement by narrowing the focus to a few activists in one community--the Amherst/Northampton area in Hampshire County, Massachusetts.

The activists' passion, creativity, commitment, and, yes, its patriotism come through with great clarity as the camera follows a dozen or so activists from several different clusters, not all of whom even known each other--ranging from middle schoolers to white-haired veterans of the Korean war.

It was particularly exciting for me, because I live in that community, and am acquainted with a couple of the people who were featured.

I think this movie adds significantly to the literature, and may even help some Red State Republicans understand why their neighbors go out in the street to protest, and why dissent is an essential feature of democracy.
