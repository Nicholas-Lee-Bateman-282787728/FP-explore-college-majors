4483651,3,B004VPUQWC,"i bought the whole series for a great price on the basis of other reviews.  these characters are so different than every-day American characters that it made it interesting to watch.  Parts were pretty gross, some definitely out there, and a few lines and scenes they could have left out - just didn't fit.  If you're looking for something to watch you probably won't be disappointed.  For those who may object, there are sexual references, etc. some a bit bizarre but not in your face the whole time.",1399161600,,501,4.659090909090909

4483655,5,B004VPUQWC,"One of the funniest series that have come out of Britain!  Story is based on a young Britain man who dates a young lady from Wales and all their madcap adventures between themselves, their families and friends.  I'm sure I'm not doing it justice with my description but take my word -- A MUST SEE - absolutely a riot!  I think they could have continued this series for years but I believe the writers had other commitments.  Very sad when it ending - I wanted it to go on and on.",1371859200,,479,4.230769230769231
