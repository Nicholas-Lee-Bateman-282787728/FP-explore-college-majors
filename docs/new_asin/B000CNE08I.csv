2466019,5,B000CNE08I,"the FOX FILM NOIR distribution has been releasing some forgotten classics lately. this is no exception. this little gem was released in 1951 and moves at a liesurely place. the film is more of a sleeper than an exciting thriller. though it's not a fast-paced thriller it still entertains and is never boring. after viewing the film in it's entirety, one will not be disappointed. the climax is very satisfying and makes the film completely worthwhile.

as for the DVD, overall it's a good transfer, inspite of some grainy scenes.",1143417600,4,529,4.877777777777778
2466020,5,B000CNE08I,"Surprisingly good modern Gothic thriller set in San Francisco. Polish WW11 refugee (Valentina Cortesa), after surviving concentration camps, assumes her dead friend's identity and comes to the US where she meets and falls in love with Richard Basehart. She is the ""long-lost-relative"" he has been waiting to meet. Now esconced in a spooky house on Telegraph Hill, she has reasons to fear the icy housekeeper (Fay Baker) as well as her new husband. Also in jeopardy is the little son of her dead friend whom she grows to love and think of as her own. Only a lawyer friend (William Lundigan) is empathetic to her growing suspicions and terror. Robert Wise provided taut direction to this engrossing film and the b&w photography is superb as is the location shooting in San Francisco. Cortesa spends near the entire film in panic or distress, Basehart is sinisterly effective as the overly doting husband, and Baker is very good as the housekeeper/governess whose motives keep you guessing. Excellent DVD print of this rarely seen thriller make this a keeper. Cortesa and Basehart married in real life and Cortesa went on to a long illustrious career, later winning an Oscar nod in Francois Truffaut's ""Day for Night"" in 1973. She was still appearing in films as late as 1989 in ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"".",1143072000,8,1313,4.9457013574660635
2466021,4,B000CNE08I,"The House on Telegraph Hill has all the necessary ingredients to make a terrific film noir.  It has a dark past, a tormented soul, and an intricate web of lies. Despite the mysterious and troubled concoction, these feature themes do not help deliver a genuine film noir with dark, hopeless, and nihilistic atmosphere.  Instead, it ties together a captivating thriller of a woman's lies and the troubles that follows.  The lies bring her on a perilous journey seeking a better life and prosperous opportunity after have escaped the claws of death in a Nazi concentration camp.

A soaring and spectacular view of San Francisco seen from the house on Telegraph Hill opens the film that shifts to a shot of the house itself and then to a for sale sign.  Accompanied to these three images is the voice-over of Victoria Kowelska (Valentina Cortese). She forewarns the audience about the house's ominous past.  The story has its origin in Poland and it all began 11 years, more precisely 1939, shortly before World War II.  With the war Victoria lost her home, family, and freedom, as she was sent to the Nazi concentration camp in Belsen.  Yet, she found a reason to live in her friend Karin. Karin provides a sense of hope through her rich aunt in San Francisco who is taking care of Karin's infant son Chris.  However, Karin dies, and Victoria sees her only chance for a better life by adopting Karin's identity.

The bad news does not cease to confront Victoria, as she also learns about Karin's aunt's death.  Yet, Karin's son is still alive and it offers her some hope. Once arrived to the American continent, Victoria marries Karin's distant cousin Alan Spender (Richard Basehart) who also has become the guardian of Karin's son Chris (Gordon Gebert).  At first things are wonderful, as the American Dream flushes over her like a tsunami.  Blissfully, Victoria enjoys her new lifestyle, but the dream does not last.  The true plot soon emerges, as she has traded the evil of Belsen to that of peaceful time San Francisco murderer.

The House of Telegraph Hill, as mentioned, does provide the genuine film noir atmosphere, and the issues rests within the story that accentuates the notion of hope and the dream of a prosperous future.  It is also a mood within the film that does not seem to disappear despite Victoria's past and present troubles.  One of my issues with the film is the opening in the concentration camp, which felt fictitious and stage-like.  It should also have been more detailed, as it is a crucial part of the film.  However, the film does not present a bad cinematic experience.  Instead, the audience receives a decent thriller that seems to have developed the genre film noir to something anew.  Robert Wise's vision, which has also brought us terrific films such as The Day Earth Stood Still (1951), The Haunting (1963), and the The Andromeda Strain (1971), transforms the genre of film noir where a gripping tale emerges through a woman's dangerous risk.",1142726400,4,2980,4.81532416502947

If your looking for a hard core Noir involving heists, double crosses and femme fatales look elsewhere. ---If your looking for a well acted good suspense murder story with a fairly well told story then this should make you happy.  Provided of course you have seen the best of the best already such as Hitchcocks best stuff etc.  Also some people have certain actors and actresses that they like to see.  Here there are no Top A listers but neither Richard Basehart  nor Valentina Cortesa were amateurs.  The director Robert Wise was an accomplished director helming many very good films.

2466047,3,B000CNE08I,"Yes indeed who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men (women too but a man is the villain here). Especially when big money, big estate money, is in play. That money and keeping it is what drives the plot in this one, the House on Telegraph Hill (thats in San Francisco if you want to know although evil resides elsewhere as well). But not without a few twists and turns. Which makes this Robert Wise production a cut above the average B-film noir from the 1950s.

Seems a Polish mother of a small boy was in the wrong place at the wrong time-Poland 1939 so, yes, the wrong time-and wound up in a German concentration camp. There she is sheltered and protected by another women, Karin, who knows her whole life story. The mother died a few days before the camp was liberated. Karin decided to try for the good life by pretending to be the boys mother. After being placed in a displaced persons camp she was able to get to New York City and try to claim her son and his legacy.

That is where one Richard Basehart, poor relative and guardian to the boy steps in, where the evil steps in. See he wanted everything, all the estate, and had already tried do away with the child back in Frisco town. So, naturally, he married Karin to protect his interests and seal the deal. And so he brought her back to Frisco where he fully intended to (with the aid of his honey, the nanny) do her in. But bad guys cannot win against former concentration camp survivors (even if cheats) and wholesome All-American little boys (baseball gloves and all) and so he must fall, fall hard. See the film is see how this particular evil meets his match.",1386547200,,1631,4.3618421052631575
2466048,4,B000CNE08I,"This film should not at all be as compelling and riveting as it is. It is yet another unraveling of a trite, banal plot: a wife suspects that her life is in danger and that among those scheming against her is her husband. Far better films have explored this cliched trope: ""Rebecca,"" ""Suspicion,"" and ""Gaslight,"" among others.

Yet this production with film noir elements sustains one's attention, as there are several interesting details which render this work distinctively different. The background of the wife is almost unique in the annals of 1940-50s movies: she is a survivor of a concentration camp. And a very prominent subplot, her having assumed another's identity, contributes much tension and fascination. But those two fairly original ingredients are tossed with others that are quite familiar: a house with its own unsavory history, a young child requiring nurturing and protection, an enigmatic and hostile nanny, and another man who professes his love for the wife.

This melange adds much to this ""woman-in-distress genre"" movie. Within this genre, most audiences will greatly empathize with a female protangonist's travails and fate, particularly if she is sympathetic. And in spite of assuming another's identity (a typical film noir character whose probity is somewhat questionable), the heroine in this film is certainly very sympathetic.

Much praise should be bestowed onto the leads: the very expressive Valentina Cortese as our protangonist and the impressive acting of Richard Basehart, her suspected antagonist. Her anxiety is palpable throughout the film, and he raises our suspicions at first subtly then alarmingly.

Yes, there is much that is familiar in this production, yet its sui generis components provide for a very rewarding and suspenseful viewing.",1381363200,,1788,5.375
2466049,4,B000CNE08I,i like all the movies of this era. and its a cut above the norm for sure. And Basehart always gives an excellent proformance,1376265600,,124,4.208333333333333
2466050,5,B000CNE08I,"I have watched this film several times and feel that you will also.

The film is in black and white. Much of the story is narration.  There are quite a few interesting actors who play quite a few interesting parts in this film.  However sometimes it is fun to think where you have seen them before such as Richard Basehart that in other movies played Maximilian Robespierre and Adolf Hitler.

I would go into details of the story as that is why you will watch it. There is more to the movie than just the story. Basically Victoria Kowelska (Valentina Cortesa) loses husband and house in WWII. She befriends a fellow concentration camp person and exchanges identities for a better life after the war. She moves to America (The house on telegraph hill, San Francisco) to acquire her inheritance and everything looks cozy on the surface but she has the feeling that there is something sinister going on.

Watch as the story unfolds and see if you do not feel the same thing.",1374969600,,971,4.589595375722543

2466054,4,B000CNE08I,"The House on Telegraph Hill (Robert Wise, 1951)

What, exactly, does one call a movie from the age of film noir that obviously wants to be a piece of noir, but doesn't quite make it? This is the problem I find in trying to review The House on Telegraph Hill, Robert Wise's fine...um...crime drama? Mystery/thriller? I don't know. But I know it isn't noir. And the really frustrating bit is that I can't tell you where the film breaks the rules, because that would be a spoiler. (Though if you know noir, my very saying that is probably enough to give the game away.) But it's a minor point anyway; whatever you end up calling this movie, it's quite a good one. Not as well-known as any number of Wise's other films, but as good as, if not better than, many of those for which he is more recognized (West Side Story, the first Star Trek film, The Andromeda Strain...). Wise released two movies in 1951: this and The Day the Earth Stood Still. That's a year any director could be justifiably proud of.

Plot: Victoria Kowelska (Valentina Cortese, from the 1948 adaptation of Les Miserables) is an inmate at Belsen concentration camp during World War II. She befriends another Polish prisoner, Karen Dernakova (Comrade X's Natasha Lytess, better known for being Marilyn Monroe's acting coach than for any of her own screen roles), who has family in America and the papers to prove it. When Karen dies during Belsen's liberation, Victoria, broke, hungry, and desperate for a new life, switches papers with her and heads for America. When she gets there, she's confronted by a lawyer retained by distant-cousin-by-marriage Alan Spender (La Strada's Richard Basehartwho would end up marrying Valentina Cortese by the time filming wrapped) challenging her identity; it seems she and her husband had been reported dead some time before. She manages to convince Spender that she had not, in fact, died (after all, during the period Karen was supposed to be dead, the two of them were swapping life stories in Belsen), and Spender reveals that Victoria-now-Karen is no longer broke at allin fact, she's quite wealthy. The two of them get hitched and move out to the family pile in San Francisco, from which the film derives its name. Victoria meets Karen's now-nine-year-old son Christopher (Holiday Affair's Gordon Gebbert, a child star whose career would be over by 1960), and the three of them form what would seem to be the perfect family, though the family governess Margaret (Notorious' Fay Baker) seems somewhat nonplussed, perhaps even jealous, that Christopher's mother has stepped back into his life. (You can see the problem here.) Soon after, Victoria becomes convinced that Alan means to do her harm, and turns to local lawyer Marc Bennett (The Sea Hawk's William Lundigan), a mmeber of the team who liberated from Belsen and Victoria's only acquaintance in San Francisco outside the family, for help.

It's got everything you expector should expectfrom a Robert Wise film. The script is nicely-produced, if a bit stock now and again, and it is delivered very nicely by good actors who have just a little more wrung out of them than usual. Cinematographer Lucien Ballard (The Wild Bunch) makes it all look great, the soundtrack is just right, etc. Well-plotted, well-paced, enjoyable if predictable; The House on Telegraph Hill is a good one if you're looking for a quality thriller. *** ",1361318400,2,3391,4.902439024390244
2466055,5,B000CNE08I,"I began watching this movie telling myself  ""I'll see how far I get"", not expecting to like it too much. Old suspense movies are usually too melodramatic for my tastes. I wound up being pretty entertained, and ultimately captivated by the photography-which  used shadows to generate suspense when the protagonist was in trouble. The movie was suceeding at what it was trying to do, and by the end I was invested enough to really want to know what eveyone's secret was.

The best scenes were probably the ones between the Victoria and Marget...our main character and the housekeeper living in the house she moves into. Just fantastic performances.

The acting is actually pretty good all around, and even action scenes such as a runaway car, which are usually ruined by unbelievable rear projection, were effective.

My only complaint is how dated and unbelievable the kid was directed-your standard old school generic little boy movie dialog that couldn't have been believable even when the movie was made-although it was the expected way of presenting children back then.

Definitely worth a shot.",1360454400,3,1098,5.072222222222222
2466056,3,B000CNE08I,The House on Telegraph Hill is a tautly directed film noir set mostly in San Francisco around 1950. It gains interest from a lot of location shots of the city of that time.

2466057,4,B000CNE08I,"More gothic thriller than true film noir, House on Telegraph Hill does a good job of not telegraphing all its revelations prematurely. A concentration camp survivor takes on the identity of a dead friend in order to gain passage to America through family connections, only to find that among blood relatives only her friend's young son remains alive, now under the guardianship of a distant relative-by-marriage-only. The survivor and the guardian fall in love quickly, or at least the survivor allows that to happen, and the couple move into an old family house in San Francisco, where a mysterious housekeeper/nanny also dwells. In time, the survivor comes to love her faux son and at the same time doubt the motives of both the guardian and the nanny. As others have noted, this film seems to draw from Rebecca, Gaslight and Suspicion, and at times almost seems as if it could have been directed by Hitchcock. On the surface, the story is somewhat low-key most of the time but does manage to gather strength as things progress. The ending is taut, if in many ways unoriginal and somewhat predictable, my first sentence in this review notwithstanding. Still, the script does a good job in keeping us guessing about some things until the final minutes. The acting is okay if nothing special -- William Lundigan gives his usual stolid, steady and bland performance. Richard Basehart is adequate but doesn't quite give enough texture to his character to enhance the ambiguity we're supposed to feel about him. Valentina Cortese is a bit stiff, perhaps, while Fay Baker inadvertently comes close to stealing the movie with her portrayal of the nanny. While not perfect and perhaps a little slow in the beginning -- a small fault mitigated somewhat by the use of a framing device at the very start -- this film does satisfy in the end.",1357257600,,1832,4.856230031948882

The acting was very professional and I think my favorite character was Margaret, the governess of young Chris, heir to the house on Telegraph Hill.  She had that air of the housekeeper from Rebecca, the Daphne du Maurier mystery. Richard Basehart who played Alan, the appointed guardian of Chris and recent husband of Karin/Victoria was appropriately suave, manipulative, and evil. Valentina Cortesa, the actress who plays the stolen identity role of Karin filled the part well as she struggles to overcome the horrors of war, adjust to living in a new world, and try to come to terms with the conspiracy surrounding her in the house on the hill.  There are a lot of near death scenes and one would almost think that Alfred Hitchcock had directed this movie, which he didn't of course.",1343088000,,921,4.8164556962025316
2466060,2,B000CNE08I,I have decided to watch the movie because of all the five star reviews so now I feel that I have to contribute my opinion. From my point of view all actors in this movie are badly overacting. All emotions are exaggerated to ridiculous levels. Maybe that was the norm at the time the movie was made. Now combined with relatively slow pace and linear plot it makes the movie painful to watch.,1342224000,3,390,4.3561643835616435
2466061,4,B000CNE08I,"The House on Telegraph Hill is a solid suspense and thriller from director Robert Wise. Some debate whether this film qualifies as film noir or not. Whether film noir or not, it is a great film with plenty of tension and intrigue. Opening with Victoria Kowelska's flashback to a time when she had her house and family taken from her from Nazis, we see Victoria tell of the concentration camps and her friendship with Karin, another woman in the camps. When Karin dies, Victoria makes a bold move, and decides to ""become"" Karin with the hope of a better future after liberation. Pretending to be Karin, she then must convince Karin's son and the family lawyer, Alan Spender. Alan and Victoria begin a romance and get married, but Karin begins to suspect that a relative of the family, Aunt Sophie, died as a means of foul play and that she might be next in line.

There are many Hitchcock-like moments in this film, and the director does a great job building the suspense at a steady pace to a solid conclusion. A poignant moment comes when Victoria, while at the house, feels like something is amiss even amid a blissful evening and stares at the portrait of Aunt Sophie, who appears to be looking through her. Victoria's idyllic new opportunity and lifestyle are contrasted with a dreadful feeling that something is quite wrong in the house. Also, the game placed by the antagonist and protagonist is very subtle, and you are left wondering and held in suspense as to the outcome.

There are also beautiful scenes of San Francisco and the surrounding area that help to change the mood from heavy to light.

A great thriller here, one to check out.",1339804800,,1648,4.6563573883161515

Richard Basehart does a fantastic job as the dedicated, yet greedy husband who will do anything for $$$$ !

2466068,3,B000CNE08I,"Italian actress Valentina Cortese plays Victoria, a Polish survivor of the Holocaust who takes the identity of a dead friend and emigrates to America, pretending to be the mother of young Christopher (Gordon Gebert) and eventually marrying his guardian, Alan Spender (Richard Basehart).  She has taken this identity to get a new start, because her own family is entirely gone and this is a chance to start anew - with money.  So there are feelings of guilt that haunt her through the movie as she easily carries on a pretense - all of those who would remember the real woman, Karin, whose name she has taken are also dead, and the boy had barely been born.  But Spender too is playing a game, having insinuated himself into the family for the promise of wealth as well, and after marrying Victoria and becoming the legal father of Christopher, the actual heir to the house on Telegraph Hill and the family wealth, what is to stop him from getting rid of these small obstacles to making it his own fortune?  At least so the paranoid Victoria thinks...

This has some lovely San Francisco location work - the house commands a wide view of the city, and there's a nicely done runaway car scene on the famous hills.  And Basehart is fine as the enigmatic and potentially murderous Spender, but I was less impressed with Cortese, who seems overly excitable from the get-go - yes, she'd been through the war - but that's several years in the past at this point, and she has no reason to pin all her fear and paranoia on Spender, as there's also a menacing governess, Margaret (Fay Baker), to contend with.  The film in fact seems to posit Margaret as her rival, even enemy at first but doesn't develop that angle into potential psychopathology, instead immediately assuming that Spender is the likely guilty party; and the suspenseful moments - an out-of-control car, a near-fall through a decrepit floor down a cliff - aren't all that well-handled.  I felt throughout the need for the hand of the Master, Hitchcock - this was really his kind of picture.  Wise was a fine director at times, and he did excellent work within the style, notably with BORN TO KILL (1947) and THE SET-UP (1949), but he just doesn't seem to get much juice out of this fairly ordinary storyline which seems to owe more than a little debt to films like Hitchcock's SUSPICION - with one important plot point near the end a direct lift from that film.  The final, dramatic resolution is far too drawn-out and becomes fairly tedious.  Still, for Basehart, the location work and the nice gothic house it's worth a look.",1258416000,5,2585,4.65934065934066

2466073,5,B000CNE08I,"THE HOUSE ON TELEGRAPH HILL is one of my favourite noir films.  It stars the rarely-mentioned Valentina Cortese; and is set against the backdrop of San Francisco's Coit Tower area.

Polish concentration camp inmate Victoria Kowelska (Valentina Cortese) assumes the identity of her best friend, and after the liberation of the Bergen Belsen camp, moves to America.  Once settled, she marries into the family of her deceased friend and becomes the mother of her son, Christopher.  But Victoria's life takes a deadly turn when she starts having mysterious accidents.  The brakes on her car fail, and her nightly glass of orange juice starts to taste very bitter.  Then there's her husband's close association with the housekeeper...

Shades of ""Gaslight"" and ""Rebecca"" echo through THE HOUSE ON TELEGRAPH HILL, the story of a woman driven to the brink of hysteric paranoia...only in this case it's the wrong woman!  The plight of Victoria and her guilt at having taken the place of her friend is well played, and Ms Cortese delivers a strong, sympathetic performance.  William Lundigan, Richard Basehart and Fay Baker offer strong support.

HOUSE ON TELEGRAPH HILL, directed with great skill by Robert Wise, deserves it's place on the shelf next to such noir masterpieces as ""Laura"" and ""Double Indemnity"".  Highly-recommended.",1190246400,5,1324,5.2274881516587675
2466074,4,B000CNE08I,"Using contrasted black and white cinematography director Robert Wise created the proper mood for a film noir theme in ""The House on Telegraph Hill"".  Noir femme fatale Victoria Kowelska played by Valentina Cortesa was an unfortunate Warsaw born native who endured the horrors of WWII and incarceration in the Belsen concentration camp.  Upon her liberation she assumed the identity of her closest friend who had passed away in the camp, Karin, who had sent her young son Chris to relatives in San Francisco prior to the war.

After a hard life in refugee camps she made her way to America where she learned that Karin's and now her great aunt was the matron of a huge family fortune.  The son Chris was the sole heir seeing that the old woman had recently died.  Ambitious and unctuous relative Alan Spender played by Richard Basehart was appointed the young boy's guardian.  In a whirlwind romance Basehart and Cortesa are soon married and move into the palatial Victorian mansion atop Telegraph Hill.  Cortesa and the the boy Chris played by Gordon Gebert hit it off but all is not well.

She befriends Basehart's longtime acquaintance Marc Bennett played by William Lundigan who is his lawyer and actually met Cortesa as a major involved with repatriating European refugees.  She needs a friend because she almost immediately butts heads with the sinister and sketchy Margaret, the young boy's governess, played by Fay Baker.  Cortesa also is becoming paranoid that Basehart is trying to kill her when the brakes in her car fail.

It all turns out well in the end as a righteous twist in the plot rights all that was wrong.",1167177600,6,1626,4.833935018050542
2466075,4,B000CNE08I,"""House on Telegraph Hill"" is a gothic suspense loosely based on Dana Lyon's novel ""The Frightened Child"". Sometimes categorized as film noir, this film is only vaguely so. It's very much in the mold of ""Gaslight"" or Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"" and ""Suspicion"" in placing a possibly paranoid woman in an imposing house with an inscrutable husband and a series of suspicious accidents. Is she the victim of foul play or simply neurotic? The film was conceived as a vehicle for Italian actress Valentina Cortesa, who struggled with her English but gives as strong a performance as the script allows. The art direction by John De Cuir and Lyle Wheeler was nominated for an Academy Award. The faade of  the ""house on telegraph hill"" that appears to overlook the San Francisco Bay was assembled over top of real buildings on that very site. The interior of the house is a set, but the antique Victorian furnishings are real.

In 1939, Victoria Kowelska (Valentina Cortesa) lost her home and husband to the German advance. In a concentration camp, she befriended a fellow Polish woman named Karin de Nakova whose infant son was sent to live with a rich aunt in the United States before the war. In spite of Victoria's efforts to keep her friend healthy, Karin died before the camp was liberated. Victoria assumed Karin's identity and tried to contact her aunt in the US, only to learn that Aunt Sophie had died. Four years later, Karin arrives in the US and finds that Aunt Sophie's American nephew Alan Spender (Richard Basehart) adopted young Christopher (Gordon Gebert) and lives in the aunt's grand mansion on San Francisco's Telegraph Hill. Alan romances Karin and proposes marriage, which she happily accepts. But, between Christopher's possessive governess (Fay Baker) and odd occurrences around the house, Karin begins to suspect that Alan wants her dead. She turns to sympathetic ex-Army officer Maj. Marc Bennett (William Lundigan), whom she knew in Germany, for advice.

We know that Alan married Karin/Victoria in order to secure his inheritance. And Karin married Alan for wealth and security. We can hardly blame them for this mutually beneficial arrangement. Alan is always polite and generous toward his wife. He seems to be concerned about her happiness. Could he be a cold-blooded killer with no regard for life, not even a child's? Or have Karin's constant struggles for life in the deplorable conditions of the concentration camp made her pathologically fearful? We don't know if the danger Karin sees is real or imagined. She doesn't either. And this really works. The film's ability to keep us guessing is its strength -along with the spectacular house. Valentina Cortesa has a warm, appealing presence. Richard Basehart is charmingly ambiguous. I think that Karin's confused emotions could have been stronger. ""House on Telegraph Hill"" is not the caliber of ""Rebecca"", but it is a solid suspense nonetheless.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006): Bonus features include 4 still photography galleries (5 posters, 38 production stills, 52 behind-the-scenes, and 9publicity stills), a theatrical trailer (2  min), and a good, nearly constant audio commentary by film noir historian Eddie Muller. Muller provides some interesting tidbits about the cast, points out what footage was left out of the film, and comments on the art direction. Muller also offers some criticism of the film's early scenes and weak aspects of the script. His observations of what would have made this film stronger and also more ""noir"" are spot-on. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish. Dubbing available in Spanish.",1158624000,14,3618,5.10472972972973
2466076,4,B000CNE08I,"Intent on making a star with this vehicle out of the unusual Italian actress Valentina Cortese, Fox opened up its coffers for THE HOUSE ON TELEGRAPH HILL and also used some of their finest technical talent: the gowns, the sets, and the cinematography are absolutely first-tier, and the director, Robert Wise, does his usual intelligent tricky work with editing to make this woman - in - jeopardy film extraordinarily compelling. The script seems to be a mlange of several 40s melodramas, including REBECCA, GASLIGHT, DRAGONWYCK and (most of all) SUSPICION, but the film's excellent use of its San Francisco locale helps tremendously, as does Cortese's extraordinary performance as the guilt-ridden concentration-camp survivor who steals another woman's identity.",1150588800,30,762,5.521367521367521

Let me also mention that what makes these Fox Film Noir DVDs so good is Eddie Muller's commentary.  This guy knows everything about these films, actors and directors.",1149897600,12,457,4.746835443037975
2466078,4,B000CNE08I,"This is a reminder of man's inhumanity and the suffering caused in WWII. When one has lost all family and personal possessions, desperation can move one to take liberties with the truth for survival's sake. But what is one to do when such deception has been trumped by the people living in one's own HOUSE ON TELEGRAPH HILL? With a torturous concentration camp background, it is plausible that others may be easily convinced that the immigrant is cracking up. When help is needed, who can be trusted while personally living a lie in a new country?

The viewer sees events through the eyes of the immigrant Victoria Kowelska (Valentina Cortese). Following a bit of early over-dramatization in the concentration camp, Victoria assumes the identity of a wealthy benefactor named Karen. After her marriage to Alan (Richard Basehart), Karen/Victoria attempts to prove a murderous cover-up is taking place and her own life is in danger. At the same time, others are either trying to make her believe that everything is normal or that she is delusional.

As events unfold, subtle twists may catch you off guard but the history of prior classics may render some conclusions obvious. Nevertheless, the presentation does not borrow to such an extent to make it a rehash. It is more like a tribute to favored classics with sufficient new settings for a good degree of suspense.

I do have some minor criticisms. A few unresolved scenes, like the reaction to obvious scrapbook tampering and why evidence of an explosion remains for years, are left to the viewer's imagination and logic. Deathbed confessions in closing scenes attempt to sew up most loose ends. Major Marc Bennett (William Lundigan) seems too friendly too quickly and appears nonchalant about every twisted development.

Film transfer is very good but not great. (Specs and occasional posterization/pixelization in dark tones.) With these factors and the aforementioned plot borrowing I deduct a star from an otherwise entertaining suspense movie.

2466079,3,B000CNE08I,"This is the type of film that Alfred Hitchcock could have done wonders with. Indeed, it does bear a strong resemblence to ""Suspicion,"" right down to the menacing poisoned drink (this time orange juice instead of milk!) But although the film features brilliant photography and astonishing sets, the plot has holes and there is very little suspense. Many plot elements, such as the implications of the leading ladies offence of stealing someone's identity is eventually ignored. The commentary by film noir historian Eddie Muller is actually more interesting than the film itself. Muller discusses the nature of film noir (noting that this is not exactly a true film noir) and details the juicy tidbits about the off-screen affair between leading actors Richard Basehart and Valentina Cortese which eventually led to their marriage. He also discusses aspects about the amazing set (the imposing house didn't really exist, an actual restaurant in San Francisco was used as well as sets). If anything else, this is a film that San Francisco residents would be interested in seeing , for it boasts many exterior shots of the city in the early 1950s.",1149033600,9,1144,5.090425531914893

Director Robert Wise perfectly captures the ominous sense of dread by letting this tale unfold subtlely to a satisfactory climax.  The film is anchored by a powerhouse performance by Valentina Cortesa.  You appreciate the depth of Cortesa's work here because she plays a flawed character, a Polish refugee who assumes the identity of a wealthy heiress who died in the concentration camps.  The fact that we root for Cortesa's character against the potentially malevolent forces working against her is a testament to her skill as an actress.
