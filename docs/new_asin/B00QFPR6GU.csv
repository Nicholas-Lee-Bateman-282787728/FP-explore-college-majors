8691126,3,B00QFPR6GU,"Then content of this DVD is fine, and would actually normally get a higher rating from me, cuz it's a long overdue and great idea for a DVD series, but it was frustrating that this particular DVD-R wouldn't play (or even load) on all but one of my five Blu-Ray players.  Even Vol. 1 of this same series loaded and played fine on all five of them, but I haven't got a clue why Vol. 2 isn't working, except on only one of my players.

Maybe if the seller sent me another copy that was made better..?  If that's even something they can control?  I still gave them a fully positive feedback rating cuz the disk arrived reasonably promptly, but all that was done and posted before I got around to watching it and discovered the above technical problem, which may or may not be a fluke with this one copy.

And now I think it';s too late to re-negotiae anything with the seller, or producer.  I've never had quite this problem before and so I don't know all of Amazon's rules and procedures for fixing something like this, if it can be fixed at all.

When considering buying any DVD-R, make sure you check out other people's reviews to see if number of people are having technical problems with it or not before you buy any DVD-R, and this would include even the DVD-Rs that are being issued by the big-time movie and TV studio companies.",1461628800,3,1332,4.368421052631579
