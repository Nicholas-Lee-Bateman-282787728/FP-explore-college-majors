8068631,1,B0009WK6JY,I only gave this movie one star because there was no such thing as 0 Stars. the production is awful the acting is awful the script is awful. it is very amateurish. I don't know how anybody can give anything except one star in a review for this movie. I implore you please don't waste your money on this.,1462838400,,303,4.1525423728813555
8068632,1,B0009WK6JY,"This is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. The production quality was horrendous - much worse quality than any day time soap, far worse than that of any made for TV movie that I have ever seen. The writing and script were cheesy, at best. Even if it had been well acted, I doubt it could have made any improvement in the movie whatsoever. Don't even think about watching this movie. Certainly you have something better to do with your time and money. (I gave it one star only because it wouldn't take my review with no stars.)",1313020800,,536,4.37
8068633,4,B0009WK6JY,"A fun little romantic murder mystery on a low budget.  Maureen (Marcia! Marcia!) McCormack and Christopher (still yummy!) Atkins click well together on the screen.  Some weird quirks, but all and all, a fun little movie.",1213833600,2,220,5.083333333333333
8068634,5,B0009WK6JY,"Filmed on location in Massachusetts, the film has a sharpness to it that adds to the enjoyment. Director Stephen Furst does a fine job. Maureen McCormick and Christopher Atkins make an attractive duo.",1191715200,3,200,5.090909090909091
