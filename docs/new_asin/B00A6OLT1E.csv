I really don't see why some say this Doc was so bad.  Perhaps it was the equipment they used.  I saw it on a Sony 3D Blu ray player and my new LG UHD (4K) TV and it was unbelievable in its color and depth.  Now, I have to buy the other two in the set.  3D is soooo additive.

I would recommend this title to anyone that has a GOOD 3D and 5.1/7.1 Surround System.  It is a good show-off title.

5384581,2,B00A6OLT1E,"I should have listened to Leopold. Despite the stunning color and clarity of the front cover, that is not what most of this movie shows. Very little professional lighting was used and so, the colors where bland. I did learn some things listening to the narrator but all in all I felt I wasted $15.00 buying it.",1365811200,7,310,4.456140350877193

8547034,1,B00A6OLT1E,"I have to agree with the reviews that gave this a 2 star. The only thing colorful about this 3d is the cover on the box. My husband who has snorkeled in the Pacific says the ocean is more like soup. And that is what this looks like, which I suppose is realistic, but not what I was looking for. The depth is there, so that you feel like you're actually there in the water looking at the corals and fish and eels and turtles, etc., which I found claustrophobic at times. The music doesn't seem to fit, and the voice of the narrator seems to be more suited to a Christopher Lee horror movie, which may add to the claustrophobia. I watched about 2/3 of the movie trying to like it and gave up.",1460505600,,690,4.118518518518519

8547036,2,B00A6OLT1E,"As I stated in the subject, ""Cover Glorifies Actual Content,"" sadly I believe the quality, diversity of Coral Reef live and narration is lacking.  The movie seemed to focus on one reef and one reef only.  The color and / or lighting was such that most everything filmed had a greenish hue.  Maybe this was due to a filter being used, lighting or inadequate or improper lighting.  The audio was very low tone and sometimes difficult to understand what the narrator was saying and the narrator was speaking extremely slow which did not seem natural.  Many different life forms were showcased but not all, actually only a few, were described in detail or even named as to what was being seen.

The movie seemed to focus on one reef with the cameraman turning rolling film and then shutting down to then move to a different location of the same reef and when you do this ""one reef looks the same"" as the life form diversity remains constant.  The waters were not clear and somewhat foggy in appearance.  There are crystal clear reefs and there are others.  This movie featured ""others,"" and only one.

The 3D was wonderful as you are able to view distant fish life and you knew they were in the background.  But this is clearly a ""B"" rated movie if there is such a rating for this type of viewing.  If you are used to watching any of the many BBC productions, such as Naturalist David Attenborough's 3D movie collection, or National Geographic Nature productions you will be disappointed.",1445990400,9,1484,4.622137404580153
