7890234,4,6305460159,"Very good dvd , with crisp and clear images and good sound.

Goes around several JASDF bases showing operations of F-15 and F-4.

The only remark: some commentary could be given to explain the missions shown.

Otherwise one of the best military avition DVD's I have seen.",1127606400,,271,4.723404255319149
