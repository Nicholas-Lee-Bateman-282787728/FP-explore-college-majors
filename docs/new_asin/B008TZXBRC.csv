8530313,5,B008TZXBRC,"Has become my favorite GO-TO workout video! Deep inner core workout. Appropriately paced for a good strength building and tight workout. Feel challenged by the poses, but none so complex that you will be put off do do the workout again and again. For a good solid workout that builds your inner core, I would definitely suggest this video. Very much enjoyed Sarah Starr's workout and have been to a workshop of hers and would  go again. Learned a lot of great exercises for the core. Enjoy!",1346716800,6,490,4.632183908045977
8530314,5,B008TZXBRC,"Pass me a towel please! This was a wonderful workout! Sarah's graceful flow of movements targets hips, heart and core as promised. This workout offers challenges for all levels of yoga students. Sarah encourages us to work at our own pace and comfort level, yet to reach past our preconceptions of what we think we are capable of. My core has always been a weak spot for me, but regular practice with Sarah has rewarded me with greater core strength, a wider range of flexibility and a blissful state of peace after each session. Her philosophy of honoring your body and listening for its signals helps me not only on the yoga mat, but throughout all of my day's activities.",1345939200,3,674,4.625
8530315,5,B008TZXBRC,I am an avid runner and like intensity. This video does it! It gave a great core and upper body work-out while at the same time lengthening all those tight muscles. I walked away feeling relaxed and tone. It also is easy to adapt to different levels so you can notch it up or notch it down to match where you are at. Well worth the money!!,1345075200,5,339,4.074626865671642
