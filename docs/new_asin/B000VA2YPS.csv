8217609,5,B000VA2YPS,Best independent movie about the trials and tribulations of being in a relationship with a flatulence enthusiast.,1419811200,,113,5.705882352941177
8217610,3,B000VA2YPS,"I had only seen the short edited version of this in the past. I enjoyed seeing this longer version more. Bought this for my wife to enjoy the nostalgia of seeing Ray & Joyce Atherton's house where this was filmed. They are listed as Associate Producers. Ray was my wife's brother. Nice to see Joyce as an extra, also. For the nostalgia, I would have rated it 5 stars but would rather see people buy this with average expectations and be surprised by the crude laugh inducers. Fun for a frat reunion party.",1364515200,,505,4.440860215053763
8217611,1,B000VA2YPS,"Russell (Joel Weiss)has a junk food diet that leads to his production of gas which he enjoys to the dismay of everyone around him. While his wife Heather (Shannandoah Sorin) is away, Russell watches TV. The movie consists of a ""Groove Tube"" montage humor involving fart humor. Perhaps the best feature was the ""Gong Show"" parody. Very low brow stuff.

Parental guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1350864000,3,395,4.895522388059701

Starring:Joel Weiss,Conrad Brooks,Robert Axelrod and Steven Banks.
This is a funny video,That's suited for wild parties and wild viewing by ""The Guys"".
Alot of sketch comedy that would later be used in `Saturday Night Live"" and ""SCTV"".

The Etheridges admit this is their best seller on Amazon.com and mostly women buy for their husbands and boyfriends !
Its funny,Like we said and has a great cast.",1262908800,3,537,5.183908045977011
8217613,2,B000VA2YPS,"This movie was a disappointment. It sounded like it would be really funny from the description, but only the first few minutes were good. The farts are not even real. Sound and picture quality are on a very low level, but I don't find that too important.",1228608000,3,254,4.425531914893617
