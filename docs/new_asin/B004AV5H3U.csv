4311654,5,B004AV5H3U,"Irish  Garda (Police) Sergeant Jack Driscoll is transferred from Dublin back  to his hometown in Galway on Ireland's remote windswept coast. Sergeant Driscoll faces challenges he never expected: escaping the shadow of his father and predecessor in the job Gerry, winning the villagers' respect, exposing dirty secrets. His relentless pursuit of the truth dredges up long-buried crimes, pits him against Gerry, who may hold the key to the various mysteries. But there is also a romance with a young Dublin nurse, Saoirse, who is drawn to the place and to Jack, while visiting her uncle in the area, wealthy local builder Tommy Gallagher.  And plenty of craic, black Irish wit.  The production is available in streaming format or in box set format, consisting of  three feature-length mysteries,  on three DVDs, totaling five hours..  And thank goodness, it has subtitles; else it would leave viewers struggling with some very difficult Irish brogues. I received this as a review copy.

The entertainment was produced by Element Films and Touchpaper Television for Radio Telefis Eireann (RTE, Irish television), was filmed in Connemara, County Galway, Ireland. Amid the setting's spectacular and foreboding beauty, lone cop  Driscoll (Owen McDonnell, a Galway lad, WILD DECEMBERS), who  is at the heart of his small community, and often at odds with it, fights crime and corruption. Supporting McDonnell are  Caroline Catz ( DOC MARTIN) as Dr. Maggie, Jack's love interest for an episode; Ian McElhinney (LITTLE DORRIT) as Jack's da,  former Garda Sergeant Gerry Driscoll; .David Herlihy as Garda Finbarr Colvin, with whom Jack is often at odds; Ruth McCabe, still working steadily since the Oscar-winning MY LEFT FOOT, so far as I can gauge, as Eithne Driscoll, Jack's ma; Brian Gleeson as Cathal; Sean McGinley as Dennis Costello, Matthew Mc Nulty as Brian Doyle and Simone Lahbib as Gemma Burge. The episodes are:

Disc 1
Natural Justice
 Driscoll probes the carbon monoxide poisoning of a young immigrant woman, found in an isolated trailer. On his first major case, Jack is frustrated in his attempts to identify the woman as the community closes ranks. He eventually discovers that she was called Sylvana and that she was pregnant.  And what looked at first like accidental death takes on an increasingly sinister hue. For Jack uncovers a tangled web of blackmail and sexual abuse, involving the farmer whose field the caravan occupied, a local hotelier, his father's oldest friend and a builder with a reputation for violence.  The investigation threatens to expose dirty secrets kept by a few well-respected local men--including, perhaps, his father.

Disc 2
The Stolen Child
Toddler Conal Burke disappears; his mother accuses her estranged husband of snatching him. Driscoll desperately tries to locate the boy and his father before Conal's two violent uncles get involved. Meanwhile, a police tribunal investigates possible past misconduct on the job by Jack's father.

Disc 3
The Drowning Man
Driscoll heroically pulls 17-year-old Daniel O'Malley out of the bay--too late to save him. The mystery surrounding the teenager's death deepens when Driscoll learns that his old Dublin flame has been ""vacationing"" at a cottage overlooking the exact spot where Daniel drowned, and stumbles into the middle of a national investigation into a drug-trafficking ring.

The mysteries are multi-layered.  Also original, suspenseful, gripping, personality-driven and on the dark side.  Some sex, some coarse language, for mature viewers only.  The mother of my husband, who is first generation Irish-American, sprang from Mayo.  We've been back to visit the family, and the scenery sure looked forbidding enough.  The Observer (UK) said, ""A gritty drama set against a landscape of epic beauty and isolation. Don't miss it"". I can't say it better.",1415750400,,3841,5.289950576606261

4311657,5,B004AV5H3U,"This is a really great series, well acted with interesting believable plot lines. If you like BBC mystery/drama with deep characters and a though out dialog with the beautiful backdrop of the Irish landscape you'll enjoy this.",1404345600,,226,5.135135135135135
4311658,5,B004AV5H3U,The movies are a great deal of fun. The scenery around Galway/Connemara is beautiful and the scripts well written and acted.,1402012800,,124,4.9523809523809526
4311659,4,B004AV5H3U,"Set in Ireland this is the story of a seconfd generatiion policeman. He finds himself in conflict with his father's policing style and his father's ethics.

4311660,2,B004AV5H3U,"I think that the viewability of a ""DVD"" should be noted clearly.  Although this may be a DVD, the clarity of it matches that of watching a VHS, which is very poor for a program that only came out in 2007.  Had I realized it, I would not have bought this.

4311675,5,B004AV5H3U,"Single Handed is terrific.  Nothing is sugar coated, but rather shows the West Irish coast as it is, beautiful but bleak.  The stories never fail to add a new layer to what life in that part of Ireland brings.  Owen McDonnell is terrific, although his expressions do fall into two categories, grim and not so grim.  We have lent the discs to friends who also are disappointed that the series only went two years.  For the most part, people are portrayed more fully in this series than in most American crime series.  No one is entirely bad nor good, but rather, all are a bit damaged in one way or another.  Makes for interesting viewing.",1389398400,2,638,4.495652173913044

4311677,5,B004AV5H3U,"Filmed in the harsh, yet beautiful landscape of Ireland's County Donegal, Single Handed's a simply told, grounded, grownup story of a small towns ""garda"" or policeman's life and work with a few mysteries he has to deal with.  It's very well written and acted.  No car chases, shootouts or explosions.  It's about people who live in a small town, their problems and the kind of trouble that happens with no real malevolence.  So how can this be interesting?  If you write and act it well enough, it can be amazingly good.  Incidentally, you'll probably have no difficulty understanding their speech.  County Donegal's English is very compatible with American ears.",1379808000,3,663,5.027522935779817

4311695,1,B004AV5H3U,"Like others reviewing this series I enjoyed the lead character and the lush Irish scenary.  The crime stories were well laid out.  However, I've given this series only one star for a simple but disturbing reason.  Warning this is also a spoiler alert.  Sometimes modern writers go too far.  I know we live a world of entertainment where the more shocking the popular.  One has only to look at the most successful series on HBO and Starz in the last five years for proof of that.  The more violence of every kind against people and animals, the more graphic and sensationalized the sex the greater the viewing audience.  I suspect the makers of this series felt it was time to up the proverbial bet.  And add incest into the mix.  Which they have done in this first series. Frankly I found no sense in adding this to the story.  And frankly the fact that incest occurred between the lead character and a young woman he had no idea was his half sister did not in any contribute to any of the stories.  Were we supposed to feel sorry for him?  For her?  For a country still living with deep and dark secrets like Ireland does?  It simply left this viewer with a slight case of nausea.  The HBO series ""Rome"" added incest as well to one of it's stories.  But in that case, it was a backdrop to a larger and more disturbing tale; to illustrate how one person driven by anger and revenge could manipulate a someone else who was trusting and rather nieve into doing what even in Ancient Rome was considered wrong.  It made sense as upsetting a scene as it was.  This made no sense.  Of course men father out of wedlock children all over the world.  Perhaps incest occurs on a fairly frequent basis.  But, perhaps it doesn't.  We don't have statistics on that as far as I know.  What we have in this first series is incest with no contribution to the story of this young man.  Years ago there was a film about a Sheriff in a small Texas border town.  The title escapes me.  Incest was a part of this story too.  But there again a backdrop to larger and far more troubling issues.  And unlike the writers of this series who I think did not know how to illustrate what someone might feel in this situation, in that film those writers handled the ""forbidden"" in a sensitive and compassionate manner.  The character in this series simply reacts by rejecting this young woman out of hand with no explanations while remaining silent even to himself.  Is that because these writers were not as familiar with this dilemma as they should have been.  But they knew by dropping incest into their story would bring viewers to their series like bees to honey.",1359763200,11,2638,4.44258872651357
4311696,5,B004AV5H3U,"While the Irish countryside is gorgeous, don't expect all the people to be just as wonderful.  These stories are about real people and real circumstances.  Well-written and acted.  A nice change of pace from the usual pap.",1358812800,2,222,4.945945945945946

4311698,5,B004AV5H3U,"I purchased the first two seasons of Single-Handed for my Mom for Christmas. Needless to say, she has yet to be able to watch either season. Within the first five minutes, I was enthralled with Jack Driscoll, the Garda in a small rural town in Galway, Ireland. The series is captivating, suspenseful, dark, endearing, and it lures you in like a bug in a spider's web. The characters in Jack Driscoll's world are multifaceted and allow one to relate to them on an almost personal level. The story lines are almost disturbing given that they lay bare the deep dark crevices of a world that many who have visited Ireland have never seen or even imagined. The series is exceptional and without a doubt one of the BEST I have ever watched. Enjoy!",1357084800,3,741,4.578947368421052

4311700,3,B004AV5H3U,Great views of rural/coastal Ireland. Stories were somewhat predictable. Irish brogue made it difficult at times to understand actors and stories often moved a bit slow.

4311721,5,B004AV5H3U,"Those familiar with Kenneth Branagh's Wallander series will find a nice parallel in Single-Handed.  Jack Driscoll is a Garda Sergeant on the West Coast of Ireland.  Filmed in Connemara (and we get a glimpse of the Connemara ponies in episode three), the landscape is stark, wind-swept and wet.  No one lives close to one another, but all know each other's secrets.  The secrets involve sex, incest, murder and drugs (and that's just the beginning).

Jack's father Gerry preceded him in the job.  Gerry was an effective copper but not always a very nice man.  He bent the rules.  He sinned.  He hurt people.  Jack's backstory and his family story are interwoven with the cases he is asked to solve, so that we get freestanding stories combined with an overarching plot.

The writing is superb, the atmosphere just this side of bleak.  The stories are sometimes slow to develop, the background score haunting.  These are crime stories for the connoisseur of British drama.  Owen McDonnell is excellent in the lead role, his father Gerry (played by Ian McElhinney) a close second.  The Guinness is lush and rich, the blood flowing.

4311726,1,B004AV5H3U,"Dolorous, unbelievable story lines. I was sincerely looking forward to viewing the evocative Irish landscape, even if the mysteries weren't great. But there isn't enough of Irish countryside to compensate for the atrocious stories and miserable acting. In all three episodes, the same mountains, artificially sepia-tinted (forget green), repeatedly show up in reused footage. The filming in the third mystery is so poor that innumerable, out-of-focus closeups of the cop's white vehicle glare in the viewer's eyes. Throughout, the impersonal homes are unbelievable as well, set within yards of one another in a cheap and depressing vacation rental park, or abandoned housing development. This adds a surreal quality. Ugly clichs about unwanted babies, and a stupid relationship between the cop and a girl who is preposterously attracted to him and turns out to be his sister, are repellent. This is a cynical, sinister depiction of rural Ireland, replete with stereotypes. The farfetched plots seem derived from the 1950s, or ""Peyton Place."" You'd be better off watching almost anything else. Grim, dull, affected, and a total waste of time and money.

These are Irish stories.  Not American stories.  Do not expect everything to be all better at the end.  It's much more realistic than that.  Bad things happen to good people, and everyone is not what they seem.  Just like real life.  People make the best of things and get on with it.

These are adult dramas, not with nudity or violence, but with content.  They are about the underside of life and the real monsters that go bump in the night.  They are well-written and well-acted using adult words and discussing things that people really do to each other.

4311738,5,B004AV5H3U,"Overall an excellent series. The first episode is the best. It starts a little slowly but ends with a William Trevor-ish twist to it. I thought the second episode was the weakest, though the reason I bought the series is that episode 2 has Caroline Catz in it (as the local GP and live in girlfriend of the hero during the episode). However, her role was, for the most part, extraneous to the plot, especially since she was gone by the third episode (said to have gone back to England because of the nasty winters on the west coast of Ireland).

For those who need subtitles, only the NTSC version has them.  For some inexplicable reason they are missing from the PAL (British) version.",1316736000,6,686,4.524193548387097

My wife gets tired of translating what's being said, so I just follow the movement on the screen and try to keep up.",1313020800,4,299,4.172413793103448
4311741,3,B004AV5H3U,"I was eager to see this police series set in a small town in Ireland. I have watched many British and American police shows so I looked forward to seeing an Irish version. I totally agree with other reviewers who said the main gem of SINGLE-HANDED is the beautiful green Irish countryside. The scenery is outstanding.  Much of filming is done outdoors so there is a visual feast of lovely Ireland. Saying that, I have to sadly say the other aspects of the series are rather dull and tedious. The stories have potential but the action is so slow-moving and the dialogue unmotivated.

The real problem is the writing. Garda Sergeant Jack Driscoll has returned from Dublin to his small hometown on the west coast of Ireland. It is never really explained as to why he returns and how he happens to replace his father as the head of the two-man police department. Driscoll may be working in a small town but there are lots of secrets and the locals look after each other while the police look the other way. It seems like everyone in town is hiding some dark secret and here is where the stories begin to fade into oblivion. A few secrets are evetually revealed to be hidden away again, but in most cases thinks are left unresolved or not understood.

Few, if any, of the major characters are likeable. Jack's father is under investigation for his unscrupulous handing of various arrests through the years. The townsfolk are tightlipped. There is so much potential in this series that is just wasted. In episode one, a beautiful illegal immigrant is found dead under mysterious circumstances. Jack Driscoll is determinded to find the truth. A potentially compelling story becomes a twist of confusion and a bit of farce. Driscoll questions Tommy and Tommy says Driscoll should be talking to his own father. Driscoll drives to his father and is told he should be asking Tommy questions. Anyway, the episode is a ping pong of back and forth questions. I actually wanted to keep track of how much of each show is dedicated to Driscoll driving back and forth from his parents to the police station to crime scenes and to interview witnesses. Back and forth over long stretches of country rode. I guess it is better to drive than use the phone.

Even Jack's mother is ""mum"" about Jack's father and all she knows. People keep quiet in this town. It's also a bit uncertain as to how big or small this town is. Lots of people seem to live in the country but the town has a big hotel, new office building, meeting halls and the like, yet the police station does not even have a computer. The local pub has a rotary dial phone and Jack's mother has a cassette player. Of course, everyone has a cell phone. It's a small town, yet it seems to have the mob and organized crime bosses.

I kept watching each episode even though they were incredibly slow moving. A couple big plot twists in the first episode are revealed and then hidden. The last episode was called ""THE DROWNING MAN"" and finally the writers seem to have more control over a storyline. It was still lacking but the added mystery of an unexplained drowning along with two suspicious tourists in town made more a more interesting story.

Sadly, the characters are never fully developed. Driscoll doesn't have luck in relationships and has a different lady friend in each episode..not bad for a small town police sergeant. I expected so much more and was so disappointed.",1311552000,13,3416,4.628712871287129
4311742,2,B004AV5H3U,"Extremely good looking scenery, nice musical scores to the episodes, too.  Alas, the scripts don't add up to good stories, the level of corruption exhibited by the police surpasses believability.  That's too bad, because the series has so many good aspects, but the bad-guy characters lack subtlety, especially the retired cop whose son is the lead.  Some pretty awful dialogue from time to time, too.  Bah.  Wish the writing was as good as the filming.",1310342400,9,453,4.986666666666666
4311743,3,B004AV5H3U,"We liked this movie; it is about an Irish cop in small town Ireland determined to do ""the right thing"" instead of caving into the politics. Yep there are bad guys trying to cover up for their friends.  It is low key and different from ""A Touch of Frost"" and ""Midsomer Murders"" but still enjoyable. To make this movie better it has CLOSED CAPTION.",1307836800,4,346,4.40625
4311744,4,B004AV5H3U,"The landscape plays major role in this Irish cop show. It's fabulous.
  Being an American, I didn't know any of the actors,  but I bet they have been around in other shows. This show is very well acted, and well written. I enjoyed Single-handed very much.  If you like British cop shows ( New Tricks, Prime Suspect, MI-5 etc...) You will like this.  Easy to understand accents. ( unlike Taggert ) The actors are good looking but not the ""Hollywood"" type, very realistic. You believe them, and get right into the storyline.  The stories are a bit dark ( not bad, don't be put-off) , but it really works with the landscape.  The show is not dark, as in you can't see anything because they decided to film at night, or in the rain, all the time, although that does happen sometimes - Hey it rains and gets dark in Ireland sometimes.  Most of the time it's well lit.
So - Good stories, good acting, beautiful setting, and understandable.  What's not to like?",1307836800,3,954,4.468208092485549

It was one of the best productions of a mystery series I've seen in a long time.  The area where it was filmed, Connemara, was breathtaking, and the story lines were riveting, especialy the first one.  Owen McDonnell does a great job as lead actor.  I want more!!! Wrote to ITV - there were three more seen in Ireland at the end of last year, but we probably won't see them out in DVD for quite a while.",1306800000,5,516,4.23469387755102

4311767,5,B004AV5H3U,This presents a vivid picture of the Irish country outside of the big cities....wild and beautiful with the complex relationships that accompany it.  It isn't easy holding to the letter of the law in such an environment; but getting to the truth takes the hero through difficult self discovery quite unlike what we are likely to see on American television.  This is more true to real life where things are not always black and white and sometimes it is better to work outside the rules.,1303603200,8,486,4.705882352941177
4311768,5,B004AV5H3U,"I loved this first season of ""Single Handed"" starring Owen McDonnell as a lone Irish Policeman in charge of justice in rural Ireland. The 3 stories are each gritty, complex, layered, and satifying--particularly the first one with its ""gotcha ending"". While Owen at first seems mild mannered and agreeable, each episode reveals more and more of his intense character and obession with holding offenders accountable. Throw in great supporting characters like a former flame who is not what she seems and Owens Dad who is trying to manipulate his son to cover up his own corruption and you have 3 very satisfying films/episodes akin to Kenneth Branagh's ""Wallander"" series.",1302307200,8,670,5.155963302752293

4311773,5,B004AV5H3U,"In this season one (1) of this wonderful series of ""Single-Handed, the protagonist Sergeant Driscoll (intently and fabulously played by Owen McDonnell) leaves the big city of Dublin with its big city crimes to return to his smaller home on the picturesque West coast of Ireland.  Here he replaces his retired father as the chief law-enforcer.  In a very beautiful locale he is faced with loads of debauchery that includes murder, incest, adultery, kidnapping,  police corruption, marital unfaithfulness, etc., too only it seems to be happening at a little slower pace and seemly with everyone (including his own family) involved somehow. Sergeant Driscoll takes his position very seriously and plays ""by the book"" which tends to upset the inhabitants that are use to his father who tended not to be stickler to the rules throughout his long career.  The differences in the two men and their approach to ""law enforcement"" leads to some intense conflicts.

This is a very fine series that is intelligently and intriguingly well written and acted on three (3) discs covering three mysteries running about an hour and one-half each.  This series is ""new"" to me; however I found it to be most engrossing with each of the mysteries keeping me ""spell-bound"" I look forward to further releases and diffidently will buy them because it's really very good.

The scenery and acting is clearly the strengths of this show - but the plot is slow moving and the characters are not overly likeable or memorable.  Warning to those who may think (as we did) that this would be a show the whole family could watch:  There was at least 10 ""f"" words in the first show alone, which was completely unnecessary.",1296777600,19,407,4.328947368421052
4311776,5,B004AV5H3U,"Edge-of-the-seat suspense. Scenic Irish coast makes the eyes salivate. Fresh new star, fantastic series. Irish country crime is just as riveting as London's. I was astounded and surprised.
Filmed in the Tully Cross & Connemara, arguably the most beautiful part of Ireland, you can smell the peat burning as you view bogs, mountains, lochs, pubs, Guinness, Connemara ponies, & rainbows. But the crime in this deliciously visual district is far from pleasant. An emotional suspense with intrigue as high as the Cliffs of Moor. You'll love the filmed rural beauty and be shocked by the corruption.

3 episodes, each 92 min., YES they DO include SUBTITLES
1- Home
Sgt. Jack Driscoll (Owen McDonnell, a real Galway lad) is transferred back home from the Dublin Garda. He replaces his da. A carbon monoxide death investigation leads to suspicious findings. Further evidence leads to more sinister activity. There is a web of secrets & deceit that Jack discovers. A surprise end.

2- The Stolen Child
A small child is missing and 2 violent uncles may make their own law. Jack's Dad is subject to a tribunal for past ""police work."" There is yet many local secrets that hinder investigations. Jack's new 1-month sleep-in romance is Dr. Maggie (Caroline Catz-'Doc Martin'& `The Vice') Excellent work by Catz.

3- The Drowning Man
Jack is too late in pulling 17 year old O'Malley from the bay. As always, one investigation leads to something bigger. And, as always, another romantic involvement of Driscoll becomes an issue. That issue involves yet another. High-high suspense finale! So peaked, it becomes a thriller.

Ian McElhinney (Little Dorrit) plays Jack's dad, the former Garda Sergeant Gerry Driscoll. He is a local native, a good-old-boy type, who ""turned a blind eye"" in the past, and fought local crime ""by any means necessary"". Can Jack end that legacy which goes against his morals, but is so rooted in the community? David Herlihy plays Garda Finbarr Colvin, the cop assistant handed down by dad, and used to the older cop's ways.

Bonus material: I recommend you read through this prior to viewing the 3 episodes.
Text for all: prod. Notes; O.McDonnell (Jack) notes; Catz (Dr. Maggie) notes; & Produces Alan interview.
This series contains course raw language unsuitable for children (even if they may hear those words used at home).

Ah, lookit, blimy fine Garda suspense.
`Tis `nuf fer all, mind.
