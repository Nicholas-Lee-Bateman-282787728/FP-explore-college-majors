2696578,5,B000KNL2DQ,"I've waited years for the DVD release of my favorite Newman movie, The Young Philadelphians.  That opus is a wonderful example of 1950s melodrama with wonderful characters and acting, a joy to watch.  Nevertheless, Hollywood for years busied itself with releasing DVDs of every middling new movie and TV series, ignoring quality works like TYP and the Heston/Hayward masterpiece, The President's Lady, which still is not available.  For the first time The Young Philadelphians is here on DVD.

Enjoy!

It's time now to release The President's Lady and others of its type!",1169424000,7,571,5.163043478260869
2696579,4,B000KNL2DQ,"Seven lesser-known movies from Newman's heyday, all released on DVD for the first time.  The most familiar is probably Harper, based on author Ross MacDonald's famous Lew Archer detective (Newman had the name changed to ""Lew Harper"" to fit in with his other hit movies - like Hud - which began with the letter H.)  He reprised the character nine years later in The Drowning Pool.  Other standouts in the set include Newman's breakthrough role as boxer Rocky Graziano in Somebody Up There, which was supposed to be James Dean's next role after Giant.  My personal favorite is The Young Philadelphians, high-gloss soap opera with Newman as an ambitious lawyer from the wrong side of the tracks.  Among the many people he's expected to please: his fiance (Barbara Rush), his mother (Diane Brewster, who was 6 years younger than Newman in real life), the family friend (Brian Keith), his mentor's wife (Alexis Smith), and his Princeton pal (Robert Vaughn in an Oscar-nominated performance). What's hotter than that bedroom scene with Alexis? Look fast for Adam West!  As for the set's extras, most of the films come with commentary from someone connected with the production, but it's too bad that Newman, 82 next month, didn't really participate.  You hear him for only 10 minutes - on speakerphone! - talking to director Robert Wise about playing Graziano. Otherwise there are the standard trailers, and one featurette.",1165622400,6,1417,5.02991452991453
2696580,5,B000KNL2DQ,"Warners has been doing stand-up service; this is reasonably priced the extras are fine, the transfers are excellent, and even the weakest movie in this set (MACKINTOSH MAN) is an efficient genre picture with some offbeat locations, so I'll return to it even if it isn't a masterpiece.  While the set may be short on Newman classics (a la THE HUSTLER, THE VERDICT, etc.), all the film are highly watchable; THE LEFT-HANDED GUN, an Arthur Penn film, is quite underrated, and POCKET MONEY is a funny change-of-pace.  HARPER and DROWNING POOL are well-made old-school detective flicks; I actually like DROWNING POOL a bit better than HARPER, due to its New Orleans locations and Walter Hill's script, but HARPER is a classic of sorts. If you think you'll like it, you will.",1163635200,20,769,4.862595419847328
2696581,4,B000KNL2DQ,"I've always liked Paul Newman. He was blessed with matinee idol looks and twinkling blue eyes and could've fully relied on those attributes to carry his film career. Instead, he went his own way and pretty early on established himself as a maverick personality, with an independent mindset and a determination to make it in La-La Land based on his acting, not his looks. Back in those days, when the Hollywood studios were still more in control of things, that streak of gumption could've spelled doom for an actor establishing himself. But, the thing of it is, Paul Newman can also act - and act exceedingly well. So he was given license to be a real actor, instead of a Hollywood puppet. He fought for the meaty roles he ended up with, when he could've made a solid living coasting in cinematic romances. So, yeah, I like Paul Newman.

For me, there are two utter gems in this collection: SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME and THE YOUNG PHILADELPHIANS. These are the first two Paul Newman films I saw, so they have special resonance for me. HARPER is almost as memorable, with its sequel THE DROWNING POOL and THE MACKINTOSH MAN being decent enough. Even POCKET MONEY and THE LEFT-HANDED GUN, two kinda bizarre films, have some justification for existing as motion pictures, because even at his least capable, Paul Newman still exuded style and swagger, that unmistakable Hollywood presence that made him a top cinematic leading man in his heyday.

Here's the cool thing: all the films in this collection are being released in dvd format for the first time. Now, the special features are listed by Amazon so there's no need to go into details. I will say that the extra feature I'm most looking forward to accessing is the audio commentary by Paul Newman, Robert Wise, and Martin Scorcese on SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME. I already own the individual films on VHS but the decider for my having pre-ordered this collection is the above-mentioned audio commentary. Three Hollywood legends chit-chatting about one of my favorite boxing movies? It was a no-brainer for me.

The seven films featured here vary from excellent to decent to Geez-it's-a-good-thing-I-like-you-Paul-Newman. SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME is truly excellent, with HARPER just a notch below. THE YOUNG PHILADELPHIANS, which is in my top two favorites here (due to sentimental reasons) is a highly diverting soap opera-type of film. THE MACKINTOSH MAN is a pretty entertaining spy thriller. THE DROWNING POOL is so-so; I enjoyed it mostly on the strength of it being a sequel to HARPER. THE LEFT-HANDED GUN and POCKET MONEY are my two least favorites here, even though both films have their own merit. So, obviously, for Newman connoisseurs, his best films aren't in this collection. Off the top of my head, I'm talking about classics like THE LONG HOT SUMMER, CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF, HUD, COOL HAND LUKE, THE HUSTLER, BUTCH CASSIDY & THE SUNDANCE KID, THE STING, THE VERDICT, THE COLOR OF MONEY...heck, even SLAPSHOT is a fine sports film. But, see, all those are already out in dvd. This collection is for the Newman completist, as well as for those who haven't yet had a chance to view his lesser known work. I can't, in good conscience, rate this collection as 5 stars overall, because some of the movies themselves aren't 5-star films. But it does get a very healthy 4 stars, as well as a semi-exasperated ""Well, finally!"" Man, I've been waiting for years for the dvd versions!

***********************************************************************

HARPER (1966) is based on Ross MacDonald's classic detective Lew Archer and is an engrossing mystery film. Newman is simply great as the cool and unflappable Lew Harper as he attempts to ferret out a missing millionaire but ends up, as usual with these types of mysteries, digging up more than he bargained for.

THE DROWNING POOL (1975) is the sequel to HARPER and is decidedly a lesser effort. This time out, Harper goes to Louisiana to get to the bottom of a blackmailing plot and ends up meeting eccentrics. A slow mystery, and, in a way, more of a slice of life type of film. But, if you've seen and enjoyed HARPER, you almost have to see this. Plus, it features a very young Melanie Griffith.

Paul Newman got to portray middleweight boxer Rocky Graziano when James Dean (who had been originally signed) tragically died. SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME (1956) chronicles Rocky's wild, law-breaking youth and his evolution from an unpolished street fighter to an unpolished prize fighter. Highly entertaining stuff, with a very rootable protagonist. Pier Angeli, as his future wife Norma Graziano, is unassumingly charming. But, make no mistake, Newman's nuanced performance carries the day and is what made Hollywood sit up and really pay attention.

THE MACKINTOSH MAN (1973) is a pseudo-Hitchcockian cold war thriller starring Newman as Joseph Rearden, a supposedly convicted criminal who escapes from prison in the company of a spy. Then, things get more murky and complicated. Not a bad gritty flick directed by John Huston.

THE LEFT-HANDED GUN (1958) is a sympathetic take on William Bonney, aka Billy the Kid. As westerns go, it's...not bad, though it is a bit loopy at times, with regards to Newman's off-the-beaten-path take on the famous outlaw. This time, the troubled Billy the Kid is portrayed as, more or less, on the side of the angels who seeks justice when his friend and mentor is murdered by a dastardly lawman and his peeps. This is actually one of my least favorite Paul Newman flicks.

POCKET MONEY (1972) is an offbeat modern western-comedy starring Paul Newman and Lee Marvin as two cowboys who get bilked in a cattle smuggling scheme by a two-faced rancher played by Strother Martin. This movie has its own leisurely sense of pace and takes a while to get into, as its not afraid to go off on its own tangents. This is ultimately a character study revolving around Newman's gullible Jim Kane and Marvin's dim-bulb Leonard. In fact, their performances are the saving grace of this film. For those who enjoy contemplative, off-kilter films without lots of action, this one's for you.

THE YOUNG PHILADELPHIANS (1959) offers up some very good performances, with Newman doing the heavy lifting, acting-wise. It's basically a soap opera tale elevated to the big screen and given a Hollywood sheen. Newman plays a young, gifted lawyer from the poor side of town attempting to scale Philadelphia's elite social ladder. Jilted romances and courtroom dramas abound. Personally, I really dig this film.",1161993600,56,6533,4.93

The film failed in the states when it was originally released in 1958 because audiences weren't ready for this kind of a western. But apparently it found acceptance in France :)

The hero (played by Paul Newman) is 21 year old Billy the kid, an unbalanced mood swinging psychopath, set on a killing spree, fueled by misplaced grief and desire for revenge.

His self-destructive nature brings death and pain to most of the people that embrace him, and he is finally gunned down by his friend, who turns foe in the end.

Logan plays widower ""Travis"" here, who sets out to sail around the world with his 2 daughters (teen ""Courtney,"" capable and occasional co-star Heather Rattray, and little ""Samantha,"" played by Shannon Saylor, whose acting skills are as good as a middle-aged woman).  A reporter (and potential love interest for Travis), ""Kelly,"" is believably played by Mikki Jameson-Olsen, and if you have a boat, you may as well have a stowaway for good measure (""Jesse,"" played by Cjon Damitri Patterson, another kid who's better than most adult actors).  Rounding out the supporting cast are 2 dogs, a pet seal, and a pet pelican, which are always accounted for and never forgotten in the film!  As they say, time flies when you're having fun, which is why, I bet, the steady pacing of adventures (enough for many movies) in ""Shipwreck"" will effortlessly but effectively appease the adventure seeker in us all.

He is also a ruthless killer who will stop at nothing to obtain his revenge on those who killed Tunstall (Colin Keith-Johnston), a cattle rancher known as ""The Englishman"" (actually Scottish) gunned down in cold blood.  While sympathizing with Bonney's desire, director Arthur Penn suggests that violence breeds violence; his West is a dog-eat-dog world in which no one is safe, and where the bullet of a gun dominates. Bonney is a product of that society; he knows no other way of achieving his ends.  The film also indicts the media who perpetually transform killers into folk heroes: the publicity-conscious Moultrie (Hurd Hatfield), who creates a romantic myth of a Western hero for consumption by readers in the East.  However Bonney in no way conforms to that myth, as Moultrie discovers to his cost. He is just a young man needing some form of moral guidance; however no one can offer it to him.  Although produced over half a century ago, THE LEFT-HANDED GUN still has a lot to tell us about the pointlessness of violence.",1362355200,,1182,4.914572864321608

2696658,5,B000KNL2DQ,"Somebody Up There Likes Me
  This is the earliest of Newman's work in the seven films making up Warner Home Video's Paul Newman collection.  Each film arrived in its own case embossed with appropriate art work, film credits, major co-stars and copyright date.

  The film is based on the autobiography of Rocky Graziano and was due to star James Dean who died in an automobile accident shortly after filming ""Giant"".  Newman was under contract to Warner Brothers at the time, which lent him out to MGM to do the part.

  Through the 1950's, American literature was hugely critical of the conformist nature of military service; books like Norman Mailer's The Naked And The Dead took as their theme the suppression of individuality.  In cinema, however, military service was often a search for individuality.  We saw this at work in From Here To Eternity, and much later in An Officer And A Gentleman; the Richard Gere character assumed a swaggering cool, although outside the military he had broken every relationship and literally had no where else to go.  That discovery allows Gere's military superiors to use his isolation as a motivational tool.

  The film's key discovery ocurs when an Army observer pinpoints the core trait driving the Paul Newman character: ""your punches have hate in them.  I've never seen that before in a fighter.""  The film drives forward as director Robert Wise explores the urban jungle of Rocky Graziano's past, and his use of fists as tools of escape.

  After capturing the middleweight title, the champ muses, ""Somebody up there likes me"".  His wife, played sensitively by Pier Angeli, has the best line in the film when she answers, and there is nothing more to say, but the movie continues with Bing Crosby singing a final refrain that seems unnecessary.  No wonder Alfred Hitchcock worked with the same composer for nine films.

Pocket Money
  We get an even larger inconsistency between music and script in Pocket Money, where Newman stars as a by-the-book livestock broker enlisting the aid of Lee Marvin as they form a tandem looking to buy beef on the hoof for an unscrupulous Arizona cattle baron.  They have a picaresque adventure along dusty roads that have Marvin driving a red Buick Electra seemingly designed by Picasso, or at least it is director Stewart Rosenberg's genius making the car seem a sharp edged piece of cubist sculpture.  Like a Buick, the car does its job admirably and one wishes the music did as well, but the score cloyingly reminds the actors of the need to ""keep moving on"" as though hard boiled  film veterans like Newman and Marvin needed such information .  Indeed, there are spots where the film ignores the score's advice and lingers.  This happens in a jailhouse scene where a minor character is given precious film time to explain his circumstances and the effect is to round out the story and add dimension to what was in danger of becoming a slapstick night in the local drunk tank for Newman.  Despite ubiquitous obstacles, our picaros hold up their end of the bargain although at payout time, the Arizona cattle baron is suddenly short of cash.  With Paul Newman and Lee Marvin starring, you know suitable contretemps ensue.

Harper
  Frank Sinatra turned down the lead for this picture and Paul Newman turned it into one of his ""H"" movies (others being Hud, Hombre, and The Hustler) which began its life with a main character named Lew Archer, changed at Newman's insistence to Lew Harper.  He is full of imperfections and contradictions: cerebral enough to ignore wanton seduction - insisting instead on deduction - blithe enough to take the punches, although juking and even surviving, dumb enough to walk out on the only woman who understands and loves him.  Not as sleek as Donald Sutherland in Klute, Harper is more confident than Sam Spade (The Maltese Falcon) in his ability to charm facts out of wary targets.  What he lacks in stealth Harper makes up for with an obsession to follow every lead and complete the assignment.  A legendary supporting cast includes Julie Harris, Arthur Hill, and Janet Leigh as Harper's estranged wife in self delusion mode when she takes Harper back for a night.  When he leaves the next morning she exacts a measure of revenge stabbing the yolks on their four fried eggs but it isn't enough to assuage her angst.  As a bonus, the film comes with commentary on film history by screenwriter William Goldman (Harper, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid).

 The Drowning Pool
  Lew Harper still chews gum, conveniences still defeat him (a coffee maker in the earlier movie, the seatbelt of his rental car in this version) he still answers other people's telephones and soaks the party for information, but Paul Newman is noticeably older in this sequel to the 1966 edition of Harper.  He's is still in fine shape physically (""must be all that swimming, huh?"" - a line he uses with understated sarcasm when pinning a murder on sylvan seductress Schuyler Devereaux played by Melanie Griffith).  This edition also retains Harper's defining trait, his obsession to see an assignment through.  Even after he is fired, he refuses to drop the case if he thinks there are loose ends.  Wife Joann Woodward co-stars as Iris Devereaux, having met Harper in LA six years prior where they had a liaison purely platonic in nature.  Iris left LA to be with her true amour New Orleans detective Broussard.  Tony Franciosa turns in a terrific performance in a movie with more action when a door opens than any film you have seen; it's a worthy sequel to the first edition.

The McIntosh Man
  The late Senator J.W. Fulbright famously said Americans had trouble with Vietnam because it was half nationalism which they like, and half communism which they don't like; it's understandable critics are confused by The McIntosh Man which is half spy story, half femme fatale yarn.  Pair up Paul Newman with the beautiful Dominique Sanda and audiences expect kissing not murder.  All the beauty and high art in the world don't undermine the fact that Sanda's character kills.  It's a role Lizabeth Scott (The Secret Love of Martha Ivers, The Racket) could have played without flinching.  Then too, when Sanda is not on camera and Newman is at a safe house apparently to decompress, how many times is he kicked where it hurts when his female host turns captor?  His cover blown, we get the chase across the moors, and Newman deploys his car driving skills (2nd in Le Mans, 1979) in a landscape director John Huston knew well.  James Mason is simultaneously suave and sticky as a compromised member of the British Parliament.  This movie challenges expectations rather than catering to them.

The Young Philadelphians
  Men and women have two common quests: career and love.  The extent to which they mess up on one while chasing the other is the subject of this film.  And rarely has the raw exuberance of youth in pursuit of quest been on such open display.  Newman's entrance in The Young Philadelphians has the feel of owning a 1985 Cal Ripken baseball card.  The rookie jitters are over, the star can perform at the position, the future feels unlimited.  The amazing thing about Newman is that he plays out of age.  The part called for a college student on a working summer, so you might say 22, tops.  Newman was 34 when this film was made, but he blends into the role and makes it work.  Robert Vaughn (Man From U.N.C.L.E.) earned an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Chet Gywnn, the heir to a family fortune kept from him by an unscrupulous trustee.  Newman, a tax lawyer deep into the film, gambles agreeing to defend Vaughn on a murder rap.  It's a spin of the wheel he performs again in The Verdict.

The Left Handed Gun
  The legend of Billy the Kid received an update on December 31, 2010 when Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico announced on his final day in office that Billy would not be receiving an official pardon.  The Governor noted that his reading of the historical record allowed him to believe that such a pardon was indeed offered to Billy in 1879 if he would testify at a grand jury inquiry.  Billy testified, but the pardon offer was  rescinded and Governor Richardson noted that he had no evidence as to why.  Some voiced the sentiment that history was best served by leaving it alone.  The opposite is almost certain to happen.
  The Governor's action and the movie The Left Handed Gun are both testaments to the attraction of the Billy the Kid legend and its ability to endure.  Instead of a pardon, an amnesty is at stake in the movie.  As in The Young Philadelphians, at age 34, Newman plays a role intended for a 21 year old.  It works because of Newman's method style acting, his ability to engage with other actors in the pranks of children so that they come across not as grown men but as overgrown 12 year olds.  There are points when the script aids and abets the process with dialogue spot on for adolescents.  When Billy breaks the peace established by the amnesty, he learns that ostracism can be a worse fate than death.

  If costs can be controlled the way they were in this spare and lean Western directed by the noted Arthur Penn, it should be no surprise if a movie update occurs on the heels of current events.

  There are concerns the collection doesn't contain Hud, doesn't contain Hustler, but those films cost $25 each almost anywhere.  For that price, you get Newman in a film sequence from young star through through middle age, where its possible to see the method style that gave life to a script, and carried an entire film.  Your basic good deal.",1302739200,2,9603,4.740338164251208

2696660,5,B000KNL2DQ,"This black and white 1958 version of the life of Billy the Kid is very well acted by Paul Newman, who portrays Billy as a somewhat backward, impulsive, childish young man - he died at age 21 - who was unable to read. Billy is taken in by a kind rancher who is transporting his rather large herd of cattle to Lincoln, New Mexico. Some of the ranchers in Lincoln want the sheriff to stop the kind rancher, a man who hates the use of guns, so that the market will not be glutted and the prices lowered. The sheriff and three of his deputies go out to the herd and shoot the rancher. Billy is outraged and swears revenge against the four murderers. The film tells how he and two fiends take revenge, how he is befriended by Pat Garrett, how he is offered amnesty but refuses it because he has not yet finished taking revenge, and why Pat Garrett decides to become the sheriff and arrest him.",1293494400,4,887,4.254437869822485

2696663,4,B000KNL2DQ,"That was the Wild West, not so wild though but quite wild yet. A poor kid who was born in that atmosphere of violence, who found himself alone, walking in the wild, carrying his saddle and his gun is recuperated by some rancher taking a small herd to Lincoln. For obtuse reasons that have probably to do with some economic vengeance, the sheriff and three deputies kill the rancher, an old unarmed man, in the morning at the top of the pass leading to Lincoln. The young man, Billy the Kid, reacts in a strange way and will not really change his mind which is not his mind but his habitual way of thinking. He wants justice, hence he is going to stand and challenge the four people. Then the rest is details you can discover them all by yourselves. The film is good because the young ""Kid"" is shown as being slightly slow in his brains. He is practically adopted by some people in a Mexican city next to Lincoln, but he rapes the girl because he cannot accept things not to go the way he wants them to go. And that will be his doom. The film is also good because it shows how those who had a star, sheriffs or marshalls, could do anything they wanted, more or less, and rather more than less. And they definitely shot before being shot at. Preventive self defense, even when they could not say whether the man had a gun or not. Preventive self defense. The last reason why this film is still worth seeing is because we can really watch a good actor being born. Small touches here and there show the humane side of things, of this ""Kid"", a flute, or an expression on his face, or his negotiating the lie that he could read though he could not. I will regret though that this slightly mentally slow ""Kid"" is not kept from beginning to end, but that is how the film is directed. He used his guns or other defensive method as a reflex of self-preservation more than of violence. He was completely absorbed and possessed by the outside world seen as a potential danger, which is total distraction, if not the sign of a deranged mind in a way. But we only get that feeling from time to time, not always. That's a regret of mine.

I've read articles and seen video clips of Vidal, centering on how he thinks Penn destroyed his play and screenplay.  Vidal may have a bit of a point almost no one else makes about Penn and his ways, yet this is still a good movie.  No doubt, significantly because Paul Newman plays Billy.  Newman has always had the way of playing the contemptuous punk with the undertone of dangerous and needy instability.

No doubt, the movie also works as another great story of mythic America, recast. No matter what Vidal thinks, he gets some of the credit, too.

Interestingly, historians like Robert Utley seem to have proved that Bill was not actually left-handed.  The famous picture was printed backwards.",1223337600,,865,5.0

2696677,4,B000KNL2DQ,"Paul Newman may be the quintessential film star of the past half century; his career mirrors both the highs and lows of the industry, from the end of the 'studio' system to the 'artist'-driven era that continues, to some extent, to this day, and ""The Paul Newman Collection"", while lacking legendary titles like ""Cool Hand Luke"" or ""Hud"", does include some VERY credible performances!

""Somebody Up There Likes Me"" (1956), the earliest of the collection, is also one of the best. After the fiasco of Newman's film debut, ""The Silver Chalice"", he left Hollywood for Broadway, but when James Dean died prior to production of this film, Newman was tapped to play Rocky Graziano, and with first-class talent on both sides of the camera (Robert Wise directed), a warm, funny, and ultimately inspiring boxing classic was created. Note Pier Angeli's excellent portrayal as Rocky's wife (certainly an inspiration for 'Adrian' in Stallone's ""Rocky""), watch for Steve McQueen's unbilled appearance as a young hood, and try to ignore the sappy theme song, and you'll love this film! (5 stars out of 5)

""The Left-Handed Gun"" (1958), Arthur Penn's film directorial debut, is a retelling of the 'Billy the Kid' legend, with the 33-year old Newman a bit 'long in the tooth' as the teen-aged gunfighter. The approach is original, suggesting Billy was more a confused, isolated kid searching for meaning and older authority figures he could believe in, and ultimately becoming a victim of circumstance and his own reputation. Low-budget, but effective, Penn lingers on brooding shots of Newman, and you may see why so many early critics compared him, physically, to Marlon Brando. (3 1/2 stars)

""The Young Philadelphians"" (1959), Newman's last film under his initial Warner Brothers contract, offers one of his best early performances. A slickly entertaining drama of a rising young lawyer with a society 'name' and a family secret, director Vincent Sherman plays up the 'white collar/blue collar' conflict in his life, while introducing a top-notch supporting cast, including Brian Keith, Barbara Rush, Alexis Smith, and Oscar-nominated Robert Vaughn. Long, but NEVER dull! (4 1/2 stars)

""Harper"" (1966), offers Newman at the top of his form, in this entertaining update of the 'Film Noir' detective film. Down on his luck, but still a man of ethics, Newman tackles a simple case that turns complex, with an A-list group of suspects, including Lauren Bacall, Shelley Winters, Julie Harris, Robert Wagner, and Arthur Hill. Watch for a wonderful turn by Janet Leigh as his soon-to-be-ex-wife, and savor director Jack Smight's colorful homage to classics like ""The Big Sleep"". (5 stars)

""Pocket Money"" (1972), is more a testament to the confusion both Newman and the studios felt over the era's changing public tastes, than a great piece of filmmaking. An off-beat comedy about dim-bulb cowboy Newman and seedy promoter Lee Marvin buying cattle in Mexico, the pace is so laid-back that the story seems to drift, unsure of which direction to take. There are some funny moments, but you may end up scratching your head by the end. (2 stars)

""The MacKintosh Man"" (1973), directed by John Huston, is certainly a lesser effort by both director and star, but still quite watchable. A gritty spy drama of agent Newman investigating a 'leak' in British Intelligence, Huston plays up locales in Monte Carlo and his adopted home of Ireland, offers warmly engaging James Mason and Ian Bannen as suspects, and gives audiences a chance to hear Newman attempt an Australian accent! Forget Dominique Sanda's inept performance as spy chief Harry Andrews' daughter, and you might enjoy it! (3 stars)

""The Drowning Pool"" (1975), Newman's reprise of his ""Harper"" character, is a far less successful film than the original; New Orleans doesn't 'suit' Newman's detective persona as well as L.A., and the characters, while off-beat, lack charm. There are 'pluses', however; Joanne Woodward is always watchable, especially playing with her real-life husband, and Melanie Griffith, in the 'nymphet' stage of her career, has some sexy moments. The finale is tense and claustrophobic, and makes up for some of the earlier lack of suspense, but, all in all, the film is routine, at best. (2 1/2 stars)

2696678,4,B000KNL2DQ,"I bought this collection being a young fan of Paul Newman, having only seen most of the bigger classics (Cool Hand Luke, The Sting, Hustler, Butch Cassidy, etc.) and bought this boxed set mainly because I heard ""Harper"" was a good movie.  After watching them all finally, I can say that it is well worth the cost of the set to buy.

The best film in the set for me ended up being ""Somebody up there likes me,"" as I had no idea how much other boxing movies have taken from this one since it came out.  Paul Newman is awesome in the lead role, and everything about the movie (story, acting, fight scenes) it top notch.  This, along with the underrated Diggstown are probably my two favorite boxing movies I've seen now (I prefer them to Raging Bull, where the fight scenes are too artsy).

""Harper"" was indeed enjoyable, but I found myself enjoying ""The Drowning Pool"" slightly more, as it had the great climax at the end where the movie got its name from, and overall was just a fun movie.

""The Young Philadelphians,"" and ""Pocket Money"" were both slightly above average as well, with the first being a romance driven story that my girlfriend also enjoyed, while the latter was very funny in parts and driven by the quirkiness of Newman's character.

The only two movies in the set I wasn't blown away by were ""The Mackintosh Man,"" and ""The Left-Handed Gun.""  Even still, Mackintosh was an average spy movie that picked up towards the middle with his escape scenes, and was certainly worth watching once.  Having seen too many Billy the Kid movies as it is, ""Left-Handed"" was the only movie in this set I probably won't watch again.

Hopefully another Newman box set is released in the future, as he certainly has a deep enough catalog of movies to uncover hidden gems like the ones here.",1185235200,2,1787,4.538940809968848

to properly assemble a major film star's career works on dvds.
It is a valuable boxset at a very reasonable price for the consumers.

2696680,4,B000KNL2DQ,"Paul Newman is one of the all-time great movie actors with a career that now spans six decades.  Among his biggest movies are The Hustler, Hud, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Sting, Cool Hand Luke The Verdict, The Color of Money (for which he won the Oscar) and even Cars.  None of these movies are in the Paul Newman Collection, which features seven of his second-tier efforts.  That does not mean they are bad movies, merely not as big.

In chronological order, the first movie in the set is Somebody Up There Likes Me, a biopic of boxer Rocky Graziano.  Directed by Robert Wise (who had previously made one of the best boxing movies ever, The Set-Up), this is an entertaining film of a man successfully wrestling his inner demons to become a success.  In one of his earliest roles, Newman is already showing why he a cinema immortal.

The next movie is The Left-Handed Gun, a decent, if unspectacular, version of the Billy the Kid story (the best version of this story is Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid).  Newman, as the title character, plays Billy similarly to his Rocky:  a self-destructive outlaw.  Unlike Graziano, however, Billy never finds redemption through family and friends.

The Young Philadelphians has a more easy-going Newman playing the ambitious Anthony Lawrence who climbs the social and business ladder, often with more than a little ruthlessness.  When his best friend is accused of murder, his efforts towards acquittal threaten both his happiness and reputation.  This is an entertaining melodrama.  A little bonus is seeing a pre-Batman Adam West as a man who is very briefly married to Anthony's mother.

Harper is the first of two Newman movie adaptations of Ross MacDonald's Lew Archer novels (the name was changed to continue Newman's string of ""H"" movies:  Hud, Hustler, etc.).  This fun private eye story is a real all-star flick:  it also stars Janet Leigh, Lauren Bacall, Robert Wagner and Shelly Winters.  The plot deals with Harper's attempts to find a missing - apparently kidnapped - man; in his search, he unearths all kinds of family scandal.  The sequel (and last movie, chronologically) is The Drowning Pool, which transports Harper to New Orleans to help an old flame with a blackmailer.  Like most sequels, this is a pale shadow of its predecessor, but it has its moments.  It also has Melanie Griffith in one of her earliest roles.

Pocket Money is probably the weakest in the set, an amiable but meandering movie with Newman as a modern day cowboy hired to buy and transport some cattle for a shady businessman.  Lee Marvin co-stars as his friend and partner.  It's a movie in which the parts just don't seem to fit together all that well.

Finally, there is the Mackintosh Man, a spy flick with Newman as a British agent out to stop a Soviet network inside England that specializes in smuggling people out of the country.  While this is an interesting movie, Newman's foray into James Bond territory is a little too serious to be fully enjoyed.  From an acting standpoint, this is probably his least compelling role in the set.

There are lots of bonuses with the set, including commentaries on the first four movies; the best of these is William Goldman's amusing and biting track for Harper.  On the Amazon rating system, Pocket Money is a low-three stars, The Left Handed Gun, The Mackintosh Man and the Drowning Pool a straight three, and the remainder four stars.  As is my practice with boxed sets, I average this out to a high-three stars or low-four, but the extras push it up to a comfortable four stars.  You don't get the best or most well-known Newman with this set, but you do get a good sampling of his talent and range.",1179014400,13,3705,4.749608763693271

8158406,2,B000KNL2DQ,"Review of The Left Handed Gun
Hot Toasty Rag, July 10, 2017

I guess, if you really like westerns, you can give The Left Handed Gun a try. Im not a die-hard fan of the genre, so the movie has to be really riveting for me to enjoy it, like Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, or the remake of 3:10 to Yuma. If you're like me, stick to the exciting ones, because The Left Handed Gun isn't one of them.

Paul Newman plays Billy the Kid, a somewhat spastic murdering cowboy. He relies on his sidekicks when hes in a jam, enjoys his women when hes in the mood, and shoots his enemies when they're in his way. Thats pretty much it. Its not particularly exciting, and if you like to see Paul Newman as a bad boy, there are countless others for you to choose from.

To be fair, there is one scene towards the end (no spoilers, don't worry) that is very good. While many people die in this film, one person dies a slow death in this particular scene, and its pretty sad. Paul Newman finally shows remorse over this death, and in this one scene hes allowed to act for the camera, as opposed to the rest of the film.",1499644800,,1098,4.121495327102804
