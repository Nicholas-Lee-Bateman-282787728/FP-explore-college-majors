8744672,2,B019C6X1H6,The first portion of the film was wonderful and when the teen warlock and his friend were ready to go to Miami the movie reverts to some other location with older woman that had nothing to do with the teen warlock.  I regret renting this film a HUGE disappointment.,1503446400,,265,4.408163265306122
8744673,1,B019C6X1H6,"I know DeCouteau's films are BAD, but Teen Warlock was bad 30-minute sitcom bad. And Scream Queens was a clip show with these three women sitting around praising his bad movies.",1497398400,,177,4.741935483870968
8744674,1,B019C6X1H6,666 :Teen Warlock was only about 40 minutes long then some stupid other movie started to play . I feel like I was ripped off . I do not recommend renting this movie.,1488153600,,165,4.03030303030303
8744675,5,B019C6X1H6,"this movie is great!  not only does it star two power ranger actors (which i am a freak for!), it's a decoteau film too! bonus! i just love it!",1478908800,,143,3.9310344827586206
8744676,4,B019C6X1H6,"Okay, I will admit that it's a bummer that the main feature ""666: Teen Warlock"" is only 31 minutes long. It's a bummer because it's so much fun that I would've loved to have it seen it expanded to an actual feature film and not just a short film. What follows is a 47 minute edit of the 2014 film ""3 Scream Queens"". I think I liked better as an edit, because the focus is more on the scream queens and less on the guys showering and whatnot. If you are a David Decoteau fan, I would say to rent this before you buy. Some people seem to be pissed about the short runtime for ""666: Teen Warlock"". However, I didn't find this movie a waste of my time or money because I knew what to expect.",1477180800,2,687,4.021897810218978

8744678,1,B019C6X1H6,"The WORST Decoteau movie yet. The actual movie is only 31 minutes long. The rest of the DVD is severely bad edit of ""3 Scream Queens""",1474934400,2,133,4.153846153846154
