183384,5,1562550888,"Thundering across the larger than life screen ""Dances"" transports the viewer back into a time past when the buffalo and native Americans coexisted, naively unaware of their impending fate under European  rule.
While the film is not without fault,  particularly its tendency to  replicate the faults of countless Hollywood films in their one-dimensional  characterisation of native Americans as exotic curiosities (a criticism  also applicable to the film's portrayal of the cavalry soldiers as  uniformly savage), it nevertheless overcomes these with its compelling  story-telling and provocative thesis.",935712000,,604,5.953488372093023

There were deleted scenes which could actually make you look at some of the story a little differently. Longer lengths of scenes in some parts, more scenery to be scene, more fighting and more buffalo and more of ""Smiles A Lot"". I can only remember character name since I watched it a few days ago.

183428,5,1562550888,"I respect and admire the people who first discovered and built their cultures on the great continents separating the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. They were brave and exceptionally capable, possessing a profound wisdom of the natural world gained over millennia of living in harmony with the web of life. This movie presents a white man who is a seeker, in conflict with his duty to play the role of conqueror on the Western Plains. He strives for peaceful and respectful encounter with the native people. His progress in awareness, and creative approaches to becoming a student, partner and peacemaker is deeply moving and heartwarming. I believe this was the first major commercial movie to have the native actors speak in their own (Lakota) language, in a natural manner and with extended dialogs among themselves (without white characters). The native characters are presented as intelligent, sophisticated, soulful, with their various strengths and weaknesses of character. It's a total upending of the previous TV and Hollywood representations that is much more respectful, believable and realistic. Seeing the Great Plains presented as wilderness was also thrilling to me. The hatefulness, cruelty and ignorance of the US Army seemed to accurately represent what we know of their actions of those times. The movie should be seen as one of the most stirring, compassionate renderings of the native culture in the northern Great Plains in the latter 19th c. in their doomed encounter with European invaders, and one of the great achievements of 20th c. American cinema.",1514764800,,1573,5.246031746031746
183429,5,1562550888,"Favorite film! Spectacular story, love the characters-even the animals. I still tear up with certain scenes and count Dunbar's head injuries throughout the movie. I've watched the movie, different versions, at least 20 times. I still am in awe when I watch it again and again. I enjoy the details like when Dunbar brings Stands with a Fist back to their summer camp and I catch a glimpse of Wind in His Hair's gorgeous locks as he approaches Dunbar. Sighs; if I could have hair like that!...or the relationship between Dunbar and Two Socks. ...and of course, the developing relationships throughout the film.

183430,5,1562550888,"Fantastic movie. Made me tear up a bunch of times. Also reminded me how much I hate miscommunication and the downfalls that result from said cause. If only we could clearly, without question, within seconds and with complete accuracy, measure the good in a person and their short and long term intentions. There's too much grey area, even today, in this regard, although we've made great progress since the time that this movie represents. Hopefully one day we can get past even more of this confusing grey area with greater efficiency (through better education in regards to human psychology [there seems to be so much focus on learning how to best manipulate the world outside ourselves, meanwhile, so many of us lack a solid understanding of ourselves/human psychology, seemingly thinking and hoping that our life experience will be enough to discern the nuances of human thinking and that not have a strong understanding of fundamental human playschool won't significantly hold us back; what a foolish mindset; human psychology should be built-in to the basic, general learning educational system, not regarded as an optional class exclusive to college. /END RANT :P] and through other technologies such as 100% efficient lie detectors and/or mind reading and/or 100% efficient language translators) and truly be a loving, efficient union of humans, worldwide.",1514592000,2,1364,5.261467889908257

We came under the banner of a christian god, but no true god would ever permit the horrendous behavior that our race displayedwiping out the buffalo to starve a beautiful people who were one with nature and more spiritual than any form of christianity or other religious manifestation.

Despite this extended edition having been bloated to 240 minutes, I recall the original theatrical 181 minutes as far more engaging and emotionally powerful. The most memorable scene in the original for me was KC running with wild abandon with his wolf buddy, and I didn't notice this scene in the extended version, or maybe I nodded off?

183481,3,1562550888,"The best thing about this movie is that it has actual Native actors playing the parts of Native tribal members living out west in a bygone era rather than a bunch of white actors covered in Man Tan & wearing bad wigs for such things, as in far too many previous Hollywood films.  Outside of that, it's not really much to write home about.  Dances with Wolves is a love story about two white characters (the leading roles) set against a Native American back drop.  The female lead in the story was taken in by the tribe during the wars after her family was killed.  She fell in love with and married a tribal member - who conveniently gets killed before the white male lead makes his appearance.  This is a Hollywood flick, so the elaborate Native regalia is worn for every day activities & never gets dirty, and the white leading actors' hair is always perfectly styled - the female even has an updated shag, something unlikely for the place & time depicted (as is the story itself...)

183521,5,1562550888,"Although the Sioux were historically among the top two Native tribes in hostility to White people, this film was a breakthrough in authenticity in the Wild West genre by using all Native Americans as the Indian characters, down to the kids.  One reviewer, who was an actual Lakota man, criticised the Lakota language used because it used the female gender form of the language, but this was not a problem at all for me.  Was not able to find an actual historical example of an adult White man being adopted as one of their own by a Sioux clan, but the film had a very authentic feel to it for the most part.  It was filmed in the Badlands and in Wyoming, so the scenery was definitely authentic.  The massive buffalo hunt did Not use CGI--the 3500 buffalos were real, except for the ones shown as being shot down.  In those cases, expensive animatronic robot buffalos were used.  The late blooming romance between Lt. Dunbar and Standing With Fists (a White woman captured as a girl) was done with good taste and was an absorbing tale, as was the whole movie.",1499990400,4,1059,4.518324607329843

183533,5,1562550888,"Review of Dances With Wolves
Hot Toasty Rag, June 18, 2017

I have a love-hate relationship with the Academy Awards; in 1991, the Academy correctly awarded 7 Oscars to Dances With Wolves. This is a fantastic movie. If you haven't seen it yet, rent it this weekend.

The film opens during a Civil War battle. If you are impressed by Kevin Costners acting and directing during this first scene, youll like the movie. While he won the Oscar for Best Director, he unfortunately lost Best Actor that year. Since its my intention to praise rather than rant during this review, Jeremy Irons will be spared for the moment.

Costners three-hour masterpiece chronicles one mans relationship with the Native Americans near his outpost after the war. Its a love letter to American scenery, an homage to the people that land belongs to, and a beautiful representation of Michael Blakes novel.

Kevin Costner, usually known for charm, All-American good-looks, and sports movies, shows so many hidden talents in this film. Dances With Wolves is a true masterpiece, and unlike other epics with bloody battle scenes like The Last of the Mohicans, this one can be watched over and over again. Its touching, charming, delicate, and grand. Its pretty obvious, going into an epic Civil War/Native American movie, that there will be some tragic scenes. But theres also humor, love, and grace, and the combination of all elements make it a truly classic film, one that will be watched and appreciated for generations to come.",1497744000,,1502,4.948412698412699

The story is of a soldier, John Dunbar (AKA Dances With Wolves) and his growing admiration for and friendship with the nearby Sioux tribe, and how that friendship crucially affects his life.  Two bloody scenes are inexplicable: first, when John is alone in the fort, what caused his forehead to become bloody(?), and second, when John first encounters Stands With A Fist, she is supposedly covered in the blood of her just-killed husband, so why is his body not seen nearby?",1491350400,,646,4.657894736842105

183598,3,1562550888,I don't get most movies that win a lot of awards.  I watch a lot of movies.  To be entertained.  And because of who is in them a lot of times.  I don't care if they are arty.  Or if they take a lot of liberties with the story or whatever.  To me  Dances With Wolves  takes itself too seriously as does Kevin Costner.  I thought this wasn't as good as Silverado.  And at over three hours long it is hard to sit through.  I do think it gets better after the first time you've seen it.  There are some good scenes like the buffalo hunt.  But again I don't see what the overall big deal about this movie is.,1486252800,,603,3.925

183615,5,1562550888,"This a really excellent movie.  I have read criticisms of the movie suggesting a ""white savior"" theme.  I cannot say I see it that way.  It seems to me this was a story about a troubled, noble person, meeting and being renewed by other noble persons.  I found the story very touching.

The movie is obviously of Academy Award stature, having been awarded multiple awards.  The musical score is exquisite.  Kevin Costner directs and appears in two of my personal favorite modern westerns, the other being ""Open Range"".  These fine movies have renewed my heretofore waning interest in the American Western Movie genre.  Thank You...",1483747200,,630,4.923809523809524

183636,5,1562550888,"Fantastic movie of white man and Indians getting along and learning from each other. They become friends, and Lt. Dunbar (Costner) develops a relationship with ""Stands With Fist"" (McDonnell) a woman who lives with the Sioux after losing her husband to the Pawnee. A timeless classic. A story of adventure, love, friendship,  trust, undetstanding, action, acceptance, settling minor in differences, and courage.

183644,5,1562550888,"This is truly a fine movie and represents Kevin Costner's best, both as an actor and a director. It is a Western but almost unique among Westerns I've seen in that virtually all the featured characters, save Costner's, are Native Americans...or in the case of Mary McDonnell's, Stands w/a Fist, adopted by the Indians. The treatment here of Indians - especially the Lakota Sioux - is truly remarkable. While some aspects of Plains Indian life are idealized, it is for the most part a fair and balanced treatment. The Buffalo hunting scene is probably the best portrayal of that integral aspect of Plains Indian life ever put on film and the inter-tribal warfare and social mores, including marriage and death, are all well depicted. Costner and McDonnell deliver fine performances, but, to me, the Native American characters are more memorable. From Graham Greene who plays the holy man, Kicking Bird; to Rodney Grant, who plays Wind in His Hair; to Wes Studi who plays the Pawnee warrior chief; to Tantu Cardinal who plays Black Shawl; and others...all deliver outstanding performances...and they are all Native Americans. This is Graham Greene's finest performance among those I've seen and it's certainly Rodney Grant's best. When I recall aspects of this film - and I do that often - it is the scenes depicting Indian life and the Indian actors I recall. Costner, I believe, peaked with this work; everything since has been spotty. I don't think he'll ever top this effort; or even come close to it for that matter. In addition to the awards recognition it garnered when released, it has justifiably been selected by the Library of Congress for inclusion in the National Film Registry...It is that good.",1480982400,17,1707,4.951219512195122

183690,3,1562550888,"Love the movie, but the quality of the DVD is really marginal.  Perhaps there have been so many tech improvements since this was shot that it needs to have a re-work.  It plays like a 3 generation dubbed (duplicated) off of the first generation material.  The sound at its highest on my TV is just average volume - which is very surprising.  I have not received a DVD that I considered marginal standard, but this version is.  I don't have a blue-ray so maybe that would make a difference.
The movie is just such a wonderful classic that I'll keep it just to have it.  But either tech has changed a lot and MGM (who I guess bought the Orion library - the original distributor) doesn't see the need to re-master or clean up the original negative.
It surprises me with a Best Film Oscar and Best Director along with other Oscars that Kevin Costner hasn't stepped in and done something about this film.  Perhaps he sold off the rights.",1474329600,,932,4.447058823529412

Another scene that was missed was in the buffalo hunt.... an autumn one....  & so on....

It bugged me about Mary McDonnell's hair.  Maybe not every Lakota women wore braids, but do you suppose they had bangs and layers and their shoulder length hair was blowing around in the breeze, (likely wind, it is set in the Dakotas). I know she wasn't born Lakota, but she had lived there for a long time.  You gotta overlook that hair thing, if you are inclined to be irritated with such trivia, (like me), and the fact that the only white man on the prairie for probably many miles happens upon the only white woman, (with crappy hair), for miles around.  Really? Kevin couldn't have fallen for a Lakota chick?  Actually it would be nice to see a big budget Hollywood movie completely centered on a Native American village/people, without the need to insert white guys into it.  Even if the good white guy is Kevin Costner.  Maybe it's been done and I missed it.  Still a good movie.",1463788800,2,1102,4.561224489795919

183817,2,1562550888,"After watching this film I said to myself, ""I will never watch this film again!"" One of the main problems with it, is that it is so utterly contrived and it is also without a doubt, un-American. I know there will be a few people reading this whose brains are melting right about now, but it is true. I don't want to hear about the ill treatment of Indians at the hands of the whites either, I am talking about this movie.

Lets look at the nutty officer who sends what's his face off to his remote post then quickly blows his brains out. What was that all about? The only reason that was in there was to get Costner alone at his new post. Then, of course, the soldiers at the fort desert their post and the driver who was bring them supplies and Costner gets killed, all so Costner can make friends with a wolf, Indians and an Indianized white woman whose Indian ""husband"" just died so she can be free to run off with Costner! Let me know here, if this wouldn't be described as very, very contrived story elements.

It just goes on from there, but let me write about the rest of the film. The photography is nice, some of the acting is very good, especially from the Indians. Costner's acting isn't much to be desired with his monotone ramblings, etc. The film is very slow paced and should have been cut down by about 45 minutes to an hour.

Now let me explain how it is un-American. We have an officer of the American Army who deserts his post to fraternize with Indians who are even shown to be killing white people because they hunted buffalo. Then he ultimately gets arrested by the soldiers who come to the fort. The movie makers show all the whites and all the American soldiers as savages. They can't read and use books for toilet paper, they beat Mr. Dances With Wolves and taunt him like the Romans taunting Jesus, the main character even realizes that he is a traitor, however, we are supposed to identify with him. The viewers are supposed to side with Mr. Wolves and the Indians who are friendly accept to the white people which is all of them except Costner and the white woman who is living with the Indians.

So, if this wasn't all enough, one of the last scenes is Costner being hauled away to be hanged or shot and the soldiers see a wolf and take pot shots at it. Now a real wolf, even one used to people would skedaddle once all these soldiers started firing at him. But the writer and director show the poor wolf standing there looking at his friend, Costner, getting shot. This scene is for the audience to be so outraged at the United States soldiers that we cheer when the Indians massacre them! It is one of the dumbest and most disingenuous scenes in movie history.

The film is an outrage in its storyline and underlying message. Costner should be ashamed of himself for making such an idiotic movie.",1461974400,,2827,4.366920152091255
183818,5,1562550888,"The extended version is superior for those who enjoy even a more nuanced description of Indian culture and characters. It is in my opinion one of the very finest films made, and in my mind the best made concerning the American west. The extra describing how the film was made ""accidently"" explains why it is such a great film. Kevin Costner was too young and inexperienced to know it couldn't be done! For example, when you think of it, it seems so impractical to film in the Lakota language, but that turned out to be the only way it could be filmed. The extended material is not inferior material and fits seamlessly into the new version. Thanks to those who worked on this 20th anniversary disc.",1461888000,,698,4.5476190476190474

I like how the movie showed the Native Americans as a group of people with a culture rather than ruthless savages.  Saw this as a kid and couldn't get into it but watching it over again now years later it was a good change.

The disc did play -  so I just decided to keep it.

I was pretty disappointed bc this DVD was not the Special edition as advertised, and also does not have any Special features . . . but the seller gave me about 3/4 of my money back - so,i guess it's all good.

I've bought about 75 DVDs in the last 18 months or so -  this was the first time I ever got one that was the wrong disc and had no cover art.
I guess I been pretty lucky.

Make sure when you get the disc it has the same picture as shown (Costner-horse-American flag) and is dated 2014 or 2015 - that will be the 25th Anniversary Edition. It will also have special features about the making of the movie.",1455148800,2,816,3.9390243902439024

It was a brave film for its depiction of the Sioux Indians and the ""white man"", although not the first film to do this.

Do not listen to any naysayers who have negatively reviewed this film, for they know naught of whence they speak. Visually, this is a most breathtaking presentation and overall, a masterful production.
I recommend this to everyone in almost any age group (with the exception of younger than 12 years of age - due to some graphic scenes of violence and some sensually presented scenes - nothing overwhelmingly sexual, but something reserved for 12 years or older).",1449705600,,775,4.923664122137405

exposed as well as the inhumane treatment of our Native American Brothers and sisters. The U.S. Government practically killed off
the many different Tribes which included innocent men, women and children. Do the research and you will find that the American Government
slaughtered millions and stole their lands which are considered ""Sacred"" like the Black Hills. All for the Rail Road, Gold and ""progress"" in which numerous Treaties which were signed by U.S. Presidents were violated by the Government.
This story is just a beginning to some really in depth research and a very good way to experience for yourself the ways of the Indian.

184035,5,1562550888,"I have had a few variations of ""Dances with Wolves"" come into and exit my collection.  My first was the original single tape VHS.  I remember it was the first VHS tape to hold a THREE HOUR film on one tape.  I sold all of my VHS tapes when I moved into DVD.  Big mistake, because there are still titles on VHS that are not available on DVD.  Go figure.  I bought Dances with Wolves on DVD with Dolby Digital sound.  Then I found a two disc DVD with a much superior DTS soundtrack!  Once it came out on blu ray I bought it. That is when I felt like a SUCKER.  They released on blu ray an ""Extended Cut"" of ""Dances"".  What a HUGE mistake.  The Theatrical Cut is the superior cut.  The Extended Cut is OVERLONG.  It drags on and on in certain scenes.  Also, it adds almost another hour to a movie that was almost perfect at three hours long.  The Theatrical Cut won BEST PICTURE for crying out loud!  Now that I have a region free blu ray player, this disc is what I needed.  A blu ray disc of the Theatrical Cut.  So why isn't this available in the US?  Who knows?  They are probably waiting for an anniversary edition to release this cut, which is tragic.  Everyone should be allowed to enjoy this film in High Definition with the Original Cut of the film.

It was super confusing at first because I thought I was watching a parody of the movie, then realized I wasn't. Maybe I'm just slow.  When we start hearing Mr. Dunbar reading his journal in such a monotone way, I thought I could not continue, but I did and eventually it did not bother me anymore.  The relationships that begin and grow are truly emotional as they show two completely different cultures accepting one another. I was surprised to learn the Kevin Costner not only stars in this but directed as well. The film was very well made and the music is amazing.

184182,4,1562550888,"DANCES WITH WOLVES was Kevin Costner's directorial debut, and what a debut it was. It's not just an epic in terms of length, but also in terms of the themes of love, adventure and cultural exchange which it addresses. It is a richly detailed portrayal of one man's enlightenment and transformation that should cut to the heart of anyone who watches it. Kevin Costner plays Lieutenant John J. Dunbar, wounded during the Civil War in Tennessee and, at his request, transferred to the frontier. When he arrives there, he finds his post deserted. While there, he eventually meets the Lakota Sioux and strikes up a friendship with them that develops over the course of the film. One thing (among many) that this film does right is portray Native Americans in a more sympathetic light compared to film portrayals in the past. Here they aren't ""noble savages,"" but people just living off the land who have a rich culture and history. The Pawnee aren't portrayed as kindly, but in the context of the film this is ok as they are enemies of the Sioux. This leads to the bigger issue of American imperialism and the Monroe Doctrine which, while never directly addressed as such, was a major source of tension between the US and Indian tribes in the 19th century. Yes, we stole land that they had been living on for generations and the film is bold enough to admit that. Aside from issues, DANCES WITH WOLVES manages to just tell a good story with richly detailed characters that has dramatic heft and palpable emotional impact. There are a number of sequences which display Costner's eye for good cinema and show a firm directorial hand at work. One such sequence takes place about halfway through and shows Dunbar and the Sioux hunting a herd of buffalo on the plain. There are also a few battle sequences which are brilliantly filmed. The only minor complaints I have are that the US soldiers towards the end are portrayed as villains in a somewhat cartoonish way. While certainly not saints, I feel like they were portrayed that way on purpose so as to make the Native Americans look that much more like the heroes. I can see why this was done, but I don't feel like it was entirely necessary to vilify them in such a broad way. I also think that despite the importance of the events that the film portrays, and the way in which it portrays them, that in the end it's merely a crowd-pleasing epic. Nothing truly profound is said about the human condition and our relationships with one another, as seems to be the film's intention. It has the slight air of being a cinematic apology: a rather sincere one, but still a little pretentious. I'm not quite sure if this film deserved to win Best Picture in 1991, as there were a lot of strong contenders that year, but it certainly was a high point for Kevin Costner's career and is definitely worth seeing.",1425600000,4,2844,4.622529644268774

184188,5,1562550888,"Dances With Wolves is an epic western, directed and starred by Kevin Costner. This is probably one of his greatest film roles. What I liked most of this was that the movie didn't try to portray Indians as they did in days past, as savages or red devils. This one showed the positive and human sides of their culture, showing them laughing, loving, and fighting for their lives.

LT Dunbar enters the story as a young officer in the Civil War. he was wounded and then to break a stalemate between the rebel and Yankee troops, he mounts a horse and rides back and forth in front of the rebel soldiers, drawing fire and expecting to die. He didn't. Instead, it encourages his men and they route the enemy. He is decorated for bravery and given his choice of commands. He wants to go west where they are fighting Indians. He arrives and his orders are cut by a major who is clearly insane. After he leaves, the major commits suicide, so no one at the fort knows he is going to a remote post in Sioux country. As he is half-way there, a demoralized troop of soldiers decide to abandon their post and leave. They never see Dunbar, and Dunbar arrives to find his post abandoned, and obviously by the looks of it, by a bunch of demoralized men.

So Dunbar decides to make himself at home, and prepare to defend his post, not knowing where the other soldiers went, or when anyone will come to join him. The Sioux find a white man with enough brass to live there alone a curious thing, even scary. They try unsuccessfully to steal his horse. After the failed attempt to steal his horse, fierce warrior ""Wind In His Hair"" comes back and shakes his spear at Dunbar, who is holding a gun on him. He screams with violent gestures and says three times, ""I am Wind in His Hair, can you not see I am not afraid of you?"" Then he rides off.

The Sioux have a council and the chief thinks this white man may be important, someone with whom treaties may be struck. He sends his two best men, Medicine Man ""Kicking Bird"", and his fiercest warrior, ""Wind In His Hair"" to make first contact with him, to talk. They do not understand one another, but Dunbar makes them a cup of coffee and they try to pantomime sign language. it is tedious at first but after several trips, they give him a buffalo robe as a gift.

Dunbar is invited to the Sioux camp, where Kicking Bird has arranged his adopted daughter, a white girl he save from the Pawnees, to translate. Though rough going at first, the white girl raised as a Sioux, known as ""Stands with a Fist,"" becomes the key to unlock Dunbar. Little by little he adopts their ways and falls in loves with Stands With A Fist.

Dunbar goes back and forth from his post to the Sioux camp, and while at his post, befriends a solitary wolf, half-starved and apparently abandoned by his pack. One day he is playing with the wolf, and Kicking Bird takes it as a sign and the Sioux name him ""Dances With Wolves."" Dunbar goes on a buffalo hunt with the tribe, which is an amazing a realistic shooting of a buffalo hunt. After he returns he takes Stands With a Fist as his wife. It is now time for the Sioux to go on a seasonal raid of their bitter enemies, the Pawnees camp. Dunbar is left behind because he doesn't know how to fight the ""Sioux way"" and left to take care of Kicking Bird's family. The Pawnees raid the Sioux camp and Dunbar digs up a cash of repeating rifles and leads old men, women and kids in an armed resistance to defend their homes and lives. When the Sioux return, Dunbar's status is elevated to not just a Sioux, but a leader and important Sioux.

Everything seems to be going fine until the Sioux start to move to their winter camp. Dunbar realizes that his journal at his post is a documented story of his collaborating with the enemy. He returns to retrieve the journal, and finds the post occupied and since he is dressed like and Indian, he has his horse shot out from under him and he is beaten and put in chains. Roughly treated, he refuses to speak with them except in Sioux. They send a detail to transport him to the next fort, where he will be tried and hanged. His Sioux friends intervene and save him. In the days that follow, in the Sioux winter camp, his heart grows heavy when he realizes that he is putting his new tribe in danger. The white men, he knows, will hate him as none other, and never quit coming. He elects to take his wife and leave, to keep the tribe safe. As Dunbar and wife leave, Wind In His Hair, now his closest friend, screams three times from a mountaintop, ""Dances With Wolves, I am Wind In His Hair. Can you not see that I am your friend? Can you not see that I will always be your friend?""

184236,5,1562550888,"There I said it. Now they'll never let me sit at the hipster table so we can talk about how Reservoir Dogs is a deconstruction of modern masculinity or some such. From JFK to Field of Dreams, I celebrate his entire catalog. I even like The Postman. To me he has something of old Hollywood in him.

But last night I re-watched Dances with Wolves and the only question I am left with is - how was Kevin not able to recapture the magic that brought together an average book by a nearly unknown writer and a first time director to make such a magnificent movie.

The first 40 minutes or so had so many strong character actors spouting such memorable dialog; Robert Pastorelli - ""Somebody back east is saying, 'now why don't he write"", Maury Chaykin - ""I've pissed myself. And there's nothing anybody can do about it!"" right before he blows his brains out. Frankly I almost wonder why the movie didn't take a darker, more bizarre turn. You really get this sense that John Dunbar has walked to the edge of the earth and is looking into the void.

Regardless, what follows from that point in the movie is equally magical. Naysayers will whine that Goodfellas deserved the Oscar for best picture. But Goodfellas (while a great movie) doesn't leave me inspired - and that (IMO) deserves recognition.

To say nothing of the score - John Barry's score (while it does drip with treacle) matches the mood of the film that somehow celebrates America while revealing our dark past.

I won't say more. You either like the film or loath it. But for me, it should be put in the vault and remembered with the greats. Thank you Kevin.",1422230400,2,1614,4.513698630136986

In the midst of the carnage, one White man (John Dunbar) shows great sensitivity and curiosity toward the Indians and winds up changed forever (for the better) by befriending them. A love story develops between him and a White woman adopted by the Sioux when she was a child. The photography is magnificent. The music is a touch sappy.

I could not see the translated words

only been my tv settings though.

At any rate, this is a good movie. I had it on VHS and when that device took a dive I decided not to replace it. I waivered back and forth for years about buying the DVD version and I'm glad I did. An epic with scenery such as this absolutely deserves Blu-ray. In fact, I came to appreciate the movie even more. It's the long version, so be prepared for that. It has a hilarious commentary by the DP and Editor too. In hindsight it's worth buying just for that.

184403,5,1562550888,"A stupendous, cinematic achievement of sheer epic proportions that will transport the viewing audience back to the simple prairie life when the White Man and the Native Indians could be true and best of friends, neighbors, family and travelling companions, despite the ridiculous social pressures of the day which dictated to the contrary. Dear Reader, please keep in mind if you would... that shamefully, it was the White Man who by way of hostile takeover, broken treaties, outright greed and brutal and often times inhumane subjugation, took the combined lands, known as: The United States and Canada... from the Native Indians. And not, the other way around. The Indians were then herded onto 'Indian Reservations' which the White Man... to ease his guilty conscience, supposedly 'afforded' the Indians. The White Man took the land and then thought that he was doing the Native Indians a favor by ""giving"" them a small section of their land to exist upon, as opposed too, live on. There is a big difference between the two. The Indians of various Tribes, were surrounded and closely monitored on these 'Reservations', to further ensure that they would ""keep their place."" And to make matters worse, it was the type of land that came with geographic hardships, such as: Not enough trees for wildlife hunting (food) or shade from the scorching sun, or streams and rivers to quench their thirst and wash their clothes. Or they were stuck in the desert and if they complained, the White Man was quick to give them 'moonshine' to squelch their unwarranted misery. Consequently, many sober Indians became acute alcoholics. Over all, they were ""given"" chunks of land that was considered an impoverished ghetto-type of area. And some cruel people, even today... call Indians, ""thieves?!"" And for all that - combined, they were supposed to be appreciative and truly grateful. Where all White Men like that? No. Of course not. But sadly, a majority of them were. And as history will attest, it was most definitely their land(s) long before, it became the White Man's. Embarrassing but true. And a grose, unwarranted, heinous injustice that was deliberately perpetrated against the Native Indian Nation. So, it is an absolute fact that regardless of the Tribe, Native Indians are the true 'Americans and Canadians', who were only... as would be expected, defending their territory when they came against the White Man. And as a Canadian-born, Caucasian woman who has the privilege of residing within the United States, I claim the 'Right of Free Speech' to tell the truth. This 2-disc, color, Extended Cut/Collectors Edition, DVD Set of DANCES WITH WOLVES, is an endearing story that is brilliantly depicted on the big-screen. It is a timeless epic, a true classic for every new generation. And having been nominated for numerous Oscars, this magnificent motion picture was appropriately the winner of 7 Academy Awards, including: Best Picture of 1990. The other six Oscars were for: Best Director (Kevin Costner); Best Adapted Screenplay: Best Sound; Best Editing; Best Score and Best Cinematography. The breathtaking open wilderness, prairie scenes are beautiful to behold. And the authentic costuming on the majestic Sioux Indians, especially on their Chief and Medicine Man are colorful, ornate and as befitting royalty and rank, regal. The setting is within the continental United States during the middle of the American Civil War (1861-1865), the year is 1863. And U.S. Army/Union Lieutenant - John J. Dunbar after a heroic act of bravery... was as a reward, is re-assigned to a Post out in the open, western frontier which he wanted to see, before it disappeared. His destination is Fort Sedwick which is located in the heart of Indian Territory. Loaded with two wagons full of provisions to re-supply the Fort, the good Lieutenant hitches a ride with his horse in tow, to his desired Post. Having arrived at Fort Sedwick, he finds it strangely deserted. And after unloading his abundant provisions, he parts company with his rather disgusting, ill-mannered, travelling companion. Alone and greatly puzzled as to why the Fort is utterly deserted and in shambles, he sets out to clean up the entire area with the assumption, that the rest of the Union Army Soldiers will return. With only his horse 'Cisco' and a curious wolf who he named 'Two Socks' as company, he made himself ready for any and all encounters. Meanwhile, he rode out and surveyed the land and made his notations. But in so doing, he was unaware that he too, was being observed. The Sioux Indian word for the English word - 'buffalo', is ...""kotanka."" And after several mishaps and false starts at getting acquainted, the word ""kotanka"" is instrumental and unique in that, it is the opening statement between the new neighbors: The lone Lieutenant - John J. Dunbar and the amused Sioux Indians. They think that he is nice and neighborly but a little on the nutty side, for his ice-breaking attempts at dialogue using his ""kotanka"" buffalo portrayal. Viewing his behavior, the Indians weren't quite sure what to make of him and politely and ever so calmly, remain seated on their horses at a safe distance  while the brave Medicine Man and a Indian Warrior, sit on the ground close to him and watch his entertaining, communication, theatrics. Unless provoked, the non-hostile Lieutenant, who was acutely aware that as ordered, the U.S. Army was going to overtake the Indians and seize their land, had peacefully achieved his objective. The most unlikely of neighbors were now 'officially' acquainted and more or less, properly introduced. And, the now established friendship between the Indians and the White Man, grows and they go on to experience much together. Especially since, they had to fight to retain it. Political and military clashes, lack, severity in the wilderness, near starvation and sheer hatred by others, were just some of the hurdles that opposed their friendship and camaraderie. This monumental achievement from MGM Pictures as presented by TIG Productions, is an action/adventure, drama that for 3-hours and 56-minutes will sweep you off of your feet in story and content depiction. It transports it's audience into another time and another place, in beautiful and breathtaking scope in classic 16 X 9 widescreen format. Actor and Academy Award winning Director - Kevin Costner, stars in his portrayal of Lt. John J. Dunbar within this extraordinary film. He courageously breaks a multitude of social, racial and political barriers within this superb presentation. So, if you want to watch a great movie as opposed to a good flick, this is the film to watch. So, go ahead and pop the popcorn, relax and enjoy. Because this Extended Cut, 2-disc, Collectors Edition, DVD Set that is nearly 4-hours long, is entertaining, engrossing and sure to please and a definite keeper for your epic DVD collection.

It also covers equal rights because even known it was very forbidden for people to become very friendly with someone or something that wasn't there exact kind John Dunbar becomes very close to indians he meets on his journey, and also with a wolf and a dog. The scenes with the clouds are done very well such as when John's guide on the journey Timmons leaves him, and it's very cloudy outside when he does because this shows that the path Timmons is going on is a cloudy one since he doesn't have company, and someone guiding him where to go if necessary the same goes for John who's now alone.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Leading man Kevin Costner made his directorial debut in 1990 with Dances with Wolves, the fictional tale of a despondent white man who regains his sense of purpose with a tribe of American Indians against the backdrop of the western frontier. The film was a hard sell: Westerns were not in vogue at the time, not to mention that Costner was insistent on keeping the running time at a potentially-lethal three hours as well as relying on the heavy use of subtitles. The roots of Dances with Wolves were seeded 8 years earlier, with Kevin Costner's first screen credit, a largely forgettable offering titled Stacy's Knights [1983]. The film's greatest contribution was the initial collaboration between Kevin Costner, the film's director, Jim Wilson, and the scriptwriter Michael Blake. In subsequent years, Jim Wilson and Kevin Costner would create a production company and make seven films together, including Dances with Wolves in the producer's seat.

Wounded on a Civil War battlefield, Lt. John Dunbar [Kevin Costner] watches as his own suicidal act results in unexpected heroism, leading to a promotion and a requested assignment on the Great Plains of America. Taking command of a dilapidated fort by himself, Dunbar rejuvenates his mind, taking to nature observation and journaling as a way of passing the time before reinforcements arrive. Visited by a tribe of Sioux Indians, led by Kicking Bird [Graham Greene], Dunbar is immediately drawn to this alien nation, intrigued by the peaceful curiosity exhibited by a people he's been trained to call the enemy. Through various offerings of trust and prairie insight, Dunbar soon becomes part of the community, falling for their adoptive Caucasian daughter, Stands with a Stands with a Fist [Mary McDonnell]. Making a life with the Native Americans, Dunbar, now rechristened Dances with Wolves, finds his rightful home, but worries for the safety of the Sioux as military forces encroach on the land.

Collecting numerous honours, omnipresent publicity, and gargantuan box office during its theatrical run, it's easy to forget the precarious position Dances with Wolves' was in before its release in 1990. Here was a three-hour motion picture working a wheezing genre, with a major chunk of its running time devoted to subtitles for the Lakota Sioux language spoken in the film. It was a picture of respect and revisionism in a time when Westerns weren't so culturally tolerant, driving into the great expanse of the West to explore the tentative bond between enemies. It was also a $17-million-dollar gamble for Kevin Costner, who pieced together the budget while developing a script written by his dear friend Michael Blake, which was adapted from his own novel, while also assuming intensive performance duties. And to make the project even more unattractive to outsiders, Kevin Costner elected to direct, making his feature debut. And boy did it ever. `Dances with Wolves' quickly ascended to cultural ubiquity, assuming sleeper command as audiences flocked to see a compassionate western starring a rare actor of affable all-American charisma. However, its raging success obscured a great deal of its artistry, with subsequent years turning the film into a punching bag for loutish OSCAR pundits and the understandably disillusioned anti-Kevin Costner crowd. A burning resentment that's unearned and unfair.

At the core of Dances with Wolves' lies a story heavy with vulnerability, taking an uncommon route of contemplation in a genre that typically revels in war. Blake's tale is one of spiritual breakthrough, as Lt. John Dunbar grows to find himself in the middle of nowhere, compelled to follow his heart while his head rattles with duty and doubt. It's a beautiful illustration of instinct as the lead character interacts and soon melds with the Sioux, finding a home with his adversary, only to discover there are little differences between the ""white man"" and the Native Americas. It's a note of tolerance that would crumble in many other hands, played either too syrupy or too abruptly. Kevin Costner allows his film to soak in the juices of discovery, encouraging the viewer to be lulled in by the majesty of the locations and the integrity of personal expression and a directorial blend of John Ford and David Lean, with a few Terrence Malick beats of naturalistic texture found along the way.

`Dances with Wolves' is never saccharine, never melodramatic; it's paced to embrace character catharsis while the narrative moseys along, intensifying Dunbar's odyssey. There's no doubt the rebirth is nurtured by Dean Semler's stunning prairie cinematography and it's a film to live inside of, not just watch passively, which treats blue skies and rolling pastures as scripture, but the central emotional bloom of the film is carefully encouraged throughout, creating this tractor beam of drama as Lt. John Dunbar is compelled to push his Sioux alliance further. The arc is hypnotic, not simply because of Kevin  Costner's deceptively straightforward ""aw, shucks"" performance, but in the deliberate pace of the story, which takes the time to appreciate the psychology shared between the diverse cultures, honouring stances of pride and threat, especially the Sioux who are hardly pipe-sucking pacifists, breathing in the pure magnificence of the pause as this sweeping drama plays out.

It's Kevin Costner's steady hand that makes a miracle out of Dances with Wolves.' It's cinematic integrity with timing and composure that could only emerge from a young, hungry filmmaker surrounded by a pack of supportive friends, remarkable collaborators, and a splendid ensemble offered an exquisite amount of screen time to feel out the unsettled nature of their characters. Extra attention must be paid to McDonnell, who creates a feral, wounded creature out of Stands with a Fist, refusing to wilt in the presence of picture's brightest star. The performance is a sustained surprise, taking intriguing linguistic turns while generating authentic heat with Kevin Costner and their extended dance of the pants. Graham Greene also hits several grace notes as the conflicted tribal leader, a man willing to trust Lt. John Dunbar, yet wise enough to understand the charge of settlers sure to follow him.

Of course, no discussion of `Dances with Wolves' would be complete without genuflecting in front of composer John Barry, who gifts the screen one of the great all-time film scores, soothingly enriching Dunbar's journey with romantic and adventurous themes that curl up around the picture, evoking cross-country movement and longing with a symphonic sanctuary that's emotionally crippling. It's aural splendour from a long-time industry deity.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The stunning 1080p encoded image is awesome and it has a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and is a revelatory experience, with Dances With Wolves' coming across as majestic as ever on this Blu-ray disc, providing a richly rewarding viewing experience unseen since its theatrical debut. Colours are of primary concern, with the presentation clinging tightly to the wondrous blue skies and outdoorsy particulars of the locations, supplying crisp hues that preserve the cinematographic intent, creating several astonishing moments of naturalistic intensity. Costumes and actors are heartily detailed, with textures easy to recognize and enjoy, greatly reinforcing the production effort and the tattered integrity of the era. Close-ups are ideally gritty and natural, displaying natural skin tones and intricate make-up work. Shadow detail buttresses the image superbly, pulling pure detail out of low-light scenarios, supplying a richer read of frame information with moderate softness. The viewing event is crisp and evocative, allowing the film some home entertainment glory.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD Master Audio sound mix is an invigorating aural experience that assists the film's mood and dramatic hold with a wide range of elements, smoothly blended into a cinematic event. Perhaps most important here is the score, which retains such elegant, persuasive life on the track, sweeping across the mix when called upon, or keeping a respectful distance during more private encounters. The music is a key element of the feature, keeping in perfect step with the images. Atmospherics are just as critical, with beautiful, lush elements of environmental changes keeping the surrounds alive with energy, nicely balanced with the frontal dialogue exchanges. Action beats are intense without overkill, feeling out interesting directional activity with arrows and bullets. Low-end is lovely, becoming something truly remarkable during the buffalo hunt centrepiece sequence, with the creatures rumbling along, creating a gorgeous sensation of weight and power to best underscore the enormity of the moment.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: Sadly there are extras with this Blu-ray disc. Surely Warner Home Movies must have lots of behind-the-scenes extras and interviewing the all the people involved with the film.

Finally, Time has softened the impact of Dances with Wolves' and sugar-coated many of its grim realities and the film's detractors tend to forget the picture's eye-opening body count, yet the feature retains extraordinary intelligence and care, earnestly investigating the ties that bind and the prejudices that divide. It's a tale of immense pastoral presence and intimacy, an irresistible serving of consciousness in the heartland. Kevin Costner might have lost his way during his career as his ego inflated and monetary concerns were, but Dances with Wolves' is as genuine an artistic triumph as they come; a spellbinding American classic that tastes the tears of a country in the midst of all its incomparable beauty. Despite the pitiful woeful exclusion of Extras, which makes me very angry, but I am still honoured to have this classic Western Opera in my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

The story is a solid one, but please, at 236 minutes watching this becomes an uncomfortable endurance contest. This film should and could have been cut down to 120 minutes and been just fine.

We see what happens when a culture of short sightedness and greed clashes with the culture of the original inhabitants of North America.

They teach him words like ""Tonka Truck"" (which means, ""Buffalo Truck""), and even give him the name...*spoiler alert*...""Kevin Costner, Dances with Wolves.""

I watched this movie in parts, mostly the parts where Kevin was home alone. I recommend this movie to fans of fields and animals. And if you DO imagine that Kevin Costner is a Highlander and is, therefore, immortal, having this as the second movie in the trilogy makes it even more worth watching.

Fascinating realistic look at how people lived in that age. This is a story that should not go unheard by current generations.  Rather than history class in high school - show them this movie!

184481,5,1562550888,"Just some quick thoughts on this classic...

There really isn't much more to say about this movie that hasn't already been said.  Dances With Wolves (1990) won 7 Academy Awards, including Best Picture.  This is an epic western with great acting, cinematography, musical score...really everything is top-notch.  Kevin Costner stars as a Civil War soldier who becomes friends with a tribe of Sioux Indians.  That's all I want to say.  Watch the movie to see how everything unfolds.  This movie also stars Mary McDonnell, Graham Greene, and Rodney A. Grant.

This is one of those moving, epic movies that will stay with you long after you see it.  The musical score by John Barry is outstanding and won him an Academy Award for Best Original Score.  The South Dakota and Wyoming scenery throughout the movie is awesome.

Dances With Wolves comes highly recommended.",1398902400,,862,4.958041958041958

184484,5,1562550888,"I saw the theatrical cut of this American classic last year, and I finished watching the Extended Cut a few hours ago. I haven't had time to view the special features yet, though.

The theatrical cut of this movie is nothing less than a masterpiece. Very well written & directed, with meticulous attention to detail, and beautifully photographed. The panoramic views of the sunsets are reminiscent of David Lean's work in Lawrence Of Arabia, and the music just as lovely, if not more so. The irony here is that while the main theme in Lawrence is romantic, there's no love interest. But I digress.

The Extended Cut of Dances With Wolves adds more to an already perfect masterpiece. To quote from Blade Runner-Director's Cut: 'It's a great movie made even greater.' For instance, the unnamed Major (Maury Chaykin) in the theatrical cut is referred to by name in the Extended Cut. There are more scenes of minor and major importance not in the theatrical cut that are in the Extended Cut, but I saw the theatrical cut around August last year, so I really can't remember the specific details of every scene included in the Extended Cut which was not in the theatrical cut. Besides, even if I did remember, to say anymore would be like ruining the surprise.

The only fly in the ointment for me was the profaning of God's Name (ie. combining God's Name with a mild profanity). I know soldiers spoke like that, but it wasn't common, as President Lincoln would reprimand any soldier who used such opproborious language.

See both versions, and then decide for yourself which one you like best.

The movie is more developed with the extra footage. For example it was unclear in the short version what happened to the hide hunters that slaughtered the buffalo and left the carcasses to rot. In the long version it was plain that the Sioux caught them and dealt prairie justice. Also the romance between Stands with Fist and Dances with Wolves was expanded. For example there was the scene in which a dowery was made to Kicking Bird for her hand. There are also breathtaking scenes shot in the Black Hills.

The vast views of the prairie, mostly shot early in the morning or in the evening bring out the beauty of the landscape.  Combining John Barry's extraordinary musical score with the visual, and again, this is a 5-star movie.  Unfortunately, the musical score and scenic vistas cannot carry the entire movie.  Frankly, I thought the  movie was too long; tighter editing would have made this an all-round 5-star movie.  At over 3 hours long, this movie could have been cut significantly and made it a compelling and moving story.  Unfortunately, I found myself wanting to fast-forward through the lengthy takes with little or no dialogue just to move the film along to its conclusion.

Excellent movie, just too long.

The story is very slow-moving, and the characters are all stereotypes.  The Sioux are the ""good"" Indians, the Pawnee, enemies of the Sioux, are the ""evil"" Indians, and the US military (except for the protagonist Lt. Dunbar) are such total buffoons they make the Keystone Kops look like models of professionalism.  The story itself is full of improbabilities too.  A white woman kidnapped by the Pawnee as a child (and later retrieved by the Sioux) is suddenly able to speak English to Lt. Dunbar, and when Dunbar returns to his fellow soldiers, they shoot his horse and after dozens of shots, kill Dunbar's pet wolf, who stayed around and let the bullets fly at him.  (Like even incompetent soldiers would waste valuable ammunition killing animals for no reason.  Sheesh.)

It should be noted that none other than MAD Magazine wrote a parody cartoon of this movie, in which it compared ""Dances With Wolves"" with other current movies-the major comparison being that none of them were an honest depiction of the American Indian.

184505,4,1562550888,"I like the visual quality of this Bu-ray transfer of the movie and I love the theatrical cut of the film. While it is nice to see some of the things that were left on the cutting room floor, sometimes there is a reason. I would like to see the theatrical cut with all these deleted scenes as a special feature or have both versions available instead of just one.

Please understand my review as from the perspective of someone who regularly watched slow art house movies, dramas, and really all movies romantic comedies. I tend to watch 2 new movies a week (not including the box office fodder).

This is the Extended version and most of the extra 55 minutes of footage is of John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) narrating fluffy pointless lines over boring scenes, or extraneous scenes of Indians (a period term) riding and tracking (which would be interesting as a separate bit of footage), or of soldiers being jerks.

If you can't  get or don't want the theatrical version on Blu-ray this will still have everything you are looking for, maybe just a little more than too. Or you can just stream it from Amazon or Netflix.",1394496000,5,1116,4.565

184513,5,1562550888,"First, I am Swedish, so please excuse my faltering English.

This ""film"", no, experience of a life time is something none other have ever come close to, in my opinion. It works on so many different levels that it's almost incomprehensible to understand fully from the beginning. One has to see it again and again to really grasp the greatness of it. It goes from decribing the senselessness of war (the Civil War), through people being stranded out in small representations of ""civilization"" such as the small forts on the prairie, and going nuts by the experience. Then, it compares the values of this ""civilization"" to the indian culture living in symbiotic existence with nature and wild life. And it actually succeeds, without being overly cheesy or overbearing, atleast not in my view. It's only fault (which is no small one) is describing the two indian cultures present as 'the good' (Sioux) and 'the bad' (Pawnee), a too black and white view for me.

I saw this in the movies when the original version was shown in the nineties here in Sweden, and it stuck from the outset. Then came the extended version with an explanation of why the poeple at the fort(s) went crazy. For me, there is no such thing as a too long film, when it is this good. It could've been 12 hrs long and I would've gladly watched it, in portions mind you.

This is the only film I gave a ten on IMDB. It's that good. Acting, scenery, photography, story. This film is an epic in every sense of the word. It actually heals my mind when I get depressed by modern life idiocy. Thank you. /Erik Brickman.",1393891200,,1579,4.552816901408451

184577,2,1562550888,"The sentimentality that this film oozes is just too much to bear at times. Apparently the American public, who is accustomed to such trifling immodesty, swallowed this up when it was first released and hailed Costner as the ""new genius of American art films"".

Well, since then we've learned two things, that first of all, this film is another foray into the ""John Wayne"" bias of American dogmatism and secondly Costner is a ham who hasn't scored another big hit in years. The film gives us the once again undefiled view of an idealist who was born in the wrong ethic group. Costner plays a Union troop in the Civil War that is merely a ""misunderstood"" progeny and suffers physically and spiritually as a result of it. He gets a new command and like a dim witted simpleton he picks the one that is the furthest from civilization. He soon learns that solitude is not an easy thing. One day he encounters a group of Indians in one of the most ridiculous scenes I have ever seen put forth to a group of adults. The film goes down hill from there and fast. One unrealistic example is when he shows his new Indian friends some ground coffee and they react like dumb founded buffoons, it was a fact in history that the Native Americans ground corn, and other seeds so they would in no way be surprised like this exaggerated claim. Why render them childish?

Costner then becomes a part of the tribe, merely walking into it like a new found brother. He learns the dialect, and sits with the chief while exuding pensive thought. Of course, instead of falling in love with an Indian woman, he falls in love with a captured white who mumbles her way through like a drought minded wench. How convenient that the evil Sioux captured an English speaking woman who is both beautiful and robust! Instead of portraying the Indians in a truthful manner, Costner singlehandedly misinterprets their culture as something bordering on vanity and he does so by extinguishing their intelligence and ability to live in harmony with nature.

Also, the scenes that dealt with the Pawnee were merely used for action sequences and in no way understood the vital role that other tribes had in relation to each other. The only decent portrait is of the stupidity and narrowness of the virulent white people who were shooting at everyone and everything.

Kevin Costner has always been a fave of mine (Field of Dreams, The Bodyguard, JFK, et cetera) with his laid back dialog delivery, southern accents, and making me believe the characters he was portraying. If you like scenic cinematography, this one's got it. If you like heartfelt dialog, this one's got it. If you want a good movie that will entertain you and make you think about the plight of the American Indians, this one's definitely got it. There is suspense, laughter, tears and cheers - everything you could ever want from a movie.

184597,5,1562550888,"What Kevin Costner did with this movie was make an honorable and honest attempt to portray the book's story of one white man found, and how he lived, with a nearby Sioux tribe.
The actors, in many cases, are extrordinary.  This film makes me weep with sadness for the Native American people who were so cruelly dealt with by so many of the early white settlers and the army of the time.  There was no attempt at concilation, no attempt to treat the Sioux (or any other Tribe) with even a small effort to understand their ways or their people.

Yes, we ""all know this"" and I may seem to be redundant; however, the way Costner tried, so obviously, to honor the memory of these people is heartwarming.  The 'bringing to life' of a story based on a book is often unsuccessful but I think he did the very best he could, and put his heart, as well as his own money and extensive time, into telling this tale.

I had not seen this movie in many years, but am not at sorry that I watched it again.  The relationships were real, and they touched me...

When he found the empty Fort Sedgwick, you were as puzzled as he was. But in this version, you know before he does so there is no mystery.  When we meet a bleeding Stands with a Fist in the original, she is also a mystery to Dunbar, but here we know about her before Dubar does. This version just takes the wonder out of the story.

Compared to most modern-day American movies I would give this four stars: but overall, three seem appropriate.  Kevin Costner's voice-over was... horrible.  When it first came out, critics criticised ""Avatar"" for being a typical hero-dream of a white man coming in to save the natives: I think Avatar did a far better, more tasteful job of it and gave the 'natives' more self respect and dignity.  It was an enjoyable journey, but really- what it needed was a different lead than Kevin Costner, whose stiff narration and poor acting ability really threw the movie off.  It felt like a millionare had paid off someone so they could star in a movie, and everyone around them constantly reminds you how horrible an actor they are.  Ironically, Costner directed it.

However, Dances with Wolves was a pleasant surprise that left me feeling satisfied with the experience.

So what makes this movie so interesting? Well, let's just get the bad stuff out of the way first. This movie is a very slow burn and I'm pretty sure I fell asleep for about 7-10 minutes or so, mainly when he's on his way to the new fort. Thankfully this wasn't integral to the plot, so having dozed off for a little bit didn't ruin the experience.

You have to watch this movie when you have free time and no distractions. The 3 hours is a daunting challenge, but trust me, it's well worth it. (Even if you take a nap at the beginning.)

On to the good!

Unlike most movies as of late. There's no 2-5 minute shot where you're just sitting there watching nothing. Something is always happening and all the characters have agency. Whether it's as simple as wanting to die, going to see the frontier, or trading goods, each character wants and tries to get something.

Standard scene stuff right? Wrong.

You see, you don't realize it earlier on, but the movie is secretly manipulating you with these little gestures. You see Kevin Costner's character Lt. Dunbar meet the native Americans for the first time and wonder how the heck are these guys going to communicate?

They don't, they don't for a long time. He mimes animals to try to translate and the natives try to understand him as well. It is through this innocent exchange of learning to communicate and sharing in a cup of coffee that you start to... like these people. The film very gently tugs on your heart strings and let's you grow to enjoy the characters. You develop an appreciate for the Sioux culture which is all about family, survival, and taking pleasure in the simple things in life.

You star to understand how Dunbar feels, because he is played in such a neutral fashion, that you can easily see yourself as a visitor to the Sioux village. Then, when you see Dunbar actively learn how to communicate in their language and become fully accepted into his people, the movie throws a curveball at you.

The United States Army shows up. The good guys right? Well, turns out you love the native Americans much more than the U.S. Army.

There were several heart breaking scenes that, if you're an animal lover, might be hard to watch. You're not going to be kept on the edge of your seat nor are you going to left with some ambiguous ending that you have to figure out for yourself.

Dances with Wolves will get you in touch with your inner humanity and make you appreciate a time where your life hasn't been consumed by electronic devices.

Kevin Costner as an actor was very convincing in his bewildered state of mind when he took on the task as being the lone soldier ""protecting"" an area that is occupied by Indians.  However, it is Kevin Costner the director that does an amazing job of using wide lens cameras in capturing the beauty of that hostile land.

184672,5,1562550888,"""Dances With Wolves"" is not only the story of a particular person but a story of one of the more bitter times in our history.  A magnificently done story of man's inhumanity to man and our complete misunderstanding of Native Americans which led to unnecessary bloodshed.  I am aware that all Native Americans were not peaceful, loving people until we came along.  That just isn't true.  They warred among themselves, took slaves, practiced cruelty.  But don't we do the same among ourselves?  No person or body of people are perfect but they didn't destroy themselves or the land with which they lived in harmony; we pretty much did that.  The Native Americans were decimated by diseases we brought with us because they had no built in immunity to as we did, by our desire for land and gold doing whatever it took to get what we wanted, the treaties Indians took seriously but were constantly broken by us because we discovered that we ""needed"" the land they had been given (even though it was mostly poor land).  Their main food sources were destroyed by self-serving uncaring people to whom money meant more than common decency.  Many on both sides were patently vicious and the majority won, didn't we?  History shows the half-truth that ""might is right"": those that had the power and the numbers inevitably took from those with lesser or  power and smaller numbers.  It's always been the way of humankind - not admirable but the way of the world from its beginning.  Sometimes good can come from bad; the United States being one of them.  With all its faults past and present it is still the best that the world has to offer.  But for that to happen the American Indian had to suffer and die.  Do we make amends?  Impossible.  Nobody and no amount of money can amend the destruction and humility that has weighed down the hundreds of tribes of American Indians - a great loss for humanity.  What we can do is recognize what has happened in the past and work together to keep it from happening again.  We should live up to our glorious Declaration of Independence and Constitution and abide by its precepts - in particular ""all men are created equal"" not some, but all of us.  It doesn't guarantee an equal outcome but acknowledges that we are all born with some innate quality that can make each of us special in our own way.  We all could become more special by living those lofty words of our precious documents by treating everyone from a person to a whole people with the respect for their specialness that has been so sadly lacking in the past.  This film might just give you the impetus to do so.",1386374400,,2606,4.5809935205183585

I watched the movie (loved the soundtrack also), in the sense that there are some men who could embrace the lifestyle and live among them without trying to be superior over the Native American.

184726,5,1562550888,"By the late 1980s, Kevin Costner had developed a decent reputation as an actor, having appeared in several fine movies, along with more than a few duds. But nothing he did before would have presaged his extraordinary effort as a director in Dances with Wolves, a superior epic western. Based on the novel by Michael Blake - who also wrote the screenplay - Costner stars as Lieutenant John Dunbar, a Civil War veteran who volunteers for a post in a remote part of the West, so he can see it ""before it's gone."" Reaching his destination, Dunbar finds it inexplicably deserted, and so he resolves to hold the fort, literally, until replacements arrive. Soon he is tormented but then befriended by a tribe of Lakota Sioux, who eventually adopt him as one of their own. Among them, he meets the love of his life, a white woman the Sioux have named Stands with a Fist (Mary McDonnell), who also had been adopted by the tribe as a child. The movie is distinguished by having all of its Native American roles played by Native Americans, and Graham Greene (as Kicking Bird), Rodney Grant (as Wind in his Hair) and Floyd Red Crow Westerman (as Chief Ten Bears) are particularly memorable, as is Wes Studi as a menacing member of the Pawnee tribe. Alternately joyous and terrifying, as with so many other great epics it's an ultimately heartbreaking story. One of John Barry's most memorable scores intensifies the mood - it's every bit as stirring as his music for Out of Africa.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1378425600,3,1720,5.327205882352941

184757,5,1562550888,"I first saw this movie as a teenager in high school and fell in love with not only the story line, but the soundtrack as well. The basic story is timeless and could be placed on nearly any era throughout history. The idea that history is written by the ""winner"" is brought out very clearly as this movie strives to contrast the traditional ""cowboys and Indians"" perception as portrayed in many history books and Hollywood productions since the 40's.

Beyond Costner's attempt to educate his audience on the plight of the Native American and the injustices committed by the Whites, he is able to bring out the stark lesson that people of all cultures have value and that sometimes one really needs to walk a mile in another's shoes to understand them.

It is regrettable that his production couldn't have been longer. Many if the lessons that he wanted to bring out were only vaguely touched upon in the screenplay. Had more liberty been given with the length, many of those could have been more fully developed. As it stands, the careful viewer will be able to enjoy this five star movie as it does well to communicate with the time it has, most of what Costner intended. Rivaled only by ""Field of Dreams"", this is clearly Costner's masterpiece in film, both in production and in acting.",1374105600,,1287,4.665198237885463

The scenery in BR combined with John Barry's GREAT score make for a perfect film.

It's characters were fabulous, it's story believable and beautiful, could find no fault with this film. And, the music score by John Barry is the best i've ever heard.

Every American should see this film, it captures so adroitly the beauty of the indigenous tribes and their old horse culture, and the wretched wrongs committed against them.

I think it would be better if they could modify the sytsem to make allowance for that. Anyway, this film is pretty good but it's kind of hard to take at first - particularly the first half of the movie. There's still a bit too much of the old cowboy mentality thrown in to how the producers depicted the traditional people of the land. That was probably what disappointed me the most about this movie, contrary to my idealized expectations about how portayals were going to pan out. Some very touching moments made up for this though, particularly when you see how beautifully Dunbar, (the main character) relates to a wild doggy who comes to give him some company during his lonlier moments at the fort. This is the wolf that becomes instrumental in helping the story-line evolve. However, my heart sank when this beautiful dog had a very tragic ending at the hands of merciless soldiers. That scene where the soldiers later come to the fort where Dunbar was originally stationed has got to be one of the most infuriating moments in the whole film. The injustice of it all - how they are so harsh in their judgement  and in their glamourized perception of their own superiority vis-a-vis the traditional inhabitants of the area. This really irked me inside-out. Other moments not to be missed in this film are the buffalo scenes - again first-off you get to witness how heartless the soldiers are towards the buffalo, how disresepctful and wasteful about life they are - in a not-too dissimilar fashion to how at the beginning of the movie Amazing Grace these like-minded people are to a horse that was injured. How the ""sense of humanity"" within the hearts of people becomes dimmed and distorted is a constant dilemma facing the human race. The amazing sight to watch when the buffalo herds return after some time of being seriously diminnished to absent altogther is something which really makes one come to understand the enormity and beauty of life and how precious and wonderful it really is.",1366761600,5,2123,4.6916890080428955

184899,5,1562550888,"""Dances With Wolves"" is touching and well made, but at times it seems as if it's trying just a little too hard to exist. It has makings of a classic: full of drama and passion, understanding and communication, and violence and power, but perhaps they are emphasized a little too much.

Kevin Costner directed, produced, and stars in this epic tale about John Dunbar, a Union lieutenant during the Civil War, who heads west to mark a post for pioneers and soldiers. He encounters some Sioux Indians who are portrayed rather savagely at first. We fear them and almost hate them as much as Dunbar. Can they make peace?

Much of the story revolves around the Indian tribe as we learn they are just as afraid of the white man as he is of them. Dunbar makes his first real gesture for peace when he encounters an injured Indian woman and gives her medical attention. When he brings her back to her tribe, they are not thankful, instead they scare him away. Eventually, the two sides work together and communicate. Both Dunbar and Sioux wonder where all the Buffalo have gone, and this gives them their first conflict to solve together.

Little happens in terms of plot and individual events. There isn't much dialogue because the two people cannot speak the same language. However, the body language and other forms of symbolic communication they use makes the story interesting. The characters show their emotions through their actions, they work together, hunt together and at least try to communicate with one another.

But a film cannot depend on indirect communication, so a translator (and a lover) is provided. Mary McDonnell co-stars as Stands With A Fist, a white woman who has lived with the Sioux since she was a child. It is obvious she and Dunbar will fall in love, but it does not seem as cliche it sounds. Because we are experiencing a new culture here, the concept of love is different from what we are used to. This originality and sense of character is what makes the film so great and touching. At first we feared the Sioux, now they are our friends and our family.

I didn't like the third act that much, but it's the entire point of the film. When Dunbar goes back to his cabin he is no longer John Dunbar, he is Dances With Wolves, and when the newly arrived Northern Army sees him, they mistake him for an Indian. These are the people we and Dunbar started out with, and now we see them in a completely different manner. The story almost becomes an adventure as we hope Dunbar will escape. It's exciting to watch, but it does seem a bit much.

Despite a few flaws, ""Dances With Wolves"" is excellent for what it is. But it does have a vivid theme about maturity, tolerance, and war and peace.",1360022400,2,2708,4.561728395061729
184900,5,1562550888,"Kevin Costner as Lieutenant Dunbar was superb in this movie along with Graham Greene as Kicking Bird & LOVED Rodney Grant as Wind in His Hair who almost didn't get the part, him I'll never forget.

There's also a region-free import version of this Blu-Ray which does have the theatrical cut, but it costs twice as much and doesn't look like it has any of the special features this 2-disc version has.  I'm guessing the video and audio quality aren't as good on the import, either (well, for one thing I know it has only Dolby TrueHD, which is good, but not as good as DTS 7.1 HD Master Audio, which this 2-disc set has).

184952,5,1562550888,"If you haven't seen this beautiful movie yet -- or if you have! -- do invest a little extra viewing time in the expanded 236-minute edition.  I originally saw it in a theater when it was first released, and liked it well enough, but the additional footage gives the film an extra dimension.

One of the criticisms of the original version was that other than the main character the white people in the movie were disproportionately bigoted, brutal and ignorant.  There was some validity to this, although the soldiers and doctors in the opening battle scene certainly weren't portrayed unsympathetically and the plot included a group of ""bad guy"" Native Americans.  However, the additional scenes in the expanded version do provide a wider range of white characters including the soldiers who vacate the fort.

Anyone expecting to see a POV of the 19th century western expansion period that you see in older Westerns will be disappointed, however.  Historically both movies and TV have considerably sanitized that entire era and presented it as the victors wanted it seen.  As much as many us may still love movies like ""The Searchers"" or ""High Noon"", the fact remains that mid-19th century Americans (and the colonial Europeans as well for that matter) were grossly racist by even conservative modern standards and remained ignorant of native culture for more than two centuries after the excuse of culture shock had expired.  Native Americans had basically committed the same 'sin' as the Canaanites in the Old Testament: they had land an invading group wanted and so had to be demonized as ""dirty, godless savages.""

One also is forced to step back and analyze how one sees other cultures, too often we are critical, and fail to see their beauty.

184971,5,1562550888,"I remember when ""Dances With Wolves"" first came out and everybody was talking about how good it was. I went to see it. The movie was just an instant classic. Outstanding! And it picked up a bunch of Academy Awards including best picture of 1990. Well, it earned them. Now I found the movie on the Wal-Mart $5 DVD rack. Well, now that's a bargain. I re-watched it last night and greatly enjoyed it the second time.

The story involves Kevin Costner, a Union soldier, who is assigned duty at a remote outpost near the edge of the Sioux Nation in the area of southern South Dakota. He was all alone. The story tells of him cleaning up the fort and getting it ready for more soldiers. Meanwhile, the Sioux  become aware of him. Very gradually, they forge a friendship which gradually grows until he is almost part of the tribe. It's a wonderful, very human story. Quite touching, and funny.

It was an excellent movie. Just outstanding. I enjoyed watching it again these 22 years later and I was overwhelmed once again. Great cinema. Movies this good don't come along very often. The photography was excellent and really captured the scenery of Badlands National Park and the contiguous area of the South Dakota Great Plains. The acting was excellent. The Sioux, in particular, really came across as genuine people and Kevin Costner as a very likable chap. The story had a nice flow to it. Well done. Definitely five stars!

(To be clear, I give the film five stars.  The product page?  One.)  There seem to be multiple versions of this film being released, but absolutely no clarification about what version we're buying.

Look at the Instant Video page and then this page.  There is nothing to explain any differences between them except that this one is 236 minutes and that one is 182.  That's almost an hour difference.  Some may not care which version they're buying, but I do.

That sort of thing seems to me like a half-hearted effort to squeeze a few bucks out of an old property and shows little respect towards your film or your customers.

I have not complained to Amazon as the fault is mine.  The disc it clearly labelled Region A on the Amazon site and Amazon are good enough to list discs as multi-region if appropriate - sometimes.  However, I took a chance because some of their multi-region discs are labelled Region A.  For example, another old western, 'The Big Country' is labelled Region A but I bought it from Amazon.com a while ago and I can play it fine.  And since a lot of older films are multi-region I took a chance.

184984,5,1562550888,"With the possible exception of Little Big Man, this film brings to life the uniqueness of an indian culture - the Sioux - with a sensitivity and intelligence that is without equal.  Not only that, but the film aged extremely well and did not in the slightest feel outdated.  Given the quirkiness of the Kostner character, who is not by any means some kind of noble hero, and absolutely first-rate acting, and you have a masterpiece.

The films starts during the Civil War, when an injured Kostner makes a gesture of despair and hope, to gain access to the officers' surgeon to save his wounded leg.  Offered whatever assignment he desires, he chooses the frontier, to witness it before it disappears.  So starts a journey in which he joins a Sioux tribe  and achieves the status of warrior.  It is a success that I have not found in any other cinematic experience - utterly convincing, painfully intimate, full of mistakes, and ultimately sad.  It is a spiritual journey to find his true identity and completely believable, even with the ambiguity of the ending.  I believe it is Kostner's best work.

As he gets to know the tribe, the individual personalities emerge with wonderful clarity, but it is the portrait of the tribe as a whole, the culture, that was by far the most beautiful for me.  There is grace, love, camaraderie, the sacred, and brutality all rolled into one.  Little Big Man did the same for the Cheyenne, but there was always an element of parody and tall tale to the film that I felt was aimed at children.  This film is adult, with realistically awful violence next to the beauty.  Indeed, it has inspired me to research Sioux culture more deeply.

My only criticisms include how crude the white interlopers appear.  It makes you cheer when they are killed, though there is a good captain.  Also, when becoming part of the tribe, Kostner supplies them with guns to fight another tribe, which I think is a profound violation of his duty as an army officer.  Finally, the bit with the wolf is stretched to the point of the truly maudlin.

Warmly recommended.  My wife and I had seen this shortly after she moved with me to the US, so it was an introduction to American history for her, a European.  Now, we watched it with our kids (in our European home) and they were utterly absorbed by it and full of questions, to the point that they will want to learn more.

184995,5,1562550888,"Dances With Wolves is Kevin Costner's finest film to date, hands down.  Nothing else comes close.  While the actual story is a tad revisionistic, it is very entertaining.  But before I get into this blu-ray release, I want to address an issue that I am surprised most critics did not catch onto.  Dances With Wolves is the movie that James Cameron adapted to do Avatar.  They are essentially the same stories, with the same character arcs and overall themes.  I won't go blow for blow, but watch them back to back and tell me that Avatar is not a rip-off of Dances With Wolves.  Now, this is not a review to bash Avatar, because I actually liked it.  But I am surprised how much praise Cameron gets for the movie without acknowledging how much it owes to Dances With Wolves.  Maybe he DID rip off Terminator from Harlon Ellison after all.

Anyway, I am usually not a big fan of extended cuts recently, because they tend to tack on a couple of minutes of crappy outtakes that were edited out for a reason.  Not so with Dances With Wolves.  One of the biggest revelations of this cut is you find out what happened to the soldiers of Fort Sedgwick before Lt. Dunbar made it there.  While the original theatrical cut works with an odd sense of mystery at the beginning, this is also an interesting addition adding an unnecessary, but fun cut that solves the mystery.  The other big addition for me was the soliloquey that Dunbar makes in his journal after they find the slaughtered buffalo.  He makes a mention that he could not sleep with them and there were no looks of blame.  That never sat well with me until I saw this extended version which puts that scene into context.  It turns out the scouts found the white guys who killed the buffalo, scalped and slaughtered them, and the dance you saw around the campfire was celebrating that.  It was, to me, a very important piece of the puzzle and I finally understood what Costner meant in that scene.  It is also a pivotal moment in Dunbar's development as he becomes separated from the Whahchichoo and becomes a different individual to the tribe and to himself.  He is becoming a man who does not fit anywhere.  This is a very key moment that, with this small addition in the film, makes the movie so much deeper and Dunbar's character arc much more compelling and real.

This is one of the few movies that used their cut scenes to great effect, similar to the extended cuts of the Lord of the Rings.  They are great for superfans, but also great for the regular viewer.  Yes, most of the cuts were obviously cut out for a reason, and for the most part, are unnecessary to the core story.  But if you like the story as much as I do, there are so many more delightful details to experience.",1326326400,37,2739,4.440881763527054
184996,5,1562550888,"Kevin Costner gets a lot of grief for Dances with Wolves, and while I agree with some of it, I think he did an exceptional job of trying to get this right. He employed numerous native Americans, asked for their advice regularly, and used their native language in the film. It's easy to forget now that, at the time, most movies about native Americans involved those individuals waving at tomahawk around and promptly dying. Dancing with Wolves was one of the first movies to really show the native American side of things, to help watchers get a sense of appreciation for their culture.

Lieutenant Dunbar - Costner - has had enough of war. He tries to commit suicide, fails, and volunteers to go out to the far west. Here he's assigned a run down, empty fort to guard. Soon he's becoming friends with the local tribe, and he quickly becomes restored by their down to earth style of living. There is a white woman as part of the tribe, and the two fall in love.

Yes there are the ""oh so good"" Sioux and the ""oh so evil"" Pawnee. There's only so much a movie can do to cross hurdles. We at least still have a native American group we are rooting for - and at times we're rooting against the ""evil Army"" which is fairly unheard of in movies back then.

I've ended up watching this at least 20 times. First, I write books on courtship practices and one is on the Native American practices. Since this movie was fairly well researched, I included it on my movie listings. Second, a college course I took had us watch this movie and examine the cultural interactions. The professor was convinced that the enemy tribe was NOT Pawnee so I had to watch it several times including the various director cuts to get the proof that they were in fact clearly referred to as Pawnee. The professor was also convinced that the teen boy, Smiles a Lot, was a homosexual. To me he was simply a boy trying to prove himself repeatedly to the men in the tribe, and over time he does earn their respect. I don't see any sign that he is considered a homosexual or anything other than a warrior-in-training by the tribe.

In terms of the Bechdel test, there are only two females of note in the storyline. One is the Caucasian woman, Stands with a Fist. The other is Black Shawl, the wife of the medicine man of the tribe. Both are good characters, but I'm not sure they ever talk with each other about anything other than Dunbar.",1324512000,,2404,4.4198645598194135
184997,5,1562550888,"Odd that the theatrical version I have does have DTS audio but the extended version I bought after does not.  The extended version is a must whether on blu ray or not as it fills in the many gaps in the plot line that were left unexplored in the original release.  Never the less, the real reason I am taking the opportunity to write this is:
1) Reviews of Standard Definition and Blu Ray releases should most definitely be separated by Amazon.
2) For those readers and writers of any movie reviews, I do not understand why the majority feel the need to summarize the story.  Most everyone knows the story already; this is not time for a book report.  The reviews that are helpful are the ones that spend time discussing the quality of both the video and audio. Blu ray in itself does not necessarily provide better quality.  For those who take the time to provide audio and video quality info, I thank you.
3) I wonder if the powers that be at Amazon actually read any of the reviews.  If they know a release is not a proper remaster or if a new and improved version comes out, why do they continue to sell older/poorer releases.  For example, the 35 years, 35 films collection of Clint Eastwood films had to be the worst, most poorly designed and produced collection ever.  And yet they still sell it.  Don't they have a fiduciary responsibility to their customers to steer them away from such trash production towards those that are of quality?

Well, I just watched the 20th Anniversary Edition on Blu Ray.  Only the extended version is included which is fine by me making the film almost a 4 hour sitting.  The video is artifact free with no obvious grain or aliasing.  However, the imaging tends to be soft though there is good detail in the shadows and darker scenes and a warm color resolution.  Overall,  I do not think this Blu Ray transfer provides that much of an improvement over previous standard def releases.

The Audio is DTS HD 7.1 and the front sound stage is nicely spread with audio levels well done.  Some panning in the fronts but, as this is narrator directed, you will find that there is a severe lacking of channeling to the rears and almost no discreet channeling either which makes me wonder why they went to 7.1 rather than 5.1.  Your sub gets a decent workout in some parts such as the buffalo stampede but this scene also points out the lack of proper use of channeling to the rears such as when the buffalo comes to the camera and runs past over and past it.  There should be just as much noise and rumble to the rears then as there were in the front channels.  It appears that more work went into the music score than it did in creating any foley fx.
As this is now my 3rd, and hopefully last, purchase of Dancing with Wolves, I must admit that while the Blu Ray is very well done, it was also a disappointment as there was no great improvement over my previous extended version.
The extras are plentiful and interesting and should take you several hours to get through them all.

All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.
Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.

184998,5,1562550888,"The theatrical release of DWW already ran over three hours, and in this extended edition it runs just shy of four hours.  The good news is that the added scenes do not slow down the tempo of this film  (with one arguable exception) and the additions do not seem arbitrary or forced.

The high-definition transfer is quite good, and in anamorphic widescreen you get a splendid look at the majesty of the landscape.  Hard to believe that about 70 percent of this film was shot on the Warner Brothers Studios back lot.  You'd never know it to watch the film.

The film holds up well and -- despite some irritation from some corners that this film beat out ""Goodfellas"" for the Best Picture Oscar that year -- it doesn't show wear with age.  DWW paved the way for a small bevy of Western-themed films from Hollywood over the following few years, and we are the better off for it.

185000,5,1562550888,"I didn't really expect much when I saw Dances with Wolves.  Most movies about Native Americans provide only the vision through the lens of the white man.  Somehow, this felt different.  By the time that the story had developed the relationship of a soldier with the Sioux, his acceptance of the Sioux way of life was predestined.  One feels sad that we destroyed the Indian way of life, that we felt that it was somehow inferior.

This is quite an accomplishment for a movie.  This is how a movie makes the transition from entertainment into art.  It tells us something about ourselves that we didn't know.  This movie takes the certainty that we have about the ""American"" way and lets us understand that it fails to include the Native American way.

The performances of the lead characters are superb.  How can you not fall in love with Mary McDonnell?  How can you not wish that your best friend was Graham Greene?  Had the settlers all seen the Indian way of life, would we have settled the west?",1319932800,,999,4.581920903954802

The historical accuracy from the Civil War perspective and the treatment of the main character by the US Army is neither realistic nor plausible. The Indian life scenes, especially the buffalo hunt  are all very well done with terrific acting but on the negative side everyone always has perfect hair brushed-shiny and groomed, even Kevin Costner's hair, and the Indian costuming is always spectacularly colorful but nothing is ever out of place.

185010,5,1562550888,"I'm not suggesting that this film is as good as ""Citizen Kane"" which rightfully deserves the title of best film of all time but the comparisons between Costner and Welles to a certain extent do fit.  Welles' first film was the brilliant ""Citizen Kane"" and his work after that was all downhill when compared with that masterpiece and the same could be said for Costner's ""Dances With Wolves"".  One thing this 20th Anniversary Blu-ray release indicates is that sometimes no matter how long a film is it should be shown in its entirety to be fully appreciated.  I remember watching this in the cinema and as well as the shortened dvd some years later and I never liked it until I saw it here in the way it was originally intended to be screened by the director.  This has now become one of the better films that I've ever seen and the vastly improved picture and sound qualities here as compared with the old dvd that I had is like night and day.  The picture quality is not perfect as there are some weak, grainy frames especially during the night scenes but the vast majority of the film looks majestic in 1080p.  The sound quality in DTS HD MA is also very, very good making this blu-ray the definitive release and the best way to view Costner's ""Citizen Kane"".  The extra disc with special features and making of documentaries is also a nice plus and so is the cardboard slipcase.  Being a lover of Westerns myself it is always nice to watch a great film that shows the perspectives from both sides.  It's been said that there are 3 sides to every story: your side, my side and the truth and so if we truly hope to get at the truth we have to at least hear from both sides so that we can better get at the truth.

Costner's best film in what is currently the best release version.

Actually allows you to continue playing where you left off where other Blu-Rays I've bought recently start all the way back at the Previews/Menus.  I mostly got this because I had the DVD with the Special cover and thicker box and wanted to replace/upgrade it.  The Pre-Purchase price was good and the image showed the special case.  As soon as they all shipped they switched the image to a plain Blu-Ray case which is what I got.  Like others I can report it is the cheap thin things with holes so they save a few cents on plastic.  Both discs were loose, but luckily since Blu-Ray they only had some minor scuffs that wiped off.  This is very bad on Amazon to pull this.  I've reported one other disc falsely listed and promoted this way before, and it is just bad business.  It wouldn't be tolerated on Ebay, and I sure would never expect it from retail.

Costner overall attempt was to show that the plains Indians were not savages but very similar in their values to their Victorian whites.  A BIG LIE.  The plain Indians were barbaric and sadistic beyond any imagination.  It was part of their culture.  Before the settlement of the west by European immigrants, the Indians way of life was one of constant wars between the various tribes.  The losers were raped, sold as prostitutes, scalped, skinned alive and burned on the stake.  For hundred of years, they conudcted this way of life against Mexican settlements, and when the whites came from the east in the 19th century, they suffered the same fate.  A big joke in this movie is portraying the Sue as giving women equal rights, or at least, maintaining a normal marriage.  The warriors used to pick up women as they pleased, drop them, and pick up others.  I know that some of you ignorant liberals will get heart attacked reading this.  Good.  Why don't you look at the truth for a change?  Its easy now with the internet.  The settlement of the west was accompanied by blood and gore of whites who were enslaved and tortured by the natives.

  The strongest impact for me, however, of this director's cut was seeing visuals and scenes that I don't remember seeing anywhere, even though I have been buying ""enhanced"" releases of Dances since VHS! There is one scene of Dunbar looking through his spy glass that is especially breathtaking. The scene is shot through a long lens and at a great distance from Dunbar. The result is massive towering cumulus clouds against a sunset blue sky that seem to rise directly out of the swell where Dunbar is standing. It was probably cut originally because it mirrors another scene on the cutting room floor in which the officer in charge of the abandoned Ft. Sedgewick is looking vainly through HIS spyglass for the relief column which never comes. The Dunbar scene only lasts a few seconds and should not have been cut from the original. The feeling of vastness and ""aloneness"" is overwhelming. I had to replay and freeze the image over and over again (yes, dammit, with tears in my eyes).

185040,5,1562550888,"Academy members love spectacle and sentiment. ""Dances With Wolves"" delivered them masterfully; it's no wonder it won Best Picture.

Though ""Dances With Wolves"" moves at an occasionally measured pace, the relatively slow unfolding of the story and the characters' relationships works to draw the viewer in. The only bad thing is Kevin Costner's (mostly) miserable performance, which, amazingly, /doesn't/ pull down the film with it. But he simply can't act. His delivery is generally weak, flaccid, and unfocused -- and that's when he's working with other actors. When reading text (such as Dunbar's diary), he's even worse -- as clumsy as a teenager in a high-school play. If Costner were as poor a singer as he is an actor, he'd be lucky to be working in a sleazy lounge -- forget the Met.

Watching this film for the third or fourth time, I wondered what the point was. Although the author of the novel (and screenplay) apparently wanted to tell an honest story about America's aboriginal people, he probably felt it would have been too difficult to present it from the native peoples' point of view (how does one properly grasp an alien culture?), and that a sympathetic white character would work as an intermediary. It does, but as the character is a good-hearted ""mensch"", the effect is one of begging forgiveness for the atrocities committed against America's native peoples. *

The Blu-ray transfer is of the 4-hour extended cut, which I and most viewers find superior to the 3-hour theatrical cut. It's not at all ""bloated"" -- but if you don't want to watch all of it at once, a good point to pause is at the end of the buffalo hunt. The extended cut has an important sequence -- Dunbar's seeing the Lakotas' celebration of the killing of white people. His conflicted feelings and recognition that he will never really ""be"" one of these people neutralizes some of the film's ""back to the earth"" sentimentality. (This is a secondary theme -- it's better to live a simple life in which personal relationships dominate, rather than one that's technology-driven.)

The Blu-ray appears to be an excellent transfer, without grain reduction or edge sharpening. (It's hard to judge, because even an indifferent Blu-ray is superior to a projected print.) Colors are believably subtle and subdued, except for blood, which looks overly red. John Barry's excellent score -- which thankfully avoids both Aaron Copland and Elmer Bernstein clichs -- gets a solid 7.1 transfer.

On a side note... 20 years ago, the wolf coming to Dunbar's camp seemed a bit too Disney-ish sentimental. Now that some biologists believe wolves domesticated humans (not the other way around), it appears positively prescient.

The supplemental material is excellent, but slightly less lavish than some other films'. The SD material from previous editions has been carried over, but... it wasn't correctly deinterlaced, and every time something moves more than a little bit, the image breaks up into multi-frame scanning lines. That's unforgivable.

PS: I've somewhat changed my opinion about Costner's ""acting"". It appears he's trying to make Dunbar look ingenuous, and open to other ways of life. That's good, but the character is 100% that way from the beginning. It would have been more interesting if his ""I want to see the frontier before it disappears"" carried an imperialist edge -- as if the frontier were his property, which he wanted to examine before it was taken away.

* In an interview, the author says that the whites refused to do what the Indians did -- they exploited the environment, rather than living in some degree of harmony with it. The Indians were doomed from the start -- the whites produced more calories by farming & ranching than the Indians did by hunting & gathering, and could thus out-reproduce them. The fundamental difference in economic systems was the basic source of conflict, and no amount of good will could have overcome it.",1297555200,6,4225,5.2831594634873325
185041,2,1562550888,"Instead of celebrating 20 years of one of the BEST movies released in the last quarter-century by providing better sound (DTS, anyone?), and new extras, from all of the negative comments as to what a lackluster release this is (especially not well-thought out - placing the entire movie on one DVD instead of two, having to turn the DVD over instead of advancing to the second DVD with the remainder of the movie - who DOES that anymore??), I chose to purchase the 2003 Special Edition 2-DVD Extended Version instead of this release.

Hopefully, they'll get it right (the sound, the extras and even the case!) for the 25th anniversary edition. However, as movie studios and record companies don't usually care what their fans would like, and seemingly don't even take it into consideration - not to mention that this release is hardly a ""labor of love"" (as a celebratory release as this should be), I doubt very much that they'll get it right even then.  Might I suggest an extra along the lines of a photo montage set to a medley of John Barry's sweeping, exhilarating (not to mention Oscar and Grammy winning) score for the film?  This would also be a very nice tribute to Mr. Barry, who passed away on January 30th.  He will be TRULY missed by all of his fans around the world.

As Mr. Barry's score was an integral part of the film, it certainly would be reassuring to know that someone involved with the next release is actually paying attention - if only for that last suggestion alone, as well as to all of the reviews regarding what THIS release could and should have been.

185044,5,1562550888,"In 1990, actor/director Kevin Costner along with novelist/screenplay writer Michael Blake took on an ambitious project of developing a film titled ""Dances with Wolves"" with a budget of only $22 million.  Shot in South Dakota and Wyoming, the epic western would become one of the most memorable films to be created.

With rave reviews, the film would make $424 million worldwide, would be credited for the revitalization of the Western genre in Hollywood and a film that would give Native Americans a sympathetic portrayal.

""Dances with Wolves"" would win a total of 7 Academy Awards including ""Best Picture"", ""Directing"", ""Writing Adapted Screenplay"", ""Cinematography"", ""Film Editing"", ""Sound Mixing"", ""Original Musical Score"" and also win a Golden Globe for ""Best Motion Picture Drama"" and ""Best Director"".

In 2007, ""Dances with Wolves"" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""

While ""Dances with Wolves"" have received a number of DVD releases, from its 180-minute theatrical version in 1998, a DTS version released in 1999 and then a special edition featuring a 236 minute Director's Cut in 2003, ""Dances with Wolves"" receives its first released in HD via Blu-ray with ""Dances with Wolves: 20th Anniversary"" edition which includes the special edition features from 2003 as well as utilizing newer features with Blu-ray technology.

VIDEO:

""Dances with Wolves: 20th Anniversary"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  Having owned previous incarnations of the DVD release, especially the original 1998 DVD release, one thing I have noticed on Blu-ray is how vibrant the colors look on Blu-ray.

From the golden weeds and grass that surround the area and the blue skies up above, You can literally see the shading and detail of those long strands of grass and when it comes to showcasing the Fort or even the Indian camp and seeing the animal hide on the clothing to the tents, there is quite a bit of detail that can be seen.

Also, when you see a close up of Dunbar's face, you can see skin pores, clear stubble.  Especially when you see the war paint applied on the skin surface, everything looks clear and detailed!

Blacks are nice and deep, there is a fine layer of grain. I personally didn't see any blemishes or traces of DNR or any softness.  Overall, awesome PQ for ""Dances with Wolves"".

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Dances with Wolves: 20th Anniversary"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio with English Dolby Surround.  As the majority of the film features dialogue, when there's action...may it be horses riding in the distance, the buffalo trampling and skidding on the ground, the rifle shots, the lossless soundtrack does a good job in making those scenes quite immersive by utilizing every channel.

Even in non-action scenes, a good number of ambiance of how things sound outdoors.  So, bugs, birds, dogs, horses, everything can be heard all around you.

Dialogue is crisp and clear and the music by John Barry is fantastic via lossless!

Subtitles are provided in English SDH, Spanish and French.

EXTRAS:

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Dances with Wolves"" is an important film that will probably be the finest Kevin Costner film ever directed and film that he has starred in.

The film was not only fantastic but it shows how this crew and its talent really went all out in making sure that this film which was seen as not even possible to shoot under $20 million, was successfully made but that they really went all out for this film.

And when I say, ""went all out"", I mean that there were risks that were taken.  The buffalo stampede and having to shoot a bow and arrow to Costner having to ride a horse in the middle of a stampede with both hands on a rifle, many people today would think that whole scene was absolutely crazy (as it would probably be done digitally).  But Costner and crew made it happen!

Also, no matter how execs tried to have Costner and crew cut the film, these men stood behind their work and made sure that their film would not be butchered.  Once again, a film that was seen as improbable was made possible with literally blood, sweat and tears and in the end, the film was amazingly successful.

I know that there are some people who felt that ""Goodfellas"" and even ""The Godfather III"" were deserving of the many awards that ""Dances with Wolves"" had won back in 1990 but really, this epic western was excellent.  When I first watched it, I was surprised because Native Americans in films that do portray Indians, typically portray them as savages.  This was a film that literally shows them as a group that lived off the land, that were there first and were just defending their land and their families.  So, I felt that the screenplay was excellently written by Michael Blake and portrayed quite wonderfully onscreen courtesy of Kevin Costner, Mary McDonnell, Graham Greene, Rodney A Grant, Floyd Westerman, Tantoo Cardinal, Michael Spears and the many talent who made viewers feel this film feel quite authentic.

As for the Blu-ray release, I can tell you right now, even if you own the wonderful 2003 special edition DVD release, the picture quality and lossless soundtrack definitely warrant an upgrade.  Sure, the special features are familiar features to those who own the previous special edition but to watch this in HD, I was quite impressed by the overall detail and how vibrant the film looked.

If you love this film, it's really an easy choice to make, ""Dances with Wolves: 20th Anniversary"" on Blu-ray is highly recommended!",1296259200,30,8982,4.9162234042553195

185053,5,1562550888,"In my opinion, Dances with Wolves is one of the best movies ever made. It is beautifully directed; the cinematography, the costumes, the story, the characters, the acting all come together and create an unforgettable drama from history. It is one of those movies that really brings a new, fresh perspective to history.

I am from a foreign country and I grew up watching American Western movies when I was a kid. In those movies, I remember white guys were always the good guys and Indians were the savages. I always thought there was something wrong with that picture. It seemed to me just too one-sided. For some strange reason, I've always found myself associating myself with the Indians more than the cowboys. Even though they were depicted as savages with primitive, tribal culture, I found something beautiful about that. I always thought using arrows, and axes or just bare hands required more skill and courage. And I never understood why they would be bad if it was their land in the first place. And even though I didn't know much about the US history, I have always thought there would have had to be more to Indians.

Dances with Wolves is a special movie. I believe it is the first movie that gives an insight to the lives of Indians and doesn't depict them as mere savages. It shows the humanistic side of Indians, how they are family oriented, they have high values, like honor and friendship and loyalty. They are not just monsters as older Western movies would have us believe. Dances with Wolves tells the story of John Dunbar who is holding a post at the frontier and befriends Sioux Indians from a near-by village. The movie successfully shows how human beings, no matter how different they seem to be on the outside, they can communicate with each other and form beautiful friendship. This movie accomplishes this, if not anything else. This lesson can be applied to any situation in the world even today where people from different countries, races or religion try to live in peace.

This Blu ray version is only the extended version (4 hours) so you will not have the choice of watching the original theatrical release which is 3 hours. This may be the only downside of this release. Other than this, Blu ray transfer is fantastic. Audio is 7.1 HD DTS which is not very common (most movies are only 5.1). It has bunch of extras and feature commentaries (see the product details page). If you love this movie, you will definitely enjoy the Blu ray picture and sound quailty.

Now for the audio...cover sleeve sticker says ""new 7.1 audio track"".  Video through Oppo 93 hdmi to Samsung LN46 B750.  Audio using optical to Kenwood VR-8070 Receiver.  A capable receiver with THX certification, 5.1 coax, optical and 5.1 multichannel input.  No hdmi in on Kenwood. Disc choices for audio track are: 7.1 DTS or Dolby surround. My receiver is not set up for 7.1 at this time.  There is no 5.1 DTS/Dolby selection for audio on the disc.  Choosing the 7.1 selection on disc provides a very ""hollow"" tin can sound.  Turning up receiver sound output up closer to reference helps...but is much too loud for most scenes. Switching receiver to Dolby surround lights up the front/SW/and a single rear channel.  I am supposing that the rear channel in single mode plays the same sound through both rears.  In Dolby Surround, the sound is fuller and richer with a prominent center dialogue much clearer.

My system is set up correctly.  I can only think that this disc was mastered for use with a 7.1 system.  Although it sounds great with Dolby Surround (no 5.1) the receiver lights up displaying PL2.  Matrixing the audio track.

185055,5,1562550888,"I won't bother going into details about the film itself. If by chance you haven't already seen Dances With Wolves or haven't at least heard about it then there are already hundreds, if not thousands, of reviews already written that go into detail about the film itself. At this point I really don't think I can significantly add to whats already been said about this film. Ill simply say that it was, and still is, one of my all time favorite films.

I am writing this review urging people to buy the 20th Anniversary Blu-Ray Edition for one reason and one reason only, the soundtrack. This is not to say that the soundtrack is the only worthy upgrade in this version, quite the contrary as I think this version is outstanding in every possible way (unlike the previous releases). Its simply because its worth upgrading to just for the soundtrack alone. Its hands down one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard and until you have heard it in all its glory on Blu_Ray....well your really missing out as this is one of those rare films where the soundtrack takes the film to a completely new level and this Blu-Ray version is so superior to the previous releases that its really like hearing it again for the very first time.

I have been a HUGE fan of this score since I first heard it. In fact, its pretty much the only thing I listen to when I go storm chasing every year. I just play it again and again and again and again and I have been doing this since I first started chasing over 10 years ago. I just never get sick of it and its really become one of the staples to my entire trip. The people I chase with actually make jokes over the radio. Statements like ""Oh no, he is playing it again"" followed by laughter are extremely common.

Anyways this release certainly doesn't disappoint in this regard. The 7.1 DTS-HD master, running roughly over 4600kbs, is absolutely breathtaking. Actually breathtaking doesn't even properly describe just how stunning it is. Its really futile even trying to put it into words. I purchased a new audio system from ADA last year and I have never heard my set-up sound this good. I literally sat in awe for the first 30 minutes of the film. It really must be heard to be believed.

Bottom line - There are a lot of reasons to buy this Blu-Ray but for me one reason stuck out far above the others, the score. If your a fan of this film and even remotely enjoyed the score then you should be ordering this as soon as humanely possible. If you haven't seen this film and are a fan of quality scores then your missing out on one of the most iconic American scores ever produced and its never sounded better than it does on the 20th Anniversary Blu-Ray edition. Its like your standing right in the middle of the orchestra. This is really what hi-def is all about.

Kevin Costner's character soon meets this white woman raised by the Sioux, who have given her the indian name of,""Stands with fist,"" and the two of them soon fall in love. By this time Kevin has been welcomed into the tribe and has even been given an indian name of ""Dances with Wolve's.""

John Dunbar becomes a member of this tribe. He soon realizes everything his been told about these people has been lies. He falls in love with them as a people and becomes part of their family, devoted to them and their belief's and their way of life. It isn't long before he learns to speak their native tongue as well.

185062,5,1562550888,"Whoa there, partner! Here is the gospel truth, according to The Digital Bits, MGM Home Entertainment, in conjunction with 20th Century Fox, will release ""Dances with Wolves"" on Blu-ray on January 11, 2011. This BD will present the extended cut of this Oscar-winning western starring and directed by Kevin Costner. Most of the previous DVD extras will reportedly be included, along with newly-produced material. Also, according to Blu-Ray.com, this 20th Anniversary Edition Blu-Ray release will indeed be the Director's extended cut at 236 minutes (3 hrs 56 mins), with the original aspect ratio of 2.39:1, the Video codec of MPEG-4 AVC and the resolution at 1080p.

So, we won't be getting it in time for Christmas, but we're going to be getting the best possible release (read the longest length) and even newly produced material. So, you can stop all the badgering of Amazon and MGM, partners! Mosey on over to your shoppin' basket and drop one of `em in, sign in & place your pre-order. This is just a suggestion, mind you. Amazon will eventually get around to updating their website to reflect 236 minutes for this Blu-Ray version.

Obviously, I cannot rate the video transfer and audio quality of the Blu-Ray edition until after it is released. If it does not measure up to my current rating, I will amend it after having watched the Blu-Ray version. But, my ""Collector's Edition"" SDVD was worth every penny which appeared to push the limits of my top of the line Samsung Blu-Ray (which up-converts SDVD discs) player and Samsung's last year's top of the line LED LCD TV, not to mention the limits of my poor old eyes.

With so much at stake, I am willing to bet MGM took the time and expense to get this one done right this time around. Mine is on pre-order and can hardly wait to saddle up one more time with this old friend.

Now, if they'd only dust off their other classic westerns, restore 'em, remaster 'em and release 'em too...but, that is a whole different story!

True Grit is finally getting the Blu-Ray treatment, but only because of the pending release in theaters on Christmas Day of an updated version with all new stars. They had to be kicked in the britches to get their attention and the original ""True Grit"" was an Academy Award winner for the Duke. It is a crime the way the old classic westerns are being treated by the studios. The demand for quality classic westerns on Blu-Ray is there. The studios are just not listening, nor willing to incur the expense to ""do them right"". I'd better step down from my soap box now, 'cause I get upset when I think about how they're ignoring us classic western collectors.

185072,5,1562550888,"My college-aged son had never seen Dances with Wolves, and I hadn't seen it since I saw in the theaters in 1990, so many years ago. DWW is still a howlingly good movie. Its sweeping vistas of pristine western landscapes and magnificent depiction of life among the Sioux give a reasonable portrayal of what life might have been like on the American Plains before whites took over the place. The story? Kevin Costner plays Colonel Dunbar, who as a reward for a questionable act of bravery during the Civil War, choses to live in the remotest ""fort"" he could find. The place is a devastated mess, with animal carcasses choking the waterway and signs of a desperation and flight everywhere. As Dunbar sets to bring  some military order to the place, he encounters some of the local Sioux who live nearby. Gradually, he begins to learn their language, adopt their ways and learn to love them. And they him.

DWW is a real period piece - by which I mean that it depicts the way Americans were ready to view the ""taming"" of the West from the vantage of the late 20th century. The film's whites are often drunk, depraved, pointlessly violent and prodigiously wasteful. The Sioux are tough, but also intelligent, loving, resourceful and brave. That this revisionist view of history is not entirely accurate is beside the point. After decades portaying Native Americans as crazed, dirty and brutal, a sympathetic depiction of the continent's first inhabitants was long overdue. It's a measure of the degree to which the pendulum is swinging the other way that 20 years later, such sentimental views come across as cloying and naive. Even this film shows the tribe as a macho patriarchy where women are second class citizens

Still, the film's characters were strong and memorable. Stands With A Fist (a stunning the Mary McDonnell), taken into the tribe after a raid wiped out her family is the tribe's only white, and an obvious choice as a love interest for Dunbar. McDonnell's expertly depicted the difficulty of learning to speak a language that she hadn't spoken or heard for decades. Kicking Bird (Graham Greene) is Costner's mentor and protector and initiator into the ways of the Indians. Wind in his Hair is a tough fighter constantly tests and eventually befriends Dunbar. Ironically, only Costner's Dunbar seems bland and uninteresting in the midst of this wonderful cast. I couldn't help but to wonder whether Costner got an ego boost from playing the only white man in America whom the Sioux considered human.

My main beef with Dances with Wolves, now as in 1990, was the lame ending. Costner the director can't ignore the historical fact that these noble people were virtually exterminated shortly after the events depicted in the movie. The narrative arc that Costner follows - Dunbar's psychic voyage from meaningless carnage to harmonious unity -- thus collides with the reality that American history took another path. An explanatory graphic at the end lamely brings the movie to a close, interrupting the action inexplicably and leaving every story unfinished.

Nevertheless, DWW is a classic film, beautifully conceived, shot and acted. The fact that the actors who played the Sioux delivered their lines in Lakota both showed the film's respect for their culture and viewers understand the foreigness of the first encounters with them. Well worth a look, even as we reach for a more nuanced and balanced look at the colonization of the Americas.",1284595200,,3457,4.943201376936317
185073,2,1562550888,"There is a famous piece of educational research where a class of school students compare two films - the 1950s western 'Searchers', and this one, 'Dances With Wolves'. Nearly all of them believed Dances with Wolves to be the more historically accurate film even though it is about as accurate as Mel Gibson's roles in Braveheart, The Patriot (well just about any of his historical roles come to think of it).

This is not a dig at Costner, Hollywood studios or anyone else for producing such a PC pap romantic movie. Storytellers, filmmakers have always distorted history somewhat to tell a good story. The real sadness lies in our own failure of history education, leading to our ignorant credulity when hoards of us watch such films and believe they depict some kind of historical reality.

The product being offered here by Amazon.com is the UK Region-free Blu-ray.  It is NOT the long version as stated, but rather the theatrical release at 181 minutes' running time.  I verified this by ordering the Blu-ray, then actually seeing the correct information on the back of the case.

The back of the case also says ""letterbox,"" whereas on the Amazon.com product page the aspect ratio is given as ""1.78:1"".  However, 1.78:1 fills a 16x9 widescreen TV's screen completely, so it cannot be ""letterbox,"" i.e. with the black bars on the top and bottom of the picture.

Even after I called Amazon Customer Service and pointed out their mistakes on the product page, they have yet to correct the errors after a weeks' time!  Shame on them!

Kevin Costner is director and star of this Civil War era Frontier story.  It has some interesting and action parts, but overall drags in places and the plot could be more meaty.

Costner plays Civil War hero Lt. John Dunbar who asks to be reassigned to the Western United States.  He lands in an isolated post alone.  Slowly he develops a relationship with the Sioux and a romantic interest with a captured white woman (Mary McDonnel).  She has lived among them but remembers enough English to translate and teach so Dunbar and her Chief and Medicine Man can communicate.

He ultimately adopts a Sioux name -- Dances With Wolves -- and completly assimilates with the tribe. When the U.S. Army discovers his actions he is treated as a treasonous deserter.

Over the years I've heard some grumbling about the film's PC-influenced negative portrayal of whites in general and also its supposed romanticized portrayal of Indians as super-virtuous. Hence, before viewing the film again I was braced for the worst. After seeing it, I must say that most of these grumblings are utter hogwash. No kidding. Really, only a rigid white redneck ""patriot"" would take offense to this story (and, don't get me wrong, I'm patriotic but not mindlessly so). The film rings of authenticity and the characters are anything but one-dimensional. Want proof? (No major spoilers).

- The Pawnee are the first Indians the viewer encounters in the film and they are portrayed as completely hostile to whites and other NA tribes -- so hostile that they'll kill a white person on sight without mercy. I'd say this is a negative, stereotypical portrayal of Indians, wouldn't you agree?
- Also, Wind In His Hair clearly states that the Sioux should kill Dunbar at the council meeting; I'm sure there were others who agreed with him but it was ultimately decided that killing Dunbar would likely cause more problems than solve.
- Not all white people are shown in a negative light; in fact, Dunbar himself -- the film's protagonist -- is white. What about the ""foul"" guy, Timmons, who escorts Dunbar to the abandoned fort? I've met people exactly like him. He's not portrayed as evil, merely uncouth in dress and manners. Anyway, when Timmons gets savagely murdered by a band of Pawnee he begs over and over that the Indians not hurt his mules; his dying words are words of love (for his animals!). Also, when he says goodbye to Dunbar at the fort he says, ""Good luck, Lieutenant"" and you know he means it; there was clear love and respect. Obviously this was a disgusting guy with a heart of gold. Again I know people just like him; it rings of authenticity.
- The story takes place during the Indian Wars where there's very little love & compassion of whites towards Indians and vice versa. The U.S. Army is there to do a job and, as usual, go by the book. Is this a negative portrayal or simply the way it was? The answer is obvious. Hence, most of the officers are not shown in a negative light but merely as military leaders carrying out their duty. Although some of the main enlisted soldiers come off as clueless sheetheads, again, the characters ring of true life. I met people just like 'em in the military.
- Besides, I repeat, not all Natives are depicted as virtuous. The Pawnee are obviously ruthless villains and quite a few Indians are shown helping the U.S. Army and are, therefore, traitors to their people.
- Is the small tribe of Lakota Sioux really super-virtuous? Is their lifestyle really a paradise? No, they're merely portrayed as real people living, pursuing happiness, uncertain about the amassing whites, fighting and persevering through hardships (like the winter camp).
- Is the massive annihilation of Bison (leaving their skinless carcasses to rot in the sun) a negative depiction of whites or just the way it was? Such people would likely shoot a wolf for the ""fun"" of it. Again, it smacks of reality.

This is just a taste. Clearly, the people in the film are not as one-dimensional as some maintain. Neither is the movie as pro-Indian/anti-white as some insist. It's more complicated than that.

As to the accuracy of the story itself, the fact is that many whites have ""gone injun"" and many Natives have assimilated with whites. The story explores the possibility of what would happen if a white man dropped all prejudices and tried to get along with some Sioux neighbors; and what if this small band of Natives was open and curious enough to accept him? Is it unlikely that this band would have an available good-looking white woman amongst them that Dunbar could fall in love with? Is there a bit of romanticization? Yes, but it is a Hollywood movie, after all. Regardless, it presented in a believable, compelling and captivating way.

""Dances"" is almost 20 years old but remains timeless like most great films; it is the definition of why films are made.

Other good points besides the cinematography and three likable main characters and McDonnell's romance with Costner, which is one of the best I've seen in a film.

John Dunbar is 'everyman'; learning that his conception of the American Indian is wholly wrong. The minutes pass with the grand scenery.  The story flows with the majesty of the American west.

185115,5,1562550888,"The first time I saw this movie, I was stunned.

I had not seen any previews and so had no expectations. I was so moved by watching it, as were my companions, that we all sat and watched the complete credits roll by before we could get up to leave the theatre. For the first time in my life, I saw a tribe of our Native American population, portrayed as compassionate and caring. This type of information had never been taught in public school or college!

My friends and I stood outside the theatre that night, discussing the wonderful epic we had just experienced, for quite a while. As I drove home that evening I remembered that my maternal grandfather had some Native American blood lines and for the first time in my life I wanted to find out more about them. I doubt that I would have started any ancestry research had I not seen DWW.

It has been 18 years and DWW is still my all-time favorite movie. My ancestry research started after the first viewing and has never stopped. Thanks to the internet and other available resources, my family tree has expanded to over 5,500 people. Many of my Scottish and English ancestors intermarried with Native Americans. I am a veritable Heinz 57 of DNA! I have Cherokee, English, Scottish, and French ancestors, all mixed with remarkable and extended lines from all over the globe.

Whether the story line is credible or not to others, I know it's possible. My great-great-grandfather married a Cherokee woman who had survived the Trail of Tears. Knowing their history, I doubt they would have met or married, had it not been for the help and kind acts shown him by her family.

Watching ""Dances with Wolves"" for the first time was a turning point in my life. So, thank you Kevin Costner and Michael Blake, for making a movie that has been such an inspiration. If watching it does not inspire you, that's okay. I hope that at least you become curious enough, after watching it, to read and research topics concerning the Native American peoples. In the very least - you will be entertained.

185118,4,1562550888,"A film that is truly breathtaking, `Dances with Wolves' has a lot to admire.  The film is gorgeous to look at; beautifully shot by cinematographer Dean Semler and directed by Kevin Costner.  The story told is often engrossing and delicately handled for the most part, always grasping our attention despite the films lengthy running time.  The acting is mostly effective and at times it is amazing.  The emotional impact the audience is left with is sweeping and easy to get caught up in for the subject is presented in a very passionate way by Costner.

Like I said; there is a lot to admire here.

`Dances with Wolves' tells us the story of Lt. John J. Dunbar who, after an attempted suicide, is exiled to a remote Civil War outpost.  Alone and lonely John soon finds himself a target of the Native Americans nearby, but what starts as a hazardous relationship shifts to one of promise and hope as the Indians befriend John.  One particular Indian, Kicking Bird, is determined to communicate with John in order to find out what the White Man's plans are and when he is coming.  Kicking Bird uses Stands With A Fist to do this.  Stands With A Fist is a white woman who has been living as an Indian most of her life.  She hasn't spoken English for many years but forces herself to converse with John for the betterment of her people.

`Dances with Wolves' has a sweeping range of focus, shifting from a drama to a romance to a morally important film, and Costner's steady hand and keen eye help make the transitions effortless and captivating.  The film never comes off as choppy or disconnected but always remains true to itself and for the most part feels very complete.

The acting is a nice facet of the film.  Kevin Costner, Mary McDonnell and Graham Greene all received Oscar nominations for their performances, and it's easy to see why.  Mary McDonnell has a delicate way of delivering her characters frailties, exposing her nervousness without making her feel overly unstable.  Graham Greene is very calm and commanding as Kicking Bird, creating a stable character with dreams and aspirations and a complete control over the situation.  The film hinges on Costner though, and he delivers a beautifully complete performance.  His emotional journey is brilliantly portrayed for us throughout the entire film, flowing effortlessly from loneliness, anger, admiration, love, loyalty, betrayal and honor.

As a whole `Dances with Wolves' works wonderfully; in parts it works extremely well.  The film is not perfect and it suffers in some areas.  One particular area I was less than thrilled about was Costner's narration of the film.  Voice over is tricky because it takes a certain kind of voice to pull it off.  Kevin has a somewhat nasally, almost whiney voice and listening to him practically read to you for three hours can ware you down.  Some people you can stand to talk to but don't want to listen to them `read'; it just has a whole different sound to it.  Watching Costner act is enjoyable, but listening to him read is not.  The ending, while moving, also felt a little forced and the depiction of the settlers as arrogant and uneducated was a little extreme.

I found myself wondering why Dunbar was never depicted in that fashion yet every other `White Man' was?

Those faults are minor when you consider the entire scope of the film, yet they seem bigger when you single them out.  I would recommend this movie without reservation, but I hesitate to call it a masterpiece.  It is a very good film, a great one at that, and as far as `sweeping epics' go, it manages to capture just about every facet of what makes those films to wonderful.  I'd give the film a high B (B+) or maybe even a low A (A-).  It works very well, but it is not perfect.",1221177600,4,3760,4.665653495440729

This classic work was a labor of love in the making; and it shows from top to bottom; from screenplay to direction. Historically, it paints Native Americans in a very humanistic manner, including having a healthy dose of humor, which I can attest to from many personal acquaintances.

I originally saw this in 70mm, and would plop down a hundred bills to see it again in that format; one of my all-time fav movie experiences. The DVD version holds up well, and there is always something new to catch with each successive viewing.

It's funny to read negative reviews which are obviously grounded in either racism or ignorance of true American History, or both. Do the math, read some real history, and you'll find that this era was not exactly the highpoint of Anglo-Saxon compassion. I don't see this as being biased at all; there were some good whites who interacted with NAs; but they were a gross minority. If you're white, as I am, get over it already.

185124,3,1562550888,"Six days.  Four hours. A Native American Kevin Costner.  Graham Greene playing his only clich Hollywood persona.  Finally, it is done.  The ""it"" being referred to is the epic 1990 Oscar sweeping film by Kevin Costner, entitled ""Dances with Wolves"".  My first encounter with this film was when I was very young, enjoying an overnight with a friend, falling asleep to the bountiful landscapes that seemed to go on forever.  It was a film that was hailed a masterpiece by critics, while allowing Costner to finally be able to pick and choose his repetitive roles over the next two decades.  Alas, picking it up, watching it now in its modern high-definition glory - it is still a beautiful film, but it is not perfection.  As mentioned in the first line of this review, Costner's film is not for the amateur film viewer - it is a film that forces you to put on your Buffalo skin, open a fire, and settle in for a very cold winter.  Unbeknownst to me, there is a ""director's cut"" of the film that now ranges nearly four hours.  That is what I settled into and doubtably now, upon my completion, should be called - Sits with Costner Epic.

Hollywood loves the epic.  It doesn't matter much these days what the topic surrounds, as long as there are long picture-esque images of Americana (or some other country), coupled with a tender moment, a blasting score, and sympathy towards anything - than the epic will reign supreme.  For further examples of this see ""Braveheart"", ""The English Patient"", or even Costner's second epic outing ""The Postman"", and while not all of these were Oscar winners, the critics went easy, the crowds faced the screens, and people were happy.

Not me.  Not this time.

""Dances with Wolves"" is beautiful.  The detailed conversion on my new Blu player is and was phenomenal.  The individual blades of grass stood tall and at moments I felt as if I was right there with Costner as he chased Two-Socks, or crossed the sweeping frontier.  Costner's film, if anything, gave a modern technology country a view of a world that nearly feels fictional.  No computers, no cell phones, nothing facing you except nature, and the power of Mother Earth.  Costner captures this feeling with perfection.  Not only does he have the time to cultivate this sensation, but he uses both audio and visual references to assist with his imagery.  There was no doubt in my mind that Costner felt dedicated to this project that his creative eye wasn't at the peak of its existence.  His passion bled through the film, giving us that moment when ""Dances with Wolves"" transforms from Hollywood project to Costner's dream come true.  For that I applaud Costner for following his heart and creating a visual treat that goes beyond your average film.

While Costner's imagery stands powerfully next to any great director's work, it is the overall story that ultimately holds back the rest of the film.  Costner is obviously comfortable behind the camera, but it is his work within the film that feels a bit repetitive and clich.  Costner is not Lieutenant Dunbar.  While he is the imaginative force behind the story, he cannot seem to tackle the character itself.  Costner never quite transforms himself into something we haven't seen.  Perhaps watching it during its release would have been a different story, but in 2008, one watches Costner be Costner only in Native American headwear.  The scenes in this film where he first encounters the sounds of the frontier, or later when he finds an unseen love, were utterly dishonest.  Costner was Costner; there was no other way to see it.  The only parts that glimmered with a possible character were the beginning run through the barrage of open bullets, and the violent reintroduction to the white culture near the end were satisfactory, but for just a few short moments.  Costner needed to tell us more about Dunbar, give us either flashbacks of his life or his reason for making decisions.  The voiceover wasn't convincing enough as a conscious to give us true rhyme or reason.  Those puppy dog eyes that Costner blasted any chance he had never gave us the torment that obviously dwelled within this man.  There was a reason for his possible suicide attempt and escape into the wild.  With no mention of family or history, it is difficult to understand Costner's why.

With Costner misleading us through the mapping of this film, it was left up to the other players to demonstrate a goal at the end of this four hour tunnel.  This semi-happened with Graham Greene's character and Catherine McCormack's role, two people forced into clich roles that they have played time and time again.  This time they pulled it off well, but I just didn't believe them.  Greene plays this character in every film he has ever been in, while McCormack's character was a cross between Helen Keller and Pocahontas.  Not to sound offensive to Native American's, I was happy to see a sympathetic view of them via Costner's eyes, but it felt used.  Hardship seemed to be an unknown word to this tribe.  Costner was able to walk on in, build relationships, not worry about food rations, and easily jump right into the culture without any worry.  There was never a moment where I found myself saying, ""Ah, is he going to make it?"" - the simplicity of it all seemed faked and merely in place for emotions sake.

Finally, the question of time has to be approached.  Did Costner need four hours to tell this story?  Alas, no.  Using the beautiful landscape he merely bought time, aka filler, to push his simplistic tale from average story to epic.  In two hours, Costner could have pushed the emotional button further and really dedicated himself to his character.  At pushing 245 minutes, we felt as if we lost the character of Dunbar after the first hour and a half.  With such a broad canvas, not enough was dedicated to the right parts.  Costner's relationships with the other characters were pushed so far that a sense of apathy was built.  Any cares that we had were brushed away at the two and a half hour mark.

Overall, Costner's film probably deserved the Oscars at the time - but it currently doesn't stand alone as a modern masterpiece.  Costner misjudged this film pushing the framing too far and loosing the central focus.  His character of Dunbar seemed more like an imitation of Droopy Dog in the frontier, instead of a stylized representation of a true soul.  Costner does powerfully show us a sympathetic view of the Native American culture during the time of its downfall, but with such an epic nature I expected it to carry more realism.  The Sioux has danger, they had fears, and they had their own to worry about, but once Costner appeared we saw none of that.  Costner was so excited about learning about them, about communicating with them, that we never quite had the chance to see their world.  Costner must be given credit for his eye in this film.  While his directing skills were not as I anticipated, his visual eye was superb.  Images that may never be captured again were detailed throughout, giving us the view of an epic - although lacking the other parts.  ""Dances with Wolves"" is worth viewing at least once, but another four hours could not be done by this critic even if life depended on it.

185127,5,1562550888,"There is good reason this masterpiece film won at the Academy Awards, and good reason it has garnered rave reviews worldwide.  'DWW' is easily one of the best, quality American epic movies ever made.  The story and acting is absolutely moving and believable, and the scenery and cinematography stunning to say the least.  You have to be an automaton, or someone with a very selfish and/or skewed personal agenda, to dislike this great film.  In the end, it was about how we displaced the true natives of North America, mainly the various indian tribes and groups interspersed throughout the continent for thousands of years before we moved here.  Moreover, it was the story of an American who learned a lot about himself from his interaction with the Sioux, and who ultimately had to choose between living with his society or that of the Sioux people and be considered a 'traitor'.  Powerful and compelling, without a doubt.",1204243200,2,924,4.891025641025641
185128,5,1562550888,"I could write a lengthy review of the movie, but I don't think they provide enough space. This has long been a favorite movie of mine. I love listening to the Sioux language, I love the imagery (grew up about two hours west of where this movie was shot) and I love the storyline.
One word of caution - this movie is the extended cut, NOT the original version. So, it's about 4 hours long. (whew!) Many of the extra minutes were just longer scenes that existed in the theater-released version, but there are also some scenes that will give you new insight into the characters and motivations behind the film. Most notably, the scenes with the troops at Fort Sedgewick before Lt. John Dunbar arrives and the reasons behind Dunbar's sleeping alone the night before the buffalo hunt. Overall, I recommend this movie to someone who has already seen the previous version and loves it... because let's face it, a four-hour movie, good as it is, is freakin' LONG!",1204156800,2,955,4.623529411764705
185129,2,1562550888,"Wow, what a movie filled with contradictions.

First off, the positives:
The scenery in this film was WONDERFUL. Nothing short of epic. My hat is off to whomever engineered or imagined all that; he/she did a GREAT job !!
The same for the costume people - everything seemed correct (to my inexpert eye:).
The Buffalo scenes are particularly to be complimented. I'm sure there were animal handlers involved; in fact, I think I read about that years ago, how special care was taken with the animals. That is commendable...

The negatives:
Unfortunately, this part steals the show....It begins with Costner himself; he is a limited actor (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, with his American accent, etc) who is not suited to a ""rugged character"" role which this called for.

The worst part, of course, is the politically correct (PC) portrayal of the native Americans. The Sioux tribe is portayed, arbitrarily the viewer must assume, as ""innocents"" while the Pawnee are thrice shown as evil or savages (they steal the white girl Stands With a Fist, then later happen to raid her village when she is an adult; they murder the uncouth but endearing Timmons, the mule skinner. Incidentally, this actor was the best in the movie, imho).
The Sioux, the quintessential Plains tribe, are depicted as peaceful, taking only what they need and living in harmony with nature; they don't build anything or disrupt the environment, and when they fight it is ONLY to protect their local village from a direct threat (this has overtones of Anarchist political philosophy), and they care for one another.
Is this accurate?? Well, the Plains Indian culture was a warlike, nomadic existence, living in a harsh environment...But the movie never shows the day-to-day harshness of the Plains culture - for example, the elderly woman, whose husband has died, being turned out of a village in winter to sleep with the horses (she has become a liability to the nomadic tribe - with her husband dead she is considered 'dead'); the initiation rites of manhood that must be endured by young men (the failure of which could result in banishment). In short, it portrays all that was good about native American life, while almost TOTALLY disregarding its negatives - without which they would hardly be a part of humanity. The film is silly in this regard...
Compare it to the excellent, more mature 1993 film ""Last of the Mohicans"" starring Daniel Day-Lewis (much the better actor than Costner). This film correctly portrays the native Americans as ""players"" rather than ""pawns"" in the international game of Who Gets America. In ""Mohicans"" the Indians are correctly well armed, reasonably aware of the politico-military machinations going on around them (in which they in fact partcipate - e.g. the French and Indian War), and above all are shown with human foibles and vices - the same greed, aspirations, etc...
I mentioned ""well armed"" above. This is particularly misunderstood today. The Indians realized the value of firearms and modern weapons almost immediately upon European settlement. There was a thriving arms trade very soon after Eurpeans arrived. The Indians didn't have the skill to make them yet, but they knew they wanted/needed them. (Research the Battle of Little Bighorn, for one example of white misunderstanding of Indian arms.)
But in Dances w/ Wolves, it appears the Indians are completely under-armed and, in fact, totally oblivious to European technology until they meet Dunbar. This is ridiculous.

Ah well...This movie rested its laurels on an incredibly good scenery/cinematic effort, and a sympathetic PC culture of the very late 1980s and early 1990s as far as its ""theme"" or ""messsage"" was concerned.
Its weakest link is Costner who is a marginal actor, much less a director...I can't help wondering what Day-Lewis, teamed with a competent director, might have done with this idea?
The movie did help kick off a resurgence of Western-themed movies, but thats about it.
Regretably, I give it a couple of stars for the scenery, and try to put it out of mind. Its a shame, because this had a lot of potential....",1203724800,18,4104,5.013196480938417

185136,5,1562550888,"Dances with Wolves is a 1990 epic film which tells the story of a United States cavalry officer from the Civil War who travels alone into the frontier near a Sioux tribe. Developed by director/star Kevin Costner over 5 years, the film (released 21 November 1990) has high production values[1] and won 7 Academy Awards (1990) and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama[2] Much of the dialogue is in the Lakota language with English subtitles, unusual for a film at the time of its release.

Great cast, scenery, historical

Trivia: Because Lakota contains both masculine and feminine forms of speech, the filmmakers decided to simplify the language by using the feminine form for all Lakota speech in the film. Native speakers of Lakota were reportedly highly amused by hearing warriors and other men in the film speak as if they were women. {wikipedia}",1196035200,2,868,4.8979591836734695

I used to watch it as a kid but I saw it again 6 months ago and re-realized how much I love this movie.  Not many things have brought me to tears of joy but this movie has done so in multiple places.  To see the beauty of the brotherly love that is learned and shared among the white man and the natives in this movie is a wonderful fulfilment of the love of Christ.  I only wished that our history would have shown this type of love instead of the brutal greed and ignorance that lead our nations pioneers to savagely murder all the natives and steal their land.,1193184000,,689,4.036764705882353

I would also add that this is a long movie, but it puts you right there on the prairie and some of the moments are almost excruciatingly beautiful. This a film not to be missed.",1192492800,3,543,4.08411214953271
185139,5,1562550888,"I first watched Dances With Wolves in a movie theater in 1990 when the movie was first released, and have since seen it on cable TV, network TV, several times on VHS, at least 8 or 9 times on DVD, and again last night! I can't praise this movie enough, and every time I watch it, it brings me back to where I belong.

It's the story of Civil War Union Army Lt. John Dunbar (Kevin Costner), who after being designated a hero, chooses to be stationed on the western frontier ""before it's gone"". He arrives only to find a deserted post on the Dakota plains and believes he will be sent reinforcements later. He becomes friendly with a lone wolf he calls Two Socks, and forms a tentative relationship with members of a nearby Lakota Sioux tribe. Time passes, the troops don't show, and Dunbar spends more and more time with the Lakota. He eventually unites with them, becomes an honorary member of the tribe, and joins them and their way of life.

Dances With Wolves was also directed by Kevin Costner, and he really did his homework for this one, going the extra mile to make this a realistic  portrayal of the 19th century Lakota Sioux people. The actors that portray the Sioux are Native Americans who speak Lakota in the movie (with English subtitles), and the clothing, weapons, and customs are all accurately replicated. There is even a realistic and exciting buffalo hunt that is actually quite a film making accomplishment.

The central character here is played by Costner, but the real star of the movie is Graham Greene, who plays Kicking Bird, the temperate and wise Lakota medicine man (Greene was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor).

This is a serious movie, but instead of being preachy and driven, it's compassionate and deliberate. The story and the relationships are given time to develop, making the highly unlikely circumstances a little easier to digest and the characters more familiar and interesting.

There is nothing political at all about Dances With Wolves. There's no lecture. It's just the story of a white man who finds that what he's been conditioned to believe about ""the enemy"" is not true at all. As he gets to know them and observe their way of life, he sees them for what they really are. People.

The scenery in the movie is breathtaking, the music is beautifully moving, and the acting is captivating and balanced. Dances With Wolves won seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture. And I personally like Dances With Wolves so much that I can't imagine enjoying another movie as much as I've enjoyed this one over the years.",1191369600,2,2637,4.707158351409978

I have a multi-disk player so I can just put them in the player and select which movie I want to see, sort of like a juke box, but with this DVD's arrangement, that isn't possible.  Out of over 400 DVD's this is the only one that does such a thing (other than having a full screen on one side a widescreen on the other, that's Ok).

185142,4,1562550888,"Let me just get my quibble with the aura around this movie down first so that all the people who want to give me unhelpful votes will have some ammo in their guns: what about the Pawnee?  This movie was credited with turning around the cinematic view of Native Americans by making them the good guy.  And to a large degree it does just that, showing the Sioux through the eyes of an outsider who grows to love and respect them while spurning the decadent culture he used to be a member of.  However, while the Sioux are portrayed wonderfully and humanely, the Pawnee come across just as badly as any ""Red Indian"" ever did in the 1950s.  They scalp a defenseless man, launch an attack on a defenseless community full of women and children, make evil-sounding war cries, etc.  Oh, and in Stands-with-a-Fist's flashback sequence, we learn that Pawnee massacred her whole family too.  This isn't really a major problem, but it is certainly something that should be thought of before heaping so much praise on the film for its ""revisionist"" leanings, especially since (as far as I'm aware) the Sioux were the masters of the Great Plains rather than the Pawnee.

Nonetheless, the movie still earns a hearty 4/5 star recommendation.  While I wouldn't have minded focusing a little less on Stands With A Fist and more on the more interesting Sioux characters, I recognize that this is John Dunbar's story and she represents a large part of it.  The acting is very good (including a career-best turn by normally-iffy Kevin Costner), the action sequences are good verging on spectacular, and it comes to a very emotional but unmanipulative conclusion.

has anybody noticed, that in the 2 disc Collector's Edition, disc two bears the same material as on the second side of disc one?

When reviewing a product should be specified as is and not by its merits alone.

Unfortunately on the copy I did receive, following special features were totally missing:

1. No Dances photo montage with introduction by Ben Glass;

2. No Poster Gallery;

3. No TV Spots;

4. No Theatrical Trailer;

5. No ...and More! as advertised so pompously on the outer jacket...

All you get, and this already on the double-sided disc One, is the original Making of... and two separate commentaries, as well as John Barry's Music Video.

That's it!

Is it a packaging error? Go figure.

But you certainly don't find the above mentioned, and advertised items.

The movie is is presented on the two sided disc in its lengthened version and in full 2.35:1 screen ratio. The sound, as correctly stated is in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Stereo and is excellent.

I don't mind so much the missing specials, since the movie alone is a tiny masterpiece in its own right, but I do object to some practices, as to print things on sleeves, that do not correspond to the actual contents of the DVD box.

The second disc is just a repeat of part two of disc one...

185149,5,1562550888,"Even in it's original 3 hour running time, the film still felt a bit too hefty. Like in a lot of cases of extended editions (as opposed to director's cut), the extended version is simply an alternate take; a kind of optional version of the film should you feel compelled to see it. I always liked Dances with Wolves, the directorial debut for Kevin Costner and multiple Academy Award winner, but I always felt like the sum of its parts won me over but maybe not as a unified whole.

Lt. John Dunbar is a United States officer during the Civil War and after an unsuccessful suicide attempt of him running bare into enemy fire but miraculously surviving, he has the option to be posted anywhere. He picks Fort Sedgewick, a distant and remote outpost where he'll live by himself. Hanging around the camp is a wolf he names Two-Socks and nearby is a Sioux village that over time, he becomes friends with and even becomes part of their community. A relationship with one of the women develops but he still has to deal with the approaching officers who want to conquer more land, effectively driving out the Sioux.

The extra scenes are meant to develop the story and offer more background and taken on their own, they actually work pretty fine. Instead of finding Dunbar's new post deserted, we actually see officers previously stationed had just left. We get more screentime with some minor characters which help flesh them out but takes away from Dunbar himself and losing the focus on him. All of the scenes gives off the feeling of making a movie more longer than it should be (as Costner says himself in the commentary when he says ""it's not a secret I like long movies"") but luckily there's a disc change so you don't watch all 4 hours in one setting.

As far as the film is concerned, it's quite a great film with some gorgeous cinematography, excellent performances and some pretty exciting action scenes. Costner might not have the most immense range but there is quite a few films where he is convincing and this is one of them. I have 2 complaints as a whole: the narration is read like a kid who's asked to read book passages in class with a kind of uninvolving drone. When the officers show up they almost have this kind of malevolent quality where they're portrayed as hick morons with guns. Other than that though I don't have any issues with the film and while it's probably something I won't turn on constantly, whenever I do watch it I still like it.

One concern that I wish was addressed as to where the special features are. It reminds me of the Lord of the Rings extended cuts where all the main in-depth featurettes were on the longer, expensive cut so while I have no issues with the stuff we get on here, with 2 commentaries and a feature-length documentary broken in halves, it would've worked a bit if the option of having all of it on the theatrical edition would help people who want the bonus parts but not to have it attached to the longer version of the film.

It probably isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea and there are even times where I'm not that big a fan but there's other times where I do get quite involved in it so give it a shot and see what you think. Word of caution: the theatrical edition normally available is full screen so it's either a 4 hour widescreen or a 3 hour full. I can't stand full so buying this one was inevitable.",1174176000,2,3376,4.447495961227787
185150,5,1562550888,"Dances With Wolves grew on me. When I first saw it many years ago, I was unimpressed and thought it was an example of the shallow ""whites bad/minorities good"" school of thought wherein oafish, cruel whites trample down saintly earth-child Indians who live as one with the planet, and never seem to speak using contractions. But over time I eased up on Dances With Wolves and recognized it for its beauty, for its intricacy, for its story of friendships overcoming outward divisions, and for its epic exploration of a lost culture and its way of life. It never fails to touch me, seeing as I am a depiction of the last free generation of a people who will face near genocide within a decade. It always makes me wonder what happened to this character, or that character. I think I know the grim answer.

I still find the first third of Dances With Wolves to be slightly slow moving, and I absolutely hate seeing things crumble in the final forty or so minutes of this motion picture, but for that inner hour of the film, Dances With Wolves truly ranks high on the list of American movies made in its time. I think it is a sign of Dances With Wolves' quality that it seems to grow better on each occasion I see it.

With the recent release of Mel Gibson's Apocalyto, and also from such past films as Windwalker, Black Robe, and Dances With Wolves itself, I think Hollywood should take note that  there is a lot that can be achieved story-wise in setting a film in pre-Columbian times.

185157,4,1562550888,"I really enjoyed this highly photogenic western with Costner as a Civil War wounded veteran who desires to go west in exchange for his heroic if not Christ like wounding that broke a military stalemate virtually by spirit as opposed to a tactical explanation. That spirit pervades through the movie as Costner's character has a level of honesty mixed with naivety that serves him well with his encounters, not so much with the civilized man, but with domestic animals, starting with his horse, animals of the wild and his future Lakota friends. The film captures the lifestyle of the Sioux from Costner's eyes but also gives the viewer the 180 view of the Sioux, looking at the white men as peculiar and wasteful while the Sioux explaing their own values to Costner and by example. An absolutely beautiful movie with an added love interest as Costner meet's a woman within the tribe that creates an unusual but accepted match. I prefer the original cut as opposed to the long version, which is truer to the book. In the long cut, like in the book, the mystery of what happened to the platoon assigned to Costner's assigned fort/redoubt is clearly shown; however, in the edited commercial cut, you see the fort as Costner sees it, as an unsolved mystery. I think maintaining the mystery strengthens the movie as the viewer knows no more than Costner. I also did not think the extra scenes of the eccentric but debilitated commander that assigns Costner add anything to the movie, the edited version requires the viewer to figure out the obvious by themselves and not have it expanded unnecessarily. One criticism of the film is that it shows the Lakota to be abused by other tribes when in fact; the Sioux were the dominant tribe on the plains and feared by the Crow, Pawnee and Shoshone. However, not knowing the exact time span, by the 1870s if not earlier, the Crow, Pawnee and Shoshone did become allies with the soldiers against the Sioux and that is certainly accurate. Well done film and Graham Greene (Thunderheart) and Rodney Grant (Son of the Morning Star) play realistic thoughtful and brave Sioux respectively.",1164499200,3,2121,4.797814207650274
185158,5,1562550888,"""Dances With Wolves"" is another great period piece that I can watch at least once a year, never tiring of the western frontier against mesmerizing setting and John Barry's Oscar-winning stirring music...

The motion picture is told through the words and experiences of a civil war soldier, Lieutenant John Dunbar, and Costner makes it an intensely spiritual journey which challenges the individual in so many ways...

After his suicidal and successful ride on the battlefield, Lt. Dunbar accidentally leads Union troops to victory against the Confederates... He is allowed to select his own reassignment... John opts to retreat into the wilderness, to the furthest frontier, where both the Sioux and Pawnee Indians still rule...

The film perfectly captures the finest kind of American audacity when Costner rides out alone in the Lakota plains, wearing full dress uniform and holding the large American flag to formally introduce himself to his Sioux neighbors... and the worst of America, the cruelty exercised by the army when it's found he's a Yankee soldier turned Indian and arrested as a traitor...

But it's the gentle humor and intimate moments of the movie which give Costner's ambitious epic Western its special flavor: scenes with Dunbar and his wild wolf Two Socks not daring, at first, to eat from his hand; his funny first encounter with a peaceful man Kicking Bird (Graham Greene); his love story with a stolen white woman living with the tribe called Stands With a Fist (Mary McDonnell); his relationship with a fierce impulsive warrior Wind in His Hair (Rodney A. Grant); and many others as Black Shawl (Tantoo Cardinal) advising her husband on affairs of the heart...

With its share of bow-and-arrow fights, joyous buffalo hunts, and unprecedented tender feelings for the American Indians, ""Dances With Wolves"" remains an amazing accomplishment and a magnificent tribute for a culture lost over time...",1162684800,3,1922,5.207119741100324

185160,5,1562550888,"Dances With Wolves is not only the highest grossing western of all time, but is considered by many to be one of the greatest films of all time. I couldn't agree more.

I have a special place in my heart for this movie especially since I have taken a missions trip up to Pine Ridge, SD where the Lakota reservation now exists. It is deplorable, but that's a whole other subject. Back to the movie...

Despite the fact that the movie is over 3 hours long, it never really drags because the story is so good. Costner's character, John Dunbar, is determined not to lose his leg, which was badly wounded in battle. It is an excruciating scene when he has to slip his leg back into his boot! John Dunbar wishes to see the frontier before it is gone and his request is granted. The journey that begins there changes him in a postive way when he befriends the Sioux (Lakota) Indians, finds a sort of companion in a lone wolf (which he names ""Two Socks""), and falls in love with ""Stands With A Fist"", played by the wonderful Mary McDonnell.

The experiences John Dunbar has with the Indians teaches him that not all the natives are hostile and savage. That they are a simple people who live off the land, waste nothing and only desire to be left alone to live in peace on the land they inherited from their ancestors. He particularly grows fond of ""Kicking Bird"" played by Graham Greene.

There is plenty of excitement between the Buffalo (ttonka) Hunt, the fight with the Pawnee and the clash between the Cavalry Soldiers and the Sioux. The scenery is sometimes breathtaking and at least for me, makes me long for a more simple landscape than the one I see when I drive to work everyday. Truly, our country should always preserve whatever huge chunks of land can be preserved for future generations to be able to observe, walk, ride and breathe-in the wonder of God's creation.

Add to the mix a sweeping and inspirational score by John Barry (his magnum opus IMHO) and you have one solid, beautiful film.",1156377600,5,1997,4.505524861878453

185164,5,1562550888,"This is simply my favorite film of all time. This is the closest to perfect I have found. When thinking about all of the elements that make up a great movie - writing, directing, acting, cinematography, scoring - you just can't take any marks off for this movie. IF you haven't seen it and you only listen to one review of mine, make it this one.

This is a true epic. Sweeping scenery, beautiful music, a terrific story, wonderful acting and great directing. The special edition DVD is absolutely wonderful. It contains never before seen scenes. It takes the movie to just about 4 hours but it is worth it. Have I said I just love this movie yet?

Okay if you don't know anything about this movie you are in for a treat. Kevin Costner plays Lt. John J. Dunbar (not DumBear, you'll get that when you watch the movie) a soldier who tries to end his life with a crazy stunt but ends up being viewed as a hero. Because of this act, he is awarded Cisco, a US Army Horse who you end up just loving and is allowed to choose any post he wants. He decides to be sent to a US Outpost on the frontier so he can see the frontier before it disappears. Upon arrival he finds the post deserted but decides to stay anyways, while the man who brought him there goes back to let the Army know what is going on.

-----------------------------------
SIDEBAR: Robert Pastorelli, best known for playing the painter Eldin on the TV Series Murphy Brown, plays a small but memorable roll as Timmons, the man who takes Dunbar to the frontier. As Dunbar says in the movie, ""He is quite possibly the foulest man I've ever met."" That line is not a lie. Pastorelli makes the most of his screen time and has you laughing out loud because it's all funny when it isn't directed at you.
------------------------------------

While waiting for the Army, Dunbar befriends a wolf who he names Two Socks. (When I say befriends, I mean as much as a wolf will allow). Dunbar also begins to to see signs of Indians, which he is afraid of. Finally he decides to go out to the Indians instead of being afraid and waiting for them to come get him. Now this is where the movie gets really good.

From here on out it is about his relationship with the Sioux Indians, falling in love with one of them, and finding out who he really is. It is terrific to see a man change into who he is supposed to be, and that is what you get here. Dunbar goes through many changes and grows tremendously all while building a strong relationship with the tribe, especially Kicking Bird (Graham Greene), Stands With A Fist (Mary McDonnell) and Wind in his Hair (Rodney A. Grant).

Kicking Bird, played brilliantly by Graham Greene, is the tribes Holy Man. He is the one who reaches out to Dunbar and tries to find out how many white men are coming. The relationship between Dunbar and Kicking Bird is a struggle but it is enjoyable to watch. While Kicking Bird's main objective is to get information, he can't help but admire and respect Dunbar for his actions and thoughts.

Stands With A Fist, played terrifically by Mary McDonnell is a white woman who was raised by the tribe. As a white woman, it is she who is expected to translate and help Dunbar and Kicking Bird talk. Watching her struggle with this at first is wonderful. It makes sense that this is who Dunbar falls in love with. The two of them have sparks flying off them and the passion between them is electric.

Wind In His Hair, played spectactularly by Rodney A. Grant, is the wild warrior who has a hatred for Dunbar immediately and tries to fight any feelings of like for him throughout the movie.

The internal struggles of the characters is just one of the added measures that makes this film glorious. This is not a typical Western and it is not filled with lots of action and cgi. The strength of this film lies in its characters and the writing. These are well-defined characters who grow before your eyes. They have a depth that most movies don't bother with anymore.

There is so much more to this movie but I feel I have already said too much. It is a fiction movie and as such uses creative license, some of which has caused people to get angry. It is not meant to be historically accurate. It is meant to entertain and that it does. It pulls you into the frontier and that time in our history. It allows you to see and feel what that time might have been like.

I just can't say enough how great this movie is. Don't let the length of the movie turn you off. The length is one of its strengths. Get the movie, get comfortable and get ready for a treat. It is worth every minute.",1149724800,16,4594,4.3676814988290396

185166,4,1562550888,"Kevin Costner undoubtedly had epic aspirations for Dances with Wolves.  His desire to create a cinematic powerhouse, on par with ambitious classics like Gone with the Wind, is clear from the movie's length (a never dull 3 hours); its fastidious attention to details; its grandiose, swelling score; its noble subject; and its breathtaking visuals.  While the film excels on several levels, it is in this last area - its cinematography - that I feel Dances with Wolves achieves its greatest success.  Its colors are rich and warm, the sweeping landscape shots are amazing, and several scenes - especially a buffalo hunt - demonstrate absolute cinematographic and directorial mastery.  If for no other reason, I would recommend watching this movie for its aesthetic pleasures.

As far as the story goes: Costner stars as John Dunbar, a Union Army officer stationed - at his own request - at an isolated post in the Western frontier.  It is here that he develops a relationship with the local Sioux tribe.  The story unfolds as you might expect: Costner grows to respect the Sioux and their way of live; there are battles; there is a romance ...to tell you the truth, the plot - for me - was pretty unexceptional.  Costner's character is a perfect hero: brave, noble, kind (in other words, somewhat flat).  The Sioux are, likewise, practically faultless: they demonstrate tight familial bonds; they live in harmony with the land; they are funny, smart, and fairly open-minded when it comes to this white stranger.  And the white men in the film - with the exception of Costner - are crass, close-minded, ignorant and violent.  I do not mean in any way to condone our country's history of horrific violence and greed when it comes to our relationship with Native Americans; I am only pointing out that this film's characterizations are somewhat easy.  I think the film might have been even more interesting and challenging if it would have portrayed its characters (specifically its white characters) in a more complex and a less typecast manner.  But this is a minor complaint (in any case, it probably makes up for all those old Westerns that portrayed Native Americans as uncouth savages).  While this movie is not exactly groundbreaking, it is very sweet, very entertaining and very well done.  It's certainly worth a watch.",1146441600,3,2323,4.951030927835052

185168,5,1562550888,"Dances With Wolves is a cinematic masterpiece - a tour de force almost beyond the power of words to praise or describe.

This film gathers its power slowly but steadily, and unleashes it with an irresistible tidal wave of feeling that blurs the lines between a theatrical experience and a genuine outpouring of very real grief at the tragedy of the American West.

When John Dunbar encounters Stands With Fist under a tree, mourning her dead husband with blood flowing from her wrist, he binds her wound with an American flag.  If the symbolism of that moment doesn't have the tears pouring down your face, nothing will.

This is perhaps the first film in the history of American cinema to have the courage to represent faithfully the noble people that we destroyed in our rushed hunger for land, for gold, for riches.  In John Dunbar's transformation from army officer to honorary Lakota Sioux, we are confronted with our own failure, our own short-sightedness, in imposing our own beliefs and culture on people who needed nothing from us but to be left alone.

Of course it wasn't possible.  The moment the first white man crossed the Mississippi River, the open West's days were numbered.  We encountered people who built no fences, who owned no land, who gathered no wealth and who saw the land and the animals not as something to be conquered or tamed, but as something to be worshipped.  We met these people, and in our greed-distorted vision, we saw them as savages.

Dances With Wolves clears our vision, and gives us a haunting, powerful, wrenchingly-evocative glimpse of what was lost by both Indians and Whites in the clash of cultures.",1143676800,2,1647,4.808510638297872

The theatrical release leaves many questions unanswered, such as what happened to the original soldiers of Fort Sedgewick, how did Stands With A Fist's husband die, etc.  The Special Extended Edition answers all these and more.

The SE Edition also shows some aspects of character development that are necessary to fully understand who the characters are.  And in some cases, the actual meaning of a scene or message is completely changed in the SE Edition, such as when Dunbar decides not to sleep in the Sioux camp the night before the big buffalo hunt.  In the theatrical release, you believe that he is embarrased about what the white hunters did to the valley of buffalo - in the SE Edition, the order of scenes is different and it is because he is feeling conflicted after seeing his Siuox friends catch and execute the white hunters.

The theatrical release left me with the message that the unfeeling white man had brutally invaded the native's world and destroyed it - the SE Edition leaves me with the message that we're all the same regardless of what color we are and where we come from, some good, some bad, but all just trying to survive.

I liked the theatrical release, but I loved the SE Edition.  I never did buy a copy of the theatrical version, but I did record over the one I taped. I would recommend to anyone interested in this genre, the west, people, or just a great movie to get the SE Edition (and forget about the theatrical release).",1141257600,10,1550,4.652014652014652
185173,5,1562550888,"There's not much one can say about this magnficent achievement in film-making that hasn't already been said by others, so I'll content myself with just discussing one key point.

The four hour edition is not a compromise or an explotive ""director's cut"" that studios often put out just to sell another copy.  This version is closer to what Costner orignally envisioned, and the orignal team was initmately involved in producing it.  The movie was edited down to 181 minutes at the order of the studio/distibutors.  They felt people wouldn't sit through a four hour movie.  Who knows, they may have been right.  Besides, a shorter length means you can run it more times and sell more tickets.  Since the studio was gambling big with this movie (no one guessed it would be the monster hit it was) already, they probably wouldn't have released it at all at its original length.

This version  has a differnt feel to it than the theatrical release.  It explains more (like why the fort was abandoned when Dunbar arrived) and in some places it's darker.  The Sioux are not all purely good.  The scene where the Indians catch the buffalo hunters and Dunbar's reaction to what's going on (in the extended edition) is very, very powerful.  We are quite fortunate that we at home can see both versions of the film.  BTW, this wasn't because of DVD, both the long  and theatrical versions were released in VHS letterbox.

It's interesting to compare and contrast the theatrical and Extended versions.  It's  a pity that the theatrical version in widescreen is no longer available new on DVD.

185179,5,1562550888,"I was debating an excellent vs. a very good rating for ""Dances With Wolves"".  I settled for excellent because my objections probably pale (no pun intended) in comparison to the accomplished movie Kevin Costner has put together.  It is an epic film that tells the tale of the Plains Indians a few short years before the Battle of the Little Big Horn.  It intends for us to get a sense of the life and times of that era and I felt that objective was stunningly achieved.  Indeed, short of a documentary, this movie does as well in that area as any other movie I've seen.  You might say that Costner was content not to let the plot get in the way of the story.  On that basis alone, this is an excellent movie.

My qualms with the movie are two-fold and, unfortunately, they have to do with racial matters.  First, the White people in ""Dances With Wolves"" generally come across as stupid, bigoted jerks.  I am more than ready to concede that this was probably true of a lot of people Costner meant to portray.  However, starting with the officer who assigned Costner to his post, I think the characterization is way over-done at times.  A better director could get the point across without having some officer wet his pants.  More profound to me was my second objection about ""Dances with Wolves"".  I was bothered that the solitary male that Costner portrayed could only develop a relationship with another of his own race.  Was Costner afraid to take that step or did it not occur to him that he might have just as easily fallen for a Sioux maiden as a White woman captured years before?  I saw this movie in the theater with my wife, a Native American, and, while times are certainly different now than then, it struck us both that the director was reaching a bit too far.  Probably a minor point to many but I still wrangle over it.

""Dances with Wolves"" was a big hit and justifiably so.  If you haven't seen it, set aside several hours on a quiet evening to enjoy it.  It starts out rather odd but it won't be long before you begin to see what made it an excellent movie.",1127001600,3,2073,4.407894736842105

The two- disc extended edition is presented in a stylish keep case and the personal touch from Kevin Costner and Jim Wilson makes it even more special for every true fan of the movie. Some of the previously deleted scenes benefit the film. For example, the added interactions between John Dunbar and Two Socks make this unusual friendship more believable and the touching moment, when Stands With A Fist cries over her first husband's dead body gives depth to her character. In my opinion, the rest of the deleted scenes are unnecessary. The Major's outburst minutes before he shoots himself, some conversations between Ten Bears and Kicking Bird, and the prolonged preparations of Dunbar's wedding, look and feel somewhat out of place.

Before I finish, I'd like to address all filmmakers. Please, be careful how much of the movie making process you reveal.

The Sioux was well-known for being violent toward white settlers, and while it is NEVER right for men to rape women and kill children---their resentment itself is understandable. For God's sake, the whites came out of nowhere and stole everything out from under them because ""they never paid for it"". There was no need for payment on land that had been their's for thousands of years! But, at the time, apparently the East Coast (which had also been stolen from Natives) wasn't enough, so the U.S. Government went on and robbed the West, too.

While we're on the subject of rape and genocide...how about the U.S. soldiers that massacred Native American reservations in the mid-1870s and '80s? Or earlier than that, when Manifest Destiny began and suddenly there were thousands of white men invading the land and claiming it was their's.

I don't recall ever reading about the government paying for the land, they just took it. Regardless of human life and decency. And it was the same way in the East, back in the late 1830s when President Andrew Jackson ordered the Creeks and the Cherokees and many other tribes to leave so HIS people could have their land. They refused. So he sent SOLDIERS down to herd thousands of men, women, and children from Georgia to Oklahoma. No shelter, ragged clothing, and freezing weather killed not only the Natives, but his own soldiers, too. How can that be justified?

So before we start railing against Kevin Costner for speaking the truth that so many don't want to talk about (although it's greatly praised when people cry about the disgusting slave market in the 1800s), let's remember WHY the Natives were so violent in the first place. If your land was stolen, your women were raped, and your children were killed...don't you think you'd hold a little resentment, too?

That's what I thought.

Now how about YOU shut the hell up?",1123459200,6,2162,4.73404255319149

185189,5,1562550888,"I can appreciate the idea that ""Dances with Wolves"" is an example of cinematic revisionist history, if not an outright case of affirmative action that instantiates the idea of the ""noble savage"" that once held sway among the European settlers of the New World.  But Hollywood has been reinterpreting the Old West in light of changing socio-political beliefs for decades.  Just look at the changing story of Custer at the Little Big Horn from ""Them Died With Their Boots On"" to ""Little Big Man"" to ""Son of the Morning Star.""  With Kevin Costner's film the Western was elevated to a level that hitherto had not been approached in American cinema.

It is ""Little Big Man,"" along with ""A Man Called Horse,"" that are clearly the cinematic ancestors of ""Dances with Wolves.""  All three deal with a white man who finds a home among a Native American tribe, but where this 1990 film differs is that it is also an epic, at which point we are talking ""How the West Was Won"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West.""  Yet ""Dances With Wolves"" is a significant step beyond all of those films.  ""Little Big Man"" was a black comedy and not an epic, ""A Man Called Horse"" was about an English aristocrat and not an American soldier, ""How the West Was Won"" was about Manifest Destiny and not the destruction of an indigenous culture, and ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" was operatic and not grounded in history, albiet a romanticized one.

Michael Blake's screenplay is based on his novel, and it is the film's prologue that I find most problematic.  The idea is to establish Costner's John Dunbar as being someone special from the start, so that the Union soldier who could survive a hail of Confederate bullets becomes the man that could befriend a wild wolf on the Plains.  It is also establishes Dunbar as a man who is searching for something, and not merely an alternative to the horrors of war but more importantly a reason for living.  Whereas the rest of the film takes its time to develop things this initial part is relatively rushed, but the excuse for putting Dunbar in the middle of the Dakotas on a deserted military post is secondary to what happens once he is there.

The greatest strength of ""Dances with Wolves"" is that Dunbar's interactions with the Sioux (really the Lakotas, but the film uses the more familiar but erroneous name for these Native Americans), are defined by a series of relationships with clearly defined characters.  Although his romance with Stands With A Fist (Mary McDonnell) is a major plot line, and her being a white woman raised by the tribe a useful contrivance for allowing the two sides to communicate, the relationship that really stands out is between Dunbar and Kicking Bird (Graham Greene).  This is because the two are kindred spirits, each willing to be open to the other and committed to understanding the other on his own terms.  The opposite position is taken by Wind In His Hair (Rodney A. Grant), but even he forges a relationship with the man who is given the Sioux name Dances With Wolves.

Then there are the relationships with both the tribal elders, such as Chief Ten Bears (Floyd Red Crow Westerman), and the youngsters, including Smiles a Lot (Nathan Lee Chasing His Horse).  What makes these characters so compelling is that they are utterly devoid of caricature and that the performances seem so real and provide such a sense of dignity.  There are moments of warmth and humor throughout the film, both springing from this same source.  It is ironic that while the film won seven Oscars, none of them were for acting (Costner, Greene, and McDonnell were all nominated).

Because Dunbar is all alone at his post, he begins keeping a journal.  This simple device allows the film to take advantage of Dunbar's narration to advance both the story and the message.  What would seem stilted as a monologue works perfectly well in the context of a written journal entry.  In the last act of the film the journal becomes part of the story as well, not only as a symbol of the disdain most white men have for the Indians and their culture, but as a testament to what is being lost.  Dunbar decides to come West because he wants to see it before it is gone (even though the time frame here is the 1860s and the Civil War), and the final point of the film is that the Sioux were only years away from being herded to reservations.  One of the great ironies of the story is that it is Dunbar, the only white man the Sioux have ever known, who gives them their death sentence when he tells them that as many white as there are stars in the sky are coming.

There are two major action sequences in the film, the buffalo hunt and Pawnee attack, but they are really not the most impressive parts of the film.  That Dunbar would be invited to go on the hunt or that he would organize the defense of the village, are ultimately more important in the film.  Dunbar is heroic because he is, in the best meaning of the term, human.  Costner won the Oscar for best director, but clearly his strength is in telling the story and keeping the characters real rather than in coming up with pretty pictures, althought Australian cinematographer Dean Semler comes up with plenty of those, especially when he takes advantage of a brilliant sunset as a backdrop.  ""Dances with Wolves"" is epic in its scope, but it has an attention to detail that few Westerns can rival, which it why it was the first film since ""Cimarron"" in 1931 to win the Best Picture Oscar.",1105747200,16,5473,4.572159672466735
185190,5,1562550888,"The winner of 7 Academy Awards, Kevin Costner's panoramic frontier epic DANCES WITH WOLVES is a rich and masterful blend of scenery, story, culture, personality, and friendship.

Following an act of interpreted bravery in the Civil War, Lt. John Dunbar is restationed to a deserted and delapidated Army fort, somewhere in the vast expanse of the unsettled Dakotas. He soon encounters a local tribe of Sioux Indians. Though initially distrustful, both sides begin to work, however slowly, at conquering their fears and prejudices. As Dunbar grows closer to the community, he makes efforts to learn their ways: language and dress, buffalo hunts and bonfire dances. His developing romance with a tribal woman blossoms into marriage. The Sioux leaders fear, all the while, that more `whites' are coming, to take and drive them off their lands, and the society's holy man suspects that Dunbar himself knows as much. What is more, the U.S. Army has initiated pursuit of the former lieutenant, branding him a traitor. Eventually, Dunbar must choose between remaining with the Sioux ... or departing from their company, rerouting military parties in order to safeguard Sioux culture and life.

The story is strong; the characters are distinctive and transparent; the script, smart and focused. The costumes, setting, transportation and tools-of-the-day all appear very authentic. Thus, it captures the time period (and location) extremely well. And here, it is all the better, because the movie is about those times, and what happened during them. The mood carefully shifts from a somber quality to soft cheeriness to cautious triumphant score, and back again. The film itself makes excellent use of cinematography, with grand, sweeping shots of the plains and hills, especially during the daytime buffalo chase. Unlike so many other Hollywood movies, first-hand acquaintance with ""the girl"" does not turn into romance in a few short days or hours. Nearly everything takes SOME time to develop, to change, to grow.

Costner's depictions seem to be largely accurate: the Sioux and many other indigenous societies in the Midwest and elsewhere were being pushed west, captured, or wiped out. However, he does come close to generalizing the `whites' as senseless, brutal, and enormously characteristically savage, almost like a race of monsters. While in fact various numberless persons - at both common and political levels - perpetrated attrocities and relocation efforts that, sadly, came out of westward expansion's predominant attitude of callous disregard for the native peoples and ecosystems of central North America - it would be inaccurate, as well as unfair, to say that such actions (or even attitudes) constituted phenomena universal to the white settlers.

Yet, on the whole, Costner has done a superb job of recreating the era, the peoples (generally), their ways of life, and the ideologies that motivated their actions. He has brought to life and memory the richness and humanity of a people all but forgotten ... and a partial portrayal of events which made, arguably, for the sadest chapter in the two-hundred-plus years of American history.

This film ranks among the very best Westerns made.

185194,2,1562550888,"The sentimentality that this film oozes is just too much to bear at times. Apparently the American public, who is accustomed to such trifling immodesty, swallowed this up when it was first released and hailed Costner as the ""new genius of American art films"".

Well, since then we've learned two things, that first of all, this film is another foray into the ""John Wayne"" bias of American dogmatism and secondly Costner is a ham who hasn't scored another big hit in years. The film gives us the once again undefiled view of an idealist who was born in the wrong ethic group. Costner plays a Union troop in the Civil War that is merely a ""misunderstood"" progeny and suffers physically and spiritually as a result of it. He gets a new command and like a dim witted simpleton he picks the one that is the furthest from civilization. He soon learns that solitude is not an easy thing. One day he encounters a group of Indians in one of the most ridiculous scenes I have ever seen put forth to a group of adults. The film goes down hill from there and fast. One unrealistic example is when he shows his new Indian friends some ground coffee and they react like dumb founded buffoons, it was a fact in history that the Native Americans ground corn, and other seeds so they would in no way be surprised like this exaggerated claim. Why render them childish?

Costner then becomes a part of the tribe, merely walking into it like a new found brother. He learns the dialect, and sits with the chief while exuding pensive thought. Of course, instead of falling in love with an Indian woman, he falls in love with a captured white who mumbles her way through like a drought minded wench. How convenient that the evil Sioux captured an English speaking woman who is both beautiful and robust! Instead of portraying the Indians in a truthful manner, Costner singlehandedly misinterprets their culture as something bordering on vanity and he does so by extinguishing their intelligence and ability to live in harmony with nature.

Also, the scenes that dealt with the Pawnee were merely used for action sequences and in no way understood the vital role that other tribes had in relation to each other. The only decent portrait is of the stupidity and narrowness of the virulent white people who were shooting at everyone and everything. What more is there to say about this lousy film except that it had no 'truth' about it and it wasn't a loving portrayal as some people claim it to be?",1101945600,16,2473,4.615909090909091

I give Costner a great deal of credit for insisting on using the actual Lakota language rather than having the film all in English as he was pressured to do by Hollywood. Lakota, like many Native languages, is in danger of extinction if more young Lakotas don't take the initiative to learn their language, and this film put that language in the ears of the world.

First of all the movie is racist toward whites.  Kevin Costner seems like the only white man who has sympathy for American Indians.  Costner depicts whites as sloppy, drunk, and incompetent, while depicting the Native Americans as pure, noble, and peaceful.  The settlers who came from Europe did horrible things to the American Indians, but that does not mean the American Indians were all pure at heart and the white man was all evil.

The war and genocide that occurred between the two groups is what almost always happens when two people of different race, religion, and ethnic groups conflict with each other.  Costner was paying respect to the Native Americans and that was a good thing that he did.  The American Indians deserve it up to a point.

185201,5,1562550888,"It's easy to diminish or even forget movies like ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Field of Dreams"" if you on dwell Kevin Costner's poor career moves over the past decade.  It's almost impossible to conceive that the same guy who did ""The Postman"" or ""Waterworld"" was also part of these great films of the late 80s/early 90s (I'd throw ""The Untouchables"" and ""Bull Durham"" in there too).  I don't know where or why Kevin went wrong, but that's no reason to dismiss ""Dances With Wolves"".

I hadn't seen this movie in nearly ten years- not only did I lose respect for and interest in Kevin Costner, but there are just too many movies to see and hardly enough time to watch 3 hour epics that I've already viewed.  Plus, no TV or video tape could really do it justice.  Having recently bought a low-end widescreen TV, however, I've been rewatching a lot of my favorite movies to see what they look like on a bigger, sharper screen, with the correct ratio.  ""Dances With Wolves"" was everything that I remembered, and then some.  As with many movies that I'm rewatching in widescreen, it almost seems as if it's the first time I'm seeing them.

Everything about this movie, even Costner's acting, rings true.  It's a noble, exquisitely detailed and ultimately devastating film.  John Dunbar is a character that fits Kevin's rather flat and bland style perfectly- he's a basic and decent but flawed man who gradually sees the inherent goodness in the people he'd previously only known as faceless and fearsome savages.  He's intelligent and profound, but in a realistic manner befitting a front-line Civil War soldier.  The Sioux are portrayed with complexity and humanity, and without the politically correct patronizing that one might expect from a modern version of history.  They possess qualities that are both foreign and familiar to us.  Like John Dunbar, we take find great pleasure and delight as we slowly learn to connect with them. There's hardly a Native American performer in this movie that didn't deserve an Academy Award.  The noble and dignified nature of Graham Greene's character, who has a terrible inkling of what fate awaits his people, is one of the most heartbreaking performances I've ever seen.  And the scene where Wind In His Hair says farewell to Dances With Wolves by proclaiming him his friend... Well, just keep that box of Kleenex handy.

The production values are also exceptional. John Barry's music, the costumes, the languages, the locations- all combine to give an authentic, genuine feel to a genre that is often dragged down by cliches and a Hollywoodized feel.  It's sad to think that if this film were made today, it would be done with flat, unrealistic looking computer generated images.  Imagine the buffalo hunt or the landscapes rendered with a computer in the hands of a misguided filmmaker who believes that technology has more value than organic, living scenes.  Hard as it is to believe, ""Dances With Wolves"" could not have been made to the same effect in the 21st Century.

The four hour extended version of the movie expands on already well-developed scenes and characters.  I haven't seen it recently enough to know for certain what has been added from the original version, but this one struck me as having even more depth and detail.  Of note is a scene where the Sioux celebrate the massacre of the buffalo hunters responsible for the wasteful slaughter of the bison herd, thereby casting some doubt to Dunbar over his new friends.  An amazing scene that casts the characters in a different light- both the Indians and the white men are flawed human beings, who invoke neither complete sympathy nor total derision.  Four hours is an incredible investment for a movie, but it holds up well viewed over several sittings.  Combine that with two separate commentaries and several documentaries, and you have a very worthwhile DVD set with plenty of rewatchability.

Video quality is breathtaking at times, but some secenes, especially those at night, are a bit foggy and grainy.  Sound quality is good, but doesn't have quite the depth or power in 5.1 that I would have expected.  Still, the technical aspects of the DVD are more than acceptable and sometimes nearly perfect.

""Dances With Wolves"" is truly one of our greatest American films.  The emotional impact still resounds, and its messages are timeless and even timely in an age where America's place in other cultures is under question.  If Kevin Costner never makes a good film again in his life, he will have more than earned his place as one of the greats with the love and labor he put into this fine film.",1092009600,10,4606,4.842911877394636
185202,5,1562550888,"Dances with Wolves easily earns a position among the all-time-greatest epic motion pictures. Its story and presentation are fresh, honest, real and breathtaking. ""Epic"" implies the film takes longer to tell its story than the average movie, and that it does. But consider that the correct measure of the length of any film is to track the number of visits your eyes make to your watch during the film. Thus a three-hour movie may seem shorter than a ninety-minute movie. The character development and interaction of this movie invites us to participate, to be there and feel as our hearts share the emotions of characters even as we feel the pleasure from the eye candy provided by the amazing cinematography that takes us across the massive Northern Plaines of the United States. The movie begins in a dramatic scene in which, Kevin Costner, a lieutenant in the Union Army, crawls off the battlefield surgeons table to save his badly injured leg or foot from amputation. Somewhat delirious he takes actions that lead to victory for his troops and ends a deadly stalemate between the two armies. As the hero of the battle the general's surgeon heals his leg and the lieutenant is offered any post he wants. He chooses the most remote post the army has because he wants to see the unspoiled land before it's too late, and the real story begins. A caution to those who think the white man was portrayed unfairly; read unbiased history, then watch the movie again. This movie undertakes allot and it succeeds. This exciting action, drama, western, love-story shows us a great example of a film that can be so absolutely entertaining and educational at the same time. Dances with Wolves entertains as it shows through historical example the importance and consequences of learning about our own preconceptions and learning the potential benefit we may enjoy from learning to respect and accept other beliefs or points of view, to just learning to understand all that we can before making decisions and drawing conclusions in any matter.
Dances with Wolves does all that any movie could be asked to do.",1089504000,,2097,4.8767507002801125

There is no real lie in ""Dances"" that I can see, but it does seem stylized. The Indians are pictured as peaceful, spiritual conservers of the land. Real-life Indians had every potential of being violent savages without anybody's prompting. Just ask the Mexicans who were systematically robbed by them every harvest until American mountain men with guns were recruited to provide a little security. The soldiers are dumbellionites, as are most of the whites that Kevin Costner ""escapes"" from in his effort to find the real West. While Indians certainly knew how to preserve the land, an act of necessity for them, they took plenty from it without replenishment. Whites stripped and mined the land, but they also came up with ingenious technologies that re-generated the land.

185204,5,1562550888,"Whether Kevin Costner likes it or not, his career will be inexorably tied to this masterpiece of cinematography. Written as a novel basically just for this film's screenplay by Michael Blake, this is a journey for all ages to see. There are attempts to validate the accuracy of the history or intention of this movie. I believe it would be missing the point. There are no villains or heroes (though Dunbar may be tried to be portrayed in such a light), just a view of how people of a different ethos try to survive amongst each other where suspicions and distrust run high.
As an actor, this is Kevin at his best. Though solid in 'Open Range', Dance With Wolves gave Costner more of a spectrum of emotion to handle. He dealt with many situations here with a believable sense of drama. I do have one tiny detail with his character. He speaks his narration like he is proof-reading his junior-high school essay. Very flat and monotone. But maybe it done that way to enhance the onscreen action. Who knows?
An intregal element to the movie was to cast exactly the right people to support the film. And no film in recent memory in my opinion handled that privilege better than here. Everyone from Kicking Bird, Stands With a Fist, Wind in His Hair right down to characters such as Smiles-A-Lot, Corporal Spivey and Black Shawl performed without flaw. The script enabled everyone to let their roles come alive.
The extended scenes not in the original release, while not essential, do heighten what Blake tried to get across in the story. More importantly, I did not feel the movie dragging with the additions. I like to think of it as more movie for the dollar.
The extras on the DVD are standard fare and do not penalize one's interest in the film's production. The people interviewed were frank and fun to listen to. So go ahead and pick up Dances With Wolves. It's a well-paced movie that lets a spare four hours go by regretlessly.",1086220800,3,1930,4.597101449275362
185205,5,1562550888,"Kevin Costner may have made some movie duds, but he makes of for it in sensational movies.  Dances with Wolves is one of my most favorite films of all time.  It is so sad.  It makes you feel bad for settling in America.  The film has great perfomances throughout the entire film.  The plot takes you into another world. The cinematography is also some of the most beautiful I have ever seen.  The realism of the indian tribe and the way people lived in the 1800s is wonderful.  Everyone should see this movie at some time in their lifetime, I highly reccomend it.",1083888000,3,563,4.407766990291262
185206,2,1562550888,"When you watch the run of the arrow of Samuel Fuller, you'll know why this a adaptation of that one, but without its force.
I didn't have notice of Fuller's movie till I read a long interview in 1996 in a Spanish magazine called Nosferatu, in which Mr. Fuller complainted around the special fact that Dances was a light reading of the run of the arrow.
But we know what happened with Samuel Fuller.
I think Mr. Costner who undoubtly is very original with the use of the camera, seems to carry by the safe road of a tearful movie, in a clear searching of touching the soul and heart of the viewer. The excess of romanticism about an outlaw who decides to rebel against the rules.
There're too many elemental situations close to clich, the story is too predictable than you'll be wondering why this movie won so many Academy awards if you compare with deepest and ambicious films , like The searchers, The naked spur, Ride the high country, Rio bravo, The man of the west, The life and times of judge Roy Bean, Sundance kid, Johnny guitar, The treasure of Sierra Madre, The wild bunch, The ballad of cable Hogue, Once upon a time in the west, or Tombstone (the best western in the last decade) to mention just a few.
Don't forget that the western is the mithology of the american cinema. So having this statement in mind, it`s difficult conciliate the anti-hero figure and accept it like political correct.
Thanks God that Mr. Costner thought a lot about that point and with his new film Open Range, he inscribed this film as the best western in this new century. I'm very glad about that. Because like Robert Refford and Clint Eastwood, Costner will be better remembered as director instead a standard actor And don't surprise if this new film is not so recognized like Dances, because it's too hard that another western be prized again by the Academy. It would be a record, considering that the Unforgiven won an Oscar by the best picture in 1992.
The fact that four films like Dances with wolves, Unforgiven, Forrest Gump, American beauty,have been rewarding with the Oscar in just  the last decade is a point that deserves an apart mention. But if you turn your attention in films like Patton, Braveheart and Gladiator, (winners too) you'll understand that there's something in the air.",1083110400,6,2288,4.635467980295567

185208,5,1562550888,"I saw Dances With Wolves at the theatre in 1990 and have always counted it as one of my favorite films.
As I began building my DVD collection, I considered it a ""must have."" But, I really hesitated buying the Special Extended Edition because a lot of reviewers had stated that the DVD was ""overly long"" and that the extended scenes had really hurt the content of the film.
Well, in my opinion, these critics are dead wrong. The special edition is every bit as beautiful and stirring as the original release. Yes, the pace of the film is slow, but never boring or dull. There is so much for the viewer to just sit back and take in.
And I wonder how many of those who complained about the movie's four hour length have ever sat through a 4-6 hour mini-series, plus commercials. My advice - view longer films over 2-3 nights, take your time and enjoy an epic such as Dances.
I highly recommend this version. It's a real shame that Kevin Costner's run at the top was so short. In a span of only a few years, he gave us The Untouchables, Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, and of course, his masterpiece, Dances With Wolves. We have all heard enough Waterworld jokes, so I will refrain. Who knows, maybe some day soon, KC will find that cinema magic once again.",1081900800,5,1251,4.373390557939914

185211,5,1562550888,"Granted, the movie has it's inaccuracies. By the time of the civil war actual war between Whites and Lakotas had been raging for a decade already. Although Lnt. Dunbar's Winchester rifle wouldn't be developed until 10 years after the time frame of the movie, the Lakota did already have guns. However, the mayority still hunted and fought with bow and arrow. The Lakota had been trading with whites for at least two generations already and therefore had a lot of trade items when the film suggests otherwise. Granted.
But what makes this film outstanding is that it lets the Lakota speak mainly for themselves, in their own language, neither in Tonto-speak suggesting an IQ below room temperature nor in english spoken backwards as in so many other distortive Hollywod films about Indians. Sure, the main character is not Indian, it is Dunbar who lets the predominantly white audience discover the Lakota through white eyes. I wonder when we will see a film which doesn't rely any more on this crutch of culture mediation. Its Lorence of Arabia on the plains. Similar to the dramaturgy of ""The Man they called Horse"", the Lakota seem to have waited for Dunbar to lead them to success. But without that element there wouldn't have been any room for Costner in the cast ;)
There are quite a lot of people who resented this film for being PC propaganda. GA Custer buffs and John Wayne fans have come to talk of ""revisionist"" Hollywood propaganda painting an overly saintly picture of Indians.
I disagree. This is just one of a handful of films which portrays Indians not as the ""bad guys"" posing as pop-up targets for the glorious cavalry but as what they really were: members of a colorful, close-to-nature culture that was mercilessly crushed out of greed and race hate. Let's face it, whites who travelled to the west or joined the army had been fed since early childhood days with abduction and torture tales, the first and most prevalent category of truly American literature. That the ""indian savages, the red devils"" had to be exterminated could be read in countless books and newspaper articles and would be reiterated by congressmen and Presidents from Jefferson down to Roosevelt a century later.
Some people objected to the whites being often depicted as filthy as opposed to cleanly indians. Well, whites on the frontier mostly had a proper bath once a week and many maybe once a month. Indians bathed every day in the next river, they just had a different attitude to the body than christian whites of that period ;)
It is also not correct that the element of violence in Lakota culture is completely blended out. At the band meeting when the Lakota people discuss how to react to Dunbar's presence Wind-in-his-hair suggests to shoot a few arrows into the white stranger in order to set straight who is boss. Strangers on the prairy were mostly considered enemies until circumstances proved otherwise. The movie doesn't gloss over this at all. Later on, enraged by the sight of slaughtered buffalo herds left to rot in the sun by white hunters, the Lakota track down the hunters, butcher and skalp them. At night the whole village rejoices in a scalp dance. Dunbar feels repelled and realizes that a huge cultural chasm separates him from his new friends. Is this PC? I don't think so. What Wind-in-his-hair was not allowed to do is later accomplished by the Pawnees: they kill and scalp Dunbar's stagecoach driver on his way back. A warrior is nothing without war and enemies to overcome, this basic rule of plains cultures is also part of the colorful mixed bag Costner presents to us.
The huge merit of this film is that it gives a very authentic picture of indian life, actually how it used to be a few decades prior to the civil war. The movie leaps across the division line of ""us vs. them"" and views the ""clash of cultures"" from the native side. Most of the soldiers Dunbar is confronted with after returning to his post are absorbed with hate and contempt of the ""injuns"". This characterization is unflattering but, sadly, most accurate. The movie portrays whites essentially through indian eyes. Is this imbalanced? Well, we all have seen hundreds of traditional westerns where it was the other way around. This latter movie helps to create a sort of balance in our minds which has been so sorely lacking previously.
Someone here suggested watching Bruce Beresford's ""Black Robe"" (1991) instead for ""a balanced representation of the clash of two disparate cultures"". My advice: do so if you think that whites only came as missionaries instead of soldiers, that whites do upper-class house music whereas indians do it all day and night doggy-style in the dirt, that matriarchaic democratic Iroquois communities are in reality under male dictatorship and that captive women and children are tortured to death instead of being adopted into the tribe and that the same fate awaits white captives although they just passed the initiation ritual of the gauntlet etc. Oh yes, and if you think that Mohawk people speak Cree instead of Mohawk ;)
Now for real, see Dances and Little Big Man and maybe Soldier Blue if you want to know what Sand Creek was like and have an itch to have Saving Private Ryan topped in terms of carnage (uncut version, only availlable outside the US). The rest is white history distortion to the bone, not history.",1076630400,12,5351,4.811074918566775
185212,5,1562550888,"This movie is a classic in the making. The story clearly details how the US minipulated and persecuted the indians.

After befriending and marrying an indian woman, he is welcomed into the tribe and quickly forgets the murderous tails told of the indians. In the end, of which I will not ruin, you tend to see the story from a different perspective and quickly relate to the emotions one man can feel when drawn into such a dramatic situation.",1076371200,,601,4.472727272727273

185214,5,1562550888,"This was a second viewing for me. I saw it a few years ago, loved it then, love it now.
In my opinion, Costner's depiction of how things were between Indians and White Men was true to form. I tend to like books and movies that show both sides of the coin, so to speak, and this movie did so.
Yes, the behaviour of the white men was over-played; surely all white people aren't that mean. But you have to figure, at that time the kind of men we see portrayed in that movie were products of their own time.
The timeline the movie is set in, isn't your modern-day world where everyone is careful about what they say and how they view other races of people.
That is how a lot of people reacted to native people. There were bad guys on our side too.
Something I liked about this movie was that women were not shown as being second-rate members of the tribe. They were treated decently and respected. We can well imagine there were some groups who did not treat their women well, but we can also imagine there were white men who also abused women.
I was impressed with the extra coverage that came with our DVD set. I was surprised to know that the cast went to the trouble of learning the language of the D'akota. And I was surprised to know that not all native people know how to speak the ancient languages.
One of the most poignant scenes in the movie is when Kevin Costner gets the wolf to take meat from his hand. It was very sad when the wolf was shot.
I cannot think of any parts of this movie that did not hold my interest.
I am so impressed by the movie, that I have ordered the book, and the audio version of the original novel.

185219,5,1562550888,"OK, this movie isn't a religious experience or anything, though it came awfully close when I saw it back in '91. ""Dances With Wolves"" was, at that time, the most amazing thing I'd ever seen. Ever. Its leisurely pace, the subtitles, the wide-open spaces, the landscapes ... the physical aspects alone of this movie were enough to turn my head completely around. To say nothing of the score, the photography, the writing, the characters, the acting, and Kevin Costner's lovely, skillful, controlled direction. To me, it was the be-all, end-all.
I still love ""Dances."" Revisionists are now saying that Costner's great film is too slow, too self-important, too benign, too whatever. I'm not real big on the idea that there's this huge jealousy factor at work against Kevin Costner, but in this respect, I'd have to say that people just seem to have something against the man, and they seem to begrudge him even ""Dances With Wolves.""
No matter. This is one of the best movies of the 1990s (or, I guess, late 1980s). It was obviously inspired by the great epics of the past (not the least ""Lawrence of Arabia"") and paved the way for ""Unforgiven"" and ""Braveheart."" Costner stumbled with ""The Postman,"" and has made more than his share of terrible movies, but he's got the goods as a director.

You won't regret watching the extended version.  All I could say after watching it was --- make it longer, make it longer!  I wish they would put out the actual ENTIRE movie the way Kevin Costner intended when it was made. I would watch the entire thing - I don't care how long it is.",1064707200,5,600,4.418181818181818
185221,5,1562550888,"I recently saw Open Range which shares much in common with this film. Both have an unhurried pace, often dwell on what seem to be insignificant details (but which prove significant later), and both make effective use of the setting in which most of the action occurs. This is Kevin Costner's style as director, one which is especially effective in this film. It was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and received seven, including those for best film, director (Costner), cinematography (Dean Semler), adapted screenplay, editing, and sound. There are two essential conflicts in the plot, one which is cultural and another which involves the Lakota Sioux and their hated enemies, the Pawnee. The former was the inevitable result of westward expansion which eventually eliminated most of the Native Americans who opposed it; the latter existed long before that expansion accelerated following the Civil War. This film has a peculiar beginning: Lieutenant John Dunbar (Costner) seems determined to commit suicide as his Union associates face Confederate troops. During a lull, he races his horse across the field which divides them and is seriously wounded. His behavior is viewed as heroism because it inspires what becomes a victory for the Union troops. Later, after he recovers, he requests assignment to a military outpost in South Dakota. The clear implication is that he wants to get as far away as he can from ""civilization."" Upon arrival, he find the outpost abandoned. The supplies are unloaded and then he is alone, except for his horse and a curious but cautious wolf which observes him from a distance. Through a series of events, he later becomes involved with a Lakota Sioux tribe and a personal transition then begins which....
It would be a disservice to those who have not as yet seen this film to say any more about the plot. Suffice to say that there is a great deal of sometimes violent action which Costner (as director) brilliantly juxtaposes with moments of exquisite tenderness and deep reflection. All of the performances are outstanding. One of the strongest is provided by Mary McDonnell (Stands with a Fist), a white woman and recent widow who has lived most of her life among the Lakota. I especially enjoyed Wes Studi's work in this film as the Toughest Pawnee, (as well as in The Last of the Mohicans as Magua) and Graham Greene's performance as Kicking Bird, Stands with a Fist's surrogate father. Some of the most effective photography recreates a buffalo hunt during which Dunbar helps his friends and neighbors to obtain the food and hides they need before the arrival of winter. There is also an especially well-staged attack on the Lakota camp by the Pawnee in which Dunbar also plays a key role. The ""civilization"" he rejected eventually follows him westward, forcing him to make a predictable choice. Dunbar's assimilation reminds me of one experienced by John Blackthorne (Richard Chamberlain) in Shogun following his immersion in 17th century Japanese culture. By the time a choice had to be made, neither hesitated and each made his decision for reasons which reveal so much about the new values to which each is committed. Some have criticized this film for being so obviously sympathetic with the Lakota and so critical of the society from which Dunbar fled. They have a point. It is important to remember, however, that Costner is telling the story from a specific point-of-view. He selected historical material which gives his film a degree of authenticity, to be sure, but whose greater purpose is to expedite as well as enrich the narrative. He, his cast, and crew should be very proud of what they achieved together: a thoroughly entertaining film of a very high quality.
Be sure to purchase the Special Edition DVD which offers so many supplementary items which include commentaries by Kevin Costner, producer Jim Wilson, director of photography Dean Semler and editor Neil Travis, a new extended version with never-before-seen additional scenes (236 minutes), and a new ""The Creation of an Epic"" retrospective documentary.",1063670400,5,4069,5.056547619047619

I realized what my father's generation must have felt like when they saw Lawrence of Arabia for the first time. The sheer majesty of this film is incredible and it's one that helped brought back the epic motion picture.
With the new DVD you get an extra hour of film and all of it is worth watching. There is more character development, shots of vistas that must have bought tears to the eyes when it did not make the first cut, and what really happened the soldiers that abandoned Fort Sedgewick. The picture quality was good and it does not take away from the film, but I agree with other critics when they say they were expecting something a little bit more vibrant coming from the DVD. Especially when MGM has done wonders when rereleasing their eye-popping musicals.
The behind the scenes documentary the typically formatted but very good. Fans will enjoy. The feature that the was most unneccessary was the introduction to the photo gallery. The Photos are great, however Ben Glass comes out with his dog and reads from a contrived script, making this feature very schmaltzy.
The feature I did enjoy most was the Costner/Wilson commentary. Very informative and worth listening to. Costner bounces between being self absorbed to being very gracious. But they manage to stick to the point as the movie plays. It's obvious that Costner and Wilson love this film. Points also go to them talking about the many names of the that appear on the end credits and where their careers went with as much emphasis as they did with the actors and film crew. Very classy.

The included documentary is also something special for those who truly love this movie.  However, since I own both the original DVD release and the new Special Edition, I have noticed one minor flaw.  The color in many of the scenes on the Special Edition DVD appear washed out or faded when compared to the original.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the Badlands scene.  The colors on the original DVD were bright and vivid, while those on the Special Edition were relatively dull and pale.  While this fault is not enough to keep me from recommending the purchase of this DVD, it does raise an interesting question.

185224,5,1562550888,"This is a stunning motion picture and worthy of all the accolades and awards (7 academy awards..!!) it received.
It's ironic that Costner had difficulty finding financial backing for this film as it belonged to a genre that was considered out of ""cinematic fashion"". Not only did this film dispel such nonsense, but a year later, Clint Eastwood's brilliant ""Unforgiven"" also garnered the Oscar for Best Motion Picture.
Dances with Wolves tells the story of John Dunbar, a dissillusioned Civil War ""hero"" who wants to see the frontier ""before it disappears.
Dunbar quickly makes a home for himself in a deserted and forgotten fort on a quiet sandy area on the plains, where he prefers the company of his horse and nature to the harshness of the civil war, which is continuing to rage back east.
In time, Dunbar meets his ""neighbours"" - the plains tribe, the Sioux - and it is the interaction and relationships which develop between this soldier and the Sioux, which propels this movie to greatness. It is interesting to see the difference in the relationship between Dundar and Winds-In-His-Hair, the warrior, who wants nothing to do with the ""white intruders"" on his land. However, the ""holy man"" of the tribe, Kicking Bird, looks at Dunbar with a sense of curiousity and ""sadness (he understands that more white men will eventually come to settle their land) and over time, establishes a very special relationship with him.
Dances With Wolves works on so many levels that it's not at all surprising that the film was both an artistic and commercial success.
You have a rousing adventure film with battles and a buffalo hunt that is absolutely breathtaking in its realism. The scenes are so well depicted that you almost have the sensation of riding at a breakneck pace along side the thundering herd.
Of course, there's a romance element as Dunbar falls in love with Stands-With-Fist, the adopted daughter of Kicking Bird, who has recently lost her husband.
You have to admire the integrity and guts that Costner showed in making a film in a genre that was essentially dead. It's doubtful that he would have found the money if this film hadn't come on the heels of The Untouchables and Field of Dreams, for example, which had secured his reputation in Hollywood at the time as a major bankable star.
This film was made at the height of Costner's popularity and turkeys like Waterworld, 3000 Miles To Graceland and The Postman were still far off in the future.
However, notwithstanding the above, if Costner never did another thing in Hollywood, he can look back on this epic film that he was primarily responsible for and be very, very proud.",1059868800,3,2643,4.836644591611479

Kevin Costner turns in a fine performance as a Civil War cavalry hero who is posted to the Western Frontier, and by accident is assigned to an abandoned outpost by a deranged commander. Alone and isolated from the Army, Costner eventually becomes first acquainted with, then absorbed by, the local Lakota Sioux tribe. Although the storyline sounds simple, this is in fact a complex story with many dimensions.

The film's greatest success is its portrayal of the Sioux as ordinary human beings in a highly complex and civilized society, albeit one very unlike our own. The Sioux are shown to be a brave, compassionate, friendly people, although possessed of a warlike tradition and culture.

The cinematography of the film is superb, and it wonderfully captures the size and grandeur of the American west. The picture is crisp and the scenes are vivid. There are no phony looking sets of the type that often plagues Western films. As if this were not enough, this film contains one of the best musical scores I've ever heard. ""Looks Like a Suicide,"" the main musical score of the film, is wonderful.

Unfortunately, this film has two very serious flaws that caused me to deprive it of a ""five stars"" rating. It is far, far too long. I like the film enough so that I admit that I enjoy the length, but there is no doubt in my mind at least that this film could and should have been shorter--this would not have decreased its impact.

The second flaw is that, as the Amazon editorial review says, the scene when the American soldiers return is simply overdone. It is OK to villainize them; history suggests that this is at not undeserved. But it could have been done in a less extreme fashion--the way it was done caused the whole scene to seem one dimensional, and not particularly enjoyable, at least to me.

The Special Edition DVD is the one to get. The ""deleted scenes"" that it includes are some of the better ones; I would say that this suggests that the one big flaw in this film is the editing--the regular version excluded some good scenes and included some scenes that seem to simply constitute filler. Well, opinions may differ. The audio commentaries are interesting, although I admit I have not yet listened to them all and may never do so.

All in all, there is a tremendous amount to like in this film, and most film afficianados will enjoy this DVD thoroughly. The DVD format is great for this film, because of course it makes it possible to watch it in several sittings. At 237 minutes, that is almost a must for most of us.",1057104000,,2588,4.6152173913043475
185228,5,1562550888,"I have just finished watching Dances With Wolves for the first time, and I have to say it is one of my favorite movies of all time, after one viewing.
  The movie absolutely captivated me with it's sense of wildness and freedom. I never imagined that I would feel this engrossed in a 3+ hour movie, but I indeed did sit there thru the entire thing, totally absorbed in the storyline.
  The movie was packed with extraordinary scenery and a flawless portrayal of the horse people of the plains.
  The ending was tragic, but true, and I feel even more for the native cultures that once peopled our land, and treated it as it should be treated.
  I am sure most of the folks reading this review have already seen the movie at one time or another, so I must say that this long awaited DVD was worth the wait. The picture was excellent, as was the audio.

185229,5,1562550888,"To borrow an old cliche, ""Dances With Wolves"" isn't a cup of tea everyone will enjoy.
The naysayers will usher out the usual complaints: Too long... Too slow... Subtitles... Blah, blah, blah...
But this cup of tea is meant to be sipped and savored, not guzzled.
I already had the special edition on VHS, and I held out buying the film's DVD until now. The special edition ""Dances With Wolves"" is a prized addition to my DVD collection.
This is a rare ""extended version"" of a film in that the added scenes truly add to the story and enhance the movie-watching experience. Yes, this edition of ""Dances With Wolves"" is longer, but it is also better.
Among the extra scenes, one stands out. It depicts the Sioux's brutal, some would even dare say ""savage"" side as they essentially dismember the white hunters who slaughtered bisons for their hids but let the meat rot. (We see the aftermath of what the tribe's warriors did to the hunters, not the actual killings.)
All the extra footage blends well with the original ""Dances With Wolves."" This film has seamless editing, and I actually like how the time is taken to let the story unfold slowly. Too many movies seem rushed to me -- and I, in turn, feel rushed watching them.
""Dances With Wolves"" gives you quiet moments to absorb the information and enjoy the absolutely majestic cinematography as the story develops.
Let me also list the accolades most commonly associated with this Best Picture winner -- by those who agree it is a masterful epic: Authentic acting, glorious images and great, old-fashion story telling. And don't forget the score. The music is a perfect match for the film, and contributes greatly to settng the mood.
Then there's that buffalo hunt scene, widely considered ""Dances With Wolves"" most rousing moment. It truly is among the most impressive five minutes ever captured on film, especially as you realize these big beasts are the ""real deal.""
Today, directors would resort to digital animation. We are actually seeing a herd of 3,000 snorting bisons rambling across the prairie and a genuine reenactment of a Sioux buffalo hunt. Amazing!
Finally, I found the featurettes on Disc 2 superior to the general Making Of... fluff tacked onto most DVDs. These ""Dances With Wolves"" documentaries are done in retrospect, 12 years removed from when the film was actually made, as Kevin Costner and practically all the other principals associated with the film look back on the film-making experience.
They all seem to realize, with great pride, ""Dances With Wolves"" is their crowning achievement. This movie was also obviously a labor of love for all involved, and it shows.",1055635200,,2641,4.8841870824053455

I have owned four different versions of this release... two on VHS (the original and extended-length versions), and two on DVD (the original DTS version and this new release).
PICTURE:  While some scenes on this new DVD are absolutely stunning visually, it appears to me that about 1/4 of the scenes have very lackluster color.  This effect is very noticable.  Spectacular blue skies and vibrant green grasses in some scenes are followed by others that appear as if someone turned down the colors on my television set (I am using a Denon 2800II DVD player and a Samsung HLN-507W DLP HDTV).
SOUND:  The original DTS version of the film sounded better than this one.  My reference scene (and the one I use to demo my home theater to friends) is of course the buffalo hunt.  The DTS version sounded crisper and more detailed... I found this Dolby Digital version somewhat muddier.
This DVD is still a must-own for fans of the movie.  I'm just disappointed that it didn't receive the video and audio treatments it deserved.  Many DVDs are released in both the Dolby Digital and DTS audio formats... why wasn't this one?",1053907200,30,1229,4.732394366197183

The original DVD is now out of print, and has been for some year or two now. When I heard that, I was shocked. This is one of the best films ever made, and at least with this one, the 'powers that be' took notice, and gave it 7 oscars. This is an epic of a film that sees John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) during the US civil war. He's given his choice of assignments, so he chooses Ft. Sedgewick, ""the westernmost fort in the realm"". He arrives to find it deserted.
Dunbar begins interacting with the local Sioux indians in what is some of the best film ever shot. The characters are rich and full of life, and the indian culture is portrayed as both beautiful and violent. This film shows a different side of the indians than most other films, a very refreshing side.
This DVD set contains TONS of extras, more than I could describe here. They are well worth the extra price, and make a great addition to the film. The added hour of footage gives more insight into the characters and really make this film better believe it or not. The scenes were originally cut for obvious film-length reasons.
All that said, I feel that this film is one of the best movies ever made, and that everyone should watch it at least once. I think it gives a bit of insight into the plight of the native americans, and shows us how their culture existed in harmony with nature before Europeans came. There are many messages in this film.

And then the extras, the features about how the film was produced will simply send you on a cinematic and emotional trek. NEVER have I been so awed by the style, technique and commitment to a project, NEVER.
Kevin Costner, for all of his flops that followed this epic, deserves to be noted as a premiere filmmaker with Dances With Wolves. Never again I believe shall we see such heart, such gentle yet realistic portrayals of how this country once was. He will always be the master director and brilliant actor beyond the other movies he has made.

185237,4,1562550888,"""Dances With Wolves"" is the epic, revisionist western directed by and starring Kevin Costner.  In scope and size, this is one galliant, masterfully directed motion picture and the well-deserving recipient of 9 Academy Awards.  PLOT: After surviving a suicide charge on the field of honor, Major John Dunbar travels to the west, establishing a life-long friendship with the Sioux Indians.
Originally running nearly three hours in theaters, a full hour of footage was excised to keep the already elephantine running time manageable.  For years, on VHS and DVD, only the theatrical cut of this film has been made available, though Image laserdisc did release the full 3 hr. 58 min. version in a deluxe box set back in the mid-1990's.  That fully restored running time is finally given the full digital treatment via this DVD release.  Too lengthy to fit on one side of a DVD, MGM has spread the feature film over two sides on the first disc.  Since no intermission was ever intended, the cut comes about midway through and is obtrusive to your viewing experience.  However, as there is no other way to ensure the intregity of compression artifacts, this cut is, if not forgiveable, at least palpable.
MGM DVD has done a very nice job on remastering ""Dances With Wolves"".  The original DVD from Image Entertainment had deeper contrast and black levels, but adjusting the contrast on one's television corrects the softer levels on this disc.  Shadow delineation is beautifully rendered.  Colors are vibrant, bold and accurate.  Some minor edge enhancement occurs but shimmering and pixelization are at a bare minimum. The audio is 5.1 and pretty much the same mix as the original Image DVD.
EXTRAS: Audio commentaries that are, for the most part, interesting, an all-new production featurette, the original featurette and a host of other well-meaning, though rather lack luster extras that have merely been designed to fill up space on disc #2.  I must also give MGM less than top marks for their packaging. After the handsomely bound ""West Side Story"" special edition I was perhaps expecting too much to think that, even though a leather bound case would be out of the question for ""Dances With Wolves"", at the very least we'd get something stronger in faux leather (like the ""Pearl Harbor"" disc packaging) than the flimsy, barely cardboard, shell we do get  with its Velcro snapper.  Taaa-cky!
BOTTOM LINE: This is the definitive version of ""Dances With Wolves"".  It is the way Costner and his production team intended you to experience the movie and it is most definitely worth every penny to buy.  Enjoy!",1053388800,44,2603,4.9631336405529956

185240,5,1562550888,"Kevin Costner directed, produced and starred in the 1990 western epic ""Dances with Wolves"", which was based upon the novel of the same name by author Michael Blake, who also wrote the film's screenplay.  Costner plays U.S. Army Lieutenant John G. Dunbar during and shortly after the U.S. Civil War.  Following a victory with Union troops under his command, he requests an assignment to the western frontier and is assigned to an isolated military outpost in the Dakota Territory.  John waits patiently for other troops to arrive at the outpost, but they never do.  With no means to communicate with his superiors, John bides his time by taking care of the outpost and himself, as well as writing in his journal.  A nearby wolf begins to take an interest in John.  At first, he tries to chase the wolf away, but eventually, the wolf becomes John's unwitting companion.  Later, John realizes that there is a nearby Native American Sioux tribe.  Members of the tribe meet John, but since they do not have a common language to speak with one another, they are somewhat suspicious of him.  Later, they invite John to visit their encampment where he sees a Caucasian woman (Mary McDonnell) living with them.  She remembers a little English is able to talk with him and tells him that her name is Stands With A Fist.  Eventually, John learns how to speak Sioux and is adopted by the tribe after he helps them.
Originally released at 183 minutes (three hours), the film may seem long; but the characters, story and cinematography keep most viewers fully engaged.  The extended director's version is even longer at 236 minutes (four hours).  The primary Sioux characters are Kicking Bird (Graham Greene, whose career in film was boosted greatly by this film), Wind in His Hair (Rodney A. Grant), the elder Ten Bears (Floyd 'Red Crow' Westerman) and Black Shawl (Tantoo Cardinal).  The film won seven Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director (Kevin Costner), Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Music, Best Sound and Best Writing--Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium (Michael Blake).  Kevin Costner received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, Graham Greene was nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Mary McDonnell was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.
Overall, I rate ""Dances with Wolves"" with 5 out of 5 stars not only for being a very engaging film, but also for its very positive portrayal of Native American life in the former western frontier.  Some people may find the film too long, some may be offended by the negative portrayal of U.S. Army soldiers and some may be offended by the negative portrayal of Pawnee tribespeople. Unfortuneately, none of Costner's works following ""Dances with Wolves"" have been as good.  Films that Costner only starred in such as ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" (1991), ""A Perfect World"" (1993) and ""Wyatt Earp"" (1994) were entertaining; but films that he both starred in and directed were box office disasters: ""Waterworld"" (1995) and ""The Postman"" (1997).  Perhaps his next directorial work (that he also stars in) will be better: ""Open Range"", slated for release in May, 2003.",1050537600,244,3136,4.998076923076923

185245,3,1562550888,"DANCES WITH WOLVES is a tale of two movies.  The first film is a moving, epic story about Lt. John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) who accepts a post at a remote fort in the Dakotas and turns out to be the only soldier there.  He befriends first, a wolf, then his nearest neighbors, a Lakota Sioux tribe.  Both friendships are tentative at the outset, yet succeed and are nurtured through trust.  It is a beautiful, wonderful story.
But then comes the second movie.  The evil white man descends upon Dunbar's abandoned fort and systematically, demonically, begins to destroy and kill.  This movie provides no insight into such wanton cruelty; it only portrays it, over and over (even to the point of showing a group of soldiers getting their kicks shooting Two Socks, Dunbar's befriended wolf).  Fortunately, Dunbar is able to escape such evil, with the aid of his Sioux brothers, and thus assimilate back into the Indian culture.
Accordingly, a wonderful film is ruined by political correctness.  We are given a complete, warm potrayal of the collectivist society of the Lakotas--both pros and cons.  But no such treatment is given of the plains soldiers who fought the Indians; they are portrayed as ruthless, cutthroat killers, and because of the one-dimensional depiction the ending of this film disintegrates into bitter disappointment.  DANCES WITH WOLVES is a moving, well-made film, but a lack of point of view balance makes the movie fall well short of the mark.",1046131200,26,1462,4.954918032786885

He wasn't trying to be anyone, and he let the Native Americans shine in this epic revisionist Western.  Graham Greene was superb, as were most of the native cast.  I got the sense that Costner took a new spin on ""The Searchers,"" in which John Wayne played a disenchanted Confederate soldier who found himself out west.

Dunbar is assigned to an outpost in the Dakotas during the 1870's.  Along the way he meets some interesting characters, but its after he sets up his post that the story begins.
Lt. Dunbar meets members of Sioux Tribe and tries to develop a friendship with them.  They struggle with communication until Stands With a Fist (Mary McDonnell) is asked to interpret for them.  With her help Lt. Dunbar is able to learn about the indian ways from Kicking Bird (Graham Green II) and in return tell him about the coming of the white man.  Lt. Dunbar comes to respect Wind in His Hair (Rodney A. Grant) who teaches him about friendship.

She wonders into their tribe and is adopted by the Village chief. Stand with fist becomes a translator between Dunbar and the Native Indians (eventhough she has not spoken these words (English) since she was two).

They then give him his tribal name ""Dances with wolves"". Overtime Lt. Dunbar becomes completely assimilated into their culture.
Granham Green gives an outstanding performance as the chief. Graham Greenbecomes the first Native American to be nominated for an Academy Award (Best Supporting Actor). Granham also gives a fine performance as Ishi in the movie ""Last of his tribe"".
One reviewer wrote that this movie tends to romanticize the Indians by portaying them as saintly people. I have had courses in American Indian Studies and I have to confess that it is true. Native Americans have been romanticized in our popular culture. Dances with wolves portray the Indians as good guys and white people as bad guys. This portrayal tends to be one sided. Not all white people were bad. Many wanted to help the Indians. But, because of their short sightedness and lack of understanding of Native American culture, many of their programs ended up hurting the native people. While many movies portray Native Americans are portrayed as Savages, Many Native Americans are also falsley portrayed as great evironmentalists. In fact Native Americans were just as exploitive of their resources as white people. They just didn't create an impact because their numbers were small and their population size was controlled by the carrying capacity of the environment. Many Native American tribes were aggressive and did kill white people with out provocation. Dances with wolves does tend to be one sided and is just as false as any other western that portray Indians as blood thirsty savages.
The story telling was very good and the cinematography was fantasic. The movie really showed the beauty of the western frontier. One needs to look at this movie not as a portrayal of white people or of Indians but, as the Journey of one man's soul.",1030060800,6,2531,4.929742388758783

  Over the course of this picture, we are left with the impression that Dunbar is, nor was, ever truly happy with whom he was. The scenary is intense, and the message is even more intense. A tribe of Sioux warriors meets up with Dunbar through a series of awkward moments, and soon Dunbar discovers that all of his preconceived notions about ""indians"" are untrue. The Sioux want to know how many white men are coming to the West, and Dunbar wants to learn their culture. Over time, both realize
how to face each other without hostility, and to give what the other needs. Lt. Dunbar transforms himself into a man whom loves and learns as Dances With Wolves, while the Sioux prepare for the coming of the white men whom will destroy a thousand years of their heritage.
  If we watch this film keeping in mind what it means to wipe out an entire culture that existed on land that belonged to no one, we will understand that it doesn't matter who started those conflicts of that time. This movie takes a concise approach at defining what the future meant to the Native Americans, without ever compromising our attention to this daunting epic.",1029196800,2,1740,4.560897435897436
185255,4,1562550888,"This was the first time I viewed the entire movie, since my first viewing on the big screen when it first came out.  Knowing more about the subject now, than I did then, I am a little more critical.
Visually, this is still stunning and doesn't get boring despite its length.  It also still merits praise for being the first movie to cast all American Indians in the American Indian rolls, and to have tried, at least, to show a little bit about the American Indian culture of the time, and to have the Indians play a major roll, beyond simply attacking wagon trains.
However, the story is little romanticized, historically speaking. The impression it gives is that the Lakota (Sioux) were totally isolated from whites at the time, knowing nothing about them, and that the white lieutenant introduces them to guns during their fight with the Pawnee.  But judging from the time frame given in the movie (during the Civil War and 13 years before Crazy Horse's surrender) the year would be about 1864.  By that time the gun was already in use by the Lakota for quite some time.
As for isolation, the Grattan Fight, usually seen as the beginning of the long hostilities with the Plains Indians, took place in 1854 when the Lakota and some others were camped outside of Fort Laramie waiting for the arrival of annuities agreed upon in an earlier treaty. Indeed trade goods, such as calico for clothing and iron cooking pots would have been much more prevalent than they appeared in the film.
Also, if I remember correctly, in the book, the lieutenant actually stays with the Cheyenne, not Lakota, which would explain some references that seemed out of place in this context.
Of course one criticism I had the first time I saw this, and that still remains, is Kevin Costner's voice.  While he looked the part, and did a pretty good acting job, to me he always sounds like a twelve-year-old, and with a movie that depended so much on narration, that was a big draw back.
In all, the movie still merits watching.  However, viewers should keep in mind that, historically, at least, it is not totally correct.",1028592000,4,2098,4.6567567567567565
185256,5,1562550888,"Sumptuous, delicious, beautiful movie about a white soldier's journey of self-discovery with a Lakota Sioux tribe.
Lt. John Dunbar, a Civil War hero by accident (he was trying to kill himself), gets a second chance at life when he's allowed to choose his next military assignment.  He chooses to see the frontier--""before it's gone"".  Arriving at the fort, he finds it abandoned, disheveled, broken down.  As he tries to rebuild the fort and enjoy the scenery, hoping to see buffalo, he befriends a wolf, Two Socks.  Eventually the local Indians come to check him out, and Dunbar and his neighbors draw closer through a series of stop-and-start encounters.  He draws close enough to become one of them--but then Army life intrudes into the near-idyllic scene.
The details of the prairie and of Sioux village life are breathtaking.  The music by John Barry is atmospheric and inspiring.  I would hope those viewing the film will ask themselves what it would have been like to live an Indian village, if they would have been up to its demands and open to its possibilities.",1026086400,4,1071,4.883977900552487

I was impressed with how quickly my order was processed and delivered, but I found the description of the merchandise to be a little misleading.  It had been described as the 1994 edition with two casettes.  It also had reviews that talked about the four hour version and how much better it was.  By ordering from that page, I guess I assumed I would be getting the video that was described.  Oh well,... I know this is supposed to be for reviewing the movie itself and let me say again that it is one of the best movies I've ever seen; but maybe this can help people who are thinking of ordering--so they'll be really careful to check out all the details.

To do this in Dances with Wolves as Costner has is sensational when you consider how much the lead role dominated this movie, and how good the movie turned out. Set against a spectacular western backdrop, Costner's normally drab acting style suits this role very well.  Costner is a much maligned actor and sometimes the criticism is justified, but he should be applauded for his efforts in this atmospheric epic.  If you are after an action packed western then this movie is not for you.  If however, you want a fresh take on a western story, grand scenery, wonderful costumes, a nice love story, good photography and your prepared to invest some time in the movie then I highly recommend it.",1024185600,,820,4.483221476510067

While there, alone, he tries to befriend the local indian tribe.  He does this and begins communications with them.  Thought of as savages this movie shows that they were actually, atleast some tribes, more civilized than the white man at that time.  The friendship blossums and the Lt. becomes part of the tribal family.  Moving and hunting with it and he has gained acceptance.  Until the soldiers move into the fort and he is tried as a traitor to the U.S. and his new family must come to his rescue.
An outstanding movie that was a risk for Costner and it turned out to a focal point of his career that he will be remembered for.  Great scenery and many good actors.

No one has to be any type of ""expert movie critic"" to be able to tell quality in terms of substance of this movie. The storyline is very well orchestrated and reveals some deep cold realities of the Civil War; mainly the mind-set of the ""whites"" versus the natives. This of course is not to say that history is being factually told, but merely someone's portrayal of the Old West.
Now for my confession. I primarily purchased Dances with Wolves because of the DTS audio soundtrack. I know, shame on me, but I have read so many reviews about this movie's DTS audio that I had to have it. It took me awhile to find it and purchase it but in the end it paid off. The DTS audio in this movie is by far the best that I have experience. I have seen the Planet of the Apes, new version, a number of space-typ movies, the 13th Warrior, and none have the superb audio quality this movie has. This DTS audio track utilizes a perfect 5.1 channel mix consistently, and the bass (subwoofer) output is tremendous; you will have to reduce the bass! For all of you out there who primarily seek superb audio quality this movie is a must.

185265,5,1562550888,"This tale of the frontier and the last days of native culture in the west is Kevin Costner's best film to date. It tells the story of Union army officer John Dunbar who, disillusioned with the bloody civil war in the east, requests to be posted to a remote western outpost. He arrives to find the fort totally deserted with no sign of the garrison. His only companions are his trusty horse Cisco and a unusually friendly wolf he names Two-Socks. He soon makes contact with a band of Souix Indians who are at first curious but highly suspicious of the lone white man in their land. He finally rides out to make formal contact with them which eventually leads to friendship and acceptance by the tribe. Over time, he develops close friendships with several members of the clan, particularly Kicking Bird, the village holy man, Wind In His Hair, a stoic and powerful warrior, and Stands With a Fist, a white woman raised by Kicking Bird's family. Dumbar undertakes a journey of self-discovery as he grows ever closer to his new Indian friends, accompanying them on a buffalo hunt, defending the village against a Pawnee attack, and eventually marrying into the tribe. Slowly but surely, he ceases to be what he has always been, a white soldier named John Dunbar until all that remians is a Souix named Dances With Wolves. In the end, he must make a choice to defend his new friends or return to his old life and assist in the decimation of the Indians and their land.
Dances With Wolves is a beautiful film with strong characters and lush landscapes. Costner is in his element here as the soft spoken reluctant hero who must make serious life choices in the face of overwhelming odds. This movie definately embraces Rousseau's idea of the ""Noble Savage"" as the Souix are presented here as a proud and innocent people, unencumbered by vice, and threatened by an ever expanding flood of whites driven by the dreams of Manifest Destiny. Whether this is a factual depiction of the Indians is open to debate, but it cannot be denied that we are given a genuinely sympathetic picture of life on the plains and a desire to see Dunbar and his Indian allies hold back the inevitable...",1011830400,,2173,4.646753246753247

Like Leonard Maltin said, the locations this great masterpiece was film on are breathtaking to say the least. But don't take my word for it, or Leonard's...you have to see it for yourself.
I couldn't ever forget characters such as Stands With A Fist, Kicking Bird, Two Socks, Cysco and of course, Wind In His Hair... but most of all Dances With Wolves himself. Kevin Costner is not only a great actor in this, his direction behind the camera is remarkable and astoundingly beautiful.

185267,5,1562550888,"Having seen so seemingly few of Kevin Costner's films, and not thinking much of the ones I had, I wasn't expecting much before sitting down to watch Dances with Wolves. But I can say now without doubt that it's the best film of his I have ever seen and only left me wondering if he can make a film like this, why his most recent ones have been so awful. Maybe he has bad judgement.
Set in 1865, Costner plays John Dunbar an infantry solider in the US army who requests to be sent to the frontier after an act of suicide is mistaken for an act of heroism. Stationed all alone in a deserted outpost with nothing more than a horse, wolf and journal for company he soon finds that there are Indians aware of his presence. These Indians try and steal his horse on many occasions until he is left tied of waiting for the confrontation that is bound to come and makes his way to the Indians camp to introduce himself, from which point forth he makes leaps and bounds.
This is at heart, a deeply moving tale and one that holds much prevalence when you think of how the Indian's have had their name dragged through the mud with the westerns of years gone by, portraying them more like wild packs of dogs than human beings. This film helps to re-address the balance, with scenes of the Indian's gathering round having a meeting to decide what to do about the white man's presence helping to show that they can think as well as act menacing. Of course a big factor that holds the story together is that Dunbar is open minded and essentially a forward thinker, because with a shoot first and ask questions later attitude I doubt he would have lasted 5 minutes. Their were flaws in the film that I noticed, mostly that his change of allegiance and belonging from the army to the Indian's I found rather too quick and unconvincing much like his relationship with Stands With a Fist (a woman). I also thought the ending was a little too ambiguous as well but I won't dwell on that so as not to spoil it for those that haven't seen it.
Although I'm usually disingenuous when it comes to Oscar winners, I believe this film was a fully deserved winner. And that as frustrating as it is seeing Costner living in a self imposed exile of playing the role of the loner, this is worth seeing because not only is it a battle of mind over body but also a fight of the few against the might of the many. A sacrifice that too few of us are willing to make these days.",1002585600,3,2440,4.295010845986985

He is number one in this film.  But what a film!  The scene near the start where he rides his horse between Union and Rebel lines of battle, suicidal, hands thrown back, anticipating the hail of bullets....what a moment, unforgettable--and unforgettably ironic in that he gives his future enemies, the Union Army, their chance at glory.  This film is full of such ironies, such stabs at integrity and the perverse consequences of breathtaking chances taken in good faith.
If one man on an ego trip could finally dip down into the sources of real creativity and produce something wonderous, Costner did it here, dancing with wolves and with the wilderness so ably framed throughout the film.
More than cinematic, more than a love story, more than the tale of Sioux in retreat and an Everyman figure in his own retreat from the civilization that betrays everything for money and power, the dance herein traces the lineaments of a new kind of life, a life lived close to the natural fiber of things.  It's a possibility raised for whatever reasons.
Sometimes an actor is so obnoxious a person that discounting his creations is relatively easy, William Shatner being an obvious example.  I beg to disagree on the grounds of the fictional presence such actors create.  For I don't believe in fiction.  One person in so-called real life, they lend to us in the realm of imagination their very noblest selves.  In their productions, in their roles:  this is who they truly are!

185272,5,1562550888,"With so many reviews given before me, I will then go straight to the point about this movie.
For me, I admit that I am bias when movies are concern, bias in a sense that, no matter if the movie is from USA, China, Japan or Russia, aside from good script, good story line ,good characterization and free of unwanted prejudices and bashings, it must have GREAT CINEMATOGRAPHY! And to me,at least, Dances with the Wolves can be consider a buffet. Pick of your choice, its all there and eat all you can. It is this sumptuous.
Another thing, me personally at least, as an Asian viewer, who not only love and live along with different ethnicities, horse herders, nomads , farmers and aborigines along with modern cities and ancient villages, the main interesting point in watching Dances with the wolve is like watching a beautiful live documentary about the history of various Indian tribes and the Western Frontier period drama. Historical figures. Also,it is like putting me with its various people on the other side of the planet in the historical past.
Then , this movie to me , is very special in that sense.
I realized that the story of the movie may be fictatious, but the scenery and panoramas of the great frontier, the prairie , the buffalo hunts are visually stunning and the lifestyle and the costume of the Indians are amazingly beautiful, complicated and yet very very human,
I don't know how accurate this movie is in term of  costumes and language and all, perhaps my American counterparts can tell me. But knowing Spielberg, the highly acclaimed director and his reputation, I can safely said I believe the authenticities he put into his movies.
Some of my most favourite scenes are vista and the surrounding, so peaceful and quiet, when Kevin Costner in that long bouts of silent comtemplation, the Indians on the horizon line on horses, the stray lonely wolf that followed the lone soldier everywhere and the frustration and barrier of communication as well as the exchanging of gifts are inspiring, comical as well as touching.

185275,5,1562550888,"A lot of you don't know this, but I genuinely don't like Kevin Costner! I don't think he's a good actor; I think he's wooden! This film, despite it being his directorial debut, is all about the Indians -- not him. I loved this movie, as love all epic films! (I loved BRAVEHEART, but hate Mel Gibson!)...
Now that that is out of my system as a regular viewer, I will play the unbiased critic.
First off, DANCES WITH WOLVES is a beautiful, passionate film that swept away the audience, critics, and the Academy Awards. (FYI: Something my film PRISONER OF WAR will do in the very near future.) It is a special tale of Sioux Indians and their culture clash with the Americans who raped, murdered, destroyed, and stole this land away from them. They are obvious stereotypes in this film, amongst them are the physical aspects of the American soldiers. They are fat, sweaty, loud, rude, thieving, and obnoxious; while the (Pawnee) Indians are portrayed as savage, blood-thirsty killers -- and maybe they were! Maybe the Sioux Indians were killers, or peaceful people. Who knows?
It begins with Lt. John J. Dunbar (Costner), a Union officer, in the battlefields during the Civil War in 1863. He is able to lead the charge against the Confederate soldiers and score a victory. He is then reassigned to another location out in the valleys of the Midwest. Eventually, he makes contact with a Sioux Indian. Soon, word gets back to the other Indians of the white man and they advance forward with their investigation. Dunbar is nervous at first, as are the Indians (though, skeptical would be a better word), but they eventually come around and celebrate the return of Tatanka (Sioux for buffalo).
The film is supported by a interesting cast including: Mary McDonnell as Stands With a Fist, an American woman who was adopted by the Sioux after her family was murdered by Pawnee Indians in a flashabck sequence. (In the book, she is referred to as Christine.) She eventually falls for Dunbar and they get married. Graham Greene (not the novelist) is Kicking Bird, the Indian to make contact with Dunbar, and the holy man of his tribe. The rest of the cast are regular character actors playing the Indians (yes, some of them speak perfect English) and the soldiers. But an extra point goes to Murphy Brown's Robert Pastorelli for his hilarious turn as the foul and foul-mouthed Timmons.
In the end, Dunbar changes his name to Dances With Wolves; he gets captured by the Union soldiers; and eventually is freed when the Sioux, his new family, come to rescue him. It is an excellent film created by a man I cannot stand to look at or watch on the screen. But, like I said about Gibson, my hat's off to Costner.

You don't think this news didn't spread to other bands of Sioux? And that Winchestor rifle Kevin uses to slay the buffalo -- it hadn't been invented yet.

185278,5,1562550888,"Dances with Wolves is a movie of tremendous philosophical insight, in that philosophy is ""the love of wisdom"" and wisdom the knowldge of the truly ""good"" life.  It is an interesting blend of Aristotle's ethics and existentialism.  Only once he has been brought to his lowest, to the point of attempting suicide, can Lt. John Dunbar begin his journey towards life.  Rewarded for his ""courage"" he is givien his choice of assignments.  Seeking solitude and adventure, he chooses the western frontier, the unknown, before it is overrun by settlers.  At the farthermost post he finds what he was searching for.  Abandoned and dilapidated the post provides an outlet for him.  The task of rebuilding the post reflects his inner restoration.  However, neat and tidy the post, and thus the Leutenant himself, is without purpose.  His sense of duty, in which he finds his meaning, wains as time passes.  He begins to search outside himeself and his immediate surroundings.  Those he percieved as enemies, the Lakota, become friends.  Hostility gives way to hospitality.  Among his new friends he discovers entirely new approaches to life.  Among them, he finds in himself his own understandings of duty, community, relationships, morality, and love.  Lt. John J. Dunbar dies as he sheds the prejudices and pomposities of the manifest destiny culture from which he came.  Upon that death Dances with Wolves is born, as one unnaturally, into the Lakota Sioux tribe.  His self-discovery allows him to live as an authentic human being, allows him to be himself.  He is the one who comes to trust and to be trusted by beautiful fellow creatures, misjudged and wrongly vilified.  Ultimately, he comes to dance with them, sharing with them the richness of life, both sorrows and joys.  The end is even more beautiful.  His self-discovery does not lead him to a simple life to be lived out happily everafter among the people he loves.  In fact, the movie is the account only of the beginning of his journey.  It is the story of his discovery of the path to fulfillment, found in true community and marriage.  It is not enough simply to enjoy these for the rest of his days.  He must preserve them for others, for those he loves and for those unknown.  ""Dances with Wolves"" is not simply about a man, nor about a people, but about eveyman's and everypeople's constant journey towards fulfillment.  It is a journey which does not end, but is constantly rediscovered as we adventure in the unknown frontiers.  It can only be traveled in honesty and humility.  It is the path of life.",986947200,,2563,4.854503464203233

* The observation by Costner's character that Dances With Wolves, his Sioux name, means something to him while he gets no such feedback from his given name, John Dunbar.",980640000,,299,4.769230769230769
185281,5,1562550888,"In a word,this movie is wondrous.  It gives a view of the Native American culture which used to rule this landmass with a perspicacity and verisimilitude never before seen in an American movie theater.  This is truly a great American epic.
Kevin Costner, who is normally as bland as the Sahara desert, delivers the best performance of his career.  Although not the most exciting actor in cinema, Costner was nonetheless perfect for this part (just as William Shatner was perfect for Captain Kirk, despite his limited acting ability). Costner's direction, too, was impeccable.  The rest of the cast, including Graham Greene and Mary McDonnel, team up to create an instant classic.
The film takes place in the mid-1860s.  The Civil War is winding down and the Union Army has begun its invasion westward into American Indian country.  In other words, it takes place at an epoch that, looking back, would prove to be the beginning of the end for the Western American Indian way of life.  This movie is about the last days of an extraordinary culture which would find its end all too abruptly.
The story centers around a Union Army soldier named John Dunbar (Costner).  He ends up on an abandoned outpost out in the middle of the plain states.  During his pseudo-hermitage, he encounters a tribe of Sioux Indians.  Luckily for him, they prove to be friendly and it is the forging of their relationship(s) with him that form the core of the movie's plot.
This is an exceptional, powerful movie that is suitable for the entire family.  It has a few scenes of mild violence, but is far less graphic than what is shown on Television series every night.  The soundtrack, written by John Barry, is top notch and is integrated into the movie to an extent [both in emotional importance and in appropriate timing] that surpasses any movie score I've ever heard. This is a truly poignant film which can't help but move all who view it. As far as American movies go, this one is a must-see in my book.",978739200,20,1985,4.705202312138728
185282,5,1562550888,"This film, unlike any westerns, made me like it. Personally, I hate old westerns, because they are rasict. They make the Americans look good and the Indians look bad.
But not this film.
This is the other way around. The Indians look noble,kind,and full of genorisity. The Americans,however,look bad,evil,and are full of their ""white pride."" Greedy Americans!
This film could be the only film in my life that made me cry. And that's why I love it so much.
The only problem in this film was Mary Macdonnel's hairdo. Here are the Indians, with their wonderful, art-like clothing, and Mary has this sort of 70's Fawcett hair. Weird,isn't it?

There is much which helps this interpretation, the musical score which is simply astonishing, the scenery, incredible, the story itself, the sense of being there captured through the sound of crickets chirping, you can feel the hot sun beating down on the grass.
The soldier who looks for a world where his fellow human beings are not ignorant savages escapes the war torn fields of the civil war through a crazy stunt and by travelling through beautiful wilderness encounters an abandoned fort which he rebuilds. Through the journals he keeps his humanity is divulged, the experiences decribed become real, his own meeting with a wolf and the feeling of communication between them totally silent whose sensitivity so rarely seen is something else. The meetings for the first time with the Sioux and the friendships he forms, this is what makes this film more than just a movie. There are few films like this, with Forest Gump, Dr Zhivago and a very few others which approach this raw sense of being there.

185287,5,1562550888,"I adore DANCES WITH WOLVES.  It's my favorite film of all time, not only because it is a very moving story on many levels, but because it taught me  something; it changed me.  Our teachers lied in our high-school American  History classes -- They fed us propaganda by representing us Americans as  being the ""good guys"" and the Indians as the ""bad  guys.""  (And Columbus DIDN'T discover America!)  Maybe I should have  realized these things long before, but I hadn't really thought about them,  and for that I am embarrassed.  After seeing DANCES, I was ashamed, for the  first time in my life, to be a European-descended white American.
The  Lakota Sioux were portrayed as being a clean, honorable, curious, reverent,  and environmentally sensitive people, whereas the white soldiers were  portrayed exactly the opposite.  (The actor who played Spivey was perfectly  cast -- he was so obnoxious that I could have strangled him with my own  bare hands! )  Maybe that's what has captured so many who DID love this  movie -- For once, someone (Kevin Costner) took a HUGE risk, bucked the  Hollywood know-it-alls, and allowed the pendulum to swing the other way by  depicting the Native Americans as being the antithesis of all the previous  Hollywood portrayals (vicious murderers and plunderers of the whites).  These outdated cliches are extremes, and maybe we needed a portrayal at the  other extreme to bring our ideas of the Native Americans back toward  center.  As a result, we are left with a combination view that the Native  Americans had their good sides AND their dark sides, which is probably more  accurate anyway.  DANCES wakes us all up to thinking about these issues in  a new and non-Hollywood way.  IT'S ABOUT TIME!  And I applaud Michael Blake  (author of the original book), Kevin Costner, Jim Wilson, TIG Productions,  and Orion Pictures for bringing this story with its refreshing point of  view to us.  And it's a GREAT story, beautifully filmed -- movingly scored  -- a Masterpiece!  Who cares if it's not historically accurate!  I am  gratified for Kevin's sake that DANCES WITH WOLVES captured the 1990 Oscars  that it so richly deserved.
As for Kevin Costner himself, HE IS MY  FAVORITE ACTOR, not because of his acting skills . . . (yes, he does have  somewhat deadpan line-delivery habits, not enough variety in believable  facial expression, and a vacuous stare when his character is mulling  something over, but he is BRILLIANT on-screen in other ways, which I won't  elaborate on here) . . . but because of his choices in the films he wants  to do.  This is a man who simply wants to tell great stories!  His focus is  not on delivering us any particular message . . . he's not trying to be  politically correct . . . he's not into teaching us earth-shaking things or  ramming new points of view down our throats . . . his viewpoint isn't even  necessarily consistent from one film to another.  He just knows a good  story when he finds one and tries to bring it to us in the best way he can,  using the considerable arsenal of movie-making talents that he has.  THAT  IS NOBLE!  He is a very gifted storyteller!  I have enjoyed nearly every  one of his films, especially BULL DURHAM, FIELD OF DREAMS, TIN CUP, MESSAGE  IN A BOTTLE, and FOR LOVE OF THE GAME.  For me, these last two are close to  the bone (due to sadnesses in my own life), and I have come to love this  man (Costner) for what he has brought to me.  It's a very personal thing!  There's something in him that tells me he's a kindred spirit.  Handsome?  Definitely, but that's only skin deep.  I would call him BEAUTIFUL, because  that goes way deeper.  THAT's why he's my favorite actor!
If a  character in a film attracts me, I find I'm attracted more to the person  PORTRAYING the character than to the character him/herself.  I wonder,  ""What is it about the ACTOR who brings something from him/herself to  the role to make that character appealing to me?""  Costner has  strummed a deep personal chord in nearly every film he has done.  I  especially enjoy his sports movies, because he's naturally graceful and  athletic -- he has excelled at baseball, golf, horseback riding,  basketball, fishing, etc., in his own life.  This gives him more  credibility in such roles than perhaps any other actor in Hollywood.  And  I'm a sports nut in the very sports he likes to play.  THAT's why he's my  favorite actor!
At the risk of sounding ""over the top,"" I  have studied Kevin Costner's life and career for the past 16-or-so years,  ever since his FANDANGO days.  I've dug in and read a lot.  I know he has a  hard-to-get-along-with reputation in Hollywood.  He's even admitted he is  ""ferocious"" when it comes to making movies.  He's a purist, a  perfectionist, and is just standing up for what he believes will make a  great story FOR US ALL TO ENJOY.  Who can help but appreciate a person who  fights for our benefit like that!  THAT's why he's my favorite  actor!
Before making any judgments about a person, I like to study  his/her issues and try to get to the reasons why.  If you take the time to  find out about someone's motivations BEFORE you criticize, you might find  out some interesting things about what he or she is trying to accomplish.  Wouldn't you want to be treated the same way?  SO . . . I will defend Kevin  Costner, his ideas, his motivations, and the exceptional acting skills he  DOES have, as well as his movie choices, to anyone who chooses to lambaste  him!
Kevin . . . if you're there . . . I don't know how to reach you, or  even if I should try.  But I hope you find this and read it!  I hope it  lifts your spirits whenever they are low.",965865600,10,5668,4.579899497487437
185288,3,1562550888,"I first saw ""Dances With Wolves"" in the theatre when it first  came out at Christmas 1990 and was impressed. Even went back to see it again  with various family members. The theatre screen is where it should be  experienced to fully appreciate the scope of the picture. It loses alot  when translated to home video. Ideally it should be seen in the widescreen  version on as big a TV screen as possible. I have the collector's edition  which is letterboxed and in Dolby Surround,with nearly 60 mins. of  deleted,unseen footage and a behind the scenes documentary. It even has a  bunch of theatre lobby cards with various scenes. I don't know if the VHS  collector's edition is still available. It was a limited edition boxed set. I  don't know what the DVD edition is like.
  Memorable highlights were the  buffalo hunt,a truly great sequence. Composer John Barry's beautiful  score(he won the Academy Award for it).And,actor Graham Greene as the head  of the tribe.(He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. He lost to Joe  Pesci in ""Goodfellas"".)Mr. Greene was also very good in his  recurring role in the network series ""Northern Exposure"" in the  early '90's. The lowlights were Kevin Costner's dull,bland  performance.(Costner's best performance was in Clint Eastwood's critically  praised but overlooked ""A Perfect World"" from 1993).Another  lowlight was actress Mary McDonnell's weird hairstyle.(I didn't realize  they had hair salons on the prairie).
 ""Dances With Wolves"" is  a good film but not a great western.""Little Big Man"" from  1970,directed by Arthur Penn(1967's classic ""Bonnie and  Clyde""),and starring Dustin Hoffman, is one of the truly all time  great epic westerns. It has the same theme as ""Dances With  Wolves"",life with an Indian tribe in the late 1800's. In ""Little  Big Man"" the tribe are the Cheyenne. If you haven't seen it and you  liked ""Dances With Wolves"" you will really appreciate  ""Little Big Man"".However,""Dances With Wolves"" is the biggest moneymaker at the box-office of all time as of 2016.
  Two other westerns with similar themes  that I can highly recommend are 1972's ""Jeremiah Johnson"" with  Robert Redford and 1976's ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" with Clint  Eastwood. I know there are many critics who thought Martin Scorcese's  ""Goodfellas"" should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture  in 1990,not ""Dances With Wolves"".That's open to debate.",965260800,8,2394,5.138020833333333

185292,5,1562550888,"For once I agree with the critics. ""Dances with Wolves"" is brilliant. I walked out of the cinema after seeing this film and felt like I had gone through a religious revelation. I was glad to live in a world  which could make movies such as this.

OK, that sounds a little  over the top but that is how I felt at the time. I pity those people who  didn't get to  see ""Dances with Wolves"" on a big screen. Video  just does not do it justice. I own both the standard three hour wide screen  version laser disc of ""Dances with Wolves"" as well as the special  four hour edition. Despite the movie being terrific it is difficult for me  to sit down for four straight hours. For that reason I have to split it  over two sessions. The original edition is for visitors to watch.

Before I got the longer edition I was curious as to whether it was  better or just a watered down version of the first cut. Well it is  definitely better. There are so many new scenes that it would be too much  effort to list them. The major difference for me though was a section in  the middle where Dunbar, (Kevin Costner), has a moment of doubt about his  newfound friends. It occurs right before the buffalo hunt when he finds  them all celebrating their slaughter of the white buffalo hunters who were  responsible for the waste of so many fine animals. Even if it is justice he  is not comfortable with their evident joy at such an inherently brutal act.  'Nough said about the differences.

The core story is short but the  telling is rich in nuance. We meet the wounded hero, Lieutenant Dunbar, in  a American civil war hospital tent. He is about to have his leg amputated.  While the doctors are having a smoke break he decides to rejoin his  regiment and break a long standing stale mate by riding to his death across  the enemy lines.  It doesn't go quite as planned however and he ends up  being the hero that turned the tide of battle. As a reward, he is given the  use of the best doctor and an unlimited choice of duty.

His choice  is to go west to the Indian frontier. Unfortunately his superior officer at  his eventual posting, Major Fambrough, is mad. Just before his suicide the  Major sends Dunbar out to a new base right in the frontier. When he get's  there, the camp is deserted and unbeknownst to Dunbar the Major has not  filed his final order, meaning that no one knows the whereabouts of Dunbar.

Only a little perturbed, Dunbar decides to clean up the camp and  wait for reinforcements. It isn't long before the local Indians turn up to  make his life more interesting. Over the course of time he is drawn more  and more into their community. Eventually his is forced to take the side of  the Indians over that of his fellow soldiers. A situation which leads to  his arrest. The only other major factor in the film is his romance with a  white woman who has been raised in the tribe since she was a young girl.  She is responsible in no small part for Dunbar switching sides.

The message we are left with at the end of the film is that there  need not have been any SIDES in the first place.",957398400,8,3094,4.304347826086956

Yes it is visually stunning, yes the score is beautiful,(except the ridiculous  electronic dance sequence). This movie has a message though and it is  perfectly willing to hit you over the head with it. White people are  sweaty, wear dirty clothes, are immoral, incontinent, foul mouthed.  Indians, at least the Sioux Indians are clean, laundered, chaste, pure of  heart and speech. There are bad Indians but they are not Sioux, they are  Nazi's with feathers and loin cloths. When a white man decides to convert  to an Indian, he gets to have his hair blow dried and all his dirty clothes  laundered, he gets to have a serene attitude, he gets to have a fetching  young white woman who is also spotlessly clean because she has turned  Indian too. When we are all clean and pure we get new names.  The whole  thing is so manipulative and transparently racist I don't understand why so  many people fell for it.

If you've never seen the movie the dts dvd version is the way to go.  If you've  already seen it on other formats try it on the dts dvd,because you really  haven't EXPERIENCED it otherwise.  The movie is at times rather hokey but  the story is overall great and the scenery is absolutely breathtaking.  If  your a fan of westerns this is a must for your collection.",943660800,3,500,4.52808988764045
185305,5,1562550888,"I have been a DWW fan since the beginning. I have the VHS Collector's Edition 4 hour Version as well as the DVD. The DVD offers a feature long  commentary by Kevin and his partner, Jim Wilson that is like going to the  movie with them as they comment on each scene some 9 years after having  made the movie. It is absolutely wonderful and for those who love the movie  as much as I do, it is a gift. I hope that one day the 4 hour version will  be offered on DVD as well. The film changed my life and will always be my  favorite.",940982400,,529,3.897196261682243
185306,5,1562550888,"There is nothing condonable about Kevin Costner, I'm afraid, and unlike the Amazon review above, the ""love story"" aspect of this movie struck me as fundamentally silly (wow, an attractive white woman happens to  be living with a tribe full of Sioux -- lucky Kev!) Costner's  ""narration"" of the tale is annoying to listen to as well. But  strong performances, epic scope, good pacing, an engaging story, wonderful  details, some true grit, and a beautiful score, all add up to make this an  incredibly powerful movie. On a strictly emotional level, there are few  movies that have the impact on me that this one does. Intense,  tear-jerking, and past the surface flaws, captivatingly beautiful -- I  can't help but give it 5 stars.",939772800,7,730,4.878048780487805
185307,1,1562550888,"I was enjoying ""Dances with Wolves DTS"" (the most recent addition to my growing DVD library), but when I got to chapter 9 my Denon 5000 DVD player protested and would proceed no more. The audio tracks  dropped out completly and the picture went totally haywire, and it stayed  that way right thru to chapter 17. Oh I hate that! Playback from chapters  18 onwards was perfect, so if you're happy just to watch the beginning and  end of a movie, and miss everything in between, then ""Dances with  Wolves DTS"" is for you. Come-on Image-entertainment, whatever happened  to quality control!!",939168000,8,587,4.762376237623762
