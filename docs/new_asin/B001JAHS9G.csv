8312517,5,B001JAHS9G,"Like all the other fans I would love to see all of the five seasons of the Fall
guy released but 20th Century Fox won't because of poor sales. It's a shame that fans are left with an incomplete collection.  I purchased Season two from Amazon. Uk since it was only released in England.  Lucky for me I have a region free DVD player to watch it on.  I for one think that the Fall Guy got better as it went along, unlike most shows which are better in the beginning than lose steam as they go along.  Maybe one day before I'm dead someone will put out all of Fall Guy for everyone to enjoy.",1320019200,6,587,4.0344827586206895
8312518,5,B001JAHS9G,Release season 3 of THE FALL GUY. We are all waiting with cash in hand! Season  3 would sell well. ADDED - JAN 2018 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR SEE REASON WHY THEY WONT RELEASE SEASONS 3-5 OF THE FALL GUY. IF THEY WONT DO IT- PLEASE SELL THE RIGHTS TO ANOTHER COMPANY TO RELEASE THE SERIES. IT IS VERY SELFISH AND PROFIT-STARVING FOR GLEN LARSON/ FOX TO ROB THE FANS OF ONE OF THE GREATEST SHOWS OF THE EIGHTIES. SHAME ON THEM.,1319500800,2,422,4.0843373493975905
8312519,5,B001JAHS9G,"What is taken you so long to release the third season of the FallGuy? There are a lot of fans who are desperatly waiting for the next release. This series is cult! Please don't let us wait any longer and please don`t forget to put the complete episode of ""Trauma"" respectivly the appropriate episode of ""Trauma Center"" (""Notes about courage"")on the DVD.

By the way, there is a petition running in Germany to bring all the FallGuy seasons on DVD:

8312520,5,B001JAHS9G,C'mon FOX. I caved and bought the PAL version of Season 2. It's been over 2 years since season 1 was released. Get on the ball. Sell it to Universal. Do something!,1249689600,11,163,4.125
8312521,4,B001JAHS9G,"I don't see what is taking them so long to release this 1983-84 Season of THE FALL GUY out on DVD, especially since most other popular classic TV shows from the 80's and 70's are either already being released with all or at least most of their seasons on DVD box sets like THE ROCKFORD FILES, WONDER WOMAN, THE INCREDIBLE HULK, KNIGHT RIDER, MAGNUM, A-TEAM, etc., but THE FALL GUY has only gotten as far as the 1st Season so far, which was released nearly 2 years ago, since they haven't released another FALL GUY season since the Summer of 2007.

It was also interesting seeing guest stars in this 1983-1984 Season like
*Lindsey Wagner reuniting with former co-star Lee Majors in the ""Devils Island"" episode after their co-starring days on THE BIONIC WOMAN & THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN

*Emmy award winning actor(Paul Winfield) in the ""Old Heroes Never Die"" episode

*Mary Crosby in the ""Bite Of The Wasp"" episode after her co-starring days on DALLAS and after previously guest starring in both the ""Ready, Aim, Die"" episode and the ""Strange Bedfellows"" episode

*Mills Watson in the ""Old Heroes Never Die"" episode after his co-starring days as Deputy Perkins on SHERIFF LOBO

*Richard Anderson in the ""Inside, Outside"" episode after his co-starring days as Oscar Goldman on THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN and THE BIONIC WOMAN

*Steve Keats in the ""Olympic Quest"" episode during his co-starring days on ALL MY CHILDREN

THE FALL GUY's 3rd Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when THE FALL GUY was part of ABC's Wednesday night line-up starting with THE FALL GUY at 8PM followed by DYNASTY at 9PM.",1236038400,7,1610,4.728571428571429
