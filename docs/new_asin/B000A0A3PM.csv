8071358,3,B000A0A3PM,"JUNIOR (aka: A CUT ABOVE) opens w/ two perfectly made-up, 80s-style, super-model ""inmates"" named K.C. and Jo (Suzanne DeLaurentis and Linda Singer) getting out of prison. Once outside, they don their best prostitute outfits, and hit the road. That is, after being assaulted, and shoving a coke-spoon up their pimp-y boyfriend's nose. Eventually, K.C. and Jo wind up under siege by fiendish, Neanderthal-like hillbillies. Said hicks cause mayhem, making life miserable for the heavenly ex-cons. In between attacks, the girls find time to be latched onto by leeches, romanced by a local Romeo, and for some nude sunbathing. JUNIOR is a ludicrous, stilted, developmentally stalled ""thriller"" from 1985. The hillbillies are so terribly portrayed, that they make an already terrible movie into a nearly unbearable mess. Still, there's something so ridiculous, so infantile about it, that it manages to be a sort of idiot classic. Junior himself is unsurpassed in his ADHD, redneck-y, non-charm. Then, there's ""mama"", the mute-man-in-a-wig of the slimy clan! Mama is a hoot, in a MOTHER'S DAY sort of way. My favorite character is K.C., w/ her Tawny Kitaen hair, and possibly the only hint of acting ability. You'll either howl w/ laughter, or hit yourself in the brain w/ a pipe-wrench over this one. There's really no middle ground...",1407801600,,1330,5.219626168224299
8071359,2,B000A0A3PM,"I saw this in the Horror Section at my local video store and with the chainsaw cover plus the reference to Freddy and Leatherface I can see why they put it there, but once I started watching it I quickly figured out this is not horror at all. It's more like a live action hillbilly version of a Roadrunner and Coyote cartoon.

The opening scene shows two 80's chicks with massive 80's hair and misshapen 80's bodies being released from prison. For hookerin', I guess. Two seconds after they walk out the gates this pimp dude in a huge car tries to run them over on the sidewalk. He jumps out of the car slaps and punches the women around then pours a bag of coke on the hood of the car and starts slamming this one chick's face into the coke!!! That's awesome and easily the highlight of the movie, but unfortunately we still have 80 minutes left. So the chick stabs the pimp in the nose and then they steal his car and the pile of money he just happens to have in the car.

They end up in some small town and after the Sheriff threatens them John Rambo-style they decide to buy a half dilapidated building on a lake and make a sandwich stand out of it! That makes zero sense cause this building appears to be in the middle of nowhere and to make matters worse all of the locals are a bunch of inbred rapists.

So for the next 60+ minutes it's just one attempted rape or assault scene after the next. After awhile it becomes humorous, cause these two chicks just keep going on about their business of fixing up the building even though they are constantly being attacked. It's retarded.

All together it's terrible, but at the same time I laughed quite a bit, so it wasn't a total loss. If you do decide to watch this turkey then you should at least have a drinking game...every time there's shot of one of the chick's ass then take a swig. You'll be [...] up quick!",1283385600,6,1866,4.277620396600566
