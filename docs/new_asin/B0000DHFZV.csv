At least 20 mins to long.. he is not ready for an hour show, Slow, boring, he needs to edit his routine.. but he is clean..",1305417600,,296,3.640625
8001034,2,B0000DHFZV,"I bought this dvd because I had really enjoyed his edition of the Bananas comedy.  I was disapointed because it was the same routine, but not as well done as on the Bananas comedy.  Funny material, but I didn't need to own it twice.",1174348800,,232,4.25
8001035,5,B0000DHFZV,"This DVD is the best of the two. I'm Confused is just great. I saw Kenn for the first time at a church camp i just recently attended. He spoke every night and did standup for us. He's amazing! he takes his style of 'Klean Komedy' and uses life situations to be flat out halarious. I bought this DVD along with I Don't Understand at my camp and this is one is just great. I highly, HIGHLY recommend this DVD. just great!",1090627200,3,419,4.121951219512195
