There is a lot of of detail shown on how techniques are done. You will learn to play simple songs from the start and get an understanding of some music theory, but in a simple to learn way. This is the best video I have ever seen for the harmonica. Annie Raines is laid back and makes learning easy.",1454976000,2,456,4.193181818181818

I bought the download version and all of the jams and charts work fine.

There's a computer program/ Android app called harp ninja that will really help with your bends.

I also like the books and CD's by David Harp on the harmonica.",1457222400,2,326,4.491525423728813
