8236014,5,B000ZMF7BA,"Found DAKOTA'S PRIDE and was drawn to it simply since a friend of mine has a son named Dakota.  I was overwhelmed with the beautiful feeling each and every person in this movie gave.  To my embarrassment, I must admit my own ignorance.  Thank you for the insight and knowledge of amazing people I've misunderstood my entire life.  Just, thank you",1477094400,,346,4.622950819672131
8236015,3,B000ZMF7BA,"If I was looking for something for educating people on down syndrome I would have given this 5-stars in a heartbeat, but for someone just looking to watch a documentary it felt a little long.",1453075200,,191,4.485714285714286
8236016,5,B000ZMF7BA,One of the best disability documentaries I've seen yet. And I've seen ALOT! I'll expand this in the future.,1408752000,,107,4.684210526315789
8236017,5,B000ZMF7BA,I love it because I have personal experience being born with Downs Syndrome and learning about what his life is and his surroundings about him.,1353888000,,143,4.76
8236018,5,B000ZMF7BA,"Dakota's Pride is a heartwarming portrayal of the many possibilities that come with raising a child with Down syndrome.  It documents interviews with well renowned physician and advocate Brian Skotko, pastors, educators, families and adults living with Ds. It dispels a lot of the myths surrounding this disorder, and illustrates how having an extra chromosome can be a blessing to families and societies in general.  What I love most about this video is that it does not present children and adults living with Down syndrome as something to fear, but as something to embrace, cherish and love. Buy this video and share it with those you love... it is a `must see'.",1311984000,,665,4.928571428571429
8236019,5,B000ZMF7BA,"Dakota's Pride is informative and entertaining for anyone who wants to gain a new understanding of Down syndrome.  This documentary chronicles the journey a father took to learn more about his son's congenital disorder. I was touched by all the personal stories and impressed by the many ways children and adults with Down syndrome inspire people around them.  This is a beautiful portrayal and I would recommend it to all my friends and family, and especially to any parent of a special needs child... it really shows the blessings that can come from raising a child with disabilities.",1310947200,,586,4.969387755102041
8236020,5,B000ZMF7BA,"Inspiring story for new parents of a child with Down syndrome.  Really helps you get a handle on many of the issues, but in a real way.  So much of what is out there for us is technical or medical in nature.  This documentary is by the parents for other parents.  They even interview actual persons living with Down syndrome, too, unlike most of the books you will read!",1203724800,5,370,4.318840579710145
