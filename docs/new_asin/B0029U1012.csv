8358287,3,B0029U1012,"Bad dub of low quality print.  Left and right parts of screen are cut off to fit old TV aspect ratio.  Otherwise not too bad, with interesting location scenes of Namibia.",1478995200,,170,4.451612903225806
8358288,3,B0029U1012,"Buyers beware of the Synergy version on sale here. The picture quality is incredibly poor - a 4:3 pan and scan of a widescreen original, so degraded as to have virtually no colour remaining (apart from a sickly yellow tint overall) this looks like a thousandth generation copy of something ripped from the TV.

A shame, since ""Coast of Skeletons"" is a likeable adventure yarn with a decent plot, good locations and some lively action scenes.

I may try the Australian version, which at least advertises itself as a widescreen transfer.",1276992000,6,535,4.868131868131868
