8196526,5,B000QJ1WVG,"Lucy Neatby, posted today about pirated versions of her knitting videos being sold on the web. These are pirated digital copies of DVDs she's produced. Now, you have to understand that the DVDs are sold quite legitimately through Amazon and other retailers.
Unfortunately, a bunch of people didn't understand that it was only the downloadable versions identified as ""apps"" that are the problem.
I bought this video from Lucy's website and I love it!!!",1429401600,,451,5.108108108108108

I was amazed at what I learned from Lucy Neatby's DVD.  The images are clear, it is like watching your own hands at work.  She is a master teacher and she makes everything look so simple. She does not only show you how to do a technique, she also explains why you would want to use it and how to read your stitches.

You won't find better teaching videos than these.  I consider these DVDs an indispensable tool for the knitter who is serious about her craft or is simply curious and wants to learn more. Trust me, for a knitter, these are yummier than chocolate, a real treat.",1230336000,38,653,4.225806451612903
8196535,5,B000QJ1WVG,"As a knitter for more years that I care to admit, I wondered what I could possibly learn from a DVD on knitting! I've seen a few of the knitting DVDs from different sources and I wasn't that impressed - not well photographed, hard to see what they were doing with their hands, some personal aspect of the insructor was kind of distracting, etc. Well, after watching most of Lucy's DVDs, let me tell you, I am humbled and amazed at all I DID NOT know :) I now have all 10 of the Knitter's Companion series in my knitting library and they are really wonderful. The DVDs are well-organized, clearly shot, the sound and lighting is great. And of course you get Lucy Neatby teaching you in your house anytime you want and she really doesn't care if  you are in your pj's! Happy knitting!",1180224000,64,782,4.3561643835616435
