8175099,1,B000FILX8U,"I find most post-apocalyptic movies interesting, and this looked like it would have a different twist.  I started and restarted the movie several times, before I finally came to the conclusion the low volume of the soundtrack, was in the soundtrack and not my equipment.  It never got any better.  The flashing lights through most of the movie gave me a headache.  I'm sorry to say, the ending wasn't worth the effort I put into hearing it.",1375747200,3,440,4.675324675324675
8175100,1,B000FILX8U,"For a bunch of young, upstart filmmakers it was a fine effort.  I'm sure they learned much about how to make scale models not look fake, how to properly use sound effects, write dialogue, do effective voiceovers, and generally keep the attention of an intelligent audience.

On the other hand:  If this was not a high school film project, the director should be slapped firmly with a trout wrapped in newspaper.",1368144000,5,411,4.76056338028169

add eleven more words. smile",1368144000,3,118,3.76
8175102,1,B000FILX8U,"i am a sucker for sci fi and give this genra a lot of room to be second rate and still redemable. However, this is the second time i have been duped into renting this horrible movie. they must have changed the cover art. it is pathetically bad and i never saw more than the first few minutes. i would love a refund. thanks for removing it from your palylist",1359072000,,357,4.114285714285714
8175103,1,B000FILX8U,some interesting ideas but really poor production and acting. i could have made this myself and a few friends. a real let down.,1343779200,5,127,4.565217391304348
8175104,4,B000FILX8U,"This movie had many interesting aspects. Don't watch this unless you are fine with some crazy twists. No, this movie didn't have the production quality of say... Avatar. However, it was very good nonetheless.  The ending was... wow! Which leads me to say, yes. I gave this 4 stars, just notched one because of where it fits in my tastes. I will recommend it though.",1339372800,4,365,4.615384615384615
8175105,2,B000FILX8U,"While the blurb sounded good, unfortunately Clone did not live up to its promise.

While the acting was ok, there were a couple of flaws in the script and the movie was very slow going in quite a few places.

The only bright light in the movie was the ending, which unfortunately made all of the previous 98% completely useless and a waste of the viewer's time.

Spend your money on a better movie.",1264809600,14,398,4.351351351351352
8175106,5,B000FILX8U,This is an inspirational film for any independant filmmaker out there. Jason's contagious enthusiasm is projected in this film. I acually enjoyed the bonus features even a little more than the movie (although the movie is amazing.) This film should be at every college and filmschool to inspire those film students. Great stuff!,1168387200,6,328,5.2075471698113205
