4335626,1,B004E10JCU,No stars. Was supposed to be 3d Blu-ray plus a Blu-ray disc and the was no 3d about the product. Just a regular bluray. And we paid for 3d blu ray. And this was our daughters birthday present and her first 3d movie. Booooooooo.,1459468800,,227,4.181818181818182
4335627,5,B004E10JCU,"Nobody can retell a fairytale as uniquely and expertly as
Disney.  For their 50th animated feature, Disney chose to
modernize the classic tale of Rapunzel, keeping somewhat
faithful to the original German fairytale by the Brothers Grimm.

As the film opens we learn how Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy
Moore) is kidnapped as a baby from a King and Queen by
an old woman (voiced by Donna Murphy) who finds that the
hair of the child has healing powers that will keep her forever
young.  Making certain that nobody else has passage to these
special powers, the princess is locked away atop a hidden tower.

As Rapunzel grows into a young teenage girl, so does the
length of her hair.  The elderly woman who has taken on the role
of the Princess' mother visits her daily, calling for her to let
her hair down so that with every brush, she remains young.

Enter Flynn Rider (voiced by Zachary Levi), a thief by trade,
who just happens upon the tower while being chased by just
about everyone he has double-crossed and stolen from.  Upon
meeting Rapunzel, Flynn is unwillingly coaxed into helping
the Princess escape the confines of the tower so she can
discover the wonders of the outside world.

Though the story is familiar to adults, this modern interpretation
offers a fresh perspective thanks to its exquisite animation that
looks more hand drawn than computer generated and the addition
of some friendly animals that include a horse named Maximus
and a cute chameleon named Pascal.  Tangled also boasts
an entertaining, funny cast of medieval characters that we first
meet in The Snuggly Duckling Bar which becomes the setting
for one of the best musical moments in the film.  Unfortunately,
as charming and cute a film Tangled is, the music and lyrics
by composer Alan Mencken and Glenn Slater are completely
forgettable.  I don't think anyone will finish the film remembering
a single tune.

Tangled has a very old-fashioned Disney look to it and you
can sense that the animators did everything possible to retain
that classic feel.  Transfer is ultra-sharp and detailed but
nothing else seems overdone as colors have more of an oil
painting feel rather than being abundantly vibrant.  Black
levels are quite acceptable and there is no artifacts present.

Keeping with the classic feel of the film, Disney hasn't
resorted to much ""gimmickry"" with its 3D effects.  Though
the animation is greatly enhanced by the technology the
effects are more subtle than being ""In Yo' Face.""  Several
objects do protrude the screen ever so slightly which include
swords, elbows, hands and splashing water. One of the more
memorable 3D moments of the film occurs when Rapunzel
is first introduced to the world outside her tower.  The
cleverly placed animated greenery in the foreground gives
a nice feeling of depth as the Princess romps across the forest floor.

Ghosting is a minor issue here.  As with most any
film it rears its ugly head in any scene that is dimly
lit.  You can see slight ghosting within the background
of Rapunzel's tower confines or The Snuggly Duckling
Bar.  Objects like a dropped rope or even pointed swords
exhibit double images around its edgings.

The 7.1 DTS Master Audio was downconverted to
5.1 on my system but sounded full-flavored and
immersive.  Dialogue is expertly carried through the
front channels with effect noises that are expertly
placed across the entire soundfield which lend to
making the 3D experience even more realistic.  The
film score comes across powerfully and I was quite
pleased with some of the underlying LFE activity that
came beneath a stampede of galloping horses and
other climatic moments within the film.  Overall, I would
rate this as a quality listening experience.

Tangled arrives in a 4-disc package that includes the
Blu-ray 3D and 2D versions, DVD and Digital Copy.
There is added supplemental material that includes
a behind-the-senes tour of the filmmaking process, deleted
scenes, expanded songs and two alternate versions of
the film's opening sequence.

Tangled certainly will not stand as Disney's most
memorable effort, but I'll be darned if I didn't have
an immensely enjoyable time watching it.  The film
has so much ""heart"" to it, and by the time it wrapped
itself up I had a tear in my eye.

The film and its effective 3D imagery makes for the
perfect family movie and it comes with the highest
of recommendations.",1453075200,,4379,4.9103260869565215

It has a flashing ""bar"" across the upper 1/3 of the screen ( the picture itself is normal as the movie plays but there is this annoying flashing strip that is only along the same straight line of the upper part of the screen and it won't go away the entire movie. Then it has a choice to play in 2D on the same disk but it won't play in 2D to see if that flashing will go away. I do not have this problem with any of my other 3D movies.
