1206970,5,B00000F4MO,"A creepy guy vandalizes her kid brother's dirt bike, so Billie  Jean (Helen Slater, who was never better) tries to get repair money from creepy guy's dad, who tries to tries to assault her and is accidentally shot.  Billie Jean, her brother, and friends go on the lam.  While they're trying to turn themselves in to an understanding cop (Peter Coyote, very good), they turn into outlaw folk heroes to all the kids in South Texas.
Not cliched, even with the ""Joan of Arc"" subtext.  Holds up pretty well even after close to 20 years.  Watch especially as Putter (Yeardley Smith, better know as the voice of Lisa Simpson) steals every scene she's in.",1055548800,13,647,4.640350877192983
1206971,4,B00000F4MO,"Not a perfect movie by any means.  There are places where it could have used a bit of editing.  The premise seems formula enough.  But watch this movie and then the classic ""gal-pal"" movie ""Thelma and Louise"".  The similarities are striking -- and this one came first.  I particularly like Peter Coyote as the tortured policeman who keeps trying to bring the story to a close before things get out of  hand.  Dean Stockwell, unfortunately, is a disappointment as the district attorney who wants to be attorney general, and some of the business he gets to do doesn't make a lot of sense.  Still, this is a chance to see both Helen Slater and Christian Slater in early roles.  And enjoy it both for its sense of fun and its message.",1046908800,4,730,4.511450381679389
1206972,5,B00000F4MO,"A classic of the 80's teen drama era.  This movie takes to extremes the ""kids against adults"" theme of the teen movies of the 80's.  If nothing more, this movie is HILARIOUS.  It was probably not intended so, and when I was 5 and this movie was new, I thought it was rather cool.  It's a great flick to sit around with a bunch of your friends and let off some steam with a good laugh.

The premise of the film is simple.  Well, actually it isn't simple at all; making it one of the reasons this movie is so over the top.  You see, Billie Jean tries to retrive money for motorcycle repairs for her brother from the father of the boy who damaged it.  He makes unwanted advances and the impatient brother breaks into the cash register at the man's store, finds a gun and accidentally shoots the man, leading the group of friends to go into hiding.  They find their way into a wealthy house where they team up with a rich kid in a fake kidnapping ploy to get the money.  Everything escalates as the group becomes famous and infamous in television and on radio over this incident, which in real life would have ended in the kids being quickly arrested and prosecuted.

Pat Benetar's ""Invincible"" is also a classic of the era, and quite fitting in the theme of the film trying too hard to be serious, and producing a comedy in its place.  Seeing Yeardley Smith before she grows up, and Christian Slater starring opposite Helen Slater (not actually related) as a blond teenager, is worth the whole package.  Peter Coyote plays the sympathetic cop.  Al from Quantum Leap and Rodney Dangerfield's son in the movie Back to School (I can't remember their names) make appearances as father and son.  If you think about it, it was really an ""all-star cast,"" or so one might have thought at the time...

The last time I watched this movie with some friends, we all laughed so hard our sides hurt.

The only unfortunate thing is that it is not available on DVD.",1042070400,3,1946,4.421348314606742
1206973,2,B00000F4MO,"God, from Helen Slater's rebel Joan of Arc haircut to Pat Benatar's brilliant theme song ""Invincible,"" this movie is so-o-o self-righteous in its ""Don't doubt the children"" message that you'll almost forget that it's about kids fighting a man over a broken dirt bike.
Basically, the movie now works as a trivia footnote. This was Yeardley Smith's biggest actual performance, before she became the ""voice of Lisa Simpson"" and did that cameo in ""As Good As It Gets."" Here she plays a mousy young girl who finds her own independence and her own short, rebellious haircut through her admiration of tortured teen-turned-media goddess Billie Jean (Slater). Also, Christian Slater, whom I don't think is actually related to Helen Slater, plays Billie Jean's troublesome-with-all-sorts-of-misguided-anger brother, whose dirt bike problems cause the whole movie to begin with. Keith Gordon, who played the guy who had the demon-possessed car in ""Christine"" and the guy with the demon-possessed father in ""Back to School,"" gave up on acting shortly after this and became a pretty good director.
My biggest problem with this movie is that it loses its message in the course of showcasing misunderstood youth. By the time Billie Jean starts throwing money at people and they burn theme T-shirts of her in effigy, I was confused. Was the point that Billie Jean wasn't a heroine? Was the point that all she wanted was fair treatment and didn't get it? Are we to believe that this is the only way kids can be understood, if they go on some rampage and fake a kidnapping? What does the film say about kids in general? What underlying themes are we, as an audience, supposed to carry away from this film?
The only thing it seems to conclude is that it's really cool and really rebellious to get a short haircut.",1041811200,5,1794,4.904605263157895

1207529,4,B00000F4MO,"Back in the mid-80s, I had a HUGE crush on Helen Slater after seeing her in the movie that put her on the map:  SUPERGIRL.  LEGEND OF BILLIE JEAN was her next film & came out a short time afterwards.  The reason it took me 30yrs to get around to watching this movie is the fact that I didn't care for the butch / Tomboyish haircut that she sports on the cover.  I SO long for Helen's beautiful blonde tresses.  However, after 3 decades, enough was enough & it was time to complete my viewing of Helen's cinematic compliation.

It took me all of 10 seconds to recall to mind why I was head-over-heels for her back in the 80s:  she has a wholesome girl-next-door beauty and the toned body of a dancer.  She shows off her lithe form in the 1st scene where she & her kid brother (played by a VERY young Christian Slater) head to the lake for a swim.  Seeing Helen ascend from the water brought to mind Ursula Andress emerging from the ocean in DR. NO.  Helen is nothing short of a Greek goddess!!  For those like me who are less than thrilled by her hairstyle, rest-assured she wears her hair long through roughly 1/2 the film.

As for the movie itself, Helen & her brother become involved in a mishap after a bunch of unscrupulous teenagers trash her brother's bike.  One thing leads to another & the teens + their 2 friends find themselves on the run from the law.  The ""legend"" of Billie Jean becomes something bigger-than-life and causes the rise of something akin to a cult.  Come to find out, Billie Jean shaves her head after being inspired by another young teenager who was persecuted in her time:  Joan of Arc.

This is not a great movie, but it's well worth seeing to all Helen Slater fans (like me!).  It is a bit campy, to be sure, but it does have that familiar 80s ""feel"" to it that I find nostalgic.  This film is not for everyone, but it is fun in its own way.  I did find the ending, in particular, to be kind of ""tacked on.""  Would have been nice for it to have an epilogue, but oh, well.

Sadly, after SUPERGIRL & LEGEND OF BILLIE JEAN back-to-back, Helen pretty much stopped making her rounds @ the box office. Aside from THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS & RUTHLESS PEOPLE, there wasn't a whole lot more that she did. Yes, she did do some ""B"" movies that were direct-to-video, but  did not become a household name.  I was hoping her career would evolve in a similar fashion to Jennifer Connolley, who came on the scene in LABYRINTH, made some forgettable movies like CAREER OPPORTUNITIES and then went on to some really stellar roles such as playing in A BEAUTIFUL MIND & BLOOD DIAMOND.

Sadly, this career path was simply not to be for Helen Slater.  On the upside, she has (fittingly) played the Earth mom of the Melissa Benoist TV show SUPERGIRL, so her career has come full circle.  If they were to do a reboot of LEGEND OF BILLIE JEAN with Helen playing the mother of a teenage daughter who gets into mischief in Texas, then hey, I'm there!!",1468454400,2,2954,4.333333333333333

Since then, I've never seen it play on TV like they did with Ferris Buller or The Breakfast Club in the 90s or/and into the millenium. I found out that the master tape was destroyed in a fire and that's the reason why it was never released on DVD commercially. I catched the movie by surprise on the Encore movie channels late this year and I had to get it and see if an attempt was made to finally transfer this gem on DVD or Blu-ray. I found this copy and I had to have it. I watched it as soon as it arrived in the mail. The picture quality is amazing as well as the sound. I compared it to the Encore Classics DVR version I had and it blew it away. It clearly is a DVR, since my Blu-Ray had trouble loading it at first but, that quickly passed and I got to enjoy this flick once more without any problems. It doesn't come with any extras except for movie commentary from Helen Slater and Yeardly Smith (Potterjacks). The plot might not be of academy award caliber but, it entertains and it brought a feeling of nostalgia as I only have good memories from watching this movie with family and friends. Plus I can never tire of Billie Jean bringing men down to their knees by busting their b*lls... LOL...",1415836800,,1291,4.188755020080321

I'm not going to analyze the movie because if you are here and reading this you've already seen the movie a bunch of times and are happy as hell that it's finally here to own forever. I for one am thrilled, although it's bittersweet  because the thrill of seeing it on cable for the first time in years will be gone. Oh well. A fair trade off.

1208370,4,B00000F4MO,"The mid to late 1980s and early 1990 were the golden age of television for me. Every Summer I would go to my dads for three to four weeks to visit. I loved hanging out with him as much as I could. However, after he went to bed around 9:00PM every night, the TV came on and the world of cable was waiting for me to ferociously engulf anything I possibly could in the late hours of the night.

This period of my life molded my healthy appetite for movies about renegade robots, slashing killers, deadly monsters, troubled teens, and any number of classic actors taking pratfalls for my own pleasure. The Legend of Billie Jean just happened to hit HBO and Cinemax around the particular time I was most ready for it.

When The Legend of Billie Jean was playing every few hours during the Summer of 1986, I had just embraced skateboarding culture and discovered the world of punk rock music. Helen Slaters transformation from homegrown Texan good girl to rebel outlaw really hit home for me subconsciously. Being 13, I highly doubt I put together the fact that I mirrored what I saw on the television. I was in the middle of finding my own identity at that time.

Mill Creek Entertainment recently released The Legend of Billie Jean Special Fair is Fair Edition. Theres two ways people should judge the movie. One is as an example of pop and teen culture in 1985. I would say it should get at least an A for this aspect. The second way to look at the movie is to gauge whether its message still stands up today. The recurring themes throughout the movie were Always stand up for yourself no matter what and Dont let people walk all over you, no matter how old you are. I believe those principles are just as important today as they were some thirty years ago.

The Blu-ray version of The Legend of Billie Jean is presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.78:1 aspect ratio.) Its 2.0 Dolby Digital audio isn't going to make consumers anticipating a solid upgrade to high-definition very happy. You would expect this cult classic to get a full 5.0 surround sound transfer, but it didn't happen. The picture is clean and the dialogue is easy to hear. It would be nice to experience the great soundtrack pumping all around you, though.

Theres nothing much to The Legend of Billie Jean Special Fair is Fair Edition. Its hard for me to justify the use of the word Special when so few extra features are included. The only bonus material we get for this Blu-ray release is audio commentary provided by Helen Slater and Yeardley Smith.

The Legend of Billie Jean is an accurate depiction of PG-13 films made for teens in the early and mid-eighties. There are a lot of kids using bad language. Helen Slater wears some skimpy clothes to attract the target audience. We also get some adult situations and violence to top it all off.

If you're serious about getting the latest and greatest versions of your favorite classic films, then The Legend of Billie Jean Special Fair is Fair Edition is a must-have. If you are a stickler for special features and bonus content, youll be disappointed in this release. The movie itself is definitely worth a watch for anyone who lived through the 1980s or wished they did.",1406937600,3,3192,4.56993006993007
1208371,4,B00000F4MO,"Today's high definition films are fantastic. truly life-like.  But you are not going to get a 30 year old film that's going to look as good as today's films. The 80's is my favorite for movies.  It's the largest part of of my whole DVD and Blu-ray collection.

When I replace my DVD with a new Blu-ray release, I'm not going to complain about how sub par the definition is to today's films, because films this old can only be improved so much.  The Blu-ray is still better than the DVD I replaced so I see this as an improvement.

The best way to watch films like this one, and to really enjoy it, is to only watch it when you are watching other 80's films or other older films.  Never watch an older film after watching something newer.  Because, of course, you are going to see a big disappointing difference.

But, if I were to have a complaint, it is this: I pre-ordered this blu-ray in advance before its release because I always thought that that was the way to ensure that I would get the best price. Amazon billed me $8.99 for this blu-ray, and it has already dropped to $5.19 before I even got mine in the mail. So, I guess that it is NOT a good idea to pre-order from Amazon anymore.  I should wait til after its release before I order, or maybe go check out my local stores first.  So, live and learn, huh?",1406851200,,1317,4.232
1208372,3,B00000F4MO,"I loved the movie when I was 15.  I shared it with my wife tonight and she loved it too.  Of course liking a movie is a personal choice.  It was just as I remembered.  And no, Helen Slater and Christian Slater are not related.  Yeardley Smith went on to play Lisa Simpson.

The movie originally had an R rating for 2 F-words but later won a PG-13 rating on appeal.

As for the Blu-ray itself, the menu is very simple.
Play with or without commentary.
No subtitles.
No scene selection and each of the four chapters are about 24 minutes long so don't count on that helping you find your place if you have to restart it.
Would it have killed them to add subtitles and a decent, useful menu?

Audio was satisfactory and picture was okay for a DVD quality.  But this was supposed to be a Blu-ray.  From what I've read, they did not have a decent master to make better copies.  Nevertheless, it seemed to be better than average for a DVD like resolution.

The DVD was 4 times more expensive than blu-ray so it was a no brainer to buy the blu-ray even if it's just a DVD on a blu-ray disc.",1406851200,5,1082,4.173913043478261

Come on people, this is an 80s gem, get some extras on it if you are going to be calling it any kind of ""Special Edition"".

1208483,4,B00000F4MO,"The difficult part about buying any product online is not being able to physically see the product. Therefore we rely on those who previously purchased the product to share their thoughts. I had yet to find someone who shared real thoughts about the product other than they loved the movie.

Quickly I will say that I am old enough to have watched this near the time of release and remember it. Although only being around 6-8 when I saw this movie, I have always enjoyed the movie and contiued to do so into adulthood.

My goal is to provide real informaiton for other who are as skeptical as I was when wanting to buy this movie. I had good luck this time in taking a chance. I hope that other find my review helpful.

The product:

I did some research and found that a DVD was released somwhere around 2011. If you google the title it can be found at various places from Walmart to Ebay. I am very skeptical of buying anything that seems as though it is a burned copy. I took a chance. The first thing I checked was the physical appearnce followed by the ability to play in a computer.

The DVD itself apprears to be in great quality. It does look like a burned copy. This conclusion is draw from the color that is visible from the side the laser reads. It is blue in color like the underside of a DVD-R disc and not silver like the underside of a disc from a mass produced copy of a movie. The side displaying the title looks like it was professionaly written using lightscribe technology to burn the information to the topside of the disc.

The case and the DVD smell like the plastic has just come from a machine that melted them into the current shape. It smells toxic. As I plan to watch the movie and not sniff the disc, I should be ok. The printed informaiton from the sleeve looks very real, but has some minor flaws in the resolution. It appears to look authentic as if it were printed by Tristar. It has all the standard copy protected warnings and informaiton from the manufacuturer. I am still skeptical about how this could be a copy if copyright laws are protecting the dvd.

As for playing, it did work in my computer. This is often an indication of a cheap copy. While it still may be a copy, it is of higher quality. It plays just fine, sounds great, and looks to be in great picture quality. The disc play shows all the standard warnings about copy rights and distribution. The main menu is very dull with only two options: Play the movie and Play the movie with commentary. I would suspect that it was done from a movie maker program. While not a professional, I have made home movies and title screens with menus for my family. This can be done with about any computer from a decent program.",1397779200,5,2713,4.339250493096647

1208487,4,B00000F4MO,"This movie is a classic for it's time. I believe this movie should be part of the 80s top 100 overall. It's a time when fashion, and hair were bigger than life. Shoulder pads were in and Nothing matched. Hair do's were even bigger can someone say hair net hairspray? Wish Helen had done more with her career. It's a lost to us all. Let's not forget Christian Slater who was awesome and played a perfect character. It's about empowerment of woman. Teaches us all, we deserve to take a stand for our beliefs.  Wonder if Michael Jackson had this movie in mind when he officially sang and danced to Billie Jean something to ponder about. Must see if you like the 80s kind of movies must have in library.

As I watched it again I honestly have to say it has lost that great movie appeal. I wish I could have rented it, it's a movie you can watch once and that's it.

My fiance hadn't seen it.  I couldn't find it in any resale stores so I came to good ol AMAZON and there it was.  It was much more expensive than I had anticipated but it's a cult classic so I had to have it.

It shipped fast, movie is good.  I was a kid when it came out and I lived in the Midwest.  I found it funny that now I live in Texas and I see that this movie was based and filmed in Texas. And on South Padre, Island where I travel to quite often so I saw some very familiar places.

Even as an adolescent and teenager I was never part of the crowd. These movies helped show me from an early age how to treat others and how to act, especially when you're a teenager where your surrounded by peer pressure. This movie taught me 'Fair is Fair' and that justice is important. No matter what. If someone does something wrong, they should have to own up to it and the consequences. Really empowering movie for young women. Plus I love how she can take care of herself, even if she is kneeing the guys in the nuts. I have always been a fan of Helen Slater and Christian Slater.

Billie Jean, is an attractive teenage girl, who is the older sister to Binx (Christian Slater, who by coincidence shares the same last name as his co-star, but they are not related!), who gets his prized motor scooter trashed by an obnoxious teen boy, Hubie Pyatt, who was just trying to get Billie Jean's attention.  When Billie Jean tries to get the money to fix the scooter from the boy's father, he tells her she can have the money, but only if she gives him sexual favors.  After Binx accidentally shoots the rival boy's father, Mr. Pyatt, the teens become outlaws (paired up with their fellow trailor park friends, Ophelia & Putter, who went along for the ride) & they hit the road, hiding from the cops, unrelenting in thier pursuit of ""Fair is fair""!  All they wanted was the money to fix the scooter, but what they got was the attention of the media & some adults who try to use them as scapegoats...to gain media attention & try to use them as an example of how kids have become...but they fight back by using the media, and to their surprise, everyone took their side to get them what was right!  Billie Jean became a sensation almost overnight & all the kids in Corpus Christie, TX start mimicking her but cutting off thier hair to show thier support. It is a fun ride with a great cast who shows you that with persistance, anyone who stands their ground will be recognized for their efforts.
Personally, this is one of my fave movies of all time!  I saw this for the first time when it came out on HBO, in the summer of 1986 (I was 12), & I watched it nearly every day that summer (since they repeat movies so much on those cable movie channels)!  I have watched it many, many, times as an adult as well, over the years!!  It never gets old!",1361836800,,1968,4.372602739726028

""Pat Benatar had mentioned in an interview she regretted having anything to do with the film and that the release of the DVD in NTSC format was being held

up by her. [citation needed] She remarked that it was one of the worst movies ever made, and early on made a point of saying so every time she played the song in

concert. [3] Her not signing the rights to have her music in the movie is why the DVD has not been released for many years.

In 2009, Columbia Pictures released in Europe a Spanish-titled DVD ""La Leyenda de Billie Jean"", with 4:3 open matte image, but without any bonus material. A remastered NTSC DVD including commentary by Helen Slater and Yeardley Smith was published by Sony

What do you get when you infuse 'Bonnie & Cylde' 1967 and 'Saint Joan' 1957 and an addition some spaghetti western to making one of the best gulity pleasures of the 1980s -- The Legend of Billie Jean! I have adored this movie since I was six years old, it's more than just a gulity pleasure -- this movie is life. Billie Jean is true heroine all can root for along with her sidekicks: brother Binx, best friends Ophelia and Putter, and later boyfriend Lloyd. While it didn't generator a major box office following in 1985, it still is a great escapism film for movie watchers who enjoy young outlaws seeking fairness and justice against the adults who break the laws themselves. 1985 had some of the best teen films of all-time: The Breakfast Club, Weird Science, Teen Wolf, The Goonies, and The Last Dragon. You can feel free to add The Legend of Billie Jean to this list!",1345334400,3,1069,4.680851063829787

1208885,5,B00000F4MO,"I've waited for the dvd release of this movie for so long.  the legend of billy jean remains my favorite 80s movie and one of my favorite movies of all time.  its got an excellent cast and story and for what i can tell its always been pretty popular but for some reason it was never released on dvd (same went with gleaming the cube which is now available but for almost 60 dollars).
Its the story of a brother and a sister billie jean and binx from corpus christi texas who go swimming one day and when binxes motor scooter is stolen by the good for nothing son of a good for nothing store owner.  I'm not going to say how but they along with a couple of friends of theirs wind up on the run from the law.  Billie Jean becomes a legend because of her take charge attitude toward the situation and the young lady from a lower income trailer park in texas becomes famous.  Its not corny like alot of movies of its time and its got a good soundtrack.
After years of watching the same crappy homemade vhs that whistles, snaps, crackles and pops and in the end jumped it is wonderful to have a nice clear picture.  The dvd has a nice clean picture and comes with a commentary done by Helen Slater who played billie jean davy and Yeardley Smith who played putter jax which I thought was a nice pick for commentators.

1208961,5,B00000F4MO,"I've been a fan of this movie since I was a kid. I took a trip to Corpus Christi with my parents when I was younger and visited/saw some of the filming locations of the movie, albeit unintentionally on my parents' part. Ever since I started buying DVDs, this has been one of those near the top of my ""must have"" list that just didn't exist. I would search around a couple times a year and see if I could find anything about a release, but time and time again, I was disappointed. A few years ago I made myself a DVD using a download of the HD broadcast shown on TV. It was an acceptable placeholder as I waited for a proper DVD to be released and it was the first time I'd ever seen the movie in widescreen.

I was beyond excited when I ran across this DVD listed here on Amazon last month and I knew it must be too good to be true. When I saw that this was a DVD-R, I thought it WAS too good to be true, but I started looking into the Columbia Classics deal and it looked to be legit, so I gave it a go. I couldn't be more pleased with this. The picture quality is way better than the HD broadcast I was previously watching.

If you're a fan of this movie and have been hoping for a proper DVD release, look no farther. It's probably not going to get any better than this. Jump on it now, because who knows how long it will be around.",1328140800,9,1335,3.9776119402985075

1208963,5,B00000F4MO,"Ill try to keep this brief, if your reading this then it is safe to say your probably not the casual movie watcher. I read through the reviews and failed to see any that answered all my questions, so here we go.

1. Physical appearance - I was expecting a burnt store bought DVD-R with the lack of description on this thing. No, it is a nice cover, and a factory labeled disc. Pretty much on par with the obscure movies that end up in thew Walmart 5 dollar spot. Think of ""Howard the Duck"", no insert, but a nice case, cover, and the DVD is properly labeled, and unless you know the difference between a DVD and a DVD-R, you probably wouldn't even know it's a DVD-R.

2. Actual Disc - Their is no real menu. Just a generic representation of one. It gives you the option of watching with commentary, or without.

3. Actual film - Ok, so it isn't crystal clear HD amazing quality. But it is BY FAR the best i have ever seen. this is even better than the version that played on HDTV a while back. This movie had sadly ONE VHS release, and it hasn't aged well, if you own a copy you know what i am referring to. All VHS is not created equal, and BJ was an early VHS tape. I am flat blown away by how good it looks. The masters to this movie were lost years ago, which is why it never got an official release, the only reason. I would hypothesize that this was a way for Sony to make money, while answering probably a few thousand requests. The Movie quality compared to a properly Digitally remastered film is about 8 out of 10 (Proper remaster being 10).

4. Good Buy? Are you kidding me?! It's done, if you have wanted a decent copy of this and have been waiting for years your done. Buy it, done deal. I've had bootlegs, VHS, all the above. I am an avid movie fan. I was absolutely relieved to find this. I wanted to get my wife a good copy of this and had just about given up. By one while they have them, because i don't think this one will stay in print too long.",1327017600,130,1965,4.096103896103896
1208964,5,B00000F4MO,"I have been waiting for this to get released on DVD for years, and not just because it was not available, but partly because over two years ago, cast member Yeardley Smith mentioned having recorded a DVD commentary and wondered why it had not been released.  In 2010, the movie was briefly available on Netflix's instant viewing.  I have yet to go for bootleg DVDs or bad copies no matter how much I want something that has been unreleased, but considering this was officially licensed, I ordered this and found it to be a VERY NICE transfer.  If it weren't for the description, no one would know any differently because the case and the disc are perfectly labeled just as well as any other DVD.  It does not look like a DVD-R at all, and neither does the quality.  The only thing generic about this disc is the DVD menu, a picture of which I have uploaded. It merely has the choices ""play movie"" and ""play with commentary"", and without even the title. (This follows the usual copyright and FBI warning screens) This is perfectly fine with me, simply in that it has the commentary track, and does a DVD really need a menu or extra padding before the content?  The picture of the movie is clear and in an aspect ratio that fills my HDTV (not 2:35 or 4:3 letterbox) In summary, whatever the source or deals behind getting this movie available should not matter to a viewer because the quality is good, and there is no violation of copyright. If you have anticipated and or liked ""The Legend of Billie Jean"", get this while you can. I hope Amazon can provide more unreleased films and TV shows in this manner if this is what it takes.  This is definitely much better than having only a streaming version available.",1326931200,7,1711,4.5

1208966,5,B00000F4MO,"Sony Screen Classics delivers the goods with this underrated '80s favorite of mine. ""The Legend of Billie Jean"" finally makes its way to DVD and although its a Made-to-Order DVR the print looks flawless (NOTE: See the screen grabs I posted in the Images section of this product) and this is the first MOD disc I own that contains bonus features (however, there are NO Subtitles). There's a commentary by Helen Slater and Yeardley Smith, and while it's not exactly captivating stuff, it is fun to hear them waxing nostalgic about the experience of filming this.

Other '80s films such as ""Pretty in Pink"", ""The Breakfast Club"" or ""Ferris Bueller"" have been overexposed and rerun to death on cable, and TLOBJ has been hiding away for years and never really achieved the cult status it deserved, so if you've forgotten this film, I recommend it as a fun time capsule. The script is well-paced, the characters are well-defined and the performances are excellent all-around.

A great story about justice and retribution in small-town Texas, though some of the plot points are a little far-fetched. Plus it's got a great theme song from Pat Benatar that also deserves to be better-remembered than it is.",1322956800,28,1197,4.891625615763547

As a pioneer for equality, this movie was ahead of it's time, but my question is, why did Pat Benatar hate it and why did it flop in theaters? Everyone seems to have an opinion about this film, some good and some bad, oh well, another film that critics didn't like for reasons that most audiences shouldn't care less about. Yes, I consider myself a freelance critic, but even I'm not always right, but I am entitled to my opinion, even when others don't agree. I won't go into detail about the plot, everyone else has done plenty of that. Suffice to say, though hardly original, it's still well-acted, esp. by Helen Slater as Billie Jean, and enjoyable and sends a message for people who've been bullied or pushed around, but wanna stand up for themselves, can't wait to own it!",1322697600,2,918,4.569696969696969

That it's a Warner Bros product.
REmastered by Sony pictures.
The transfer is anamorphic.
And is about the same quality as a regular DVD.
Warner uses pretty high grade discs too.

I was expecting just a straight video transfer from an old video archive.  Many thanks to Sony and Warner Bros for producing a quality product.  It is a DVR transfer, so the disc you get will be a DVD that the company burned from a data file, but it plays beautifully and it was probably the cleanest picture I've ever seen of the movie.

The picture quality and sound are very good. If you love this movie as much as I do it is a very good by. Why amazon did not advertise this was being released is strange. But here it is a copy you will be happy to finally own. Now for the best news of all. Drum roll please! A full film commentary by Billie Jean herself Helen slater! That's right. The Helen slater!

1209004,4,B00000F4MO,"Sure, it's a manufactured on demand DVD, with somewhat generic cover art and you'll never see it available in stores, but it's a real legitimate non-bootleg copy of The Legend of Billie Jean made by Warner Archive.  If you're ordering directly from amazon, this is not the same ripped-from-VHS version that's discussed in the other reviews.  It's the real deal.  For starters, it's 16 x 9 and widescreen and it has audio commentary.  It's the only feature and it's accessible through a really generic menu screen, but it's there.  You're not going to get any profound insights from it, but Yeardley Smith is charming as always (as she is on the Simpsons DVD commentaries), while Helen Slater provides a little background on the development of the film that I hadn't heard anywhere else.  The picture quality is surprisingly pretty solid.  I saw this in HD on cable awhile back, and while this may not have the bold presence of high definition, I'd go so far as to say that it's slightly better than version I saw broadcasted.  The colors on this DVD are much warmer and richer, and I distinctly remember weird artifacts and damage to the print on the HD one that are simply not present here.  There's a thin layer of 80s film grain to it, giving a nice gritty touch to it that it couldn't have had on my old betamax tape.  If you are looking for flaws, there is a strange very very thin colored bar on the right side of the frame from time to time.  Could possibly be my player, even.  You wouldn't have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out to you, but now you will.  And the sound is 2 channel stereo, as it should be.  However, all previous music licensing concerns are irrelevant because every song is in tact on this release.

So with all the technical stuff out of the way, I guess I'll describe the movie to the few people reading this who don't know.  The Legend of Billie Jean is the story of a group of well meaning teenagers in Texas who accidentally become outlaws with a growing fame fueled by the local media.  Think something somewhat along the lines of a lighter and more feminine version of The Warriors.  It's got a rocking 80s soundtrack, oddball 80s fashion, and wonderfully over the top Southern accents.  It's not a ""so bad it's good movie,"" but it makes me giggle nonstop for it's entire runtime - sometimes intentionally, sometimes not.  Almost everything Yeardley Smith's character says is a riot.  It's my personal Rocky Horror Picture Show and it makes me want to dress up like the characters, yell at the screen, and quote its dialog.  I can't say that if you haven't caught this movie at a young age that you can still be indoctrinated into the Billie Jean cult.  It may just be for the already converted, but this DVD is much appreciated.",1320796800,5,2768,4.536290322580645

1209008,4,B00000F4MO,"Billie Jean is typical saturday afternoon fare.  Remember those days, when basic airwave TV would show cool movies during rainy and lazy weekend afternoons?

Anyway, the plot is basic 80s stuff centered around a group of well meaning but wrongfully accused teens whose problems in a small town in Texas escalate to the point that they are forced to flee from the law.  Along the way we learn more about them, watch as they narrowly escape detention, and are bombarded by 80s tunes by the likes of Billy Idol and Pat Benatar.  There is a lot of tension and controversy between the adults who see them as no good punks, and the youth who see them as the innocent victims that they are.  The movie draws a parralel between Billie Jean and Joan of Arc, I guess cause they were both persecuted.  Otherwise, it's a stretch.

But I think this movie deserves its due.  The dialogue is believable, well written, and skillfully delivered by the actors.  The plot, simple as it is, is easy to follow, and captivating at times.  You really want to see where the next scene is going, and never does the movie get bogged down in repedative action.  It flows well and constantly seeks new ground.  That's what makes this such an interesting movie.  Each scene advances the story a little further, so you feel like you're building up to something.  The movie also avoids using too many cliques and meladramatic incidents to build on.

The acting is another impressive factor.  For a cast of small time actors (Christian Slater hadn't really peaked when he did this movie remember), its very well executed.  Everyone involved is at least accetable, and a few like Richard Bradford (as Mr. Pyatt) stand out really well.  Helen Slater does a good job in the lead role, taking Billie Jean from a humble girl to a hardened woman.

I also like how the film uses simple locations to film the scenes in.  I guess they actually made the movie on location in Corpus Christie, TX, and I like that air of authenticity.

Of coarse, like all good 80s movies, there is a deeper message we are supposed to walk away with.  The film focuses on the plight of the young, much like The Breakfast Club, and seems to beg a more sympathetic approach to kids.  But, I think this movie avoids casting the adults too harshly, or the kids too innocently.  After all, there are examples of adults who are very fair and caring, a nice offset from the ""all adults are evil"" theme some other movies have.  There are some other issues as well, such as class, exploitation, abuse, and commercialism, pretty heavy stuff for a fun 80s film.  This was back when adults treated kids poorly because they offered us no real value.  Today, we appreciate our youth for what they are--hungry consumers who buy lots of expensive stuff like phones and cars.  I suppose that is the irony in this movie, which you'll understand at the end when everybody destroys their Billie Jean merchandise.

Now there are a few bad points you could look at.  Some say it's dated, and sure, it is.  Why we always assume if a movie is dated it somehow looses its worth is beyond me.  Just because it takes place in the 80s doesn't diminish the story any.  The allusion of Billie Jean to Joan of Arc is a little cloudy in my opinion.  After all, Joan was a military leader who led armies in battle.  Billie Jean was running from the cops.  You could argue she is crusading for the youth, but it's thin.  The obvious gap in the movie is the inability of the police to catch these kids who are driving around in a giant station wagon.  You could say this is a flaw, but if you injected that kind of reality into the story, they would have been arrested in the first 15 minutes and that would have been the end.  It's a deliberate choice the writers had to make by asking you to turn the other way and ignore the obvious so you can watch a good movie instead of a bad one.

To sum up, what you have here is a virtually unknown classic of 80s film.  It's thoughtful and well made, and will captivate your interest throughout.  It has moments of fun, but also some serious points, too, but nothing so serious that you are rolling your eyes. For what it is and the type of movie it seeks to be, it is nearly flawless.",1316044800,2,4233,4.451235370611183
1209009,4,B00000F4MO,This is the exact movie I wanted but it was a dubbed copy and not as clear as I wouldve like it.,1315526400,,96,3.409090909090909
1209030,5,B00000F4MO,"At times, there are some decent, good quality Region 1 (U.S.A.) dvds, of this classic 1985 movie, available from amazon 3rd party sellers. They are legitimate dvds & come in a dvd case, with a picture of Billie Jean on the front of the case, & more cover art on the back of the dvd case. Also, on the actual dvd disc, they have the the ""DVD Video"" Logo, and the ""Dolby Digital"" Logo. Also on the actual dvd, it has the Title ""The Legend of Billie Jean"". However, unfortunately, there are also, some dvds of this movie, that are ""amateur rip-offs"", that come with only a dvd disc, mailed in an envelope, with no dvd case what so ever. There have been a lot of negative reviews of this dvd, however there are some good quality DVDS, well worth having of this product. The good ones have scene selections on the menu, and they're full screen.

So, in conclusion, I have had a lot of experience with this movie by ordering from various websites, other than amazon, and some of these, both good and bad, sometimes make their way into amazon, via 3rd party sellers. What I would advise, is when one becomes available from an Amazon 3rd party seller, judge it on an individual basis. If the seller describes it as coming in a dvd case, with a picture of Billie Jean on the front, more art work on the back of the dvd case, and with the actual dvd disc having the ""DVD Video"" Logo, & the ""Dolby Digital"" Logo, and the title ""The Legend of Billie Jean"" printed on the disc, them it should be a good decent dvd. Also, make sure the seller states it is a Region 1 (U.S.A.) DVD. However, if the seller does not give a full description, with the things I have mentioned, then BEWARE, it may be a ""rip-off"".

Also, the good, decent dvds that I have described ot ""The Legend of Billie Jean"" DVD, are probably professionally, manufactured, reproductions of the VHS version. But, they have been reproduced, extremely well, and there is no notable difference between a  professionlly, manufactured, VHS  reproduction dvd, from an orginal manufactured dvd. As another reviewer pointed out, these companies have been granted a ""License"", to legally do so.

So, these good, decent dvds that I have described are the BEST OPTION AVAILABLE, for this classic move. They are definitely better than a VHS, for sure. I hope this clears up the confusion, of this classic, well sought after, hard to find, dvd. I hope this information has been helpful. Thanks very much!!!",1308268800,,2443,4.555808656036446
1209031,5,B00000F4MO,"Okay I am writing this review not so much for the movie ""The Legend of Billie Jean"" most of us already know its an 80's classic. I am writing about all the negitive feedback and reviews about fake copies and bootlegs and all the complaints about homemade dvd-r's. Thats not really the truth, sellers are not sitting at home making vhs transfers and selling them on Amazon. There are ""Legal Licensed Company's"" online that have permission to make DVD-R's transfers from VHS Movies that were never made or officially released on region 1 U.S and Canada. These company's do disclose that all the movies they sell were never released officially in the USA and that they are DVD-R's. They also disclose all their legal rights and necessary information ect. They are done as professional as possible but of course a copie from a vhs is still going to be like vhs quality and not dvd store bought movie quality. Most come with dvd cover art and dvd case and most of these dvd-r's come with menu's including chapters and trailers. (Most Are Region 0) play worldwide. And they do come sealed.

I do not work or indorse any of these companys and I am not going to reveal the name of any of these companys, I can confirm they do exist. I am just a huge movie fan and collector with 30 years of experience buying/selling and collecting. These company's are not the only ones that release titles like this Amazon them selves manufacture and sell DVD-R's for example look up ""Trojan Wars"" or ""Feds"" movies and you will see.

I know most people will not except or want anything to do with there DVD-R's but if you want some of these movies that have never been officially released in the U.S. or Canada this is the closet thing your gonna get. Some of these movies may never be released on dvd officailly... so you decide if they are worth it or not.

It did arrive pretty quick, yeah, it was a bit expensive for a copy. To be honest, if you seek out a service that will transfer vhs tape to dvd, it will run you the same price if not more.

As for the fire at Paramount destroying the original, whether or not that is true (which I don't believe so) is irrelevant.  The issue is that this movie only made $3.5 million in the box office.  Pat Benatar has openly mocked this movie and since her music is the heartbeat of this movie, I am sure she is the hold up.  The rumor on the internet for years has been about the music rights.

I think the reason this is not out on DVD relates to music rights. Many movies and tv series (Northern Exposure) are delayed because of music rights. They never negotiated the DVD format when the movie was made. In the case of Northern Exposure, when it was finally released it had new background music on many of its episodes to avoid paying out larger music royalties, which angered die hard fans. In the case of Billie Jean they'd have to pay Billy Idol, Pat Benatar and others some royalties. But they would make that x100 back in the sales.

The movie studios wonder why they are losing so much money (online pirating is to blame a bit I suppose). They have movies like this sitting in their vaults just rotting. Get a clue and slap this on DVD!!

When it showed here, it was pretty wild to see your friends up on the big screen in the background as extras.  The dude selling the t-shirts on the beach - I knew that guy and they got some other guy to dub his voice.  Very weird to hear that voice come out of his mouth.  I auditioned as an extra but it required me missing school a day or two and my mom wouldn't have any of it.  Great music throughout, esp. Pat Benatar's ""Invincible"".  A lot of the area the movie shows is no longer around such as the amusement park and the abandoned mini-golf.  The surf shop, though, where it all begins, is still in business.  I think I read one of the synopsis that says Billie Jean and her friends cruise around the state.  I don't remember that. It seemed they stayed in Corpus Christi the whole time, just one step ahead of the law.  I think one of the stars in the movie now does Lisa Simpson's voice on The Simpsons - she's the comic relief in this movie and is really good in it.  She has a terrific scene with her mother and a pair of scissors.  She also has a very funny line where she's sitting on the dock with Billie Jean after a certain ""incident"".

1209326,5,B00000F4MO,"Billie Jean is your typical teenager living in Texas. She lives in the local trailer park with her mom and her brother, Binx. The movie starts at a good pace with rocking music during which we hear a radio announcer announce how hot it is in Corpus Christi and we see Billie Jean jump on the back of Binx's motor scooter and they ride into town while being trailed by four guys in a car.

Billie Jean and Binx go to swim at the lake, during which time Binx's motor scooter gets stolen by the guys who had been trailing them. That night, Binx runs off to get the bike back while Billie Jean and two trailer park neighbors Ophelia and Putter take her to the cops to report the missing bike. They get back to find the bike sitting in front of Billie Jean's trailer, destroyed. Billie Jean then goes inside the trailer and finds her brother badly beaten up. Hubey Pyatt is responsible for the trashing of both Binx and the bike.

The next day Ophelia takes Binx and Billie Jean to go get the money (608 bucks) from Hubey's father to fix the motor scooter. Mr. Pyatt convinces Billie Jean to come upstairs in his tiny convenience store to get the money. Big mistake...Mr. Pyatt says Billie Jean will have to sleep with him in order to keep receiving the 608 dollars...giving only 50 bucks for each of his ""sex lessons"". Billie Jean escapes from his strong hold and runs downstairs where Binx and Ophelia are waiting..with a gun.

Binx accidentally shoots Mr. Pyatt in the shoulder which spells TROUBLE for he and his sister. Ophelia drives back to the trailer park so that Billie Jean and Binx can get their stuff...they are officially on the run from the cops. Putter, the annoying, yet lively, friend wants to come too...even though she had nothing to do with the incident. She goes with them. The four friends set out on a quest for justice.

There are several high energy scenes in the show, which anybody can love:

~Billie Jean and Binx running into their trailer and packing up their stuff.

~Billie Jean cutting her hair...probably the most important scene from the whole movie.

~Putter getting her period. (emotional :))

~The ""beach scene"" in the end.

~The burning of Mr. Pyatt's stand in the end.

You won't regret watching this movie. And hey, if you can't buy it here, I'm sure it's playing on a cable channel somewhere in the world!",1102464000,10,615,4.220338983050848
1209334,5,B00000F4MO,"""Te Legend of Billie Jean"" is one of my favorite movies because it is so different from any other movie I've seen. It's extremely funny in places where it's probably not supposed to be(just watch the interaction between Putter and Ophelia). I thought the town they were in was very cool(I wonder if they were actually in Corpus Christi). Some parts were confusing-for example,how did the little boy with the red hair get the tape with Billie Jean on it, how did the teens get into the mansion, etc. The movie itself made the viewer want to raise their fist in the air. In other words, it felt like an 80s movie geared towards rockers and teenagers from that era. Now if this movie can only get released on DVD!!!! It is a hidden gem that can only be found on cable tv or in few video stores.",1091664000,9,791,4.351351351351352
