Makes you want to see that play.",1141948800,2,145,3.8333333333333335
3872855,3,B0028O9ZFM,"The documentary ""This So-Called Disaster"" is a behind-the-scenes look at the making of Sam Sheppard's semi-autobiographical play ""The Late Henry Moss,"" which debuted in San Francisco in 2000.  Being himself the son of an alcoholic father, Sheppard drew upon his own personal experience for this cathartic tale of two brothers' coming to terms with the death of their own alcoholic father.  The actors in this production include Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Cheech Marin and Woody Harrelson.  As Penn says at one point, Sheppard's plays often deal with the theme of men trying to forge their identities in a world with no clear-cut definition of what a man is supposed to be.  This theme filters through in both the snippets of the play we see being worked on in the rehearsals and in the on-camera interviews with Sheppard and many of the principal performers in the production.

It's a tribute to both the power of Sheppard's writing and the talent of the actors playing the roles that we find ourselves wanting to see this play merely from the glimpses we get of it in rough-cut form.  Anyone interested in playwriting and fine acting will be mesmerized by the nuts-and-bolts aspects of this film, as it shows us just how a theatrical work, involving some of the greatest talents in modern drama, ultimately comes to fruition.

It's no ""Looking for Richard,"" but ""This So-Called Disaster"" has much to offer the serious theaterphile.",1116720000,12,1428,4.925

3872857,4,B0028O9ZFM,"Contrary to the review published above, I saw this film at its premiere showing at the Film Forum in New York, and found it fascinating and exciting.  The film was a riveting documentation of the organic artistic process in the theater.  The film is far from a commercial for Sam Shepard  - on the contrary, it demonstrates in part, the difficulty he had managing his volatile but brilliant cast for the production of his strange, fascinating play, The Late Henry Moss.  Good for anyone in the theater or any of the arts.",1105920000,16,521,4.630434782608695
3872858,1,B0028O9ZFM,"This is a hard film to review because basically it was nothing more than a documentary reviewing the performances and story of Shepard's new play.  It was a huge review that showcased the talents of the artist and the director while also giving us a backstage pass to a play many of us probably never heard of.  It was our chance to see art in progress without having to leave the comfort of our couches.  This was sad to see because we as people should be getting out of our seats and spending more time in museums, theaters, and galleries, but for those that do not wish to do so we have this film to enjoy.  We get to see one side of the story with good emotional moments torn out to allow for more of Shepard trying to show us that this play is not about his life, but instead just a work of fiction.

While I am sure that this comment will anger some, I felt that this documentary was too commercial.  I say this because I am not really sure what the purpose of making this film was.  By the end of the film, I am excited to see that Shepard's work paid of well for him, but I never really saw him struggling.  I guess that I am brought up in the MTV generation where ""reality programs"" have that constant theme of emotional turbulence, but there was nothing in this feature that came close to that.  There was honestly no real direction that director Michael Almereyda gave to his film.  Were we to see that Shepard was a [...] in real life because of the influence of his father?  Maybe, but it was never shown.  There was the one scene where Shepard tells Nolte to forget that his mother just died because he has a job to fulfill, a job that basically highlights the death of his own father.  I thought that this was rude of Shepard, and I felt some unknown sympathy for Nolte.  Outside of this Shepard was never really mean to his actors nor did he ever really blow a fuse.  His emotional level was non-existent as he wandered through this documentary.  Perhaps this film was to show how the actors stressed emotionally and physically to Shepard's style of directing?  I would have to say I never saw this either.  The actors did their job (well, maybe not Woody) and they listened to what Shepard had to say.  He was respected and everyone gave him the respect that he deserved.  This was a flawless performance and development that I thought Almereyda was trying to create.  I thought he was the catalyst in this film, only causing more trouble than actually showing the play itself.  It almost felt as if he was digging his nose into other people's business, and they were not receptive to it.  I remember one scene where Penn literally ran away when he saw the camera.  I don't think anyone was overly excited about this guy filming their work.

Overall, I was not impressed with this film.  I have seen documentaries come and go that better showcase the trials or honesty of a production than this film did.  I felt at times the documentary felt scripted and forced to both us the viewers and the actors.  Shepard was a pit of lies as he attempted to push the idea that this was not about his life, but instead a ""father/son"" themed performance, when in actuality there was documented proof that Henry Moss was a very close representation of his father.  I wanted honesty with everyone, and I found none of it.  I had trouble seeing what the purpose of this documentary.  If it was to show how Hollywood hitters go back to their roots and learn acting 101, then so be it ... but it had to be longer.  The time of 89 minutes just didn't give me enough meat and potatoes to fully appreciate the work.  We were jumbled around between the direction, the acting, and the sub-stories that ultimately plagued this film, but not the production of the play.  There was no reason for this film and I think that Almereyda was really grabbing and hoping that he would uncover something, yet he never did.  I was unhappy with the final cut of this film and do not suggest it to anyone.  Skip it; there are better ones out there!

Grade: * out of *****",1104710400,5,4052,4.376171352074967
8356554,4,B0028O9ZFM,"Wonderful look at rehearsals in a real theatre setting.  I did not like Sam Shepard's play but this movie depicts the directing and acting part of the process up until opening night.  It was interesting watching the different styles of acting each actor lived while getting to the core of the play.  I thought the play itself, having read it, is a disjointed mess and a screaming match between characters being Shepard's way to write drama.  It's that way in most of his plays.  But I really suggest to young actors to watch this movie and study the actors creating their characters.",1513555200,,583,4.676470588235294

8356557,4,B0028O9ZFM,"Enjoyable documentary on the staging of Sam Shepard's play `The Late Henry Moss, with a star-laden cast (who are also some of our very finest actors). Some fascinating, and often funny interviews with Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Sam Shepard and others as they struggle through the artistic process. Even more interesting - at least to me- was the actual footage of the rehearsals themselves, where we can watch how a group with all this great talent slowly finds its way along with the material and each other. Indeed, if I had a complaint it would be that I would have loved more of the work process, even at the expense of some of the talking heads. A must for anyone interested in theater in general or Sam Shepard in particular.",1435968000,,727,4.6

8356559,5,B0028O9ZFM,"Came very quickly in perfect condition. Was quite inexpensive. Would go to this vender again. Shepard in rehearsal footage is fascinating. Good stuff about Nolte, Penn & Harrelson among others. Insightful about Sam Shepard's work & process, particularly The Late Henry Moss.",1396224000,,274,5.5476190476190474
8356560,5,B0028O9ZFM,I wasn't really sure if I should buy it just based on reviews.  This is one of the best docs I have ever seen.  I have viewed it five times already and keep seeing different aspects with each viewing.  Recommend for anyone who loves Sam and docs.  Shows how a play is rehearsed and everything else that goes into the production. What a perfect concept this was.  Brilliant.,1369008000,3,373,4.426470588235294
8356561,3,B0028O9ZFM,"The DVD, put out by MGM, offers no bonus features, save a few theatrical trailers for other films. The title of the actual documentary remains a mystery until very late within the film, where we get a recitation of one of Shepard's father's letters, wherein he writes to his son about `this so-called disaster' of a marriage between the playwrights mother and himself, and how none of the difficulties present in that breakup had anything to do with his son. It's an intriguing moment, but it comes so late in the film, and so far out of left field that the viewer is left wondering why Almereyda did not include the tidbit earlier in the film, and somehow expound upon it in the film? After all, if he deems it important enough to become titular, why not make it something at the core of the film, not throw it in as an afterthought? The film, after all, is about the play, and its making, and not the personal trauma that spawned it. By doing so, Almereyda sits on a fence and does not commit the documentary to either the personal insights of the creative artist nor does he reveal the process of interpreting such creativity to the masses. Thus, overall, This So-Called Disaster is not a disaster, but it's nothing of any depth and specialness either. Still, it's worth seeing, for the reasons detailed within, even if few will want to take a second peek.",1283299200,,1359,4.551020408163265

8356563,5,B0028O9ZFM,"""Moss"" is a dark, demanding piece, so the rehearsals director Michael Almereyda respectfully captures in ""Disaster"" are draining for all concerned. What transfixed this fly on the wall was how directors and actors adopt their own language in rehearsing a play--one virtually unintelligible to the layman, but to trained professionals, a pure dialect pinpointing emotion and motivation. ""Disaster"" is an absolute must for anyone interested in the inner workings of acting and the theatre.",1185753600,2,487,5.594594594594595
