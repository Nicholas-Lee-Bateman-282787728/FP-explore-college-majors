7656103,3,B01BIC00KS,"Regression is a polished and at times absorbing film, but the execution is unfortunately problematic.  Directed by the gifted  Alejandro Amenbar, whose sterling previous credits include Open Your Eyes, The Others, and The Sea Inside, the film is set in rural Minnesota in 1990.  As media-fueled Satanic hysteria captures the nation's imagination, a sheltered teenage girl (Emma Watson) charges her dysfunctional family with demon worship and ritualized sexual abuse.  Investigating the case is a veteran detective (a very solid Ethan Hawke) who, despite his initial cynicism, slowly begins to wonder if there is in fact a supernatural threat in play.  With its rain-swept air of autumnal desolation, this film is a triumph of hair-raising atmosphere, and it has an incredibly intriguing idea at its center:  the way a gesture, a claim, can inspire the type of paranoia which turns families and communities against one another.  Again and again, it threatens to become an engaged, focused, and hard-edged exploration of the Satanic-ritual-abuse phenomenon of the 1980s and early '90s (the false memories, the destroyed reputations), but it is distracted by an interlacing structure of overwrought dream sequences and this-cannot-be-real-OR-CAN-IT? misdirection.  The genre gamesmanship may render the film more commercial (though this hardly helped upon its unheralded U.S. release), but it also results in a deflating superficiality.  Another hindrance is a decidedly mediocre performance by Watson, convincing neither as a doe-eyed victim or as a potential small-town femme fatale (a polarity leaning uncomfortably toward victim blaming).",1457568000,30,1639,5.684426229508197

7656105,4,B01BIC00KS,"This is a really interesting movie that I thought at first was a crime drama mixed with a bit of sci-fi, but no, its definitely a horror movie. And I liked it, but its fairly flawed. The acting is really good, there are some excellent visuals and the story has some really nice ideas to it. At the same time the story has some glaring issues, the direction is a little uneven and in a way, the movie doesnt work. I don't like how it all wrapped up, it left me pretty nonplussed. But some of those visuals and parts of the story really stuck with me, it had some powerful moments. Shame it just couldn't all tie together as neatly. But I still dug it. 3.5/5",1455408000,3,656,4.173228346456693
7656106,3,B01BIC00KS,"Angela (Emma Watson) accuses her father (David Dencik) of molesting her. Detective Bruce Kenner (Ethan Hawke) brings in psychologist Professor Kenneth Raines (David Thewlis) who uses regression therapy and uncovers a huge Satanic conspiracy, one that has been sweeping the nation since the publication of a book on Satanism.

The film was half interesting. The problem was having lived through the 1990s while Rosanne Barr was on the cover of every tabloid, I knew exactly where the film was going, and once it got there, the film quickly fell off a cliff. The acting and script was fair. Nothing to write home about.

For me 2 1/2 stars.

Guide: F-bomb, sex, brief nudity?

BTW. There are currently organized Satanic Temples throughout the US with the largest bring in Detroit (cheap property values). The people in the church do not really believe in Satan. They are atheists who are using Satanism to irk Christians.",1454716800,,919,4.9869281045751634

7656109,2,B01BIC00KS,"Great acting does not a movie make. Great acting by Ethen Hawke abd Emma Thompson, but the plotline was a predictable,meandering hot mess. I see this title is leaving amazon soon. It won't be missed",1503964800,,198,4.685714285714286
7656110,3,B01BIC00KS,"This is a tough one. There is so much to like about this film... and then ultimately... so much to feel ""meh"" about. If you watch the trailer you might be led to believe this is a supernatural thriller/horror film couched in a police procedural. Well... sort of. Without giving away the ""plot twist"" I can just say that where this film seems to be aiming is not where it hits home. That's fine as long as the true target is something compelling and/or intriguing. For my wife and I, this one wasn't.

Director Alejandro Amenbar, whose most well-known work to date is The Others, is absolutely a talented director. This film is gorgeous with some really compelling cinematography as well as set & costume design. Almost all the actors are fantastic, led by the always reliable Ethan Hawke. He gets some serious backing from the always stellar David Thewlis. Unfortunately, Thewlis takes a bit of a back seat here and seems a bit wasted. Dale Dickey and David Dencik also both shine here. However, Emma Watson is tasked with carrying much of the dramatic load (along with Hawke and Thewlis) and she seems a bit out of her depth. This is compounded by the fact that her character is not the most likable in film history, not to mention multi-layered, nuanced and conflicted. Watson never manages to corral all the aspects of this character into a believable and/or compelling performance.

As mentioned, while this film starts out strong and seems to be leading somewhere creepily fascinating, it ends not with a bang but with more of a whimper. It doesn't strike out, but it does lead you to think it's swinging for the fences when it actually was planning to sacrifice bunt the whole time. So the viewer will probably feel a bit let down. Some may disagree and this film might appeal more to a thoughtful person who doesn't mind a story veering off into an unexpected direction. But most will feel let down or even tricked.

If you are curious about where this film goes, you can do an online search for ""Satanic Panic"" or ""Satanic Abuse Panic."" That will give you a good idea of what this film is actually about.",1503446400,,2112,4.626666666666667
7656111,1,B01BIC00KS,"This movie is complete garbage. The entire plot and everything that happens in it, hinges on the lies that Emma Watson's character tells. The other characters actually hallucinate and see the things that her character mentions. Oh, you're probably thinking, this must be a supernatural thriller. Nope. She doesn't have any demonic powers or any powers at all. Unless you call the ability to lie through your teeth with complete conviction a ""super power"". And because everything that happens in this movie is a lie, it makes the entire movie a complete and utter waste of time. Her father actually believes that he raped his own daughter, because she lies and says he did. I don't know about anyone reading this review, but I have met some expert liars in my lifetime. Never have I met someone who can lie so well, that she or he could make me hallucinate or make me believe I did something unspeakable to them, when I know I didn't. This movie is just flat-out insulting. It's as if it were written in a single sitting, without the screenwriter putting any thought into such things as plot-holes and credibility. Ethan Hawke is better than this. Emma Watson, on the other hand, is proving more and more that she peaked with Harry Potter. I only wish that a no-star rating was an option.",1502928000,,1287,4.674008810572687

7656114,4,B01BIC00KS,"***[No Spoilers]*** I picked this movie on a whim because I (1) wanted to watch a movie and (2) saw it had Emma Watson and Ethan Hawke (two actors who haven't let me down). I've seen Emma Watson in several movies---Harry Potter movies aside---which tend to be cerebral and leave me thinking for a while. I consider Ethan Hawke an underestimated actor primarily because he tends to star in B movies, but (in my opinion) carries these movies very well. This movie did not disappoint. I was pleasantly engrossed in the complex psychological investigative story line whose realism I very much appreciated. Hawke's acting carried strongly to completion and I think really fit the role. I also think Watson really fit her role and her acting was convincing to me. The overall theme and message was refreshing and nuanced. I really enjoyed watching Regression.

After watching the movie, I went onto IMDB to see what its ratings and was completely surprised at how low of a metacritic score it received. It is times like these that I think I am am either not a critical movie watcher and easily forgive mistakes. Either way, I am glad because it allowed me to enjoy this movie. Before I posted this review, I read several of the other negative reviews and I can see many of their points in hindsight, but I also noticed a lot of confusion about the story line and the overall mood of the film. I find complaints about the mood and atmosphere of the film unfounded because I thought it was fitting. Nothing pulled me out of the movie. Nothing in this movie made me suspect it was a horror film. There are horror elements---the satanic aspects---but these DO NOT define the film. It is possible that some story elements rub people the wrong way, like satanic worship and rape. If I could give advice to anyone thinking about watching this film, I'd say it is definitely a detective story worth watching. And is typical of a detective movie, you must pay attention, so no bathroom breaks without pausing the movie! And don't watch it with people that talk during movies.",1501200000,,2060,4.674931129476584

7656116,5,B01BIC00KS,"Emma is always good or better. The writing was terrible. She did more than most could with so little to work with, as did the rest of the cast. They tried to make this a powerful statement on the vulnerabilities we all have to believe in things without the evidence an objective, rational person would demand. But they got tangled up in their own uncertainties about where to take this true story. Dad actually did go to prison even as much of the case was discredited. The horror scenes were 3rd class. The sets were very good, photography excellent, the music average, and it was all too easily predictable.",1500249600,,609,4.5963302752293576
7656117,1,B01BIC00KS,"If you are an Emma Watson & Ethan Hawke fan then this one is really going to disappoint you! The only reason I watched it until the end, is that I was waiting for something to happen, hoping for the movie to live up to my expectations - I was highly disappointed!

Inasmuch as America is facing such satanic catastrophes, the story veered quite far from the actual happenings. Father being accused and convicted of ""raping"" his daughter. Mother is dead. Son ran away from home. Grandmother is portrayed as a demon too. People dressing up as ""masked demons"" (I must say the disguise made me laugh rather than scare me) and doing satanic rituals including the sacrifices and eating of newborn babies - was just nonsensical. It was somewhat b-grade and unbelievable.

I just have to add that Emma Watson gave quite a ""broken"" performance and she played the role perfectly. When you realize what is really happening, you will appreciate her performance (only good part of the entire movie).

Overall, I was not intrigued or glued to my seat - I wanted to find excuses to leave the room.",1497830400,,1082,4.654450261780105

As for the film, it was very scattered, and they touched on so many things while accomplishing a lot of nothing. While I wouldn't say it was a bad film, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it either.

7656126,5,B01BIC00KS,"Found this under horror, which is odd. This is a drama about a very terrible series of events that afflicted the UK and America simultaneously (often the case as our cultures are close). On the Isle Of Skye in Scotland every child was removed and relocated on the mainland, the stories were the same as you see here, sexual abuse, murder and infanticide. No physical evidence was ever found. In the USA the FBI conducted a forensic search of a farm and concluded a couple of things; 1. That to commit the sheer number of crimes alleged, in the manner alleged and not leave ONE piece of forensic evidence was impossible. 2. The sheer number of babies and children that were allegedly murdered didn't match the number of woman that had been pregnant (all children or stillbirths were accounted for). The diabolical torture and abuse of innocents was perpetrated by psychologists. This movie is an excellent testimony to a time of mass hysteria and the damage that was done to innocent families. Lest we forget, traditional psychology is NOT science, it's observation + guesswork. Modern forms emerging use neurology to ground theories and ARE scientific.",1490832000,2,1152,4.912820512820513

I was bbling with anticipation, to watch Ethan playing an older cop than he portrayed in Training Day, but was sad to see his character's professionalism smash by simple fear. It almost felt like the script writers were trying to channel a teenage angst in his character.  Emma Watson is placed on the movie poster, but her character's involvment in the movie is limited to the outskirts for most of the movie.

I found the narrative hard to believe, the writer(s) require limiting your grasp on reality to the sophistication of a sheltered tween. Maybe that's the target market...

7656244,4,B01BIC00KS,"A blend of genres - satanism, mystery, psychology - this film is a nuanced journey into a great mystery that occurred in 1990 in rural Minnesota.  Though perhaps a bit slow, the psychological nuance, the building fear, and the fascinating resolution make this a very worthwhile film, at least for some.

A good cop is confronted by a seemingly clear cut case of child abuse.  He sets out to investigate, uncovering first an extremely troubled family, then apparently discovering through a therapy popular at the time - regression hypnosis -  that there may be a huge satanic cult operating.  Rape, murder, even human sacrifice may be occurring in the shocked community.  The cop begins to have nightmares, unable to distinguish reality from his dreams.  He is an atheist, so denies that anything supernatural could be happening, but he can't deny what he sees.  There is a heavy atmosphere to the film, which adds to the terror.

When he finally figures out what is going on, it is really really interesting.  Because there could be many possible solutions, I do not want to play the spoiler, you have to see it to believe it.

Recommended.  Hawke is excellent as the cop, Watson is as the traumatized girl as well.",1480377600,,1215,4.788461538461538

It failed to be gripping or compelling in any meaningful way. The movie itself is well produced. Its just that the premise they chose to portray doesn't make for a good story. You can't spend three quarters of a film building us up in one direction, and then tear it all apart in the last. This isn't a plot twist. It is a non-story.

I get the point of explaining to the audience how easily-fooled the characters are by also fooling the audience, but no one enjoys being made a fool of. As a news story in the 1980s it is quite interesting even if from a purely psychological viewpoint. But the choice of trying to turn it into some sort of horror-genre detective story just didn't work for me.

7656324,4,B01BIC00KS,"All the characters in this movie are uniformly weighed down by the heavy implications of satanic abuse that are being circulated. There's not much to distinguish one person from another. Everyone strums the same ominous chord.

Then the film is uniformly shot in somber, blue-gray tones, with constant rain as its dismal background. This does give the movie a Gothic feel. But there's just too little variation in mood and temper to propel the action.

There's also a lack of realism in the speed and hauntedness with which everyone in this film accepts the fact that Satanism is afoot. There's usually more subtlety and complexity about the way a community builds to hysteria over an issue. However, the film is rescued by its final scenes. Emma Watson does a brilliant acting job as she shows her character making a chilling turn-around - and the real source of ruthlessness becomes apparent.

This movie deals with an important issue. While the use of hypnotic regression to awaken repressed memories has pretty much been exposed as an invalid technique - one can see how there's always the danger of some other pseudo-science coming forward to capture a community's imagination. This film stands as a warning against pinning all problems on a single external source - whether that be aliens, or witches, or Satan.",1475020800,,1317,4.9772727272727275

It raises important questions about truth, memory and imagination as well as being a fine portrayal of the dangers of group-think. Although it is not a conventional horror story as such, it is chilling and has numerous scenes that are frightening. What the film leaves unsaid is where its real power lies, as its darkness is all too human rather than conveniently supernatural. It is a little slow moving and the story's denouement comes as no surprise, but the film is engaging as questions of guilt and transgression confront the viewer.

7656375,3,B01BIC00KS,"This movie works okay for what it actually is: a drama exploring the real-life 1980s claims of satanic worship.  This is a well-acted, stylish film that does shed some light on why and how such claims really occurred.

The problem is that it is marketed as a horror thriller starring Emma Watson and Ethan Hawke.  In truth, it doesn't really belong in the horror genre at all (unless one stretches that genre near breaking), nor is it much of a thriller.  In addition, Watson is barely even in it; this is very much Hawke's film.  I didn't count, but I would be surprised if Watson has more than 10 or 15 minutes of screen time in total.

I watched this because it is written and directed by Alejandro Amenbar, who also wrote and directed one of my favorite horror movies, The Others.  Maybe that is why they are marketing the film as horror; that pitch did lure me in.  However, this is neither as scary nor as good as The Others.  The biggest problem is that the ending is predictable to anyone who has any recollection of the original events (and maybe even to those who don't).  I kind of remember news stories on this subject from the time, so I saw the ending coming.  As a result, the film does a good job of laying bare the emotional dynamics of the phenomenon, but it fails as a mystery.

This is recommended if you want a gritty drama about deception and guilt, and/or you are a fan of Hawke, Amenbar, or Watson.  However, if you liked The Others and are looking for another spooky mystery, this is not the movie for you.",1472601600,,1531,4.386524822695035

7656389,3,B01BIC00KS,"Regression takes us back to a dark era in America, when accusations of Satanic ritual abuse spread panic and destroyed lives. For one moment, it really seemed that Satanists lurked everywhere and were abusing literally millions. The sensational accusations may seem unbelievable now, but they were believed not only by TV talk show hosts and tabloid readers, but the police themselves. After all, those who made the accusations were sincere in most cases. The film details just how something entirely false could seem very real and deadly serious. If we look further back into history, we may wonder how the witch hunts occurred. This film gives a window into such psychology. Our only blessing may be that now there is a justice system with at least some checks on such accusations, so the modern ""witch"" equivalents were not burned or hanged at once, or tortured into confession. Science was also able to reveal the flawed psychological techniques and theories which led to this tragedy (the ""regression"" of the title is the foremost among these) so it may prevent recurrence.

The movie is situated in the early 90s when many fundamentalist religious communities across the USA were concerned with imagined Satan Worshipers and actually sent innocent people to jail, who often served years in prison.  It is loosely based on an actual case and demonstrates the power of the imagined over reality.  It reminded us of the Salem witch hunts of the 18th Century.

I had great difficulty with that factor especially given the clothing, decor, vehicles, even the absence of technology led to a genuine distrust of the movie and its message.

However, I don't agree with others that Emma Watson's character lacked depth. If anything, it had just the right amount of tension especially given the twist. All of that, for me, falls into the character she portrayed.

The subject itself is something I'd like to see explored more. This was a decade when some of the most bizarre ineptitudes of the psychiatric community preyed heavily upon our feeble minds. Perhaps a more interesting, memorable theatrical portrayal will help us preserve, and thus never repeat, this part of our nation's history.",1467504000,,860,5.006993006993007

7656577,5,B01BIC00KS,"While presiding over a divorce case in the 1990's I had a case that was exactly like this story.  Fortunately I was able to see through the dynamics of the testimony and the witness's stories.  It was my experience (as a former prosecutor) that I had concluded that the problem was the social worker's interview practices which suggested and expanded upon the facts.  This was a very real problem for law enforcement back then.  In addition, the ""hypnosis scenes are right on!  Typically persons under ""investigative"" hypnosis were usually pushed to discuss and describe the ""issues"" which supposedly gave rise to the investigation - usually sexual in nature.  The push is to ""help"" the person recall their ""repressed memories"" of the alleged incidents.  Unfortunately, due to a phenomenon known as confabulation, the hypnotized person will attempt to say whatever they think will please the interviewer.  This results not only in the creation of a non-existent memory, but the firm implantation of this ""false memory"" in the mind of the person under hypnosis.  This is one of the reasons that hypnotically ""refreshed"" memories are almost always not admissible in a court of law.  The movie did a great job portraying these problems!",1466812800,40,1233,5.08955223880597

Emma Watson wasn't as flat as I thought she would be given the reviews that I had read prior to watching the movie, but I did think that Professor Lupin...oh I mean...David Thewlis fell a bit flat for me.

A movie about the power of suggestion, about Satanic Cults of the late 80's and early 90's, and how lives can change and be ruined by all of the above.

7656819,4,B01BIC00KS,"The problem with the film (and in the reactions to it) lies not in what it is; but in what it is not. It is NOT a police procedural. It is NOT a horror film and it is most decidedly NOT a film about Satanic cults. It IS about a time in this country in our not-to-recent past when both law enforcement and the public at large went on a second series of ""witch hunts"" hundreds of years after Salem (and ruining the lives of countless individuals and their families) because they THOUGHT children were being abused by Satanic cults that in fact, never existed in the first place.

Regression is the story of a technique (it's in the title folks) used by psychologists and later taught to some law enforcement personnel, to aid in the recovery of ""lost memories"". Memories that turned out to be a product of the process itself and the reaction to it by those who were exposed.
It is a cautionary tale and an example of what happens when the imagination runs wild in the face of what appears to be scientific fact but is really, at it's core, a knee-jerk response to the mere thought that children are being abused by groups of adults to achieve evil ends or in service of evil itself.

Looked at in that light, with the understanding that the film only represents an example of the syndrome and it's process, Regression is an incredibly well thought out, well acted and well put together film. It's an inside look at what happens to good people who want to do the right thing for the right reasons who find that all their actions are based on an inaccurate premise. Because even when something looks like a duck and quacks like a duck the truth is really that it's a freaking platypus and the duck was all in your head!

WA state, to our eternal regret and embarrassment, is one of the record holders for the ultimate knee-jerk response to this process because we destroyed virtually all the lives in a perfectly respectable small town day care, it's owners and operators, employees and the children who went there along with the families who brought them in the mistaken belief that it was the well-spring of heinous crimes against children who were being used by the adults supposedly caring for them. It took YEARS, YEARS before some of these good people finally managed to clear their names and get out of jail and to my knowledge the prosecutors involved have still never admitted they were wrong.

Watch the film. Watch a basically decent man, who happens to be a detective, struggle to find the truth amidst hype, melodrama and ""supposed"" science while the people he is trying to protect and everyone surrounding them are all torn to pieces as the real truth finally reveals itself. See it in the light it is trying to shine on a part of our past that has proven, that in many respects, we are little different now from the villagers living in small towns all over the world hundreds of years ago

It is a cautionary tale that is both well-done and well worth viewing.",1464912000,2,2971,4.514869888475836

7656854,2,B01BIC00KS,"I rented it iTunes partly because I mistakenly read ""Emily Watson"" for ""Emma Watson.""  Regression wants to have it both ways:  on the one hand, only a detective (Ethan Hawke) can see the scale of the true crimes being committed.  On the other hand, the crimes are not really crimes but supernaturally caused by  . . .  THE DEVIL!  Family members have been possessed and done unspeakable things!  And then . . . the DEVIL shows up and kills them.  An it's not just the detective who knows it's the DEVIL.  Two cops do too!  SO I stop watching at that point.  The film is very competently made and acted.  I found the film's basis in ""true events"" of the 1980s tasteless given that many people were falsely accused of Stanic abuse and then convicted.  The documentary _Witch Hunt_ (1980) chronicles the stories of the victims, some of whom are still in jail.  I'd much rather watch _The Exorcist_ again.

Ethan Hawke was amazing and actually held this picture together - as a detective trying to stay impartial and unaffected as he investigates a crime that could be the result of Satanic Rituals. Based on real facts, the story builds to a satisfying revelation - but keeps you guessing all the way to the climax. Reminded me in some ways of Arthur Miller's The Crucible - and how public hysteria can often create reality. Similar messages in both that are appropriate even for today's society.

With the trailer of satanic rituals and the question of what the father does and doesn't remember, you are set up for a horror movie. As the movie begins, it continues like a horror movie, with the music and camera movement and setting. You are always wondering if there really is a supernatural element here or not. Which is why I think the director did it this way. The characters are expecting the supernatural. They are expecting to be in a horror movie. And the movie takes you with them. In the middle I wasn't sure if there was a cult or not, and not sure if I wanted the movie to have one or not.

There is horror here. A true evil that is hidden behind every corner and affects character in the movie. Some get saved, some destroyed. But if what you are looking for is a gory finish where the main character fights his way and ends up triumphing over evil-- or at least getting away-- and emerging bloody and battered from a chamber of horrors, this is not the movie you are looking for.

One of my all time favs. Don't watch it alone.",1464134400,,271,4.44
7656951,5,B01BIC00KS,".....This is a fabulous, thoughtful AND well done movie.  The story is actually a composite of many actual stories with major features matching up with historically verifiable events of two cases in the state of Washington (mostly the Paul Ingram story but features of ""Wenatchee Witchhunt"" scandal 1994-1995 in it as well). It is true horror flick. My guess is that it is too scary for most because it can happen at any time to any one (including even very good families).  In addition this movie is special due to the central actors who do a fabulous job depicting the characters they play.  Ethan Hawke plays a passionate, rough, quick and dedicated detective who seeks to imprison abusers of children.  Emma Watson plays the downtrodden victim of and abusive family involved in a satanic cult.
.....The real strength of this movie is how the depicted motivations of so many people who rally to treat fantasies as fact. This facilitates repeated untold injustices. Our popular media is saturated with hyper-sexualized images in advertising along with sensationalized news reports of shocking stories that are intended to attract and rivet watchers (and the ever shrinking number of readers) to make money. The District Attorneys running for office need emotional laden cases with quick easy convictions and with little or no need for physical evidence (and data supports that in child abuse cases this works very well). Police officers are quick to restrain and jail all ""threats"" to women and children with a vengeance because of a natural inclination to protect victims.  Police supervisors can then ask for a bigger budget to save more ""victims"" so their departments enlarge.  Therapists want clients who come for help to externalize blame and ""feel better"" about themselves.  Accusers often need someone to blame for the tragic decisions they have made in their own lives and the repressed memory produces that person.  Clergy need to assure church members that they are active in the battle against evil and will act to protect victims from satan.  All of these motivations of disparate parties have an interest in treating every accusation of incest and satanic abuse as factually true.  Finally there is the conviction and jailing of innocent fathers, who were not perfect fathers, and often willingly accept plea bargains that allow their falsely accusing children to go free.  In this movie the father facilitates a better and more comfortable life of his daughter in a church community.  The complicated confluence of motivations are depicted very very well.
.....This is not just entertainment because it is also a literary work. The main characters change as a result of the events depicted. The viewer will change too and come away with a deeper understanding of our culture and who we are. It may not be comfortable for many to think about the issues raised in the movie. Many people have been impacted by the ""recovered memory movement"" and the cultural myth of ""repressed memories"".  Those in anyway connected to accusations arising from ""repressed memories"" should see this movie as soon as possible.  The police commander (in the movie) summed it up when he stated the scariest part was not only that the crack lead detective believed the accusations, but that ""we all believed the accusations.""
......The lone weakness of the movie  that the accuser is depicted as consciously manipulating events and using suggestive techniques to foster the hysteria.  In most events the accuser herself (overwhelming majority of accusers are female) is undergoing recovered memory therapy or regression therapy and actually believes the fantasies (often while on medication.  The movie is, I think, trying to make a clear statement that the recollections and fantasies are not factual so that the point of the movie is more forcefully made. I keep the 5 star rating for what it does do so well.
 .....This movie sheds light on a very dark era in our mental health industry. The movie only lightly engages the contribution of psychotropic medications to the production of vivid fantasies but, alas, the movie already does so much.
..... Due to personal experience that stuck our family I have read over a dozen books, many dozens of articles (academic research, legal reviews and popular writings) and  viewed an extensive library of videos on ""false memories"" (""repressed memories"" or ""pseudo memories"").  When I sat down to watch this movie I was prepared to be showered with the standard media nonsense about ""repressed memories"" unlocking ""facts"" from decades earlier or some similar fairy tale. I was wrong.",1463961600,,4619,5.10079575596817

Emma Watson perhaps was underused, but, combine Ethan Hawke and David Thewlis and, they just seem to simply warrant more screen time - great chemistry between the two.

The title of 'regression' doesn't even work either.  The plot does involve 'Regression Therapy', but it seems rather forced. The whole plot seems to take place in some isolated area, where the problems are created by the characters for no reason other than to try, unsuccessfully, to push the plot along, and adding more 'mystery' to what's going on.

7656963,3,B01BIC00KS,"This movie is one of those inspired by true events that is in reality a fictional story loosely based on the issues with regression therapy that occurred in the 80s and 90s.  I typically don't have an issue with movies that create fictionalized stories from true events as even movies that are considered true stories don't always get the facts of history correct, so that isn't an issue with me here.  The story itself is ok but as others have said, this is a really slow moving one that takes a long time to get where it intends to go.  In the beginning, I thought this was going to be one of those eerie suspense filled type of movies that keep me guessing but it seems to get lost along the way and tends to bog down into something else before it concludes into a predictable ending that was easy to figure out early on.

Ethan Hawke was good in the role but Emma Watsons role was a bit bland and lacking.  The script could have been better written as the pacing really brings this movie to a crawl at times.  There are scenes that make you think this is going for the horror or supernatural element but then doesnt and goes another direction to an attempt to be suspenseful but ends up being something more mundane.  This is one of those types of movies that tries to be everything to everyone and really ends up being rather average because it lacks a clear direction in what type of movie it really wants to be as it tries to be a psychological thriller with some additional elements but ends up being a rather mediocre movie with a rather anti-climactic ending.  This movie is a decent time waster (that might put you to sleep) but isn't something profound that I will remember much about tomorrow.

7656966,4,B01BIC00KS,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Ive mentioned before that cults both fascinate and horrify me.  The thought that people can be brainwashed into believing even the most reprehensible things are acceptable is terrifying.  But cults that worship Satan are even more so.  For me, the religious aspect of Satanic Cults makes them an even more chilling organization.  This underlying fear is what drew me to REGRESSION, a recent release from Anchor Bay.  And I have to say:  this is one film that will stay with you after the credits roll.

Im surprised this film is not getting better reviews than it is.  It is a gripping thriller, but it also contains bold images of horror that will surprise and shock you.

REGRESSION is shot very well and looks great onscreen.  The production value appears high, and the mood and tone of the film are perfect.

The acting is excellent, with Ethan Hawke and Emma Watson heading up a great cast.  Ive enjoyed Hawkes performances for a very long time (going all the way back to 1985 when he was in EXPLORERS), and Watson once again proves her versatility as an actress.  They are joined by the talented David Thewlis, who is almost a screen legend, and a host of lesser-known (but no less talented) actors.

The plot of REGRESSION is where this film shines.  It is compelling and mysterious, and the fact it is based on true events (Im not sure how many liberties were taken) makes it even more so.  My sole complaint about the plot is that a couple of things are implied (pretty obviously), but then they are never confirmed.  This is a minor gripe, but it is enough to keep me from giving the film five stars as opposed to four.

Still, I greatly enjoyed REGRESSION, and I suggest giving it a look.  It is an evenly-paced horror/thriller hybrid that will make you question how well you know your friends and neighbors.",1463097600,6,1892,4.591044776119403

7656992,4,B01BIC00KS,"Well. The movie is well-done and suspenseful as a story. It is supposedly based on true events. What it is really based on is the second wave of mass hysteria that sought to sweep this issue of Satanic Ritual Abuse under the rug and label it as non-existent and a product of false memories. Yes unfortunately there were/are people who had their minds tampered with by poorly qualified therapists planting ideas in their minds, and others who simply jumped on the media bandwagon. However, that does not eliminate the fact that a variety of cults, including satanic/sadistic ritual abuse cults have existed for centuries. I have worked in mental health since the 80s to present, no, never as a therapist who did regression therapy or analysis therapy, but in activity-based allied therapy. In the course of daily activities many mental health patients rational and non-rational, psychotic and non-psychotic, have shared information about growing up in cults, being controlled and terrorized, ritual abuse, sacrifice of animals and babies, being impregnated for the purpose of providing sacrifices. You can believe this or not believe it. The highest number of these accounts was when I worked in a private psychiatric hospital in Sonoma County, California in the early 90s, where we had patients who came from not only that county but neighboring counties to the north, Mendocino and Humboldt counties,  where there were in fact many cults in existence; many were/are offshoots of the the commune movement of the sixties of which there were many in those areas. Many stories, again, believe it or don't believe it, involved highly structured and organized groups that, yes, included public officials and police departments. I have worked all over California at many different facilities but only at that particular hospital did I hear the high number of these stories and also see the high number of diagnoses of Multiple Personality Disorder, these days called Dissociative Personality Disorder, which is generally developed from extreme trauma or abuse. So, this movie wraps it all up neatly with convenient answers explaining it all and maybe that is absolutely true for this particular case it's loosely based on, but maybe it's part of the denial, I have no idea. I only know that I am a rational mental health professional who witnessed some genuinely scary multiple personality alter switching and other alarming behaviors in patients, simply in the course of doing art or social activities, not doing any sort of talk therapy, no introducing any ideas other than relaxation and stress management for coping skills which included art, communication, physical exercise, music.

7657075,3,B01BIC00KS,"My main issue with the film is that I didn't identify with any of the characters.  I didn't identify with the cop--I didn't see how easily one could get sucked into this deception; I saw how I was supposed to feel a thrill at how he fell hook line and sinker for the allegations but I didn't feel I would have done the same.  I didn't identify with the psychiatrist--he was blind to reality due to his fixation on academic psychiatry concepts but it seemed that it was borderline malpractice for him to pursue things as he did.  The victim's back story was summarized but there wasn't much empathy for her--no notion given as to why she took this path of deception.  But of course it was important that the viewer not know for sure that she was lying.  Could have been filled in at the end of the movie though.  And the movie wasn't sure if it was a horror story about evil young girls or about a phenomenon of mass psychology.  If it was about the perp's psychological maladies then they failed to focus on that much.

There wasn't much drama and little interest in the story as it was presented in this film.  I think if the filmmakers had a better focus on the point of the film, the central issue, their skill would have brought that and a lot more to the picture.",1461110400,,1268,4.3164556962025316
7657076,4,B01BIC00KS,I thought this was a pretty decent movie and I like Ethan Hawks as an actor. It was suspenseful and had you really thinking it could be possible. I liked the twist at the end.  A nice movie to watch when you don't have anything else to do. Felt sorry for the family though.,1461024000,,273,4.055555555555555

7657078,5,B01BIC00KS,"This is an important film because it shows how people, even with the best of intentions, can be deceived and deceive others as a result....I think the psychiatrist in this film called it mass hysteria.  Fortunately this story (based on a true case) discovered the truth relatively quickly.  Yes, pain and suffering resulted because of the sins exposed, but mankind has committed sin since The Fall in the Garden of Eden and will continue until Judgment Day.  We live in a fallen world and we all sin. Unfortunately, there are people who have no qualms making others' lives miserable.  I'm referring to the infamous McMartin case about a family-run day-care center where that went on for years.  A family was ruined--their reputations, their business, their finances (and savings), their community's trust,  their health, and how they spent several years in prison separated from one another.  Once branded a sexual threat, you can never get your reputation back again. Several families and their children were also damaged by false information, stories, about the ""horrors' they had been subjected to.  These all turned out to be based on misunderstandings, outright lies, a desire to keep one's new-found self-important professional status, and a reluctant to admit they had been wrong.  To this day, many of these children, now grown ups themselves with their own children, still believe the lies they lived through as youngsters. Many have lost the loving relationships and trust they once had in their own families and caregivers this this very day. Many of the psychologists admitted they had been abused as children and this was their way of making things right.  The way the children were interviewed and only shown certain ""evidence"" ""proved"" the existence of a new science of ""regressed memories."" The sentence that came out of this case that is still believed to this day is ""A child never lies about sexual abuse.""  It is also true that children believe that mice and dogs can talk to them, that they can fly, and that they are currently employed as fire fighters and policemen.",1460937600,3,2089,5.008670520231214

7657081,1,B01BIC00KS,"I was very upset with this film because it portrays a totally wrong image of what it claims is based on true events: Satanic Ritual Abuse and its secrecy. Multiple personality disorder, or dissociative identity disorder is very real and is almost always a component in the cases that this film mirrors, however the film diverts the attention off of MPD/DID and onto a fictional, simplistic ""amnesia/memory block"" which is only a millionth of a fraction of dissociation. I am very sure that the film was funded in order to misinform people and further keep the real truth about this subject hidden because it carries itself like a factual recreation of actual events and even says so at the beginning, while totally portraying a totally incorrect and minute portion of the reality that it claims to be based upon. The ""true events"" it is based off of are VERY real, but unfortunately hollywood does not like to expose too much truth, at all actually.",1460937600,6,949,4.7926829268292686

The last half has a few moments of suspense, but by then I didn't care anymore, I just wanted it over (since I knew where it was headed, and you will, too).

7657127,1,B01BIC00KS,"I wanted so badly to like this film, but just couldn't take it seriously after about an hour.  In a constant dance with realism, it tries so hard to set-up genre expectations that the cliches leave the 'reveal' at the end lacking in any real emotional punch for the audience.

Poorly written dialogue, mediocrely directed performances from otherwise very talented actors, and more overblown dream/hallucination sequences than any one film ever needs leaves me very disappointed at the end of this.  Perhaps the only bright spot for me was the atmosphere and lighting which was solid, albeit nothing groundbreaking.

The lack of confidence in the direction is what leaves me most bummed though.  While I don't find films like 'Shutter Island' or 'Prisoners' to be perfect by any means, their direction never falters in knowing the story they are trying to tell.  Regression, however, seems to be a muddy mess of style cues from both of those films, as well as many others in the horror/thriller genre.  It's very hard to care about what's going on as it unfolds.",1459296000,3,1061,4.893854748603352

7657132,4,B01BIC00KS,"Unlike other reviewers, I found this story quite compelling. The plot was intricate, convoluted, and fascinating as it attempted to show viewers the problems with regression therapy - the power of suggestion; the problems we still have today with the media - sensationalizing and twisting things for better ratings which strengthens the power of suggestion; and, how people fear and assume things they don't know much about, must be evil - the power of suggestion strikes again. Ethan Hawke delivered a wonderful and believable performance; David Thewlis was terrific, as usual; Emma Watson delivered a strong performance when on screen, wish there had been more of her!

I'm a true horror lover so I was really hoping that eventually the twists and weaving of the story which had you confused as to what was reality or not; would really be something supernatural.

I took breaks to play games on facebook, check messages and go get my hair cut, so it took me 6 hours to watch it. It was very predictable, I figured out the plot less than half-way in.  Ethan Hawke was very convincing, Emma Watson wasn't and I guess the guy that played Remus Lupin can't do an American accent.  So, if you're looking for horror, this isn't it.

I think the cause for so many bad reviews come from people expect more traditional horror rather than a tale of humanities failings. I don't want to spoil the movie but it truly satisfied me, because if Satan does exist he doesn't create satanic rituals. Anytime light is divided from dark, it becomes very easy to see and choose light.

I appreciated the movie's attempt to explore and explain real-life controversies, such as Satanism and hypnotic regression. The core of the story is pretty interesting. Cons: Emma Watson is in very little of the film, and where she does appear, she's too bland to either care about or hate. And it's unclear why she's dressed in clothing from the '50s or '60s. Some aspects of the film are messy: The story seems to jump too quickly in the first act, giving a choppy aspect and making the viewer feel like perhaps he or she missed something. Takeaway: I think I prefer Dark Places, a fairly recent film (also on Prime last time I checked) that explores a similar theme. You might want to watch both movies and see what you think.

Enjoyment of a movie requires some suspension of disbelief, and since I didn't have that, I just couldn't get into it. The tension they kept trying to build just made me impatient.
