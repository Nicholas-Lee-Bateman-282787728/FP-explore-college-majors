3692794,3,B001M6SHD8,"After reading a manga series I find myself saying ""This would be awsome as an anime"".  As for the Love Hina series, the manga out does the anime 100 fold.  First let me point out that the mangas are rated 16 an older. The reason for this is because Ken Akamatsu enjoys creating a story that has light adult humor.  This light adult humor is never SO bad that people get offended by it (its mostly only panty shots and ""convenient"" censorship) but insted find it more funny.

These 24 episodes are NOTHING like Ken Akamatsu's mangas. However, the 25th episode (the bonus episode) for some strange reason is more what I would expect from Akamatsu. Why is it that Manga's (not just Ken's) all seem to be rated one thing and the animes for those same manga's are rated something total diffrent.  Any way, yes I did purchase this because I was expecting pantie shots left, right, and all around.  I was also hopeing for the ""convenient"" censorships while the girls are in the hot springs.  It made the books 10 times funnier and was actually kinda board with the animes because they didn't have that same humor.

I gave this anime 2 stars because its a diffrent story then the books, so your not getting the same exact story word for word. I also gave it 1 star for the 25th (bonus) episode. So in total 3 stars.

In conclusion I wish they would stop takeing mangas for older teens and creating an anime for kids from it. And I wish they would stop takeing animes for older teens and creating kids mangas. If the manga is made for a kid, make the anime for kids as well. If the anime is for adults, make the manga for adults. That is all I have to say.",1276041600,,1647,4.321428571428571

3692797,4,B001M6SHD8,"I had taken some time to pick this up because it is ""all over the place""...

In retrospect it would have been a better choice to pick it up sooner...

This is good clean fun that I really think should be ""all over the place""!

1) The art is very good.
2) The story, while not remarkably original, is done well and fun none-the-less.
3) The audio is good.
4) The characters are well developed.
5) The plot could have been stronger moving somethings along a little better but overall it was solid.

There is a quality to this anime that keeps you wanting to know the truth and plot twists that make this very worth watching.

As harem anime goes this is pretty darn good.

Fan service is light on this and it is done in good taste.

Remarkably without a lot of fan service, the women and girls in this all maintain a very good balance of sexy and funny that rounds this anime out very well.

At the end of this anime you look forward to the next installment expecting to see old friends in new situations.

It is pretty warm and fuzzy like that.

Definitely one to keep for your collection.",1247702400,2,1088,4.263414634146342
3692798,3,B001M6SHD8,"This was one of the first anime series that I ever watched, and for some reason never picked up the DVDs for them. Now that I'm watching it over again, its age really shows. (Original air date is 2000) The series is great to those of you who like multiple (hot) girls wailing on a ""weak"" guy type of character. Yes, it's quite implausible, but if you're into anime for plausibility and realness, then you're in the wrong genre.

VIDEO QUALITY
The video source has so much ghosting, frame blends, and discoloration (compared to 2009 titles) that it's painful to look at, even with all your DVD player's real-time filters. The opening sequence makes my eyes explode since it has tons of frames like that. This is not the fault of FUNIMATION since I remember that the original releases (even in Japan) had this kind of odd video quality. So I must warn people about this in case you're like me and am spoiled when it comes to animation production.

PACKAGING
As this release was meant for impulse buying, the packaging isn't that great. The cardboard DVD box is quite fragile and I even grazed it when running a scissor blade through the plastic to open it. The inside is better as it has the two DVDs in thin cases with double-sided artwork of all the girls. And even the discs has them all in underwear or less without going into frontal nudity. However, mine also has printing imperfections.

If you've watched this before and are feeling nostalgic, then you might be one the fence about this. In that case, I say go ahead and get it since it's so cheap. And for those of you watching for the first time, just as long as you keep its production year in mind and not set the bar impossibly high, you'll like this series.",1244592000,14,1719,4.485623003194888
3692799,5,B001M6SHD8,"""Love Hina"" is one of my all-time favorite anime series, and one of the few that ever made me laugh out loud.  It has been quite a few years since I visited the girls at the Hinata Lodge, and I am happy to say that the series is just as fun now as it first was when I watched it eight years ago.

At first, glance, ""Love Hina"" seems formulaic. Lovable loser Keitaro dreams of success, but seems to fail at everything he tries.  Out of luck and plans, he goes to visit his Grandmother Hina and winds up the manager of the Hinata Lodge, a fantastically beautiful building with a backyard hot spring that is populated only by beautiful and feisty girls.  Keitaro, the incurable romantic, has long be searching for his ""promise girl,"" the love of his life that he knew back when he was about three years old, and to whom he promised they would grow up and attend Tokyo University (think Harvard) together, and get married.  He can't remember the girl's name, but he hasn't given up hope.  Just possibly, one of the gals at the Hinata Lodge is Keitaro's long-lost Promise Girl, and he just might find her if he doesn't get killed first.  Hijinks ensue.

The storyline is pretty typical of ""harem""-style anime series, but somehow ""Love Hina"" does everything right.  Series creator Akamatsu Ken (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Negima/dp/B001GT9DQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Negima!</a>) knows how to work an ensemble cast, giving each girl a distinct personality and story arc.  Sure, much of the hijinks comes from Keitaro doing his best only to wind up with panties on his head, or walking in on one of the girls naked, only to get a swift kick for his troubles.  That is standard Akamatsu fare. But ""Love Hina"" has some serious undercurrents and nuances that makes all the over-the-top stuff just that much funnier.

The animated series differs from the manga, which is pretty common in Japanese anime.  I love both, personally, and felt that they did some really creative things with the ""Love Hina"" anime.  One of my favorite episodes features the kendo girl Makoto in the in the flickering, black and white style of old Samurai films.  There are other homages as well, to places as various as Godzilla and Pokemon and nods to other anime series.

This release from Funimation is just great,  with nice picture and sound.  The subtitles can be a little hard to read in spots, when the white fades into the background, but that is my only really complaint.  I haven't listed to the English-dubbing because, well, I just generally don't like English-dubbing for anime.

This set collects the original twenty-four episodes of the series plus the bonus twenty-fifth episode, which was not included on the previously released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Hina-Anime-Legends-Complete-Collection/dp/B000EXOAFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Hina Anime Legends Complete Collection</a>.  The entire series is packed on four DVDs collected in slim cases.

3692801,3,B001M6SHD8,"Despite the silly picture depicting this series, it is basically an equally silly story about just-pre-college kids somehow living without any means of support in a spectacularly neat area in Tokyo. The hot-baths alone would pay more taxes each year than I made in 20 years.

But that all could be ignored if there were any real writing in the series which is little more than teenage angst.

On the other hand, there is no massive murder and death. No aliens invading the earth from outer space and feasting on human flesh. No universe saving by some uneducated boob who somehow can use mental telepathy all of a sudden to move spaceships through the light years between stars.

In short, though this does continuously make silly sex jokes, and though it doesn't have a detectable story line, it is not a bad series. It just isn't a good one either.",1235952000,3,850,4.653333333333333

3692806,2,B001M6SHD8,"Here is my 4/10 mangaupdates review for the original manga. The anime is identical, has filler episodes and no ending: Both the anime (i just glanced at it for confirmation) and manga are bad but the manga is a bit better done and just listen to me and Bennett the Sage as his Love Hina reviews are very funny and insightful. We both sure hate Akamatsu equally but dislike his Negima (3/10) more than this circle jerk so me and ecchi/harem will never be friends. No character development, no romance, no dating, no sex, thus no service i always say. I actually started to dislike the series half way through when i read it more than 10 years ago as a teenager so the art and the very first stories are the only saving grace. To think i actually played my own money for this. Ah the sins of youth but i learned and the harem genre has been dead to me ever since so thank you Love Hina for that. A good series about an actual harm would be Ooku (8,5/10) and the deconstructive Sayonara Zetsubou-Sensei (9/10) should be the final word on the genre. At least this series isn't porn in disguise but Akamatsu does yuri/loli hentai on the side too. Sigh.",1450396800,,1147,4.364485981308412

3692817,1,B001M6SHD8,"Hapless, accident-prone Keitaro becomes janitor of a dorm populated by a quintet of stunningly beautiful, but dangerously abusive women -- one of which may turn out to be his secret sweetheart who he apparently promised would attend Tokyo U fifteen years ago. The only thing this series succeeds in is putting a whole new meaning in the phrase ""love hurts."" Most of it involves Keitaro getting into embarrassing incidents with these women and getting the crap kicked out him. This happens in just about EVERY SINGLE FREAKIN' EPISODE. It gets old in no time and is just discouraging to me as a viewer. Worse still, there's nary a sympathetic character, much less one the audience REALLY cares about. I practically detested the female characters, especially Keitaro's intended sweetheart, the nasty, overly violent Naru, who comes across as one of the most intolerable, bitchiest, bad-tempered heroines ever committed to Anime. (Yes, she's as bad as the title character from NADIA: THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER in the infamous island/Africa arc and Asuka in EVANGELION.) There are occasional bits of cleverness (like a parody of the popular JRPG DRAGON QUEST), but LOVE HINA's overall nature is too mean-spirited for its own entertainment value. Even if the idea was to make this a comedy, it still falls flat. You'd have to be a masochist in order to sit through this joyless show. Matters are not helped by the dubbing, with performances that range from shrill to just plain awful, a disappointing misfire from the usually capable Bang Zoom studios. All in all, I absolutely detested LOVE HINA and I cannot recommend it. There are far better Anime shows to invest in.",1411430400,,1663,4.985611510791367

The hotel is already occupied by 5 young ladies of different nationalities.  And from there the fun begins.  I'm not going to say to much about this film or I might give away too much.

3692823,2,B001M6SHD8,"I've always thought anime best at delivering two types of story: The battle of good
sorcerers vs. evil (Soul Eater and Fairy Tail spring to mind); and comedy/romance stories,
especially if they include a touch of the magical or supernatural (Girls Bravo, Shuffle).
As a representative of this second type, I had high hopes for Love Hina, but the series fell
well short of expectations.

While often funny, and sometimes touching, the episodes were almost unconnected, and
the shortage of likeable characters hurt the series as well. While the point at which comedy
becomes silliness, and silliness stupidity, is entirely subjective, too often I felt cheated as
a promising development deteriorated into absurdity. On a number of occasions, I was ready
to give up entirely, but then there would be a moment of honest interaction between
characters, and I would be drawn to the next episode...only to be disappointed again.

While there is no fan-service whatsoever in the series (except in the ""extra"" episode), and many
of the episodes seem to be intended for an audience of eight-year-olds, I would never let a child
of mine watch this series, because the same message permeates every episode: that violence is an
appropriate response to any situation. Naru, the main female character, though she says over and
over that  there is nothing between her and Keitaro, has appointed herself minister of his morals.
If he sees, says, or touches anything of which she doesn't approve, he gets clobbered. If he
happens to be alone with one of the younger girls for any reason, he must have lured her there for
immoral purposes...and gets booted over the horizon, with no appeal, no excuses accepted. The
only complaint he ever makes is a plaintive ""What did I do this time?"" The question is never
answered.

With some series, you can say, ""Well, he deserved it, the creep,"" but Keitaro is a genuinely nice
guy, if incurably inept. He deserves much better than he gets from most of the girls (only little
Shinobu  treats him decently; in fact she is the one truly likeable character in the whole series).

With the exception of samurai girl Motoko, there is virtually no character development in the
series either; everyone else is the same in episode 24 as they were at the start.

The series runs about ten hours; I.M.O., ten minutes of pathos is not enough of a reason to sit
through the rest.",1394236800,,2388,4.8525798525798525

At it's core, the series is a combination of repetitive but entertaining humor with an underlying love story that is simplistic but quite sweet.  The original manga was aimed at younger male readers, but the anime makes the material a little more digestible for different audiences by toning down certain adolescent aspects of the manga.

Not full of nastiness, or over zealous with fan service, but a good down to earth story about a boy, his promise to a girl, his feelings for the one of his dreams and the girl who can't get see obvious. Do yourself a favor and watch this with your tenager or significant other, you will enjoy it.",1359504000,,818,4.150943396226415
3692842,2,B001M6SHD8,"I watched this anime over the last 2 days and I really am indifferent about it.  You can tell it was made for TV because most of the fan service is really edited.  It also introduced the plot in the first two episodes but never really develops the plot until the last disk.  I would say that means you get the plot in the first 45 minutes then you get nothing but slapstick antics for about four hundred minutes of the six hundred.  You do get to know more about some of the characters but that also happens mostly on the final disk.  The four hundred minutes inbetween are filled with what are supposed to be cute adventures that really have no point.  I think the writers needed to make it last and used way too much filler and tried to keep the show going longer than it should have.  As for the comedy its really just the main character getting beaten up by the different girls.  It got old really fast and soon I was struggling to get through the series just to see how it ended.  The bonus episode was the only real redeeming laugh.  I laughed twice and it also contained 90% of the fan service.  I am just glad that finally got to the fourth disk and the plot finally ended.

Likes:

The bonus episode was solid gold.  I wish all the episodes had been that good.
The girls in the show were interesting and all had different reasons for being the way they were.
The animation was good but couldn't make up for the lack of plot.

Dislikes:

Too much filler.  The plot is introduced on the first episode then dropped until the final few shows.
The writers tried to use the same lame joke over and over like the viewers are absolute idiots.  The main character trips grabs girl and gets hit then flies into the air repeatX200.
The main character never really changes or grows based on his experience.  This makes me feel absolutely nothing for him.
The plot doesnt have a clear ending at least to me.  According to the two girls at the end it might of been one of them or it could have been a completely different girl.  Does he get into Toyko U?  I guess your supposed to pick your own ending.",1358208000,,2097,4.269035532994923

3692844,4,B001M6SHD8,"I really enjoyed this anime the first time watching it, however re-watching it seems to make it a tad bit less enjoyable. On a good note I did find all the characters to be lovable, however I found Motoko's character a little bit annoying because of her ""special sword technique's"" all the time, but still kinda cute at times.",1357084800,,326,4.5423728813559325

Keitaro ends up being the manager of the dorm and falls in love with Naru, one of the tenants.

This anime is really fun. There is more comedy than you could hope for. Even though this anime is very silly, there is a very cute love story going on at the same time. The animation and the voice acting are both well done. There are also lots of great characters. The characters are all very unique and keep you wanting to watch more. I can see someone not liking Love Hina though. If you're looking to watch something serious and dramatic then Love Hina may not be for you; but if you want to escape from the drab day to day routine and laugh and have fun, then Love Hina will make your day.",1350777600,,1012,4.137055837563452

I don't think I have even had a smile once. This anime is just that.

3692851,4,B001M6SHD8,"Love Hina is based on one of the better harem mangas ever.  Ken Akamatsu told an interesting story with interesting characters, a great sense of humor, great art, and a whole lot of heart.  The anime had to without a doubt be changed some from the manga, removing alot of the fan service for broadcast, and changing things some to fit into a half hour tv show every week.  Unfortunately in doing so, some of the humor, some of the story, and some of the heart of the manga was lost.  This was inevitable.  Thankfully much of the humor, story and heart survived.  Could it have been done better?  Sure.  Is it worth watching anyway?  Definitely.

Other reviews cover the plot well, I will leave that to them.  The story is fun, the characters are awesome, the humor works very well at times.  The characters putting on the play ""Journey to the West"" for a bunch of kids was pure awesome.

My one really big complaint is with the English dub version(the discs contain both English and Japanese audio), with Wendee Lee attempting to do an Indian accent that is just painful to hear and caused me to watch in Japanese to avoid her voice(and I usually do like her voice and think she is great).",1336089600,,1189,4.449074074074074
3692852,4,B001M6SHD8,"This show is about a guy named Keitaro Urashima who's trying really hard to get into Tokyo University, because of a vague promise by a girl when they were little kids that they would meet there again and marry each other. After failing twice, he tries to devote more time studying, and ends up managing Hinata House, a dormitory for girls, while the owner, his grandmother, takes a long leave of absence.

Lots of crazy hijinks occur from the various women, who either want to beat him up, or try and hook him up with one of the other girls. And as they live together, they begin to slowly but surely appreciate Keitaro's efforts, hopeless as they may be at times, and he may or may not have found the girl from his childhood.

Overall I enjoyed this romantic, harem comedy. Knocked a star off because it doesn't have the other videos, such as the Christmas or Spring special, nor the OVA's, but the original series with almost 10 hours of entertainment (25 episodes) isn't a bad deal at this price.",1333670400,8,999,4.513812154696133

3692855,3,B001M6SHD8,"I was a bit upset when i watched the anime.
For starters, the animation is pretty sloppy, like where scenes felt rushed and the bit-rate is slow at times, compared to other shows that are out there at the time like, FLCL.
The Dubbed version by funanimation is poor cast, they should of re-done it.
The series didn't follow the manga as close to it as I liked, as were there are new characters that play an unnecessary role in the episodes, which is sort of understandable because the storyline did sort of lack plot in general.
For the actual boxset, you receive, it is relativity cheap, for what you have to pay all you get is the 2 slim cases with 4 discs, and basically no extras, like the movies, ovas, or artwork.

In the end, i'd pick it up if your a major fan of ken akutsuma, but your not getting much from the series or actual boxset.",1296345600,,843,4.26875
3692856,1,B001M6SHD8,"I believe this dvd is being market for teens. the content, in my opinion, is not right for teens and for parents who are looking for childrens programmming. the story promotes the right for girls to abuse boys or anyone for that matter without suffering any consequences. No matter what one of the girls do they always blame the boy for their actions. The girls constantly phsically abuse the boy for the actions of one of the other girls and the girl at fault always find it funny and never sets the record strait. It also shows that it is easier to have a romantic relationship with another girl than a boy, at least they don't go beyond kissing. It also promotes smoking as romantic. Maybe I was mistaken that this was for children, but parents be aware.",1287446400,6,757,4.492753623188406

I think this one is a definite ""keeper"", but probably isn't in my favorites. Though it comes very close. It is above average in most respects. Story is well written and based on the precept of childhood promises versus present feelings.

That said, this is one series that needs to be watched at least once in a life time...

However I don't think that its something that you would watch every day or every week.... it would get tiresome.

3692859,5,B001M6SHD8,"Love Hina"" is one of my all-time favorite anime series, and one of the few that ever made me laugh. It has been quite a few months since I visited the girls at the Hinata Lodge, and I am happy to say that the series is just as awesome now as it first was when I watched it 2 years ago.

At first, glance, ""Love Hina"" seems formulaic. Lovable loser Keitaro dreams of success, but seems to fail at everything he tries. Out of luck and plans, he goes to visit his Grandmother Hina and winds up the manager of the Hinata Lodge, a fantastically beautiful building with a backyard hot spring that is populated only by beautiful and feisty girls. Keitaro, the incurable romantic, has long be searching for his ""promise girl,"" the love of his life that he knew back when he was about three years old, and to whom he promised they would grow up and attend Tokyo University (think Harvard) together, and get married. He can't remember the girl's name, but he hasn't given up hope. Just possibly, one of the gals at the Hinata Lodge is Keitaro's long-lost Promise Girl, and he just might find her if he doesn't get killed first. Hijinks ensue.

The storyline is pretty typical of ""harem""-style anime series, but somehow ""Love Hina"" does everything right. Series creator Akamatsu Ken (Negima!) knows how to work an ensemble cast, giving each girl a distinct personality and story arc. Sure, much of the hijinks comes from Keitaro doing his best only to wind up with panties on his head, or walking in on one of the girls naked, only to get a swift kick for his troubles. That is standard Akamatsu fare. But ""Love Hina"" has some serious undercurrents and nuances that makes all the over-the-top stuff just that much freakin funnier.

The animated series differs from the manga, which is pretty common in Japanese anime. I love both, personally, and felt that they did some really creative things with the ""Love Hina"" anime. One of my favorite episodes features the kendo girl Makoto in the in the flickering, black and white style of old Samurai films. There are other homages as well, to places as various as Godzilla and Pokemon and nods to other anime series.

This release from Funimation is just great, with nice picture and sound. The subtitles can be hard to read in spots, when the white fades into the background, but that is my only really complaint so I Hope Funimation makes tha lovehina complete series with tha love hina movies and the bonus 25 episode ^_^ and a good release of tha complete series of negami :D",1281830400,4,2512,4.575555555555556

After taking some time away I decided to give it a clean start and try again, this time with a more open mind.  I wantched as new characters were introduced and as some that should have been were completely forgoten.

Overall, I was not impressed with this particular anime.  As the episodes rolled by, the story never really progressed and the characters never evolved.  Each episode starts with the same cookie-cutter template.",1277424000,6,674,4.669491525423729

8320608,3,B001M6SHD8,"The series itself is charming and worthy of a 4-star review, as is the packaging (even if it makes the show look more salacious than it really is), but this particular release loses a star because of the image quality of the DVDs themselves. I'd already owned Love Hina from its original 6-DVD Bandai release and bought this to save shelf space; where the quality of the Bandai release was sharp and crisp, data compression here is painfully evident, especially in shots involving pans and lots of motion. It's not necessarily unwatchable - and, sharpness aside, Love Hina isn't really a show to watch for its animation anyway - but it was a disappointing find.
