4582522,4,B0056031N2,"Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict --While I was initially disappointed to discover this Wuthering Heights wouldn't be as strikingly inventive as the main title promised, I was pleased to discover an exceptional adaptation that holds up pretty well in contrast to the previous versions (most prominently, a 1939 version with Laurence Olivier, a 1970 take with Timothy Dalton, and a 1992 effort with Ralph Fiennes). The source material can be rather tricky to deal with, as it offers an awkward framing structure (one that some versions throw out entirely) and two rather unsympathetic lead characters. While Giedroyc stumbles on occasion in attempting to deal with some of these challenges, most of what he offers is smart and involving.

One of the key virtues of this Wuthering Heights is that it attempts to offer both characters some form of empathy while also fully acknowledging that they're both basically self-absorbed jerks. To be sure, circumstances do push Heathcliffe and Cathy apart to a certain extent, but their real problems are rooted in their unwillingness to compromise their pride and/or social standing. They are incapable of sacrificing enough to earn mutual happiness, and as a way of responding they choose to make everyone in their lives miserable. They could easily be impossible to spend time with, but the performances and direction ensure that we at least understand what drives these people and even feel for them at times.

Speaking of which, the real reason to see this Wuthering Heights is the riveting performance of Tom Hardy as the troubled Heathcliffe. Hardy's solid early on as the conflicted young man in love with his step-sister, but absolutely electrifying as the calculating, embittered self-made man plotting revenge on his long-time enemies. Hardy brings so much icy passion to the role and has a few genuinely frightening moments; there's a feral anger boiling beneath the surface that threatens to burn the prim and proper period trappings to the ground at any moment. If you need further proof that Hardy deserves his newfound stardom, you'll find it in this role. Riley is capable as Cathy, but her role is a good deal thinner than Hardy's. The highest compliment I can pay her is that she manages to prevent Cathy from seeming like a supremely obnoxious human being. Impressing in supporting roles are Andrew Lincoln (The Walking Dead) as the long-suffering Edgar Linton and Burn Gorman (Torchwood) as the impossibly snooty Hindley.

Wuthering Heights arrives on Blu-ray sporting a decent 1080i/1.78:1 transfer. As with other versions of this story, there's a whole lot of lush scenery on display throughout, and the film is lovely to behold in hi-def. Detail is pretty strong throughout, particularly in terms of background detail, though some darker moments suffer from slightly heavy noise. Audio is exceptional, with an effectively moody score by Ruth Barrett and Bronte's memorable dialogue dominating the proceedings. There's nothing overwhelming or exceptionally immersive, but it's a sturdy track. Supplements are limited to some behind-the-scenes footage detailing the making of the film.

4582564,5,B0056031N2,I have been a Wuthering Heights Fan for years. I love the novel an really loved this PBS  version with Tom Hardy as Heathcliff. The two leads did an excellent portrayal of  the characters in this rather dark and beautiful drama and love story. I also thought the scenery and music was appropriately haunting. It managed to depict  a wildness by  portraying a  starkness or isolation  that is so much a part of the story.. My only complaint as others have also mentioned is the fact that they left out Heathcliffs lament to Cathy as she was dying.. In my opinion it is one of the most beautiful heart wrenching passages of Bronts's book.  I have no doubt Tom Hardy would have performed it wonderfully.  Other than that I loved the version and have watched it many times over.,1467936000,,774,4.517985611510792
4582565,5,B0056031N2,"This is my favorite version of Wuthering Heights. Tom Hardy is excellent as Heathcliff, and Charlotte Riley is an unforgettable Cathy. The two of them together are magic. ""How can I live without my life?""
Wuthering Heights is Emily Jane Bronte's masterpiece. Peter Bowker did a great job on the screenplay, although he took some liberties that slightly change Cathy's character from the one Emily Bronte intended.
Be sure to get this Masterpiece Classic: Wuthering Heights Blu-ray Original UK Version (see the lower left corner of the Blu-ray case). The other edition, the DVD edition, has a lot of scenes cut from it, including the important opening scene where Cathy says to Heathcliff, ""Let me in.""
I also recommend ""The Annotated Wuthering Heights"" edited by Janet Gezari, a very insightful and beautifully illustrated book. In addition, I recommend ""The Complete Poems of Emily Jane Bronte"" edited by C.W. Hatfield. Emily Bronte felt her poems were so personal that she didn't want anyone to read them, and was aghast when Charlotte Bronte found and read them. Fortunately for all of us, Charlotte, and her other sister Anne, encouraged Emily to have her poems published, along with Charlotte's and Anne's poems, as ""Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell"". The Bronte sisters went on to write and publish their masterpieces the following year: ""Wuthering Heights"" (Emily Jane), ""Jane Eyre"" (Charlotte), and ""Agnes Grey"" (Anne) (I personally prefer ""The Tenant of Windfell Hall"" to ""Agnes Grey"").",1451347200,5,1501,5.181069958847736

4582568,5,B0056031N2,"of all the (english speaking) ""Wuthering Heights"" filmed, this is far the most superior:  apparently the authenticity of the art direction created the environment and the two young actors (now married) developed the sense of passion ... their youth and their love/rage depicted the hormonal imbalance of the young when in love.  Tom Hardy's performance is noteworthy and underlines his ability and range of characters,  he was amazing to watch here and then in Bronson, The Warrior ... etc.",1435363200,2,490,5.177215189873418

4582570,5,B0056031N2,This adaptation of Wuthering Heights is great. Tom Hardy does an excellent job portraying the emotionally conflicted Heathcliff in a way that I feel few actors could make it believable. It is hard making Emily Bronte's complex characters real on the screen and this adaptation does an excellent job and I would definitely recommend it!,1405296000,3,335,5.109090909090909

8459013,3,B0056031N2,"Screenwriter Peter Bowker observes that although WUTHERING HEIGHTS (1847) is considered one of the great love stories in literature, it really isn't a love story. Or at least, it is many things as well. It's a story about hate, class, revenge, sibling rivalry, loss, grief, family, violence, land and money..."" He noted that the book had previously proved ""stubbornly unadaptable, the most successful version being the Hollywood picture starring Laurence Olivier, which succeeded because ""with classic Hollywood ruthlessness they filleted out the Cathy/Heathcliff story and ditched the rest of the plot. It's a great film but it does the novel a disservice.""

And so Bowker set about writing a screenplay for this two-part ITV television series. The episodes were directed by Coky Giedroyc and star Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley in the roles of the lovers Heathcliff and Cathy. The series was first broadcast in January 2009 in the US as part of PBSs Masterpiece Classic programming.

The storyline of this version begins near the end of Brontes novel. A young Catherine Linton of Thrushcross Grange discovers her cousins who live in the nearby farmhouse Wuthering Heights. Her sickly cousin Linton and the healthier Hareton are the scorned and abused young men who live with the present owner of the estate, her uncle Heathcliff. Nelly (Sarah Lancashire), the housekeeper at Wuthering Heights, narrates the story and begins a flashback of Heathcliffs arrival at Wuthering Heights.

 Heathcliff is a young orphan boy found on the streets of Liverpool by a Yorkshire landowner. Kind Mr. Earnshaw brings the boy home as a playmate for his son Hindley and his daughter Cathy. When Hindley inherits his fathers estate, he delegates Heathcliff to the stables. Cathy becomes enamored with Edgar Linton, the elegant gentlemen who lives nearby at Thrushcross Grange. and agrees to marry him. Segregated from his soulmate, Heathcliff leaves the moors.

Three years later, Heathcliff returns to the moors the day after Cathy marries Edgar. He has acquired Wuthering Heights by purchasing Lindleys gambling debts and seeks revenge on all he perceives have wronged him . He courts and marries Edgar Lintons sister Isabella. He fosters the drunken Hindleys son Hareton. Although his scorn brings misery to all including the next generation, the story returns to its beginning and ends celebrating the marriage of Cathys daughter and Heathcliffs foster son.

It took me several days to watch this very long television version. Fascinated by the extended love story, I spent some time figuring out the Hindleys, Hintons, and Haretons. And along the way I came to some conclusions about this love story, this story of soulmates. Bland cinematography, sparse settings, and uninspired costumes make one truly listen to the dialogue and ponder the circumstances. A miscast of Tom Hardy as Heathcliff, stalking about the land in boots and a red leather vest, and Charlotte Riley as Cathy, a wild, silly girl even when she becomes mistress of Thrushcross Grange, promotes a naivete that isolation provides. Heathcliff came to Wuthering Heights to live with the Earnshaws as another son. Edgar and Isabella Linton, although wealthier than the Earnshaws. were just as unworldly as they--bound by the isolated land and a limited education.

I also encountered a few other problems in this version.  Although Brontes novel includes acceptable Victorian marriage between cousins, there are no sexual scenes of lovers in bed in her 19th century novel. She probably shuddered in her grave at the thought of it. Edgar Linton, the proper English gentleman who lives next door to Wuthering Heights, is portrayed by a fairly young Andrew Lincoln who is currently the star and chief zombie killer of THE WALKING DEAD.  It is no compliment to Lincoln that one keeps seeing his ""killer"" persona.

I think Ill order and watch the Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche 1992 film version. But I hear Binoche plays both Cathy and Cathys daughter Cathy, the latter in blonde wig. Or maybe Ill just pop in the Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon 1939 version. It does depict only the first sixteen chapters of the novel and concludes with Cathys death.

But waitthe 1970 film with Timothy Dalton is just the love story, too",1503705600,,4277,5.148414985590778
