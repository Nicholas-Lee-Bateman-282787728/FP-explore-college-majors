8703501,2,B00TZE3WOS,"Considering he is a soccer player, I would have expected the Hip opener would have been great.  This is why I bought it.  It was plain yoga that did next to nothing special for the hips.",1524268800,,186,4.138888888888889
8703502,5,B00TZE3WOS,"The Gaiam yoga for athletes series is fantastic! Only 20 minutes a workout, I don't feel like the Tin Woman anymore and look forward to a gentle day. It would be a good idea to know some of the basic yoga moves like downward dog, cobra, warriors, and triangle. Kent's voice and instruction are soothing and clear. And I love all the athletes! I've been doing these almost daily for 6 months and am over 55. I often modify the pose, so as not to injure myself. Highly recommended!",1518566400,,479,4.393258426966292
8703503,5,B00TZE3WOS,This video is a hit with me and my son. We are able to do these exercises together and have fun doing them. The fact that it is a professional athlete doing the exercises helps my son to want to do it more often. All blocks of exercises are basically 20 minutes which is rather easy to do morning or night. It provides a good workout in a short time.,1515801600,,350,4.014285714285714
8703504,5,B00TZE3WOS,Great flexibility routine; I also have the dvd's with Kevin Love and Eddie George.  They seem a bit more geared to athletes than a typical yoga dvd--exactly what I'd been looking for.  Hope they put out some more!,1512518400,,213,4.578947368421052
8703505,5,B00TZE3WOS,Using it for men's college soccer team and have had very positive feedback from team members.,1501459200,,93,4.875
8703506,5,B00TZE3WOS,"So I started doing yoga to help my running. I love yoga classes, but they can get $$ and the times offered aren't always a good fit in my schedule. I bought 4 of these Giam Athletic Yoga DVDs and I am very happy that I did. I admit it can be hard to get yourself motivated to use them, at least with a class you have to be there and if you paid you don't want to waste that money. So sometimes I do struggle with using these regularly enough. It has helped having spent 2 years going to yoga classes to have a better understanding of what they are doing in the video, bc I feel at some points they go a little fast. I haven't quite gone through EVERY single sequence on all DVDs yet, but I do feel there is a bit more overlap than I would prefer, I would want more unique sequences so I don't feel I'm doing the EXACT same routine every time. But overall, these are fantastic and I recommend  them!",1496620800,,898,4.016759776536313
8703507,4,B00TZE3WOS,Pretty good dvd. Good instruction and hits different muscle groups. Will include in my rotation. Like any fitness dvd there is no magic bullet that covers everything. If you get something good out of it then it was a good buy. Overall this is pretty good it hits the areas that I personally need help on.,1436832000,2,304,4.446428571428571
8703508,5,B00TZE3WOS,"I love the Gaiam athletic dvd series. I really couldn't wait until May 5 to buy this dvd so I purchased it directly from Gaim and am happy I did.  I am an injured runner with hamstring and adductor issuues. This dvd helps the adductors. There are 5 programs, approximately 20 minutes each. So far, I've done the hip opener, 25 minutes and muscle maintenance, which is approximately 20 minutes. Kent Katich is excellent and Jermaine Jones is doing the yoga poses. Even though Jermaine Jones is a soccer star, this dvd is excellent for all athletes ans well as anyone wanting to strengthen functional muscles. This is one of my favorites.",1430956800,2,636,4.678571428571429
