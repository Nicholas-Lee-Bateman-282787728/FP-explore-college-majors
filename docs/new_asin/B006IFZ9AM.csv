8608970,4,B006IFZ9AM,"I found this look into the lives of several women as they navigate the LA acting scene a truly educational experience. Rather than coming off as some bland narrative, the ladies in the film define acting as much a vocation as it is a profession through the mini-bios and in the round interview format of the feature. The mannequinesque portrait some may have of those in the acting profession, is deconstructed as a well rounded view of the family, occupations, and persoonalities that make-up these women is showcased. I was left wanting to continue trailing the footpath of their days.

Perhaps that would make a good...Reality Show?  *ducks*

Just kidding, ladies. Thank you for this revealing look into your worlds.",1328400000,,719,4.975
