7921412,4,B00004RM43,"I bought this film as a custom made DVD at a recent horror convention I was at and checked it out right away and I gotta admit it was a little slow but it is still a good film. I love b-movies so when I seen it at a horror convention I picked it up immediately, I knew of the film and was always interested in it. In the beginning of the film I was a little worried because the dubbing seemed very off but I got used to it quick so that was a relief. In the middle of the film it does get a little slow but if you slug out like I did you get a nice last 20 minutes where the main guy faces off against the evil lift. I knew there was an American remake called The Shaft(AKA Down) which I have never seen but have heard bad things as this The Lift is a Dutch film. Funny thing is, Dick Maas who directed The Lift also directed the American version. One thing that really sucks that the film has never been released on Region 1 DVD and as far as I know there are no plans to release any time soon.

I really liked The Lift, It is a little slow at some points but overall extremely worth it sticking it out. I am really happy I picked up the custom DVD of it.",1363219200,,1156,3.816666666666667
7921413,3,B00004RM43,"This 1983 thriller/horror movie from the Netherlands has a nifty idea, playing on many people's slight discomfort with elevators (""It's a miracle Hitchcock didn't think of it first"" was a promotional slogan used for this film in New York). In this story, an elevator programmed with novel 'intelligent' software turns evil and starts killing and maiming people in various creative ways, providing some very good sequences (if you like this sort of stuff, that is; for others it is just gory and stupid). The acting by main protagonist Huub Stapel and others is very good.
Unfortunately, this movie also has some serious weaknesses. At times it is very slow. The main plot wears thin after a while and some other ideas should have been added; it seems as though the script writers went on vacation a bit too soon. Some sequences don't seem to be going anywhere, as though they had been left in the movie by mistake. Perhaps most annoyingly, there is a supposedly climactic scene towards the end where the main hero is physically struggling with the elevator (don't ask) and this scene is shot so poorly that you don't have any idea what is going on, except in the end he survives (sorry, I just had to give that away).
Having said that, if you are into this kind of movie, if you don't mind the European way of movie making and some gratuitous sex, if you can handle watching a movie on VHS, and if you like the retro-feel of a 1980's movie, then please do go ahead and watch this movie and enjoy some great scenes (including one way at the end, so don't give up).

PS This movie is available in various languages (Dutch, dubbed in English, dubbed in French) but note it's VHS, so you only get the one you order!",1325721600,,1711,4.555194805194805
7921414,3,B00004RM43,"This is one of those almost movies. The lift has some positves going for it. Dark humor, clever script, and a few creepy moments. Unfortunatly the movie is just way to talky. I found myself getting impatient while wathing the lift and I am by no means an impatient veiwer. Its one scene after another of people having conversations. I almost forgot I was watching a thriller. This is unfortunate because there is a solid movie somwhere in the middle of all this.",1313798400,,462,4.578313253012048

7921416,4,B00004RM43,"What a wonderful, little known gem. I heard this movie is a classic in Holland, which is where it was made. This movie involves an elevator company putting an experimental chip inside of an elevator in a new office building. But when a lightning strike messes up the chip, the elevator begins trying to kill the people who go up. The movie, was filmed in a real office building, which I found cool, and the death scenes are done very well,especially the part where the security guard is decapitated by the lift. Just be sure, that you don't buy this because you want to see a truly suspencful, horrific, and excellent movie, buy this for the fun of seeing a weird, kind of cool, relatively obscure sci-fi, horror film. 4/5",1263168000,3,722,4.561538461538461

My parents rented every horror flick under the sun and allowed me to watch these scary/strange films(lol!).  Yes, this whole movie is about a killer elevator due to an experimental chip from a mad scientist haha!  What's not to love!?  I own this on dvdr along with it's cover sleeve as well as artwork on disk!  This flick does have it's rememberable scenes!!!  There is an american remake of this little horror gem called ""The Shaft"".  It's not as good; sad to say.  If your a fan of odd-ball horror than get this movie!!!  It will go great along with the other cheezy 80's horror movies you own!  This needs a proper dvd release PLEASE!!!",1201219200,7,782,4.2517006802721085
