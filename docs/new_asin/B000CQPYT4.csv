2469882,5,B000CQPYT4,"If you've completed Debbie Siebers Slim in Six, then this is the workout for you. It is 75 minutes of cardio, free-weight, resistance training and ab work that will work you hard and you will definitely feel as if you've accomplished something. The warm-up and cool-down portions are good, as well. She's easy to follow and her voice isn't annoying. I like being able to turn off the music since it's not very appealing or motivating at all. She encourages proper form often and to take breaks if you need them. She also recommends a heart rate monitor which is a good idea. I have one and use it during the workout and it helps to keep me motivated to work even harder, if need be, and burn as many calories as possible. This workout is not for the out of shape person or weekend warrior.",1262217600,19,789,4.410958904109589
2469883,3,B000CQPYT4,"It is a total body workout but I found it to be too long with nothing fun to keep you going for that long. No fun motivating music, she gives you great cues and is easy to follow but she doesn't have a perky personality. It's a great total body workout, the exercises are good but it lacks energy. I will keep it but it's not one that I would be excited to do.",1342051200,2,360,3.8783783783783785
2469884,4,B000CQPYT4,"...but there is no way I would ever get rid of this DVD. I've done The Firm, Jillian Michaels workouts, Slim in 6, and P90X. This DVD, Tear It Up, is killing me-at least, it's killing my fat cells.

I'm not going to lie. I don't like the fact that it is 78 minutes long. I'm the mother of an 18 month old and I commute 45 minutes in the morning. So I have to wake up before the roosters to do this workout. What gets me out of bed, though, is that I feel so freakin' strong at the end of Tear It Up. I said before, I've done P90X and it definitely helped accumulate a lot of strength. I've never gone above 5lbs with Tear It Up and there are times I have to stop mid-set and just let my muscles recover. You use light weights but more reps which means your muscles are screaming by the time she stops and moves on to the next opposing muscle group. It's intense. But it's great. Definitely listen to your body and switch out your weights if you need to. And keep the remote handy so you can pause and get a glass of water since Debbie DOES NOT STOP from warm-up to cool down.

I would definitely recommend Tear It Up and other Slim Series products. My advice, however, is to pace yourself. If you're relatively new to the Slim Series, I would cushion this workout with Cool It Off the day before and Cool It Off the day after. Definitely listen to your body!",1335139200,14,1358,4.101503759398496
2469885,5,B000CQPYT4,"This is great for toning your whole body - and a great price!  I don't use this anymore, I've since moved on to Insanity and P90x.  I used this after my pregnancies though.",1334880000,,172,4.181818181818182
2469886,5,B000CQPYT4,OMG....I couldn't move for 2 days after the first run with this video! But I am already feeling firmer in the areas I want firmed! I do this every other day cuz it's  too intense for a daily workout. If you like Debbie Siebers....give this one a try! Get ready to sweat!,1326240000,2,270,4.1923076923076925
2469887,5,B000CQPYT4,I have been doing the Slim in 6 Series for 3 months now and wanted something new to add in. I ordered this DVD and the Keep it Up DVD. Got them both today and did Tear it Up. It is a long workout -78 minutes but worth every minute. Beginners can modify some things if needed but definitely gives you a great workout. Cant wait to try Keep it up. Love Debbie and her style.,1304380800,,372,3.9078947368421053
2469888,5,B000CQPYT4,"Great DVD. I've ordered many and I hate to say it, but only those from Beach Body really do anything. I order the old ones because they're much less expensive but just as good.",1302566400,2,176,4.205882352941177
2469889,5,B000CQPYT4,This dvd is great because Debbie Siebers has put together a workout that is so comprehensive and doesn't miss a thing! I feel this is one of the best buys I have ever gotten! A 77 minute workout that really works!  Hand weights or bands is all that is necessary.,1292544000,,262,4.24
2469890,5,B000CQPYT4,"This video is an awesome workout, though it does take a good chunk of time (approx. 90 mins).
It got me in INCREDIBLE shape! If you have knee issues, you may need to skip a couple of the exercises like I do, as they are too hard on my bad knees. VERY happy with this video!",1285459200,9,273,3.892857142857143
2469891,3,B000CQPYT4,"the workout is not easy and it does sculp ur key mucles and make u sweat a lot.
but some of the workout will cuase u to have knee pain the next day which I do not like at all",1282867200,,174,3.375
2469892,4,B000CQPYT4,"This tape and all of the slim in 6 series are excellant workouts.  I have been working out 25+ years and have done many different types of workouts.  I feel I am in excellant condition for my age, very flexible and toned.  I have been doing these dvds for a couple of weeks but my back ended up going out, not just once but twice.  I really enjoy these workouts even if they are a little long.  I ended up having to go to physical therapy and they told me that a person in their 40's just can't do the same types of excersize as someone in their 20's.  I do still use these dvds because they tone well and I always get a great workout but I have had to modify some the excersizes.",1267574400,3,680,4.0
8100562,4,B000CQPYT4,"The cons first, and they are more personal preference. Personally I find Debbie Siebers incredibly fake and annoying with a squeaky voice and incredibly fake smile. Also I don't like the music. However since I am advanced at exercising I can follow along very easily and can mute everything, pop my tunes in and not have to hear Siebers or the music anymore.

I also find it annoying that she always seems to choose back up people who have crappy form. She has to correct the male on this DVD several times because he doesn't seem to know proper form on a simple lat raise yet he loves to show off how deeply he can squat.

The pros are it is a very good workout, incredibly intense and suited for the more advanced exerciser. Exercises on this DVD include plis, rows, bicep curls, tricep extensions both overhead and in back, (no chest work), a high concentration on Good Mornings/Dead Lifts, calf raises with weights, resistance band section (I just use free weights instead), delt raises, (unilateral), burpees, stationary jumps, running in place fast and at regular speed, lunges with weights, slow lunges and regular speed; squats with weights, lat raises, back rows, kickboxing kicks, knee pulls, low knee pulls, and a very brief ab workout. I don't think the stretching section is enough so I just stretch on my own.

Sure it's a long workout but heck, I go running for over an hour as it is, the important things to remember are that you need to totally stay focused, it's easy for your mind to drift in a longer workout and it's essential to concentrate on the body part on which you are working. Proper form is a must. Form always over repetition. For people complaining it's too long of a workout there's a simple fix. Break it up in three or two sections, and live your life in between.

They seem to stick to the same 5 pound weights throughout but I push myself and use a 9 pounder on the delt  raises and 9/10 pounds on the bicep curls, etc.

So I put ol Debbie on mute and have a good workout...",1521676800,,2011,4.495890410958904
8100563,1,B000CQPYT4,Very deceptive; it was a VHS and not a DVD. It should have stated so!,1438473600,,69,3.6666666666666665
8100564,5,B000CQPYT4,Love doing this exercise.,1413763200,,25,5.5
8100565,5,B000CQPYT4,"I have been using Mix it up, Shape it up, and Tear it up for just over two months now and have to say that Tear it up is my favorite and really kicks butt. I have been exercising for 30 years and can say that this series has toned me up faster than any other workout I have used except for Yogini and Fat Burning Fusion. Yes, its that good and my body looks young and I can even see a difference in my skin! I have never been overweight and have always exercised but ageing does happen and I was noticing a few changes in my 47 year old body that still looked good but not as good as it used to so I saw the ads on TV and as I did not want to spend a lot of money on something that may not work I ordered used off Amazon and boy am I glad I did!  My waist and upper hips are down as they were thickening but not flabby. My but was flattening out a bit but two months of this has turned everything around! There are complaints that there are too many reps and the workouts are too long but this is how you recover your body and is her method. Low weights and many reps are what it takes to make you very lean without bulk and long workouts is what your body needs to make changes So if you want to see real changes I recommend you buy this. I do not find her workouts to be boring and the music is not terrible to me but suits the workout. Its like anything in life that you want-you have to work hard for it and stop blaming the workout if you are not willing to do the work. For those of us with degrees you know it does not happen overnite and neither does this. This really works if you suck it up and just do it!",1373068800,5,1616,3.8095238095238093
8100566,5,B000CQPYT4,"It is a very good workout but advanced.  If you are a beginner, probably not a good workout for you.  If you are up for a challenge, this covers all bases.",1359849600,,155,3.967741935483871
8100567,4,B000CQPYT4,"These workouts are great, but too long. I think if she cut down on some of the reps it would still be effective, but cut down on the time. I bought the whole set through Beach Body and have done a lot of thier programs. This is effective but 1 hour and 27 minutes?? Even P90X which gave me great resuls are only around 50 min. I will probably try her express workouts (only 30 min.) becuase I do like her program. In one of the workouts in this set (I can't recall which one) she must do about 500 butt tightening lifts while laying down. Sorry, but that is very excessive and annoying. I don't think you need to do that many reps of anything to achive results.",1358380800,3,661,4.131782945736434
8100568,5,B000CQPYT4,"I agree with prior poster, if you have completed Slim in 6 and Burn It Up isn't challenging you enough, THIS IS IT! It's WAY more intense, works your muscle groups that the other tapes don't. It's challenging and will make you sore, even if Burn It Up doesn't anymore for you. I love it. It is loooong but when your wanting to get to the next level of fitness, it isn't an easy road. She uses hand weights and the bands in this one as well. Burpees, planks, soreness the next day....free of charge. :)",1357171200,3,501,4.229166666666667
8100569,5,B000CQPYT4,I love  her series!  I have found this series to be very effective and motivating for me.  I thin you will too.,1357171200,,111,3.9545454545454546
8100570,3,B000CQPYT4,"This is not a work out you want to do if you are a beginner, I would say start with her Slim in 6 series first, then move onto this workout. You will be dripping with sweat, burning fat, and toning all at the same time. Arms to calves will be slimmer, trimmer and tones with this workout, and the cooldown period is great. I would recommend this workout DVD for those who need intense training, have been working out for a while and are looking for a challenge, or for those who need to mix up their regular workout routine.",1356307200,,524,4.198019801980198
8100571,5,B000CQPYT4,Love it. Very long and keeps moving. Really hard workout. I use it with my other Slim in 6 dvd's.,1349222400,,97,3.9
