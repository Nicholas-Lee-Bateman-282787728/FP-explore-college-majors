8424512,3,B004D0AMR4,"This DVD is Not to be confused with the much better and standard Documentary that was shown on PBS and had the same title,This release
is by the Director of the excellent ""Memories of Duke"",and this DVD would have made a nice extra on that DVD,
Its mostly a people talking about Duke,with clips from ""Memories of Duke's"": Mexican show footage,While nothing as good as ""A Duke Named Ellington""
or The Still Un released American experience show with the same title,Its has some interest to People who have the other programs already,The Video
isn't today's 16x9 ,but its fine 1:33,and he gets some nice interviews with friends and family,Like Duke's Sister",1303516800,16,654,4.900900900900901
