8120169,5,B000FBHCCI,"The doctoral thesis and subsequent research of Sabina Spielrein on love in the unconscious mind help me understand myself, from my greatest joys to my deepest despair, and my actions over my lifetime. I am 72 years old.  It is a miracle for me that Dr. Freud's footnote about Dr. Spielrein's thesis and her correspondence with him was discovered and revealed in films accessible to me.  Even her comments about granting freedom and independence guide me today.  I wish I had understood 30-40 years earlier than I did, but that is life.",1385769600,,535,4.793478260869565
8120170,4,B000FBHCCI,"I ordered this DVD because of another DVD I watched, I can't remember the name, but it's main characters were Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.  After watching this movie I googled Sabrina Spielrein and found out about her life.  She was indeed a real person and a patient of theirs.  This DVD was a documentary on her life and it was excellent.  Unfortunatally, she was caught up In the Holocaust.  I recommend it to anyone interested in this time period.",1365033600,,451,4.5875
8120171,3,B000FBHCCI,"Credit must be given to director/writer/researcher Elisabeth Marton who rediscovered Spielrein and her contribution to psychology, specifically psychoanalysis, especially with children.  As a Jew growing up in Russia with mental illness already in her family, Sabina began to suffer, what was later diagnosed as hysteria, at a young age.  She was subsequently sent to a clinic in Zurich under the care of Dr. Carl Jung, a disciple of Sigmund Freud.  Marton's pseudo-documentary is based on letters, diaries and other evidence discovered in 1977, written by the 3 psychiatrists.

Jung's diagnosis of Spielrein's underlying problem had to so with suppressed sexual expression.  While Marton explores this in documentary style, it never becomes lurid.  When Spielrein is cured, a relationship continues between her and the married Jung.  She writes that she wants to have his child, but it is never clear that their romance was ever consummated.  What is clear is that under guidance from Jung and Freud himself, Spielrein becomes an accomplished physician and mother.

Two actors are involved in the film to give a sense of drama, but it comes across like some of those History/Discovery Channel telecasts, but without the flare or supporting cast.  Frankly the subject is a bit dry to begin with.  David Cronenberg gives the story more life with his film ""A Dangerous Method"" from 2011.  The title comes from Sabina Spielrein's wish for an epitaph to be placed near a planted tree over her ashes.  This film is only available on DVD as of this date.",1345075200,,1548,5.1195219123505975
8120172,4,B000FBHCCI,"A true treasure to the world to have found these documents of history. I hope it proves helpful to the Phsyco-analytical world to get a foot hold back into society. Although the dvd is for the most part a documenty, there is also a love story, a love that a girl/woman had for humanity, her homeland, and of course a man. I look forward to the embelished version coming out in march, A most Dangerous Method.",1329091200,,408,4.381578947368421
8120173,3,B000FBHCCI,"The story of Sabina Spielrein is becoming more well known.  This is one of two movies on her life now.  There are several books.  As more research and scholarship is done, it is apparent that Sabina probably did NOT have a love affair with Jung as depicted in - and central to - this film.  The definitive Sabina Speilrein movie has not been made yet, it my opinion.  It seels that many people sense a sort of 'grander mystery' behind Speilrein's story when they first hear it, but this film only hints at that rather than unfolding it further.  But this attempt does what it does well.",1162684800,,586,4.429906542056075
8120174,5,B000FBHCCI,"This is a very interesting ""docudrama"" on a little known episode in the history of psychoanalysis.  It tells the story of how the young Carl Jung treated his first patient, and how their doctor-patient relationship eventually developed into a passionate love affair.  This affair was unknown until 1977, when Spielrein's diary and several letters were discovered in the basement of a building in Geneva, Switzerland, nearly thirty years after she had died.  In the film we learn how Spielrein wanted to have a child with Jung, how Jung broke off the relationship, and how Spielrein coped with his rejection.  One of the most interesting aspects of this film is how Sabina Spielrein made important contributions to the history of psychology, yet they were generally unrecognized publically by Freud and Jung.  The film tells the story by dramatic recreations, narration, authentic photographs and letters.  It is a very professionally made film, and the dramatic recreations are acted well and fit the film perfectly.  I loved this film and it is a wonderful tribute to Ms. Spielrein.  Sadly, Spielrein died in a Nazi concentration camp in 1942.  If you are at all interested in Carl Jung and the history of psychology you MUST have this film.  I saw it in the spring of 2006 in Chicago, and it haunted me for weeks.  It is a very powerful film, almost Shakespearen in mood, tone and feel.  I HIGHLY recommend it.",1158105600,,1412,4.9113924050632916
