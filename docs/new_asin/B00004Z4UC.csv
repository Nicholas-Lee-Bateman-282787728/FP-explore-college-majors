3048181,4,B00004Z4UC,"I just rented this movie the other day as the front cover boasted that it was from the makers of Iron Monkey and Legend of the Drunken Master and the story sounded cool.  Let me tell you, this film surprised me greatly in that it was nothing like what I expected but it was a brilliant piece of work.  I have never seen this many elements from different genres thrown into one film in a truly bizzare mix.  I mean, battling it out with brutal magical powers in the streets of new york?  Crazy... and the final battle must be seen to be beleived.  An excellent story, fascinating characters and ingenious direction make this an experience like no other.",1003881600,4,652,4.445378151260504
3048182,4,B00004Z4UC,"Simply put, this is a fun and very captivating movie.  Many will complain about the hard to follow story layout, but it's more of a long flashback than a Mission Impossible confusion.  The special effects are top notch making Hollywood wonder where they put all their money because this movie was made cheaply compared to anything the US puts out.
It's an action story so the occasional poor acting by some (Nicholas Tse mainly) can be forgiven.  It's nothing worse than Will Smith, so don't be scared.  But everyone else is right on with their skills.  Yuen Biao's cameos lend his real kung fu expertise.  And fans of the Hong Kong actresses will have more than special effects to stare at.  Everyone will envy Ekin Cheng's character.
Fight sequences will make any action/martial arts fan cheer.  The last battle is one for the record books.  Anyone out there wishing for a DBZ movie will be more than happy with this in its place.  The only flaws are small ones which do not ruin the experience at all.  Expect to see a great action film with an engrossing story and you won't be disappointed.",1001548800,7,1095,4.6217616580310885
3048183,2,B00004Z4UC,"As ""cute"" as Nicholas Tse and Ekin Cheng might be, even their ""pretty"" faces couldn't save this film. ""A Man Called Hero"" (the prequel to top-grossing movie in HK cinematic history, ""Storm Riders"") was a disappointment. After watching the first half, one can't even bring himself/herself to justice by finishing the second half. Although the movie does have potential with a nice love story, an attempt of flashbacks and kung-fu completely ruined the movie. Don't get ""A Man Called Hero."" Instead, get ""The Storm Riders."" - Priscilla",993686400,,533,5.137931034482759
3048184,4,B00004Z4UC,"Having finally seen ""A Man Called Hero"" after reading endless debate as to its entertainment value, I must say that overall, it was an enjoyable film. Granted there were enough flaws to fill a black hole, but it still had some excellent production values. As Andrew Lau's follow-up to ""Stormriders,"" it's hard to not to make any comparisons when many of the cast and crew worked on both movies. While the special effects didn't break any new ground, the situations were more far-fetched and befitting a comic book.
As the movie was made from another comic book by Ma Wing Shing (I haven't read any of them), it had more of a comic book feel. That is both its strength and weakness. The pacing was more fluid by sacrificing characters, reducing them stereotypes. Thankfully there was less brooding from the main characters than in ""Stormriders."" Good guys were all morally righteous and the bad guys were all venal and heinous, except for Hsu Chi, who was spared by Hero during one of the fights between Hero and the Japanese ninjas. The stereotyping of the ""foreigners"" was particularly painful, due to the black and white depictions and the contrived plot. The narrative technique of using flashbacks to tell the story grew tiresome quickly. What saved the movie was the pacing and the interspersed action sequences, but shortchanging the characters into cardboard cut-outs. Regardless, it's always good to see Yuen Biao, as limited as his role was in this outing.
The finale duel at the Statue of Liberty is totally outrageous, but it doesn't measure up to the fight where Hero and Shadow go against the Japanese ninjas. Although it's apparent that the actors are in front of a blue or green screen, you soon forget when the action goes overboard.
""A Man Called Hero"" is something that you can watch during a lazy Saturday or Sunday matinee, when you don't want to strain your brain and can suspend your disbelief with more abandon. The surprising roles were filled by Ken Lo and Francis Ng. Ken Lo seems to have broken out of his bad-guy image of being only a bruiser, playing a monk in this flick (he must have a better agent these days because he seems to be in a lot more than just Jackie Chan movies), and Francis Ng, becasue I always notice that he's left-handed (strange way of identification, I know), and that he has become more of an actor and less of a snarling reactionist. Ekin Cheng appears to have only one expression: stolid and emotionless. He's gotta do something with his hair and the same coif in all his movies. The ""Young and Dangerous"" look is way over. The opening credits with the comic book-inspired background images were great.",981936000,6,2657,4.740820734341253
3048185,2,B00004Z4UC,"Storm Riders is a wonderful movie. Ground-breaking for a HK movie. However, A Man Called Hero is one of the worst movies I have seen. Yeah, great special effects, some of the fight scenes were amazing. However, if you are not familiar with the comic book series, you will be lost.
The story jumps around, NO Character development, essentially, a piece of crap made to try and show off Centro's CGI capabilities. Big Deal.
Don't believe the hype about ""Oh...from the makers of The Storm Riders....Oh...a modern retelling of the Blood Sword saga""...crap I tell you, Everyone gave it four or five stars just because of the special effects...sigh.",973382400,11,643,4.908256880733945
3048186,4,B00004Z4UC,"A Man Called Hero was the bomb of CGI movies!  Well it would've got 5 stars except The Stormriders (same crew who made this movie) took it away!  My friends all shrugged me off when I said this is one of the movies that  would refrain you from watching The Matrix.  Man, they didn't even see this  movie yet!  SFX is great except for some fake looking parts at the ending,  story is sad and I guess was meant that way.  Ekin Cheng is my favorite HK  movie hero along with Nicholas Tse (Ekin's son in th movie)!  Plus the  finale battle is intensely climatic (man those guys save the best fight for  the last).  I love CGI battles and this is one of the best, second only to  The Stormriders!  Check it out!",967507200,4,706,4.164179104477612
3048187,4,B00004Z4UC,"Following the success of Storm Riders, Andrew Lau and his crew return in the visually stunning but choppy A MAN CALLED HERO. It was made in half the  time Storm Riders took - and it becomes painfully obvious when you try to  understand what's going on.
Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie, but  hell... It tried to do way too many things at once. There's a great deal of  characters, subplots, and confusing flashbacks (the editing could've used  work). The first half of the movie is also quite slow. But dammit, forget  the story and watch the actors and special effects.
Ekin Ching does a  good job of protraying Hero and Bad guy Francis Ng is excellent as usual  (he's such a badass). The surprising role was in Shu Qi - who is usually  protrayed as a ditzy, young, immature, and spunky girl (Storm Riders and  Gorgeous). Here, she plays a serious and quiet (!) Japanese Ninja who  becomes emotionally involved with Hero (although the movie never develops  this point... in fact, the movie never really develops anything at all).  Overall the movie has an impressive cast - although it's kinda funny to  watch the Japanese roles given to Chinese actors. Yuen Biao is also present  with a very small part.
Special effects are excellent, although I'm not  sure how to compare it with Storm Riders. The climatic fight has a little  bit of corniness and is sped up to the point of being unrealistic. When  Francis Ng calls Ekin Ching and his voice zooms through the entire city of  New York, I tripped out. Never in my life have I seen such a concept on  film. Other great moments belong to the sword fight in the rain and the run  in with Hero and the Japanese Ninjas (although the outfits were  silly).
In the end I was wondering what the hell I just watch and tried  to make sense of the story... After a while I realized that it didn't  matter - it was fun to watch and I was very satisfied with the effort put  into this production. I'll be waiting for the sequel - for now, this  Special Cut DVD was worth the money.",966816000,9,2024,4.417344173441735

3048239,4,B00004Z4UC,"After not seeing one of the plot strains resolved, I had to do a little research. This is based on a Hong Kong manhua that ran from 1980-1995. It has spawned three fairly long TV series, two in the '90's and one in the '00's.

The fact that it is based on a written story explains the plots reliable intricacy and attention to setting. The fact that it is based on a long story explains why we don't get as much of it as we would like.

The movie-writers don't really owe us anything. Their intended audience is probably well familiar with a popular story through its narrative, and are probably less jarred by unresolved plot threads. By analogy, no one is disturbed that the film Red Cliff does not tell the whole Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

3048254,3,B00004Z4UC,"I was drawn to this film because of the body of work of Andrew Lau, without the knowledge of the comic book source. For the most part I was impressed by the charisma of Ekin Cheng and the martial arts scenes that went from exciting to the supernatural. Sometimes, they entered the domain of ""Crouching Tiger"" or ""Iron Monkey,"" which is not bad company considering the source material. It was wonderful to move the story through multi-generations with consistent believability before setting in to stereotypical, racist cardboard American figures with no heart or soul akin to those found in dated ""Kung-Fu"" TV episodes. Setting that aside, whenever the action came back to early New York city scenes the film finds enough realism to rise with your expectations. It is too bad that the script writer had obviously not seen Boorman's ""Excalibur,"" which had its magical sword moving the storyline more thoroughly. Here, the red burning sword is introduced early and then shows up later without explanation, which means the viewer must read the comic first. The ultimate fight on the Statue of Liberty seems to have been attached to impress, though it disappoints as an intrusive futuristic appendage rather than as a flowing extension of the early 20s scenes.  For Shu Qi, her supporting role is well-tuned, sympathetic and brief. Any moment away from the stereotypes, the film rises. I would rate the film higher if the script had the guts to avoid the special effects finale, an obvious appeal to court the looming U.S. market. The fine acting could have risen to the challenge against a mere matte background (a la Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"")saving fantasy animation dollars more wisely spent on polishing the script.",1397433600,,1723,5.024475524475524

On the positive side, this is a martial arts film rife with all the standard soft of action you'd expect in such.  It should be noted that this is primarily a family drama and not all that much action.  I'd say it's 80% family drama and 20% combat.  it's really, really cheesy combat but combat none the less.  The real joy of this film comes from seeing all the stereotypical portrayals of Americans as viewed from the standpoint of the Chinese.  They're not all QUITE walking around in spurs and chaps but they certainly do dress alike.

To the negative, some of the scenes are just ill-constructed.  I'm talking Power Rangers bad here.  Early on we get a glowing-red obviously plastic sword that really steals a scene or two and it is an effort to suspend disbelief.  Other fighting scenes are similarly laughable but that's all part of the fun.

In summary, this is a good one to sit down with and not take too seriously early on.  The story's not half bad; you just have to decide to focus on the parts that amuse you.

3048261,4,B00004Z4UC,"Almost everyone from ""Stormriders"" is back with a new movie combining special effects, martial arts and history to a new level.

The story focuses on a man named Hero who believes that he is born under the ""Star of Death"" (everyone around him dies...friends, loved ones and foes).  One one hand he is fighting for his master, the other is getting revenge for the death of his family and last to find his kidnapped daughter.

Unfortunately, the movie doesn't answer all what I mentioned thus perhaps a sequel will be coming out.  As for the movie, I tend to enjoy this movie more than ""Stormriders"".  I actually liked the plot which has a lot of potential.  Unfortunately, like most comic book adaptions with many people, trying to throw many characters in will confuse the viewer.  Personally, some people may need to see this movie more than once to feel comfortable with it.  I enjoyed it a lot and enjoyed the different characters in the movie.  It was like a live movie of ""Tekken"" and ""Soul Blade"" mixed with ""Fist of Legend"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".

As for the DVD, this movie has to be bought on DVD.  Although the special cut has been edited for the DVD version (they removed the KKK section, a cemetery section and a few other things), the DVD is the best way to watch this movie because it looks good and sounds good.  Also, the special features available is a better offering than most HK DVD's because they actually subtitled the special 17-minute making of featurette.  Also, the inclusion of three trailers for the movie and more.

Watch this movie with an open mind and try to enjoy it.  Can't wait for the next movie!",1220400000,,1647,4.6116838487972505

3048269,4,B00004Z4UC,"Hero is a man born under an unlucky star with a terrible fortune: (Everyone close to Hero will die an unnatural death). After an assassin kills his family, Hero must flee to America to start over.
Traveling to New York to begin his new life, Hero  (Ekin Cheng) is taken to work at a mine.  Along the way, he befriends a Buddhist monk, who admires his devotion and sense of honor. Falsely accused of murder at the camp, Hero is forced to flee yet again. When Hero discovers his wife, Jade, has also come to China town, Hero risks all to be with her... With some unforeseen consequences.
 ""A Man Called Hero"" has some excellent special effects, martial arts fans will enjoy. For instance: there is a scene where Hero and the villian are battling on top of the Statue of Liberty which was really breathtaking. There were also several really cool scenes where Hero is battling in the city as well.
What really prevented me from giving this movie a five star rating was the choppy plot, and the way it was narrated. Half of the movie is told in 'real time' and the other half seems to be relayed by Hero's friend Shadow. The movie jumps from present to past, without much sense, and this was distracting. Also, the plot seemed to meander a bit, with Hero just taking what life dished out, and never doing much of anything. On the good side, Ekin Cheng was absolutely WONDERFUL as Hero, lending the role the fire it needed to breath life into an otherwise cardboard stiff character. With some editing and a decent script, I'd give this movie five stars!",1039219200,6,1547,4.498220640569395

3048271,4,B00004Z4UC,"Hmm... honestly, I was not impressed with 'Storm riders', maybe because i watched it after watching 'The Duel'. Well anyway here's the synopsis to this movie...

Ekin Cheng is one of my favorite actor. However, even he could not save this film(besides the fact that Ekin's hair is exactly like Hero from the comicbook). Despite incredible production values and an epic storyline, 'A Man Called Hero' suffers from too much exposition and not nearly enough actual storytelling. there are too many side-stories and too many characters, and they are all crammed in 105 minutes, and the results, BAD.
We meet Hero aka Wah ying-Hung primary enemy played by Francis Ng, in the last parts of the film. And nothing was built to make him and Hero's battle special. And let's talk about the final battle, it was just WAY too much.
but don't get me wrong. This movie is not complete[ly bad], with its intersting side characters and some amazing visual effects it might interest some people. So watch with caution.",1028246400,2,1281,4.800904977375565

I liked the love story and it was pretty sad at some points. The spot where the film fizzles is in terms of hero's son, that aspect of the film having to do with his son lookin for him was kind of weak. This film was not too difficult to follow so don't be fooled by the other reviews. I found the storyline a refreshing change from the staight forwardness of most action oriented films. There are two different time periods going on in the film but it is not hard to follow. I would recomend this film as a break from straight forward kung fu movies.",1016409600,,729,4.140845070422535

I am a huge HK martial arts movie fan and have been watching this stuff since I was in kindergarten. There are far better movies out there. The special effects are lame, even for time period. The statue of liberty shots were pixelated and the action totally unspired. Any Lau has made some good movies in the past, but this one isn't one. If you feel mindless and just want to watch something, it might be half way entertaining.",1006819200,2,579,4.420560747663552
3048274,1,B00004Z4UC,"For action film, I personally focus on 3 components, which are plot, action sequence and acting.
Plot=1.5 (on a scale of 0-5)
The orginal comic book offers plenty of stories to make its movie version exciting, not to mention the many sophisticated lines of dialogs.  For the movie, there is only one single story line.  And it does not make sense in some important parts of the story. For example, how can anyone let the ""evil foreman"" to even get physically close to Hero's wife when she was givin birth to the twin and let him kidnap one of the children.  Secondly, there are simply too many subplots (still along the same story line) that the screenwriter (or whoever was responsible) wanted to ""jam"" in, which makes those who did not read the comic book have a difficult time following what is going on.  Given that the movie is more than 2 hour long, the director did an extreme poor job in developing the characters, a component so crucial in the success of the original comic book series.
Action Sequence=1.5  (on a scale of 0-5)
Even though Cheng E. Kit and the rest of the young actors lack the martial arts or acrobatic trainings of Jet Li or Jackie Chan, the director should at least recruit the help from action choreographer/director like that in Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon to make up for the inadequacy.  What seems to me is the producer used computer generated effects to substitute for good, hard-core, action choreography for its own sake rather than to use it to enhance the portrayal of the characters or to add favor or excitment to the plot.  What was said by the other viewers were completely true; each of the fight scenes only lasted for 2 seconds.
Moreover, Hero is famous for his ""Limitless Palm"" (excuse my translation) in the original comic book series.  There is no mentioning of it in the movie.  The only scene that may have shown it is when Hero created a explosion when the cowboys were running toward him in the later part of the movie.  ""Limitless Palm"" is supposed to be an art that gives the power of an extraordinary physical thrust (in physics term).  An explosion like that of TNT is simply a poor portrayal.  Given that the orginal comic book offers copious supply of beautiful kung fu moves of Hero and other characters, the movie adaptation is a complete disappointment.
Acting=2.0 (On a scale of 0-5)
The only good aspect about this movie is that Ekin Cheng does look like Hero in the comic book. Other than that, the acting or the directing is extremely poor.  At the scene where Hero's wife died, I could not really tell if Cheng was crying or he was just grimacing.  In short, Hong Kong's entertainment industry has cultured a shallow taste among its audience in a way that ""a collection of pretty faces""=""good ticket selling power"".  Unlike its Hollywood counterpart, older and more seasoned actors/actresses have a very deminished role in any new movie.  The ""pretty face"" phenomenon may well bring in good profit from the young Asian crowd; however, it, together with poor plot/acting and action sequence will simply give Hong Kong movies and their audience (given that it's the top selling movie in 1999) a bad reputation worldwide.",1006387200,,3190,4.710431654676259

I have never seen this many elements from different genres thrown into one film in a truly bizzare mix.  I mean, battling it out with brutal magical powers in the streets of new york?

3282679,4,B00004Z4UC,"Simply put, this is a fun and very captivating movie.  Many will complain about the hard to follow story layout, but it's more of a long flashback than a Mission Impossible confusion.  The special effects are top notch making Hollywood wonder where they put all their money because this movie was made cheaply compared to anything the US puts out.
It's an action story so the occasional poor acting by some (Nicholas Tse mainly) can be forgiven.  It's nothing worse than Will Smith, so don't be scared.  But everyone else is right on with their skills.  Yuen Biao's cameos lend his real kung fu expertise.  And fans of the Hong Kong actresses will have more than special effects to stare at.  Everyone will envy Ekin Cheng's character.
Fight sequences will make any action/martial arts fan cheer.  The last battle is one for the record books.  Anyone out there wishing for a DBZ movie will be more than happy with this in its place.  The only flaws are small ones which do not ruin the experience at all.  Expect to see a great action film with an engrossing story and you won't be disappointed.",1001548800,7,1095,4.6217616580310885

3282681,4,B00004Z4UC,"Having finally seen ""A Man Called Hero"" after reading endless debate as to its entertainment value, I must say that overall, it was an enjoyable film. Granted there were enough flaws to fill a black hole, but it still had some excellent production values. As Andrew Lau's follow-up to ""Stormriders,"" it's hard to not to make any comparisons when many of the cast and crew worked on both movies. While the special effects didn't break any new ground, the situations were more far-fetched and befitting a comic book.
As the movie was made from another comic book by Ma Wing Shing (I haven't read any of them), it had more of a comic book feel. That is both its strength and weakness. The pacing was more fluid by sacrificing characters, reducing them stereotypes. Thankfully there was less brooding from the main characters than in ""Stormriders."" Good guys were all morally righteous and the bad guys were all venal and heinous, except for Hsu Chi, who was spared by Hero during one of the fights between Hero and the Japanese ninjas. The stereotyping of the ""foreigners"" was particularly painful, due to the black and white depictions and the contrived plot. The narrative technique of using flashbacks to tell the story grew tiresome quickly. What saved the movie was the pacing and the interspersed action sequences, but shortchanging the characters into cardboard cut-outs. Regardless, it's always good to see Yuen Biao, as limited as his role was in this outing.
The finale duel at the Statue of Liberty is totally outrageous, but it doesn't measure up to the fight where Hero and Shadow go against the Japanese ninjas. Although it's apparent that the actors are in front of a blue or green screen, you soon forget when the action goes overboard.
""A Man Called Hero"" is something that you can watch during a lazy Saturday or Sunday matinee, when you don't want to strain your brain and can suspend your disbelief with more abandon. The surprising roles were filled by Ken Lo and Francis Ng. Ken Lo seems to have broken out of his bad-guy image of being only a bruiser, playing a monk in this flick (he must have a better agent these days because he seems to be in a lot more than just Jackie Chan movies), and Francis Ng, becasue I always notice that he's left-handed (strange way of identification, I know), and that he has become more of an actor and less of a snarling reactionist. Ekin Cheng appears to have only one expression: stolid and emotionless. He's gotta do something with his hair and the same coif in all his movies. The ""Young and Dangerous"" look is way over. The opening credits with the comic book-inspired background images were great.",981936000,6,2657,4.740820734341253

The story jumps around, NO Character development, essentially, a piece of crap made to try and show off Centro's CGI capabilities. Big Deal.

3282684,4,B00004Z4UC,"Following the success of Storm Riders, Andrew Lau and his crew return in the visually stunning but choppy A MAN CALLED HERO. It was made in half the  time Storm Riders took - and it becomes painfully obvious when you try to  understand what's going on.
Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie, but  hell... It tried to do way too many things at once. There's a great deal of  characters, subplots, and confusing flashbacks (the editing could've used  work). The first half of the movie is also quite slow. But dammit, forget  the story and watch the actors and special effects.
Ekin Ching does a  good job of protraying Hero and Bad guy Francis Ng is excellent as usual  (he's such a badass). The surprising role was in Shu Qi - who is usually  protrayed as a ditzy, young, immature, and spunky girl (Storm Riders and  Gorgeous). Here, she plays a serious and quiet (!) Japanese Ninja who  becomes emotionally involved with Hero (although the movie never develops  this point... in fact, the movie never really develops anything at all).  Overall the movie has an impressive cast - although it's kinda funny to  watch the Japanese roles given to Chinese actors. Yuen Biao is also present  with a very small part.
Special effects are excellent, although I'm not  sure how to compare it with Storm Riders. The climatic fight has a little  bit of corniness and is sped up to the point of being unrealistic. When  Francis Ng calls Ekin Ching and his voice zooms through the entire city of  New York, I tripped out. Never in my life have I seen such a concept on  film. Other great moments belong to the sword fight in the rain and the run  in with Hero and the Japanese Ninjas (although the outfits were  silly).
In the end I was wondering what the hell I just watch and tried  to make sense of the story... After a while I realized that it didn't  matter - it was fun to watch and I was very satisfied with the effort put  into this production.

The fact that it is based on a written story explains the plots reliable intricacy and attention to setting. The fact that it is based on a long story explains why we don't get as much of it as we would like.

The movie-writers don't really owe us anything. Their intended audience is probably well familiar with a popular story through its narrative, and are probably less jarred by unresolved plot threads. By analogy, no one is disturbed that the film Red Cliff does not tell the whole Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

3282751,3,B00004Z4UC,"I was drawn to this film because of the body of work of Andrew Lau, without the knowledge of the comic book source. For the most part I was impressed by the charisma of Ekin Cheng and the martial arts scenes that went from exciting to the supernatural. Sometimes, they entered the domain of ""Crouching Tiger"" or ""Iron Monkey,"" which is not bad company considering the source material. It was wonderful to move the story through multi-generations with consistent believability before setting in to stereotypical, racist cardboard American figures with no heart or soul akin to those found in dated ""Kung-Fu"" TV episodes. Setting that aside, whenever the action came back to early New York city scenes the film finds enough realism to rise with your expectations. It is too bad that the script writer had obviously not seen Boorman's ""Excalibur,"" which had its magical sword moving the storyline more thoroughly. Here, the red burning sword is introduced early and then shows up later without explanation, which means the viewer must read the comic first. The ultimate fight on the Statue of Liberty seems to have been attached to impress, though it disappoints as an intrusive futuristic appendage rather than as a flowing extension of the early 20s scenes.  For Shu Qi, her supporting role is well-tuned, sympathetic and brief. Any moment away from the stereotypes, the film rises. I would rate the film higher if the script had the guts to avoid the special effects finale, an obvious appeal to court the looming U.S. market. The fine acting could have risen to the challenge against a mere matte background (a la Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"")saving fantasy animation dollars more wisely spent on polishing the script.",1397433600,,1723,5.024475524475524

3282756,4,B00004Z4UC,"I picked this movie because it looked lonely on Amazon Instant Watch.  At first I had my doubts but by 20 minutes in I was glad that I did.

So this is a multi-generational revenge/drama/romance film.  Some innocent people are killed, a son goes in search of revenge in America.  We don't hear much about it until his own son shows up in America almost two decades later.  Eventually fighting and the standard expected stuff ensues.

On the positive side, this is a martial arts film rife with all the standard soft of action you'd expect in such.  It should be noted that this is primarily a family drama and not all that much action.  I'd say it's 80% family drama and 20% combat.  it's really, really cheesy combat but combat none the less.  The real joy of this film comes from seeing all the stereotypical portrayals of Americans as viewed from the standpoint of the Chinese.  They're not all QUITE walking around in spurs and chaps but they certainly do dress alike.

To the negative, some of the scenes are just ill-constructed.  I'm talking Power Rangers bad here.  Early on we get a glowing-red obviously plastic sword that really steals a scene or two and it is an effort to suspend disbelief.  Other fighting scenes are similarly laughable but that's all part of the fun.

In summary, this is a good one to sit down with and not take too seriously early on.  The story's not half bad; you just have to decide to focus on the parts that amuse you.

3282758,4,B00004Z4UC,"Almost everyone from ""Stormriders"" is back with a new movie combining special effects, martial arts and history to a new level.

The story focuses on a man named Hero who believes that he is born under the ""Star of Death"" (everyone around him dies...friends, loved ones and foes).  One one hand he is fighting for his master, the other is getting revenge for the death of his family and last to find his kidnapped daughter.

Unfortunately, the movie doesn't answer all what I mentioned thus perhaps a sequel will be coming out.  As for the movie, I tend to enjoy this movie more than ""Stormriders"".  I actually liked the plot which has a lot of potential.  Unfortunately, like most comic book adaptions with many people, trying to throw many characters in will confuse the viewer.  Personally, some people may need to see this movie more than once to feel comfortable with it.  I enjoyed it a lot and enjoyed the different characters in the movie.  It was like a live movie of ""Tekken"" and ""Soul Blade"" mixed with ""Fist of Legend"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".

As for the DVD, this movie has to be bought on DVD.  Although the special cut has been edited for the DVD version (they removed the KKK section, a cemetery section and a few other things), the DVD is the best way to watch this movie because it looks good and sounds good.  Also, the special features available is a better offering than most HK DVD's because they actually subtitled the special 17-minute making of featurette.  Also, the inclusion of three trailers for the movie and more.

Traveling to New York to begin his new life, Hero  (Ekin Cheng) is taken to work at a mine.  Along the way, he befriends a Buddhist monk, who admires his devotion and sense of honor. Falsely accused of murder at the camp, Hero is forced to flee yet again. When Hero discovers his wife, Jade, has also come to China town, Hero risks all to be with her... With some unforeseen consequences.
 ""A Man Called Hero"" has some excellent special effects, martial arts fans will enjoy. For instance: there is a scene where Hero and the villian are battling on top of the Statue of Liberty which was really breathtaking. There were also several really cool scenes where Hero is battling in the city as well.
What really prevented me from giving this movie a five star rating was the choppy plot, and the way it was narrated. Half of the movie is told in 'real time' and the other half seems to be relayed by Hero's friend Shadow. The movie jumps from present to past, without much sense, and this was distracting. Also, the plot seemed to meander a bit, with Hero just taking what life dished out, and never doing much of anything.

Ekin Cheng is one of my favorite actor. However, even he could not save this film(besides the fact that Ekin's hair is exactly like Hero from the comicbook). Despite incredible production values and an epic storyline, 'A Man Called Hero' suffers from too much exposition and not nearly enough actual storytelling. there are too many side-stories and too many characters, and they are all crammed in 105 minutes, and the results, BAD.
We meet Hero aka Wah ying-Hung primary enemy played by Francis Ng, in the last parts of the film. And nothing was built to make him and Hero's battle special. And let's talk about the final battle, it was just WAY too much.

This film was not too difficult to follow so don't be fooled by the other reviews. I found the storyline a refreshing change from the staight forwardness of most action oriented films.

The statue of liberty shots were pixelated and the action totally unspired. Any Lau has made some good movies in the past, but this one isn't one.

3282771,1,B00004Z4UC,"For action film, I personally focus on 3 components, which are plot, action sequence and acting.
Plot=1.5 (on a scale of 0-5)
The orginal comic book offers plenty of stories to make its movie version exciting, not to mention the many sophisticated lines of dialogs.  For the movie, there is only one single story line.  And it does not make sense in some important parts of the story. For example, how can anyone let the ""evil foreman"" to even get physically close to Hero's wife when she was givin birth to the twin and let him kidnap one of the children.  Secondly, there are simply too many subplots (still along the same story line) that the screenwriter (or whoever was responsible) wanted to ""jam"" in, which makes those who did not read the comic book have a difficult time following what is going on.  Given that the movie is more than 2 hour long, the director did an extreme poor job in developing the characters, a component so crucial in the success of the original comic book series.
Action Sequence=1.5  (on a scale of 0-5)
Even though Cheng E. Kit and the rest of the young actors lack the martial arts or acrobatic trainings of Jet Li or Jackie Chan, the director should at least recruit the help from action choreographer/director like that in Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon to make up for the inadequacy.  What seems to me is the producer used computer generated effects to substitute for good, hard-core, action choreography for its own sake rather than to use it to enhance the portrayal of the characters or to add favor or excitment to the plot.  What was said by the other viewers were completely true; each of the fight scenes only lasted for 2 seconds.
Moreover, Hero is famous for his ""Limitless Palm"" (excuse my translation) in the original comic book series.  There is no mentioning of it in the movie.  The only scene that may have shown it is when Hero created a explosion when the cowboys were running toward him in the later part of the movie.  ""Limitless Palm"" is supposed to be an art that gives the power of an extraordinary physical thrust (in physics term).  An explosion like that of TNT is simply a poor portrayal.  Given that the orginal comic book offers copious supply of beautiful kung fu moves of Hero and other characters, the movie adaptation is a complete disappointment.
Acting=2.0 (On a scale of 0-5)
The only good aspect about this movie is that Ekin Cheng does look like Hero in the comic book. Other than that, the acting or the directing is extremely poor.  At the scene where Hero's wife died, I could not really tell if Cheng was crying or he was just grimacing.  In short, Hong Kong's entertainment industry has cultured a shallow taste among its audience in a way that ""a collection of pretty faces""=""good ticket selling power"".  Unlike its Hollywood counterpart, older and more seasoned actors/actresses have a very deminished role in any new movie.  The ""pretty face"" phenomenon may well bring in good profit from the young Asian crowd; however, it, together with poor plot/acting and action sequence will simply give Hong Kong movies and their audience (given that it's the top selling movie in 1999) a bad reputation worldwide.",1006387200,,3190,4.710431654676259
3282772,4,B00004Z4UC,"After seeing Storm Riders for the first time. I wasn't very anxious to see ""Man called Hero"". Storm Riders was good mind you,
but seeing it on VHS and dubbed made it unappealing. After seeing a man called Hero on DVD, I was definitely surprised how good it was, the special effects was cutting edge (for Hong Kong movies) and it literally kept me on the edge of my seat. Ekin Cheng does an excellent job as Hero Hua. The movie left some questions unanswered. But what the hell, it was extremely entertaining.",1004227200,,508,4.473118279569892
