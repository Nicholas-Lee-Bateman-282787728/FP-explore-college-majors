8306682,4,B001GQJH2Y,I got these for my grandchildren (2 sets) a couple of years ago and they are still using them.  At first every once in a while one of the children would be an animal - and this could last for a week or more - doing the graceful motions of that animal over and over - now they are making up story dances of animals and their moves and use the tape for reference.  One happy Grannie - that's me!,1355011200,5,393,3.9
8306683,4,B001GQJH2Y,"Unique, wish there was more t'ai chi and yoga for kids out there.  I thought this was kind of cool, but my 2 1/2 year old didn't care for it.  Might need repeated attempts to familiarize him.

2011 Update:
Son is 5 now & he'll tolerate watching it when his 3-yr old sister watches it. She likes it. :)

2012 Update:
3-yr old daughter LOVES this. We'll do the T'ai Chi together (helps that I took a class & have a better idea of what the movements are.) I think she likes the animal costumes, whereas my son didn't.",1234310400,10,514,4.161616161616162
