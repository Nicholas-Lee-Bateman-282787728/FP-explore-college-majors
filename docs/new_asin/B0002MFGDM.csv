8029305,1,B0002MFGDM,"The trilogy is a good one, I mean The heretic is a terrible movie but part I and III are really great movies, we all know them. The problem is that the description says Latin as a language so not sure how does it mean, is Latin like Spanish Latin or the Latin spoke like thousands of years ago?. But only part II which is the worst came with Spanish captions, the other two movies are only in English, maybe you are thinking ""but this guy is writing the review in English!!!"" the problem is that I purchased this for my brother... Epic fail!!!",1361318400,2,543,4.230769230769231
8029306,5,B0002MFGDM,"One of my most fav. of all time Horror films. Watever they made as a sequel wasn't that good, but the first part still creeps me out when I watch it. The Exorcist is on my top list of my All Time Fav. movies. You can't miss on that one !!!!",1350259200,,240,3.7254901960784315
8029307,5,B0002MFGDM,"A must have for the Excorcist genre film collector. Its digital picture and sound are excellent and the behind the scenes bonuses are well worth it. Having the entire collection in one set is the best way to man your shelves, and having them handy for your entertainment. The movies are classics. Two thumbs up.",1272240000,,311,4.672727272727273
8029308,5,B0002MFGDM,"YOU GET ALL THE ORIGINAL FILMS. THE BEST OF COURSE IS THE EXORCIST, THE VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN. WHICH HAS DIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY, WHICH IS GREAT. 12 MINUTES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO MISSING SCENES FROM THE ORIGINAL 73 VERSION. I SAW BOTH THE ORIGINAL AND THE 2000 VERSION WHEN THEY CAME OUT. I COULD COMPARE BOTH VERSIONS. THIS IS THE BEST. BETTER SOUND QUALITY. BETTER VISUAL EFFECTS. THIS FILM WAS FILMED IN NYC IN AN AIR CONDITIONED STUDIO. THE ACTORS ARE ACTUALLY FREEZING. IT'S NOT LIKE TITANIC, THAT DIGITAL VAPOUR WAS ADDED. THIS IS THE REAL THING. EVERYONE HAS LAYERS OF CLOTHING, EXCEPT POOR LINDA BLAIR. SHE ONLY HAS A NIGHTGOWN, NOT FAIR. ALL IN ALL A GOOD BUY. THANK YOU",1181260800,4,678,4.658333333333333
8029309,5,B0002MFGDM,This is a really well priced set for a great trilogy of movies.,1093132800,,63,3.923076923076923
8029310,5,B0002MFGDM,"I watched all the exorcist movies on TV long time before and I would like them to join my DVD collection. I bought the Exorcist III at a very special low price. Then I was waiting for the Exorcist I and II on sales for big discounts. Wait & wait....never ever happens. On the other hand, Exorcist 0 'The Beginning' is coming soon in August and I would like to re-watch all the previous exorcists before my adventure of 'The Beginning'. Thinking for a while (it's a couple months long thought), should I buy Exorcist I & II? Hmm......Bingo! I got the news that Warner Home Video is going to release the 3-pack trilogy on Aug. 17. at a very low price. Whew~~ I pre-ordered it right away.

This 3-pack trilogy is a great news to all Exorcist fans who hasn't owned the full DVD sets yet. Even though there's no extra features or fancy box set wrapping around them, I think the attractive low price for this 3-pack is the huge factor for driving people's desire of ownership. Besides, all of three Exorcist I, II, III, are the great movies in horror film history. I think this 3-pack is an excellent deal!
