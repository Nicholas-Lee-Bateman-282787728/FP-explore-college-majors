7854469,3,6303816363,"I ordered nude yoga and what I got had a preview of what would be on the yoga tape but the rest of the tape was nude stretching, which was O.K. if it meant the entertain and not really teach anything. I believe that a few house wives with a camcorder could do better.",1055635200,,267,3.962962962962963
7854470,4,6303816363,I was tired of the same old fitness tapes.  Thought why not learn yoga in the buff?  The simplicity and pace of this video helped me understand the various poses and positions. The female narrator has a great soothing voice.  The attractive ladies are helpful and visually easy to follow in each yoga lesson.  Some people may think this is a silly video.  I found this approach to yoga professional and motivating.  My husband seems to like it too.  I'm glad we bought it.,977529600,11,472,4.5476190476190474
7854471,3,6303816363,"When I began my yoga practice it was with fully clothed instructors. Some days I just couldn't get motivated to put the tape on and do the practice.  After watching the nude women I began to join in. It's sort of a motivational video and a workout. There is lots silicone and one girl wears socks for awhile but the models are nice to look at. The video quality on the tape was terrible (forget about it) but it is acceptable on the DVD version.  There is instruction on the yoga portion that is pretty good, not the best, but okay. (A woman's voice dubbed in talking about yoga asanas.) The yoga models sometimes present the pose incorrectly as if they really don't know how to do yoga. I liked the Tai Chi too except that it lacks any instruction. You can see the models trying to follow someone leading them. As I said, this is more of a motivational program than instructional. Or maybe it's just soft porn. It has a little of both.",962323200,,936,4.3428571428571425
7854472,3,6303816363,"Everyone seems divided on this one.  ""It stunk""  ""It was great""  Truth is, It's OK.  The models (4 of 'em, though 2 look very similar) are attractive (6-8.5), but they do look like they have never done  the positions before (ie. very wooden; -1 star).  Looks like a couple of  them have had some ""work"" done, but I have seen a lot worse in  magazines.  It lost 1 star for me because of the picture quality; again, I  have seen a LOT worse in other adult features, but I have seen a LOT better  too.  Overall, not too bad; if you want to see some attarctive women do  yoga naked, get it.  Your humble honest evaluator, Joker J",960508800,6,625,4.186440677966102
7854473,4,6303816363,"This was a very interesting tape...I was expecting more a ""hippie/new age"" angle when I ordered it.  However, the tape actually stars 4 nude models who go through some very basic yoga positions.  Most of the shots  are done close-up, focusing on one model at a time.  Most of the time, the  camera focused on the models breasts and pubic hair (with a few shots of  genetalia taken while the models were bending over).
Overall, a good  tape for sexual arousal;  O.K. for learning basic yoga positions.",925776000,6,500,4.666666666666667
7854474,4,6303816363,Nude Yoga video was very relaxing to learn from.  My wife and I did not mind the bare instructors.  We learned many yoga positions and have used the tape many times as a daily guide.  The women are pretty cute too.  END,880156800,3,219,4.142857142857143
