7466181,5,B016BSRDGI,"This movie has always been one of my guilty pleasures.  If you are a B-Movie horror fan, how could you not like a movie with Bela Lugosi, George Zucco, and John Carradine in the cast..despite the crazy plot and low budget?  This Blu-Ray version is beautiful----crystal clear quality.  You will never see it look better.",1453420800,5,319,4.763636363636364
7466182,5,B016BSRDGI,"Best print I've ever seen for this Monogram programmer!  It's a hilariously bad film, but at least everyone appears to be having fun.  Prior to this release, a few collector's DVDs and a Riff-Trax DVD have been released from mostly substandard prints.

The print is not absolutely pristine, but isn't far from it.  I don't know how this film got preserved but I'm glad it did and that it's out on blu.",1451865600,7,401,4.527777777777778
7466183,5,B016BSRDGI,"If you've always wanted a good copy of VOODOO MAN then look no further. The Olive Films release is what you've been waiting for. Clean, crisp image with no cuts. Hopefully, Olive will unearth more of these Katzman/Lugosi horror epics. This one has John Carradine as Lugosi's nitwit servant and George Zucco running a gas station. What more can you ask?",1449360000,19,352,4.786885245901639
7466184,3,B016BSRDGI,"This review is of the transfer, not the film. Picture and sound quality are fine, but the movie is presented totally windowboxed (thick black bars on all four sides), which substantially reduces the size of the picture. The framing is approximately 1:1, not 1.33:1 (full screen) listed on the case. This reduces considerably one's enjoyment of the presentation. Why, Olive Films?",1449273600,13,379,5.229508196721311
7466185,5,B016BSRDGI,"Olive Films Blu-ray is a huge improvement over Legend's release of ""Voodoo Man"". Nice clear picture & sound. Excellent!",1449100800,9,119,5.315789473684211
8736180,4,B016BSRDGI,"Pretty interesting 1940s voodoo-zombie picture. Lugosi plays a doctor who has good looking women kidnapped along a certain road. When a woman is kidnapped who is a cousin to the woman he is going to marry,a reporter starts investigating. Lugosi plays a doctor who with the help of a voodoo priest trys to transfer the kidnapped womens souls into his dead wifes body. The attempts always fail resulting in the need for more women. John Carradine plays an idiot who serves lugosi.the Zombies are the beautiful women who Lugosi kidnapps and are eye candy not scary zombies.the dvd is short 62 minutes but the story is interesting and time flys by watching it. The dvd was made by monogram studios a company known for their cheap productions but i still found it enjoyable",1517356800,,768,4.7819548872180455
8736181,5,B016BSRDGI,"It's a fun B film with big name actors Bella Lugosi, George Zuccor, and John Carradine. Story is good, if not predictable. Picture quality is slightly washed out and faded, but I suppose this is the best copy around of this rare film. Recommended.",1497830400,,247,4.636363636363637
8736182,5,B016BSRDGI,"AMAZON, PLEASE - for benefit of future purchasers, for DVD and Blu-ray: would someone at Amazon please correct the way Amazon  lists this title of Voo Doo to read Voodoo - then purchasers will be able to see this title with all other versions of this disk when searching for the movie, as this Olive Films version has the best quality picture, etc. - thank you. Picture and sound are good quality; prompt shipping - thank you!",1497657600,,426,4.532467532467533

8736184,5,B016BSRDGI,"I don't like the ""hopeless horror trash"" review - this is a fabulously weird, very entertaining old black and white b-movie with wonderful performances by all the greats involved.  The story is crazy and bizarre, and it is a perfect film to see late in the night with the images blending into your dreams as you fall into a stupor...",1485043200,,333,4.55

8736189,5,B016BSRDGI,Astounding and eye opening upgrade of this old favorite of mine.  Throw away the Rifftrax version and get this.  I saw things in this gorgeous print that I had never seen in the many many times I have watched this film.  You can now tell the brand of fan belts Zucco is selling in his country gas station office!!,1454371200,4,313,4.271186440677966
