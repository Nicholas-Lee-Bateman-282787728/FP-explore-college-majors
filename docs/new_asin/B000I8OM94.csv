2653520,1,B000I8OM94,"Warner has long been the studio that put out quality product, but lately something really bad has happened to their quality control, at least with regard to DC comic characters.  First they release the first Justice League Unlimited set with episodes in the wrong order and an audio glitch in the English soundtrack of one episode.  Now they put the serial collection out on defective disks.  I had been looking forward to this set for a long time and resisted the impulse to buy a bootleg copy on ebay because I knew this set was coming out.  What a disappointment to find it defective.  Right in the very first chapter of the first serial, as Jor-El is finishing his speech to the council on Krypton, the picture and sound breaks up and pixilates obliterating the picture and dialogue for about 15 seconds as the council votes.  It does resume normalcy after that, but I don't know if the problem recurs anywhere else as I stopped watching at that point.  At first I thought I just had a defective copy so I exchanged it for a new one.  But the same problem occured at exactly the same spot on the second copy.  I exchanged it again, this time with less optimism, because experiance has shown me that when this happens on more than one disc it means the whole pressing run is defective.  Sure enough, the same problem occured at exactly the same spot, so I know it isn't my DVD player.  As I refuse to except this from a legitimate release I simply returned the third copy for a refund.  It's sad when a bootleg copy is better than the official studio release.  It's even more sad that Warner has let it's quality control go to hell.  Most of the other reviews for this DVD were written BEFORE the DVD even came out, so if you haven't bought this set yet be forewarned.  You're likely in for a big disappointment.",1165190400,17,1815,4.457575757575758
2653521,5,B000I8OM94,"Whatever the future holds for the world's greatest superhero, 2006 will surely be remembered as one of the greatest times in history to be a Super-fan.  In addition to the terrific Superman Returns, we've seen a real ""return"" of the character to our t.v. screens as well.  With the release of these serials, we now have ALMOST every filmed version of the Man of Steel at our fingertips (still M.I.A.: the cool 60's animated series).

I'm too young to have seen serials play in the theaters back then, but what a treat it must have been!  These admittedly low-budget adventures were packed with action and interesting characters.  Much has been said about the money-saving animated flying effects, but I still think they're cool.  These things were designed for the big screen and aimed at kids. . .not for today's superior digital clarity and the ability to freeze a single frame of film with the push of a button.

Of the two serials, ATOM MAN is clearly better.  For one thing, it affords Superman much more screen time.  Often in the first serial, Supes would perform some heroic deed (like saving Lois or another character from the previous week's cliffhanger) and then disappear for the rest of the chapter.  The other benefit of ATOM MAN is that it features Lex Luthor (though only his surname is used), something the (admittedly better) George Reeves series didn't manage in six whole seasons.

Since the Superman serials have been largely unavailable for years--and can now BOTH be purchased for less than what I paid for ONE of them on VHS some 10 years ago--this a great opportunity for fans to complete their collections.",1164758400,9,1632,4.813620071684587
2653522,5,B000I8OM94,"These serials have rarely been shown on TV except on only a couple occasions.  This was Superman in his earliest form.  Here you can actually see Superman literally leap from comic book page, to animated hero, and finally to live action hero. Kirk Alyn is the oldest and most forgotten Superman, and time has all but erased his presence from the collective memmory of the public.  His Superman was one of savy intellect and smarts and was a true trail blazer for the actors that would don the legendary suit later.  Together with Noel Niel (the worlds first live action Lois Lane) they follow an usual band of crooks and villians that are far more entertaining and carismatic than the run of the mill crooks that plagued the TV series.  This is the silver screen gems of yesteryear that any true Superman fan simply must pick up, simply for it's historic and entertainment value alone.  Many have greatly criticized these serials for the animation but fail to realize that these serials were produced on the slimmest of shoe string budgets because at the time they were made they were viewed as a kids film short only.  Superman had not yet achieved the fame and world wide acclaim that he now has.  The wholecast is very colorful and entertaining and these shorts will certainly give you thrills that are evry bit as exciting as the later movies and shows despite their lack of technology.  Don't waste another minute, buy Superman: The 1048 and 50 serials Collection Now!",1164067200,7,1473,4.72265625
2653523,4,B000I8OM94,"The 'live' introduction of the Man of Steel, Kirk Alyn's ""Superman"" serials of 1948 and 1950 are often treated as 'poor relations' to George Reeves' television series, and the many subsequent incarnations of the character, which is unfair; these productions were, in fact, the most successful movie serials, EVER, and hugely popular, when released, which makes this DVD collection a 'must' for every Superman fan!

With the character firmly established in American pop culture (Supes had already been around for a decade in comics, a top-rated radio series, as well as the legendary Fleischer cartoons), audiences had a clear 'image' of what he looked like, and what he could (and couldn't) do. This proved a mixed blessing for Columbia Pictures, which produced the series; while it could pattern the 'look' after the previous versions (with the film serials building on the Bud Collyer radio interpretation of Clark/Superman), the very tight budgets and primitive special effects of the time kept his super powers at a minimum (although, in fact, the rotoscoped, animated 'flying' effects would have been VERY expensive to produce, today!) Fortunately, it was an era when audiences were used to using their imaginations to 'fill in' the gaps (thanks to radio), so what we see today as 'drawbacks' weren't major obstacles, at the time.

Kirk Alyn, 38, slender, mop-headed, and dynamic, offered a more two-dimensional portrayal in the lead than his successors, but had a sheer enthusiasm that is irresistible. He clearly loved his super powers, grinning as villains 'tested' his invulnerability, and handled the 'long-john' uniform with aplomb, even when his cape interfered with his fight scenes! Noel Neill, at 28, continued the 'look' of the cartoon Lois Lane, with more energy than she'd display in the television series; Tommy 'Butch' Bond, 21, a snap-brim fedora planted squarely on his head, was no threat to Jack Larson as Jimmy Olsen, but Pierre Watkin, 59, was an excellent Perry White (and, in fact, was the choice to replace John Hamilton, who had passed away, had a seventh season of the ""Adventures of Superman"" been filmed).

While the first ""Superman"" serial was routine (if VERY successful), ""Atom Man vs. Superman"" was quite remarkable, with a few 'live' flying shots attempted, some of the cliffhanger endings are quite imaginative, and Lyle Talbot, one of film's best villains, makes a very convincing Luthor, laying the groundwork for Gene Hackman, Sherman Howard, Kevin Spacey, and Michael Rosenbaum's interpretations.

""Superman - The 1948 & 1950 Theatrical Serials Collection"" finally gives this long-neglected chapter of the Man of Steel Saga it's due, and should be an 'essential' in your collection!",1163808000,59,2725,5.257471264367816
2653524,2,B000I8OM94,"Warner Home Video delivers value for money by including both ""Superman"" serials in this four-disc collection. However, the Columbia chapterplays were low-rent Sam Katzman productions with a plethora of stock footage and embarrassing animated flying sequences. (There was no excuse for the cost-cutting, since Republic had the opportunity to produce a first-rate Superman serial in 1940 - a project turned down by DC Comics. Undaunted, Republic found another comic-book hero and made the far-superior ""Adventures of Captain Marvel."") Kirk Alyn certainly looks like the Man of Steel, but his performances lack the power and charisma of George Reeves. Though popular with Saturday Matinee audiences, DC kept both serials out of circulation for years due to the low-budget shortcomings. ""Atom Man vs. Superman"" remains the better Columbia effort - thanks to Lyle Talbot's memorable Lex Luthor, faster pacing and considerably more action.

SERIAL RATINGS:

2653525,4,B000I8OM94,"How lucky are we to finally be able to enjoy these two classic Superman serials now available on DVD. These have long been around on bootleg VHS or home-burned dvds, with poor picture quality and sound. The home-burned dvds I got off Ebay did not have the capability to fast forward or rewind, and were not formatted chapter-per-chapter. It's possible that only the die-hard Superman fans and fanboys alike have ever seen Kirk Alyn's portrayal of Superman. Most people think that George Reeves was the first screen Superman not realizing that there were two complete chapter serials starring Alyn as the Man of Steel long before the iconic tv show of the 50s.

That being said, this is a real delight to watch! The fanboys, to this day, continue to cry over the fact that in these serials, Superman's flying sequences were animated. Okay, so it wasn't the high-tech CGI of today's production capabilities. If you're able to get past that, you can enjoy these serials for what they are; pure escapist fun! It's a comic book that's come to life! Kirk Alyn's Superman is not like George Reeves' or Christopher Reeves' or anyone else who ever donned the cape and tights. You've got to see him and judge for yourself. His portrayal of Clark Kent is a little more ""mild-mannered"" in keeping with the character from the comics, and that's nice to see. Tommy Bond, who played ""Butch"" in the ""Our Gang"" and ""Little Rascal"" shorts is awesome as Jimmy Olson. For me, the real delight was Noel Neill as Lois Lane, the FIRST screen Lois Lane! She was about 27 or 28 when first cast as Lois and she is just too darn cute! She's absolutely adorable with her big hat that she wears in nearly every scene. She's assertive and risk-taking, just like the Lois in the comics of that era, while still remaining feminine. Her Lois Lane of these serials are night and day from her Lois Lane of the tv show and once again, it's very interesting to see both and make the comparison yourself.

The first serial, has Carol Forman, as the Spider Lady. The 1950 Serial, Atom Man Vs. Superman is a better serial than the first one in my opinion. The production values and the writing are a little better and more developed than the first. The flying sequences were still animated but there were ""close-ups"" of Alyn flying, which were actually him standing upright with his arms extended over his head and the camera laid over on its side to give a horizontal effect. Lyle Talbot's Lex Luthor/Atom Man is great! Talbot was a veteran screen and television actor and many fans will immediately recognize him as Police Commissioner Gordon from Columbia's 1949 chapter serial, ""Batman & Robin.""  In fact, if you're a fan of old movie serials in general, you'll recognize some of the faces of the actors who play Luthor's goons and thugs from other serials. One of the Atom Man's chief lackeys is an actor who is Dr. Daka's henchman in Columbia's 1943 chapter serial, Batman...too cool!

These serials were made on shoe-string budgets in 1948 and 1950 and weren't meant to be more than what they were. They weren't designed to be big screen blockbusters, and they were made for the kids of that time. We've become so sophisticated and demanding of ""our"" superhero movies, that to me, it seems to quite unfair to deride these two works because of shortcomings with special effects, writing or even the acting. Indeed, how lucky we are to finally be able to enjoy these two classic Superman serials now available at long last on dvd! ENJOY!!!",1161043200,188,3504,4.683441558441558

2653527,5,B000I8OM94,"This DVD should contain all the episodes for the movie serials of Superman (1948) and Atom Man v. Superman (1950). These first attempts to do a live action man of steel were a disappointment to fans because, whenever Superman flew, the movie cut to a cartoon version of Superman. So you got to see an animated Superman fly through the air, land behind a rock, and then the live action Superman, played by Kirk Alyn, would run out from behind the rock. We had to wait until the Christopher Reeve before the technology was good enough for us to really believe a man could fly.

That said, I'm sure these serials will thrill die-hard fans of Superman. I paid a pretty penny to buy used copies of these serials on VHS tape. Now I can get them on DVD. Hooray!",1158278400,27,754,4.385714285714286

2653534,5,B000I8OM94,"A fun DVD set to watch. Kirk Alyn (Superman), Noel Niell (Lois Lane) and Tommy Bond (Jimmy) do a great job of character interacting and role playing. For those who can only envision the George Reeves, Noel Neil, Jack Larsen connection, this set should open your eyes to the fact that the ""original"" Superman cast was quite loveable too. The BIG surprise to me was Kirk Alyn's interplay with Noel Niell and in particular his well timed ""mischievous"" humor.  I've always been a George Reeves fan but, Kirk Alyn's rendition is now the more enjoyable one for me. Finally, Tommy Bond is hilarious as Jimmy if for nothing more than he's always getting ""punched- out"" by a bad guy. It's a good cast giving a very credible performance! The use of cartoon animation for Superman's flying scenes is a little odd but considering the time period it's forgivable. The only unnecessary distraction is the voice narration ""this is a job for Superman"" prior to every flying scene.

2653556,5,B000I8OM94,"As a pre-teen awaiting the grand premiere of the 1948 Superman serial at my local theater, I never dreamed I would someday own dvds of these two serials. It was indeed a huge wish that finally came true. I remember attending the 1982 Memphis Film Festival in which guest, Kirk Alyn who portrayed the first onscreen Man Of Steel, had planned on bringing his own newly obtained personal 16mm copy to screen for the festival goers. Unfortunately, Mr. Alyn had to cancel his appearance after receiving a last minute communication, that screening the serial would constitute a copyright infringement without the authorization of Columbia Studios. Understandably, Kirk Alyn did not want to risk having this recently acquired serial in which he starred, confiscated after trying for many years to not only obtain a copy, but to just merely view it. Just imagine, Kirk Alyn, a star of two of the most financially successful serials ever, not ever getting to watch these classics again until around 1982 ? Perhaps Columbia failed to realize, had they allowed Mr. Alyn to screen the 1948 Superman to the festival crowd, it may have created a very huge demand to have the two serials released on videocassette (the format at that time) which in turn, could have helped Columbia obtain even larger profits?? When first released, Superman and Atom Man Vs Superman packed theaters with both young and old alike. After their initial run, the two serials seemed to have disappeared from the face of the earth for many years...as if to have never existed. The fact they were no longer available for theatrical screening created an almost cult-like mystique among collectors craving for their re-emergence. I hope these dvds are around for many years to come for the benefit of forthcoming generations.",1440288000,2,1784,4.989932885906041

I prefer the George Reeves show over this because he accomplishes something in each episode. If I was a kid in 1948 I would run out of good things to say about this but I can only recommend this to someone who's a big Superman or Comic Book fan who is even slightly interested in seeing the first hero on screen",1440028800,,518,4.19

Especially the best Lois Lane of them all Noel Neal , playing the part in both Serials before she replaced Phylis Coates on The Adventures of Superman.

I have yet to watch Atom Man vs Superman but I'm sure I will enjoy it very much. From a cultural stand point I love watching these serials for the morality lessons that they convey, the clothing styles of the era and the automobiles.

Atom Man VS Superman, Just as great as the first serial. I can just imagine kids flocking to the theaters every Saturday to see the next chapter. Those must have been great days.

2653576,4,B000I8OM94,"Kirk Alyn makes for a pretty spiffy Man of Steel and his Clark Kent is foppish fun, without being a total dip. The two movie serials are offered here in their entirety. The first gives us Superman's backstory and pits him against a pretty bland, uninspiring villain: The Spiderlady. Bleh. The second serial introduces Lex Luthor (a nice turn by Lyle Talbot), and is much more in keeping with the spirit of the comics and the later TV series. These are both a lot of fun, and while he's a little less serious than other Men of Steel, Kirk Alyn is such a joy to watch that you just go with it. The flying scenes are all animated courtesy of Fleischer Studios and, while nicely done, they're so jarring that it instantly pulled me out of the moment every time Supes took flight. Still, that's the way it was back then.

These are a good bargain and of genuine interest to fans of the character, comicbooks and superheroes in general. Younger viewers may be turned off by the dated feel and effects. Neither adventure is in the same class as the far-superior serial, THE ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN MARVEL, (perhaps the pinnacle of movie serials, especially superhero-based ones), but even so these two SUPERMAN serials are harmless, lightweight fun. The video & audio are quite impressive given the age of the material and the fact that chapter-film/serials are often treated like the baggage class citizens of the motion picture industry. There are instances of dust & dirt throughout, but nothing awful like jumpcuts or raggedy splices. The sound is in solid mono and appears to have been cleaned up a bit. Only extra is a retrospective piece called ""Saturdays with Superman"" which touches on the creation & making of these two serials. At least they give Kirk Alyn a fair shake here. He's often ignored, put down or given the brush off in later Superman documentary stuff, which is a shame. Kirk was the first motion picture Man of Steel and I think he did alright by the character.

I thought I would giggle at the primitiveness of it all - the high-waisted trunks, the almost ""fey"" pantomime to show Superman taking off to fly (Kirk Alyn was a Chorus Boy on Broadway - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Alyn), the cheap special effects (Superman turns into a cartoon when he flies), Los Angeles' Cityscape used as ""Metropolis"" rather than New York, etc.  What I didn't expect was that I would be engrossed in the storyline as well.

These serials were never made for grown-ups; in fact, when they were made, grown-ups were folks who had actually grown up and who went to grown-up movies, a phenomenon that rarely happens among 20-40 year-olds today. I can tell you from personal experience how much we loved these old serials. When I was 7 years old, in 1950, I saw 15 chapters, one a week, of Atom Man vs Superman at the Lamar Theater in Memphis, Tennessee, and I absolutely loved it. My friends and I and a whole theater full of kids, real kids, looked forward all week long to Saturday afternoons for the next chapter. We talked about it all week long and I never heard, even once, anybody gripe about Superman's flying sequences being animated. In fact, I never knew anyone who knew or cared that they were animated. We cared about the thrill and excitement of our Superman. We donned our bathrobe capes during the week and became our hero. And you know what else? Except for the occasional, very rare Mom, we didn't see anybody over about 12 in the theater. So unlike today's brain stunted 28 year-old, wearing a costume, standing in line for a kid movie. To you gripers and non-believers: these movies were never made for you. They were made for the real kids of 60-70 years ago who believed in the stories and characters; for we who loved them.

2653632,4,B000I8OM94,"Superman has always been and will always be my favorite comic book super hero.  So the serials ""Superman"" and ""Atom Man Vs. Superman"" have always been the hardest Superman adaptations for me to review.  From the time that I first learned of their existence  (from the back pages of ""Famous Monsters of Filmland"" magazine) and long after I had started watching George Reeves's TV series I longed to see them. It wasn't until Superman's 50's anniversary and Warner's video release of them that I got a chance to do so.  While there is lot good in both serials and no matter how much I wanted to love them I found both were a bit disappointing.

Superman released by Columbia Pictures in 1948 was made in the dying days of the serials and can be seen as the format's last great moment. Columbia serials were rarely made with the same quality of a Republic serial or even a Universal ones of the times  and Superman is no exception.  What it has going for it is its faithfulness to its source material (something Republic never bothered with) and it is presented in a very straight forward manner.  There is none of the camp elements that creep-ed into the color episodes of the 50's TV series and all but destroyed the 60's Batman series.  It opens with the familiar tale of the destruction of the planet Krypton, the escape of the baby Kal-El, his landing in the farm lands of Smallville, growing up there and ultimately leaving for Metropolis where he becomes Superman (Kirk Alyn).  From that point on the serial deals with Superman's battle with the Spider Woman (the very bland Carol Forman) who come across more as a lounge/ B Girl instead of a master criminal and her crime organization over procession of the the all powerful weapon the Reducer Ray. Superman/AKA Clark Kent is aided in his tasks by the comic's familiar supporting cast Lois Lane (Noel Neill who would also go on to play the part from the second season onward of the TV series), Jimmy Olsen (Tommy Bond former Our Gang bully Butch who plays the part as Butch all grown up) and Daily Planet editor Perry White (Pierre Watkins).

The often criticized animated flying scenes are a draw back for the serial but after a while you do get use to them.  The major problem with the serial is how un-engaging the over all plot and Forman's villain are.  Sadly Alyn doesn't do well as Superman either.  Its not just that he doesn't seem physically suited to the role he lacks the force and power that Clayton ""Bud"" Collyer's vocal performance brought to the role of Superman for many years on the radio and the easy going charm of his Clark Kent.  Alyn's Superman comes across as an actor trying too hard in the both roles. Surprisingly both Alyn and Forman would reunited in Columbia's last comic adaptation ""Blackhawk"" where they both performed much better as hero an villian.

The whole cast returns in 1950's ""Atom Man Vs. Superman which is the better of the 2 serials due to its stronger villain in Luthor (well played by Lyle Talbot).  Note: In 1950 Luthor was only known as Luthor; he didn't get the first name Lex until the early sixties.  But Atom Man Vs Superman suffers from the cheapness of the production reusing all the animated flights of the first serial and tons of stock footage.  There is one great scene where the animated Superman swoops down, picks up a toy truck that Lois Lane is knocked out in and flies it away in front of stock footage of an on coming flood.

These two serials can be truly seen as the bridge between the classic animated Superman shorts of the 1940's because of its over use of animation in not the just the flying scenes but in the bullets bouncing off the chest, the crashing through walls, rocket ships and flying saucer moments and the fully live action Superman TV series of the 50's.

I purchased this DVD collection even though my VSH tapes are still holding up well more for the superior packaging and the wonderful extras included. Even with the flaws found in the actual serials this is a release that every Superman fan should want to have.",1341273600,2,4055,4.580912863070539

Kirk ""Superman"" Alyn played ONE of many sailors from Portugal--- DID have a speaking part, but NOT in English.

Well, anyway this has plenty of faces that'll make you scratch your head:

It is 1948---the year before I was born---,and, NOEL NEILL, probably not much older than 25 is a cute little boogger in hats almost as big
as herself. This IS B&W, so, hopefully she didn't have that Lucille Ball-Red hair like the final season of ""THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN""...
when she's STILL Lois, and pressin' forty. In the (more recent) ""SUPERMAN RETURNS"" movie, she's the old lady that dies leaving Lex Luthor a
fortune.

TOMMY BOND plays Jimmy Olsen in both of these serials... I think he's still alive. He wrote a book:

I guess I just settled THAT one. Well, anyway the actor that played ""Butch"", Alfalfa's foil in OUR GANG is Jimmy Olsen in these thirty episodes.

LYLE TALBOT plays Lex Luthor. If he sorta looks familiar it's only because he spent most of MY childhood playing neighbor roles for Ozzie & Harriet
Nelson... and a few other families as well.

while the other is a bit older, than me. I think you'll enjoy the first time a HUMAN BEING played Clark Kent instead of a cartoon... or just
Bud Colier's radio voice... perhaps an hommage... when Clark turns into Superman and FLIES he does it via cartoon-annimation, like Dracula
turning into a bat... in ""BUD ABBOTT AND LOU COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN""[coincedentally 1948, too]. Maybe WALTER ""Woody Woodpecker""
LANCE did these scenes as well as those Lugosi transformations?",1332633600,3,3111,7.244031830238727
2653635,4,B000I8OM94,As a superman fan it was nice to add these to my collection.  I wasn't certain I would enjoy these series but I did.  I think any true superman fan would as well.,1324512000,,162,3.878787878787879
2653636,1,B000I8OM94,"I grew up with ""Superman"" serials on Saturdays at our local theater.  It was great to watch Kirk Alyn change into a cartoon and fly through the air to rescue Lois Lane or stop some bad guys from some sinister deeds. I guess back in those days they did not have the special affects that we have now. I still wish I had gotten his autograph for my collection.",1318636800,,357,4.173913043478261
2653637,5,B000I8OM94,This is the best by far of all the serials.  Superman has been my fav... all my life and This is the best when you compare to TV and the early movie house serials. more like this from Amazon is what we all need,1314921600,,210,3.772727272727273
2653638,5,B000I8OM94,"I grew up watching George Reeves play Superman on television. I've been reading the comics since the '50s. I loved the first big-budget movie with Chris Reeve. I liked the pilot and first season of Lois & Clark. I have a love-hate relationship with Smallville. I like the original Fleischer Brothers cartoons.

All that said, I had never seen the original live-action serials with Kirk Alyn until I took a chance and ordered this from Amazon.com. I'm thrilled! It's tacky, to be sure, cheesy, and everything else you'd expect from a '40s serial, but it's also a whole lot of fun! No romance, no ""is he or isn't he"", just plain silly fun.

Kirk Alyn is just about perfect as Clark Kent, and quite heroic as Superman. This Clark is neither blandly strong, as George Reeves was, nor is he delightfully goofy like Chris Reeve. He is, however, nicely innocent, taking Lois's underhanded scheming with a graceful smile and never trying to get back at her. There is one thing that put me off just a little, though. Every now and then Clark gets beaten up by a couple of bad guys. I expect him to allow this to happen, of course, because he doesn't want them finding out that he's Superman, but after he's ""knocked out"" and left alone he'll shake his head, movie-style, and it looks like he really is recovering. It's not a big thing, but it just struck me as odd. But it was all more than sixty years ago, so I can't complain about it too much.

Noel Neill is wonderfully snarky as Lois Lane. Actually I hate her Lois, but that's not miss Neill's fault. Lois Lane in this version constantly ignores what everyone tells her and does things that almost get her killed (and should at least get her fired), and then blithely ignores whatever lessons she should have learned and goes right back and does it again. Sometimes I want to reach through the screen and smack her. And this was made two years before I was born! That's how engaging it is.

Tommy Bond is a bit odd as Jimmy Olsen, constantly trying to play the tough guy and constantly being knocked out. I'm surprised he didn't develop a brain tumor.

Overall I love these serials, and though they don't come close to modern special-effects believability they are fun, and that's what counts. Kirk Alyn is my favorite Superman!",1313366400,3,2274,4.563725490196078
2653639,4,B000I8OM94,"Sam Katzman produced these two ""Superman"" Theatrical Serials (1948 and 1950) on shoe-string budgets. What they lack in production value, they make up for in sheer fun. I love how each episode ends in a cliff-hanger; with the announcer saying something like, ""Don't miss the next thrill-packed episode of Superman at this theatre next week!!""
  Kirk Alyn was the screen's first live-action incarnation of Superman, but he never received screen credit for it. Katzman evidently thought it would be fun to let children believe he had cast ""the real Superman"" in the serials. Alyn was also the only screen Superman who never got to fly. Early flying tests  revealed that the ""wires"" were visable on camera. So, when Alyn leapt into the air, an animated ""flying Superman"" briefly took his place. The second serial ""Atom Man VS. Superman"" does feature a few inserted shots of Alyn flying, and then cuts back to the animated Superman. It is a shame Alyn never received proper credit. He plays Clark Kent with ""gee-whiz"" earnestness, and Superman with appropriate spirit and vigor. As portrayed by Noel Neill, Lois Lane is hardly a shrinking violet or helpless damsel in distress. Lois even goes so far as to have Clark arrested for ""stealing her car"" so she can scoop a hot news story. Tommy Bond (bully Butch in the ""Our Gang"" comedies) completes the main cast as young ""Daily Planet"" cub reporter Jimmy Olsen.
  In the first Serial, Superman races to stop notorious Queen of The Underworld Spider-Lady (Carol Forman), who seeks to gain control of the deadly Reducer Ray. In the second serial, Superman's arch-nemesis Lex Luthor (a perfectly cast Lyle Talbot) almost convinces Metropolis that he is a reformed, good citizen. Lex is, of course, still full of wicked ways. Superman is temporarily trapped in the far regions of outer space (called ""The Evil Doom"").
Superman also stops a flood and an earthquake, and saves Lois when she is kidnapped by Lex Luthor on his rocket ship.
  These Serials should not be dismissed, as they are a fun, vital part of the ""Superman"" pop-culture legacy. True ""Superman"" fans will certainly find these serial adventures delightful.",1308528000,,2160,4.966759002770083

.These serials were done by Sam (the cheap)Katzman. His penny pitching in hollywood is legendary. It shows here. That does not mean that these 2 serials are not worth looking into.
The are alot of fun. They are true to the comics of the time. What I mean is the innocents of the characters and the way the heavies always capture but never kill or harm the good guys.
The setup is very much like the future tv show called the Adventures of Superman

The serials star Kirk Allyn, Noel Neill. Tommy Bond and Pierre Watkins. Allyn is the man of steel. He is solid in the lead but not outstanding. Noel Neill is Lois Lane just like she is in the tv show. Tommy Bond is a good juvenile actor and is proper for Jimmy Olsen. Pierre Watkins is a tough Perry White who can hold his own in a fight.
The effects are poorly animated and do hurt the production. The actors are all earnest in thier roles which helps keep the serial moving and entertaining.
This is a fun time and worth owning at these prices. If you love superheroes this is must collecting just to see the first live action presentation of the Man of Steel.",1307664000,,1287,4.340248962655601
2653641,4,B000I8OM94,"I am a huge superman fan, and will start off by saying that this is not for everyone.  Just because a child likes current superman, does not mean that this is going to please all modern audiences.  I grew up watching AMC, and many of the old serials as a child, and I always loved Superman in every incarnation that I saw him him, though until purchasing this DVD set, had never come accross this particular version.  I have been collecting the different collections and comparing them, and while certain aspects of superman are the same like his ideal of society focusing on its leader and having super morality, and the ability to enforce what is right, and I have always felt that the more interesting aspects of superman over the years ahve been what society has viewed as good, and also the situations that Superman finds himself in that makes him decide that question of what is more important, and putting that kind of responsiblity on his shoulders and trying to ballance that with a personal life.  That personal life has usually been Lois Lane and Jimmy Olson, though others have been added in other series, they really aren't so much here.  There is a basic set up of the myth here, and clark coming to metropolis, and i really didn't expect that for some reason in my head, because the serials of the time being known for their very low budgets and because it doesn't seem necisary, being that we all know the Superman story, when it hits me that this is the very first telling outside of comic books.  I can tell you that this doesn't try to speak much above the children the comics were being read by, but its not without its charms.  The biggest stand out of this series is Noell as Lois Lane, who remains fiesty, yet femanine, and though many would not speak highly of her taking over on the television show, she is definately a positive step as a female role model.  There are lots of cheap tricks to will Superman make it, even Jimmi on a conveyer belt to a wood chipper, and the overall story arc for both is lacking a bit, its still enjoyable for cheap thrills, and a new take, even if its not up to modern standards, I have seen worse.  I have heard some complaints about the animated superman emposed during flight sequences, and even the costume looking like it was made from a cloth bag, but I don't really complain.  One thing that I will praise about the old timey films is that there seems to be a lot greater awareness for the placement of characters and their placement, and I am aware that this has a lot to do with teh editing code that you had to place people by showing them get into a car, out of a car, enter a building or else it might confuse people, while a couple of generations later it was just assumed that people would figure the character drove, it did require the writers to keep these things in mind, and I am not sure if our modern way is an improvement.  It has its good parts, but not the first place I would look for essential Superman collectors.",1306800000,,2997,4.401446654611211
2653642,5,B000I8OM94,"I've never watched the serials, but remember watching the Reeves shows when I was a kid. For this price I couldn't resist; and I'm glad I bought it.

My first two discs shipped loose in the case and disc 1 was damaged; good thing for Amazon's return policy. I'll just reorder it.

I'm still watching the first disc after the damaged area, but the quality is crisp and relatively clean for a film of it's age. I'd say it's as clear (or clearer) than my copy of Young Frankenstein. Yes, Superman's flying sequences are animated but rope-and-crane setups would have been too difficult, clumsy, and dangerous. Besides, people in those days had more imagination than we might have with CGI making viewer imagination unnecessary..

The sound is great and clear.  The stories are fun and better acted (for the era) and look great on my upscaling Blu-Ray player. The only part of the stories that kind of bother me (although I know it's just a setup tool for furthering the 'plot') is how Lois Lane is smart for many things but is always stupid at the wrong time; like untying a bad guy before asking who he is and trying to call police from practically in the same room as the bad guys. That's part of the camp of these old serials.

If you like old-time movies & TV, you'll love this set.",1303430400,,1282,4.484978540772532
2653643,5,B000I8OM94,"Hi, both these serials are great and are simiiar in style to the 1950's "" Adventures of Superman "" tv series; in fact I think these two movies were the prototype ( for the tv series ) and the tv series was simply an extension of these serials in terms of style. I would rate the first serial "" Superman "" 1948 ( vs the "" Spider Lady "" )as the better of the two; it's sort of the "" A "" side of a "" single "". This is mainly due to two main factors. The beautiful Noel Neill's performance and physical appearance, which is unique here in that she has lovely LONG hair and she wears a lovely long business skirt suit ( her long skirt even has short side splits / slits ) compared to the 2nd 1950 movie where she has a shorter haircut as per her appearance in the 1950's tv series ( from Season 2 onwards ); and her clothes aren't quite as nice. The other main factor is that in the 1948 movie we have a beautiful deadly villainess !!! The "" Spider Lady "" played by the beautiful long haired Carol Forman, who wears a wonderful long shiny black slinky dress. It's not that the "" Atom Man "" in the 1950 movie is bad ( he has a great looking mask )but after seeing Carol / the "" Spider Lsdy ""; it's hard not to miss her. I also was amazed and pleasantly surprised by the "" Superman "" of these serials; Kirk Alyn. He must be the most underated actor that ever played the character. In my opinion he is the best actor so far and superior to George Reeves portrayal. Why I think this is that he is quite obviously younger looking ( early mid 20's ), very athletic and he smiles / comes across / projects himself in a certain way ( it's hard to describe ) that would appeal to kids and also teenage girls 13 - 18 who would have had a "" crush "" on him. He's sort of a blend / combination of a "" young "" Superman and an "" old "" one. Anyway I highly recommended this two serial set; it's good value for money, the DVD is good quality ( I would have liked more extra features / shots of the actors but this is minor )and pretty much if you liked the 1950's tv series you'll like this too. All the best.",1302566400,2,2087,3.947867298578199

2653646,4,B000I8OM94,"By the beginning of the 1940s, television was coming into existence, and the idea of theatrical serials would be trumped by the episodic format that would come to TV in the 50s. But towards the end of its era, two serials were released in 1948 and 1950 that proved to be the most successful of the genre: ""Superman"" and its sequel, ""Atom Man vs. Superman,"" both of which are included on this four-disc set.
""Superman"" tells the origin story of the Man of Steel, from his arrival on earth and his growing up with the Kent family, to his arrival in Metropolis, where he assumes the role of mild-mannered Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent. From there, it tells the story of Superman's fight against the sinister Spider Lady (Played by the sexy and sinister Carol Forman). ""Superman"" is the best of the two theatrical serials. Despite some tendencies to drag, the serial is fun and exciting. Kirk Alyn's portrayal of the Man of Steel is good, though his Clark Kent is better. Noel Neill makes for a great Lois Lane, a role she would return to play not only in the next serial, but would resume as part of the ""Adventures of Superman"" cast in Season Two. The rest of the cast does a commendable job, and the story only occasionally goes into bouts of illogical elements.
The same cannot be said, however, for the follow-up story, ""Atom Man vs. Superman."" Here, the Man of Steel takes on the sinister Atom Man, who is none other than Superman's arch-nemesis, Luthor (Portrayed near-perfectly by Lyle Talbot, who recently worked for the same producers as Commissioner Gordon in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-and-Robin-The-Complete-1949-Movie-Serial-Collection/dp/B0007G89FU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman and Robin - The Complete 1949 Movie Serial Collection</a>), who threatens to destroy Metropolis with nuclear power and earthquakes. This serial, although good, suffers from a lot of padding, including an unnecessary plot where Superman is forced by Luthor into the Empty Doom (Possibly the early version of the Phantom Zone). Also, this one relies too much on Luthor's gadgetry (A similar problem with the ""Batman and Robin"" serial). Still, it has it's fun moments, and isn't completely idiotic in its storytelling.
The DVD presents both serials with fine picture and sound. The extras include a short-but-informative look at the history of the two serials, and a six-minute excerpt from the documentary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Look-Up-in-the-Sky-The-Amazing-Story-of-Superman/dp/B000FO0AHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Look, Up in the Sky!: The Amazing Story of Superman</a>.

2653651,5,B000I8OM94,"I'll start with a quick rehash of what was said in a lot of the other reviews. The first serial is fun, but the second is fantastic. Noel Neill is my all time favorite Lois Lane, based mostly on her performances here. Lyle Talbot's Luther is a brilliant and worthy enemy for the Man of Steel. Kirk Alyn is perfectly believable as both Clark and Superman.

One place I would like to take exception to the other reviewers is in the use of animation for the flying sequences. I don't think it's jarring at all -- I think its great.

In the 1950s TV series, the flying sequences were horrible -- Supes jumps out the window, cut to shot of George Reeves with his arms sticking out, cut to landing sequence where he jumps on to the set from out of camera range. Boring and hokey.

By using animation, when Superman is flying, he MOVES -- he swoops and dives at top speed. When he takes off, it's like a rocket. Given the budget and the state of special effects at the time, I think the animation was a great choice, one I wish they'd carried over into the TV series.

I thought these serials were great fun, and well worth the price. Nostalgia aside, these were far better and more fun than all but the first season of the TV series (and even that suffered for replacing Noel Neill with Phyllis Coates).",1269388800,2,1297,4.325102880658436
2653652,5,B000I8OM94,"I love these type of DVD's! What I like most about them is how they would do an effect back then as opposed to using CGI now....
I can see where the TV show (with George Reeves stared) got most of it's ideas. The only thing I had trouble with is when Superman flew it will go into a cartoon. It was still a great effect back then but it look so much better in the 1050 release when they started using wires.
The story was fun and it was nice to see Noel Neill in the latter one, I can see why she came back to the series. As with all the Cliffhanger series this one is just fun to watch for any age (but wait till your young ones ask why they are in black and white...).",1268179200,2,670,3.827338129496403
2653653,4,B000I8OM94,"I'm a WW2 Superman buff. In 1938 Superman first appeared in comics. In 1940, The Adventures of Superman premiered on radio. The show was on for eleven years, ten of those years starring Bud Collyer as Superman. For the entire eleven year run, with one or two possible episode exceptions, Joan Alexander played Lois Lane.  Kirk Alyn and Noel Neill are the first people to play Superman and Lois Lane live. At the beginning of the two serials, in the credits, the producers acknowledged that the serials are based of the radio show. In the Special Features of the discs, there is a history of the Superman serial that makes no reference to the old radio show. The historians acted as if there was just the comic and ten years later, in 1948, the first serial. One of the few parts of that documentary that was accurate, relevant and in context was Noel Neill's description of how she got the role. These serials were named after two of the most popular 1945 stories from the radio show; which ARE in public domain. Neither serial follows the original story, but both serials are fun. The 1950 serial shows an improvement in the special effects and one can see a glimpse of the effects of the Superman t.v. Series of the 50s. The only complaint about the serials I had was that I felt that Tommy Bond was too old to play Jimmy Olsen, but he did a good job anyway.

What is left to mention about ""Superman - The 1948 & 1950 Theatrical Serials Collection"" is WHERE the source material came from....When these two serials were first reissued (separately) on VHS in the late 1980s, in conjunction with Superman's 50th anniversary, one piece of information got lost amongst the ballyhoo...almost: Kirk Alyn provided Warner HIS OWN PERSONAL COPIES of the serials for them to use. This might explain (in part) why ""Atom Man Vs. Superman"" does not look as sharp as ""Superman"", and it makes one wonder if Columbia's film vault was ever gone over for prints of the serials. If they had been, and nothing was found, then...thank goodness for Mr. Alyn's copies (God rest his soul)! It would be a shame if these enjoyably cheesy chapterplays were lost to history!

Now onto the nitty gritty. In this collection you get BOTH of the Superman serials in completed form, and in a very nice casing as well. Getting both in one package really is a nice way to go, considering that the Batman serials are sold as two seperate DVDs with pretty much no special features. Thankfully they didn't skip out on Superman and there is a documentary about the creation of the two serials.

In ""Superman"" we see the first live action incarnation of Superman's origin and there's plenty of peril as the untrusting Lois Lane tries to beat Clark Kent to the goal of bringing down the nefarious Spider Lady, the queen of crime! Take note though that all flying and jumping sequences are animated, and though George Reeves made Superman take flight it wasn't until Christopher Reeve came along that they could really perfect Superman's ability to fly...making you truly believe that a man can fly! Also this serial marks the first live action appearance of Kryptonite, which had been created for the 1940s Superman radio show!

In ""Superman VS Atom Man"" we get to see Lex Luthor on screen for the very first time, in his original mad scientist form, though he is only called ""Luthor"" during this time. Both serials are a treasure og Golden Age thrills, chills, action, and serial cliffhangers that'll make you eager to see what's next!

Directed by Spencer Gordon Bennet(known for his Batman serial) & Thomas Carr; the serials star Kirk Alyn, Noel Neill, Carol Foreman, Tommy Bond, Forrest Taylor, & Lyle Talbot(also a Batman serial alumni). This is the first 'live' appearance of Superman in the movies but don't expect too much out of the serials(although they are great) as they were made on shoe-string budgets back in the day. True, Superman has come along way since then but cut him some slack while watching these serials. All in all, this is a great purchase sure to satiate Superman fans waiting patiently for their next Superdude fix(lol).

If I had any gripes, it'd be that they could have included some special features of some sort. Commentary from DC Alumni on the serial or something like that.",1218412800,,1117,4.878947368421053

That being said, I had a good time with the Superman serials. Kirk Alyn is OK as Clark Kent/Superman. The strange part about Clark Kent is that sometimes it appears he loses his powers when he's Clark. He can be beaten and knocked out. Other times he has his powers. Noel Neil is Lois Lane, the reporter who always finds herself in a predicament and must be rescued by Superman. I doubt a real reporter would purposely put him/herself in such situations. Poor Tommy Bond. As Jimmy Olsen, his only purpose is to get beaten up easily several times.

The special effects, well they don't exist! When Superman flies he becomes a cartoon.

But I still got a kick out of it. Two serials are included; ""Superman"" and battles the Spider Lady, and ""Atom Man vs. Superman"". Atom Man is the best of the two. This one introduces Luthor. I believe The actor playing Luthor is the same actor who portrayed Batman in the Batman & Robin serials.

Before the TV show, Superman was brought to life in the Saturday Morning Serial. Here on 4 DVDS in the 1948 & 1950 serial (Superman & Atom men vs Superman).

The serials were 12-15 15 episodes which ran weekly with a movie. These short mini movies always left  a character or Charater in a cliffhanger situation of life or death, which always they escaped in the next episode.

These two serials are a throwback to an easier time. with over the top villians like the Spider-Lady.

I remember was a was a kid at the Melba theater in Bronx, New York. They ran kiddy days, with a Disney or Disney like movie (Zebra in the Kitchen, A Tiger Walks, Circus World), with cartoons and serial episodes. AS I watch these episodes I was seven again and had the same thriill I had then

2653677,5,B000I8OM94,"Another amazing super-hero serial, that will delight senior citizens like myself ( 60's ). Live through the Saturday matinee again and again.

2653678,4,B000I8OM94,"Well, I was enjoying all 8-plus hours of this set until I got to the short except of an upcoming documentary on the Man of Steel.  The documentary, like this disk, was meant to coincide with and complement the release of 2006's `Superman Returns.'  All's cool until one of the talking heads - I refuse to watch it again so I'll never know which head - says there ""are good Superman movies and bad Superman movies.""  Clips are played under his voice, and when he says ""good Superman movies"" we see a clip of a Chris Reeve Superman (appropriately enough) and when he says ""bad Superman movies"" we see a clip from the 1948 `Superman serial' that we've just finished watching on disks one and two of this set.  Boo!  Hiss!  And what's up with that!?

 Poor Kirk Alyn (Clark Kent/Superman) can't get any respect.  First, he's unbilled in both the 1948 and 1950 serial (`We couldn't find an actor good enough to play Superman, so Superman's playing himself!' is how that lack-of-credit decision was made.)  Then along comes this snotty little documentary clip to sweep his stuff into the dustbin.  Yeah, these serial episodes are corny, made on the cheap, and geared towards a late 1940s 12-year-old's sensibilities, but neither were nearly as bad as that Reeve Superman with Richard Pryor was.

 Besides, these are serials which, according to reliable sources, were among the most successful serials ever made.  Serials are short (15-17 minutes in length) films that were a part of the Saturday matinee tradition from the silent era to the mid-1950s.  There were usually about 15 episodes per serial, one played each week - the thought being that the kiddies would return week after week to follow the adventures of their heroes.  To turn the heat up a bit, each episode usually ends with a cliff-hanger - Lois Lane is lying unconscious in a cave when the 10-gallon drum of dynamite explodes five feet away from her.  The episode ends with a teaser - can Superman stop the evil Spider Lady from getting her hands on the all-powerful reducer ray? - as well as the possibility that Lois Lane was just blown to smithereens.  Don't miss the next episode of `Superman' - playing at this theater next week.

 In the first, 1948 serial, simply titled `Superman,' the Man of Steel battles the Spider Lady and her nefarious henchmen.  In the second serial, `Superman vs. Atom Man,' he confronts his arch-nemesis, Lex Luthor (who also plays Atom Man, for reasons too complicated to get into here.)  The opening credits in each episode tells us Superman is based on the character credited in the comic books, and is adapted from the popular Superman radio program.  Bud Collyer played Superman for a decade on the radio, and his show contributed mightily to the formation of the most popular comic book character of all time.  It's easy to forget how much the radio program drove and helped to shape the Superman world.  Betcha didn't know Perry White and Jimmy Olson both debuted on the radio.  The 1948 serial has a couple of elements lifted directed from the radio program, elements they would wisely drop when they came around to filming the 1950 sequel.  When Superman's fighting the Spider Lady, every time danger's a-brewing and Clark Kent has to do the quick change into tights and cape Alyn voice-overs a Collyer-ish ""This looks like a job for Superman,"" dropping from a nebbish tenor to a super hero baritone when he got to the words ""for Superman.  Also, Alyn belts a hearty ""up, up, and away!"" every time he goes airborne - a nice vocal cue for a radio program, but a little much for a film.  Oh, and in both serials the flying Superman is depicted through regular, old-fashioned cel animation. Not convincing, but really not all that much worse than some current CG animation.  They'd hang Alyn from ceiling mounted wires and blow smoke past him in the sequel, while retaining the cel animation for the long shots and when they needed to show anime bullets bouncing off his chest.

 By today's standards the special effects are almost laughably primitive - but this is the first appearance EVER of a live action Superman!  How cool is that!?

 Pretty darn cool, mister, and don't you forget it!  If you can get into the rhythms of a serial this set shouldn't disappoint.  Kirk Alyn was a professional dancer, veteran of other serials, and his graceful athleticism makes him a more than acceptable Man of Steel.  Noell Neill is delightfully spunky as girl reporter Lois Lane.  A brief digression - these serials were made for youngsters and there is no, repeat no, romance between Lois and Clark Kent or Superman.  Even when Superman is about to rescue her (yet again!) and asks ""Are you ready?"" and Lois answers ""I'm always ready!"" Neill's reading is so gleefully innocent it takes a moment or two to figure out they might have been talking about Something Else.  My favorite character of all is Lyle Talbot's Lex Luthor.  He doesn't get the big buck dialogue given guys like Gene Hackman, or Kevin Spacey, but his sober, straightforward take on the character works well.

As kid safe and family friendly as these disks are I hesitate to recommend them for family night around the dvd.  The coolest thing, a live action Superman on film, lost its novel appeal decades ago.  These films have an innocent charm and are as corny as Iowa in August, but they probably won't appeal to many children between the ages of 6 and 20.",1175472000,72,5419,4.718085106382978

I love the spider lady she was better than Luthor/Atom man I think. Lois was awesome. The one thing I can say about this Lois is that she was actually cuter than any other Lois and was convincing. The only problem I had w/it was Kirk Alyn he was not convicing to me to be Clark or Superman and not good. It's no wonder I never heard of him or my parents remembering him. Great all in all though.

I mean, let's face it. It was the late 40's and considering what was at their disposal at the time, I think they pulled it off rather well.

Plus there's a certain rawness to the characters that is a little more refreshing than the 50's TV series. I think Noel Neill's -Lois Lane- is actually cuter in this presentation.

But as with the TV series, I still don't understand why they used LA as a cityscape image for some of the supposedly Metropolis imagery. For the life of me, LA is a suburban city not an urban city (and this fact was even more obvious in the 40's and 50's)...  why they didn't use pictures of NYC is beyond me. And for me personally, this kind of weakens some of the scenes.

2653697,5,B000I8OM94,"These serials are terrific--if you like serials.  I first watched these serials at the Shaw Theatre in St. Louis when I was a kid and was a Superman fan for life.  For almost 40 years they were hidden away because of some contractual language forbidding them to be shown on TV or other future venues.  It was cleared up some years ago and these were released on VHS--but the DVD versions are much better.  Great clarity and presentation.  The stories are typical serial stories from the late 40's and early 50's, but they are fun to watch.  The only regret is that they didn't follow the lead of Republic Studios who filmed very effective flying sequences in the ""The Adventures of Captain Marvel"", another serial filmed several years earlier.  Instead cheapskate Columbia opted for cartoon flying sequences in these two serials.  This is the only complaint one can have about these two serials.

Childhood memories are sometimes are clouded by time and revealed as such many years later, but in the case of these two serials, they brought back great memories of Saturday afternoons at the ""show"".  Superman was terrific then and is still terrific now.  I do remember that when the Superman TV program came on a couple of years after seeing the first ""Superman"" serial, I always thought George Reeves was the wrong choice to play Superman because he didn't look like Superman from the comics, he didn't look like Kirk Alyn (who did look like Superman in the Comics), and he didn't have a curl.  The first year on TV had Phyllis Coates playing Lois Lane (a good actress but not the Lois Lane of the serials), but they got it right bringing in Noel Neill for the remaining years of the TV show.

If you like serials, or are not familiar with serials, then ""Superman"" and ""Superman Vs Atom Man"" are great fare and a great introduction to the world of Saturday afternoon matinees.

2653704,5,B000I8OM94,"I was lucky enough to meet Kirk Alyn several years ago in southern California and he was a gracious, out-going, friendly person.  This was the same persona he brought to the original Superman.

The shows, while dated by our standards, are a lot of fun to watch.  The effects (for instance the animated flight sequences) are hokey and many of the plot devices, while typical for Saturday matinee serials, seem a bit silly now.  Still, the cast had enthusiasm and seemed to really be having fun. (BTW, while these came out at the end of the run of the Saturday afternoon movie serials, they actually were the most profitable of all the serials.)

Kirk Alyn was a great casting choice (even though the producers decided not to give him credit in either serial).  Noel Nielle is still the type model for Lois Lane for me and seemed to be almost born to be Lois.  Tommy Bond (of Lil Rascals fame) actually helped create the Jimmy Olsen character in these serials.  Pierre Watkin as the irascable Perry White undoubtedly influenced the future Perry portrayers.

Carol Forman as the Spider Lady and Lyle Talbot as the first film version of Lex Luthor were well-cast and added their talents well as the sinister villians Superman had to overcome.

These are a nice addition to my Superman collection and fun to watch.  Especially Kirk Alyn who seemed to really enjoy himself as well as personify, for a pre-TV generation, Superman.",1168300800,3,1423,4.7439024390243905

Well, okay, the original series would be the one on radio, or even Siegel & Schuster's first comics, but this is the one that first put Supes on film.  Kirk Alyn does not get screen credit, but does a wonderful job.  Just once did I wonder how a man could pull off a dual identity, when Clark runs after a crook, and Kirk runs as Clark just like he does as Superman.  They didn't use the motto, ""you will believe a man can fly"" and it's just as well...the flying is animated, but a vital part of the story.  For Superman fans, this is a must -- how to depict x-ray vision without special effects? the original appearance of Lex Luthor (in ""Atom Man"") etc. I'm just surprised there weren't more, and earlier.  By the time ""Atom Man"" came out, there was TV and George Reeves was just around the corner.  It's kind of fun to compare the two, but not really fair to put either next to Reeve or Cain, who had the advantage of special effects.

2653707,5,B000I8OM94,"I held off on buying this set because of the negative reviews. But when I received it as a Christmas gift from my brother, which he ordered through AMAZON, I couldn't wait to see if the three previous reviews had any credibility. AND, THEY DO NOT! The discs have a very good (not perfect) but very good picture quality. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being best. SUPERMAN (1948) averages a 9. ATOM MAN vs SUPERMAN (1950) averages an 8. The picture quality is not always consistant. But it never fell into the category of unwatchable or disappointing. Nor did I experience any freezing, major artifacts or pixelation break-ups, just occasional film scratches and slight graininess from time to time. The sound was clear, powerful, and, dynamic. There was absolutely no sound glitch in any of the four discs, especially Jor-El's speech to the council. My only gripe is, just like the last two boxed sets of the George Reeves series, this also lacks English subtitles. A big kick I get is spotting as many actors as I can that have also appeared in the BATMAN (1943) and BATMAN and ROBIN (1949) serials. More so for Batman and Robin. Both of which are also available on DVD. AND THE PICTURE LOOKS FINE FOR THEM TOO. There's a similar music track for both BATMAN and ROBIN (1949) and ATOM MAN vs SUPERMAN (1950). Some of Superman's flight sequences look like he's (swimming) rather than flying, through the air as you see his legs doing a swimmers' kick. That aside, these serials are packed with suspense, excitement, and fun.

8144329,5,B000I8OM94,"Of course, I was most impressed with the Superman costume which I consider superior to the tv George Reeves Superman affair.  The serial, which I saw in the theatre in 1948 and 1950 had dynamite nostalgia value.  Additionally, was delighted how much Kirk Alyn, replete with 'spit curl' looked the spit & image of Superman.  Also, Alyn looked as much like Blackhawk, a comic character he also brought to life in another Columbia serial.  My disappointment would be the same as most who've seen it was that flying scenes were animated.  But understand the limitations of pre-computer days.  Atom Man vs. Superman is superb.

8144334,5,B000I8OM94,"if something lasts long enough, it has to adjust itself to a number of approaches, sometimes even in a media that comes and goes long before the property itself does. the process, if not necessarily the art, of superhero cinema, of which we'd had a veritable renaissance in recent years, began in a form that would no doubt leave it's current generation of devotees scratching their heads.
in the early days of ""talkie"" cinema there came about what was called the matinee serial. movies at the time often came with a selection of appetizers (newsreels, cartoons, etc.), and the serials were a similar side dish. they operated on the same principle as a season of a tv series, with an episode (or ""chapter,"" as they were called) playing at the local movie theater every Saturday. over an average of 12 or 15 weeks, 15 to 20 minute installments of a grand adventure would play out, often making it's most visceral impression with it's weekly cliffhangers. (the Batman series of the '60s greatly satirized the serials of old, and fittingly, it's own cliffhangers are one of the things it's own fans remember best.) this was essentially the beginning not simply of superhero movies as we know them today, but of action/adventure cinema itself.
while not limited to superheroes by any means - Star Wars and Indiana Jones are both famously patterned after this style of film - somewhere down the line it became more or less synonymous with caped crusaders. so naturally Superman - often cited as the original superhero (although it's debatable that The Shadow beat him to the punch) - would seem a natural. so it's interesting to note that his long-delayed arrival on the matinee screen arrived just as the art-form itself began to dwindle in the wake of television's coming revolution.
at the risk of repeating myself, any production is made or broken by it's cast. the most familiar player herein will be Noel Neill, since she would shortly reprise the role on television opposite George Reeves. she remains in many ways the most inherently likable Lois Lane. she has that familiar but indefinable quality through which she can get away with murder (or in this case, derailing Clark Kent so she'll get to the story before he does) on sheer charm. on tv she replaced for one Phyllis Coates, who was mostly exemplary in the part, but had too hard an edge to swindle Clark without coming off as something of a bitch.
cub reporter Jimmy Olsen is played by one Tommy Bond, best known for having played the bully Butch in the Our Gang/Little Rascals comedies a decade before. it's often stated that Jack Larson, the Jimmy of the aforementioned tv series, was the one who more than anyone cemented the importance of Jimmy's role in Superman's world, the one who made the character a phenomenon in his own right. maybe so, but Bond laid much of the groundwork. he played effectively the same sort of earnest ""golly"" youngster and is, much like Larson's incarnation, primarily here as someone Lois Lane can talk to. he's a similar sort of comic relief, although he doesn't bumble or panic the way Larson would.
Perry White is played passably by one Pierre Watkin. he's not a volatile figurehead like John Hamilton or a force of nature like Jackie Cooper, but he's grouchy enough to pull it off. interestingly, i've heard somewhere that when John Hamilton died in 1958, Watkin was signed on to fill the void, much as Neill had done a few years before. there's no telling how it would've worked, though, since George Reeves shuffled off his own mortal coil in the interim.
as for the man himself, he's played by...Superman. honest. would the credits lie?
seriously though, that was part of the publicity campaign. the actor in that place was one Kirk Alyn, a long-running star of the matinee serials. as it happens, he not only looks the part, but has an ideal approach to the job. most vitally, he recognized that it was a double role and established a boundary. most obviously he took a cue from the radio series, on which actor Bud Collyer gave Clark a softer tenor voice and Superman a booming baritone.
i've often felt that George Reeves fell just shy of perfection because he neglected this angle. it's believable that Christopher Reeve could successfully hide Superman because he didn't just wear those oft-kidded glasses. his Clark had different body language, a different voice, was even said to to be a few inches shorter. otherwise exemplary though he was, George Reeves and George Reeves alone was shortsighted enough to play Superman and Clark Kent pretty much the same way.
the Man Of Steel finally made his belated live-action debut in 1948's Superman. it created a minor controversy, ironically with one of the key reasons it had taken so long. attempts to make the character believably soar through the air with contemporary techniques hadn't panned out, and they finally settled for converting the character into a cartoon when he flies. today this is widely recognized as a creative, brilliant, maybe even ingenious solution to the limits of the day's special effects, but there were those who felt gypped at the time.
a more tangible blemish would be an overused narrator. on top of setting up next week's chapter and/or recapping last week's, he proves invaluable in the first two episodes explaining how Kal-El came to Earth and how Clark came to The Metropolis Daily Planet. but for some reason he feels compelled to occasionally resurface and explain the laughably obvious with lines like ""again, Superman makes use of his X-ray vision!""
that aside, it hits the spot with a vengeance. both serials are fast paced without feeling rushed, fantastic but rooted in a believable reality, and keep the comprehensibility level in reach of the kiddies (it's target audience) without talking down to them. even the sequel's recap of the original's origin story (a common tactic with serial sequels) somehow fits in without feeling like the filler it probably was intended as.
one Carol Foreman made he most lasting mark by playing villainesses in serials, making her one of the pioneering ""bad girls"" in action/adventure, maybe even cinema itself. here she menaces our heroes as ""queen of the underworld,"" The Spider Lady. the character can't help being a bit hokey. (most obvious question: why not the more impressive as well as more befitting ""Spider Woman""? my guess is because it was remembered that earlier in the decade, one of Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes movies had pitted him against, indeed been titled, The Spider Woman.) she also employs curiously little spider-themed affectation, seemingly limited to an electrocution device resembling a spider's web. he usual outfit is a rather slinky nightclub-type dress. but still, Foreman effortlessly demonstrates the knack for sultry malevolence she's had plenty of time to fine-tune. so many sexy female ""heavies"" have overplayed their feminine wiles at the expense of any menace they might project, but Foreman knew her way around that pothole. she's unquestionably a menace.
the follow-up, 1950's Atom Man Vs. Superman, is one of those rare sequels that manages to outdo it's ancestor. it was loosely inspired by a popular serial from the radio series, but as per the less anal-retentive standards of the time, though, only the basics of the titular Atom Man character are used. rather than the nuclear themed ""supervillain"" of the air waves, this particular Atom Man is, let's just say, a red herring. but he's a red herring which highlights this serial's basic edge: it manages to employ more of the fantasy/science-fiction side of the character than it seemed like live-action could handle at the time. (the first serial and the George Reeves series tended to boil down to Superman Vs. Organized Crime.)
more to the point, though, what makes this serial a particular favorite and/or milestone is that it features the first ever film portrayal - in fact first ever use of the character anywhere but the comic book - of Lex Luthor. the character as originally conceived was a textbook mad scientist. a surprisingly first-rate production design enables the film to do his machinations justice, and one wonders why it took so long to again so effectively serve Superman's nemesis on-screen. (for this more than any other reason, Luthor, as well as other iconic comic foes like Bizarro or General Zod, would never be used or even mentioned on the George Reeves show.)
he's played by one Lyle Talbot, a consummate actor who had a long and fruitful career in productions of varying quality. but alas, he has to carry the stigma of his most readily memorable roles being in a few of Ed Wood's movies, including Plan 9 From Outer Space. oh, well.
the very concept of matinee serials and how they work won't quite translate to everyone, but those who understand it and appreciate it can't go wrong with Superman's contribution. not only is it an immensely satisfying specimen, but proved an exceptionally significant one, as it signified the end of an era. the television phenomenon was taking it's first steps at the time, and within a few years would phase the serial out completely. as such, Superman and Atom Man Vs. Superman would go down in history as the last ""great"" matinee serials, as well as the most financially successful ones of all time.
and i happen to think that, next to that Citizen Kane of the genre, Buster Crabbe's turn as Flash Gordon, it's the very finest.",1496707200,4,9435,4.8975
