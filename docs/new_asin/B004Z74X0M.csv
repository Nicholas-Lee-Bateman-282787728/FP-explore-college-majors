4505712,5,B004Z74X0M,Thank goodness there were more movies after the 12th season.  My mother is 94 and adores the antics of Mrs. Fletcher  She believes that Jessica is the biggest busy- body in the world.  Closed captioning is excellent since smom is extremely hard of hearing.  A must purchase for good clean entertainment,1330214400,20,302,4.862745098039215
4505713,5,B004Z74X0M,This is in my opinion a great series. My wife and I both enjoy each and every one of the episodes and I fuly intend to purches all or at least as many seasons as are on the market,1329436800,9,179,3.6153846153846154
4505714,5,B004Z74X0M,These 4 films that followed the beloved Murder She Wrote series staring the wonderful Angela Lansbury are just great and fun to watch. They are 1 1/2 hours long so there is more time than the TV show to develop the mystery and the scenery in each film is beautiful (the cinematography for these 4 films feels more like a big budget movie than a TV show). Angela Lansbury is her charming self and really carries these films. I have watched them over and over again. They are great for a Saturday night at home or on a rainy Sunday when you're just sitting around the house. They are family friendly and very enjoyable.,1329436800,92,617,4.421052631578948
4505715,5,B004Z74X0M,"I have been hoping for a release of the movies made after the end of the Murder She Wrote series.  This is a wonderful addition to my collection which includes all 12 seasons of the show and most of the books.  Angela Lansbury is stellar in her performance as Jessica Fletcher.  While my favorite episodes will always be those that occur in the tiny town of cabot cove, I realize only so much murder can occur in one place, hence, her later travels.  The rumors of her return to do a final appearance as the famous mystery writer slueth is exciting and I truly hope the studio can pull it together. I'd love to add yet another movie to my collection.  I highly recommend all 12 seasons, these 4 movies and any of the books.  I've seen them all many times and read each book.",1329264000,37,774,4.303448275862069
4505716,5,B004Z74X0M,"I DIDN'T SEE ANY OF THE ""MURDER, SHE WROTE"" MOVIES. AND BACK IN THE EIGHTIES WHEN THE SERIES FIRST STARTED I WAS TO BUSY: DATING, SCHOOL, ETC, TO WATCH MUCH OF IT. THOUGH I DID LIKE THE SERIES I WAS HOOKED ON OTHER SHOWS LIKE: ""DYNASTY"", ""DALLAS"", ""FALCON CREST"", ""KNOTS LANDING"", A FEW ASSORTED DAYTIME SOAP OPERAS AND SITUATION COMEDIES. I DIDN'T GET REALLY ATTACHED TO ""MURDER, SHE WROTE"" UNTIL THE ""1990'S"" BECAUSE MOST EVERYTHING ELSE DECENT HAD LEFT THE AIRWAVES. THEN WITH WORK, I STILL COULD NOT WATCH ""MURDER, SHE WROTE"" BECAUSE I WAS WORKING ON THE NIGHTS IT WAS COMING ON. I JUST COULDN'T WIN IN THE TELEVISION WATCHING DEPARTMENT. SO, I WAS ECSTATIC WHEN ""MURDER, SHE WROTE"" BECAME AVAILABLE ON DVD, THOUGH STILL TO THIS DAY I ONLY HAVE FIVE SEASONS: THE FIRST, SIXTH, SEVENTH, EIGHTH, AND THE TWELFTH. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUYING THIS SERIES INSTEAD OF ""PERRY MASON"". AT LEAST I WOULD HAVE BEEN GETTING AN ENTIRE SEASON FOR MY MONEY. I HAD HEARD SOMEWHERE ABOUT THE MOVIES, BUT AFTER DVD'S BECAME AVAILABLE I WAS NO LONGER INTERESTED IN THE ""VHS"" FORMAT. I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THE MOVIES SO I CAN'T GIVE AN HONEST OPINION BUT SINCE THEY ARE ""MURDER, SHE WROTE"" WITH THE ""JESSICA FLETCHER"" CHARACTER, THEY'RE PROBABLY FANTASTIC. I'M PRE-ORDERING MINE TODAY. THESE WILL MAKE A PERFECT MOTHER'S DAY GIFT FOR ""JESSICA FLETCHER"" FANS, THOUGH THAT ISN'T UNTIL IN MAY. LAST YEAR I BOUGHT THE ENTIRE ""GOLDEN GIRLS"" SERIES. THIS YEAR ""JESSICA FLETCHER"" HAS THE ATTENTION.",1327276800,14,1473,4.803149606299213

4505718,5,B004Z74X0M,"These four TV movies provided the last gasp for the defunct series.  Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) sleuths her way through the southwest, the distant history of the south, then off to Ireland, exposing murderers and almost getting killed in the bargain.  After this, she sleuthed no moremores the pity.",1521504000,,307,5.244897959183674

4505765,5,B004Z74X0M,Really great series used to watch when it was on TV with parent reminds me of how much we enjoyed figuring out who done it...well written and always fun to see guest stars from back in the 80's and 90's.,1480896000,,203,4.1
4505766,5,B004Z74X0M,"I thought I'd seen every one of the Murder She Wrote episodes either as the prime time show or during the syndication period.  Wrong-O!  There were episodes that helped to connect the entire series.  I thought most of the episodes took place in Cabot Cove, Maine.  Another Wrong-O!  They took place all over the world, free and not-so-free world countries.  We've gone through them twice, completely, and to pick up on some of the more difficult plots, more than that.  If you enjoyed the TV Series, and would like some good entertainment that doesn't involve sex and extreme violence, then this is for you.  I'd recommend it if it fits your interest.",1478995200,9,651,4.75

4505768,4,B004Z74X0M,"I would give it five stars except one of the four movies gets a little 'preaching to the choir'.  Nevertheless, the message of racial tolerance is perhaps even more badly needed now, so no harm done.  All four movies are just what Jessica's fans want, more Jessica in action: savvy, sophisticated, daring, and smart.  Great to have these available in one complete set.",1478476800,2,368,4.809523809523809

4505795,5,B004Z74X0M,As I was finishing up the last regular season of this show I knew I must have the movies also. I was pleased to find them listed separately and have enjoyed them. Angela Lansbury does a wonderful job as always. While her aging is noticeable - she was in her late 70s for the last movie - it does not detract anything from the action nor  from the memories of the original series. She is still spry and clever at solving those mysteries! May I look so good at her age!,1464048000,6,467,4.131868131868132

4505798,5,B004Z74X0M,"I have been looking for these TV films since I first saw them on TV between 1997 and 2003, It's so great to have them all together in one set that fits nicely with my complete series of Murder, She Wrote!

Now, on to the quality. The case is a standard DVD case with a stout plastic holding tray (which holds disc one), which makes this a higher quality case than some others out there (for instance, the Warner Bros. style of cardboard/plastic cases that tend to be rather flimsy, as well as cases that contain holding trays specifically for discs housed in sleeves, which is a rather sub standard method of housing discs, because they tend to scratch so easily in disc sleeves).

I haven't read anything that indicates that the films have been remastered, but regardless, the video and audio quality are really nice.

If you're a longtime fan of Murder, She Wrote and/or Angela Lansbury, or just like one-off mystery movies, this is the collection for you!",1461628800,,958,4.623529411764705

The Jessica Fletcher character is believable, smart, and charming; Angela Lansbury did a superb job in this role. I'm paying attention to the production sets, costumes, hair styles, and props, since it's interesting to see what was ""in"" during the years of the broadcast. This set has already been well worth the cost for me.",1461283200,2,509,4.862068965517241

What I particularly enjoy about these movies, they show Angela Lansbury at her talented best, with more expansive roles than in the series. Not as ""light"" viewing as some of the TV episodes were, given their shorter length.

Great price, great actress, great DVD set...what's not to love!",1440806400,,407,4.8
4505831,5,B004Z74X0M,"As always, Jessica Fletcher is top notch.  I loved watching ""Murder She Wrote"" when it was on television, and the mystery movies are great!  This particular collection includes a wide range of relatively well known actors, and the story lines are excellent.  I especially enjoyed ""A Story to Die For"" which included Richard Crenna, Daniel Dae Kim and Duncan Regehr, who plays Zorro in ""The New Zorro"".  I recognized the name, but it took quite a while to discover which role Duncan Regehr was playing, and although I liked him much better as ""Zorro"", he did a very good job playing a very nasty villain.",1440374400,,603,4.714285714285714

There's not a lot of phony action going on, no guns blazing, no magnificent fight scenes and she is by no means a size zero with a facelift going on.

4506050,4,B004Z74X0M,"At approximately 90 minutes each, this collection of four made-for-TV movies is not the best, nor the worst, of the long-running series.  Ms. Lansbury was approaching 80 when they were shot, and its noticable in the quickness of her motions, but she's still the competent clue-chasing sleuth she was in the Murder, She Wrote television series.  She certainly doesn't look as old as she is, and still maintains that inquisitive bounciness that engaged her viewers in the eighties and nineties.
  Only two of the movies have name guest-stars- Richard Crenna (of Sylvestor Stallone's Rambo series)  in A Story To Die For, and Phylicia Rashad (The Cosby Show) in The Last Free Man.  Ms. Rashad is so competent in her role you wish the movie was a little bit longer,  just to showcase her talents.
  Of the remaining two, The Celtic Riddle was shot in scenic Ireland, and South By Southwest  is about the Amtrak journey from Los Angeles to El Paso.  Most of the movies have rather large casts, and hence a lot of suspicious charactors.

4506054,4,B004Z74X0M,"Murder, She Wrote 4 Movie Collection, 2012 film

The ""Murder, She Wrote"" TV series was on broadcast TV from 1984 to 1996, a very long run for a series. It benefitted from its original time slot (8 pm Sunday) with stories designed for a wide audience appreciation (dramatic murder mysteries that were not frightening). I used to watch it the first couple of years (it followed an investigative news show), but then a change in the producer or stories led to a lower quality. ""Jessica Fletcher"" was a murder mystery writer who also assisted the local Sheriff of ""Cabot Cove"", a small New England rural town. This was different from the classic Private Investigators who dealt with a grittier environment (Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe, Mike Hammer, etc.).  Was the name ""fletcher"" chosen to recall ""archer""?

These movies were made after the series ended. I found them of varying quality. The cast always has a lot of extras, a cost avoided in many TV shows. The fans of Jessica may not care about the story as long as Jessica can demonstrate luck and serendipity in solving the murders that break out when she is in the vicinity. (Would you want her as a guest in your home?) One interesting thing about her character is the lack of a partner to comment on or question the events. But this may be needed for novels rather than movies. Jessica also seems to be more passive than a Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot (little involvement in background investigations). But this series' success is proof of its formula.

""South by Southwest"" is the best because of its heritage. The story echoes many famous movies. Parts reminded me of ""Foreign Correspondent"", ""North by Northwest"", ""The Lady Vanishes"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", ""The Thirty-Nine Steps"" (the train station ""Hannay""). The ending echoes ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"". Jessica's involvement in intrigue as she goes about her business was the start of many Eric Ambler's novels. It begins when Jessica meets a ""Stranger on a Train"". The valuable item sought is a memory chip to encrypt (or decrypt) data for US satellites. A lot happens before the chip is recovered. Note the product placement.

""A Story to Die For"" occurs when Jessica works as a Motivational Speaker (people pay money to hear famous people make a speech). One of the speakers is a former KGB official who wrote a book. Another is a double for a popular radio talk show host (with a substance abuse problem). There is another novelist ""Warren Pierce"". One of these is found shot dead, the solution requires finding the motive among people who never met before. Jessica does it.

""The Last Free Man"" takes place in 1860 Virginia. Men talk about the possibility of war. A newly married man is shot dead at night! Sarah (Jessica's ancestor) investigates. And so does Jessica in modern times. The murderer is discovered, but politics creates a cover-up. Jessica learns the secret about a man who seems to have been buried in two different graves! A man will revise history because of this new evidence. [Note how this skates over controversial subjects.]

""The Celtic Riddle"" was adapted from a novel and is set in Ireland. A man is seen on videotape, his will divided his property in an unusual way. Each heir is given a clue to find a valuable treasure. Only by working together will they be able to locate this hidden treasure. The story involves family secrets. The solution requires solving a riddle from these many clues. [Would this happen outside of a novel?] It is needlessly complex, and requires translating English to Gaelic (only a young woman can do this). The motive arose from family history known to only a few. Everyone wants more than what they have, a classic formula for murder. [Ever read ""The List of Adrian Messenger""?]",1338940800,6,3764,4.799382716049383

4506066,5,B004Z74X0M,"I absolutely adore Jessica Fletcher, English teacher turned mystery writer/ sleuth. I have watched all of the seasons of Murder, She Wrote and am still amazed at how wonderfully this character was portrayed by the great Angela Lansbury. I was a teenager when this show first aired, and remember dreaming of moving to a place like Cabot Cove (and sometimes still do!).

Anyway, I was saddened when this stellar show came to an end after many successful seasons. Then I discovered there were four made-for-TV movies made after the show ended. I managed to catch some of these shows on TV when they were aired, and only lately came to discover that they are available on DVD.

These are four full-length movies. In South by Southwest, Jessica gets entangled in espionage while traveling to El Paso by train. In A Story to Die For, Jessica attends a speakers' conference where a former director of the KGB is murdered. The prized manuscript which supposedly contains some classified information is missing. Jessica initially tries to stay out of it, but inevitably finds herself embroiled in the case. A Story to Die For is my favorite in this collection because it is the most philosophical of all four movies, dealing with friendship, trust, loyalty, and is also quite emotional.

In The Last Free Man, Jessica travels to a university in Virginia and inevitably becomes involved in a case that takes her back to the past, and where she discovers that one of her relatives back during the time of slavery was a progressive Southerner and an excellent sleuth herself (Lansbury plays a dual role here). The Celtic Riddle is set in Ireland and is another riveting mystery. Jessica has to deal with a killer who is determined not to let anyone get a fortune, one where Jessica herself is a beneficiary. Besides the riveting plot, the bonus is the beautiful cinematography.

Ardent fans of Murder, She Wrote should definitely watch these four movies, and those who are familiar with the show will enjoy identifying guest stars from TV's golden years. I highly recommend this 4-movie compilation for fans of the show, and just about anyone who enjoys a good mystery.",1336867200,73,2157,4.869209809264305
4506067,5,B004Z74X0M,"This DVD is an appropriate finish to a fantastic TV series.  These movies are pure Jessica Fletcher and are worth the price.  As an avid Murder, She Wrote fan I thoroughly enjoyed watching them all and they will make an excellent addition to my complete set of the TV series DVDs.",1335312000,,280,4.470588235294118
4506068,5,B004Z74X0M,"The four post-series television movies presented in this set mark the end of one of TV's longest running mystery dramas and give Angela Lansbury the chance to shine as Jessica Fletcher for the last time.

Produced between 1997 (the year after the show ended on CBS) and 2003 the very fact that these films were produced at all just goes to show how loved and adored Murder, She Wrote was and still is not just in the US but the world over. Not many shows make it to tweleve seasons let alone are given the chance to continue in the form of television films. But Murder, She Wrote is no ordinary television series. Featuring an older lead character, there was a distinct lack of sensationalism, sex, violence and gore which helped Murder, She Wrote to craft a cosy but well plotted character driven mystery each week for twelve successful years. And that formula is repeated here in the following movies:

South by Southwest (1997) - Jessica becomes embroiled in an FBI investigation when she befriends a woman on a train to Agua Verde who is the sole witness to a murder. Guest-starring Mel Harris, Ray Baker, Keith David.

A Story to Die For (2000) - Jessica is at a writers' conference to give a speech and meet with other writers when a controversial Russian author is found dead. Guest-starring Richard Crenna, Kathryn Morris, Steven Culp, Daniel Dae Kim, Robert Mailhouse.

The Last Free Man (2001) - Jessica travels to the Deep South where she uncovers a shocking link between her family history and the death of a slave in the 1860s. Guest-starring Phylicia Rashad, David Ogden Stiers, Elizabeth Lackey, Beth Grant.

The Celtic Riddle (2003) - Jessica travels once again to Ireland where she attends the reading of a will only for it to result in murder and the search for a lost treasure. Guest-starring Fionnula Flanagan, Sarah-Jane Potts, Cyril O'Reilly.

The four films are all equally enjoyable and are all strong stories worthy of the extended 90 minute running time. The strongest of the bunch has to be South by Southwest which is twist laden from start to finish and not only pits Jessica against a murderer but the FBI as well! The Celtic Riddle is also particularly strong and features occasional Murder, She Wrote guest-star Fionnula Flanagan and a couple of dodgy Irish accents aside is a really enjoyable hidden treasure adventure for Jessica. The Last Free Man is one of the more serious Murder, She Wrote stories dealing with the subject of slavery as well as murder. Jessica doesn't feature quite as much in this one as the others as a lot of the story is set in the 1800s but Angela is still present playing the dual role of her distant aunt Sarah. And finally, A Story to Die For is focused on the murder of a former member of the KGB and sees Jessica faced with the possibility that one of her friends or collegues may be responsible for the murder.

This set contains the four films accross two discs and unforutnalty comes without any special features. As it stands it appears that with this set, we have now seen the end of J.B. Fletcher onscreen. Angela Lansbury has spoken a few times over the years about her desire to return to the role but for some reason network executives haven't granted her wish. But with the original novels still going strong and the complete series now available on DVD, we will never really say goodbye to Jessica Beatrice Fletcher.",1333756800,4,3392,4.690756302521009
4506069,5,B004Z74X0M,"Angela Lansbury starred in twelve seasons of the incredibly successful Murder She Wrote from 1984 until 1996. The series started in the UK back in mid 1985 and quickly became a success. Weekly mysteries involving Jessica Fletcher solving a murder within the 45 minutes of each episode became a winning formula. Some episodes were shown nationally on ITV, some regionally but the show went on to have reruns on ITV, then BBC1 and BBC2 daytime on a seemingly constant loop for most of 2001 - 2010. Various cable channels including Granada Plus and Alibi have also had endless reruns of this classic. It is currently rerunning on ITV at weekend lunchtimes.
Murder She Wrote is harmless fun with no violence, no swearing , no sex, no shouting, just good old fashioned fine acting creating decent whodunnits. When the last episode of the last series was screened in America, ""Death by Demographic"", I assumed that Murder She Wrote had finally ended. Well not quite. Angela Lansbury was to return in four movie-length mysteries from the late 1990s until 2003. To this day I've seen them scheduled on ITV1 and ITV3 countless times. ITV must see the charm and reliability of screening Jessica to fill the daytime hours at the weekend.
Each mystery is just short of 90 minutes long and is a treat for any fans of the regular series.
- South By Southwest
- A Story To Die For
- The Last Free Man
- The Celtic Riddle

I doubt there will be any more made as Ms Lansbury is well into her 80s now. The last series I saw her in was in a guest role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order-Trial-by-Jury-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000E8JO2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order: Trial by Jury - The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;playing her part just as well as ever.

4506074,4,B004Z74X0M,"If you liked the old TV show, you'll love this DVD set, since these four TV movies haven't been available for years. ""South by Southwest"" and ""Celtic Riddle"" are excellent and are the best of the bunch. The main reasons they are great: Money was spent on the production and there are action scenes, and some real drama along the way. The other two movies -- ""A Story to Die For"" and ""Last Free Man"" -- are talky, have no co-stars (even from the show's traditional ""B"" and ""C"" lists) and must have been produced on a shoe-string budget; they take place almost entirely indoors.  But it's all vintage ""Murder, She Wrote"" and die-hard fans will cherish having four 90-minute episodes to watch on Sunday nights.",1330905600,7,707,4.611111111111111

8449452,4,B004Z74X0M,As a woman in her 30s I grew up watching Murder she wrote with my grandparents. Every summer vacation to our Florida house this was a guarantee every week to be watched. So of course I had to add this movie set to my season collection I received from my husband for Mother's day. Well..the first disc movies are great. Really seemed like an episode from the seasons. I was very pleased...but as i finished that disc and put in disc 2...not so pleased. Those two movies are extremely boring and more social agenda films. I won't watch disc 2 again. That being said for 20 bucks its definitely worth it for the first two films. Great addition to any MSW collector and lover! If you could buy the movies individually i would go that route.,1529193600,,736,4.419117647058823
