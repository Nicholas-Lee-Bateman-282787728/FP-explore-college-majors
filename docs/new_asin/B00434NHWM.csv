4253568,5,B00434NHWM,"It is so sad that a child must follow in the footsteps of their parents when it is not a good thing. A cycle must be broken so the future generations don't follow that same broken path. I work in institution and this happens. SHowed it to my group and they too said it was good and message was loud and clear. If you are going to follow, follow what is good and will get you somewhere.",1360800000,,385,4.012987012987013
4253569,3,B00434NHWM,"This is apparently based on a true story. Cain (Ving Rhames) is in prison. He remembers the incident when his wife was killed in a cross fire with Redfoot, who has now come to the same prison. There are scenes of 2 rival gangs dealing drugs, Cain's son is one of them and he ends up in the same prison. Cain's son doesn't want anything to do with his father who is now participating in a mentoring program for would-be criminals.

The movie is preachy, but the message is weak. Ving Rhames wasn't given an opportunity to display his full acting talents. Robert Patrick made a terrible warden. If the film is supposed to inspire young people to go straight, I believe it has missed its mark and might work as well as ""Reefer Madness"" did to end marijuana usage.

F-bomb, N-word, brief sex, nudity, fighting, killing, off camera male rape.",1337385600,2,837,4.5364238410596025
4253570,3,B00434NHWM,"caged animal is actually a three part movie, every movie that i've watched Ving Rhymes play in he has always captured my attention, he's a great actor who plays many different roles, at the end of the third part of this movie i was surprised to learn that this movie was based on a true story, it's hard to believe that prison life like this exist especially in out time, if you can get past all of the violence this really is a good movie.",1308700800,7,440,4.188235294117647
4253571,5,B00434NHWM,"ANOTHER REALITY OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS REALITY; IN THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE, THEY SHOWED SOME FACTS; OVER 60% OF PEOPLE INCARCERATED IN PRISONS ACCROSS THE COUNTRY ARE BLACK MEN, OUT OF THIS 60% OF BLACK MEN ACCROSS THE BOARD, 75% OF THEM ARE LOCKED-UP FOR DRUG SALES.

A SOCIAL CONDITION OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

EXCELLENT JOB, AS WE SAY IN NEW YORK, WE KEEP IT ""GULLI""-(IN IT'S TRUE NATURE--WE DONT SUGAR COAT ISSUES AND ACT LIKE THEY DON'T EXISIST) LIKE IN MANY STATES ACCROSS THE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY BOSTON, MA.",1307577600,4,549,4.89247311827957
4253572,4,B00434NHWM,"I will not write a synopsis of the movie, it has far to much ""x rated"" actions, language and imagery during the first 50 minutes that distract from the building message.  However, nearing the end you can see the light start to appear as love, salvation and eventually the belief that God exists enters into play.  This change is slow but the thoughts and life style sets in motion a positive change in the ""drug killing environment"" ending the lives of far to many youth caught up into the ""glamour"" of the ""riches"" of street life.  I could have, and perhaps should have given this movie a rating of 5 stars but the language throughout and the nudity, rape and homosexual activity in prison was to graphic for me.",1297555200,5,713,4.511627906976744

The acting is solid but the movie is slow.  I think the thing that bothered me most was the subtitles were practically a scene off.  That makes viewing and enjoyment very difficult.",1468368000,3,350,4.338461538461538
