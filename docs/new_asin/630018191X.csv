213742,4,630018191X,"In order to avoid arrest, A&C enlist in the army and get tangled in a romantic subplot involving a millionaire, his former valet, and a camp hostess.  Silly fun takes place on the eve of World War II, with Abbott and Costello scoring laughs and the Andrews Sisters singing ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"" and ""Apple Blossom Time.""  Funny, despite the silly romance.",1025222400,,359,4.774193548387097

213745,5,630018191X,"Made for peanuts, BUCK PRIVATES was a tremendous hit for Universal studios and firmly established Abbott and Costello as movie stars. Bud and Lou's routines are among their best; indeed, the film is really not much more  than a string of burlesque routines held together by a simple plotline.  ""The Dice Game,"" ""The Drill Routine,"" ""You're 40,  She's 10,"" and several others burlesque bits are here to keep you  laughing.  The romantic triangle plot is rather forgettable, although one  can certainly understand why both Lee Bowman and Alan Curtis are pursuing  lovely Jane Frazee.  The Andrews Sisters contribute some great songs,  including the immortal ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy.""  Dated but  still very entertaining, BUCK PRIVATES delivered just what the movie going  public needed in 1941.  And it still delivers today.",947376000,11,823,5.2384615384615385
213746,4,630018191X,"Abbott & Costello were just starting their movie careers when this military comedy was made, and their energy and freshness are obvious in this. The film was a huge hit in theaters and includes many of Bud and Lou's best routines. The romantic subplot, mandatory in 1941, isn't so compelling today, but fortunately Bud and Lou are never offscreen for  long. Good songs by The Andrews Sisters, and a dynamite jitterbug finale by  ""24 champion boogie-woogie dancers"" (credited that way in the  movie). If you like Abbott & Costello and have never seen this, grab it. Worth watching again and again.",944438400,,596,4.881188118811881

7803857,5,630018191X,Need to keep the Grand kids quiet just put on Bud & Lou in Buck Privates & they'll be to busy watching & you can even watch with them.  It's a very good movie but of course Bud & Lou do an outstanding job of acting.  They team up & work together & making you laugh is their goal & they really do it in Buck Private.  This movie is good for the adults & any age in between. If you don't like Buck Privates then you don't like comedy.,1313798400,4,432,3.7777777777777777
7803858,5,630018191X,As soon as I got this movie in I plugged it in at work (hospital) and everyone was laughing!!  Good clean fun for all ages a classic and a must have!!!!!!,1195603200,3,154,3.967741935483871
7803859,5,630018191X,"The Army has never been so much fun as when Bud and Lou sign up for their Uncle Sam. Made to capitalize on their  sudden popularity, a fine cast and breezy tone overcome the slight premise and give the boys an opportunity for some of their most hilarious gags. Add the fabulous Andrew Sisters to the mix and you've got a great time at the movies.

Slicker (Bud) and Herbie (Lou) are selling ties without a permit but when they duck into what they think is a movie theatre they end up enlisting in the army! This gives our favorite comedy duo a chance to display both their slapstick ability and their fabulous verbal routines. Nat Pendleton is the perfect foil as their Sergeant. As usual, Bud continues to get Lou into hot water, but it seems more of a gag here, rather than mean-spirited, with Bud coming off a bit softer than in later films. Groucho Marx didn't call him the greatest straight-man in the history of comedy for nothing.

Shemp Howard of the Three Stooges gets a nice bit as K Company's cook. He and Lou even get to do a number together! Most of the songs are done by the always great Andrew Sisters, however. They get to do the romantic ""I'll Be With You in Apple Blossom Time"" and some breezy war songs on the train to bootcamp and at company dances which keep things moving right along.

The secondary story is actually pretty good here, and is not distracting at all. Lee Bowman is very good as the rich playboy (Randoph Parker III) used to getting things his way, and Alan Curtis is equally good as his opposite, Bob Martin. Both are after the lovely Judy Gray (Jane Frazee) who gets to sing ""I Wish You Were Here"" and brightens the film every time she appears. Director Arthur Lubin has to be given some credit for keeping this part of the story interesting and not simply using it as a filler until Bud and Lou reappear.

It will all come to a satisfying conclusion after a simulated battle against Blue Company. But not before Herbie is tricked into entering the ring in a camp boxing match as ""The Human Buzzsaw."" The fight is a hoot and so is much of this film, when it's not being breezily entertaining. Seeing this fun film which was made with a slight script and meager budget will remind you of what's wrong with the movies today. A good time for Abbott and Costello fans.",1186272000,3,2303,4.409411764705882
7803860,5,630018191X,"I loved this movie!  Not because I'm a fan of Abbott and Costello, but because I'm a huge Andrews Sisters fan and they are featured very prominently in this film.  In fact, they do the entire ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"" number in this movie as well as many others. It is a great way to see the Andrews Sisters perform and sing. I recommend it highly!",1183334400,2,348,4.257575757575758
7803861,4,630018191X,"Buck Privates, 1941 film

This was the first big hit for Abbott & Costello. The boys are peddling ties on the street, and duck into an Army recruiting station to escape a policeman. There are the usual sight gags and verbal jokes that made them the top comics of the 1940s. The Andrews Sisters provide the songs. A steam train takes the inductees to their training camp. [Note how all the men wore suits, ties, and hats.] There is a funny scene where Lou Costello learns how to play with dice. He is a fast learner! The next lesson shows a lesson in finance. Then a playboy gets a chance to learn things they don't teach in college. There is a humorous lesson in teaching close-order drill. Then another comedy routing.

There is a shooting match that is lost when the top marksman develops a problem to stay out; he is shunned. We see some rough crude humor in the boxing match. [Lou Costello shows his skill as a physical comedian.] Next morning there is a sham battle as a training exercise. Real army films are included for realism. Three patrols are set out to capture and destroy a guardhouse. One patrol manages to accomplish their mission. There is a party to celebrate, and we see a dance and song from that era. A side bet at 10-to-1 allows Company K to clean up. There is a final big number to end the film.

A few months later in December 1941 the nation changed forever. But the need for entertainment went on, and so did Abbot & Costello in other comedies.",1179878400,,1470,4.416974169741698
7803862,5,630018191X,"Bud Abbott and Lou Costello's second film for Universal and the first in which they get star billing, has them playing two con men who ACCIDENTALLY enlist in the Army in order to avoid getting arrested.

  Slicker Smith and Herbie Brown are street peddlers selling neck ties while constantly running from the police. To escape an officer they run into an Army Recruiting Station (in a vacant movie theater). Through a misunderstanding, they are recruited into the U.S. Army. They are sent off to boot camp to find out their drill instructor is the very same cop who chased them into the recruiting station in the first place. The boys have a hilarious time frustrating their humorless drill instructor.

  TRIVIA: (1)Abbott and Costellos drill routine ran only two-and-a-half minutes in the script, but was allowed five minutes of screen time because of their ad-libbing. Much of their dialogue in the film was ad-libbed.(2)During WWII, the Japanese used to show the ""DRILL ROUTINE"" to show how stupid the American Army was. (3)A sneak preview was held in late January 1941 for soldiers at Fort MacArthur, California.(4)This film took in $4,000,000, more than either ""CITZEN KANE"" (1941) or ""HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY"" (1941).",1121990400,2,1376,4.995575221238938
