5852683,3,B00DSAUH0W,"Contrary to many folks, I'm a big Keanu fan. I was ready for a real legal thriller but instead what I got were wooden, unbelievable performances from the son Mike and the wife played by Renee Zellwegger. Even worse, the entire film relied on building tension, but never once released it. It also never tied up the story clearly or in any depth, instead opting to give us the answer in a couple of minutes in the end. But even then, there was little nuance to how the actual crime was committed or the motivations of the perpetrators. Also, the second chair lawyer's part seemed completely disposable, she was never developed as a character and her entire demeanor seemed overwrought without cause.

It's like the relied far too much on emotions and forgot to tell the story. Still, not a horrible but wow and Keanu was good as always. Just think they could have done so much more with the story. Maybe it needed to be a 2 hr movie, instead of 1:24? It came close to being great, but then just seemed to slip away into nothingness.",1477785600,20,1030,4.4787234042553195

5852685,3,B00DSAUH0W,"Keanu Reeves seems to reprise the same role in all of his films, to wit, ""The Cro-Magnon with a Heart of Gold.""  I DO like him as an actor --  somehow it works, his shtick, works all the way back to Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. Hey, if it ain't broke ...

This isn't a daring movie.  And there was some multi-tasking going on in the casa at points along the way.  But it works, hits the spot, kinda like a decent cheeseburger after an eight-day bender on Indian food.  Sure, maybe I should know better ...",1477699200,2,510,4.206185567010309

5852688,5,B00DSAUH0W,"This courtroom murder mystery kept me engaged to the end. The case takes on an added dimension when the defendant has a legal mind of his own. Well written and with interesting characters, my favorite being a young attorney with a history of mental illness and a ""world-class bulls*** detector"" which serves her well. The legal proceedings had an air of verisimilitude.",1477267200,13,369,4.967741935483871
5852689,4,B00DSAUH0W,"I'm a sucker for courtroom drama movies, and Keanu Reeves as a defense attorney for the accused doesn't disappoint. Even though there are some big names in this movie (an almost unrecognizable Renee Zellweger and a - WOW - huge Jim Belushi), it's Keanu who carries it. And although the story is a bit slow (so as not to confuse the viewer more than necessary - lots of twist and turns, remember?) it wasn't one I could walk away from as the story unfolds through flashbacks. I truly enjoyed the movie and give it a well-earned 4-stars.",1477180800,42,535,4.525773195876289
5852690,2,B00DSAUH0W,"Mike Lester (Garbriel Basso) is on trial for murder, found kneeling over the victim, prints on the weapon and confesses to the crime. Ramsey (Keanu Reeves) is a close friend of the family and his attorney who is trying to get Mike off, Mike who is not speaking. Mike's abusive father (Jim Belushi) was the victim. The only other person in the house was Mike's abused mother Loretta (Renee Zelleger) who was in the shower and Ramsey shows up rather quickly.

The film is a courtroom drama with flashbacks. It isn't hard to figure out all the twists. With Mike being much for mute of the film, there was a real lack of drama or urgency as Mike was content to go down with the crime.

Early in the film a woman enters a limo who looks like Britney while a Britney Spears riff is being played. BTW it does take place in Louisiana.

into their parts. Their movement and speech was 'wooden' throughout.
The twist was ok as a final choice for a 'surprise ending' but I wasn't feeling it.
I did find the mix of potential surprise endings before the twist, predictable.
Rene Z can still act, despite her changed facial appearance - actually worked well for her role.

This is probably the only thing that bothered me. They added some anti-conservative propaganda into the film. Obviously a ploy to influence the way people vote by  making the least likeable character right wing. Just more proof that Hollywood really is controlled by liberals.

5852742,4,B00DSAUH0W,"It is a good movie. There are a few pieces missing or not explained, but overall, I really enjoyed it.

Rene Zellweger was really excellent. She played her battered wife character very well and I believed her story for the most part.

Gabriel Basso may have been good, but he didn't do much acting. Most of the time he sat in court quietly never speaking. Near the end of the movie, he did take the stand and later conversed with people but it wasn't much of an opportunity to get a feel for him.

Gugu Mbatha-Raw was the wrong person for her role as second chair. She was uninteresting and bland. When she cross-examined a witness she seemed frightened and incompetent even though she did get an important answer from the witness.

I am a Keanu Reeves fan and although I don't think this was his best performance, I still think he's a great actor and did what he could with his part.

It is engaging and generally easy to follow. The ending really surprised me, and I hope it surprises you too.",1526083200,,995,4.415300546448087

5852783,2,B00DSAUH0W,"The Whole Truth is a ""who really dunnit"" film that doesn't quite come together as well as one would expect. Two of my biggest issues are, Janelle (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) is almost totally unnecessary in the film except for being the key example of what really happened during the events that led to murder. The scene where she reveals how she went from being a hot shot lawyer for a reputable firm in the big city to being carted off to the puzzle factory, doped up on meds and left in a back water town is foreshadowing that reveals the film's entire plot half way through the film. The other indicator is a simple question of why is Richard (Keanu Reeves), the family lawyer, hanging out at his client's estate? Under many circumstances, high priced lawyers don't have friends, they have clients. Lawyers can be worse than high priced pros in this regard (see: Carrie Ann Moss in Jessica Jones). Each time a client sees or speaks to their high priced lawyer, it's a billable hour if not services provided via an expensive as all get out retainer. They never just ""hang out"" because that high up the ladder lawyers aren't even human anymore. That was a dead giveaway too in my opinion.

As a result the film becomes predictable by playing it's hand far too early and then making it worse by giving additional indicators to strengthen what was revealed making the twist at the end totally ineffective. Generally speaking, the acting was serviceable. Keanu Reeves was okay, but he gave a much better performance as a lawyer in Devil's Advocate. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is wasted in this film but she did okay working with a script that did nothing for her character. Rene Zellweger (Loretta) was okay but even her part in the film was kinda lame because the twists that could have made her character more interesting, strengthening the divide between her and the husband, causing chaos with the neighbors, the writer/director's feet were too cold to go there. Sleep with the neighbors kid. All the components were right there in the story but just when you thought that particular development was going to take place, which would have made sense in a twisted way considering the marriage in question and Loretta's character, that entire plot device vanished unfulfilled.

Even the story of the flight attendant was lame, because it was left undeveloped. Half details mentioned but never explored even in the context of the trial. Mike (Gabriel Basso) and his dad Boone (Jim Belushi) are on the private jet and in the midst of sexually harassing the flight attendant as she bends over a few feet from them, Boone makes lewd remarks to his son about ""handling her"" as they stare at her behind. He then whispers something to him that is later revealed in the film but only then the reveal is said to be a lie. No mile high scene? No discomfort as Mike tries to convince the flight attendant to sleep with him on the plane to impress his dad. No scandal as Boone convinces the flight attendant to sleep with his son on the jet? Any one of those scenarios would have provided better context and development for the main point of the story but noooooo, we can't have nice things.

2* I didn't like it. The Whole Truth places components for a great murder story/court drama in motion but reveals the punchline too soon (for those that pay attention) leaves details undeveloped that could have made the film more interesting and too many characters are almost totally forgettable.",1523232000,,3457,4.710743801652892
5852784,5,B00DSAUH0W,"This was a really good movie. I am really surprised with the ending of the movie, I never imagined it would end that way.

On my late 65+ scale of dozing off during movies, I can say this one kept my attention throughout and was a ""no-dozer"".

5852855,4,B00DSAUH0W,"This is a movie that you HAVE to watch til the end.  This was a good movie.  It was slow moving like most court room dramas are.  There's a twist you can see coming from a mile away and you're waiting the entire movie for the actors to just come out with it already!  However, after there's another twist that took me by surprise and was totally unexpected.  You can just feel the tension jumping off the screen at you during some of the cross-examinations. The acting is definitely on par for everyone.  Keanu's aloof manner suits the character well- if you watch til the end. The movie is good for a second watch as well.

I'm tempted to give it five stars because it was good and I did enjoy it overall. However it was slow. I know this is typical of courtoom dramas, to be slow but it is a slow movie, there's just no way around it. So the movie is slow but it IS good and one of the better and creative courtroom dramas I've seen.",1517961600,,935,4.161111111111111

Renee Z ""abused wife acting"" seemed more like ""aw crap, I have to do one more movie so I don't break my contract."" Keanu Reeves, while always fun to look at, continued his role as the wooden guy that he seems to play in all his films. I don't think they used any actual lawyers to consult with to write the courtroom scenes.

There are so many questions I have, but to ask them here would spoil the movie. If you want to watch a badly written movie about what could have been a suspenseful mystery, watch this. Ask yourself ""why did they do that?"" or ""where did that come from""?"" Then ask how they got the money to finance this project because if I was the head honcho and I read this script, I would have sent it back to a team of different writers and legal consultants to rewrite the whole thing.",1516492800,,885,4.267857142857143

5852896,4,B00DSAUH0W,"Who knew?  I was really surprised -- though in places it looked like Keanu was copying his understated gestures from Harrison Ford.  The 'twist' was kind of an eye-rolling gratuity -- what really happened makes perfect sense, but how it happened makes zero sense.  Courtroom dramas just have to have a twist, don't they?  The 'twist' did nothing for me.  The good stuff in this film is all that raw rockgut life stuff between Keanu Reeves and Gugu Mbatha-Raw, who plays his newbie assistant defense attorney.  Keanu asks her casually ""So what got you thrown into a mental hospital?""  When Mbatha-Raw feels an ethical impulse to betray her oath as a slimey defense attorney, Keanu digs in:  ""This is really about your obsessive sex life, isn't it?""  By far the best scene is Mbatha-Raw's cross-examination of the flight attendant. Ethically, she's not cut out for slimey cut-throat legal practice, but she channels the DNA of her father (a brilliant trial lawyer whom we never meet in the film) as she instinctively destroys the witness in anxious slow motion.  Without Mbatha-Raw's character (and her excellent acting), this would have been a mediocre knockoff formulaic courtroom drama we've seen too many times to care.  Instead, it shows pretty convincingly that a criminal trial has everything to do with manipulation, and nothing to do with the truth, whole or otherwise.",1515542400,7,1376,5.0176211453744495

5852950,3,B00DSAUH0W,"If you were looking for an actor to play a top notch criminal defense attorney in a tricky courtroom thriller, Keanu Reeves probably wouldnt be your first choice. For all of Reevess strengths, the art of masterful oration and persuasion isn't one of them. Nonetheless, he stars in just such a movie, The Whole Truth. With Reeves providing frequent voiceover narration and the bulk of the legalistic theatrics in the movie, the result, not surprisingly is a film thats rather short on suspense and excitement, despite some dizzying plot twists.

Reeves plays Richard Ramsey, a Louisiana defense attorney, who is hired by an old family friend, Loretta Lassiter (Renee Zellweger) to defend her teenage son Mike (Gabriel Basso), who is accused of murdering his father, Boone (Jim Belushi). Mike was arrested sitting next to the body, holding a bloody knife. Its a tough case for Ramsey to win, especially since Mike hasn't spoken to anyone since the day he was arrested.

The Whole Truth is pretty much of a barebones production, with almost all the scenes taking place in and around the courtroom. The film begins as the trial is getting ready to start, and the audience gradually fills in the details through a series of flashbacks usually tied to the testimony of various witnesses. The picture that emerges from the various flashbacks during the trial doesnt help Mikes case. Boone is revealed to be a drunken, abusive jerk, cruel to both Mike and his mother, giving him ample motive to kill his father. But, after about an hour of scenes in which one witness after another helps the prosecution build its case, Mike drops a bombshell in Ramsey, demanding to testify without telling Ramsey what hes going to say.

Screenwriter Nicholas Kazan (writing under a pseudonym) has a history of coming up with complex, morally conflicted storylines, such as the script for Reversal of Fortune, and he drops some bombshells in The Whole Truth that are worthy of Scott Turow, beginning with the nature of Mikes testimony. In the right hands, this movie could have been a crackerjack thriller, and, indeed, at one time Daniel Craig was slated to star. However, Keanu Reeves is not Daniel Craig, and he takes a far more low-key approach to the material, even the most sensational moments, so that most of the courtroom scenes lack the spark they should have in a film like this. Ironically, the courtroom scene that has the most impact is the examination of a minor witness who is forced to walk back some of her testimony. That scene seems to have been lifted from a superior courtroom movie and dropped in here.

Reeves is not the only acting culprit either. Renee Zellweger, who did The Whole Truth before her last Bridget Jones movie, doesnt show all that much energy as the abused, wronged woman. The only actors who really make an impression are Belushi, good in a rare dramatic role, and young Basso.

Although The Whole Truth squanders much of its potential, its not bad for a weekend movie night at home, especially in comparison with a lot of direct-to-video dreck out there. The story itself is solid, and the twists are good, even though the execution is frequently faulty. In particular, the ending appears a bit rushed, although that may be more a consequence of director Courtney Hunt trying to move past some plot holes that probably wouldnt stand up to close scrutiny. I would rate the movie at 2.5 stars, rounded up to three on the strength of its various twists. The Whole Truth won't be the whole package for would-be viewers, but it is good enough to get a directed verdict.",1513814400,,3583,4.810064935064935

5852965,2,B00DSAUH0W,"it's a two to three star movie, mostly suffering from the plot.  movies like this one tend to be 'good' when you have a chance figuring out what is going on, this movie has more of a blind twist that gets dropped on you.  i found myself to be less interested because there were no 'clues' to draw me into paying more attention to the story, and any plot turn wasn't rewarding because there was no foreshadowing or clues to pick up on.

the silence of the defendant did nothing to add suspense to the story, and inclusion of the assistant lawyer was pretty unnecessary and didn't serve the story in any meaningful way.  I have some other complaints, but i don't want to spoil anything for someone who hasn't watched it.

i would recommend this to Keanu Reeves fans and anybody who is a courtroom crime drama junkie who is looking for something entertainment-like to pass some time.  anyone who tries to catch most of these types of movies will find this passable; anyone looking for a well written and plausible story will be left a bit flat.",1513123200,4,1041,4.481481481481482

The writing was solid all around, other than Keanu trying to make a line sound intense and bad-boy about simply getting dinner as the scene changes.

There is nothing new to the story...it's been done and redone by Hollywood so many times over the years that anybody that has been watching movies with any regularity would recognize the overused ploy right away. Heck, I think I even may have watched dozens of various TV shows that all used the same recipe at one time or another.

5853057,4,B00DSAUH0W,"This was one of Keanu's better movies in recent years since the Matrix trilogy. I have been a fan of his for many years now, but haven't liked many of the types of movies he's done in recent years. I do, however, appreciate the depth and breadth of his acting ability and skill. He can play anything! More than that, what makes a good actor isn't always having the best or the most lines but also allowing your co-actors their time to shine. He did this so well in this movie. The girl who played his character's co-chair did a wonderful job with her role. She and the others in the scenes with Keanu did very good jobs. Even the guy that played the DA. I was in fact surprised that the young man playing Mike, the accused standing trial, was cast as a supporting actor. It is not nearly as easy as it looks to play a scene where one says nothing. More than one takes some real skill! I think he should have been cast as a main actor, also. His performance was incredible, as were the other main actors.

The whole movie was good. It felt like a throwback to the 80's and early 90's when good movies were in abundance. It was also incredibly refreshing to not have foul language thrown around like common household words. This movie is a thinker's movie. No thrills, no chills, no action-hero scenes. However, there was a twist or two and plenty of drama & good writing. Kudos to the director, producer, and in fact the whole team that put this film together!

My only negative was that there was a wee bit too much showing of the husband-wife relationship that should have been behind closed doors, even if it could been seen as relevant to parts of the story. I think it could have been suggested, rather than shown.

On the whole, this film was artfully and tastefully done, even including the little quirk of full roundabout with the scene at the beginning and the end. I can see this movie becoming a classic one day, in the same vein as James Stewart's Rear Window became in its day.",1510272000,,1989,4.370270270270271

The biggest weakness was the young legal assistant, played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw.  She seems to have studied at the TV soap opera school of exaggerated and uncalled-for facial expressions: constantly making emoji-like grimaces to express surprise, puzzlement, etc.  This was a constant irritant.

His character displays a slight range of emotion that is convincing. I actually think this movie shows he can act and it was refreshing to see him in a role other than martial artist, cop, FBI agent and the like. The other actors a good too.

Keanu Reeves is once again void of any emotion and walks through another movie without adding much at all to it. However, he does add much more than either Renee Zellweger or Gugu Mbatha-Raw and if you can figure out why the later was even in this one more power to you. It played out like an old TV movie and its just a slow moving drama with little to hold your interest but even less to not finish it. Its far from 5-star territory and for those who put it out there you have to wonder if this is about the best theyve ever seen.",1509840000,2,631,4.096774193548387

Well written, great production and I consider very well acted by all the main leads.  Gugu Mbatha-Raw is always first class and I totally disagree with the reviewer who so denigrated Keanu Reeve's acting.  I consider he did an excellent job with this movie; without spoilers, he was after all having to hold together a very big secret and most people's way of doing that is to come across as very measured.  Renee Zellweger and Gabriel Russo were also very good.  As with others here, the twist at the end is unexpected and yet believable.

One dimensional, expressionless and insulting to the script is my opinion of what Reeves did to this film.

They could have gone a little deeper with some of the main themes, and definitely could've left other things out, such as the co-counsel's back story, since it, in no way, furthered the plot as she has all of about 10 lines throughout the film.

It's not that its a bad movie it just isn't  a movie I would have paid to watch.  Keanu Reeves is a better actor than this movie lets him be and Reene Z doesn't add enough to this movie to even deserve billing.

Reeves portrays the lawyer, representing a young, law-student on trial for the murder of the young man's father. From the moment the assistant to the lawyer and the Mother of the son exchange glances, the viewer knows what's going on. Crystal clear plot-line ahead and it's so easy to see it with no surprises. Even the assistant lawyer is suspicous of Reeves' character and the mother of the accused. I didn't like the ending at all, for justice was not served. The movie was just too predictible for any surprises. I would like to add that the actress portraying the lawyer's assistant did an excellent job of acting. That's the only reason I gave it one star, because of Her. This was not a good role for Reeves or Zellweger.",1508889600,2,805,4.676056338028169

It still leaves a person guessing as to whether is was the mother or her lover who did it.  The person who played the mother did a great job in making herself easy to dislike.

He seemed two dimensional, and there was no trace of emotion, compassion or humanity. That's who he was...who they all were...The brilliant assistant  stole this movie, confessing her tragic history.  confessing the truth about herself. If we could have seen it all through her eyes, especially as she began to know,l, we would have become keenly aware that she embodied  courage and integrity..while the other characters did not..Funny that she lead the cast, yet was portrayed as  just an incidental player.

It IS distracting to the film to see her look so different , because she was such a wonderful actress with such a beautifully expressive natural face before the newly carved face.  I can't say this role challenged her at all.  The story line?  Well....  If you can believe a jury would convict on the grounds without a shred of evidence--perhaps.  Or, if you think a small town environment and the wealthy circle are so tight and so powerful and so obtuse as to ignore details of the cimr not adding up. ....  Meh.  This was entertainment.  It didn't raise my awareness to anything new, useful, meaningful or important.  It could've been an episode of Law & Order.  If you want real court room battles, see Trials at Nuremburg--if you haven't seen it.  The old one with Spencer Tracy, Richard Widmark, and Maximilian Schell.  See 'Presumed Innocent'.  'Inherit the Wind'  'Ten Angry Men'  The defense was weak, the premise for defense unfounded...  I don't think the jury would've decided what it did.  And I didn't care, really, about one character in this story.  They were not personable, upstanding, out for truth or justice.

5853364,5,B00DSAUH0W,"I absolutely love a courtroom drama and this storyline has the feel of an evenly-paced hot and sticky afternoon in the deep south of Louisiana. For some reason, the setting appealed to me with the look and tone of this film and how the drama and building tension revealed itself while in court. Attorney Richard Ramsey (Keanu Reeves) is defending a younger client. The charge is patricide by the teenaged son, Mike Lassiter (Gabriel Basso) who is a child prodigy soon to be off to college. A brutal stabbing occurs in this affluent family of his father, Boone (Jim Belushi). This had taken place at the Lassiter household while his wife, Loretta (Renee Zellweger), was through with exercising then was in the shower. Basically, this is the setup for the film but it does include much more as far as the details and how they may change or they may not for you. At the beginning, in the courtroom, Ramsey is handling this case alone with his defendant. His co-chair arrives right at the beginning of the trial, Janelle Brady (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). I felt when she came onboard; a bit more grit came along with her to the storyline. Her father is an upscale lawyer and says of her that she is a world-class bull**** detector which would always come in handy while defending a case and she is able to prove that straight away to Ramsey.

The film is voiced over by Reeves to fill in the blanks of different points of interest concerning the court process and also minor details he may know of this prominent family in town. These are all heard on and off throughout this courtroom drama. I found this film to be quite intriguing even with the more laid-back styling while in the court (no computers, using legal pads and folders, stale looking room, etc.) A major part of the narrative is told through flashing back to illustrate the witness testimony while on the stand so you do get a good amount of viewing of Jim Belushi acting as the father who is deceased at the outset of the film. This way, he can be seen as in real time. Written by Rafael Jackson and directed by Courtney Hunt, steering the plot this particular way more so leaves one to wonder if it is plainly an objective view of what is said from each witness to take the stand because we could only rely on their personal accounts. It could have been from points of view that you may not be sure of - as far as, is this The Whole Truth or does this witness have a vested reason to evade it? Along with these additions to the trial, it is in your lap to figure out the ways it twists or turns, when and if, they happen along with what I thought was a satisfying ending.",1485475200,17,2625,4.4235537190082646

Thank God for mental mathematics. I can't tell more than that, but if you like ""mysteries,"" this is not the film for you - the only ""mystery"" is how anyone as a writer thought they could keep us in suspense for that long with such a transparent plot.

Good for a night in and doesn't require too much attention to follow along.
Some of the twists and turns are intriguing but you may see some of them coming unless you're a novice to Thriller Mysteries.
I can see this one being seen as a hidden gem several years down the road since it's not making a lot of waves and will more than likely age well.
I wouldn't have known Renee Zellweger was in this movie if I hadn't read some of the reviews after I'd watched the movie. Hardly recognizable.
Good performances by all and Keanu is Keanu.

Everyone here is fine. They deliver fine performances but are held down by a mediocre script. Keanu is fine as the lawyer who is trying to get off his friend's son for murdering his father. Not really a whole lot for him to do. Renee Zellwegger is good as the battered and broken wife, does well considering the majority of her role is in flashbacks and she spends the majority of the ""present"" sitting silently in the courtroom.

Watch it when it comes on netflix or tv cause there is nothing new you here. It's a passable story with a lame ending.",1478822400,,751,4.28169014084507

So he and his leggy, luscious lawyer lady co-worker Janelle reside in a motel during the trial, transporting himself to and fro upon an unlikely moped  do what must be done, I suppose.

Overall, the victimizer Boone was a despicable sort through and through, an abusive, overbearing and imposing goon, a misdirected masochist to be sure, who most probably did deserve the fate handed him, yet it is still the responsibility of jurisprudence to determine if justice was truly done; and in this case, through a bit of misdirection and bravery on the defendants part, a bit of cathartic revenge and boiled-over frustrations combined with outrage did transpire, and so the rotten does not survive to abuse another without consent.

This film is not for everyone. It's low-key and moves slowly at times. I had no problem with this. But if you want a lot of action, you need to look elsewhere.

I kept thinking I knew who the killer was, but my suspicions kept bouncing all over the place. She did it; no, he did it; no, it was really that person; no, wait, it was this character over here. I was wrong on all counts.

The script is very clever and held my interest throughout. Just when I thought I knew what was going on, the story threw me a curve ball. I love that kind of thing.
