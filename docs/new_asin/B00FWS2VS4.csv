8618989,5,B00FWS2VS4,"Awesome and unique vocaloid concert.  One of the best to date.  Great band performance, huge stage and projection screens.  Great songs and animation.  Only one possible problem with this Blu-ray set is that the 2nd bonus disc is in DVD format, and region specific to Japan.  My Blu-ray player could not play it.  Otherwise, the main concert disk is good quality video and sound.  The included concert guide book contains interviews with band and production crew, but entirely in Japanese.  Lyrics and subtitles also are Japanese.",1447545600,2,530,5.0813953488372094
