7793002,5,075662827X,"My 8 year old daughter loves the Eywitness DVDs!  We have several and they are all educational and entertaining. These are great for kids who are into science but if you're looking for a regular movie (plot, characters) you probably won't enjoy these.",1439769600,,251,4.837209302325581
7793003,1,075662827X,"This was not what we thought it was. It was advertised with the FISH! book, and has no relation to the book. It was very misleading.",1210291200,5,132,4.115384615384615
7793004,1,075662827X,"I also was under the impression this DVD went with the ""Fish!"" motivational book. $20 to have a stupid documentary about fish sent all the way to Australia.  I eagerly waited 6 weeks for my exciting ""Fish"" DVD, to share with my workmates - I just hope they have forgotten and don't ask me where it is - HOW EMBARRASSING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1205280000,10,334,4.475409836065574

7793006,1,075662827X,"When amazon places a book and a video together you would think they belong together.  Don't buy anything that states ""no image available"".  I didn't receive what was advertised both times I ordered the product.  The book Fish!  does not go with the DVD Fish!, they are selling a video about fish, not about customer service pike fish market.",1204243200,20,341,4.728813559322034
