5299680,2,B009AMAJBO,"SPOILER ALERT (Episode 1)

With the realization that network television has to appeal to the common denominator, I still had a small hope that the writers would ""borrow"" from the works of say William R. Forstchen (One Second After), David Crawford (Lights Out) or even S. M. Stirling (Novel of Change Series). Unfortunately, what was actually produced was the aforementioned ""Hot Mess!""

1.) While we don't know the cause, I can't imagine that an event strong enough to take down everything electric and combustion engines and solar powered devices and batteries and make modern firearms useless, would not cause the lights to go out in a synchronized format? For example, how was it that when the Matheson household went dark, the power across the street didn't go till they walked out on their balcony? Same thing with the car lights going off when Miles broke down

2.) In that apparently the ""event"" also caused modern firearms to become ineffective (by virtue of the fact that most of the militia are either carrying muskets or cross bows and there is no conceivable way to claim scarcity after only 15-years), yet somehow the Captain of the militia has a functioning ""45?"" Perhaps this will be explained at some point in future episodes, though it is a glaring inconsistency

3.) Nice orderly crops growing, everyone appearing to be well fed with a brief moderators comment that ""millions had died!""

4.) Security. While there was evidence of a feeble looking wooden fence/gate surrounding the living area, it didn't appear that the crops were protected (no evidence of patrols) and there didn't seem too much thought given to creating a defensible perimeter. It was alluded to that they were ""under the protection"" of the Monroe Militia, though that didn't seem to include armed guards

5.) On the 2nd night out on their trip to Chicago, they make camp inside a plane, which is both highly visible and has a fair amount of open area surrounding it, yet they don't feel that it is necessary to post a watch? This is despite the constant warnings re: thieves, bandits et al

6.) We are supposed to believe that an attractive woman living by herself in a structure with no security features and with only a double barreled shot gun (another inconsistency) to protect herself, had not fallen victim to a predator?

I do understand that a TV serialized version of the road would likely be too morose for the mainstream, however, choosing to go with a combined concept of SyFy (a la Stirling) and an TEOTWAWKI scenario (a la Forstchen et al) is ambitious enough. Unfortunately, Revolution is rife with glaring omissions on both sides of the equations' for reason that I can only guess are either a sacrifice for production or poor research.

I like the heavy set former Google millionaire that had ""$80-million in the bank"" when the lights went out and Charlie with her barely covering midriff shirts and nice ""bounce"" when she walks is attractive enough. Also, there was one pretty good (if not realistic) action sequence. I just don't believe that it is enough to hold true fans of the dueling genres and whether there will be enough casual interest for the series to last a full year.",1347926400,8,3188,4.824175824175824

Revolution is about the world trying to re-adjust to the darkness, and politically speaking, everyone was trying to be the first in line so they could see. In a matter of speaking. Only a few people knew about those particles. That was the enemy. The invader. And they lived inside the electricity.

5299932,4,B009AMAJBO,"I stumbled by this one in my recommendations and gave it a go. It is another post apocalypse survival tale - and I love them. The plot is someone or something has turned the power off. No more internet no more computers no more life as we know it. Luckily guns still work - phew.

We meet Charlie who has her father killed and brother kidnapped on the same day by the evil leader of Monroe County and his bunch of loyal - if slightly dysfunctional - militia. She has to find her estranged uncle (Miles) and get her bro back. Meantime's she is helped by step mom and Computer geek Aaron. All is never as it seems as the plot gets thicker by the episode and there are real surprises in every episode.

We travel to different parts of the US and find how each county is working differently and life is essentially cheap wherever you go, so being able to kick some bottom (as it were) comes in real handy.

This is a `sit back and enjoy the action' series; but that is only on one level. There is a fair bit more once you scratch the surface and that is one of its real strengths. The acting is all top notch and the action is always guaranteed in nigh on every of the twenty episodes. It is also more addictive than chocolate flavoured beer and I have really enjoyed watching it. There are loads of little things that you can nitpick about, but that would be churlish for what has been a complete surprise for me and a very pleasant one at that - roll on series 2.",1438387200,2,1461,4.192170818505338

5300043,5,B009AMAJBO,Very creative and attention grabbing story line. The potential of this particular scenario actually happening I don't think is realistic but at the same time I don't think it's too far from a potential realistic situation. It's causes you to think how dependent we are on resources and the need for a back up plan. It also puts me in mind of War of the Worlds with respect to the lengths people will go to when there is perceived scarcity - even to the point of killing others to survive.

5300045,5,B009AMAJBO,"Best show I've ever watched! Was never such a fan of a TV show till this came on the air in 2012. This is what got me into TV shows especially dystopian ones. If you're into dystopian, apocalypse type shows this is for you! I've watched LOST, Jericho, The Event, Fringe, Under The Dome and Revolution is up there with LOST. 5/5 no doubt about it and I definitely recommend this to everybody however often I can. When this was cancelled by NBC there was a revolution by its fans. They cancel a show titled REVOLUTION, they should have expected some resistance, right? 90k signatures in its petition and it is now coming back in a comic book form, so that right there says a lot. Revolution includes some conspiracy theories, and dark nefarious organizations. You have to use your mind though, some things are subliminal and only an active viewer will pick up on.

This show took that one step further, in episode 9, at the cement factory, there are several bad guys all with M-16 assault rifles and gun fight ensues. One of the young stars of the show, Jason, is able to take out two of the bad guys with his bow and arrows. WTF!!!

I don't understand why writers/producers/directors of these shows do this. There are some simple fixes such as:

Give the good guys the same fire power and weapons that the bad guys have.

Dumb down the fire power the bad guys have, so it is equal to what the good guys have.

If those suggestions are not that easy to accomplish, then on occasion, how about having the good guys say oh wait, they have M-16s, lets try not to get into a fire fight with them.",1422489600,,910,4.206896551724138

The show starts off slowly as we get to know each character and what they did in their previous lives when there was electricity.
All governments around the world have collapsed including the one in the United States being replaced by marauding gangs and semi governments in different regions on the United States.
It is here at the "" Monroe Republic "" that we are introduced to Sebastian Monroe and his ruthless ambition to expand his dictatorship at any cost.
As the story unfolds we learn how and why the power went out and the unforeseen consequences of this and those who were responsible for it.

5300412,2,B009AMAJBO,"Like so many others, I thought this show had a great premise. The first half of the season was fairly good--good character development and reasonably good stories. By the time they wrapped up the Save-Danny-From-Monroe storyline it went rapidly downhill. Every episode was about war and battles. There were fewer meaningful flashbacks. The characters got even more shallow. The developments with Neville were pretty silly. Pretty much every guest star dies sooner or later.  I started by watching 2 or 3 episodes at a time, but by halfway through the season, it was a chore to get through each episode. They were pretty painful to sit through.  I doubt I will watch second season.",1410652800,,680,4.956140350877193

5300420,3,B009AMAJBO,"If you're looking for a realistic post-apocalyptic show, this isn't it. This post-apocalyptic world is always warm and sunny, the characters wear cool clothes and have cool weapons, their skin and hair are always perfect and clean, the bad guys are really evil, the good guys are really good, and you've got a stereotypical team of heroes consisting of the Teen Firecracker Fearless Farm Girl, the Fat Smart Geek, the Sad Mom Who Was At The Wrong Place At The Wrong Time, the Mysterious Handsome Stranger, the Rebel Femme Fatale, and the Obligatory Morally Ambiguous Lone Wolf. And they're fighting against an all-powerful Evil Empire (Militia) headed by the Power-Hungry Psychopath. This show isn't even science-fiction, but more of a science-fantasy, and for all its lack of realism and cliches, I found it to be extremely entertaining. It never claims to be anything more than what it is, and never takes itself too seriously, and that's why I love it.

UPDATE: just watched the second (and final) season, and nearly threw the DVD against the wall. THIS is how you choose to end it, knowing this is your last season? Seriously, if I didn't know this was the ending, I'd have thought there was another two seasons of goodness ahead. Don't get me wrong, I still love the show, and the second season adds some much-needed complexity to the characters and grit to the world, but... but... but... to end a show with what amounts to a super-exciting cliffhanger is douchebaggery at its worst.",1408492800,,1489,4.862204724409449
5300491,5,B009AMAJBO,Revolution is really a very good science fiction action series.  Lets hope the TV company is NOT going to give up on it  before the is some kind of resolution to all the many questions it poses.  I took a while for it to get going ( Like LOST  the first season was so annoying  BUT BOY did it get better)  Revolution does the same  and once you get captured by it allure  you will be HOOKED.,1408147200,,391,3.987012987012987
5300492,3,B009AMAJBO,"When this show first came out, I loved it! It was exciting and a new twist on an apocalypse that didn't involve zombies (Walking Dead) or some sort of plague (Jeremiah). The story kept you interested and constantly wondering how all the electricity stopped working, even batteries didn't work any more. They give you bits and pieces via flashbacks that get you excited for more. In the second season though, the show started to fall short and then eventually just ended up falling flat on its face. It just got to be tedious to watch during the end, but I like to have closure so I kept watching, hoping for a decent ending to the series. Unfortunately, it appears the show was canceled before they were able to make an actual ending, so it ends on a cliffhanger. For me, if a show has a bad ending or gets left with no official ending, it ruins the whole series for me, no matter how much I loved it in the beginning.  If you're just looking for a post-apocalyptic, dystopian show to watch and don't care so much how it ends, then go for it. But if you're like me and have to have an adequate ending, then keep looking.",1407456000,,1120,4.358851674641149

5300560,4,B009AMAJBO,"This could have been as good as Walking Dead but it's just frustrating. People keep switching sides and not taking the advantage when they could to end the entire war with one bullet. I mean, come on people, you have several little countries to bring into play. Why keep chasing your tail writing about the same antagonist. Any fool can see that Tom Neville would make an excellent, and much more dangerous adversary, than Monroe.
Also the ""I'm gonna sacrifice myself for the good of all..."" is brought into play far too often. Bored with it after about the third time.
The best character is Charlie, she is the ""Darrel"" of this show but not as hardcore. Tracy Spiridakos is on my list of actors that I must watch now as she really brings this person to life.
Her mom (Elizabeth Mitchell) is exactly the same character she played on Lost. As in ""I got secrets and I'm not telling no matter how much it could help."" (I really hate her... not the actor, the character.)

5300713,1,B009AMAJBO,"The intro, explaining there had been a mass-dieoff, gave me the initial impression that the show would be interesting in that it would be unflinching in the implications of the show premise.  The premise of the show is that ""the grid"" goes down - in every respect.  The actual power grid but everything else from government functions to transportation.  The question ""what would that be like"" really IS interesting.

How wrong I was... as if to undo the grisly premise of the show, the shot that opens us into the new post blackout world shows a guy in a typical mcmansion on a cul-de-sac getting his coffee, going outside and saying howdy to the neighbors.  (where the #%&# is COFFEE coming from???  The only coffee grown in the USA comes from Hawaii - and your typical Mcmansion would probably KILL you in the winter or summer without energy inputs for HVAC)  As if middle class suburban life stayed sort of the same but got a new ""skin"" like if you downloaded a steampunk theme for your android.  The writers seem to have picked an incredibly INTERESTING premise for the show only to show no interest in it.

Aside from that, the show comes off as overbearingly derivative.  Chicks with ponytails and bows (hunger games is popular right, let's do something like that...), recreation of the scene from lost when charlie, kate, and jack go back to the airplane for the transceiver, recreation from the fight scene on the double staircase in the matrix sequel, obvious use of the same film locations as walking dead... (see walking dead season 2 episode 13 beside the dying fire)

I watched this show when it first aired but.... so many things came off as dumb and disjointed, so much lazy writing... I couldn't take it anymore and gave up after giving it a good chance through several episodes.",1397088000,14,1795,4.6847133757961785

5300779,2,B009AMAJBO,"I bought two episodes from the first season, and the biggest problem was that there was no voice track in the second episode -- the background was there, but we had to enable captions to follow the episode since the voices were cut out, after we attempted to restore the sound in various ways with no success.

More generally, the episodes we watched were something of a disappointment. The show has a great premise, and a lot could be done with it. Unfortunately, the characters and plot were both poorly developed and rather two-dimensional. The main character herself vacillates with the context, and seems to deliver whatever is necessary to move the plot along, even though there are places that are inconsistent.

There is also a lot of gratuitous violence. Given the premise of the series, this topic isn't something that can be avoided, but there is a lot of unnecessary justification for killing which seems to occur for no other reason than the amusement of the audience. This is true in particular of the main character's uncle. It's not a particularly healthy message.

After seeing the first two episodes, I won't be continuing. For anyone who's interested in this kind of series, I would recommend Jericho -- it's better written, better acted, and hopefully the sound will be there if you watch it.",1392854400,,1312,4.848214285714286

5300927,3,B009AMAJBO,Only mid way through first season and am a little bored already.. Characters are OK but not that convincing.

We don't like much of the ""b-grade"" Sci-Fi stuff, so I can say that this is a fairly high quality production.  If you liked X-Files or Fringe, then you're likely to enjoy at least the first season of this series.

5300967,4,B009AMAJBO,I enjoyed the series and the only reason I brought the DVD was to get the Revolution Pendant with Glowing center. I had already purchase the episode as they came available.  I was very disappointed about the Pendant as soon as I got it I took it to a dark room to see it glow it did not.  I have had other things like puzzles and posters that glow in the dark.  this did not.  It appears to glow in the daylight but not in a dark room.  I have brought other items like Marvel Averagers and the cube in the movie really do glow and I thought this pendant would do the same thing.  this is the only drawn back I have with this product.  The pendant has not a chain but something that looks like leather and it is long enough for me to just pull it over my head.  I like that becuase it is hard for me to close a clasp on a necklace.  The series is very good and I love the characters. I enjoyed the series very much.,1385942400,,914,3.9239130434782608
5300968,4,B009AMAJBO,"I had high expectations for Revolution due to the Abrams connection with the series....unfortunately the series start was disappointing from the story lines to the acting. Revolution had a great concept but the show felt like a cheesy version of Sci-Fi that we have seen too often in recent years.
No edge to the stories and half the characters were just not likeable - or bad in a good way.
Then it clicked. About half way thru the season the show started add some edge and maturity to the storyline and characters.
I actually was looking forward to seeing the show each week.
If you can tolerate the first half of the season then you will be rewarded. AND the second season currently running has gotten even better so catch up and enjoy the series.

5301080,1,B009AMAJBO,"It is similar to ""Lost"" where the outcome is unpredictable. That is not a problem but it becomes a problem when the twists and turns make no sense in the fictional world created.

The writers and actors of ""Revolution"" have done a great job of creating multi-faceted characters; you hate them, then like them, then hate them again. Like life, no one is perfect.

5301164,1,B009AMAJBO,"How J.J. Abrams can go from ""Fringe"" to this idiotic crap is completely beyond me.  So, it's something like 15 years after all electrical activity has gone ass over tea kettle and no one seems to wonder why anything on earth with two or more active neurons is still alive, since all brain activity is a functioning of electro-chemical processes. Okay, let's skip that one.  How about - why the hell are so many characters using muskets and bows and arrow?  A Thompson sub-machine gun; an M16; a .45 Automatic; a .50 caliber belt-fed machine gun; a bazooka; a mortar and and an old M101 Howitzers - not to mention their accompanying bullets and artillery shells  - don't need electricity. Yet everyone is running around with flintlocks, tinder boxes, hunting knives and tomahawks like they were all sucked into an alternate universe created by James Fenimore Cooper.

This has to be the dumbest show on TV.  It was a great concept and they could have done something extraordinary with it. I was hoping to see something that would grab my attention - like the first 15 minutes of episode 1 of the Walking Dead. Rick taking out the little girl walker at the gas station and later the Bicycle Girl.  That sealed the deal for me - I knew I was in the presence of something unique.

In Revolution, everyone is ridiculously clean, pressed and well-groomed. Charlie's hair and make-up are perfect, and since there doesn't seem to be any high-speed textile manufacturing anymore, where does she get her endless supply of stylish,cap-sleeve tee-shirts ...all in this season's ""must-have"" colors.  Obviously, there's a J.Crew or Anne Taylor distribution warehouse near by. Her uncle is an idiot and for a man who's responsible for standing up the most aggressive military force this side of ancient Sparta, he consistently make the worst strategic and tactical decisions imaginable. The characters are cartoons, the dialogue insipid, and the story lines are predictable, hackneyed and use more cliches than you can swing a cat at, or Carter has liver pills, or in a month of Sundays.

What a waste of a good idea. Plot holes galore. Not a lick of common sense on either side. A farming community preyed upon by patrols of marauding, heavily-armed bag guys.  The baddies are led by a diabolical leader, who is one character re-write away from wringing his hand,twirling his mustache and cackling with demonic glee, while tying some damsel in distress to railroad tracks.  Not one of our heroes thinks to post guards or build a watch tower? Really?  The most illiterate, lowest-ranking Roman Legionnaire knew to do that much to protect himself and his fellow soldiers. This thing makes Robot Chicken look like Lawrence of Arabia!

I gave up half way through the third episode. I couldn't care less about the characters, or the story line.  You know it's bad when you're hoping that all the main characters will kill each other off.  Then maybe, with a new batch of actors and writers they might come up with a decent idea or two.  Save your money. If you have Netflix, watch it there since you're already paying for the streaming service, or go find it online for free, or check your local public library if they have DVDs.  Personally, I wouldn't watch this is if they paid me, $19.95 to sit thru Season 1.",1382486400,14,3294,4.779541446208113

It has a nice variety of characters who can act, and what girl doesn't think Billy Burke is hot?  Loved him the Twilight series, even more now.

5301233,5,B009AMAJBO,"Revolution is a story about people. The over-arching theme is a world without power, but the main focus are the characters. Every single one of them is well developed and enjoyable to watch. Even Charlie who tends to get a bad rap from the fans is an detailed character and played expertly by Tracy Spiradakos. The characters banter back and forth makes the sometimes stationary plot seem to move on even if it isn't. The series does suffer from being in a singular overall story of going after Charlie's brother. The individual plot points are interesting as the group tries to save Danny. Many roadblocks pop up with extra emotional baggage for these characters. As they lean on each other they learn more about themselves and the ones they fight alongside.

The characters and their dialogue is well written, witty, and smart. The actors do a great job and every one of them feel very natural in their role. The relationship between Miles and Charlie is the highlight of the series and is perfection. Also the villains and their motives are well done and even understandable which is the staple of a great series. Every character even the villains are given flashbacks that show their life pre-blackout which gives them much more depth than normal characters on Network TV.

This series like JJ Abram's other forays into TV is rooted in mystery. Why did the world suddenly lose the ability to use power is the main mystery in the first season. Many of the questions that are asked in the first season are answered. That is right before a plethora of others are created to keep the second season humming.

The violence in the series is also a high point. Never does it become too gruesome, but it does have a realism that is refreshing in a network series. Miles cuts up guys left and right with that sword and it is always thrilling. The Blu ray itself looks amazing. It is near perfect HD quality with great facial detail and environmental depth. The sound gets the job done and keeps the dialogue crisp and clear. Overall I love the series and it's characters and am enjoying season 2.

This one does not have zombies or aliens but it does have lots and lots of white people.  ""Spoiler"" Some crazy white people made a super dooper soft bomb that killed the power all over the Earth.  Even though the whole Earth lost power all we see are the crazy white people in the tri state area.  The show never mentions any other place across the Earth.  Anyway there is this crazy white guy who loves this other white guy because they hay had sweet nazi love that was never gay and now the dark haired white nazi love guy does not like the blond nazi love guy so there is no love.  Just hate and the lack of power.

okay, busting aside I do really like the show but I care more about the minor characters and less about the main characters.  This may be because of writing, acting, I'm not sure.  I do care about the power thing even though it is totally impossible.  I fear that explaining the whole power thing will be a hot mess.

All electricity and mechanical equipment shut down all at once and it throws the world into the dark ages.  Physics go haywire and the bearded fat guy wakes-up after being dead for a couple of hours with no explanation.  It has action, mystery, drama, and romance.  It's a sci-fi show that really is a nice refreshing change from the overdone Star Trek wannabe space adventures.  I would give it 5 stars, but the creepy violent serial killer armies that kill people just for sport is way overdone.

It's characters speak in clich&eacute;s, opening dialogues with the usual ""what do you want me to say, Charlie?"" or ""if you need to talk"" or ""fill in your favorite invitation to inane dialogue here"". Charlie as just one example behaves so erratically, I feel bad for the poor actress whose task it is to try to make sense of it. She's alternately stridently self-righteous, inexplicably naive, disproportionately bitter, or stone cold hard-ass. Miles is as changeable and irresolute as a sophomore in high school. He makes basic, miliary errors in judgement almost every episode. This is the man who built Monroe's killer Militia?  REALLY?! Never mind the Irish Spring freshness of every character.

I like it, it's edgy, soap opera like, super clear HD, beautiful women with constantly combed and brushed hair regardless of circumstance.  And they are clearly outside much of the time, it wasn't all filmed inside.  And I liked Lost, so that's part of it.

And they messed up at least once, diesel engines would still run once you got them started, they don't need electricity to run.  Not modern computer computer controlled diesels but old ones would.  You could bump start an old truck and it would run.

Another big problem, when they turned the lights back on, there has to be something to make electricity.  Were the power plants instantly back on, I think it takes awhile to get a power plant back on line.",1377907200,,792,4.489510489510489
5301341,3,B009AMAJBO,"I will say that it's an interesting premise for a show, even if it feels a bit 'thin' at times. There is some solid acting, but I don't think we're winning any awards here. And I will admit, when I see the name J.J. Abrams, I'm a little reluctant to get too attached. The only character that disturbs me is 'Charlie.' If you watched 24, she's 'Kim.' If you watched Heroes, she's 'Claire.' Why is there always one who is out to prove that 'love' wins over reason and logic? And usually puts lives in jeopardy as a result. Don't get me wrong, I like love, but when I have a couple dozen automatic weapons raining on me, I'm not stopping to put a band-aid on your boyfriends' boo-boo. Eh, maybe it's just me.

The violence and the battles and fights are all reminiscent of westerns with the good guys and bad guys usually easy to tell apart.  Obviously the role women play is considerably different and the sci-fi plot twists definitely not standard western fare.  If you like shoot-outs and sword fights, you might see enough to make hanging through the other stuff worth it.

5301521,3,B009AMAJBO,"This was a promising story.  Good actors.  But, I personally would have liked to see how our heroes survived during the first days and weeks.  The story doesn't do that.  It jumps years I believe ahead and things have to be filled in with back stories.  My idea of a story is if you are going to tell it, start from the beginning.  Let us the reader get to know the good guys, their personalities, weakness and strengths and how they have what it takes to live in the new and brave world.  Then go to the new world and let's see our heroes deal with the villains accordingly. You can also do something similar for the bad guys as well.  Anyhow, I am purchasing this Summer's Season every week and waiting until the end of Summer so I can watch them though without interruption.  If it was something I really liked as in Dr. Who, there would be no waiting. and we would all be scrambling for the best seat to watch the show.",1374624000,14,923,4.228571428571429

5301593,4,B009AMAJBO,"Main storyline held up pretty well, however with the turn of each episode - more fragments were tossed into the mix - which in a way, had made the whole story more consolidated. Each villain was met with hatred for making the others suffer, but all in all, the actors behind the roles did an amazingly good job in making the audience detest them for all their villainy. Had really loved the ideas of episodic titles being tied in to a Led Zeppelin motif, also in a way, spinning the narrative of the story into a unique Zeppelinesque point of view, with the overall feeling of impending doom, Civil War-point of view and leaving each person or group to fight for his/her piece of turf. Last few episodes toward the end of the first episode, had been sort of a wandering point of view, not too sure, how far to take the current storyline, given the story twists that led somewhere short of left field, but at the very end, had loved the way all loose ends were indeed tied up, everyone meeting at the nuclear facility.

I did read the synopsis, but that does not compare to watching it. I am so glad I did. As fans of the show know, each episode is pivotal, volatile and the story is very fluid, all over the place and not entirely predictable.

However, I expect some logical  consistancy in my fantasy, and although Revolution does this fairly well, there are some glaring inconsistancies.  Come-on!  This country has enough bullets to last for a millinium of all- out war.  Muzzle loading muskets?  Really?  OK, the sword fights are cool ... perhaps throw in a few head- hunting immortals to go along with that?  Apparently the world without electricity will have an unlimited supply of hair conditioner and hair-styling will be more important than medicine.

Overall I'm fairly disappointed so far.  I keep hoping it will get better.  I might give season 2 a chance.
If poor dialogue and plot holes don't bother you, this is a good show - there's some good action in almost every episode, just enough of a plot twist here and there to keep it interesting, especially if you don't think critically and don't try to think ahead while you're watching.",1371254400,,603,4.375

This series is terrific, from the first seconds of the pilot to the final seconds of the season finale. I've always liked swordfighting, and there is plenty of it here. I also really love the sister/brother storyline, she takes care of him because he has asthma and he's her little brother. I also like that they never had a fight, from what we've seen in flashbacks and the brief moments that they're together in the pilot. Shame, though, that he dies one episode after Charlie finds him. Their reunion scene was way too brief. And isn't it odd that he never has an asthma attack while he's being led to Monroe? There's a lot of dust on the roads Monroe's men took, and yet it never affected him. I really loved the sibling aspect of the show, and that's why I'm talking about it so much, ut the rest of the show is interesting too. Will Charlie ever kill Monroe for murdering her brother? (True, he wasn't in the chopper that her brother shot down, but he ordered the attack that resulted in his death, so he is even more responsible for what happened).

5301992,5,B009AMAJBO,"I started the journey because I liked the strong characters and the way they were pulled into the story plot.  They had free will to leave the story line at many places and the choices they made determined their course of action; much like in real life.  So, it didn't take much to suspend reality to get into the story.  I liked that.

Because of the character development, you knew why each character did or does what they do.  Again, that's a plus.

I saw some very good character portrayal and in the long run that held my interest throughout the long season.

And finally, the last star came from the actual story line.  It is a story of what could happen when a crazy group of scientists take it upon themselves to reset humankind back to a time that ""seemed"" to be better without modern ""electricity"" and how we utterly depend on it.

(They would have done better to invent ""nanites"" that eat gunpowder and TNT.)

Swords were bloody enough.  There will always be Butchers in this world, for one reason or another.  It's a never ending trait of humanity.  But. without that evil to overcome, how do good guys get to prove they are really ""good"" with out-""butchering"" the bad guys reluctantly?",1370390400,,1198,4.542056074766355

5301999,3,B009AMAJBO,"Im giving it three stars instead of 4 mainly just because of the over use of action and violence.  I felt from the very first episode that it was just too much action oriented.  sure star trek/stargate etc had that too but not as much as this series does. i get it there in a battle and all but still.....and honestly i want more scenes of charecter interactions those are the best parts. the fighting. meh its ok...but i mean. the best parts are when you have the moments between charecters and such that progress the story and there just isn't quite as much as that.

the very first episode honestly i wanted to see more of what happend after the power went out. the flashbacks are cool but they are few and (more so in the later episodes) far and in between.  I'll keep watching it more because my girlfriend likes it (heh which is odd eh youd think it be the other way around) but yeah....and its a bit tough as they keep killing off charecters i know that happens sometimes but its hard to get attached to a charecter if he may end up getting killed.

the final episode this season was pretty good but honestly i think

[spoilers here:]  I think they turned the lights on way too soon. its only the first season.  the whole point of the series is surviving in a world without power and now that the power is back on (and also how does the power magically turn back on?  these power plants haven't been used in 15 years.. they have to be manned by actual people how was it that magically you flip the switch and now suddenly the power comes back on after 15 years you know?)

sorry to me thats just a huge thing....so great the powers back on and there going to nuke two of the cities great... so now what?  honestly im not really sure if i would have been that sad if this was the only season. honestly its kinda over in that sence.  the whole premise of the show is now gone.  powers back on..so what?  now they all going to nuke each other into oblivion?

i would have liked more charecter moments. more development that way....

its ok.  but think i still like the stargate series better!

not a show to watch with your family . and the thing is doesnt have much sex or anything like that (only one scene which didn't show much) and not much cursing. its just oh my god do they really have to have that much fighting?

5302232,1,B009AMAJBO,"There is so much that cold have gone right in this apocalyptic survival series, but sadly, nothing from the writers went right at all. The actors are all believable and pretty good. Too bad the writing isn't.

A good scifi book or movie should do at least two things well: (1) Be about science and (2) Explain any inconsistencies in that science and have believable fixes for those inconsistencies.

A good example of this is Star Trek where we have ""warp dive"" that can be thousands of times faster than the speed of light. Problem: Taking inertia into consideration, in order for humans to accelerate to light speed and not be squashed to death under the power of inertia, it would take something like 9 months of acceleration to light speed, never mind ""warp speed.""

So how did Star Trek fix this problem? ""Inertial Dampners."" We don't know how that would work in real life, but it is explained in the original series, and that was back in the mid 60s. A large stretch, but at least they tried to explain the possibility of humans traveling at higher than speeds of light, and they didn't stray from physics to explain it.

Enter Revolution. Somehow a group of scientist developed a way to make all electrical devices inoperable, unless you have the secret amulet, which is about the size of a walnut.

I've watched half of the season and there is no explanation how any device could be developed that would create a physics that would render electricity unusable worldwide. The writers just skipped that. I guess it was too much trouble to understand some simple 8th grade physics. But ok, I can go with that. I mean science is strange and the more advanced we get the more we see ""miracle"" science. So I can live with that to a degree.

However, what I cannot live with is the nonexistence of science as a method of story telling in a scifi series, book, movie, etc. I mean it's called a 'scifi' series. So, um, where is the technology and why isn't it being developed and explained to us over time? This is about the most science-less scifi series I have ever seen. It's more of a survival-soap opera series  than having to do about anything scientific.

Which brings me to my next problem, which is a disregard for science at all. In episode 6, I believe, the star group is walking through a subway tunnel to get to Philadelphia. They suffer a cave-in at the entrance to the cave, which blocks the outside air from getting into the subway. OK, lots of problems here but I can go with it.

A short time later, they begin to hallucinate because of a lack of oxygen.  Really? I guess the writers have never heard about cubic inches and how to calculate how much oxygen is in an area--THE SIZE OF THE PHILADELPHIA SUBWAY! Are you kidding me? We're suppose to believe that oxygen is rushing through this gigantic subway tunnel right before the cave-in and then a few hours later a small group of humans have used it all up? Do the math. There are literally thousands of cubic feet of oxygen in those tunnels. They would die of starvation before dying of oxygen deprivation. Wow, really? This is really a disdain for science in all ways.

There are all sorts of other smaller discrepancies, but I figure if the writers are going to be that lazy and even ignorant of science, they shouldn't be doing scifi movies in the first place, and since they are, and I'm watching it, there will be many more idiotic things like this, and I just can't go with it anymore. It's ridiculous.

Here are some problems, although less blatant than the oxygen thing.

(1) Nice hair and even lipstick. Yeah, right. 15 years after all power has gone off.

(2) Clean, pressed, shiny cloths. Get a clue from Walking Dead.

(3) Really stupid writing that has the actors doing unbelievably idiot things that no thinking person would do, simply to create a problem for a plot. Example: Carrying around a power amulet they know their arch enemy is trying to get, that they know is going to cause millions of people to die if it gets in the hands of the enemy, that is agreed by the group that it is probably the most dangerous thing they could ever carry--and yeah, it gets stolen by the bad guys. Wow, didn't see that coming. They could have at least hid it and offered it for ransom to get their buddy out of enemy territory, or something like that. Wait, that would take some good logical thinking skills to pull off in a believable way.

(5) Being more of a child's soap opera than anything scifi.

(6) The bad guys are obviously much more organized and smart than the good guys. The good guys are getting caught, escaping, caught, escaping multiple times throughout, even though they continue to (1) Have no tactical plan except free the good guy, kill the bad guy, (2) Make the same idiot mistakes that get them nearly killed or captured beforehand, and (3) Allowing a 15 year old girl to run the group, in spite of almost getting them killed more times than I can count--even though there is a skilled military tactical veteran in the group. Yeah, right. Ex: At one point they capture an enemy spy. They have him in cuffs and in a cage. In order to interrogate him, they take the cuffs off and take him out of the cage to a place where he can simply run away--which he does promptly. We're talking writing on about the 4th grade level here. It reminds me of ""Land of the Lost.""

(7) REALLY IMPORTANT: Completely ignoring the ethics behind the enemy, which is more powerful than any of the good guys or their rag tag groups fighting them, and continuously showing the viewers how psychopathy and sociopathology are rewarded, which at the same time never allowing a counter point to the ""might makes right"" militia morality. For instance, they enemy has yet to kill any one of importance--they always somehow miraculously get away, while killing off key people in the good guy group. There is no dialog about how the bad guys govern themselves compared to the good guys. There is never any retribution, although the bad guys continuously murder and torture the good guys. I mean this is an excellent opportunity to introduce some intellect into the series, but nothing. Not even a mention of the difference between universal might makes right morality and its consequences compared to a more compassionate morality and it's conclusion, which means the series is trying to grab your emotions without engaging your intellect.  Which leads me to number 8.

(8) The reason there isn't any thought provoking dialog about ethics, philosophy, science, morality is because the target audience wouldn't understand it. This series is written at about the 4th grade level and meant for kids between the ages of 6 and 12 or so, that is, very unquestioning kids.

The actors are all good, however, and they are doing the best they can with a stupid script. I mean when the boss tells you to use lipstick you use it, even though it's been 15 years since electricity was on.

Well, I can't do it anymore. It's a childishly written series for children and has nothing really to do with scifi at all. It's more like a kids soap opera. It's so predictable I almost fell a sleep watching it.",1369785600,26,7151,4.579029733959311

5302562,2,B009AMAJBO,"In the current glut of 'End Of The World' TV shows, Revolution is right at the bottom of the barrel. It tries to emulate what shows like The Walking Dead do successfully - the loneliness, the despair, the danger, the uncertainty of tomorrow - and completely misses the mark in every respect.

From the pilot onwards, there's an overwhelming sense that we've seen this all before. The characters are drawn from the 'pick any 5' NBC mix-and-match set and lack any depth or personality, to the point where the actors are practically phoning in their performances. As a result, it feels like everyone's playing a game of let's pretend than showing us a window into their post-apocalyptic reality. At least in similar shows, the actors are made to look dirty and worn down - here, everyone's just had a shower, spa treatment and fresh hair cut. I don't believe the world they're showing us.

There are some J.J.Abrams trademarks too that once drew intrigue but as we all got burned by the mysteries going nowhere in Lost, make me wonder if they are just to excite the audience rather than part of any larger over-arching plot. The most interesting part of the whole series was the initial scene where the electricity stopped working and it showed the transformation from today's world to Revolution's dystopia - again, Abrams is brilliant at creating clever 'what if' set ups but increasingly fails to deliver on the promise of the premise.

To be fair, the End Of The World genre is difficult to pull off because of the sheer number of shows on the topic and the high quality of execution in some cases. Still, in such a competitive field this is a pretty lame offering.",1368057600,6,1666,4.698630136986301

5302644,4,B009AMAJBO,"The show has been steadily improving IMHO. At the beginning it seemed like when the lights went out suddenly it was 1870. I am sure it would be easier to build a musket with forge and a lathe but the tech to build a AR-15 is nearly the same. That problem  holds true for many of the mechanical things in the show. However the story is well told and I was able to forget about the lack of engineers (really don't want to go to far with this complaint). I loved that the big reveal came in season one, kudos for not holding out on what caused the power failure. Now the writers are free to go boldly into..... guess we will just have to wait and see but I have high hopes. Not too high but the potential is there.
There is another problem that I feel I must address. I hate it when people give a show or product a bad rating because of shipping failure ect. you know what I mean. There were many problems watching this series. I did not make it through even one episode without having the feed stop for an extended loading period usually multiple times. I restarted more than once, maybe I was impatient but it was very aggravating. I checked multiple times to see if Netflix had this show to no avail. I am not sure what caused this problem. A streaming video I paid a premium above my yearly fee for should work better than this. I feel like I am paying to  see shows on my schedule without commercials. I am fine with that but not at all fine with the terrible feed. I hope someone at Amazon video will address this problem before I have to look elsewhere for content.",1367366400,,1569,4.19205298013245

It didn't seem to have its footing, and I had difficulty imagining how it would continue to prove interesting for five seasons (the magic number in Hollywood).  Well, I am glad that I was proven wrong.  As the show has progressed, the story lines have become deeper and the characters more fleshed out.  This show was created by Eric Kripke, who also created Supernatural.  I didn't care much for Supernatural at first, either, but it slowly became one of my favorite shows.  Each episode built upon the next, and the plot and characters were fleshed out over time.  People need to give this show a chance, and let it build its story.  A lot of series don't really find their direction until the second season.  Now, it seems, the networks cancel shows before they have a chance to develop.

What amazes me is how lame many of the choices are. In almost every scene, all the actors look like they just got out of the shower! Couldn't they at least throw a little dirt around their cheeks?

And no one has a bicycle, or a skateboard. Everyone walks everywhere, and gets there really fast.

So there's little attention to detail.

What they do very well is combine the music and the need for connection. Lots of sweet moments around the theme of love, sacrifice, connection. That's what keeps me coming back.",1367107200,2,745,4.656488549618321

I swore off watching anything touched by Abrams or Lindelof ever again after that.

But it's been a couple of years now, and I've been itching for my next fix.  (I can't quit you, Abrams!)  I think Revolution might be it.  Of course several of the actors/actresses in Revolution come form the Lost cast, but the similarities run deeper and are more satisfying.  The story unfolds through ""current"" (future) adventure, and flashbacks.  (No flash-sideways yet!)  The segues come complete with the subtle tension from the violin crescendo.  Oh, I'm Lost in this show already.  The story becomes deeper with every sidebar into a character's past.  You can't help but fall in love with each one - even the bad guys.  There's mystery and an ever-more-interesting and surprising unfolding of the plot.  Only in this case, the new questions to new answers ratio seems to be on roughly even keel.

I mean, electricity suddenly disappears overnight plunging the world into a merciless mosh pit of gangs, militias and war lords - sounds like a hell of a setting for a new post apocalyptic TV show right?

Well, after around ten minutes of watching the pilot (yes, it was that quick) I rapidly came to the conclusion the show had made some really crappy choices in terms of script writers and production. I call it ""being Terra Nova'd"".

What's being Terra Nova'd I hear you say? Well, being Terra Nova'd is when a production company takes a kick ass idea, gives it a load of cool special effects, when it casts a load of models to play the parts (with the one normal looking guy being the comic relief), when it makes the characters two dimensional with awful dialogue and when it makes the weekly story lines so horribly dull and generic they could bore a glass eye to sleep.

Some may remember that short run TV show Terra Nova? Well the above happened to that show (thus the term 'being Terra Nova'd') and the result was a boring mess of a TV show with no suspense and a cast who, although living a frontier style life, have immaculate clothes, hair and teeth. Oh, and it got canned straight away.

Which leads me neatly onto `Revolution'.

We have the kick ass idea for a concept: check.

We have the kick ass special effects: check

We have the cast that all look like models: check.

We have characters are two dimensional with awful dialogue: check

We have the horribly generic and tedious story lines: check

And we have a cast who, although living in a medieval style world wracked with conflict and brutality, all have immaculate clothes, hair and teeth: check.

You think they would have learned from past mistakes but no. No they haven't. I hate to compare `Revolution' to `Walking Dead' but needless to say, `Walking Dead' is, in my opinion, one of the best shows not only to be currently on TV but to have ever been on TV. And the reason for that is because it is the exact OPPOSITE of Revolution and, indeed, Terra Nova.

With Walking Dead, the viewer is invested with the character, there's a genuine air of menace which makes the viewer genuinely nervous when watching, the characters LOOK like they live in a post apocalyptic wasteland, the script is fantastic, the music is fantastic, the sets are fantastic, in fact EVERYthing is fantastic.

Unlike Revolution.

Very, very disappointed.

Of course all this is this TV fan's opinion but, as I see from all the other reviews that agree with me, I see I am far from alone...",1364601600,5,2630,4.589743589743589
5303075,5,B009AMAJBO,"First of all Eric Kripke is nothing short of amazing. If he is involved in a show it is worth watching. This one sort of reminds me of a cross between Jericho and the walking dead. (With out the nukes and zombies) I like that they mention the little things like seriously missing toilet paper. There are many subtle and some not so subtle movie/book references sprinkled through out. Some of the sarcastic comments can be quite funny.

Like the walking dead, they are not afraid to kill off your favorite character so you are never totally sure what they will do next.",1364601600,2,568,4.514563106796117
5303076,1,B009AMAJBO,"I guess I was desperate to get my science fiction fix and I started watching ""Revolution"".

The premise of this program is that someone has figured out a way to kill everything electric/electronic on
the planet and plunged the world back into the ""dark"" ages.

Two men who were in the military somehow rose to the top of a military group and took over part of what
used to be the United States, and then had a falling out because both were ruthless killers, but one saw
the error of his ways and retired.

The acting is as bad as the plot and the plot is ridiculous.  Not only that but I did not realize this has
some connection with JJ Abrams of ""Lost"" infamy ... not to mention ""Fringe"" ... the shows are probably
at the level of ages in the single digits.  There is really nothing wrong with that, but the stories are
lacking in any message or point, not to mention totally ridiculous that I could barely watch them.

Most of the main adult characters get bumped off in the first 20 minutes leaving the show to the angst ridden teen leads.
Good idea, spoiled by audience number preoccupation. The continuing infantilisation of entertainment. It may backfire in the long run though as many adults will be interested in the scenario.
JJ Abrams did the same thing to Star Trek. Transformed it from slightly camp SF with political heart of gold to slightly fascist, teen angst drama with no heart at all.
If you are over 30, and don't care about having no characters to identify with, you might enjoy it.

There are so many good books out there that deal with this genre in an interesting, realistic way, good books that portray the possibility of something like this happening in a way that doesn't seem so out there, and I don't know that these guys read many of them. I can't deal with the ""beautiful"" people, perfectly healthy and with no signs of malnutrition, in perfectly washed, brand new clothing when they're all dwelling in what looks like a feudal, agricultural society. I can't understand why, only after 15 years, the opening theme song shows a completely overgrown city. Nor can I even imagine that an airport field wouldn't have already been scavenged within fifteen years of such a tragic (emp?) attack for food and supplies. And I would love it if the ""rich"" guy could wear the necklace on his person rather than keep it in a sack that can easily be stolen. And let's not even go the acting...oh my god...I was so excited for this show...so excited...but it's just fallen flat. Jericho was better and even that show was plagued with poor acting and dialogue writing. Either way, I don't know if it's worth getting invested when it's obvious this show won't go past a season.

5303395,1,B009AMAJBO,"The idea I love. I love post-apocalyptic stories. I can ignore some of the unrealistic components of this show for the sake of FICTION writing. After all in a fiction world, the physics do not matter much. As others have pointed out it would be unlikely to ever occur this way in real life, but after all it is fiction.

My issue with this series is the writing. It is too cliche` with terrible actors. In one episode, the 18 year old boy (who acts more like a 12 year old boy) was being held captive and tormented by a 15 year old man. The 18 year old escapes briefly (he seems to cry a lot too) and is attacked by the 50 year old. There was some sort of collapse of the building they are in and the 18 year old hesitates as to whether or not to save the 50 year old man. The 50 year old has tormented the 18 year old, held him captive, and commands an army. Who in their right mind would save them... yet this show wants to take a morally repugnant ""high ground"" of all the good people are wholly good and constantly allow bad people to go and hurt them later(never mind the implications of allowing bad people to live in a post-apocalyptic world) and the 18 year old saves the 50 year old's life, WHY!? You see this throughout the show, it is ridiculous and all of the ""good"" characters are essentially the same when it comes to this. No one seems willing to fight or kill to save their own lives... really? No wonder that village at the beginning was so easily overtaken. At one point it shows the father, mother and young daughter. The daughter is being threatened physically by a man and the father can't shoot him, so his wife takes the gun and does it. Incidentally the wife is kind of bad as she basically works for the militia.
 At one point, during the 18 year old's crying sprees, he says to the 50 year old that was along the lines of, ""You are only a big man when you beat up on 18 year old kids."" What? That 18 year old should be at or near the peak of physical ability. He may not be able to beat up the 50 year old man to save his own life, but clearly the 50 year old is not beating on a 5 year old who can't defend himself. He is attacking an 18 year old who has had ample opportunity to kill the 50 year old an he balks every time; and then blames it on his age. What is wrong with the people who wrote this crap?

And then you have the girl. The worst actor in the show. She always has this look that makes me think the director is there saying, ""show me your mad face now. ugh, well you will work for next to nothing so I guess that will have to do.""
The show could be much better, but the acting and writing are terrible.",1358208000,6,2644,4.041984732824427

5303398,4,B009AMAJBO,"I may be a picker of nits but, hey, Amazon asked what I thought.

Revolutions is a fairly well written post-apocalyptic drama based on the mysterious end of all things electrical. Whatever happened flew in the face of physics and could not be undone by whoever had the intelligence to deal with such things. Among those who may or may not have had the ability to undo the damage is a man, his wife and two children, and the husband's brother. These five form the core of the ""good guys"" though the brother / uncle is ambiguous in his goodness / badness.

The story starts 15 years after the power went out so we're spared the escape from the downfall of society for the most part. There are plenty of other series / films whose focus is exactly that; if you're looking for how things fall apart watch ""The Walking Dead"" or others of that ilk.

We do get glimpses of the fall when the writers feel the need to explain the back story on some of the characters, particularly the bad guys and the ambiguous uncle. I rather like this treatment as it provides enough story but doesn't dwell on the seemingly necessary brutality. Again, if you're looking for that, see ""The Walking Dead.""

The acting is okay if not particularly strong or compelling. I'm a little distracted by the all too tidy clothing, hair, and beards of the cast; you'd think the end of civilization as we know it would mean dirty clothing, uncut hair, and untrimmed beards but you'd be wrong. I'm not expecting ""The Road"" level of filth but, come on, everything run on electricity stops and everyone somehow keeps their clothing clean, their hair fashionable, and their beards (of which there are few) neatly trimmed? It's a small but glaring problem for me.

I haven't finished the first season but probably will. Unless the story presents a more compelling reason to continue watching I doubt I'll continue to season 2.",1357948800,,1886,4.617910447761194

I mean, you're supposed to be someone who was raised in a hostile world where dog eats dog, and you're asking questions about why your uncle needs to take someone out??  The only thing that kept me watching was the way he looked at her as if she were the dumbest person on earth.
Also, the characters appear quite a bit too clean and polished for people eeking out an existence on the road. But I guess the producers felt a need to sanitize things for a television audience?
I will say however, the later episodes seem to correct these potentially fatal flaws.
I'll keep watching in the hopes that the series doesn't devolve into a superficial comic-esque soap opera. That would be an unfortunate thing to do to such a great premise.",1357516800,,1023,4.52972972972973

Can't wait for season 2!,1357516800,,353,4.086956521739131
5303493,3,B009AMAJBO,"I liked this series, however I was under the impression that it was based on the ""Change"" series by S.M. Sterling, so I thought it wild be a little truer to the books.  Once I realized otherwise, I looked at it from a new angle.  The story is decent, with a few holes here and there.  The cast is a pretty good one.  And I can't complain about the action.

I was a huge fan of ""Lost"" up until the last season,  so it will be interesting to see if JJ Abrams can wrap this one up neatly and leave his fans satisfied.

All in all this show is good not great.  I'll keep watching.",1357516800,,576,3.9478260869565216

The sets are well done and there is some decent acting here, mainly Billy Burke and to a lesser degree, Giancarlo Esposito (who I would rate higher except so far he's playing the same part he had in Breaking Bad). The rest of the cast is meh.....especially Tracy Spiridakos who is unconvincing in her part and is no Katniss Everdeen. Overall, I rate this show as entertaining but one that could have been much, much more.",1355356800,,476,4.546511627906977

5303635,2,B009AMAJBO,"I watched the first 3 episodes, hoping it would get better. It didn't. You would have to really be able to overlook the glaring lack of believability in order to enjoy this. Really, no one after the village goes looking for food, hunting, cooking eating, fishing? They run into Charlie's long lost uncle of 15 years in the town of Chicago, with the very first person they meet?
I could go on and on. Suffice to say, if they don't completely redo this to add credability, I don't see how it could possible last another season.",1355097600,,525,4.479166666666667
5303636,1,B009AMAJBO,"I didn't even finish the first episode. The scenarios simply were not believable and it was obvious that they were going to stretch out the mystery of the pendant for a long time. That gimmick wore thin on Lost and I didn't want to be strung along for episodes or seasons. Also, the way they depict the ""militia"" is right out of a government propaganda playbook.",1355011200,3,362,4.5

5303711,4,B009AMAJBO,"This show isn't as bad as people say,it is action-packed well filmed and unpredictable(at times). I liked the whole walk across the country to save the bro from evil militia premise and how the story unfolded over ten episodes and ended with an action packed cliffhanger. The show is not for everybody, basically your either going to love it or your going to hate it. The story line has a been-there before feel but works out nicely. The main character Charlie is annoying in the first episodes but picks up speed later on. Mile's is probably the most interesting character on the show and the other ones are just filler. If you like mindless action entertainment, this show is perfect for you. If your into shows such as(Mad men), you will most likely loath this show. But action junkies will love it.",1354838400,,802,4.654929577464789
5303712,1,B009AMAJBO,"The show is too unbelievable. Even with trying to suspend disbelief I was unable to get engrossed in this convoluted story. How is it, with so much time to tell a story on a television show, they can be so lazy as to completely disregard logic? At least TRY to get things to make a little sense. And the fact that the world is in this condition, but everyone has perfectly clean and pressed clothes bugs me too. If the story was good I could ignore these things, but since it isn't, I can not forgive this show for the crappiness it is. I watched the first four episodes, if it gets better please let me know and I'll give it a second chance.",1354838400,9,642,4.185483870967742
5303713,4,B009AMAJBO,"I like this series, and yet somehow it seems strangely familiar even though it seems unique.  I can't explain the apparent paradox in my thinking.  I will watch it through, but they should probably wrap it up in the next half of the season.",1354838400,,240,4.431818181818182

5303715,1,B009AMAJBO,"Great premise, but blatantly unrealistic. I watched half of the first episode and already there are too many unbelievable scenarios to list. Just one: why would you shoot an arrow at an attacker, in the dark, when the victim is right on the other side, possibly pulled close? OK, another: no young man who had survived the last 15 years would have pulled that stupid and impetuous stunt, facing down the armed militia with a crossbow ... OK, one more: the militia just waltzed into town, catching everyone by surprise? No lookouts watching for bandits?

5303824,2,B009AMAJBO,"I wanted to like this show so very much. The concept fascinates me. Unfortunately the execution is disastrous. There are numerous smaller problems, but I think the most significant is that this show ends up falling in the trap that so many network shows fall into, where they try to stretch out about a half season's worth of storytelling into 22 episodes. We end up with numerous episodes that could have been edited to 10 minutes and we'd lose nothing of value.

Even worse, this problem became more pronounced as the series moved along, which convinces me that they are struggling to come up with material to fill in a thin overall story plan. This is not a good thing, as the show is only a half season old at this point.

I'm convinced that this problem is one of the reasons that most critically acclaimed shows on TV have smaller seasons. I think the best thing that could happen to shows like this is for them to see reduced season size. Thirteen episodes seems ideal. Maybe they will try this with season 2, but I suspect they will have lost their audience by then, which is a shame.",1354665600,,1092,4.482412060301508
5303825,5,B009AMAJBO,The story line is intriguing and not predictable.  The characters are growing and becoming more cohesive yet their relationships remain precarious.  Mrs. Matheson turning on her colleague and friend was extremely shocking and seemed out of character for her.  I suppose it was realistic for the situation but thought it was too graphically portrayed.  I was disappointed in her selfish blood-is-thicker-than-water action and felt she could've come up with a more intelligent solution.  All the characters seem to be on the course to becoming just as bad Monroe.  In the end I would like to see Monroe and his 2nd in command get some psychiatric treatment because it seems such a shame that he and Miles had such an extreme falling out.  I love that Aaron is gaining more self-confidence.  Perhaps he will be reuinited with his wife.  I appreciate that there is very little foul language or sex.  I love that every character's contribution is valued.  I think the graphic violence is getting to be too often.  I would not think this show would be suitable to show anyone of an impressionable age who is not able to discern that violence is not an appropriate or commendable to solve problems.,1354665600,,1191,4.870646766169155
5303826,4,B009AMAJBO,"At first I had doubts about this show, but the story grew on me and got my interest. (I think there has been better shows that got cancelled) It covers the basic formula for a TV show, with a mysterious problem that effects everybody, good guys, bad guys, hot girl, family ties, put together in a way that keeps you coming back for more. Give it a try if you have not a seen it.",1354665600,,378,4.053333333333334

Great story, excellent actingmakes you think!  We cant wait for the new episodes!",1354665600,,237,4.85
5303888,4,B009AMAJBO,"Well the idea behind this story intrigued me in a lot of ways, basically the only reason I even attempted to watch it in its first season.  And its a highly intriguing premise.  What would I do if the power went out forever? At least that's what I sit and ponder during this show.

However, I am a bit sad.  JJ Abrams is great at what he does.  Lost I think a lot of us will admit was a highly intoxicating show.  However after watching this entire first season I've come to discover that after watching Lost, Abrams really no longer has any tricks up his sleeve.  Even worse this show is strangely identical to Lost.  Almost a deformed twin brother of the hit show.  The same flashbacks like they did in Lost, the same odd never knowing who a character really is plots.

Where Lost was unpredictable, Revolution has become well predictable.  The true mark of a creative genius isn't to change colors but keep the same design but to design something completely new and as awe inspiring as his last.  And with Revolution I have discovered Abrams just doesn't fit the bill, all he is doing is recycling a successful plot line, changing up the scenery and backstory and switching a few actors and names around and voila! New show.

With that rant out of the way, I do have admit I enjoyed this show.  The idea behind is enough to make me watch, and even though I'm annoyed with Abrams for using his old tricks from Lost, I do have to admit I'm anxiously awaiting to find out more about Clara and the guy that took her.  And highly excited to see what will happen now that the bad guy has his hands on electricity.

So here is to waiting for season two, hopefully Abrams will stop borrowing from Lost to make the show work.",1354579200,,1719,4.3584905660377355

For all that is holy someone shoot her!"" every time a gun is pointed at her. I now give three stars and am looking forward to season two.

Never giving up and not giving in to all the negativity surrounding us,  Charlie is determined to find her imprisoned brother and Aaron, Miles and Nora are committed to helping her and helping others along the way, no matter what.

5304095,3,B009AMAJBO,"It's always hard to top an opening scene like ""This is the end of the world as we know it,"" especially with planes falling out of the sky. Suspension of disbelief is easy enough to do in a pilot like this because you're expected to either a) find out about how it all happenned later on (hopefully in a fairly believable way) or b) follow a storyline that is good enough that you stop caring about the 'why' and just enjoy the story. I started losing hope in the 'good story' path when our heroine meets 'generic pretty boy' at the water stop. Complete with well groomed hair... Seriously? The apacolypse (for all intents and purposes) happenned and yet we are treated with a guy from a JC Penny fashion line-up (to paraphrase one of my favorite film reviewers, Mr. Plinkett). Bad enough that long hair can remain miraculously clean for the female characters. It was hard for me to continue watching after that. I must say the asthma afflicted brother and the fat nerd characters started to piss me off really early. The boy would never survive if his asthma attacks were as common and severe as they are portrayed in the pilot. The fat nerd would have become a much thinner nerd 15 years after the last Twinkie (and living in a small farming village). I know, they had to fit alot of introduction and story into a short time for the pilot, but if the series doesn't get more like Walking Dead serious and less Dark Angel without Dark Angel, I'll never make it through the first season. The heroine's uncle and the doctor are the promising guides to this path as both have demonstrated ruthless efficiency exactly as post-apacolypse survivors are expected to. If they can't carry the series, our heroine is going to have to learn from them quick and become more than the her character has been so far.",1353110400,4,1801,4.544615384615384
5304096,2,B009AMAJBO,"Yes i weep...Its hard to believe this comes from the efforts of mr. star trek, mr. lost and mr. iron man..however, look deeper and its not all so pretty, because its also produced by the likes of mr. terra nova and mr. V(which coulda been fantastic btw). That said, with all these ""producers"" in tow, Revolution has evened out to exactly what it could and will ever be, lazy and meh, but with a bigger budget.

Revolutions' biggest problem is not the writing, the average acting(by most) or its premise, its the execution. While the writing makes you yawn or pause to debate hitting stop or delete, the acting is pretty decent all around and the premise is appealingly simple. The ho-hum, uninspired, unrealistic execution however is Revolutions' downfall...unlike Falling Skies' inspired, yet not remotely perfect execution and semi-decent cast.

Now don't get me wrong, Falling skies execution is the only thing that sets it apart from Revolution. Its believability is wholly more convincing(yet uneven a bit too often) in its darkness, futility and grim-ish portrayal of people trying to survive an alien event. While Falling Skies equates on just about every other level of Revolution, it never suffers as woefully as Revolution when trying to convince us things are as bad as they're being portrayed. Well, at least i don't find myself constantly nitpicking freaking everything about Skies, that said falling skies pretty much sucks to, just in a different way.

...the ""how's"" of pretty much EVERY epsiode:
How, when and what do our travelers eat?(not Monroes folk)
How, when and where do they wash/dry their clothes? with what? Is there soap?
How and where are they carrying these assortments of always fresh clean new looking clothes?
How is Monroe's army getting all this material to create uniforms?
How is anyone heavy(chunky/fat/husky), for that matter not emaciated? Considering the sheer amount of walking/sweating, heat, daily swordplay, apparent lack of substantial food?
How is everyone so well groomed? Why does no one complain or look in need of...a tooth/hair brush, shaving, body odor, hair cuts, amazingly clean skin, nails, etc etc
How do they all seem so well honed in sword play?
How after 15 years do all the adults look the exact same as day one? Yes the years are kind on some, but all? No less in a world of no showers, heavy duty soap, creams, surgery, sun screen etc etc
How can anyone no less women travel alone apparently worry free so unscathed in this mostly lawless ""dangerous"" environment?
How can Monroes army enforce any rule of law? No less with their own troops? No less be taken seriously by others when there numbers seem limited?
How...forget it I have a 1000 more.

Point being, i can accept the many ""things"" one needs to accept to enjoy Walking Dead, Falling Skies, Breaking Bad, SOA and the like. What i cant accept is when they(producers/networks/directors) expect me to accept those ""things"" and then blatantly treat me like a fool and force me to overlook the blatant story arc ""things"" that could easily be fixed or better yet never have existed if not for the sheer laziness or perhaps arrogance of those that don't care whether or not I will question those ""things"". There is a reason why Walking Dead despite its meh season 2 continues to kill, its the detail. They care what we think, they care that we care and want to make and keep us happy, thats it. They play to the audience while not trying to get one over through laziness or overt cheapness or worse i don't care what youthinkness. They understand that we will turn on them in a minute and then its all over. They understand that we will comment, blog, review, badmouth and friggin strike if need be. LOST(by no means am i comparing to LOST) almost learned this lesson but took a step back and fixed there Season 3(4?) problems quick-fast, unlike Heroes who just pushed through hoping we wouldn't notice or were just so devoted we wouldn't care.

Networks, producers and directors need to respect the ""us"", not the reality show junkies, not the sitcom whores, not the I kinda watch it..when is it on..well its ok I guess..no no ill eventually watch it crowd; No, those of ""us"" who eagerly await the next new respectable offering, jumping onboard in its infancy with the full expectation of not being cheated, short changed or talked down to. Its bad enough our sheer numbers are no longer good enough to keep a show afloat regardless of its critical acclaim(Rubicon/Jericho) or its steadily increasing demographic share(Surface/Invasion/Last Resort) or pure fanfare(Firefly/Terminator series); yes we love tv and movies alike, we like our entertainment smart(a la HBO, AMC, FX, SHO) and we respect the efforts of those who truly make the effort to entertain...

...So start respecting ""us"" and maybe we'll return the favor more often...and you won't waste everyone's time, including your own, having to inevitably cancel 9.5 out of 10 shows every single freaking season.",1353110400,70,4984,4.906287069988138

5304120,2,B009AMAJBO,"I tried about 4 episodes, and just could not go on.  I suppose it would be difficult for someone to pull off a post apocalyptic story right now that can compare to the walking dead.  Granted the premise is much different.  The premise for this show, I actually think is really good.  I was very much looking forward to it.  It doesn't bother me that there is no explanation of the power being out.  It doesn't bother me that it may not be plausible.  Its everything else about this show that is just bad.  The acting is, for the most part, horrendous.  The female lead's brother, who has been in captivity, just makes me cringe every time he opens his mouth.
For a group of people fighting for survival in a true state of nature, they sure look clean and well groomed.  The dynamics of the group and social interaction is also way off.  I just can't believe people thrown into these conditions are going to behave the way they do in this show...like petulant children. Yes, there is going to be conflict, and yes people are going to be irrational, but this is just ridiculous.  Constantly threatening to go off on your own, by more than one character, and actually doing it at times...that I just can't believe.  Your best chance of survival is with a group.  I just could not find it in me to actually care at all about any of the characters.  The only semi likable one is the bad guy holding the boy captive.
Lastly, the twists and turns.  They feel so contrived that it is aggravating.
I love sci-fi.  I got into Lost, despite getting very weird toward the end, I suffered through it.  The lights need to go out on this show.  Maybe get some actors that have dirt on their clothes, and don't look like they just walked out of abercrombie and fitch",1352937600,5,1750,4.395638629283489

I love the way the concept as allowed the writers to explore social interactions and the implications to civilization as a whole that such a disaster would have.  I would also add that I have read many negative reviews that echo the same complaint about the implacability of this event regarding the physics. To those I would like to point out that this is ""science fiction"", not reality! This means that the writers have the license to delve into the fringe. If you don't like sci-fi, don't watch it! You certainly have no business giving a bad review to a sci-fi show simply because you can't get over the fact that it may violate certain laws of physics! Come on now...

I think the mix of action and character development is just about right with a healthy dose of mystery.

5304332,3,B009AMAJBO,"As others have mentioned, suspension of belief is really needed for this show.  The first (nerdy) criticism I have is around the fact that the show treats electricity as something man made and artificial. If that were true, our electrochemical brains would be short circuited as well by whatever, obviously man made artifact, caused the power to go out.  If we suspend belief on that, then there are several other critical elements to consider:

(1) ACTING - this is by far the weakest and biggest problem in the show.  Charlie is just not a very amiable nor absoring character so far (thru 5 episodes).  Tracy Spiradakos has not shown the ability to be genuine and convey the deep emotions through all the feelings needed for a protagonist in this role and a female one at that.  She is without a doubt, the weakest actor in the entire series.  That is a big indictment for this show.
(2) PLOT ARC - through 5 episodes, you kind of see what's coming.  Unlike J.J. Abrams other excellent TV Series, Lost, Revolution really telegraphs the plot to you way ahead... i.e ok, we gotta find these 12 charm USB necklaces... great... ho hum yawn.
(3) ANTAGONISTS - the primary focus so far of the baddies has been on beating up poor Danny Matheson.  Given that any dramatic series really is only as good as its antagonists, this is another glaring weakness.

I'm hopeful that the show will correct these weakness but don't have a lot of hope so far...",1350950400,4,1443,4.623529411764705
5304333,3,B009AMAJBO,"I have watched them all and all I can say is they kept me just interested enough to do so until now. Before, I could find some amusing elements but now I can't get around Charlie's overwrought expressions that just don't come off as natural. As a key character, it is a shame she is the weakest link. Even the bespectacled millionaire tech guru is a more fleshy character and he is only a supporting role. (I keep wondering where he has been getting his glasses for 15 years!) I was actually afraid they were fixing to kill off another good one in this episode and was puzzled that it took 15 years to put a steam locomotive into play.

There are quite a few ""saw that coming"" moments, but also a quite a few unexpected twists and turns. Lots of action and high production values. Reminds me a bit of The Postman in it's light hearted post-apocalyptic style and tone. This is a good ""teenagers in the family"" type show to watch on a regular basis. One of my favorite things about this show is the haphazardness of the characters. When entering Future Chicago, a small fight breaks out on the street and the lead character Charlie is knocked to the ground, but without any fanfare. Like it was something that just happened. This kind of detail make a more believable show out of an almost unbelievable premise. We are eager to see how this show plays out.",1350777600,6,834,4.680272108843537

So far I have been pleased with the direction the show has taken with the addition of new characters and the removal of other characters. I do like the reality of the lack of modern weapons, and the return to pre-industrial society. While some post apocalyptic writers have imagined such a society as some kind of agrarian nirvana, the Revolution correctly imagines that such life will be short, brutal and full of hard work. People lacking skills to survive in such world such as lawyers, philosophers and other ""eaters"" (I.E. - people who consume food but have no worthwhile skills) are going to die quickly.

This third episode is still dragging along. The only TV shows I enjoy watching are high action with a plot line that is intriguing and moves along. This third episode has so many flashbacks to help define the characters that it ruins the presentation of the story. It makes the episode choppy and it therefore has difficulty bringing across the storyline in an interesting and flowing style. It is OK to use flashbacks and swap between characters in different locations but not every 2 minutes.

5304352,2,B009AMAJBO,"I actually rarely watch TV. There are a few shows I will catch if there is nothing to do and the only time I really watch is on the Elliptical on my Kindle Fire. This show got a lot of hype and it is a Eric Kripke show. JJ Abrams (or however you spell it) has never been my favorite guy but I am a huge fan of Kripke. I loved Supernatural when it started and I was so hoping the quality of this show would be equal to or greater than that one. Not. Even. Close.

Dull lifeless characters who are not only boring but annoying make this all but un-watchable. Whoever cast the lead teen girl roll should be fired. She is awful. I cannot recollect the last time I saw this bad of acting. Oh wait - it was at my daughter's 8th grade drama production. The sidekicks (who are so memorable I never remember their names) are lame. You get the sense there is back story and it does finally start to come through (I've watched through 4 episodes) but it is too late and too little to make me care. Since it is fiction TV I was willing to just ignore all the science behind what happened - and take it on faith - if the plot moved me along and gave me enjoyment.

I find it very similar to Lost. However at least Lost gave us a season or two of great acting, interesting story with a little mystery, before it turned into a confused mess. I'll be honest I don't want to invest several years into a TV show. I want to turn on the TV and enjoy the show and what happens and not have five thousand unanswered questions every episode. I find it irritating not addicting.

I will say Miles character has great potential - the bad good guy - and you can sort of see his shading but every time you think you are going to get more it's like someone yelled ""cut"" and that was all she wrote. Thanks but no thanks. I didn't hate it but I don't like it. Biggest disappointment in TV Land I've had for a while.

5304353,2,B009AMAJBO,"""Revolution"" is horrendous for so many reasons. Kind of like ""The Event"" and ""The Cape"", only those shows had better premises and bigger stars. This show's only REAL drawing point is establishing questions to ""hook"" the viewer in for next week. However, it raises more questions than it ever answers, which is a gamble even for shows with GOOD writing and characters, which this lacks.

""Why doesn't the element of electricity work, at all? No solar or wind or hydro power. No ability to rub a carpet and create a spark with a balloon? Why do the militia use old guns, from the pre-Revolutionary war? Guns have nothing to do with electricity, and there are literally hundreds of thousands of modern guns in America right NOW. And HOW does no one in America have guns anymore, but they all have crossbows and swords? (At least, they could've gave us a lazy explanation, like the Militia has bigger guns or more bullets, or people ran out of bullets or something.) Why don't bicycles exist? Everyone uses horses, as if bikes aren't an option. Why is everyone so clean and attractive? And not just themselves, but their clothes, too? Most of the young post-Apocalyptic survivors look better in a world with no electricity or running water than people do in the real world with both. Not even so much as a scar or gritty work hands. Where is our Katniss clone, Charlie, getting all this shampoo, soap, makeup, and stain-free clothing from? How could the government so easily collapse? You'd think, in times of crisis, they'd become MORE powerful and controlling.""

None of these questions are ever answered or even brought up. Plus, just like the worse flaw of ""The Event,"" there are NO likable characters. The obnoxious little brother who gets his dad killed and thinks he can do whatever he wants is the worst one, yet. He's just such an obnoxious teenager, yet he's supposed to be a guy we root for 'just because.' The militia general (played by Giancarlo Esposito) is the only character with any depth, unlike the Hero Girl who, like her brother, is too stupid and disobedient to believably survive this world. Or the ""badass for badass sakes"" generic anti-hero, Uncle Miles. The former Technology mogul WOULD be the only other interesting character, if the show ever bothered to give him a backstory. The problem with all the characters and lack of character development is, the show just sort of tells you ""These are the good guys. Root for them. These are the bad guys. Boo them"" without ever really giving us any reason to. At least Miles has a backstory of being a Marine, but we're supposed to honestly believe Charlie is such a great heroine, when she's dumb enough to disobey her father like a bratty teenager in a dangerous post-apocalyptic world full of looters and militia, and then, gets all surprised when he's killed in said world? No. She's the least believable heroine or protagonist I've seen in a long time, and actually makes you want to side with the militia, more.

I know this is a long rant, but out of all the Fall 2012 shows, this and ""The Mindy Project"" are the only ones I hate the least to keep watching. But still, ""Revolution"" is just so amateurish, with unlikable characters and a premise that gets dumber by the week, it makes me sad to think NBC intentionally puts crap like this on their network over shows like ""Community"" and ""Harry's Law."" And while ""The Cape"" was 'So Bad, It's Kinda Good' in it's writing, while also featuring well known stars, and ""The Event"" had a more compelling premise (but also, no likable characters), and ""Terra Nova"" on FOX also had a better premise and much more Sci Fi to it, ""Revolution"" has none of these things and the only literal reason to keep watching is because it's on TV. And well, Monday nights kinda suck anyway, with mostly only Reality Shows aimed at women over 30.

But, yeah. Revolution is worse than all the big Epic shows before it. But NBC isn't exactly laissez faire with their viewers. They'll continue to put out crap, almost with the intention of torturing it's ever-decreasing watchers. ""The Office"" has jumped the shark ever since Carell left and ""30 Rock"" and ""Community"" are almost dead. That just leaves 'SVU' and ""Grimm"" as NBC's only good shows left after the 2012-2013 TV season. Unless they accidentally stumble upon another good show, like ""Grimm."" But it's unlikely. ""Revolution"" will be gone before you know it, like Terra Nova and The Event, so ""enjoy"" it while it lasts, even if it is sucktastic.",1350259200,22,4500,4.721374045801527

It did have a thought provoking scene that spoke to the love affair we have with our gadgets. It made it clear how we could end up empty handed and brokenhearted because they have taken the place of the more traditional means of keeping our personal history.

I have to guess that it is all of the other solidly portrayed characters that keep me watching even though the lights out scenario makes no scientific sense.

I'll try another episode or two if they were free (I watch all TV and movies via streaming video, not cable), but I wouldn't waste money on subscribing to the series, judging by the pilot.

They should be paying royalties to them, but ideas can't be copyrighted, and they're just taking bits from each show. The premise is intriguing, so too bad if they're going to waste it.

very interesting idea, 16 years after everything electronic in the world mysteriously stops working. The world becomes almost medievil with guns and is run by malitia.
Tracy Spiridakos in the lead roll of Charlie is the real highlight to the show, she is indeed stunning. Charlie is on a quest to save her brother who has been taken captive by the malitia and gains the reluctant help from her long lost uncle Miles.
At times the story can get a little cheesy, especially some of the sword fights, but it is only the first season and most sci fi shows don't tend to find their feet until the 2nd series and this show has plenty of potential and has cult following written all over it.
At the very least for the male population Tracy Spiridakos is captivating enough to give this show a go, fingers crossed it blossoms into its full potential",1350000000,,846,4.5359477124183005
5304400,4,B009AMAJBO,Excellent acting and great sets combine with a strong storyline to produce great entertainment.  Hope the rest of the series is able to maintain the level of the first episode.,1350000000,,176,4.866666666666666
5304401,4,B009AMAJBO,"First off, this show is watchable. I like the characters, particularly , teenage crossbow warrior Charlie (the Katniss clone), and former Google mogul Aaron, who often plays the comic relief. There are characters here you can certainly root for. They've lost everything. Charlie just wants to get her family back. She's lost everyone: her mother, her father, and her brother. Her mother gave the responsibility of looking after her younger brother, who suffers from asthma, and so she'll do anything to rescue him. Aaron wants to help her, but mostly he wants to restore the power. As he points out in the episode ""Soul Train,"" in our electronic world, he had power over his own life and didn't have to worry about schoolyard bullies, but now the bullies are in charge. These are characters you can identify with and root for, which is the best thing the show has going for it.

Now let's get to the problems with this show and why I think it has the potential to be  just another huge disappointment--or possibly something great.

I think the potential for awful is clear. If there's one thing I hate, it's a story where too much is hidden from the audience. That's all that Lost was, a ginormous ball of possibilities that made the audience unable to figure out, well, anything. You couldn't even tell what the show was about. And even when it was over, audiences were left scratching their heads. J.J. Abrams, the creator of Lost, has a hand in this show. What if he's just going to pull the same stunt again?

But J.J. Abrams also gave us the wonderful Star Trek, for lack of a better word, remix, and this is where the potential for something great comes in. If this series gels into something similar to Star Trek, it does have the potential for greatness.

But how exactly can it do that?

We already know it's not by turning this into a true science-fiction series, like Star Trek, one where everything in it can be scientifically explained. The science here is rubbish. As others have pointed out, the only way to stop all electrical devices at once and to prevent them from working again would require a catastrophe so great that it would wipe out the human race. There's no condition under which all cars, batteries, water power, wind power, solar power, and so on would stop and people would still be alive and unharmed. That's just not scientifically possible.

However, it's not the science that makes Star Trek amazing; it's the characters and how they work together as a team. It's the same thing that makes the new Avengers movie great. Who cares if Thor is a Norse god and the Hulk got super-strength from radiation, both of which are impossible? If you get great characters working together for a great cause--and you throw in lots of humor and excitement--you will have the makings of a great series.

I'm writing this review after viewing the first four episodes. Time will tell if the makers of this series do the smart thing and make this more like Star Trek and less like Lost.

How can they do that?

They can stop hiding information from the audience. Pick a premise (maybe it's magic or alien technology that's causing all electricity to stop working), let your audience know what your premise is, put all your good guys on the same side working together for a common cause (remove the moral ambiguity, which only prevents the audience from caring about your characters, a huge no-no), throw in lots of humor, and you will have a great show.

Otherwise, you're just wasting out time. Again.

The choice is yours, J.J. Abrams and company. I hope you make the right one for the show's sake, as well as ours.",1349827200,3,3632,4.648985959438377
5304402,1,B009AMAJBO,"There are a great deal of things wrong with this show, both in format and in plot. So I think I should first start explaining the plot before going further.

The story takes place in a future all power mysteriously vanishes from batteries to anything that uses any form of electricity. Before our mysterious blackout occurs, a scientist (who is the short lived father of the show's protagonist) who seems aware of what is happening frantically downloads something (we are not sure what) onto a mysterious USB flashdrive just in time before its lights out once and for all. We are then forwarded to a narration explaining this blackout happens worldwide and people are not sure why. Government as society knows it collapses and in it's wake rises militaristic factions. Fifteen years pass and bring you to the setting which the story will take place from henceforth.

 One local militia pays a visit to a local neighborhood of farmers which the aforementioned scientist resides in. This militia wants the scientist to come with them not bothering to explain why. His son puts up a fight, chaos happens briefly, and scientist is shot. A pity too he could have explained everything to the characters what ""mysteries"" this show is going to try carrot stringing the audience into following. Upset the lackey militia stooges have no scientist to bring, they take the son instead. This upsets our protagonist the scientist's daughter Charlotte into going after the faction and getting her brother back. Joining her are two side character's are Maggie; a doctor who was romantically involved with the scientist, and Aaron; A guy the scientist gave the mysterious usb flashdrive to moments before his death explaining to him not to let anyone know about it.

I must be honest here and say this is exactly where I stopped watching the show. Because honestly so many things were wrong with this show which ruined my interest in it. So if this a problem and you think I didn't give the show enough of a chance, I understand, but I saw enough to know exactly where they would go with this show, how they would drag it out, and having to think about plot holes so glaring and apparent I feel no reason to deal with them.

There are several apparent plot holes immediately noticeable in this show already. The first and immediate being the scientist. It is clear this man knows exactly what causes this blackout, probably why too. So why wouldn't he tell his family? especially if you knew the possibility of being wanted by people in power and want to keep that important flash drive safe. On that note what good is that flash drive if computers no longer work. When I said no power earlier. I seriously meant none. Zero. Nada. Apparently they can not even generate electricity from alternators. Of course I'm sure they will find something powered by a one line fixer, oh wait, I bet it will be a hidden city that does have power. And the writers will try really hard to make that a surprise I bet.

But the most rage inducing pot hole is they heavily imply this magic flash drive will tell them why the blackout happened and possibly how to turn it back on. Let this sink in for a moment. So at no time during a catastrophic blackout of a quite literal global proportion killing millions in the process, nor the fifteen years following of society collapsing and recovering into a military run government system of abuse did this guy figure hey maybe I should turn the lights back on. or you know at least give people the human decency of knowing why this happened.

If these problems are not a frustration to you, the narrative format of this show will. Ever since Lost showed up, TV Drama has tried time and time again to copy it. However all of these imitations fail to grasp what made Lost successful. Despite the many mysteries which frustrated many viewers, the characters were the priority and driving force of it's success. And while there were mysteries the series presented, these mysteries were not treated as the primary driving force of plot. The show was more about the characters trying to get of an island and survive doing their best maintain their morality, and putting their past obstacles aside and overcome each other and themselves. The mysteries were second in line. Of course the fans indeed obsessed over them.

So in the wake of Lost came Heroes. Initially folks boasted Heroes was better because it explained it's plots mysteries. While true, the mysteries were still second in line to characters and their developments. Heroes fell apart for this reason. Not because of a lack of answers in the plot mysteries. Something every other show after these two failed to grasp.

This is what Late night drama has been reduced to. Come up with a bizarre mystery, tie the answer to a fishing pole and have the characters chase after it, and don't worry about the plot holes. When it gets answered start over again. It saddens me so many shows try to match a phenomenon, only to keep following the wrong directions.",1349654400,23,5019,4.713797035347777
5304403,4,B009AMAJBO,"Stories that run in the genre are on my radar of late and this one advertised all through the Olympics and piqued my interest. I had lost all interest in anything NBC. Then it kind of took a hoaky turn with the lights off and some how working through a weird USB drive. Really?? I started to doubt it.

I awaited the pilot and was interested, but not sold. Now that I have seen 3 episodes, I am hooked. I like the stories that are going on and I love a good twist, so I am happy to always try to figure things out along the way. I enjoy the flash backs and the fillers of characters similar to how ""LOST"" worked and help you find the characters to like and which ones to hate.

Well, the scenario may not be real, but what I like is the what the characters face in figuring out that their imperfections and stupid choices do and how they all, like it or not, depend on each other. I have to say that Charlie is not my favorite character (how many faces can that girl make??) And Captain Nevell who was a worm in ABC's ""Once Upon A Time"" is quite a complex character here.

5304405,5,B009AMAJBO,"UPDATE: June, 2013 - Arguably the best season finale of any scripted show from the 2012-2013 season. Revolution had a very slow, bumpy start. After a several month break in the winter, it came back almost a completely different show. I nearly didn't pick it up again, but I sure am glad I did. The vision I had for this show that wasn't there in the fall, finally broke open in the second half of the year. IF YOU DROPPED REVOLUTION AFTER THE MISERABLE FALL SEASON, GO BACK AND WATCH THE ENTIRE SPRING SEASON!!! Each show was packed with action, exciting twists and turns, and the sort of excellence one would expect from Eric Kripke who wrote and was very involved in the first six seasons of the excellent Supernatural series on CW. The finale of Revolution was hair raising and the type where your jaw drops and you cannot wait for Season 2 to begin. WATCH REVOLUTION! IF YOU LOVE GREAT SCI FI, YOU WILL GET HOOKED. BEST COMEBACK BY A TV SHOW EVER!!

ORIGINAL POST - OCTOBER, 2012 - I had high hopes for Revolution. The commercials started in June and I could not wait to see it. To be fair, I've only seen three episodes to make a finished review and it CAN get better (ie: Falling Skies - miserable season 1 to outstanding, hair raising, honorable sci fi Season 2). I think the young Tracy Spriridakos is a questionable choice for our teenage heroine - she seems stiff and a bit unreal to sell this story to me. Billy Burke is the best part of this series, but so far, I'm just not seeing the necessary sparks between characters to make this show a true inspiration in any genre. Speaking of which, what genre is it again? It feels like a show that just can't figure out where it belongs. I read a review by one of my favorite USAToday reviewers and he said it was a combination between the much beloved Firefly and the truly wonderful Jericho. Well, it has a long way to go to develop the awesome ensemble of Jericho and the almost perfection of the best of sci fi and beautiful quirky humor of Firefly. What's worse, it's simply not as good as recent shows we never got to see finished as The Event (what WAS the EVENT, she asked, STILL wanting to know), Terra Nova (forever left wondering if the Sixers were good guys or bad guys) and Flash Forward (so jumbled, I'm not even sure what to pick as what I'm most confused about).

So, another apocalyptic ""thriller"" (still waiting for the thrills - I so genuinely use the in quotes sparingly) with the usual good guys/bad guys fighting for life scenario. It has been done and rejected far better as referenced above. But I am an ever hopeful sci fi geek so I'll continue to watch hoping (with fingers crossed) it won't get really good JUST before it gets cancelled, that the characters loosen up with each other and some humor is allowed to flourish (whereupon it gets cancelled) and the writers realize just what their story really is (which also might get it cancelled).

Or worst of all, everything starts to get really good in it, I fall in love with it, and it gets cancelled. There just might be a part of me holding back since I think I am getting a complex. If I continue to find this a sort of terrible mish mash of great cancelled sci fi - it will be a big hit for many years of enjoyment for the rest of you and my heart does not get broken again. UPDATE: If the show continues to improve as it did in the last episode, I will soon be a die-hard fan. Be afraid. Be very afraid.

UPDATE: APRIL, 2013 - So, the show just came back after a too long break and I almost didn't pick it up because I felt it wasn't as good as I like shows to be. Someone did their homework and these two episodes were like an entirely new show, and way better. The mother's and daughter's characters were especially advanced and worthy of those 4 stars I gave it to begin with. The level of action has been retooled and I found myself, for the first time since it's release, sitting on the edge of my seat throughout much of it. All of the characters appear to have been retooled as well. Let me just say - well done, Mr. Kripke! Having been a fan of Supernatural since he started it, FINALLY we are seeing some exciting sci fi that I expected but felt it lacked from the beginning.

THe show is great.  Billy Burke has the greatest swashbuckling sword scene I've ever seen--makes you want him as your bodyguard in a dark city street!  The characters are interesting and well played.  I particularly like the use of flashbacks to reveal how MIles got to be who and where he is.  (So far the only flashbacks have been about him and Charlie.)  The niece is kind of a whiny, self-righteous, liberal adolescent, but she has potential--she is learning to do what has to be done when faced with evil.  The pilot was great, the second episode good.  The third shows you a lot about Miles, which is interesting but there's still a touch of the modern trend in sci-fi fantasy---i.e. that the men are all flawed and the sharp mouthed self-righteous women must run the show.  We haven't seen enough of whom I thnk are the two most interesting (and possibly productive) women in the show---Rachel  and Maggie.  Of all the women, I like Maggie the best, she seems to be able to do what needs to be done without cutting down other people.  As a writer, I find MIles the most interesting and best character--and kind of hope he ends up with Maggie.

Don't want to give the plot away--watch the show on Amazon.  It is well crafted and even though we know scientifically that an EMP (or whatever it was) would not take out your cars, and that after fifteen years someone should have been able to figure out how to get the power on, but go with the ""willful suspension of disbelief.""  It is a fun show--may the Revolution succeed.  My bets are that ultimately Miles, and Charlie and Nora will become leaders of the rebels, as will Danny, who is nowhere near as helpless as Charlie thinks.",1349222400,2,1870,4.553892215568863

I do love the cast and I always give shows five episodes or so before I really make a chose on whether or not i like the character's chemistry just because of the fact that a lot of actors are just kind of put together and have to find out how they work together. The girl is kind of annoying. She keeps going on about finding Danny(her brother) and than the one time that Miles is like okay lets just go and then she's like no lets stay. : / ah okay, but i guess that's more an issue with the writer rather than the actor.

Is it any wonder that these newer channels now dominate all awards?  The short sitcom is about the only thing left which network still might make decently, such as MODERN FAMILY.

If you want to see what this series aspires to be, then go watch AMC's THE WALKING DEAD.  It is just about the same concept except that power stuff still can work if you can find someone to run it.  Zombies have made the world a post apocalypse society, not a power failure.  This is a small difference.  They are both survivalist shows.

This show had a good premise although probably the science is all off.  The premise is that we lose all power and have to learn to survive in a world without power.  That everyone looks healthy, well fed and well groomed in such a society is a big mistake.  The women especially look as if they could have just exited a top notch salon, complete with first rate colorist.

It appears that the country has lapsed into a military coup d'etat via the militia. There is a group of rebels.  There is also a small pack who wants to turn the power again, especially an uncle, Miles, and his niece.  It is this small band who are our chief heroes.

Gian Carlo Esposito, formerly Gus of Breaking Bad, is the head figure of the wandering militia.  He is again mostly the bad guy. It is not even close to his bad guy character on Breaking Bad.

I've watched two episodes of this.  I am not going to waste any more of my time on it.  compared to the its competition on the aforementioned other channels, it is at best second rate.",1348617600,5,1759,4.3734567901234565
5304495,4,B009AMAJBO,I would give the show 5 stars but the story does make some obvious mistakes. Some might find the mix of modern day firearms to crossbows and muskets strange but it is not at all. A good chemist can make black powder but a modern day brass cartridge round would be much more difficult. You must remember that the show skips from the time of the event when everything turned off to 15 years later. A very good example of what it would be like if the lights really went out is a book called one second after which is based on a real pentagon study on the effects of EMP. 70 to 90% of the people would die in the first year. 15 years later in the show you have the people that have adapted and learned to live. This is the only real point of contention. People would be a whole lot smarter in that situation. Communities would be armed and keep a watch. The ones that did not were the ones that would have died for their lack of for thought. That aside the writers have done a good job of getting most of the elements right. I will continue to watch as this show evolve. As is often the case a series gets better as it grows and this one has a pretty good start to grow from.,1348531200,3,1171,4.051724137931035

5304497,2,B009AMAJBO,"SPOILER ALERT (Episode 1)

With the realization that network television has to appeal to the common denominator, I still had a small hope that the writers would ""borrow"" from the works of say William R. Forstchen (One Second After), David Crawford (Lights Out) or even S. M. Stirling (Novel of Change Series). Unfortunately, what was actually produced was the aforementioned ""Hot Mess!""

1.) While we don't know the cause, I can't imagine that an event strong enough to take down everything electric and combustion engines and solar powered devices and batteries and make modern firearms useless, would not cause the lights to go out in a synchronized format? For example, how was it that when the Matheson household went dark, the power across the street didn't go till they walked out on their balcony? Same thing with the car lights going off when Miles broke down

2.) In that apparently the ""event"" also caused modern firearms to become ineffective (by virtue of the fact that most of the militia are either carrying muskets or cross bows and there is no conceivable way to claim scarcity after only 15-years), yet somehow the Captain of the militia has a functioning ""45?"" Perhaps this will be explained at some point in future episodes, though it is a glaring inconsistency

3.) Nice orderly crops growing, everyone appearing to be well fed with a brief moderators comment that ""millions had died!""

4.) Security. While there was evidence of a feeble looking wooden fence/gate surrounding the living area, it didn't appear that the crops were protected (no evidence of patrols) and there didn't seem too much thought given to creating a defensible perimeter. It was alluded to that they were ""under the protection"" of the Monroe Militia, though that didn't seem to include armed guards

5.) On the 2nd night out on their trip to Chicago, they make camp inside a plane, which is both highly visible and has a fair amount of open area surrounding it, yet they don't feel that it is necessary to post a watch? This is despite the constant warnings re: thieves, bandits et al

6.) We are supposed to believe that an attractive woman living by herself in a structure with no security features and with only a double barreled shot gun (another inconsistency) to protect herself, had not fallen victim to a predator?

I do understand that a TV serialized version of the road would likely be too morose for the mainstream, however, choosing to go with a combined concept of SyFy (a la Stirling) and an TEOTWAWKI scenario (a la Forstchen et al) is ambitious enough. Unfortunately, Revolution is rife with glaring omissions on both sides of the equations' for reasons that I can only guess are either a sacrifice for production or poor research.

I like the heavy set former Google millionaire that had ""$80-million in the bank"" when the lights went out and Charlie with her barely covering midriff shirts and nice ""bounce"" when she walks is attractive enough. Also, there was one pretty good (if not realistic) action sequence. I just don't believe that it is enough to hold true fans of the dueling genres and whether there will be enough casual interest for the series to last a full year.",1348444800,5,3189,4.826007326007326

5304500,3,B009AMAJBO,"Let me start this review by saying that I enjoyed the Pilot episode enough to purchase a pass on Amazon Instant Video for the entire season. The premise here is pretty simple: through some unknown mechanism, all electrical power becomes inoperative, apparently all over the world. America quickly collapses into near anarchy, with warlords establishing fiefdoms maintained by force and tyranny. The people live at an 18th century level, if that. It is not known why electrical power has stopped working, although there are hints that some technological cause lies at the root of it all.

Naturally, there are some inconsistencies in the pilot. First of all, somehow all the women in this new America all look like gorgeous Hollywood actresses. Well, they are, I guess. One might expect that the people would look more like actual 18th Century pioneers, i.e. wrinkled, not particularly clean, hard-bitten, but no. They all look like they just stepped out of a beauty salon. Well, most of us would rather watch a series full of gorgeous women, I suppose. That's what this is.

Setting aside the inconsistencies, the pilot has a solid storyline that held my interest and left me wanting more. I am hoping that this series lives up to its potential. RJB.",1348272000,,1250,4.947619047619048
5304501,4,B009AMAJBO,"You can never be sure from the pilot how good a show will be, but this one definitely shows promise.  Great premise...the power goes out all over the world.  Hope the show lives up to the promise of the pilot",1348185600,,208,4.175
5304502,3,B009AMAJBO,"First of all, this is an awesome premise... except for the major issue of physics not working anymore.  Here's a hint guys, if electricity (which is only the movement of electrons) no longer functions correctly then every living thing on the planet dies.  But aside from that...

The characters, so far, seem a bit wooden.  I allow for that, it's hard to introduce 5 major characters in just 43 minutes.  I can live with it.

I have two issues with this show and there is some potential saving here.  The first issue: is this going to be another mysterious MacGuffin show.  That's what happened to Lost and Alias and it drove me insane.  I don't mind strange artifacts or mysterious numbers, but give us some freaking closure.  SPOILER ALERT: These dratted USB drives that can circumvent the laws of physics (or put it right back the way it was) is kind of silly.

The second issue is the 'romance story' that I keep hearing about with regards to this show.  I don't mind a romance story, I even enjoy the occasional romantic comedy.  But this is the blasted end of the world.  I personally think it would be much more interesting to see how that little community survived those 15 years.  But there may be flashbacks, which could be interesting.  The issue I have with flashbacks, is that unless you have excellent writers and the whole series already worked out, then you run into continuity problems.  And that just makes me even madder.

This concept has so much potential.  What if there was an apocalypse?  Not necessarily zombies or meteor impact, but something that wasn't understood by everyone.  Just all of a sudden the world stopped.  What would people do?  That's a pretty interesting story and I hope we get some of it.

So, I give this 3 stars.  I'm willing to give it a shot just because of the premise, but I'm not going to sink years into this like Alias and Lost.",1348099200,61,1882,4.562874251497006

5304504,4,B009AMAJBO,"The world has been swept back in time with the electrical grid and all electronics blacking out all over the world. Fifteen years later, after the population stabilizes (e.g. the inevitable die off from accident, disease and social unrest) people are living in small farming communities patrolled by tyrannical militias. Our focus family is of course the family that knows more about the loss of electricity (at least in the case of the father) than anyone else.

On the day that puts the plot in motion, the militia shows up to take the father in for questioning. The son and the community fight the arrest resulting in a gun fight, the father dead (but not before handing off the thumb drive to a colleague and neighbor) the son arrested and the daughter and step-mother on the road in search of a long lost uncle to help them find out just what really happened.

A great concept for a post-apocalyptic and dystopic tale, but as many viewers have mentioned it just isn't working because the creators are too afraid to get really dirty and don't know whether this is an adventure tale and quest or whether it is a story about the importance of family. Not that it can't be both, but it is too aware of itself as a product of the moment with its scrubbed and healthy characters and its too easy movement from plot point to plot point. The show doesn't believe itself and that is why the viewers can't believe it. Other shows had things that were hard to swallow but were still good shows, for instance the lack of nuclear fall-out from literally dozens of bombs in Jericho, but the show believed in itself and allowed other hardship and grit to disturb the viewer. Revolution should be gritty and instead it is like Dawson's Creek goes to the apocalypse or the OC in the brave new world. I will be watching another couple of episodes in the hopes that it gets better as the post-apocalyptic is one of my favorite genres, but so far my hopes are not high.",1348099200,3,1954,4.53257790368272

Update: So I have actually continued to watch this series since I am interested in the story line.  So I still think it is pretty bad.  The acting by Billy Burke is horrible.  Perhaps it is the writers that are to blame.  Why is the only emotion he conveys is angry or annoyed?

After 15 years of no electricity, why are all the characters still wearing designer clothes and makeup?  Why do all the men look shaved in every scene?  Have the writers watched Lost or Walking Dead?  The Walking Dead characters look like they are starving and pretty smelly most of the time.  They actually look like they are suffering.  The Revolution characters look like they just walked over from makeup and wardrobe right on to the set, oh yes, this is just after a nice meal at craft services.

I devour fiction, especially fantasy and science fiction, which is why I bought this series. Revolution got a mention in my Invasion review, the only other 1 star sci-fi review I've given this year. ""Its even worse than Revolution (2012-2014), which is another one of those series you want to throw away after one viewing.""

My one sentence synopsis of Revolution is: Awful actors, playing awful characters, in unbelievable situations, in a series that's dumber than a box of rocks. One of the main characters, Miles Matheson, is the man who cannot die. Another invincible character is Rachel Matheson, who I wanted to see die so bad I kept screaming, ""Will somebody please kill Rachel Matheson?"" She survives miraculous escape after miraculous escape after . . .  Get the picture? Watching this series should be classified as a form of torture by the United Nations. The dvds and production values get an A. The characters, story and character arcs get a big, fat, ugly F. Why did this series last two seasons?

If you're looking for something better you might like a couple of space race shows. I spent a month on a space race binge. First I read Space by James A. Michener. Then I watched two movies, The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), and then two great series, From Earth to the Moon (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015). Theyre a great combination.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,2755,5.163677130044843

It was as if everything was reset back to settler days with the exception of a few people and places.",1514160000,,265,4.115384615384615
