8089907,4,B000BNX4IG,"This video, available online to Netflix subscribers, is - as a reviewer here and numerous reviewers at Netflix point out - a collection of newsreels from the pontificates of the popes of the twentieth century.  It is true that quality of these newsreels, characteristic of their times, falls far below modern standards.  Nonetheless, the clips are well chosen, and the narration provides very helpful commentery.  Despite its modest production quality, I would recommend this product as a very good overview of modern Pontiffs.",1277769600,6,527,5.325301204819277
8089908,1,B000BNX4IG,"I would recommend not purchasing this video.  It is nothing more than reproduced news footage of the 20th century Popes.  I actually might have enjoyed watching something like this, but the quality of the news footage is terrible.  Footage from the 50's, 60's, and 70's looks like footage from the 1910's; the quality is that bad.  Even the footage from the papacy of Pope John Paul is bad.  Aside from the poor product value, the video focuses largely on Pius XII to the detriment of other Popes.",1248739200,3,497,4.666666666666667
