They talk about how most people eat when they are unhappy, instead of when they are hungry. Lots of good information that you can explore more in depth in other areas. Very educational and highly recommended.",1279497600,3,360,4.625
7952227,5,B00005RFHS,"After you hit 35 you start to realize that you are either going under or you are going to fight like mad to stay young. I discovered anti aging a few years ago when I felt depressed and lethargic and thought I was dying. I literally felt that bad.

Then I discovered The Metabolic Plan and started to research health products and exercise routines. When Gary Null says you need less sleep, he is right. In fact, last night I didn't even sleep. OK, so that his not normal, but I have a lot of energy lately.

Would you love to live 122 years or more? It is not a fantasy. People probably can live a lot longer now and will in the near future. You just have to start taking care of those 100 Trillion cells with quality nutrition and things like green veggies and fresh fruits.

Gary Null tested his program and talks about fruit juices. I was taught to eat the whole fruit, not just the juice and that fructose is actually worse than sucrose. So, on that area, you decide. If you are going to drink fruit juices, make them yourself or find juices without a long list of additives. This DVD doesn't give specific information on how to make the drinks, but you can buy the cookbook.

There is some fascinating information about why cells stop making collagen and why heavy metals cause damage to DNA. I learned about drinking more watermelon juice and had no idea it was so healthy. Gary explains how eating fruit can repair damage and we also learn about ATP made in our cells and why this is important for all functions.

Gary Null also discusses how negative thoughts cause bad biochemistry and how you can literally kill yourself with your thoughts. This is in a section about toxic emotions.

If you have decided to wage war with time itself, then this DVD is a good start. It has lots of basic information and if you want to delve further there are many books to buy and I can highly recommend The Metabolic Plan. Gary discusses biological age vs. true age. I intend to grow younger. At least it is a worthy goal. Even adding one big salad to your daily diet and two or more fruits will help a lot and you will feel more energetic.
