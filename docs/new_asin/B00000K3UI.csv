7914330,4,B00000K3UI,"Shot in 1960 by the best French light comedy directors of that time (Christan-Jaque, Henri Verneuil, Ren Clair among others), Love and the Frenchwomen is a delightfully funny movie which follows the different stages in life of love, sexuality, and couple relationship.  Although directed in the early 60s, Love and the Frenchwomen is still strangely up to date and caustic.  The best part is of course the incredibly  amusing performance by Jean-Paul Belmondo in the short ""Adultery"" in which he plays the buoyant lover who would do and say anything to get his pray in his bed.  The part is all the more funny as you can hear the thoughts of the character in a voice off in which all tricks and low lies are being revealed.  Although unequal as all movies made as a patchwork of stories directed by different directors, Love and the Frenchwomen is nevertheless a very entertaining movie which will keep you thinking and smiling long after you watched it.",984614400,6,954,4.7926829268292686
