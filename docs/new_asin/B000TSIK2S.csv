8210811,1,B000TSIK2S,I was kink of curious what kind of movies were being released in the 70's--horror movie films.  Both of these movies were pretty bad--I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.,1206748800,,170,4.862068965517241
8210812,2,B000TSIK2S,"I loved the movies and they were exactly what I expected.  The only problem I have, and it's a big problem, is that the audio in Don't Answer the Phone was awful!!!  It was so muffled that it surpassed just being annoying and really hindered the experience.  I did like the movies, and I have to agree with the guy above that said these movies should have been on seperate DVD's.  I have other ""Welcome to Grindhouse"" DVD's and I can honestly say this is the first problem I have encontered in terms of quality.",1194739200,5,511,4.347368421052631
8210813,3,B000TSIK2S,"...and that movie is ""Don't answer the phone"". It is pure seventies and a really enjoyable Grindhouse flick. The movie is hilarious,the killer is one of the funniest figures ever seen on film. The violence isn't really there  and there are no real sex-scenes. At one moment in the movie the killer is about to make love to one of his victims that is supposed to be dead and we clearly see her naked breast moving (as in....breathing!!). The acting is hilarious from almost all the actors. I really had a good time with this little piece of trashy cinema.

The trailers are also very good (i opted to watch the ""grindhouse experience"", not the movies individually) and the intermission part excellent.

The second movie, ""Prime evil"", is a cheap eighties horror film with none of the charm that similar seventies movies had and shouldn't really have been in this disk.

Anyway based on this disk and the fun i had with ""Don't answer the phone"" and the general ""grindhouse experience"" i am more interested in buying more similar disks, but i will be certain that the movies included in them are not from the eighties but older.",1194652800,4,1125,4.666666666666667
