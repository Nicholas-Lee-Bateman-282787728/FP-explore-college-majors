The great thing about these old toons is they are well drawn and the scripts were well thought out. They are not full of predjudices, profanityn and violence. They will not scare a child out of his or hers childhood and do not promote gratuitios sex inuindos. They are just fun and silly cartoons nothing more.  It is hard to imagine that these classic toons from the 1940's were all drawn and painted by hand. They are beautifully created with glimspes of the then future in mind. The characters looked like penguins, rabbits, turtles & people  with a bit of imagination thrown in. The scripts were well written and the songs were just silly,yet fun to sing along with the bouncing ball. The scripts and the animation of these toons were not meant to be believed just to be enjoyed by all.
They didn't look like poorly created cookie cut outs from computers, which scare and distort. These old toons were just a little bits of goofy fun.
So just put away your violent video games and animated shows of today, dust off the old vcr and push in this tape and enjoy the evening free of filth and violence.
Grab this toon and other classic toons from Amazon. It's worth the change in your purse.",1315094400,,1279,4.532467532467533
