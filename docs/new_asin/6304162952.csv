La trama se desarrolla en un ambiente obscuro y tenebroso que te pondra los cabellos de punta y te mantendra en un estado de tension aun despues de que la pelicula haya terminado ( garantizado ).  No volveras a querer estar solo en la obsuridad...",1130630400,,376,4.597014925373134
8324204,5,6304162952,"You've got to see this movie. The horror scenes are fantastic. I first saw it when i was a kid, i was so scarred that i could not sleep at night. I think this is one of the best horror ""suspense"" movies ever produced. The four actresses are very good, specially Helena Rojo, she is so cute and a very good actress. It is a well done movie, well creative. You would not like to miss it. High five people.

8324205,4,6304162952,"This film deals with four young women who move into an old house inherited by one of them, and the supernatural incidents that occur to them after they move in, the film is well cast and uses suspense rather than gore to create an aura of doom, although it could have been better edited it is one of the better horror films to come out of Mexico. It was directed by Carlos Enrique Taboada, who also directed the great suspense horror film Hasta el viento tiene miedo(1967)and the more recent Very good thriller Veneno para las hadas (1984), and the lesser supernatural film El Libro de Piedra (1968). This film is an entertaining suspense horror film and will entertain most people.",1039824000,,682,4.644628099173554
