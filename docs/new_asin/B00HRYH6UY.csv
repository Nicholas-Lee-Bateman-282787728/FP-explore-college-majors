6201823,4,B00HRYH6UY,"The movie was well done and well acted but along the lines of a ""Hangover"" movie.  Some nudity and crude language.  Supposed to be somewhat romantic but a little misplaced",1394668800,,171,4.666666666666667
6201824,4,B00HRYH6UY,"Funny movie, the guy from one tree hill was a little annoying but he's easy on the eyes so that made up for it.",1393977600,,111,3.6666666666666665
6201825,4,B00HRYH6UY,"Honestly, I rented this movie because it had Chad Michael Murray in it. I love me some Chad. And he was amazing and didn't disappoint :) The movie was cute, but predictable. Just like every boy is in love with his girl best friend movie. I liked it and would watch it again.",1393545600,,274,4.188679245283019
6201826,2,B00HRYH6UY,"I love all of the actors in this movie so I was looking forward to seeing this... but it was pretty terrible. So terrible actually, that the only reason I didn't give it 1 star was because I like the actors, lol.",1393200000,,212,4.071428571428571
6201827,5,B00HRYH6UY,"1. It was full of nice faces
2. Although told from one POV it did well to show the four different plot lines
3. Characters were consistent
4. Didn't resort to cliches",1392681600,,166,4.21875
6201828,2,B00HRYH6UY,Boring. Plot was mediocre.  Sexual content over the top. Did not finish watching so the movie may have improved though I am doubtful. I am guessing a predictable ending,1392595200,,168,4.793103448275862
6201829,2,B00HRYH6UY,"There are parts to this movie that are really well written.  Unfortunately, it has all been done before. Save your time and money.",1392508800,,130,4.6521739130434785
6201830,5,B00HRYH6UY,Cavemen was awesome! Great story line and Skylar and Chad are always awesome. Made me want to move to LA,1392336000,,104,4.25
6201831,2,B00HRYH6UY,It was super predictable and not that funny. Not worth the money. Don't waste your time. I almost turned it off,1392249600,,111,4.333333333333333
6201832,5,B00HRYH6UY,Fun movie to watch. Some really good memorable one-liners. Definitely worth the watch and I would recommend it to others.,1391990400,,121,5.1

6201920,3,B00HRYH6UY,cute concept for a movie just a little slow,1425081600,,43,3.888888888888889
6201921,2,B00HRYH6UY,"It's an okay movie, nothing great, but if you like romantic comedies it's ok for a watch.",1424995200,,89,4.294117647058823
6201922,4,B00HRYH6UY,A touching story.,1419552000,,17,5.0
6201923,2,B00HRYH6UY,"This movie centers around  four young, long time friends who live in an L.A. apartment they have nicknamed the cave. It can be broken down not two nice guys and two total jerks. Chad Michael Murray portrays an egotistical, self obsessed actor whose main occupation in life is bragging about all the chicks he had banged and constantly prowling for more. This character is a living embodiment of the men are pigs credo. There is almost nothing appealing about the character but Chad does play it well.
The second jerk is a guy who has a serious girlfriend who lives in New York who he is supposed to be very committed to.
He often refers to her as his soul mate, and talks about good times they've had together and speaks of how special she is. That doesn't stop him from cheating on her constantly ,and actually having an L.A. girlfriend who has no idea about his first girl and sadly the New York GF has no idea about her.
The third friend is a nice guy who is in a tumultuous on -off relationship with his GF and that consumes his part of the film. I found the last character played by Skylar Austin to be the most interesting. His compelling search for true love makes his journey through the film a decent one. However, there were several graphic sex scenes with his sex buddy that I could have certainly done without. Camilla Belle was luminous and her character was very sweet, but this is not a film that I would watch again or that will stay with me.",1419120000,,1458,4.4
6201924,1,B00HRYH6UY,It only played the first 30 mins of the movie...it said perfect condition when I ordered it!,1414108800,,92,4.470588235294118

6201927,3,B00HRYH6UY,Was just OK.  Some funny scenes but story was not very good and many cliche moments.,1406332800,,84,4.25
6201928,5,B00HRYH6UY,good,1404691200,,4,4.0
6201949,3,B00HRYH6UY,"The pace was weird but it was overall an okay movie. And seeing the guy from One Tree Hill be a total ass/player was weird. I did like the song that plays when Skylar and his love interest dance, the part that plays in the trailer if you don't know. I wouldnt recommend the price it costs to rent/buy on here, maybe at a Redbox.",1404518400,,328,4.061538461538461

6201952,3,B00HRYH6UY,"4 guys sharing an apartment in L.A. The funny shots, the tales of the ladies, the deep abiding friendship these guys have for each other, the girl who is the friend but should be more. This movie had too much of some of it and not enough of the rest of it. 2 of the guys are basically scenery...why are they even there, Skylar Astin ""the Hero"", dear God does he whine. They do the best they can with these parts but the story flopped. The best and brightest spot in the whole movie....Chad Michael Murray as the unashamed letch. He is having fun and we can share in his fun but he isn't in it enough....just whiny guy and the girl who might get away. I don't know if I can recommend it, it has its moments. That is the best I can say.",1403049600,5,734,4.068965517241379
6201953,4,B00HRYH6UY,"--you will ike him in this movie, though there isn't much else about it that is memorable. Hope he gets some better parts soon.",1400457600,,127,4.333333333333333
6201954,5,B00HRYH6UY,"Once I finished watching Cavemen, it hit me that the movie has a perfect name -- not original or unheard of, but perfect. This honest and engaging film features an illuminating look at modern attitudes of some men toward women.

Cavemen examines the lives of four young men, who happen to be roommates in what appears to be a warehouse converted into a modern, cool -looking apartment, which is referred to as the cave. Two of these fellows  Jay (Chad Michael Murray) and Andre (Dayo Okeniki)  are womanizers, with Jay being the most prolific and loud. Pete (Kenny Wormald), on the other hand, has a girlfriend, but is confused. Dean (Skylar Astin), the main star, doesnt have a girlfriend, and is also confused.  Both Jay and Dean work as bartenders, in the same place as Tess (the irresistible Camilla Belle). Dean and Tess are good friends with no apparent love connection. So these are four guys enjoying life and trying to have either just sex or true love. It will all come to definition when these players throw a party once they are informed about being evicted from the good ol cave.

The movie is about an ensemble of men that want to party and enjoy life in the downtown part of Los Angeles, California. Women are just part of that fun, and their conversations about them are frank and at times funny, which make them, well, look like cavemen. It also features compromising scenes with nudity. I enjoyed the colorful cinematography by Nic Sadler, and it was nice to see sites known to me, like Little Tokyo, Santa Fe Avenue, and other places in the area. (USA, 2013, color, 87 min)

6201955,3,B00HRYH6UY,"An aspiring screen writer looking for love and inspiration  finds it in an unexpected place...(not!) He finds it in the guys he lives with and the girl they're all buddies with.

 Also it should be duly noted that at no point did Kenny Wormald get to bust a move ( what a tragic waste!) and his character is nothing like his two previous roles so if like me you were watching it because he was in it, you might be disappointed. There's no Tommy or Ren to be seen in this role.

But I'm getting off topic , the movie has its over all ironic funny moments and was an easy watch. It really kind of was a romantic comedy for the guys, which as I hate chick flick romantic comedies was a vast improvement:)",1396569600,,701,4.17037037037037

6201958,3,B00HRYH6UY,"I rented this movie because Skylar Astin (from pitch perfect) was in the movie. The storyline was ok with a good ending, but the character of Chad Michael Murray was a little over the top. If your a Skylar Astin fan who is an adult or have your patents permission (nudity) his character is pretty similar to his role in pitch perfect.",1394928000,2,334,4.403225806451613
