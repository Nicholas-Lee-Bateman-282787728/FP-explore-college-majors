8427674,5,B004EYT4N2,"Im surprised at how easy Mr. Brown transforms your guitar into a music box. No mumble jumble. Its all practice and to the point.

I have tried more than 20 guitar courses on different aspects and tunings, and this one stands above on top. Let me elaborate... This course is not long nor complete, its sort of an introduction to Open D. But its one that would inspire me to keep exploring my own guitar for pleasurable sounds. This is something I cant say about the other courses.

Here are the contents:
Part I 19 mins,4 secs
1. Introduction
2. Turning Your Guitar to Open D
3. Ascending Pattern
4. Ascending Descending Pattern
5. Double Stop Pattern
6. Travis Pattern

Part II 10 mins,29 secs
1. Introduction and review of Part I
2. Rhythm and Melody (Music Theory)
3. Ornamentation

Part III 26 mins,11 secs
1. Fretboard zones
2. Red Zone, Strings 1 & 3
3. Blue Zone, Strings 1 & 3
4 Yellow and Green Zones, Strings 1 & 3
5. Red and Blue Zones, Strings 3 & 4
6. Yellow and Green Zones, Strings 3 & 4
7. Red-Blue-Yellow-Green Zones, Strings 3 & 5

Part IV 26 mins,22 secs
1. Chord construction
2. Song compostition
3. Wrap up and Performance ""Through the Trees, a Unicorn""

I wish Mr. Brown would keep doing more videos and maybe put them in more platforms. He deserves way more exposure!!!
Open D + Awesome teacher = Magic
Thank you, Larry.",1466035200,,1342,4.391129032258065
8427675,4,B004EYT4N2,A great introduction to Open D tuning.  I gave it only 4 stars because there is no pdf to download and I had to pause the video and make many notes.,1412121600,,148,3.774193548387097
8427676,5,B004EYT4N2,"I'm really excited to have found this open tuning guitar lesson.
I'm in my mid fifties, had hit a plateau with my guitar playing years ago
and needed some inspiration. Larry is a terrific teacher and I love the visual
component showing the guitar neck with the colored notes.
I wish there was a downloadable chart with chord diagrams, I was constantly stopping the program
to draw my own diagrams. I'd also love to have learned at least one singable song in open tuning,
but all in all I think it's a well worth while program. Thanks and please do some more.

8427677,5,B004EYT4N2,"I went through the whole video in one day.  I used the instant video rental feature which worked great. I'll go back over it to focus on specific sections.  I agree with the other reviews,  that Larry is an excellent teacher. You don't come away having learned a song but more of a style of playing. His method of teaching you simple patterns and zones of the fretboard lets you come away from this video able to play up and down the full fretboard, changing chords and developing your own arrangements.

 No notes to print out with the video download as far as I can tell. There is usually at least a small amount of printed material when you purchase a DVD. A summary PDF would be nice.",1373241600,,688,4.34375
8427678,5,B004EYT4N2,"I started playing guitar again this year after not having touch it for around 10 years. Not a beginner but definitely very rusty
As a guitarist, Larry Allen Brown's style of playing appeals to me, he may not be Tommy Emmanuel but then there's only one Tommy Emmauuel and anyway, I've only got 10 fingers.

As a tutor this guy is ace. Dead clear explanations and demos - and a really great pace too. With each lesson I learned something even when I thought that I knew it already. So don't skip any lessons.

This is not a good guitarist making a DVD. This a good guitarist who is a good tutor making a DVD.",1361145600,3,606,4.260869565217392
8427679,5,B004EYT4N2,"Dear Larry,

I'm German, so I'm afraid to say something in a video review which might be seen by many people.

So, here we go: Your video for playing in open D tuning is amazing. It is both, a verny nice music video which makes fun to watch from the beginning until the end, and of course a real good training course to understand open D tuning and technique to perform beautifull music in open D.

More than I expected, a must have!

Yours
Martin.",1348963200,4,448,4.235294117647059
8427680,4,B004EYT4N2,"If you want to know something about Open D tuning on acoustic guitar, this video is worth a look. I consider myself to be an advanced beginner (just can't call myself ""intermediate"" yet, even though I've been a beginner for a while), and now that I know a lot of the basics, I have developed an interest in fingerstyle. I especially like most anything that doesn't require barre chords (my index finger is just too thin and boney to hold all the strings down effectively), and arrangements that don't require vocals (can't sing worth a hoot). I was reading about alternate tunings, looked for info on open D, and found this instructional video.  Larry does a pretty good job of explaining open D, and gives clear examples of finger placement for chords in this tuning, as well as instruction on picking patterns for the right hand.  I think I'll be able to apply what I learned from this video to make some very pretty sounds on my Seagull Coastline Folk guitar (love my guitar!).",1326672000,5,980,4.626436781609195
