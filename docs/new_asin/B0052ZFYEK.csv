4533307,5,B0052ZFYEK,"When I went to see the movie I had never heard of Russell Brand.  I loved this movie as much or more than the Dudley Moore version, which was one of my favorites.  Arthur's character was more likable and redeeming in this version.  Helen Mirren was awesome as usual.  Jennifer Garner is perfect as the status climbing girlfriend and Nick Nolte's casting as her protective father was perfect. This was very entertaining and easy to watch, nothing awkward, even the magnetic bed.  The soundtrack was wonderful too.  I purchased it right after seeing the movie and it is as easy to listen to as the movie is to watch.  Sometimes it's nice to just laugh.",1310256000,,650,4.6
4533308,3,B0052ZFYEK,"Short attention span summary:

1. Russell Brand does the best that he can do to fill Dudley Moore's shoes.  No longer a loveable slushy drunk, Arthur's now a wild boy child, throwing money around doing his best to ease the recession (and possibly share a few std's along the way).

2. Helen Mirren gets caught between the moon and New York City as she lovingly rolls her eyes at his antics and then makes it all better with a stern look and a snappy comment.

3. Greta Gerwig plays his first real love interest (not counting Helen Mirren's character,Hobson), an aspiring writer of children's books by night and an illegal tour guide by day. Her character, Naomi, turns his heart around, and next thing you know, he's closing down the town (or at least Grand Central Station)

4. His fiance Susan (Jennifer Garner), her dad (Nick Nolte) and his mom (Geraldine James) compete fiercely for the ""most unlikeable"" award. I know it's crazy, but it's true.

5. Bottom line is that this is an ""okay"" movie, barely nodding to its predecessor with one short burst of the melody of the original theme song, but at the end of it, you'll wake up way across town and find it's not still with you.

4533309,4,B0052ZFYEK,"I'm sorry to say that I liked the remake a little better than the classic 1981 version. This movie made me care more about the characters, and had more of an emotional storyline concerning one of the characters. Russell Brand was awesome and hilarious as Arthur Bach, a drunken millionaire who is being forced to marry against his will. Arthur is so loveable and very childish and is taken care of by his sweet but strict nanny, Hobson.

Because his mother is tired of his wreckless ways, Arthur is forced to marry Susan. He ends up meeting Naomi, and falls in love with her, but if he doesn't marry Susan, he will be cut off from all the money. I highly recommend ARTHUR!!!",1302566400,10,674,4.479674796747967
4533310,3,B0052ZFYEK,"When a movie officially gains Classic status by turning twenty, winning an Oscar (or actually being good) it's bound to be remade ... So the late Dudley Moore's beloved drunken shoes are filled by an equally pathetic and lovable Russell Brand as the billionaire who must marry a rich girl to keep his inheritance. Sir John Gielgud's iconic butler, replaced adequately by Helen Mirren as Arthur's babysitter/ surrogate and someone to play off of. The intro to Arthur's true love is suspiciously changed from tie-shoplifting, I think in light of Rehabbed-Celebs, and Liza Minnelli's hard-working waitress-actress-wannabe Linda, becomes Naomi, a self-proclaimed tour guide, played by Greta Gerwig, with dreams to write and illustrate a children's book. Same dilemma, Arthur must choose between Love and Money...Man-up  and choose= Love, becoming as penniless as Naomi or Money= marrying the rich girl he doesn't. Its clear, whether you've seen the original how things will end (She's HIS toad) but the film is cute, funny and sometimes moving. Mirren and Brand have a solid dynamic, perhaps more so than his love interest, Jennifer Garner does a great job as the greed-driven would be bride, funny as well. Overall, an ok movie, remake or not, not super, but for the pre-Summer wasteland...Wet sandwiches & no iced tea.

Although, must-see moment the Opening min. with Brand loading Utility-belt...comedy gold.",1302393600,7,1407,5.304932735426009
4533311,4,B0052ZFYEK,"Whenever a remake is released, comparisons to the original are inevitable. Most people tend to go for the original and remakes are rarely as well liked. The 2011 ""Arthur"" is a good movie though.
Brand is a comedic actor with unique talents but they fit this role like a glove. He is onscreen virtually every minute and it is on his shoulders this movie rests. His ""Arthur"" is a more a fun loving playboy than Dudley Moore's sloppy drunk and that is a good thing. No one could top John Gielgud's Oscar winning peformance as Hobson but Helen Mirren does a good job nonetheless. The rest of the movie is well cast although in the original, the father of Arthur's poor lover got off some of the funniest lines of the movie and here, he is mostly invisible.
I don't know that this is a better or worse movie than the 1981 original but it is an enjoyable film. Brand is funny and believable and his charms are just right for this version of ""Arthur"".",1302393600,35,944,4.4
4533312,4,B0052ZFYEK,"Upfront, I liked this movie, though apparently I was one of the only people who did. Perhaps I'm helped by not having seen the original movie. I grew up in the 1980's, and I was certainly aware of the movie. God knows I heard That Song everywhere. But I never actually got around to watching the film, even as an adult. This meant that I could view this movie for what it is rather than compare it.

And what it is was actually pretty good. Yes, it's perhaps a bit much to ask American movie audiences to sympathize with a drunken billionaire, but for me the story worked.

The movie tells the tale of Arthur Bach (Russell Brand), the previously mentioned drunken billionaire. His idea of a good time consists of drinking, dressing up as Batman, drinking, screwing every woman he can, drinking, spending money and drinking. He's attended to by Hobson (Helen Mirren), who does an excellent job in her role as his long suffering nanny. Arthur's mother, tired of his shenanigans, insists that he enter into an arranged marriage or give up his money. He's reluctantly willing until he meets a beautiful unlicensed tour guide, and begins to learn what love is all about, etc.

As I said, I really liked this film. It's not the best comedy ever, but I enjoyed it. Brand and Mirren worked well together and if the story was a bit predictable, that didn't really bother me too much. Arthur does get some genuine character development in the story, even if it's practically forced upon him, and that's enough of a rarity in modern comedy that it's worth comment.

It might have been wiser for the studio to do this in a way that had nothing to do with the Dudley Moore classic, but if you're like me and haven't seen that, or can just accept this movie on its own terms, I think you might be pleasantly surprised. I know I was.",1302307200,4,1818,4.5
4533313,5,B0052ZFYEK,I like Russell Brand. I heard this was a good movie so I took a chance and I bought it from Amazon com. I have to say I laughed throughout the whole movie just about.

4533343,5,B0052ZFYEK,"It took me 5 years to watch this movie. Basically It was Russell Brand sauing ""the movie could not match Duddley Moore's ""Arthur"". But I have always been fascinated by Russel honesty which sometimes takes a derailed look at life in general. The curse of Russell . OUT OF THE PARK IQ.
It is said other actors refuse to work with him because he is THAT good that he can improvise Shakespeare to suit a different flow. And in his ""Arthur"" he made a different movie 100% Different . As much as I LOVED Dudley Moore  there were entire caricatures and flippant  reparte:
Arthur: I'm going to take a bath.
Hobson: I'll alert the media.
Wast THAT ""really"" funny ? No it was not.
Looking back the chemistry was not as intertwined  .
Russel's ""Arthur"" is a lot more polished . Helen Mirren delivery always carries an underlying motherly cushioning.
All around it feels like a less ""contrived"" comedy because the jokes are not thrusted up your nose. You get it or you do not.
Russell Brand should be a MEGA star by now , but it is obvious his mind is is summarized in Walt Whitman's quote
""Do I contradict myself?
Very well then I contradict myself,
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)
And THAT is Brand.. There's no subject he can not discuss with authority and profundity or as a totally innocent 7 year old boy.
One thing about the movie . I will NEVER be able to see Helen Mirren  and not remember her role in ""Caligula"" and I write this with a great deal of affection . The lady made a MAN out of me :)",1457568000,,1496,4.332142857142857
4533344,5,B0052ZFYEK,"Even though this is a remake The plot remains essentially the same. Arthur is a cheery wastrel whose wealthy family (here represented by an icy Geraldine James) wishes him to marry a suitable young lady (the effortlessly warm Jennifer Garner, seriously miscast as a gold-digging, status-seeking, nymphomaniac bitch  a far cry from the boring bride-to-be in the 1981 original).
Arthur goes along with this to keep his fortune, but then meets the love of his life  in the old movie, a tough-talking waitress played by Liza Minnelli, but here a whimsical tour-guide and wannabe childrens author, played ineffectually by Greta Gerwig.
I really love this movie, its mindless fun to watch with friends, not really suitable for children though, so don't plan on this one being a family movie.",1457568000,,785,5.077519379844961
4533345,4,B0052ZFYEK,"It bared a distinct likeness to the original Arthur I really enjoy this movie, as a matter of fact I like all of Russell Brand movies, thanks Russell for the view privilege! :)",1457395200,,176,4.363636363636363

4533348,5,B0052ZFYEK,"I love Russell Brand! His humor is irresistible and so believable. I had watched the first one, long time ago, not very appealing to me. This one I could watch over and over again. It is the real deal in how people fall in love and the Prince who has everything falls head over heals in love with the oh so interesting and entertaining penniless princess in poverty or ashes. I think that it is a must watch for anyone who still believes in fairy tales as I always will. Bravo to the ""real mother"" figure here who honestly does love the son of her secret lover, enough to give up all hopes of having a so called decent, but boring life with a so called ""suitable"" marriage arrangement.

4533353,5,B0052ZFYEK,"I honestly did NOT expect to like this movie. I'm not a fan of remakes, personally, and having spent much of my childhood running around doing a drunk Dudley Moore 'Arthur' impression, I was opposed to it being remade in the first place. Fast forward a couple years and I 'forced' myself to watch it because I'm a fan of Russell Brand, fully bracing myself for a couple hours of cringing.

I didn't cringe once. In fact, I laughed out loud more than I ever expected. This wasn't a remake of the original, it was an homage, and managed to become something far more endearing and well acted than I ever expected. I actually cried. That threw me for one hell of a loop... screw you for that Brand and Mirren. Made me freakin cry.

Anyway, the nasty reviews are 100% spawned by purists who don't like remakes. It has nothing to do with this film. I doubt most of them even watched it. Quite possibly one of Brand's best performances, hidden in a film that by definition was meant to be taken as a joke.

Now... I'm terrified of Hollywood actually going through with that DROP DEAD FRED remake with Brand as the title role. After watching this, I'm positive he'll not only be superb in the role of Fred, but he'll make me bawl my ever loving eyes out. Kid can melt your heart when he gets serious.

Well done.",1448582400,,1304,4.37603305785124

Personally I wouldn't compare Russell Brand to Dudley Moore in any way, granted Dudley was a Sex Thimble while Brand is a Sex symbol (self acclaimed).

4533396,5,B0052ZFYEK,"I really enjoyed this movie. Never did see the original, so I had no expectations. But I do think it's rather silly to expect a movie remake to be a carbon copy of the original and not just enjoy what transpires as something of its own standing. They take the basic premiss but make something new of it, happens all the time folks and that's okay. I thought Russell Brand was hilarious and believable as this Arthur. Well played by him, quite well played. Both Helen Mirren and Greta Gerwig were brilliant as well.",1405728000,,514,4.4787234042553195
4533397,1,B0052ZFYEK,"Although Dudley Moore in the original real Arthur was usually unkempt and drunk, he was always well dressed and civil. Russell Brand always looked dirty, gross, and was a clumsy, big bumbling oaf. Whoever cast him in the role of Arthur should have been fired. There's nothing redeeming about him.

Where the real Arthur and Hobson were more like father and son and their banter was cute, Lillian Hobson and new dirty Arthur are always bickering and not funny. Much of Brand's remarks constantly border on the edge of spiteful anger and resentment, even if it's meant to be humorous. And what idiot decided to change Mr. Hobson to Ms. Hobson? It plain didn't work. I was truly embarrassed for Helen Mirren.

Greta Gerwig is no Liza Minelli, and had very little personality to speak of. As lame as Brand was she didn't have enough screen power to counter and challenge Brand. She just seemed to be a vehicle so Brand had someone to converse with. She'll probably do well in some silly contemporary tv sitcom.

This remake pales in comparison to the more polished upbeat 80's original when young men were gentlemen and women were ladies. I'm so saddened that this waste of film ruined one of Hollywood's great comedy classics. Sadly, grungy Russell Brand will be associated with the movie Arthur and the younger generation will never experience the true brilliance and class of the original.

Along with being one of the worst remakes, Hollywood gets kudos for being ""politically correct"" by having Arthur rehabilitate through going to AA!!!! Hollywood, the center of the decadence universe, adds the flavor of hypocrisy to it's list of failures. Bravo!

Brand is flat and charmless as the titular millionaire playboy, while Jennifer Garner gives the movie whatever life it has in the old Jill Eikenberry role (at least they didn't cast Amy Adams in the Liza Minnelli part!).  Still, one area where Warner's remake definitely improves upon the original is in the generous helping of bonus features to be found on this disc; given their efforts, the studio clearly feels this version of ARTHUR is far more worthy of attention and care than the original.

  When all is said and done, hopefully Brand will find his footing in the remake of ARTHUR 2: ON THE ROCKS; if not, this franchise could find itself caught between the moon and New York City...",1389744000,,986,4.776470588235294

I have to be honest, I like the original..but I really liked this too.. I'm not a hardcore fan of Russell's, but in this he is not only appropriately cast as the goofy, immature playboy, but he is really truly funny. The one liners had me rolling non-stop. I loved Helen Mirren slipping into Gielgud's roll of Hobson, she does a fine job and it was a nice reversal. People were too harsh saying this film shouldn't have been made, but if you look at it as ""Son of Arthur"" it may help, either way, it's a fine film on it's own and if you don't demand too much of it, you may be very surprised and end up liking it a lot. True, the 1981 film is beloved by millions and called a modern classic. I own it on DVD, Blu Ray and own an HDX digital copy.. However, I think the charm has worn off over the years, and it's nice to see this updated version..

The original Arthur film is one of the best written comedies of all time with some truly great performances. This remake has only one saving grace and that is Russell Brand, who doesn't come close to Dudley Moore here, but he contributes the films only laughs.

While the original film is sharp and witty, this remake is limp, flat and just fails on almost every level. I don't even understand why they would try to remake this film? It's like lightning in a bottle, the original cast couldn't even do it, just watch Arthur 2 and you'll see what I mean.

I think that Russell Brand did the best possible job that he could with the role but the movie as a whole for me falls flat. I also didn't care for Hobson being played by Helen Mirren,this is no reflection on her acting ability i think she is a fine actress but she is no John Gielgud.

 My only reason for seeing this movie is because Luis Guzman is in it. He plays ""Bitterman"".
 Horrible remake to the original ""Arthur"" movies. The dearly missed Dudley Moore was in the original movie as the short drunk and was very funny, in fact, he also did a second movie.
  This remake with Russell Brand was very difficult to get through and only made me miss Dudley Moore even more.
 Luis Guzman was cute in the Robin-The Boy Wonder costume.

 Also in the cast: Helen Mirren, Jennifer Garner, Greta Gerwig, Nick Nolte, Evander Holyfield, Robert Clohessy.

For a good time and many laughs, please see the two original movies starring Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli.

The revised story/script is intelligent as is the title character and Brand's performance.  The humor is politely hysterical and absurd.  It has a warm feel that makes repeated viewing a pleasure and you really have to watch it more than once to catch everything.

Watching this remake of Arthur, with Russell Brand in the Dudley Moore role was a lot like going for a walk and having a big dog repeatedly jump on me.  He may mean well, he may have nothing but good intentions, but after awhile, it becomes annoying.  Disclaimer: I've never seen the original movie, so I can't say whether this one is better than worse than the oldie.  The plot is the same: a billionaire who has never grown up is faced with the threat of being cut off from the family fortune, unless he marries a woman (Jennifer Garner) who will be good for the family business. Surprisingly, he falls for another woman (Greta Gerwig) who is much poorer but a wacky free spirit who gives illegal tour guides of the city and secretly wants to be a children's writer. (The economic crisis is alluded to in the movie but briefly, and no one suggests that Gerwig self-publish online because that would remove an important plot point.) Given the poor track record of consummated onscreen weddings with the original couple, you can guess the ending.

In 2012, alcoholism isn't considered as funny as it was in the early 80's, so there's a later emphasis on Arthur getting sober. As reviewers have mentioned, it can be difficult to tell if Brand's character is supposed to be sober or drunk in some scenes.

The movie reminded me of ""The Wedding Singer,"" as Gerwig appears to have cloned Drew Barrymore's role, with hairstyle, wardrobe and adorable mechanisms intact.  This is a plus, as like that movie, the less than endearing traits of the main character are balanced by the likeability of the love interest.  Still, though there are moments of genuine sweetness when the romance works, there is also a lot of slobber to endure.",1335225600,,2007,4.635593220338983

The original Arthur film is one of the best written comedies of all time with some truly great performances. This remake has only one saving grace and that is Russell Brand, who doesn't come close to Dudley Moore here, but he contributes the films only laughs.

While the original film is sharp and witty, this remake is limp, flat and just fails on almost every level. I don't even understand why they would try to remake this film? It's like lightning in a bottle, the original cast couldn't even do it, just watch Arthur 2 and you'll see what I mean.

I contacted Warner Brothers about what had happened, and the representative told me there was nothing I could do because they adequately posted the expiration date on the DVD insert, the redemption Web site, and on the box. Two of those methods are moot because you have to open the box before finding out the information. The expiration date is on the back of the DVD in fine print, meanwhile the  ""+ digital copy"" is in very large print on the front of the box.

4533475,4,B0052ZFYEK,"Let me first say that I have NOT seen the original (which I know to some movie buffs is a travesty) but it means I am judging this film entirely on my experience of it, not comparing it to the original. And based on that, this was definitely a solid 4-star comedy for me. Russell Brand stars as Arthur, an alcoholic rich playboy whose mother (also CEO of the family firm) has had it with his behavior, and ordered him to marry an ambitious rising socialite (Jennifer Garner) to soothe investors' worries about succession. Helen Mirren plays his long-standing nanny, and the only one who gets him, while Greta Gerwig plays his love interest.

I felt Russell Brand and Helen Mirren were quite good. He was best in his scenes with her - she pulled a depth out of him, that brought a poignancy to even his comedic scenes with her. I also liked the chemistry between him and Greta Gerwig, although it took half the film for her to grow on me. Although I'm usually a fan of Jennifer Garner, I didn't like her in this role - she was too unlikable and not funny. Brand's scenes with her, as well as some of his slapsticky ones (such as when he works in a candy store for a bit) were the weak points for me. And I did have some discomfort with the comedic moments that were based on his character's alcoholism, although overall I thought the film handled this fine, with Brand attending AA etc., and cleaning himself up in the end (in other words, it toed the PC line, and I felt it didn't glorify drinking, as some reviewers have complained.)

Because of the subject matter, it's not a laugh-out-loud kind of humor most of the time - there is a poignancy to Arthur, and there are sad bits to this film (don't want to spoil it by telling too much.) In the end I was really rooting for Arthur though, and that's a tribute to Brand (and indirectly, Mirren.) So judged on its own, I think it's a worthy movie.",1318204800,2,1897,4.3559322033898304
4533476,5,B0052ZFYEK,"I was skeptical of this reimagining of ""Arthur"".  I saw the original thirty years ago with the late Dudley Moore and liked it then but in retrospect it unintentionally glorifies alcoholism.  Moore's Arthur was the proverbial drunk at the party with the lamp shade on his head with the other guests egging him on.  The premise is dated in these more enlightened times.  Also, I thought that Russell Brand had already covered this terrain with his Aldous Snow character from ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and ""Get Him To The Greek"".  I was immensely pleased to see that this reworking is not so much a glorification of alcohol abuse but a cautionary tale.  Yes, Brand's Arthur is drunk most of the film but our laughter is tinged with pathos instead of approval of his behavior.  Brand's character is 180 degrees removed from Aldous Snow and his Arthur engenders sympathy from the audience.  Helen Mirren makes a terrifically snarky Hobson in a role originated by John Gielgud.  The real eye opener is Greta Gerwig who makes a sweet and wholesome turn as Arthur's true love.

She plays her role in a completely different manner than the classic Liza Minnelli portrayal, but the effect is a more sincere (if a less less comically absurd) story.  Helen Mirren is, of course, brilliant.  The choice to change the sex of some of the characters (mother instead of father, Hobson as a woman) brings another more emotive quality to the story.

4533493,5,B0052ZFYEK,"Let me start out by saying that I'm not a fan of the original 1981 film `Arthur' starring Dudley Moore. There are a number of reasons for this but probably the biggest is that I don't generally enjoy movies with storylines focused on excessive drinking and alcoholics. This is especially true for films within the comedy genre. Having that said, you can imagine that seeing a mediocre 3 star rating overall on the 2011 remake of `Arthur' starring Russell Brand would only reinforce my decision not to view this one.

Fortunately I watched the film before checking out its Amazon rating and I have to admit that I absolutely love it! Russell Brand is amazing as the man-child Arthur and while the image of a loveable drunk is not my forte he definitely pulls it off.  I also loved Helen Mirren as Arthur's lifelong nanny and surrogate Mother.  Brand and Mirren play off each other beautifully and their relationship is edgy, witty and poignant.

What ultimately ties it all together and makes this a 5 star film for me is the hilarious, laugh a minute dialogue. Just about everything that comes out of Russell Brands' mouth is funny, unexpected and memorable. You know, the kind of material you want to write down so you could use it yourself in the future.

4533494,1,B0052ZFYEK,"I am, by no means, a film snob. I can enjoy silly and dumb humor as much as the next person. I laugh at the antics of the Three Stooges, the silliness of Brett Reid in Green Hornet, and the humor in most comedy shows and movies. Of course, there necessarily must be some element of the humorous if a film is to be comedy. Alas for Arthur, the makers of this dud ignored that simple golden rule of comedy, instead opting to produce a film heavy on the idiotic and light on the amusing. In fact, this film was so stupid at points that you practically could feel your IQ dropping, and you were affronted -- not at the film makers, but at yourself, for, while this was without question a hideously misguided effort on their parts, the affront to your intellect that came with watching this monstrosity was yours and yours alone. I shall, therefore, not speculate on the implications of the fact that I soldiered on through this quagmire of inanity, banality, and utter stupidity, all the way to its ridiculous conclusion.
I will only say that the film ended in the same vein as it began -- a bloated, repugnant heap of self indulgent, humorless waste. Much like the character it attempted to portray in an amusing light, this film was one that was born to a foolish beginning, squandered any potential it had in bouts of self aggrandizement, and ultimately suffered an inglorious end. At least, that is what I kept hoping would befall the unlovable pseudo-rogue who pranced, simpered, skipped and whimpered his way through the story.
The actual plot -- a rich, spoiled man who, at his mother's dictates, must choose between love and wealth -- was not enough to make or break the film. The script, the veritable humor vacuum that overwhelmed considerable stretches, and the tragically misguided attempts at eliciting laughs, combined with the utter predictability of the conclusion, however, hastened to drown, bury, and say last rites over whatever potential this story might have had.

The plot just plodded along in that same old tried and true ""random"" love story pattern.

The movie is super unrealistic in that he is throwing away money like it is nothing.  Well if he was living like that he would not be rich.

I can see that a movie like this might be appealing to some women giving them the false idea that a rich person could fall for some random, not so pretty woman on the street.  This idea is not such a bad idea in itself but in here it does not work.  Every scene looks staged and fake.

Russell Brand did a good enough job but wasn't impressive.  And I was sorely disappointed with the actress who played the character Liza Minelli played.  Liza played a strong, unforgettable character.  This actress didn't.  Helen Mirren, IMO, was the only standout.  The first Arthur was a classic, this one isn't.

4533506,2,B0052ZFYEK,"While I thought this movie was somewhat enjoyable, I thought that it stumbled and failed as a remake in several regards.  First of all, I didn't enjoy the characters nearly as much as in the original...of course, how could you possible replace Sir John Gielgud's performance as Hobson in the original?!  Where this film falls down to me is that while it tries to recreate the story line with some reasonable tweaks, all too often it's readily apparent when the producers run out of gas and have to rely on the original movie for even specific scripted lines (for example, when on her inital sick bed, Helen Mirren as Hobson tells Arthur about the ""three books"" and then feigns death, straight out of the original)...for me these shortfalls make the movie feel cobbled together...it's a remake with some twists, but it isn't.  The movie also seems a little disjointed from the original in terms of its transitions through the various scenes, feeling somewhat out of sequence with the original which had to me very logical transitions.  I don't normally provide movie reviews here, but the original Arthur is one of my favorite movies, so I just wanted to share my thoughts about this remake.  I wouldn't avoid seeing this movie, but if you love the original as do I, I don't believe this remake really does it justice.",1311811200,3,1317,4.758771929824562

The writing is on the wall (and screen, sadly) when the very first shot of a film is a shameless product placement. Arrrggghhh. How to make sure I never drink your crappy booze again? Do just that. So there's the Faker's Barf whiskey, and then there's our hero, who has a drinking problem. Which he later cures via AA. So how does that jibe with an ad for alcohol in the first two seconds of the movie? Well, like everything else here, it doesn't.

Brand can be very funny, as in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and less so in Get Him To The Greek, and even less so here. Dudley Moore had a sympathetic charm that Brand doesn't, and Brand is also a one-trick pony as a non-actor. That trick doesn't work here. There's literally only one scene in the whole movie that might be said to have solid acting all around, and that's the sob scene with Mirren and Brand near the end, and it's clearly her dramatic gravitas that rises his boat to a semi-even keel. But in all other scenes SB just seems weak and depthless. I'd like to have liked him, but couldn't have cared much less than the twee script could make me.

This film is like watching a movie put together piece by marketed piece: ""Oh, the break-up scene goes here, and the fight goes here, and the Faker's Barf gets another product placement here..."" Paint by numbers and about as convincing.

And we missed Christopher Cross' voice and melodies even more than Moore. The music here is dead and lifeless, just another aspect of the fine original that's barely even assayed this time around. Mirren is wasted and clearly did it for the cash and the nod to Gielgud. Everyone else walks on and off; Nolte has never done less in any film, one would guess.

All in all, a painfully over-thought and under-delivered pre-marketed piece of Hollywood tripe that need never have existed. Brand better step up his game or he'll be yet another flash in the pan, which is too bad as he clearly has a unique sense of humor.",1311552000,,1973,4.454293628808864
4533508,4,B0052ZFYEK,"Before watching the 2011 version, I treated myself to the original, which I remembered fondly but had not seen in over a decade.  Each version has its own charms.

While I would not call myself a huge Russell Brand fan, he does have the ability to make me laugh out loud with his squeaky voice and man-boy persona.  Dudley Moore's slurring is replaced by RB's occasionally indeciperable Britishisms.  I really think RB is perfect for this part.  He seems to take such infectious delight in silliness and incongruity.  He carries this movie with ease.

I did enjoy Helen Mirren's nuanced performance.  It was an inspired bit of casting to have a woman in the part originally played so inconically by Sir John Gielgud.

I actually preferred Greta Gerwig's portrayal of the love interest over Liza Minelli's.  Liza is so quirky and her character's life seemed a little depressing.  Greta, on the other hand, played the character with more wide-eyed wonder.  I just thought she was awfully cute.

Jennifer Garner's portrayal of Susan did not do much for me.  When she plays neurotic, strident women (as in Juno), she is pretty easy to resist.

I thought the two Arthurs made a perfect frothy weekend double feature.  The script is so clever, the updates worked in the 2011 version, and both lead actors seemed to be having an awful lot of fun.  This is a rare case of a remake being worthy of comparison to the original.",1311552000,3,1416,4.714285714285714

4533510,4,B0052ZFYEK,"I have not seen the original. Overall, the movie was funny. I would recommend it just to have a laugh. Helen Mirren does a great job as the nanny, and the relationship she has with Arthur is actually very touching. Russell Brand does a good job in the role, although a few scenes that were supposed to be funny didn't up being quite so funny (I should also mention he is so English sounding it's ridiculous). Although he was portrayed as a troublemaker who sleeps with lots of women, his character came off as being caring and only really wanting one woman. I was a little disappointed with Jennifer Garner, I expected a better performance from her. I don't think she pulled off her bad girl character very well, and would have been better suited as the main ""good girl"" character, in my opinion. I was also disappointed with the main female character though, I thought she sounded childish and annoying.",1311379200,,904,4.62111801242236
4533511,2,B0052ZFYEK,"Sure, it is fun to see the new Arthur throw away money on stupid, fun things, but the original really had us feeling 'sorry' for the poor little rich boy who just wnated to be loved. Helen Mirren was a very interesting reinterpretation of Hobson, but the magic between Moore and Geilgud cannot be replaced. Even Bitterman in the original had an aire of dignity which is lacking here. We really felt it when Hobson died in the original--all the scenes here felt rushed. This is a very watered down remake just going throught the motions, the 'presence' is just not there and I don't feel any sympathy towards Arthur as I did Moore's character. Not having Arthur's eccentric grandmother Martha was a disappointment and I think Mirren could have pulled that role off even better.",1311379200,2,776,4.713235294117647
4533512,4,B0052ZFYEK,"Not having seen the original Arthur, I had no expectations regarding this movie.  In fact, having seen other movies in which Russell Brand was both good and bad, I estimated that this movie would be either very good or very bad--a toss up.

Arthur gets going rather slowly.  The initial parts of the movie depicting the man-child antics of a dipsomaniac rich-boy get a little tiresome after a while.  Brand's engaging off the wall energy gets a little strained as we learn in detail why Arthur is the kind of person he has become.

The last part of the movie is both sweet and funny.  It serves as a payoff for one's patience with the extended exposition.  Helen Mirren's character helps Arthur to finally realize that he has to grow up.  The scenes leading up to the climax at the wedding are very funny. Brand's scene at wedding shower is an absolute hoot.

Nick Nolte and Jennifer Garner engage in a fierce competition throughout the picture to win the title of the most dislikable character in the show.  Nolte's rough-hewn larger than life presence is hard to beat, but I believe that Garner indeed beats him out, in the end, as the biggest jerk in the movie.  Both did a solid job.

I should mention Helen Mirren.  Her performance in the supporting role of Hobson is excellent.

This was a pretty decent movie, redeemed by the ending of the show.",1311379200,,1352,4.579166666666667
4533513,2,B0052ZFYEK,"There are two positives to this movie - the script writers and Helen Mirren.
As far as script there were a few more uniquely humorous lines that I was expecting; perhaps totaling about 30% of the spoken lines. So that's a little star.
Then there's Helen Mirren's nuanced performance which actually carried the show and that's another little star.
OK, ran out of little stars because the rest of the flim was rollercoaster predictable - been there, seen that, done that NY film industry predictable. As usual, appropriately dumbed down for it's target income demographic.",1311292800,2,570,5.010526315789473
4533514,4,B0052ZFYEK,"I won't go into too many details, but this movie was much better than I expected it to be. Helen Mirren is terrific as a female version of Hobson, and it is impossible not to fall in love with Greta Gerwig as Naomi. But Russell Brand as Arthur is absolutely genius. I had my doubts prior to watching the film, but they were crushed by his hilarity. There are obviously a few raunchy jokes and moments, but for the most part Brand was pretty tame, without losing his slapstick cheekiness and charm. Fans of the original Arthur can rest easy. This is a very respectable revisit.",1311292800,,576,4.443396226415095

Russell Brand is generic and forgetable, I can't imagine what Katy Perry sees in him. I'll give them less than 2 years for her to tire of his lame wittiness and sees how lame he truly is.

4533516,3,B0052ZFYEK,"The new remake of 1981's ""Arthur"" has no Dudley Moore, but it does have Russell Brand running down Park Avenue in his underpants. ""In my scene at St. Bartholomew's Church, Arthur strips down in protest and runs out onto 42nd. Street"", says Brand.  ""New Yorkers now have photos of me in my underwear, which will soon become a Hollywood artifact, just like James Dean's leather jacket"".  No wall-flower, Brand is brash and loud-mouthed...almost perfect as the child-minded millionaire Arthur Bach. ""Arthur"" opens with the police chasing Arthur and Bitterman(Arthur's chauffeur) in  the Batmobile through Wall Street in Manhattan. Arthur's had a few too many, but he's not driving. Arthur is a 30-something who collects random women, movie cars, and cases of vodka. Arthur's powerful, scheming mother has determined that he must quit drinking, and marry Susan; or lose his enormous wealth. Eventually, Arthur enters re-hab at AA, and by now, he's sure he's in love with a spicy young girl from Queens; not Susan. Arthur barges-in on her grammar-school class. Startled, one youngster stands up and challenges Arthur: ""Are you a boy or a girl?"". Enough old-fashioned madcap frenzy continues to sell the movie. The cast includes Helen Mirren(in John Gielgud's role of Hobson; there is valet, here his nanny), indie darling Greta Gerwig as the doll from Queens, and Jennifer Garner as Susan Johnson, his arranged wife. And there's Luis Guzman as Bitterman, and Nick Nolte as gruff father-in-law Bert Johnson. Nolte is terrific, and has about ten lines in one scene. The HD theatrical release and the Blue-Ray disc nicely highlight Central Park, an empty Grand Central Station reserved for lunch, and a grand series of helicoptor swoops over the roof of the Pierre Hotel, where Arthur has his penthouse. The DVD features a selection of Deleted Scenes, and that's it. On Blue-ray, you get a Gag Reel, Deleted Scenes, and ""Arthur Unsupervised"", where Brand and director Jason Winer expose more fun footage, photos, and ad-libs. At 36 1/2 minutes into the movie, Arthur sit in his car checking his cell phone. A name comes up for just a few seconds on his phone book. It is Katy Perry.",1311120000,2,2174,5.016620498614959

After being told that he must either marry someone he hates or love $950 million dollars in inheritance, Arthur (Brand) must decide what is more important, money or love.  I had never seen the original ""Arthur"" with Dudley Moore so I decided to watch that before this one.  After watching the old one I was not impressed and was not looking forward to this one.  While watching this I started to like the old one more and more.  I understand the updates that they needed to do for the new one, but they made it a little too P.C., which took a lot away from the story and who Arthur was in the original.  I will say that I really get annoyed by Russell Brand, but he was not that bad in this one.  I also have to say he is the perfect choice to play this character.  Helen Mirren did a good job, but as much as I like her she is not even close to has funny as John Gielgud was in the original.  This is not as bad as I was expecting, but this one made me like the original more then I did after I watched it.

The characters in this remake seem more cliche, so the relationships between the characters do not click as in the original. Maybe this version works better if one has not seen the original. Having seen both, I think the original is much better. Dudley Moore plays a great Arthur (it was hard to tell the difference between the sober and drunk Arthur with Brand), and Hobson(John Gielgud)was a riot in the original.

Russell was very witty and endearing, especially when he did the scene by the piano at the bridal shower.
