1948301,1,B0000V42AS,"Six words sum up this movie... DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME. Because Julie K Smith was a featured starlet, I laid down my plastic for this disaster, so my review is meant to save you money.  This was bad on so many levels. Usually the amply endowed Julie K Smith will brighten any movie she's in, but having her in cornrolls - come on! The rest of the girls had pimples for boobs and could not act at all.  Enuf said!",1309392000,6,419,4.097560975609756
1948302,1,B0000V42AS,"This DVD was not erotic, instead offering lots and lots of sophomoric, unfunny humor.  Yeah, I suppose there's some female nudity involved, but whoever put this thing together completely lacked any kind of talent and/or creativity, or maybe it's just that they didn't want to make the effort.  The potential was there to produce something campy & fun, but it sadly never happened.  Call this one a waste of a good cast!  Not worth even a rental!",1271721600,4,445,4.740259740259741
1948303,1,B0000V42AS,"this movie was really stupid. i don't even know how i managed to get it. i misread the title and thought it was like an 80s futuristic themed movie, but its really just a poorly written and designed pg rated pornographic video. unless you're 12 and get off by stupidity, bad acting, and fake boobs I wouldnt suggest purchasing.",1263686400,3,327,4.559322033898305
1948304,4,B0000V42AS,"An alien reality show, Plunder That Planet, has targeted Earth for the next conquest.  An evil alien queen plans to locate the planets sexual nexus and drain all of the sexual energy from the planet.  The nexus seems to be somewhere in a girl rock band that likes to take off their tops.  But the girls don't like being a target and fight back.
Goofy MCs, Evil Tyrants, The Bimbo Limbo, special effects, and lots of bare skin await in the science fiction spoof of reality television.  Special appearances by Julie Strain and the Porcelain Twinz.
This disk is packed with plenty of extras including the usual picture gallery, deleted scenes, and more.",1076630400,45,650,4.725663716814159

8003367,3,B0000V42AS,"This is Sci-Fi soft core. An alien species operates a reality TV show called ""Plunder that Planet."" The aim is to steal the sexual energy from that planet. Earth was chosen and an all girl LA band called ""Top Heavy"" is chosen as the conduit for said energy.

This sci-fi spoof is all about showing off as much breast as possible. Julie Strain actually has a small role in the film, but shows up more in the extra features. Indeed, the extra features exhibit as much nudity as the film including fully nude under water shots which is as much fun as girls on trampolines.

As a sci-fi spoof it ranks well below ""Flesh Gordon.""  3 stars for the nudity

8003368,5,B0000V42AS,"someone's else  description of GP-porno is very apt and accurate- Great collection of tit and nipples shapes in one movie, solid story line with suspense ending interspersed with great sketches ranging from camp to psychedelic (really cool black light dance scene) from videogame-like escape to ads extolling the cost advantage of mismatched nipples in cyber-escorts.
I watched Barbarella and I found Baberellas a lot more statisfying.

are you expecting ART ? don't get it are ypu expecting Porno? definitely don't waste your money are you looking for whole some fun? This is your movie.

8003369,4,B0000V42AS,"As other reviewers have pointed out, ""Baberellas"" is a sexy science fiction spoof.  The main surprise I got from watching it was how good it looks - the special effects, sets, and overall production values are much like a serious sci-fi movie. Apparently the producers ran out of money for costumes, though, since most of the ladies in the movie wear little or nothing a great deal of the time. The story is inane, with an evil alien queen attempting to conquer Earth, and to that end she needs to find the sexual nexus here, which she determines is a girl rock band. There are a bunch of good sci-fi gags here, such as ads from a business called ""Cy Burr's Sexbot Sales"" with a guy selling sexy lady robots, the ""Galactic Erotic"" channel, ""Club Stargasm,"" breasts that shoot laser beams, and the like.

I basically bought this movie because I had liked Shauna O'Brien and Julie K. Smith a lot in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bare-Wench-3-The-Path-of-the-Wicked/dp/B000BNX58A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bare Wench 3: The Path of the Wicked</a>, which is a similarly sexy sci-fi/horror spoof. Well, I enjoyed them too in ""Baberellas,"" although I was disappointed that Shauna only disrobes once for about 5 minutes in the whole movie, although she was quite a good actress as the evil alien queen. The ladies in ""Baberellas"" are very pretty and sexy, although there is mostly toplessness here, with only a little total nudity. The reviewer who commented that the ladies here have pimples for breasts, except for Julie K. Smith, was being unfair. Only one woman has small breasts, although it's true that Julie is the only one who is SUPER-stacked.

I do think that the producers got too carried away in presenting this as if it's a serious science fiction film. As I noted, the movie looks very good, but it could have been done in a more erotic fashion. As one reviewer noted, there are no sex scenes in the movie, although there is plenty of nudity and skimpy outfits as well as a lot of sexual humor here. But overall it's not intensely erotic. Still, ""Baberellas"" is great eye candy and lots of fun, so I'm glad I bought it.",1391558400,6,2172,4.9289617486338795
8003370,4,B0000V42AS,"From strictly an entertainment point of view, this movie is surprisingly solid. For a B movie these guys put a ton of time, effort and (likely) money into the special effects, which even by today's standards exceed what you'd expect of a movie in this genre. In 2003 this clearly took a monumental effort.

That said, it's pretty much nonsense, although not as sexualized as one might expect. Lots of toplessness and a modest amount of full nudity, but not a single sex scene. I know what one expects to get with these films, but it seems like the nudity was intertwined with the production rather than vice versa. A lot of goofy sight gags (shooting lasers out of a metal bra) and that kind of stuff, and without the superlative special effects and top-shelf extras (there are deleted scenes, etc., that you basically never get with releases in this genre) this probably gets two stars. Although these girls were hot back in those days. Pontoon-chested Julie K. Smith is a personal all-time favorite, and Sasha Peralta is flat-out gorgeous--I always felt that she was underutilized in the B movie industry. Regina Russell has a killer body.

So if you're looking strictly for sexual titillation, you're probably going to be disappointed in ""Baberellas,"" and if you're looking for great cinema you certainly will be. But if you're looking for male-aimed entertainment for an hour and a half, this movie is worth a look.",1353456000,6,1419,4.8353909465020575
