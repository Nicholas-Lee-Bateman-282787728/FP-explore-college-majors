Teaches you to use body language that the horse can understand. Creates cooperation instead of fear and resentment. Allows him to listen to you instead of its fight or flight instincts.",1338422400,2,359,5.0
8072779,2,B0009P5QRI,"I bought this on the recommendation of a ""friend of a friend"", with high expectations that it would contain something of value. It turned out to be a bad imitation of a Monty Roberts ""join-up"" session, without any of the follow up work of the Roberts videos.

There are a few scenes where ""Pony Boy"" is shown riding, and from what you can see, he really doesn't ride very well either.

Bottom line: Save your money for something more informative.",1154649600,4,446,4.5625
8072780,5,B0009P5QRI,"With the groundwork laid in ""The Simple Truth about Horses: Defining your Space"" (Episode #1), you have started working towards earning your horse's Respect.

Earning your horse's Trust means that your horse literally trusts you with his/her wellbeing. It is one of the deepest and most important aspects of developing a true bond or Relationship with your horse. This video sets out to explain and help you lay the foundation of doing this with your horse. The excellent video footage and explanation both before and during each phase let you see what you might expect as reactions from your horse, how to address them, and how to recognize when you and your horse turn the corner towards getting your horses Trust.

Another Great training video from GaWaNi Pony Boy, and a great addition to any horse training library!

I should have known that PonyBoy would come out with a horse training series that would surpass anything else available out there! I really enjoyed the professional presentation, time was obviously taken to make this easy to watch, understand as well as enjoy -( if you an out-take fan, get ready to laugh!) Nice to see a famous horse trainer be real, down to earth and one of us. Pony can really teach well, you can understand him, and he not only explains exactly what he is doing at that moment, but WHY he is doing it, and it all makes perfect sense. I'm ready to get to the barn and get started, I'm going to pick up Episode One as well, and am anxious to see the rest in this series. Overall, this is a fine quality item from the man who has always done things top notch with all of his other books and DVD's - 2 thumbs up!",1116547200,8,969,4.21505376344086
