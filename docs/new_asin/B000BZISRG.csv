2450153,5,B000BZISRG,"I have been waiting for this release for a LONG time. I like to think Im a huge fan. I know it isn't released yet, but I will be getting the first set on the stand. This show is something I could watch over and over and never grow bored with. Only thing I hope for is the release of ALL seasons faster than Season 3. So, when will season 4 be out? Thanks. You've made my day.",1139270400,3,375,3.8205128205128207
2450154,5,B000BZISRG,"After two somewhat uneven but still superb seasons, the best written and acted television series of the past twelve years hit its stride with Season Three.  The release of this set has been delayed for far too long, while the marketplace has been glutted with much inferior product.  Hopefully, this, like cream, will rise to the top, convincing Fox to release future editions in a more timely manner.",1139184000,3,401,4.882352941176471
2450155,4,B000BZISRG,I'm thrilled that they're finally releasing season 3 but I think that Sipowicz's character was HYSTERICAl when Danny Sorenson was his partner. My friend and I used to call it the Andy Sipowicz Comedy Hour. I REALLY REALLY hope they continue to release each season. SOON!,1138838400,4,270,4.891304347826087
2450156,5,B000BZISRG,"I am so glad the third season will finally be available on DVD -- indeed I am on the edge of my seat waiting for the next installment. I never missed an episode of this program when it was on air -- at least as long as David Caruso and later Jimmy Smits were on board. After that the quality of the show declined slowly, but steadily. But, when it was at its peak it was UNBELIEVABLE! More than a decade later it still holds up, owing to crisp, edgy writing and peerless casting.",1137456000,5,479,4.1063829787234045
2450157,5,B000BZISRG,"I know this is not released yet but I remember this season like it was yesterday.  By giving it 5 stars I'm giving 20th Century Fox the benefit of the doubt on the packaging and extras.  They've done a great job so far with seasons 1 and 2.

The Jimmy Smits (Bobby Simone) years were the best seasons of

NYPD Blue and, for my money, Season 3 was the best!.  The rapport between Sipowicz and Simone was seamless by this season and the storylines and character development were superb.  Giancarlo Esposito is fantastic as a guest star on the ""Hollie and the Blowfish"" episode. Also in this episode is Daniel Von Bargen, the guy who played George Castanza's boss on the last years of Seinfeld, as a despicable detective who really gets on Bobby's bad side.

And, ""Death in the Family"" and ""Closing Time"" are heartbreaking but essential to Sipowicz's development.

Thanks, 20th Century for finally releasing this.  I can't wait.",1136246400,13,925,4.695652173913044
2450158,5,B000BZISRG,"Although I have not yet got this dvd set I know it well from the tv showing. We all know this is probably the best show ever seen ,so to get it on dvd will be sheer joy.

As the later series were never shown on Britsh tv I really HOPE they wll all be released

2450159,5,B000BZISRG,"Having bought the first two seasons, had to have number three. A full season of Jimmy Smits character as he was fully engrained into the show and with relationship with his partner played perfectly by Dennis Franz. Packaging was a little disappointing with episodes on both sides of discs and no pamphlet explaining episodes. Keeps cost/price down, I suppose, which is a good thing but not up to standard set with the first two seasons. Five stars for content as series really hit it's stride this season.",1135728000,4,505,4.816091954022989
2450160,5,B000BZISRG,I have waited so long for season three to be released.  I was starting to worry if they were even going to release anymore of them.  This is the first full season with Jimmy Smits as Andy's partner (thank goodness David Caruso is gone).  I'm looking forward to opening up my package when released and popping it in the player.  I hope that season four will be released soon as well.,1134950400,7,382,4.338028169014085
2450161,5,B000BZISRG,I can't believe it's taken this long for Season 3 of NYPD Blue to be released.  This is one of the best shows to ever be shown on television and Season 3 is really where it started to shine.,1134518400,8,190,3.871794871794872
2450162,4,B000BZISRG,"This is the first full season where Jimmy Smits and Dennis Franz are teamed together.  NYPD picks up where it left off the previous season, breaking new ground in police drama.

There are some standout episodes which I consider ""must see's"" for any NYPD Blue fans.  The first episode is ""Backboard Jungle""; an episode where Sipowicz is removed from a case after exchanging racial epithets with an African American civil rights leader, who is being uncooperative with police.  Another great episode is ""A Tushfull of Dollars"" in which one of Simone's CI's life is put in danger because of other cops more concerned with getting credit on cases.  And towards the end of the season, ""A Death in the Family"" has Sipowicz suffer an immeasurable loss and has his old demons resurface, and could cost him his job, his marriage, and his life.

The bond between the two detectives really evolves over this season, and is totally solidified at the end of the season, when Simone does everything possible to save Sipowicz from losing everything.

It is unfortunate that it took over two years for this season to be released.  But hopefully, this will be just the beginning of the other seasons being available.  Simone was the best fit for Sipowicz.  And the 3rd season of NYPD Blue is the springboard.

Here is the list of the epsidoes in Season 3......

2450185,4,B000BZISRG,"I recently found a season 1 & 2 box  set for $10 each locally, so now i have to get the rest.  Those 2 had a nice case with a little booklet with a synopsis of each episode the entire season, having 6 discs per season. These are 4 discs in a skimpy crappy chinese plastic box not worth a dime. The DVD's are plain blank that look like some pirated stuff. The name is imprinted in very tiny letters in the center otherwise we don't know what DVD or CD it is.

Packaging gripes aside, I love the series, I watched most of it originally but have forgotten most of what I watched back then so it seems new now. Lots of great actors and acting, writing and directing. Pretty authentic it seems and a little R-rated for it's time is not much now. They had to watch the language more than the nudity - David Caruso full body nude from the back? Yikes!",1494201600,,844,4.1030303030303035

2450429,5,B000BZISRG,"I am in love with the show. When it was on TV I barely watched but now it is my go to binge series. You can see how the program shaped how we view TV today because their is a lot of sexual content which I would not have wanted to watch with my then teenage son. The TV networks cleaned up their act somewhat and now the networks do more suggesting. I enjoy the guest stars and seeing them in the start of their acting careers. The show has a lot of racial tension ( which only demonstrates that not much has changed in 2016.) Over all, if you are looking for a binge worthy series this fits the bill.",1453766400,,600,3.9669421487603307

2450499,5,B000BZISRG,"From the first episode I enjoyed this series tremendously, The blending of the private lives with their everyday crime solving profession worked so well. Just about any police officer who spent their career in law enforcement can relate to many situations in their lives. Alcoholism, relationships, troublesome cases etc. The actors blended so well together at least as far Dennis Franz and David Caruso and then later Jimmy Smits. In later episodes he continued to be great but his supporting actors ran a little thin. I could not understand why Franz did not continue his career. As a matter of fact most of the actors on that series have stumbled in their careers. I guess they were the victims of type casting.",1446768000,,714,4.860655737704918

2450654,5,B000BZISRG,"I was an enormous fan of NYPD Blue when it first aired back in the 90's. So, of course I am not happy that the whole series cannot be purchased as a collector's edition box set. No matter, for now at least as it's on Amazon Prime. For now. They seem to have issues keeping content and the show is unavailable elsewhere. I now am getting the joy of rewatching with my 15 year old son who loves this show! And season 3 is where it's at it's peak. The combo of Dennis Franz and Jimmy Smits had the greatest on screen chemistry. And 20 years later through fresh eyes, my son agrees. He asked me how many Emmy awards each had won and I thought I was disappointed that Jimmy Smits never won. My son asked me if I knew why. I had to explain to him that E.R. was the darling of the critics and usually won most of the awards. He at first thought Anthony Edwards had to have been the winner, but when I told him George Clooney won over Smits he said, ""How can the WORST Batman of all time beat out Jimmy Smits?"" I just smiled and said that is why I refuse to watch award shows and that most of the time, television critics have their heads up.....Well, they're good acrobats. All of that Hollywood tofu and yoga. The point is, WATCH THIS SHOW WHILE YOU STILL HAVE THE CHANCE.

2450707,5,B000BZISRG,I started this season right after finishing Season 1 because it looked like Season 2 was available only by buying the dvd or individual episodes for sale each.  But after 5 episodes I found the Season 2 series for Prime viewing.  I've gone back to catch up but what I saw of Smits as the replacement for John Kelly only makes for a better show not less satisfaction.  Now new story lines playing out with regular characters that keep you coming back for 'what's next' even as you enjoy the crime-solving business of the NYPD.

The show dealt with current issues like racism, street crime, and politics in a way that probably could not be done in today's PC world. The series has some of the best characters/actors and dialog of any police drama, maybe of any tv drama, and it has the awards and nominations to prove it.  As far as I'm concerned, NYPD Blue is the best police drama ever, bar none. If you like this genre, watch NYPD Blue and see for yourself.",1427932800,,603,4.336283185840708

2450836,3,B000BZISRG,"The characters of the show are the most engaging thing about it, even though they are borderline ""stock"" at times.  This is not my favorite of Bochco's shows -- I found Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere better, in character development, story lines.  I liked Philly, too, which didn't last beyond one season - inexplicably.  One interesting thing about watching this show, all these years later, is seeing the parade of actors who have since become much more successful, who have shown up as regulars on series like West Wing, or Mad Men.",1425081600,,540,4.78494623655914

2450845,5,B000BZISRG,"This season of NYPD Blue is chock full of interesting themes: I like Patsy Ferrara, the ex prize fighter who taught Bobby Simone about birds. There's a very nice dynamic between Patsy and Bobby; there will be others. Another theme of Season three is Bobby working through being set up by his friend, Ray Di Salvo, lots of plot twists, to keep you on your feet. I also like Sgt. Martens, of IAB looking out for Bobby, telling him that ""...everything's a situation..."". For a member of the so-called Rat Squad, Martens is a pretty stand up guy. Another theme of this season is the dust up between Andy and a Community Organizer named Kwasi Olishula; over a Basketball game being held to honor a neighborhood kid who died in Police custody. Andy throws out the ""N"" word after he and Kwasi get into it. Plenty of sparks in these episodes.",1424390400,,834,4.529801324503311

But the total unreliability of Amazon Prime's transmisson of programming is a ridiculous joke. Many nights, the programming is entirely unwatchable.

2450878,5,B000BZISRG,"The third season has continued the high standards kept during seasons 1 and 2. Jimmy Smits really takes over the starring role that was vacated by David Caruso after season 1.

Season 3 deals with Andy and Sylvia becoming parents and Andy losing his oldest son to murder. Kim Delaney continues to shine in her role of detective and Smit''s girlfriend. Gail O'Grady left the show in the season finale but the other regulars remained with the show.

Never watched this show when it was airing on ABC but started watching it on the Audience channel (Direct TV channel), which aired the first two seasons. Since I have Amazon Prime, which allows one to watch anything Amazon sells on DVD, have begun watching the series on Amazon Streaming.

2450947,5,B000BZISRG,"Bochco's groundbreaking TV shows succeeded because of the liberal use of nostalgia and--at times--melodrama, a veneer noticeable even during the 1990s when the show began airing. NYPD Blue doesn't shy away from sweetness, some of it adolescently portrayed, like something you might read in a thoughtful comic book. What elevates the series is an extremely likable, but flawed lead character, a character who mutters racial slurs and pays price, and those characters who love and admire him. The other element which makes the series a true pleasure is the Millich (sic) dialogue: ""I'll keep a good thought for you, James"" or ""How about the tearing, down there (after his wife gives birth). . . What about the discomfort?"" Lovely stuff, but odd...Does anyone in NY really talk like that? The whole subculture is eccentric, but not off-putting. Since the characters love each other deeply, and love the job, I can't help but love both as well.

I'd stack the best episodes up against anything David Mamet has written (""Death in the Family"" during season three is extraordinary)--save for Mamet's transcendent Glen Garry Glen Ross.

Like the worst of Jag and 24, the physical torture of suspects is treated as necessary--with no editorial disapproval, thus playing into the myth of redemptive violence.  That's a problem, seeing attractive stars beat the heck out of suspects or at least threaten violence in every episode.

The show came out the year my daughter was born and when I was in graduate school. I could only catch an episode every now and then. Re-watching them takes me back to the 90s, when entertainment began to regularly feature inspired writing on important subjects. I'm grateful for this show. Watching it again in 2014, is a distinct pleasure.",1413331200,,1761,5.041237113402062

It's hard to make a show awesome for 3 or 4 years but they did it for 12 years & really only ever made about 4 or 5 bad episodes (I say bad just to mean it didn't live up to the NYPD Blue standard I'd still pick them over a show like CSI Miami).",1412812800,,474,3.7

Jimmy Smits fits in well with the rest of the cast and the way the creators weave the daily stories with the development of the characters over time is exceptional. A episode I recently viewed showed the racial tension between the cops and the community in mid 90s NY. Something that is still a problem 20 yrs later.

Again Shout is cheap..  What gets me is........ They put CC on things..  They have done it..
Why not on this?  ( MONEY). They did not want to spend it to put it on. Are pay for the rights to put it on...
And being cheap as they are...... Will cost them sales...
Season 1-4 have SDH & CC on them.... 5 on... No!  So sad to say it. If you are a fan of the show, and need SDH are CC. And want to get the all of it. After season 4. You are out of luck as far as I can tell. Unless something comes up..",1406073600,,685,3.639455782312925

It's great to go back and see actors when they were younger.  My husband and I both watch this before we met, so now watching it together we get to share our insights from the first time and now.

And let's NOT forget Dennis Franz.  His character Andy is amazing.  Watching the growth of this one character is truly what makes watching NYPD Blue worth while.  Thank you for making this ava.

I would suggest anyone who like NYPD to go back and take another look from the beginning show.  I set down in the late evenings and watch at least 2 shows.  Everyone should see this again.",1397088000,,284,4.423076923076923
2451058,5,B000BZISRG,As a retired LEO I have to say this is about as close as you can get to the big city streets Granted It is Hollywood and somethings are exaggerated and some things are not even menntioned. Over all a GREAT 12 Season Show. It should have never ended NYPD Blue Out Ranks Law and Order In Realism Easily. A perfect example how many times do your ever see a ADA Or DA try and make a deal with a perp without their lawyer Who really makes the deal for them Come on seriously. Anyway this is all my opinion. NOTE I do ejoy SVU though on occasion. Thank You :-),1397001600,,554,4.0

2451061,5,B000BZISRG,As usual Jimmy Smits and Dennis Franz are outstanding. This show is timeless. It could be today's NYC and it still works.  I am watching all the episodes. Too bad Amazon instant video only works on WIFI or I'd be watching it at the gym on my LTE.,1396656000,,246,4.125

2451076,5,B000BZISRG,"Dennis Franz Rules Series 3!
We loved the series way back in the early 1990s - watched it in Mass and London.

We are currently watching the series again and getting even more out of it the 2nd time around. We are up to Series 5 and so much better without commercials.",1394841600,,268,4.153846153846154

2451078,5,B000BZISRG,"Nothing today compares with this NYPD Blue series.  I'm through with the 3rd Season which has won all kinds of awards, and on to Season 4.  Prime streaming is worth it if this was the only show available.  Smart, intriguing with great acting.",1394755200,,242,4.5813953488372094

2451081,5,B000BZISRG,I love everything about this series.  The casting was fabulous.  The third season details all the drama and humor of the 15th detective squad.,1394582400,,142,4.875
2451082,5,B000BZISRG,"View of the stresses and quick pace of life in a detective unit in the NYC police department.  The very hard decisions, actions, and outcomes give some feel for the way the detectives deal with their own emotions while performing their jobs under a myriad of pressures specific to the case while following the protocols of their positions.

Terrific cast, - Detectives Sipowicz and Simone in particular, but all of the actors/actresses are great.",1394582400,,446,5.013513513513513
2451083,5,B000BZISRG,Andy Sipowichz [sp] and Bobby Simone don't mess around in these 3rd year episodes. Top-flight entertainment!! So sad to see Abondando leave...,1392940800,,142,5.5
2451084,4,B000BZISRG,"What can I say beyond the headline? Season 3 is all of those things. From Adrian's ""exorcist head spinning medusa"" transformation once she got James in the sack (shoulda seen that coming when she set a sex date 2 months out) to Sipowcz internal battle with his demon alchohol to Andy Jr. being murdered and the tear-jerking two episodes surrounding that to the racially charged Blackboard Jungle episode to that incredibly sexy yet tasteful shot of Sylvia naked on her knees next to Andy in the final episode... this show has it all. It's amazing how many actors and actresses we think of as ""great"" today made their way through this show. I am stuck - hooked - and will not stop watching until I finish the final episode of season 12.

The title might also be: ""The Andy Sipowiscz Show"".  Dennis Franz deserves some new, special award for his well-rounded, sometimes somber and sometimes funny performances. Jimmy Smits does a great job, and is such a pleasure to see.  The secondary characters are a treat; each has his or her own personality and these human aspects figure critically in the plot.  Deserves SIX god stars.",1392681600,,519,5.216867469879518

I think he is vastly under rated as a comedian. If you watch this series, you will see his deadpan/sarcasm shine....his timing is always right on the money and it's totally believable.
Jimmy Smits shines as his partner, Bobby Simone.  This is one of the best seasons of this series.

2451141,5,B000BZISRG,"This long-running television series became one of my favorities many years ago when it first appeared --- I've seen countless other interesting series in the intervening years and given Amazon's Prime membership provides free access to many gems from the past, I've seized the opportunity to go over the entire NYPD Blues run (I didn't always see later years in sequential order), this time episode by episode as they were presented.

In every critical category it has met or exceeded standards of excellence and often, in my opinion, has produced episodes so very extraordinary that Hollywood's years of movies (including a few that were quite good), have never approached.  Broadly speaking, it offered the best story lines (often with sub-plots that continued for many episodes), highly believeable actors (both bit and on-going), backgrounds, music, and basically, each characteristic simply grabbed me.  In my humble opinion, Dennis Franz was one of the finest actors in the world --- his Sipowicz was to me a riveting combo of Superman, Spiderman, the Hulk, with occasional sides of Woody Allen.  Knowing the searing pain he constantly felt while working as a detective in a world of child molesters, rapists, killers, druggies, and receiving totally undeserved verbal attacks and worse, often from the very people he sought to help, made him a very sympathetic character.  A superb actor amongst fine colleagues.",1377734400,,1419,5.261061946902655

2451145,5,B000BZISRG,"I can't pick a favorite season because they were all very good.
The hardest one to watch is when Simone passes away.  He is such a great actor.  Very sad episode.
Appreciated Andy's dry wit in all episodes.  He was amazing.
Only character I didn't like was Russel. There was never any variation to her acting.  With so many episodes, her every movement or expression remained the same.
(Martinez) and Gordon Clapp were extremely good.  The writers did an amazing job also.",1376524800,,472,4.7073170731707314

2451167,3,B000BZISRG,"This is a great season with great writing, acting and directing. I still believe this is one of the best produced cop shows ever and this season was fantastic.

The problem with this set is the double sided disk quality is so bad I can't watch certain episodes at all, including The Blackboard Jungle, a powerful episode that pays off in season 4 in surprising ways. Who do I need to get in touch with about replacing these bad disks? I bought 'em brand new and there's not a scratch or thumbprint on them and I tried them in multiple players- it's the format.

Maybe your player will handle them better- I owned a set years ago that played fine but I've seen that others had similar problems. Any help I can get would be appreciated.",1370822400,,734,4.389705882352941

You will be to-the-point of demanding Federal Prosecution of the people who thought ""Keeping up with the  -- I'm Not Finishing That"" was a good idea! Dennis Franz, who started on ""Hill Street Blues"" and cemented his ability to play the tough cop in his first 10 seconds, could carry this series alone.

The story lines from show to show always have a great mix of quirky characters as well as a good mix of serious and lighthearted storylines. They do a great job of character development which gives you a great like or dislike of the character the actors are portraying. The cast members almost always give top*notch perfomances in their roles . The show is paced incredibly well and makes a 40 minute episode seem like 20 !
Last but not least is the great openning theme song, just awesome.  This show is the main reason I signed up for Amazon Prime as this show can't be purchased on dvd past the 4th season.  Great Show !!!!!",1367107200,,707,4.348484848484849

The characters are amazing, the best is Dennis Franz who has a word for anything.  But it gets gritty and the despite the nudity and language (which were somewhat a first for its time), it's nothing that we really haven't seen before.  I know it used to air at 10 PM.

While David Caruso and Jimmy Smits received top billing, the star is really Dennis Franz,  and his independent thinking is the highlight for me. Noteworthy also is the the interplay between Dennis and James  McDaniel who plays Lt. Fancy. Current police procedurals can learn a lot from this show.

2451221,5,B000BZISRG,"...The sexiest couple in tv series history. Their love seens were hot, hasn't been any as intense on network tv since, unfortunately. Kim Delaney is fantastic, playing a complex role, depicting her struggle with alcoholism as it manifests itself, stemming from a past history of childhood sexual abuse. I think survivors everywhere were applauding her portrayal. Jimmy Smits' efforts were seamless, playing an honest, strong, loyal detective as if he really was a cop. Brilliantly done Jimmy.

2451228,5,B000BZISRG,"NYPD Blue's third season builds on the success the show had in Season 2 with integrating Jimmy Smits as the new partner for Dennis Franz's Andy Sipowicz, as well as the addition late in the season of Kim Delaney as Detective Diane Russell.  While much of the personal drama of Season 3 stems from the developing, up-and-down romance between Bobby Simone and Diane, personal tragedies overshadow most everything else going on.

One story developed involves Diane's dysfunctional family, whose problems lead to the death of her father and Diane's startling revelation of childhood abuse.  These events lead to problems with her own alcoholism and tension between her and Bobby.  Then, later in the season, Andy shockingly discovers that his own son, Andy, Jr., has been shot and killed trying to intervene in a case of street violence.  After that, all hell breaks loose.

Not only does Andy fall off the wagon, but he comes closer to losing his job than in Season 1.  Bobby eventually guns down Andy J.'s killers in a clean shoot, but Sipowicz goes to hell and back before regaining his ability to function, let alone his job.  This storyline in particular is a heartbreaker considering the relationship the two characters had built up while overcoming Andy J.'s bitterness toward his absentee father.  The last few episodes of the season are positively gut-wrenching.

Other noteworthy parts of the season include the odd relationship between James Martinez and Adrienne Lesniak.  After lying about being gay to avoid him, Adrienne eventually gets over her reservations and consents to see him.  Then, she becomes jealous and clingy to the point of driving him away.  It's no big surprise that the character of Lesniak didn't return for another season.  More sadly, Gail O'Grady, aka Donna Abondando, leaves the series, with her character taking a job with Apple computers.  She was one of my favorites, and none of the subsequent PAA's were as interesting.  Finally, Andy and Sylvia welcome a son, who Andy dedicates his life to after the death of Andy, Jr.

2451244,2,B000BZISRG,"I'll skip the glowing praise for the show in this short review, and instead address something I feel has been largely ignored: the packaging.

Seasons 1 and 2 came in a nice fold-out boxed set and ran at 6 DVDs. They played great on all my DVD players and were as beautiful as the content on them. Unfortunately, someone decided to save money by using 2-sided DVDs and reduce the count to 4 (and smaller packaging as well) with Seasons 3 and 4. For those of you not familiar with dual-sided discs I say this . . . Ordinarily, if they are used it's to have a 1-side is fullscreen (pan and scan) 1-side is widescreen movie disc. This is in itself no great hardship, since the main issues with such discs (there's nowhere to safely touch but the inner ring and outer edge, which is damn difficult putting it in or taking it our of a case) is mitigated by the owner's preference of 4:3 or 16:9; That is, you'll always play one or the other so the inevitable fingerprints are not that big a deal, since you'll touch the 'top' you never play.

Unfortunately, the episodes in NYPD Blue are on both sides of all the discs, so the inevitable fingerprints (and I imagine scratches, sooner or later) prevent you playing episodes. Not to mention that out of the box I had issues playing them on one of my DVD players. I don't know if it's bending the spec on compression, oversized discs, or some exotic new copy-protection mod, but I will say this: I resent buying discs that appear designed to fail and cost me to replace later on. I, for one, would gladly pay extra for the single-sided DVDs and larger packaging they used previously. I'm Extremely unhappy with the new packaging\discs and would advise anyone looking to get the series to think twice if they have problems with newer or dual-sided DVDs.

Short form? Horrible changes I suspect were just to boost a profit margin at the fans' expense. Not only am I unlikely to pick up Season 5 or later if they stick with the format, I'm seriously considering unloading what I already bought.",1180828800,48,2033,4.489189189189189

2451250,5,B000BZISRG,"I never thought I would love a show the way that I love NYPD Blue, I have watched this show from the day they aired it on tv in 1993. But is sad by the fact they keep screwing around with the reruns of the show by different stations.

At first TNT carried the show for quiet sometime, now they just stop showing it all together and left that sorry picture on called Charmed. Please tell me where in the world 3 dizzy chicks can bring drama in the afternoon the way NYPD Blue did for so many years. I really would like for the networks to reconsider and bring the show back on tv in the afternoon so I can be able to watch it. I am lost without NYPD Blue so I just don't watch the station anymore since they took my show off. Every year brought you different charcaters and people but my favorite star of course is none other that Dennis Franz, I liked how he growed with all the situations he was dealt but he always seem to come out in the end even though he was wrong about the person.

I feel that the producer should just go ahead and put show  in a collection package (seasons 1-12) and let the viewers just buy it that way instead of waiting to see if they get many views from one season or another. My rating scale for the show IS 100 percent GOLD GOLD GOLD. So let't get the show back on tv so a loyal fan as myself can start solving the cases again with the 15 preceint. I have so many good episodes just like the one when Andy make sgt and they all gather downstairs that was nice, when he had to clear Danny name so he could keep is job, and the emotions that he showed when Bobby Simone died, and last but not lest when Bobby had to come to him again to help him with John Cark, you just can't ask for no show no better that NYPD Blue.

2451251,5,B000BZISRG,"Wow!  I'm currently on disc 2, of this fine collection.  I have to say this is the finest season so far, as compared to seasons 1 and 2. I'm still waiting for my favorite ""Daddy Kool"" Bad Rap episode, coming in Season 4, my favorite all time Andy Sipowicz interview episode.

The show continues to be filmed on the mean streets of New York, in this season.  What a breath of fresh air.  Actual location of the intended written script.  There's something you don't see all the time anymore.  Oftentimes, they are filming in Toronto, and acting like its New York.  And the last seasons of this show (can somebody post a comment, when this started) were actually filmed on a stage set, thousands of miles away from New York.

The pacing, and intertwined stories are still believable (in a TV sort of way) and don't get to the inexplicable sense, they were by as early as season 6 (the Ricky ""Silverbells"" Schroder seasons; uhh, why is a cop the age of Detective Martinez in his early years, suddenly chief detective?)  I love all the stories and the combined drama both involving our detectives and the victims they are helping.

Wonderful season!

2451252,5,B000BZISRG,"Season 3 of ""NYPD Blue"" was my favorite season of my favorite TV show of all time.  That was where ""Blue"" hooked me - throwing me into a drama I had never seen the likes of before on TV - especially network TV.  I suppose there were similar plot elements and storylines explored in past shows or done more graphically in feature films, but even having seen some of this before, I had never seen it done so well and so effectively.  Credit the writing, the performances and a sense of in-your-face real world authenticity - we feel we know these characters - they ARE real.

Why did season 3 grab hold of me some much more?  I don't know.  There was a lot of hoopla surrounding this series when it began over its frank depictions of racism, alcoholism, sex, violence and rough language (all this, of course, is what made it feel like something of a docudrama versus just another police serial); and again in its second season with the whole David Caruso, Jimmy Smits thing.  Season 1 had plenty of great storylines and season 2 was riveting as a season of change; full of new ideas, different from season 1.  It retained the gritty realism of the first season's police stories, but managed to become more involving on a character level.  Season 3 is so spectacularly effective because, unlike season 2, this is not a season of change.  Where season 2 got much of its drama from everything being shaken up, in season 3 we knew and cared about all the characters on a much deeper level.  Sensing this - using this - the writers decided to pull the rug out from under us resulting in some of the best drama I had seen before or since.

At the risk of some of you having not yet seen this season I will be vague in my descriptions, but Russell's family situation and drinking, the basketball game gone bad that exposes Sipowicz race hostilities, Simone's battle with a blowhard cop that shatters his usually cool demeanor, and of course the two-parter involving a tragedy for Andy that effects everyone around him - especially Simone.  These two episodes are probably the best two hours of ""Blue"" ever.  You could also make a case for the 5-hour, virtual mini-series that leads up to Simone's exit early in season six.  Either way, that is ""Blue"" at its rawest, most emotionally gut-wrenching.  None of it would be effective at all if we didn't care about these characters so much.  And it is to this show's awesome credit that we do.  Dennis Franz and Jimmy Smits are simply wondrous in their performances.  And everyone is great, but always better when interacting with the two extraordinary leads. And David Milch and the rest of his writers have created a cop show with stories and characters unlike any other.  ""Blue"" goes to some dark places.  As such, it emerges as so much more than a cop show.  It is a fascinating character study of tragic heroes and flawed souls; good people and their problems.  In other words: human beings.

""NYPD Blue"" may not be just another cop show, but it never forgets it is a cop show.  Where the characters and their issues are always front and center the writers never forget to give us compelling cases, interesting mysteries and criminals that range from brilliant, to diabolical to insane, to comical.  Sometimes this can be said of the fellow officers as well.  In season 3 there are a handful of memorable cases:  the guy who stabs women from outside their apartments and calls breasts balls, Simone and Sipowicz try to figure out how an East Indian woman was murdered inside her locked car, which gives way to some hilarious theories on Andy's part, based on his racial ignorance, a guy tries to play insane so Sipowicz must lock himself in a cell with the guy, pretending to be a fellow crazy (a cannibal no less) to get him to drop the act and confess, and while bugging a mob joint Sipowicz and Simone rob the place so the gangsters don't know there were cops there putting in a bug.  This season also has a memorable episode in which two babies are shot during a robbery but the mother survives.  Sipowicz, already on edge with the combination of Russell's drinking and not telling him, Silvia's pregnancy complications and now this heartbreaking case, clashes with Simone - the two nearly come to blows.

Yes, this and all the other emotional drama is just another day for the tormented cops on ""NYPD Blue.""

It is impossible to over-rate this show.  When it first started, it may not have seemed that way.  Many may have resisted it based on all the hype.  Years later ratings began to decline as the show began to age.  Writer changes and network restrictions in the wake of the Janet Jackson Super Bowl BS may have been the beginning of the show's downward slope.  A few years later, after 12 seasons, the show aired its series finale.  That this once trumpeted series went out with more of a whimper than a bang is unfortunate.  Like, say,  the Rolling Stone's legacy, ""Blue's"" was victim of too much time in the spotlight.  While it is universally recognized as a classic, people started tuning in to other shows; and TV as of late has developed new ""trend"" shows that keep us coming back week after week.  As the landscape changed, ""Blue"" hung around, trying to keep its place, playing mostly to the loyalist fans who would watch every week.  Yet even then, ""Blue"" never sold out.  The last seasons may not have been as great and revolutionary as the first, say, six or seven (still an impressive run), but the show never stooped or pandered to bring in a bigger audience or compete with whatever other cop shows were doing.  The dialog, characters and cases were still laced with a gritty reality and the writers had plenty of good ideas still left in them that gave way to some great story archs.  But much of the language was dialed down, the sex was all but eliminated, Sipowicz had mellowed; no longer a fury in the interrogation room; and an over all feeling of 'been there' with these characters began to set in.  So, the show ended - sadly, but probably rightly so.

The show deserves more attention as a classic and deserves to be remembered as something much more than just an old cop show.  Hopefully with DVD that will be possible.  The 2 and a half year wait between releases, and a step down in quality and quantity of this boxset, compared with seasons 1 and 2, doesn't make me optimistic that Fox will be doing ""Blue's"" legacy proud.  But at least they are back to putting them out.  For those of us who cherish this great series and want to have these season sets around for the rest our lives, it may just be enough.

And if you have never seen the show or always blew it off.  You simply do not know what you are missing.  Even now it holds up.  FX has followed this mold of gritty, realistic drama with shows like ""The Shield"" and ""Rescue Me.""  While those shows, being on cable, have gone even further in terms of sex, language, and violence, ""Blue"" still feels blue.  You can have all the shock value you want, but it will always be more effective when it is smartly written and happens to characters you truly care about.

And that is, and has always been,  ""Blue's"" biggest asset.",1150848000,10,7156,4.5315666406858925
2451253,5,B000BZISRG,"This season really nailed it as far as writing and acting....doesn't get much better. As a fan, my only issue was how they kept screwing around with Justin Micelli's character, Det. Lezniack.  I enjoyed her character in season 2, thought she would progress into a strong female presence and detective, only to be written off as some semi-psychotic jealous maniac who couldn't handle being with a stand-up guy in Det. Martinez. First she's gay, then she's not gay, then she's a jealous raging lunatic? It was just odd to have that thrown into the mix of what otherwise was a great, great, season.

2451254,5,B000BZISRG,"Fans of NYPD Blue have had to wait a long time between the release of Season Two, a number of years ago, and the recent release of season three. But, if the quality of the episodes in season three is taken in to account, it was well worth the wait.

Season two was the season of change on NYPD Blue, with Bobby Simone (Jimmy Smits) taking over as partner to Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz). Season three saw the two actors gel and their characters formed the friendship and the partnership that would last throughout the years.

Season three also saw Franz win his second Emmy award for his portrayal of Sipowicz, the former alchoholic cop, who had been dealt a tough hand in life and often took it out on thugs and perps. In season three, however, things appeared to be turning around for Andy. He got married to DA Sylvia Costas (Sharon Lawrence) at the end of season two, and had struck up a new relationship with his son Andy Jr. (guest star Michael DeLuise), one that continued to blossom in season three. Andy finally appeared happy, with the drinking days behind him and a partner he worked well with. Sylvia became pregnant and gave birth to Theo, making Sipowicz the happiest that any viewer of the show had seen him. It seemed his life was on track.

Then came the brutal murder of Andy Jr. The younger Sipowicz was killed while trying to stop a robbery and assault, just days before he started his job as a police officer, a job that he had been learning from his father. The death of Andy Jr. sent his father over the edge, as he reverted to drinking again and got in fights and was kicked out of his home and the precinct. As the season came to an end, he had found his way back into both after being beaten badly while in a drunk stupor.

Without a question, Sipowicz was one of the best television characters ever created and nobody could've played him better than Franz. He deserved all the acclaim and honors that he received for bringing this character, flaws and all, to life.

For Simone, the year was a better one, at least in many regards. He began a relationship with fellow detective Diane Russell (new series regular Kim Delaney), one that would last until Simone's death a number of years later. Simone made it his personal mission to track down the killers of his partner's son and eventually ended up shooting the suspects in a street shoot out. Delaney's Diane also began the year coming out of the bottle, but was tempted back in when her mother killed her father after a domestic dispute. She stayed away, for the most part, and kept her relationship with Simone intact.

Greg Medavoy (Gordon Clapp) and James Martinez (Nicholas Turturro) began to work a lot more together in the third season, eventually leading up to the pair being partners. Medavoy's clumsy, stuttering ways and Martinez's cool, hip style were complete opposites, but the pair clicked and their partnership was settled. Medavoy saved Martinez's life when he was shot in the season opener and the two helped to provide some small comic relief in many of the episodes throughout the season.

Lieutenant Arthur Fancy (James McDaniel) is in charge of the 15th precinct and has his hands full with his unique group of detectives. A big moment for him is his argument with Sipowicz over a racial matter. While the two characters basically have made up by the end of the season, there is always tension between the two.

Donna Abondondo (Gail O'Grady) the precinct's PAA, left the series with two episodes to go in the  year. O'Grady was becoming a star and creator Steven Bocho knew they were going to lose her, so he created a job at Apple Computer in California, where the lovely Ms. Abondono headed. Her character was eventually replaced by John Irving (Bill Brotchrup), who makes a number of guest appearances in this season.

The final main character was Detective Adrienne Lesniak (Justine Miceli). This was her only credited season on the show, though she had appeared in many episodes as a guest star in season two. She battles thoughts of homosexuality early in the season, but eventually enters a relationship with Martinez, but her jealousy rears its ugly head, breaking up the relationship as the season draws to a close.

This set has two solid commentary tracks, as well as three featurettes, one on the season in general, one on the relationship between Andy and Andy Jr. and one on the women of NYPD Blue.

The only drawback to this set is the packaging. The first two seasons had great packaging, with six discs and a great case to hold them. This season has four double-sided discs with slim cases. I imagine this was a cost issue and quite possibly, if this change hadn't been made, we may never have seen Season Three at all, so really, I can't complain too much about that.

All told, this is a fantastic set and I blazed through the whole thing in a weekend. The stories are riveting, the characters are engaging and the show is addictive, just as it was when it was on network television every Tuesday at 10 p.m.",1144108800,38,5027,4.603351955307263
2451255,3,B000BZISRG,"Has anyone else noticed that there are some audio sync problems on the season 3 DVD's?  I just watched the episode ""The Backboard Jungle,"" and the sync was horrible.  It's not consistent throughout, but at certain points the lips are moving several frames behind the audio.

Not thrilled that they changed up the packaging, since it's nicer to have consistency for a complete collection, but as long as they'll release the DVD's I'm willing to deal with that.

The audio problems aside, the content is still great.",1143244800,6,514,4.873563218390805
2451256,5,B000BZISRG,"As anyone who is familiar (or a fan) of NYPD Blue knows, David Caruso left the series at the end of Season 1! Yet there he is in the description of the long-awaited Season 3!  Mercy sakes! As one who finally watched the show on TNT while healing a back fusion surgery and fell big-time for Bobby Simone, as played by Jimmy Smits, I do wish your info people would at least try to get it right. I watched 10 hrs a week and still think of it as the best written cop show ever, even passing Homicide. So get it right, OK?",1142899200,6,517,4.019417475728155
2451257,5,B000BZISRG,"At long, long last, season 3 has been released. Fans of the show must have been worried that we were only going to get seasons 1 and 2, but with some trimming of costs, Fox have done the right thing, and joy of joys, season 4 cometh also!

Anyway, the best cop show ever moves onwards. We get the continued growth of the Simone-Sipowitz dynamic, with Jimmy Smits a perfect foil for Dennis Franz's more abrasive character. The shows are nothing less than consistently good, the acting superb, and our belief in the souls of the leads holds up. The finale of the season sees tragedy unfold in Sipowitz's life, and his subsequent fall from grace and struggle back again is compelling. As for Simone, he continues to evolve, and this is in fact Jimmy Smits' first entire season in the show. My only slight problem with the show is probably my British ear finding some of the dialogue a bit un-natural.

  So now we wait for season 4, and if the sales there do well enough, season 5 will follow. My copy of season 4 is on pre-order already, so I'm doing my bit!

  One beef. The packaging for seasons 1 and 2 was superb, but the season 3 has been tweaked for cost issues no doubt. Now if that's the price we have to pay to get this superb show released then it's a price I am willing to pay. It's just a pity though, it doesn't look anywhere near as good on my shelf beside the first two box sets. For shame Fox!",1142553600,2,1407,4.2669172932330826
2451258,5,B000BZISRG,"Set aside the great eposodes I'm a little dissapointed with the Dvd itself. For one thing the first and second seasons were in a nice six disc box set. The third season has four double sided discs, packaged very differently from the two previous seasons. Although the third season does very nice special features;three very interesting documentaries and two audio commetaries. My favorite eposode was E.R. in which James Martinez gets shot. The two highlights of the season are when Sipowitz gets a new son and sadly when Andy Jr. is killed. The last two eposodes show Sipowitz relapsing into alcoholism, which he quickly recovers from. This is a must for any fan of unbelieveablely good television",1141430400,,698,4.9743589743589745
2451259,5,B000BZISRG,"I'm one of those who could not care less about extras and overall packaging issues.  Obviously, the extras have been minimized and the packaging simplified, including the use of double-sided discs, which can be irritating.  But I didn't think the extras on Seasons 1 and 2 were all that great to begin with.  If cutting down on the extras and packaging is what it takes to get the sets out, then by all means cut them down.  On the other hand, I haven't noticed that the simplified packaging resulted in any reduced price. I paid about the same as I paid for the other two sets - high $20s..

The big issue for me - which nobody seems to have cared about - was the menu system.  The menu system on Seasons 1 & 2 were frustratingly slow. It took forever to get to an episode and get it started.  I was waiting with baited breath to see if any improvements were going to be made.  Luckily, there is some improvement.  The menu system is significantly faster than the previous seasons.  Gone are the fancy cutscenes from the episodes that slowly scrolled down the screen as you moved down the episode list.  Gone also is the musical accompaniment on the menu system.

Bottom line is:  the audio and video quality are just fine.  (...)

Season 3 indeed was the beginning of NYPD Blue's ""golden age"".  Lets hope we get the rest of the Simone years on disc at least...",1140998400,6,1362,4.409638554216867
2451260,3,B000BZISRG,"Big NYPD Blue Fan. Have 1 and 2 and love them. Just got Vol 3, and think a bad job was done in production. Why the change from dolby 4.0 to dolby 2.0.? Having sound only coming out of my front left and right rear speaker leaves something to be desired. Also the video quality appears grainy to me. Season three is great from the story aspect, but that's about it. Note to Fox: I'll be happy to pay a few more bucks for the former quality.",1140998400,4,438,4.045977011494253
2451261,5,B000BZISRG,"Yes, Series 3 has been finally released albeit in a cheaper, more budget friendly, package and it is critical that fans support this show by buying the sets as they appear.  Fox is releasing Season 4 in June, but thereafter will only release Season 5 if dvd sales warrant new sets.  In other words, they are giving this series a second chance after the low sales for Seasons 1 & 2.

Fox has slashed the number of extra features and even though the set for Season 3 has all the episodes, the whole thing does not feel as important or 'weighty' as the sets for Season 1 & 2.  The featurettes are not specially produced but are older promos from Bochco Productions updated with newer segments by the creator himself.  The number of episode commentaries has dropped from six each for Seasons 1 & 2 to just two for Season 3.  It is clear that Fox has dropped the budget for the sets due to the poor sales of the fully featured Season 1 & 2 boxsets.  However, this also means that the sets are cheaper and as such perhaps more fans will purchase the forthcoming seasons.",1140739200,11,1064,4.370558375634518

Since it came out, television has been inundated with cop shows, but what makes Blue stand out is its substance, character development, and gritty real-ness. Nothing about it is cheap or gimmicky, which can't be said about so many shows out there (cop shows or not). The chemistry between the characters, but especially Sipowicz and Simone, is incredible.

The good news according to TVShowsOnDVD.com is that the studio is reporting that they are already hard at work on Season 4 and unofficially, they are hoping to release it in May or June of 2006.

Starting with the third season, everyone seemed to fit together perfectly and the show developed a power and cadence that few series ever achieve.  It's very easy to see why Dennis Franz won his second emmy this season - he's nothing short of brilliant.

8094843,5,B000BZISRG,"The third season of ABC-TVs long-running series NYPD Blue (1995-96) continues the tradition of superb police drama established during the initial season. This was the first full season with Jimmy Smits playing Detective Bobby Simone. There are budding romances between Simone and Detective Diane Russell (Kim Delaney) and between Detectives James Martinez (Nicholas Turturro) and Adrienne Lesniak (Justine Miceli); meanwhile, Detective Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) and ADA Sylvia Costas (Sharon Lawrence) settle into married life, and tragedy strikes close to home for Sipowicz, causing him to resume some of his former bad habits. Throughout the 15th Squad detectives many personal travails, they must work to solve a myriad of tough, difficult criminal cases that cross their desks every week.

Theres very little I can add to the steady stream of high praise that the first three seasons of this show has received. Every episode features a superbly written story thats taut, tense, grittily realistic, and acted to perfection by every cast member.

Both the 6-DVD set and the streamed video from Amazon are technically excellent, with top-notch video and audio quality. Episodes are shown in their original 4:3 aspect ratio. Video is clean, crisp, sharp, and imbued with vivid natural colors. Audio is in the original 2-channel stereo format thats also clean and bright.

NYPD Blue is the very first TV series I ever bought on DVD.  Since then, Ive watched it many times and have always derived tremendous entertainment from it.  Highly recommended.",1520121600,,1552,5.344262295081967
