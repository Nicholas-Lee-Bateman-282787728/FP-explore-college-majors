4314445,5,B004B93RBU,"Fantastic, really well done.  I used to have to read books to get this kind of images; it is so nice to have them on DVD, now.  Thanks to NG for putting out a really good presentation.",1341273600,3,184,3.945945945945946
4314446,5,B004B93RBU,"This series is a very entertaining and educational look at Ancient Rome.  Although it does not cover all of Roman history, it does hit on some critical points and is a good addition to any collection.",1335225600,,200,4.555555555555555
4314447,1,B004B93RBU,"Presumably someone at the National Geographic HQ knows the difference between the Acropolis in ATHENS, GREECE and the remains of the Forum in ROME, ITALY right? Perhaps not. A shot of the Greek ruins on a DVD claiming to contain a history of ancient Rome can only bode ill for the veracity of the contents of the disc. Please correct this mistake NG!",1330646400,12,350,4.571428571428571
4314448,5,B004B93RBU,"I used this series for an 11 year old who would rather do anything than his homework. He is studying Roman history and utilizing Nat Geo perked his interest. TV is always more fun than the books at 11. Once his interest was there, he took off more willingly with his history homework. It was also something that we could watch together. I found it interesting as well. I am a fan of Nat Geo in general.",1328745600,3,402,4.233766233766234
4314449,3,B004B93RBU,Typical National Geographic take on history. Lots of background info but not much on how people actually lived day to day. I was looking for more in depth study of everyday live and politics of that time.,1325289600,7,204,4.54054054054054
4314450,5,B004B93RBU,"This ""made for television"" production is a dynamic introduction to the realities of the establishment, rule and colapse of the Roman empire.  The visuals are amazing but the commentary throughout the entire series by various scholars makes the series valuable.  It is filled with ""wow"" moments and explains must that we in American culture in the 21st century has either forgotten or chosen to ignore.

Worderful for anyone who wants to understand and for those who would desire not to repeat disaster.",1323734400,8,502,5.097560975609756
4314451,1,B004B93RBU,"I am very disappointed in National Geographic for this product. Very cheaply done, a lot of replays of the same scenes throughout the vidios. With all the history available for the Roman Empire its like they were choosing to tell us what they thought we wanted ie, Gladiators, it left a lot and I mean a lot of questions that I was hoping to get answered. Who wants to hear about one of the most disapointing emperors of Rome with Caligulu, when you can talk about many many more leaders who people don't know about. I can think of many others who will tell how Rome cracked the eggshell out of the normal Roman small country and taking Veii, the first foreign territory taken from the Etruscans.",1316217600,13,696,4.488188976377953
4314452,4,B004B93RBU,"FYI, this DVD contains 6 parts plus a bonus part.  The original National Geographic special, and the DVDs sold on its website, contains 8 parts.  This version is missing two episodes.  I was not aware of this and will be returning it.  I took one star off for the omission.  I've viewed parts of this series on the National Geographic channel, however, and it is great and deserves the other stars.",1311206400,55,398,4.549295774647887
4314453,4,B004B93RBU,"`When Rome Ruled' is a 3 disc set with 2 episodes on each. They include; Secrets of the Gladiators, the Real Caligula, Doomsday Pompeii, Killing Caesar, Birth of Rome, and Ancient Superpower. Each has English subtitles.

The first, Secrets of Rome is more about the coliseum and some little known facts, such as, Rome was one of the last cities to build a stone structure to house their games because they didn't trust their citizens to gather in large groups, also how the coliseum would have been filled with water. On the other hand, they tell about the wonderful emergency evacuation system, but never even hint at how it would have worked.

Doomsday Pompeii purports itself to be the never before told story of the common people, which is a bit of an exaggeration.
Birth of Rome is also a slight misnomer, it really tells how Caesar constructed many of Rome `s structures (the city was already built) and how the city was controlled by Caesar Augustus after Caesar is murdered, the building of the aqueducts and turning a city of brick into marble. Hadrian's rule is mentioned, but nothing of his most famous work Hadrian's Wall.

There are extras and a bonus program' Treasure Seekers' much of which consists of close ups of carvings and a montage of information that it seems couldn't have been fitted in elsewhere.
`In the Shadow of Ancient Romeis not captioned and the volume is much softer than the rest of the programs.

For all of these episodes they have the usual talking heads - historians giving their opinions and facts; however all of them had the extremely irritating habit of looking off to the side of the camera, as if they are staring at someone to the left or right. Some scenes, such as people strolling through villas, adjusting their tunics, eating and reclining in their villas are used  multiple times in every episode.
This is, in total though is a very good lesson on Rome.",1310860800,40,1904,4.7057057057057055
4314454,5,B004B93RBU,"I am fascinated by ancient Rome and I am also a longtime documentary buff, so when I accidentally came across this set of discs on Amazon at a reasonable price I bought it without hesitation. I expected that a series with National Geographic's name on it would be a cut above and I wasn't disappointed. After all, it was they who first introduced me as a child to the ancient world in articles about Abu Simbel and the Bayeaux Tapestry.
This is a very good six part 270 minute documentary and I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in this subject, or who just likes good, entertaining and informative documentaries. They have done a good job of walking a line between making a lively and entertaining TV show about the Roman world, and an intelligent treatment about this amazing civilization that informs so much of the modern western world. When I saw titles like ""The Real Caligula"" and ""Secrets of the Gladiators"" I thought it might be just a rehash of series like ""Rome: Power and Glory"" which aired some years ago on I believe the History Channel, but this series is more informative, with discussions of current archaeology and interviews with scholars like Andrew Wallace-Hadrill and many others, and visits to places I've always wondered about but have never seen pictures of, such as Tiberius' villa on the island of Capri.
They seem to have spent more than the usual amount of money for a TV documentary, creating a look that almost rivals that of HBO's dramatic series ROME, with street scenes and convincing recreations of ancient homes and gardens. I was impressed with the attention to detail and realism, such as when the victorious gladiators hold their palm branches in the air in victory in an exact reenactment of a scene from a well-known graffiti from Pompeii. As you'd expect from the National Geographic, there is a lot of beautiful wide angle photography of ancient locations around Italy, allowing me to see sites I missed in my two visits there.
I would have liked more detailed information than what they provided in a number of instances because hey, I'm an ancient Rome junkie and I always want to learn more. They probably knew however that if they got too scholarly, people would be grabbing their remote controls all over the country and switching to ""Pawn Stars"". They seemed reluctant to mention the names of some of their sources, such as Suetonius, the ""National Enquirer"" of the ancient world. But there was still plenty here to hold the attention of someone like me with a deeper interest in the subject.
I got the regular dvd version of the show rather than the blu ray version, but it still looked excellent on my 40"" LCD television, and the conventional format will allow me to watch the show on any device.
I believe that almost anyone would find this an entertaining and educational addition to their dvd collection, and would recommend it.",1302652800,152,2897,4.75
4314465,5,B004B93RBU,We bought this to help with my child's high school history curriculum.  I had watched this on NATGEO a few years ago and we enjoyed it just as much.  Blu-Ray quality is excellent.,1395446400,,179,4.393939393939394

4314467,5,B004B93RBU,I was watching this series on tv and recorded it. I found it on Amazon at a great price so decided to purchase it. I love programs about ancient Rome and these programs are very well done.,1383696000,,188,4.108108108108108

4314469,5,B004B93RBU,"This is a must have for the history buff. You get three discs of stone cold Roman history, I think my favorite was
the secrets of the gladiators. It is a detail rich overview of a great civilization. I myself have watched it again and
again",1381017600,,240,4.239130434782608
4314470,3,B004B93RBU,"It provided the information in the dullest possible terms.  I love history, but found myself increasingly annoyed at the National Geographic way of presenting it.  The story of the founding of Rome, its insatiable ambition, its lust for power, its expanding empire and its pervasive influence on Western culture is too important to be consigned to ineffective drones.",1376784000,2,367,5.310344827586207
4314471,1,B004B93RBU,"I have National Geographic documentaries that I like and some I don't like, but When Rome Ruled is the worst. My main complaint is the lack of organization. We see hundreds of so-called ""experts"", some of whom are just labeled  ""Historian"" or from the famous University of Cincinnati or the great University of Southern Maine. Maybe I could find someone from Sacramento City College who could give another opinion.  There is no expert who summarizes what the others are saying. Too many cooks spoil the broth.
There is no apparent order to the documentary. It begins with Secrets of the Gladiators, then goes to The Real Caligula, then Doomsday Pompei. On disc two we get Birth of Rome. Why not put that one on disc one?
I learned more about Rome in the Ridley Scott movie Gladiator and Woody Allen's movie To Rome With Love.
Finally, this is a blu-ray. It is the worst looking blu-ray I have seen. I have seen DVDs that look better. I have been spoiled by watching History Channel blu-rays: e.g. The Universe and How The Earth Was Made, which are well organized and look great.",1360281600,4,1078,4.638743455497382

4314473,2,B004B93RBU,"To me this dosen't seem to be up to NG's normal standards.  Throughout the three DVD's they re-use many of the scenes over and over again.  This isn't a comprehensive history of rome just the same old Julius, Caligula, Pompeii, Brutus stories told over again and not very well.",1359504000,2,277,4.63265306122449
4314474,4,B004B93RBU,"National Geographic has produced some excellent DVD's on various subject matter. This is a good example of their work. However, for the most part if you have studied ancient Rome or other films on the subject of Rome you will pick up little in the way of new material. For example, we all know that Caligula was a mad emperor, what caused him to go mad or speculation on the type of disease he had is not that exciting.
There is a pull out flyer inside the box with the DVD's that I found to contain some interesting facts it's worth the read. Over all if you have seen other films on Rome you can pass on this one. If you are just starting to look at Rome in its past glory you might want to add this one to your collection of past empires.",1344729600,9,741,4.117241379310345

8421720,4,B004B93RBU,"This DVD features six 45-min segments on Rome.  They vary in quality of content.  Among the ones I enjoyed were the ""Birth of Rome"" (which oddly appears on the 3rd disc), ""Secrets of the Gladiators,"" and ""Doomsday Pompeii.""  These covered more breadth and depth than some of the other, narrower topics that became repetitive in content and visuals.  For example, ""Killing Caesar"" repeatedly shows the same video clips of Caesar being crowned and Caesar being stabbed.  The material on the Caesar segment did not flow well and could have devoted more attention on the span of events over his life rather than placing so much emphasis on the final period of his life.  Similarly, ""The Real Caligula"" was very disorderly and repeatedly showed the same clips of Caligula and his uncle Claudius laughing obnoxiously.

Visually, I found the material a bit distracting to consume as the clips were quite brief and therefore jumped around a lot.  This was nothing like my experiences watching National Geographic on TV.

Overall, I'm pleased with this set but it's not to the standards I would expect from NG.",1427587200,,1101,4.940217391304348

8421722,4,B004B93RBU,"It's okay for a light history lesson, but one should expect more from National Geographic. I think we all want to overlook the fact that this civilization was highly successful until infected by what we call religion. It might be helpful to note that the Romans had not discovered the capacity for murdering each other in the name of the same god (s). And yet, somehow, well, just look at what they accomplished. Not very easy to admit that actually, they were much more advanced than we are, is it?",1409184000,3,499,4.555555555555555
