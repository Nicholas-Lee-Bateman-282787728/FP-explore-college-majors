8084606,5,B000BBOV12,This item arrived promptly in perfect condition - it is something I have been looking for for a long time.,1307318400,,106,4.35
8084607,2,B000BBOV12,"If you read the fine print (by enlarging the image) on the front of the
movie's cover, you'll see that the real James Dean isn't actually in this
movie. It says ""Michael Brandon"" is James Dean! Oh really?
What kills me is that in the product information it says that James Dean is starring in this movie (or one of them). That's a clerical error by some numbskull who couldn't care less and wouldn't know James Dean from
Martin Sheen! Some young pup born yesterday working on the product description, no doubt! But don't you fall for it!
Of course, if you want to see another actor pretending to be James Dean, that's your call.",1213488000,,628,4.469565217391304
