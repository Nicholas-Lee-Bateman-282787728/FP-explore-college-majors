1715400,5,B000067IXQ,"WOW!!! THIS VIDEO WAS GREAT! NOT STUFFY OR JUST LOADED WITH A BORING BUNCH OF TALKING HEADS, THIS SHOW MOVED ALONG AT A BRISK PACE AND REALLY DELIVERS WHAT IT PROMISES! A REAL MAN'S MAN, JOHN FIORE (GIGI) FROM BOTH THE ""SOPRANOS"" SERIES AND ""LAW & ORDER"" MAKES A PERFECT TOUR GUIDE ALONG WITH HIS ITALIAN GIRLFRIEND, MARIE. TOGETHER THEY TAKE YOU ALONG TERRIFIC VISITS TO TONY'S HOUSE, THE PORK STORE, LIVIA'S HOME, THE REAL BADA BING WITH THE ULTRA SEXY REAL STRIPPERS AND MUCH MORE.(BY THE WAY, THE ""GIRLFRIEND"" MARIE IS ALSO PRETTY HOT HERSELF).  IN ADDITION, THERE IS PLENTY OF RARE FOOTAGE FEATURING THE SOPRANOS ACTUALLY SHOOTING SCENES ON THE STREETS OF NEW JERSEY! THIS SHOW IS LOADED!!! INTERVIEWS WITH CAST MEMBERS INCLUDE WITTY COMMENTS FROM BIG PUSSY, RICHIE APRILE AND OTHERS....THE COUPLE WHO OWN JOHNNY SACK'S HOUSE WERE DELIGHTFUL AND THE BLOOPERS WERE BOTH SHOCKING AND HILARIOUS AT THE SAME TIME! I FOUND THIS DOCUMENTARY TO BE MORE ENTERTAINING THEN WATCHING MOST OF THE 4th SEASON EPISODES!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR THE SOPRANOS FAN.",1043107200,5,1051,4.971590909090909
1715401,5,B000067IXQ,"I thought it was very entertaining and I LOVED both the host John Fiore (GIGI) and his ""girlfriend"" and the way they played off each other and introduced all the rare Sopranos film clips, and toured all the shooting locations especially the Soprano House.
Seeing the original pork store, Centanni's, was quite interesting
and the trip to the Bada Bing sensational!!!!!
The footage of Gandolfini at the House trying to get the ducks into the pool was a riot and the scenes and interviews with Vincent Pastore were great! The footage of the cameraman falling down when the big card game robbery scene was shot was priceless. The Bloopers were hilarious especially the scenes of Tony taking those falls over and over again and the scene of the dog coming in and jumping up on Tony and Carmela in the cemetery.
There is something for every Soprano fan in this video!",1035244800,3,862,4.71523178807947
1715407,2,B000067IXQ,"As a Sopranos avid fan, I was very excited to recieve this DVD as a gift.  From the moment I pressed play and John Fiore's ""comare"" Marie emerged from the limo, I wanted to throw my remote at the TV...ANYTHING to make her STOP TALKING!  The reason I gave any  stars at all was because they did cover basically all the sets from The Sopranos and gave some backround information.  They also had some interviews from cast and crew members.  If it wasn't for that, I would have turned it off, because Marie's overacting of an Italian girlfriend and her horrible nasally voice and excessive whining made me want to go ""whack"" someone!",1201219200,,629,4.530973451327434
1715408,1,B000067IXQ,"Like one of the other reviewers of this DVD, I'm someone who will stay with almost any DVD I put in the player through to it's conclusion.  I just couldn't do it with this overacted, uninformative, almost-never-amusing, strictly-amateur video.  There were a handful of mildly entertaining bits (seeing the real ""Soprano House,"" the revelation that people call Pizzaland from all over the country to order Sopranos pizza, and a couple of fan videos shot on location) but perhaps enough to make a 10-minute featurette.  This is primarily a drive around northern NJ to look at various Sopranos locations and sometimes talk with the owners of those locations.  Through lame jokes, uninformed interviews and an almost total lack of reference to what those locations look like in the actual series, the director manages to make that much less interesting than you'd think it might be.

Left at that, this might have been a ""not-bad-to-have-on-in-the-background"" type of fan-based documentary.  But they try to pull it together by having John Fiore and a bimbo girlfriend have such exciting between-scense banter as ""Oh, Johnny...NOW can we go shopping?"" If Fiore's acting had been this bad when he appeared in the actual series, he'd have been whacked after one episode.  And he's a positive delight compared to his ""Marie"" who, if this is any indication of her abilities, couldn't get a part in a high school production of Annie.

Some other reviewers have characterized this as ""hip,"" and ""tongue-in-cheek"" but I see no evidence of the self-awareness this production would require to be a succesful parody of anything.

If you want background information on The Sopranos, get one of the behind-the-scenes book (HBO's own ""The Sopranos - The Book"" is a very entertaining read with some great photos).  Save your money and don't buy this DVD.  If someone gives it to you, return it (or at least save yourself 2 hours by throwing it away)",1181606400,8,1931,5.003125
1715409,1,B000067IXQ,"As a huge sopranos fan, I thought this would be worth the $10.  Good lord was I wrong! horrible quality, bad host, and THE most annoying woman I have ever seen. Don't waste your money.",1162684800,5,184,4.257142857142857
1715410,1,B000067IXQ,"When I put on a video I almost always watch the whole thing, even if it takes me a few sittings.  But for this one, I stayed with it less than an hour and gave up.  It is pretty awful.

The title Sopranos Unauthorized made me think that there would be some interesting and revealing things about the show.  There aren't any of those.  It is mostly just looking at locations, like Pizzaland, or the Sopranos home in North Caldwell, or Satriale's pork store.  It's like taking one of those boring tours of stars homes.  I've never done that and never will.

What's worse, there's a lot of what passes for comedy but is really unfunny.  Someone plays the dizzy ditz, and she isn't the least bit funny or entertaining.  She just plays a caricature, and it isn't worth watching.

This is one of the worst videos you can get on Amazon.",1156896000,5,829,4.3881578947368425
1715411,5,B000067IXQ,"I really enjoyed this tongue-in-cheek documentary...it was mesmerizing seeing VINCENT PASTORE talk about his death on the show...DAVID PROVAL talking about the real SOPRANO HOUSE used during filming...the HOME MOVIES with JAMES GANDOLFINI shot at the SOPRANO HOUSE were a hoot!!...really really cool scenes shot during the filming of the pilot...and BLOOPERS!!! NOTHING LIKE THIS IS ON ANY OF THE HBO DVDS!

Among other things, a real standout is a trip to the Actual BADA BING (A.K.A. Satin Dolls) used in the show with the REAL girls that appear in the series.

This show is really for the true SOPRANOS fan and they will appreciate all the effort and details that went into it...The footage assembled that was shot by some of the fans at the actual shooting locations is amazing.

For some reason DAVID CHASE and HBO don't shoot ANY Behind-the-Scenes stuff at all, but you will find it here shot by third party bystanders!

Almost every main shooting location is explored with the help of JOHN FIORE (Who played Gigi for 2 seasons on the Sopranos) and his hot Italian Girlfriend, Marie. I think they do a great job hosting and are hilarious in the show! POSITIVELY RECOMMENDED!",1133136000,3,1180,4.885
1715412,2,B000067IXQ,"Two people give us a tour of the locations where the soprano's were filmed.  Pizza parlors, the Bada Bing club, the restaurants, the pork meats store.  Current owners are introduced.  Some footage of poor quality videos made by fans that filmed some of the shoots have been made available for this production.  But the overall quality of the content, and post-production, is quite low.  It could have been made into a much better production.",1122508800,14,441,4.905405405405405
1715413,1,B000067IXQ,"The subject matter and amateur film footage leant itself to a fun documentary, but the ""host"" & ""hostess'"" were unfunny & annoying.

The same raw material could have been turned into something decent, even with the same host but not his ridiculous companion), by a competent documentarian.",1109203200,17,289,5.148936170212766
1715414,3,B000067IXQ,"Don't raise your expectations too high for this poorly-made, B-acted documentary. But those details are exactly what makes it enjoyable to watch. Some of the behind-the-scenes details are memorable, especially the Satriales Pork Store facade and the pizza shop montage. John Fiore hams it up throughout, and goofs on himself in the process, but doesn't take himself too seriously and ruin the mood. Overall, good stuff for the diehard Sopranos fan, but don't expect Jimmy Gandolfini or Edie Falco memorable moments to show up much on this production.",1052352000,12,550,5.261363636363637
1715415,5,B000067IXQ,"This video tour was awesome! The making of the show in a nutshell.
Real cool video footage that actually shows how some of the scenes and effects on the show all come together, The actual locations visited and footage shot by the fans was just great!
I never knew that almost every place in the show is a real location. Tony's home and the real Bada Bing were a blast. The Bloopers were unbelievable! THIS WAS A VERY ENJOYABLE SHOW FOR ANY SOPRANOS FAN. The host John Fiore and his sexy girlfriend Marie, worked well together and guided us thru a first rate trip of SOPRANOMANIA.",1043366400,4,579,4.471698113207547
7962830,3,B000067IXQ,"A behind the scenes look at some places and spaces shown in the beloved series. The facts are pretty interesting - like an inside look, but its kitschy and a little annoying how they put on show - I  was pretty annoyed and wish that chick wasn't in it. We don't need the gangster/mobster cliche to the extremes - we watch the show. They should just stick to the fun facts and leave it at that.",1525651200,,393,4.171052631578948
7962831,2,B000067IXQ,Many interesting facts but the the ditzy woman was so annoying I couldn't continue watching,1515974400,,91,5.133333333333334
7962832,1,B000067IXQ,"Unwatchable!  I love The Sopranos, but this is truly so bad it is unwatchable!  This is very obviously a very poor attempt by somebody to cash in on the success of The Sopranos.  Most of the DVD consists of mindless blabber between the host, John Fiore, and his ""girlfriend"".  The ""girlfriend"" is quite possibly the most obnoxious and untalented woman to ever find her way onto a DVD.  Her mindless and winey blabber is more than anyone can stomach!  I had to try to fast forward past her nonsense to try and finish the DVD, but I eventually gave up.  There is a very tiny bit of content that might be slightly interesting to a die hard Sopranos fan, but it's not worth the aggravation of listening to the hosts carry on endlessly.  Just watch the bonus content on the official Sopranos DVDs and you get more than this DVD offers.  This is simply one of the worst DVDs ever created!",1476921600,,882,4.428571428571429
7962833,3,B000067IXQ,"The whole skit thing between the actors wasn't the best, but the places they showed and spoke about was pretty interesting.  I was looking forward to watching more in-depth interviews, so it was a little disappointing not to see them.",1475452800,,234,4.85
