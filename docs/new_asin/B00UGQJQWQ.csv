8706656,4,B00UGQJQWQ,"Well-done silent film with sound effects and singing and some good action scenes. Interesting romance based on historical figures. Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard said, We had faces then. That is truly the case in this film in which the faces of the actors are so expressiveparticularly Corinne Griffith, whose beauty and abilities as an actress are the centerpiece of the film. Very engaging and well worth watching.",1464134400,,420,5.1911764705882355
