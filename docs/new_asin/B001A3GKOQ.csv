8275890,5,B001A3GKOQ,"I bought this DVD mainly because of Yevgeny Kissins dazzling performance of the ""Carmen"" variations as arranged by Vladimir Horowitz. Joshua Bell also gives a riveting performance of the 3rd movement from Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto, observing all the repeats and playing the fast passages staccato, a feat which only Heifitz and a handful of others have ever been able to achieve. The precision and expression of the UBS Verbier Festival Orchestra conducted by Sir Andrew Davis sounded very much like the NBC Symphony under Toscanini, in other words it transcended criticism.

Martha Argerich with Gabriela Montero open with a dazzling account of the ""Paganini Variations"" by Lutoslawski. Missing however was Lang Langs stunning performance of Liszt's 6th Hungarian Rhapsody. Kissin's performance of Liszts Liebestraum #3 was included however, and had gorgeous tone with superb expression (a Kissin trademark).The other works by Ravel, Schumann, Debussy and Bartok were performed with a complete identification between the composers feelings and the artist. Hopefully there will be more Verbier Festival DVD's. It is doubtful that there will ever be a DVD of Horowitz immortal 1968 TV Concert made at Carnegie Hall,because the truly greatest artists seem to be at the mercy of people only interested in making money, when they perform in big cities.

This explains why at the Verbier Festival the greatest artists are truly inspired and uninhibited,like in the Verbier Festival of 2009 Lang Lang played the Tchaikovsky Concerto as well as Horowitz. A feat never before achieved. Since Medici TV recorded all these historic events, hopefully this DVD is a preview of things to come. For those who cant tell the difference between Victor Borge and Vladimir Horowitz, and are therefore solely interested in state of the art demonstration category sound quality, this review will have little meaning.",1316563200,,1899,5.390572390572391
8275891,5,B001A3GKOQ,There will be people that will tear this thing apart piece by piece.  I happened to love every performance.  I recommend it to anyone that loves classical music and watching great artists bring music alive.  The performance of the Debussy Children's Suite by Nelson Freire is gorgeous.  It's very fine musical performances.,1264032000,2,323,5.153846153846154

While there are a lot of big names in classical music on this disc much of the music played were excerpts from longer works much as you would find on a sampler. I would have liked to hear all of the Ravel Violin and Piano sonata and the Schumann Piano Quintet. Certainly having Joshua Bell play only the first movement of the Tchaikovsky Concerto didn't make sense. That was a strange choice for what is primarily a piano festival

The best pieces are Nelson Friere playing Debussy's Cildrens Corner and the two short pieces by Kissin. I would have liked to here more from Helene Grimaud. Nevertheless,all of the performances were well above average.",1242691200,7,832,5.87603305785124
8275893,4,B001A3GKOQ,"For those of you who don't know, the Verbier Festival is one of the premier summer music festivals in Europe. For two weeks every July and August some of the world's greatest musicians gather to make music with each other, often with instrumentalists and singers they've never worked with before. There is also an academy for young musicians who then make up the various orchestras that play for the festival. This disc is a highlights DVD from the 2007 Festival and like most such discs it includes mostly movements but not full works -- with some exceptions -- and showcases such stars as pianists Martha Argerich, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Grimaud, Nelson Freire, Evgeny Kissin, Lars Vogt and Gabriela Montero, violinists Joshua Bell and Renaud Capuon, cellist Mischa Maisky, baritone Thomas Quasthoff, and conductor Sir Andrew Davis.

It begins with Lutoslawski's scintillating two-piano Variations on a Theme by Paganini (yes, THAT theme) with Argerich and Montero. Then comes three lieder from Schumann's Dichterliebe, with Quasthoff accompanied by Grimaud. Lars Vogt plays Schubert's C Major Klavierst&uuml;ck, D946, No. 3. (It must have been broiling hot on the day he played even in the Alps; he's really sweating!) Then come movements II and III from Schumann's Piano Quintet, with Grimaud, Maisky, Capuon, violinist Syaka Shoji and violist Lars Anders Tomter. This is an over the top, extremely expressive performance and one I immediately played again. Some might object to its flamboyance but I loved it.

Nelson Freire then plays the entire Children's Corner Suite of Debussy. My goodness, I hadn't heard him play since he and I were both young men. I had always admired his playing immensely but somehow he had, for me at least, dropped out of sight. This is a performance that is masterly, and both charming and invigorating.

Two violin sonata movements, both played by Capuon: the fierce finale of Bart&oacute;k's Sonata, with Argerich; and the gentle and lovely Allegretto movement from Ravel's Sonata, with Grimaud. I don't think I've ever heard the Bart&oacute;k with more fire. And Grimaud, whom I've not been a particular fan of before, covered herself with glory here and in her earlier accompaniment of Quasthoff and in the Schumann Quintet. What a lovely player!

Then we get two encores -- the end-of-concert flowers are already on the piano! -- by Evgeny Kissin: a brilliantly evocative Liszt Liebestraum No. 3 (the famous one) and Horowitz's Carmen Variations, even more brilliant. Kissin is one child prodigy who has grown into a mature and valuable artist.

The last track is Joshua Bell playing the bejeezus out of the finale of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto with Davis conducting a superb student orchestra. A stirring performance.

In 2007 the internet presence, [...] webcast all the concerts of the Festival. So, if you're interested you might check that website, or the website of the Festival itself -- [...] -- when this year's festival begins on July 17, 2009, and you will be able to hear the concerts as they happen. THAT is what the web is for, at least for us classical music lovers!
