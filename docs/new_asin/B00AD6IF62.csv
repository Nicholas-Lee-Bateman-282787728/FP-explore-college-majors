8550037,3,B00AD6IF62,I have two of these DVD's they are great to use in the off season during the winter months when I have less outdoor activity. Sometimes I play other music to go with my work out on my training bike. I like them because the scenes are long and I notice something different every time I watch them.,1373068800,2,296,4.120689655172414
