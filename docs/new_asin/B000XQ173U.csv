8229092,5,B000XQ173U,"This is an interesting look at the pop machinery at work in the 60s. There are good clips of all the hitmakers from the era, and Chuck Berry is in the odd position of accompanying Gerry and the Pacemakers on one of Chuck's songs. The Jan and Dean segment is out of place. I'm not sure how they fit in to the rest of the scene. I was surprised to see how blatant the sexuality of the dancers was as they dance in the shadows looking almost naked. The dancers seem like they're all jacked up on happy pills. A bizarre document of history to be sure, but some terrific footage of James Brown, Ray Charles, Marvin Gaye, the Supremes, Bo Diddley, and others who were the backbone of the pop culture before the psychedlic era took hold. It's weird to see white artists doing covers of tunes that were made popular by the originals who are in the film elsewhere.
If you can get a copy of this it's worth the effort. The James Brown, Leslie Gore, and Ray Charles moments are terrific.",1227312000,3,976,4.309782608695652
