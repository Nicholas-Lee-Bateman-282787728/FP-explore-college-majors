2609796,1,B000GG4Y64,"I have never seen so much racist PROPAGANDA in one movie. Like honestly this movie offends me to my core. I don't know who came up with this trash excuse for a film, but whoever did needs to be slapped. I got about 50 minutes minutes in. I could not even finish it. It's like the only roles for aboriginal people in Hollyweird are  gangsters, teen moms, drug dealers, maids, and slaves. I'm so OVER it and U.S. movies and television as a whole. Also I'm sick of the media always pairing aboriginal people with caucausoids. I don't have anything against the pale ones, but I'm really tired of the constant interracial nonsense. Especially when the U.S. census and statistics show that the majority of aboriginal people prefer to stick with our own. It would be nice to see a couple with two melanin rich beings portrayed, but that would counter Hollyweird's usually propaganda so of course it doesn't happen. Truly this movie is propaganda through and through and I am simply NOT here for it. I was cringing the whole time watching it. Cringing.",1512432000,,1044,4.643243243243243

2609798,5,B000GG4Y64,"""Save The Last Dance"" drew me into the story. I cared about Sara. I wanted her dreams to come true. The situations were believable, like the scene where Chenille (cute name by the way) tells Sara she's taking one of the few decent men left after jail, drugs, and drive-by. That felt very realistic to me. I couldn't help but imagine that I was in love with a black man and going through the same emotional turmoil as Sara.

I will never know what it's like to be black but it seemed to me that blacks were treated with respect in this film. I came to understand their motives. They were presented as multi-dimensional, real people with feelings. I cared about them, too.

There is a lot to like in Save The Last Dance. We have a female protagonist - the entire story is told from her point of view. Sara's emotional world is always the main focus. She is not window-dressing to make some guy look good. We have interracial romance, treated with sensitivity and respect. There's a scene where Chenille tells Derek ""you can't help who you love"". This is something that LGBT folks know to be true.

I liked the music ... but not the words starting with ""N"". It's a shame that they add to the film's realism. If blacks want the respect of whites, they need to respect each other first.",1510444800,,1281,4.419491525423729

2609804,5,B000GG4Y64,"This movie shows a wide range of social issues of young lower class adults. Within the movie you see them tackle teen pregnancy and the lack of father interaction, criminalization of women, the battle between the gangs and the desire to get out of the ghetto, the desire to fit in and overcome adversity as a white women dating a black man in a time where interracial couples were rare and how the loss of a parent and a new unknown relationship with a father can cause an upset and change in personality.",1508371200,,505,4.440860215053763

2609858,5,B000GG4Y64,"I love this film, its so nostalgic the music the dancing it brings me back to middle school/hs dances, the dancing is good and it has a better storyline than most dance movies especially since its one of the first to use the good girl/ballet dancer meets bad boy who turns out to be a good boy whose just trying to survive and they dance together fall in love, something in his life goes bad, amazing song/dance routine at the end of film formula. Which makes it feel more real then other dance films and for real the soundtrack for this film is just one of the best, captures the time period so perfectly.

2609955,5,B000GG4Y64,"I loved this movie when I was younger. I was elated to share it with my daughter. It had been years since I've watched this movie and I was not let down at all. Julia Stiles is perfect in it. The story is well written and touched on so many issues that exist in the world (ecen though its fictional) without being too over the top. I appreciate that the scenes that ellude to adult situations do not show nudity and I don't find myself needing to sheild eyes in my house!

The music in this movie is great and I have it in my head for days after watching it!

If you have not seen this movie you must! It follows a young girl being raised by her single Mom who is soon killed in a car accident. The young girl is a dancer but is now uprooted to live with her semi estranged father in an urban area where she attens an urban public school for the first time. She finds herself connecting with new friends, opening her mind to new ideas and exploring her own limitations whike trying to work thru her grief.

The strain of competing loyalties to a girl friend, self, and peers on a destructive course is palpable.  The story, while dealing with difficult subject matter was, was enjoyable and hopeful.  I have already watched the movie a second time and purchased it.  I will go back to it periodically.  PGS",1454889600,,493,4.752941176470588

2610280,2,B000GG4Y64,"So, this movie wasn't good. The white girl gets everything in the end. The white girl comes out on top because she steals the moves of her black friends to further her dance career without giving them credit or anything. And Julia Stiles is not a good dancer. Her double was good but that girl was silly and pig-headed and couldn't even get out of her own head and her own tragedy to see the hurt and brokenness of the world she lives in (remember Derek and Chenille's mom has NEVER been around and she got offended when they went off on her and black characters never got to be offended at the way she treated them-Sara never apologized for being insensitive or rude or plain stupid). And why do we have to choreograph and continually depict white people as sterile, boring ballerinas and perfect in their character and morals while we watch the black characters who live in poverty and need and violence. The two worlds juxtaposed need to stop being juxtaposed so that we can one day actually have equality in the races. If we keep depicting race in such a huge hierarchy, we are never going to move past the rich/poor, the fortunate/less fortunate, white versus black. If we keep making movies where black people have no hope to overcome the vast majority of the time, we aren't giving other races a chance at changing their stigmatism and stereotypes. And as a dancer, this film was terrible-even the hip hop was horrible-at least the ballet was decent but let's do our homework on hip hop culture and actually portray their dancing as it is instead of that wishy washy stuff.",1427673600,,1580,4.586572438162544

I tend to like movies where I see growth and transformation in the characters and I liked that the main character challenges the people around her as they challenge her in a new way. She is forced to engage in new things and they are challenged to accept her but as all of this unfolds you see her growing up and her closest friends and meanwhile, she's training to perform her audition at Juliard and you can see her growth just alone in her dance.

I purchased a digital rental of the film and it worked just fine.

I love this story so incredibly much. It's so 90's. It seems like everyone was making a movie about dancers in the 90's back then, but this one is gold, I promise.",1375056000,,247,4.145833333333333
2610445,2,B000GG4Y64,"I was in high school when this movie came out in theaters. I was interested in the trailers, but I never got around to watching it. 12 years later, I decided to buy the DVD. What a waste of $10...

There are so many movies in which black people are portrayed as ignorant thugs. As a black male, this makes me upset. I thought that this movie would be different. After all, the lead character gets accepted to one of the most prestigious schools in the nation. Unfortunately, I was wrong.

I won't summarize the plot since several people already did that. After Sara arrived in the ""urban"" school in Chicago, she was befriended by Chenille. Of course, Chenille had a kid while she was in high school and she spoke in Ebonics. Anyone who has watched Kerry Washington's other movies knows that she is an intelligent and articulate woman. The way they portrayed her character was just wrong.

At first, Derek was Sara's academic rival but they eventually hooked up. What didn't make sense was that Chenille was initially ok with their relationship, but later on in the movie, she complained about a white girl ""stealing"" an intelligent black guy. And even though Nikki clearly started the fight with Sara, Chenille blamed Sara.

Derek's friend was this thug (of course) named Malakai. They both stole money from a liquor store when they were kids, but Derek got away. Malakai didn't snitch on his friend. I wish the movie explained how Derek went from basically committing a felony to attending an elite college. They could've at least showed him studying for the SAT.

This movie made an interracial relationship a bigger deal than it is. They acted like Sara Johnson was the only white girl in the entire city of Chicago. She was experiencing blatant reverse racism. And every black character besides Derek was a stereotypical caricature.

The movie was good up until the scene where Derek and Sara had sex in her apartment. Afterwards, it just became stupid and fell apart. The dance scenes and songs were great. I really wanted to like this movie, but it only perpetuated negative stereotypes about African-Americans. Julia Stiles ought to be ashamed of herself.",1374537600,,2162,4.798387096774194

They take a white girl and move her into an African-American neighborhood, which when I moved with my family that's what happened to me.  In this film, Sara, portrayed by Julia Stiles, loves to dance.  But she recounts the moments leading up to her mother's death, and blames herself for it.  Saying basically that if weren't for her, Sara, that her mother wouldn't have been hurrying and wouldn't have gotten killed.  She finds a friend in Derek who not only assures her that it is in fact not her fault that her mom was killed, but hangs out and becomes close to Sara.  This film has a lot of dancing and a lot of hip-hop.  Overall it was very enjoyable.  I would recommend it.",1342828800,,724,4.311111111111111

2610502,3,B000GG4Y64,"This movie had a lot of scenes that could very easily have become cringe worthy, but they were all handled pretty sensitively. The racial stuff about black and white relationships. I liked the acting, both Julia Stiles and her leading man, Sean Patrick Thomas. The rest of the cast all did a good job, too. I think the weakness of the film was that the hip hop music and dancing is just not very interesting. There wasn't a single memorable song on the soundtrack. I like the ballet sequences and Julia's contemporary dance for her Julliard audition, but the dancing in the club was very lackluster. You got the feeling that dance was something that was important to their community, something that they enjoyed, but it wasn't that great to watch it. I liked the scenes where Sean Patrick Thomas was showing Julia the latest dance styles though because I needed the explanations to understand what the h they were doing. I wasn't seeing it in Steps, the dance club where they would go.

Comparisons: In Saturday Night Fever, the Disco Dancing sequences in the club were exciting. The Bee Gees music was very memorable and in fact the tunes were bona fide hits. STLD songs were throwaways, and dance scenes were not all that.

Both STLD and Flashdance end with a similar dance audition. I think I liked the Julia Stiles audition dance better than Jennifer Beals' but again, throughout the film, the dance sequences and music were much better in Flashdance. If you look at Jennifer's dance to Maniac on the Dance Floor, she is really just running in place with close-ups on her rear. But it works. Julia Stiles is no J Lo in the back end department.

8 Mile was not a dance movie, but it did have rap music. 8 Mile presented a much more solid case for rap than STLD did for Hip Hop. The sound track for 8 Mile was outstanding, with breakout songs from 50 Cent, and some of Eminem's best stuff ever. ""Lose Yourself"" was a really good song. It didn't win a Grammy but I think it did win an Oscar. Fact checkers? I am thinking that happened because at the time I wondered why the Grammies had no love for Eminem when the Oscars did.

In some ways this was about being the only White Girl in a Black High School, or at least about having to fit in at a new High School. There is even the obligatory scene where she goes to the cafeteria and has to figure out where to sit, sits with the nerds, and has to be rescued by Sean Patrick Thomas' sister. Flashback to Mean Girls and maybe even Clueless? Fact Checkers? I had that feeling of Deja Vu all over again, and I bet there are more examples of this type of situation in teen films.

The Black Swan also had ballet as one of the major themes, but in that Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis both really put a lot of time and effort into learning ballet and preparing for their roles. Julia Stiles did OK, though, but not even close to Nat and Mila.

I must say that I think the character of her father was largely wasted. He was supposed to be a jazz musician, therefore he lived in the Black part of Chicago, where of course, the Blacks all support jazz clubs by vigorously staying home in droves or hanging out at Steps. It was a very poorly thought out excuse to get Julia Stiles into the hood. But as long as we had her father supposedly a trumpet player, we could have had her go and listen to him play at least once, or perhaps take Sean Patrick Thomas out to hear him and meet her dad. It makes me mad that jazz is ignored when such a fuss is made over mediocre Hip Hop music. Do these kids even know who Miles Davis is? Sad.

So, The Bottom Line is that it was an OK but not great movie. I might have been comparing apples to oranges, but the weakest aspect of STLD was the lackluster Hip Hop music, and if there is any great genius of Hip Hop out there, STLD was a wasted opportunity to showcase him or her, and both could have benefited from that collaboration.",1322438400,,3910,4.326057298772169

In lesser hands, the writer could have made a hash out of the well-worn themes in this movie, but instead he worked all these themes together into a coherent whole:

  *  The ""teenage coming of age"" movie, like All the Right Moves.

  *  The ""star-crossed young lovers"" movie, like Romeo and Juliet.

  *  The ""forbidden interracial love"" movie, like Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.

  *  The ""guilt over the death of someone close to me will only temporarily stop me from performing"" movie, like Stomp the Yard (I know: Stomp the Yard is a later film).

  *  The ""overcome adversity to get into a top-notch dance school"" movie, like Flashdance.

  *  The ""go to new school with everyone of a different ethnicity than you"" movie, like Finding Forrester (yet another great Sean Patrick Thomas movie).

  *  The ""are you going to follow your gang or not"" movie, like Boyz N the Hood.

  *  And, of course, the ""broken family trying to heal"" movie, like every Disney movie ever made except Peter Pan.",1198454400,,1153,4.762886597938144
2610526,4,B000GG4Y64,"I purchased Save The Last Dance and was disappointed only in some of the scenes that viewed in the movie. Overall it was a great movie. My only beef, is why did they put Julia Stiles in the role to play opposite someone like Sean Patrick Thomas? Julia did really well in the dance scenes, but in the part she played as Sara Johnson, I personally think they should have picked another actress. Why you ask? Simply because to me, Julia did not come across the screen to me as someone who truly was in love with Derek. You know the part she played as Sara. It just didn't seem real to me. The emotion was not there, it's like she was being forced to play at being in love with someone. Teens have strong emotions in those years and her part just didn't seem believeable. Other than that the movie was good and I enjoyed it. I didn't particularly care for Malachi, but the actor playing the part, played it well because you weren't supposed to like Malachi. I am not down on Julia Stiles, I have seen some of her other movies and she always nailed the part like it was supposed to be, but I'm sorry that I can't say the same for this movie. I do want to buy the sequel and soon I will. If you like hiphop and dance scenes this is your movie, as for the love scenes Sara (Julia) didn't make the cut in my point of view. Also, new actress, Kerry Washington did a great job at playing Chenille. I think she has or should have a great future ahead of her.",1194307200,,1447,4.153024911032029

2610528,3,B000GG4Y64,"I actually have liked Julia Stiles in other movies and she tries hard here.  Though I've nothing against her, couldn't they get a dancer to play the lead?  She's so clearly doubled that it's distracting. Thomas is winning as a youthful Sidney Portier lookalike.  They have a nice chemistry, if they had a chance to do more together than this lame, cliche ridden script.  If I were black, though, I'd find this movie offensive as it portrays the majority of black characters as hopelessly tied to failure, except for the one shining light who works his way out of the ghetto and of course, merits a white girl.  The ending is embarassingly ""flashdance"".  The only thing that saved the movie from one star was that I was afraid it would be even more predictable, that the shining light, with his dream in reach,  would get snuffed out in gang violence all in the name of noble friendship, while the girl, inspired by his bootstrappiness, goes on to get her dream.  But thankfully, this is a ""feel good"" movie, so that's the one cliche we didn't get treated to.  Truthfully, I found it a ""feel dumb"" movie -- I felt dumb for wasting my time watching it. OTOH, aside from being a offensively cliche ridden, stereotypical to the point of prejudice riddled chestnut, with snoringly predictable characters and plots, it is reasonably competent as a sort of Flashdance remake. 2 1/2 stars",1191715200,,1380,4.6929460580912865
2610529,4,B000GG4Y64,"Dancing has become a cinematic phenomenon as of late, with films like `Stomp the Yard' and `You Got Served' being churned out of the movie machines like bunnies from the womb, but sadly just about every one of these so called dance films lacks in every department but the dance moves.  Sure these young actors (if you can call them that) can cut a rug but the storylines and overall acting in these productions are downright awful.  Rewind back a few years though and you'll find that not every dancing film is entirely lacking.  In 2001 MTV put out a film called `Save the Last Dance', a film that did quite well and still to this day holds up against the onslaught of inferior copycat films.  What these films lack `Save the Last Dance' embraces.  Sure it has its share of hang ups and set backs for I'm not saying it's perfect but it tries much harder than the films of late and it provides a decent and well rounded script with characters we can care about.

The film follows ballet dancer Sara Johnson as her life is upended by the sudden death of her mother.  To make matters worse Sara blames herself for her mother's death (she died racing to watch her daughter audition for Juilliard) and swears never to embrace ballet again.  She is forced to move in with her father following the death and this changes her life drastically.  Her father is a bit less well off then her mother was and Sara lacks much respect for him.  She also must change schools, and being the proper white girl that she is she finds it very difficult to adjust to a predominantly all black school.  That is until she meets Chenille and her brother Derek.  Chenille welcomes Sara into her circle and shows her the ropes, making her feel comfortable instead of out of place and Derek eventually makes his way into her heart and helps her find her love of dance once again.

The film, while focusing on the dancing, spends equal time fleshing out the characters on the screen.  The cast is an impressive list of young stars, and I think this is another reason this film is far superior to the dance movies of late.  Instead of casting rising musical talents like Chris Brown as the lead this film has a solid cast of young actors who know how to act.  Sean Patrick Thomas is great as Derek.  He embodies his character extremely well, balancing the misplaced loyalty to his childhood friend Malakai with his determination to make his life better than would be expected.  I also really liked Bianca Lawson's performance as Derek's ex-girlfriend Nikki.  She had that perfect mixture of kattyness and sexuality.

And what ever happened to Julia Stiles?  This movie should have made her a star.  I mean sure, I understand that Jessica Alba is physical perfection but the sheer fact that she gets more work than Stiles is a sin against humanity.  As Sara Julia brilliantly delivers emotion after emotion and elevates the film.  I really want to see more of this girl.  But when speaking of the cast there is one name and one name only that resonates forever with me.  Kerry Washington.  As Chenille she is effortlessly entertaining and completely memorable, best in show.  Washington is on the top of my list of my favorite young actors who I crave to see more of.  She has so much talent, so much potential.

The film is not without its low points.  It is a tad bit predictable, well not a tad, and it does fall into the same clichd stereotypes that most films of this nature come into.  Prejudice is addressed, but I actually felt the way it was broached here was a bit refreshing.  It expressed a real concern for the African American community, at least in those city areas, and I felt it was dealt with nicely.  It broaches many concerns of people in those types of communities, whether it be gang violence or single parent families.  This has all been done before.  Regardless it never takes away from the entertainment value of the film.  I still love this film to this day and watch it regularly.  Sure, it's no Oscar winner but it should have served as a foundation for the dancing films that followed.  Sadly it wasn't.",1191283200,,4101,4.542974079126876

There's no real obstacles to overcome-everyone just need to learn to get out of their own way.  Which is usually the case in real life as well.  This is not a bad movie.

2610532,4,B000GG4Y64,"first--despite The  New Yorkers vulgar description of Miss Stiles as  ""The reigning teen queen"" I find her an intelligent  actress willing to take on challenging roles. Second I hope folks have noticed that many of the  ""teen"" remakes of classics--I'm thinking of  Shakespeare and  Jane  Austen --have been quite well done, and often much better than laborious efforts to film the original.

This film ""pace"" the younger sets comments seems to me a thoughtful piece of work. The director is taking on a rather delicate problem--and I don't mean interacial romance. What troubles me in this film is the relationship between the sexes. I want to be careful here because I do not mean to be preaching some ""sexist"" agenda--however I am troubled by the treatment of black men in this film who because of what I regard as  a feminization of the west that began some thirty five years ago--largely for economic reasons men--especially black men (though in this film ironically most particularly a white man) are become economically marginalized.  Another of Miss Stile films--a remake of Taming of the  Shrew makes passing reference to this. Good for her!

2610549,4,B000GG4Y64,"First off, I feel compelled to explain my rating system.  I don't hold all movies to the same standard.  Rather, I rate based on whether I feel the movie has achieved its goal or not.  With this in mind, Save The Last Dance has done very well in being a feel-good dance movie that caters to the young generation without at the same time alienating anybody else who doesn't necessarily fit into the MTV mold.

I think this movie succeeds at being a little of everything; it's hip, it's accessible, it's got comedy and drama, exciting dance routines, it showcases fine acting talents, and, most of all, it's never corny (cliched at times, yes, but not corny).  I think the biggest success of this film was that it incorporated elements of both black and white cultures in a way that was entertaining without being disrespectful.  It's highly watchable -- I watched it with my entire family and we all enjoyed it immensely.

Sean Patrick Thomas steals the show as Derek, the male lead.  He makes a charismatic performance as the young man from the 'hood trying to get into medical school.  His character called for someone who could believably play 1) a boy who grew up in south side and 2) someone intelligent and well-read enough to get into Georgetown to study medicine.  Whether he's hanging out with his friends who aspire to become thugs or debating literature in the classroom, Sean Patrick Thomas pulls off both very believably, which is really what makes his character fly.

Julia Stiles, on the other hand, plays the firecracker Sarah who was an aspiring ballerina until the untimely death of her mother, which causes her to move in with her father who lives on the wrong side of the tracks.  Julia Stiles sparkles in this movie, and it was delightful to see her and Thomas play off each other.

Each of the supporting cast was well cast, as well.  The dancing, too, was hip, exciting, and well-choreographed.  The dances were well-orchestrated exclamation marks to scenes.  MTV doesn't over-reach in this film and that's what made it work.  They knew what they wanted and they did it well.

The genius of this film is the good balances it achieves between so many aspects.  It's cool without alienating non-high schoolers, it's dramatic without being sappy, and it resorts to cliches at times without being corny.  That, combined with the dances and the acting, make this movie a rock-solid feel-good crowd-pleaser.  It's unfair to judge a crowd-pleaser to bio-epics and Oscar-winning dramas and say the former isn't a good movie.  There are different types of movies, and this is one of the better feel-good movies I've seen in a while.",1108080000,,2645,4.779735682819383

2610552,4,B000GG4Y64,"There are some fish-out-of-water elements in this film - Sara Johnson (Julia Stiles) is an aspiring ballet dancer. Her mother dies and she must move from her country town to Chicago to live with her father (Terry Kinney). She finds herself plunged into an alien environment. She's at a high school where the student population is perhaps 95% black, which doesn't trouble her, but she gets a quick introduction to the higher crime rate in a big city - metal detectors at the school entrance... A girl called Chenille (Kerry Washington - excellent performance) looks out for her. The real problem comes when she accompanies her new friends to the local dance club - she discovers that she had no idea of how to dance like they do. Derek Reynolds (Sean Patrick Thomas) takes pity on her, and starts teaching her. This starts some real antagonism between Sara and Nikki (Bianca Lawson); Nikki was already in her face, and now Sara's cosying up to the man she wants.

Derek's best friend Malakai (Fredro Starr) is heading in a different direction - he's just out of jail, and shows every sign of heading back again. Derek wants to become a doctor, and his marks are good enough. Malakai doesn't like the idea of Derek getting close to Sara - it is never completely clear whether this is because of her colour, or because she is encouraging him away from gang-related stuff.

Hmm, maybe the director's right about the interracial romance - a lot of the tensions relate to it. Or maybe it's just about race - Sara gets some strange looks simply from being white in a predominantly black neighbourhood.

Sara is not the archetypal wimp - she is perfectly happy to stick up for herself. That's good.

2610554,3,B000GG4Y64,"This film, while better than I thought and a better effort than other MTV movies, suffers from thing - an old, tired stereotypical, ""blacks have a problem with whites too"" hollywood.

In this day and age where interracial romance is hardly shocking and it seems that it is mandatory for white women to have black guys, this film is bad at the social level.  First, like all films who want to point out the blackness of African-Americans or those of African decesnt(check out any Indian film where the Indian is not as dark as they come, but aby regular blacks are darker than the Indians), this film makes sure that the contrasting character is very dark-skinned.  Why could he not have been light?  They also made sure that he had clear African type features(Bend it like Beckham anyone?).

MTV and it's constant ""happy people"" (the G word) propaganda, has always had a problem with black people.  Why make a film like this?  If anything, make a film about the white parents pretending to accept the black guy.  While some people still dislike race-mixing, it is clearly something that does not shock and is only of issue to neo-nazi minded individuals who need something to keep them in the news.

This film, like TV in general, brings up a race issue at a time when that is not really on peoples' minds.  It always happens.  When everything is calm and ok on the race scene, TV ALWAYS finds new ways to reintroduce it.  If it's not the suttle mentioning of black on the news or in a trial like OJ or Kobe Bryant mentiong race for no reason at all, then it's films like these and ""Bend it Like Beckham.""  In ""Beckham,"" the east Indiand producers made sure that they did not show east Indians at their darkest.  They made sure that their would be a darker, Africna type black to not only contrast (try to show an actual difference between an Indian and black) the Indian girl, but they made sure that they put Inidans on a level with whites.  They even had the girl say "" my parents want me to marry an Indian.  They would be kind of ok with a Muslim or white boy, but definitely not black...""  That is not verbatum, but you get it.

Films like these inject race for no reason other than  to keep it on peoples minds.  If their is not as much tension now as in the past, why create some?  Why try (once again) to show differces?  In ""Beckham,"" their goal was to show that Indians are on par with whites and despite the same skin tones and REAL racial connection(just take a look at the blacks of Asia, including India), that they are not black and do not want to be seen as such.  That was the purpose of such a scene.  It is also the same reason why in ""Missisippi Masalsa,"" they used a dark-skinned Indian (she was looking good!!), but used an even darker black American(Denzel).

This film does nothing but keeps race on the minds of people who may not have it on their mind for the day.  Anyone who knows anything, will know that when thing are ok, they inject race.  In sense, like reminding whites ""you are not supposed to love black people, you are supposed to be hating them!""

The only good and realistic thing about this film is the fact that a black male gets the girl.  They don't like to show that on regular TV or commericals.  Only Hollywood(and still many whites AND even Asian trying to be like whites) still thinks that people have a problem with a black man being the object of women's desire.  They don't mind the interracial thing as long as the black woman is after the white man.  They hardly ever show the white woman or other women after the black man (as in real life) because that would shift the perception power from the white man to the black man.  If you are in power, YOU want to look like the guy people want, not someone else who you have been trying to keep back.  Hollywood rarly relfects reality.  When it comes to interracial romance, they ALWAYS make the story about conflict when it conerns a white woman going after a black man, but hardly ever the other way around.  Those black films of the 70's where Shaft was doing his thing with a white woman was more realistic.",1101168000,,4110,4.397350993377484

This film, like TV in general, brings up a race issue at a time when that is not really on peoples' minds.  It always happens.  When everything is calm and ok on the race scene, TV ALWAYS finds new ways to reintroduce it.  If it's not the suttle mentioning of 'black' on the news or in a trial like OJ or Kobe Bryant mentiong race for no reason at all, then it's films like these and ""Bend it Like Beckham.""  In ""Beckham,"" the east Indiand producers made sure that they did not show east Indians at their darkest.  They made sure that their would be a darker, Africna type black to not only contrast (try to show an actual difference between an Indian and 'black') the Indian girl, but they made sure that they put Inidans on a level with whites.  They even had the girl say "" my parents want me to marry an Indian.  They would be kind of ok with a Muslim or white boy, but definitely not black...""  That is not verbatum, but you get it.

Films like these inject race for no reason other than  to keep it on peoples minds.  If their is not as much tension now as in the past, why create some?  Why try (once again) to show differces?  In ""Beckham,"" their goal was to show that Indians are on par with whites and despite the same skin tones and REAL racial connection(just take a look at the blacks of Asia, including India), that they are not black and do not want to be seen as such.  That was the purpose of such a scene.  It is also the same reason why in ""Missisippi Masalsa,"" they used a dark-skinned Indian (she was looking good!!), but used an even darker black American(Denzel).

This film does nothing but keeps race on the minds of people who may not have it on their mind for the day.  Anyone who knows anything, will know that when thing are ok, they inject race.  In sense, like reminding whites ""you are not supposed to love black people, you are supposed to be hating them!""

The only good and realistic thing about this film is the fact that a black male gets the girl.  They don't like to show that on regular TV or commericals.  Only Hollywood(and still many whites AND even Asian trying to be like whites) still thinks that people have a problem with a black man being the object of women's desire.  They don't mind the interracial thing as long as the black woman is after the white man.  They hardly ever show the white woman or other women after the black man (as in real life) because that would shift the perception power from the white man to the black man.  If you are in power, YOU want to look like the guy people want, not someone else who you have been trying to keep back.  Hollywood rarly relfects reality.  When it comes to interracial romance, they ALWAYS make the story about conflict when it conerns a white woman going after a black man, but hardly ever the other way around.  Those black films of the 70's where Shaft was doing his thing with a white woman was more realistic.",1101168000,,4105,4.4194407456724365

NOTHING in this movie was original or made it special, AT ALL. I mean the characters were good actors, but the movie, whoever made it, couldn't have thought up of his own, had no imagination whatsoever. Movie seemed like it was copied from the MANY MANY movies out there that are similiar. Ahem: Situation such as a crisis in the beginning which is used to bring the audience in and used to create the ""start"" for the movie, a person usually the main character, trying to get use to her new surrounding which does and just like that they become a main attention LIKE ALWAYS, than a problem arise to make the story a bit longer and makes up the body, which is solved. Whats worst is at the end, in which she dances in the front of the judge. She does badly than the boyfriend comes in gives her some confident and boom she does an amazing performance. NO CREATIVITY, NO TWIST AND TURNS, NOTHING SPECIAL. The maker of this movie should be fired immediately, cause all he made was a movie that was thought many times over decades ago...just changed in some key points. I can't possibly understand how any person in their right mind would give this a full 5 stars, even 4 stars seem rediculous!",1100217600,,1375,4.504

This movie is trying too hard to connect with the kids while at the same time attempting to display some emotional depth, while at the same time trying to highlight some real problems in African American culture. Instead of leaving a meaningful impact, it ends up creating mockups of a unique but troubled society. Don't try so hard Hollywood. Make a real genuine movie about the problems of inter-racial relationships OR make a movie about the struggles of under-privileged youth OR make a movie about the struggles of broken families. I like the idea, but the execution is laughable. And Julia, you should loosen up a little and get some soul.

2610558,5,B000GG4Y64,"This movie is a great romantic comedy about a young woman, Sarah, who thinks she has lost everything but in the end realizes she hasn't.  It seems that the young woman starts a whole new life and turns into a different person when she is forced to leave her home in the suburbs to live in the south side of Chicago.

 It seems that she lets the death of her mother take over her mind, body, and soul.  Then when she meets Derrick, one of the boys in her class, he seems to help her overcome her fears and help her start over.  He wants to make her dream come true of attending Julliard, the prestigious dance school in New York City.

 Combining the battle of friendship with romance this movie is unbelievable.  Sarah becomes friends with Chenille and quickly she shows her the ropes of Chicago, bringing her to the club and showing her how to really dance.  Once Sarah sees how the people dance in her new town she wants to learn.  Derrick is quick to jump in and say that he will teach her.

 Eventually their secret meetings of dance turn into romance.  At first no one approves of their love, including Chenille, Sarah's friend and Derrick's sister.  Sarah seems to think that she doesn't need Derrick and she tries to forget about it.",1096416000,,1240,4.405286343612334
2610559,5,B000GG4Y64,"I was actually surprised how moving this movie was!  Since it was produced by MTV, I thought it would be contrived and stereotypical.  Save the Last Dance examines race relations and following the path that truly brings you joy against all odds.

The best elements of the story, by far, was the strong acting by Sean Patrick Harris (as Derek) and Julia Stiles (as Sarah), and the eye popping dance sequences.  They are two young teenagers with big dreams who must both work through obstacles thrown in their path by life while falling in love with one another.  This challenges the views of those around them as Sarah (a white girl) and Derek (a young African-American man) embark on a relationship that transcends their backgrounds.  They are brought together by their mutual love of dance.  While Derek is into hip hop, Sarah casts aside her dreams of attending Julliard as an aspiring ballerina after the sudden and tragic death of her mother, which she blames herself for.

This is a film that can be enjoyed by teenagers and adults.  It isn't too sappy for the older crowd.  Also, I happen to think Sean Patrick Harris (Derek) is not only an engaging and wonderful actor, but is also totally handsome!  Very easy on the eyes, ladies.",1094774400,,1238,4.711627906976744
2610560,3,B000GG4Y64,"A romantic comedy about a young woman who, in the midst of losing everything, finds that she really hasn't. There are plenty of high school romance movies to pick from but few that involve hip-hop dancing.

I have to admit I was a bit disappointed with the turning point in the movie. All romances have a turning point and they're usually some major revelation that makes the rest of the movie. Unfortunately, the acting at this point lost credibility. It didn't ruin the rest of the movie but I would have appreciated it more had this one scene been stronger.

Some of the DVD extras were ok ... barely. I gave up on the director's commentary about a third the way through. Perhaps I expect too much of the director in wanting to actually hear about the scenes in the movie. This fellow spent far too much time talking about himself.

The 'making of' and 'cast + crew' mini-films were worth watching. And the trailer pretty much gave away the movie. The deleted scenes were good though it wasn't entirely clear why some of the scenes were deleted.

It starts when Julia's character, Sarah's, mother dies, in a car accident. She goes to live with her estranged father, in an almost-all black community. There is this whole inter-racial theme going on, and really puts up with what it is for whites to date blacks. The whole story is amazing, and there are so many sub-plots; teenage pregnancy, drugs, parent problems, (i.e. splitting, and death,) moving, and relationship. Sarah wants to go to Julliard for ballet, but then after she moves she goes to a club where everything is hip-hop, and she's on the outside.

2610564,4,B000GG4Y64,"Want to see a great movie with realistic drama, great characters, and plenty of excitement?  Than make sure not to miss ""Save The Last Dance"".
Starring in ""Save The Last Dance"" is Julie Stiles, who plays Sarah. Sarah has just moved in with her dad into a not-so-nice neighborhood in Chicago. Sarah's mother died on the way to Sarah's Julliard dance recital, leaving Sarah overwhelmed with guilt and wanting nothing to do with dancing any longer. Sarah is immediately thrust into a new school where she is outnumbered by race. However, she manages to fit in, yet at the same time make some enemies. She finds a place for herself in a crowd that frequents the local dance clubs; and it's through this dancing she finds herself a boyfriend, a guy named Derek (played by Sean Patrick Thomas) who is planning to become a doctor. Derek is a sensitive and intelligent young man, but his friends leave a lot to be desired. After a somewhat rough start between Sarah and Derek, they hit it off pretty well.
But things are never far from exploding into disaster. Racial tension mounts between Derek's best friend and Sarah, who openly disapproves of their interracial relationship. Derek meanwhile is trying to get Sarah to open herself back up to dance and at the same time confront her irrational feeling of guilt over her mother's death. With pressure coming in at all sides to Sarah and Derek, their relationship seems doomed. Will Sarah ever be able to achieve her once strong desire to become a dancer? Will she and Derek ever be able to overcome their many obstacles? Will violence overcome both Sarah's relationship and friendship? Watch Save The Last Dance and find out.
A major plus in this movie is some of the dance scenes and music, if you like rap/hip-hop and dance. Sarah's last dance scene actually gave me goose bumps; it was an awesome display of modern dance and hip-hop mixed in with ballet. In the after-movie interview that you get with the video, Julia Stiles confessed that it took weeks to film that one dance scene, and that she trained very hard for the part. It shows. Another plus in this movie was the realistically gritty scenes between the characters. Racial tension is a difficult subject to tackle sometimes. However, Save The Last Dance manages to pull it off pretty well.
I really liked Sarah, the character that Julia Stiles played. She comes across as a tough, won't-take-anything-from-anyone type of girl who also has her share of emotional issues. I loved how she was so straight out and wouldn't take any crap from the people who insulted her. Many will also be able to empathize with her guilt and heartache at losing her mother, and her uncertainty in dealing with her father, who she barely knows. I also liked the part that Sean Patrick Thomas, as Derek, played. He managed quite admirably to pull off the role as bad-boy-turned-good and a serious student headed for Medical School. He also came across very convincingly as a caring boyfriend any girl would love to have. In the movie, one of Derek's best friends, to whom he is actually indebted (the guy covered for Derek in a past crime they both committed, back when Derek was into petty crimes and such), is trying to both bring him down by insulting Derek's girlfriend and by coercing him to join into his violent and illegal activities.
The other characters in ""Save The Last Dance"", although I didn't like them all, played their parts very well and helped the movie come together as a realistic, gritty high-school drama.
There wasn't much about this movie I didn't like. There is however a little bit of violence in the movie (it is rated PG13), and some disturbing racial tension. Sometimes I felt the racial problems were a little overdone, and sometimes the characters in that way were too cruel. I was a little annoyed at all the people who obviously wanted Derek and Sarah apart because of their different races. I mean, if they are happy, who cares about color? Leave them alone already! The movie seems to have a bit more meaning to it then you would think, especially if you've watched it as many times as I have.
Overall, I think many people will like this movie. It is of course available in both DVD and VHS formats, and sometimes is played on the premium movie channels on cable TV. Why not rent it and check it out if you already haven't? If you are turned off by movies with racial tension and some violence, then by all means skip this one. However, if you want a dramatic and realistic movie about growing up in a ghetto-like Chicago neighborhood, with a little romance thrown in, and want to see some awesome dancing, make sure to check out ""Save The Last Dance""!",1086912000,,4674,4.672330097087379

2610567,5,B000GG4Y64,"SAVE THE LAST DANCE
Save the last dance is a different type of dance-romance film that is fitted for all ages. It is an inspiring film that captures the interest of most teenagers. For some reason, it helps them to understand more about the conflicts of life and reminds them that unexpected things really happen in one's life that can change one's simple life into a bit more complicated one.
The film is about Sara Johnson (Julia Stiles), a simple white American teenager that is determined to get into Julliard, a top-notch ballet school. She dreams of becoming a ballet dancer and auditions into Julliard; unfortunately, her mother dies in a fatal car accident because of rushing into Sara's unsuccessful audition. Because of her mother's death, Sara blames herself and quits ballet. She then moves to Chicago where his once-caring father (Terry Kinney) lives. To continue her studies, Sara has to go to an all black high school and there is where she meets Chenille (Kerry Washington), a fun and loving teen-age mother. At first, Sara hated going in that school because of this guy named Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas) whom she debates with at an English class. This guy happens to be Chenille's brother. Later, Sara begins to make friends with Derek because of his sister Chenille. Derek helps introduce Sara to a hip-hop club called steps, where he is a natural dance floor talent. The two became good friends and begin practicing dance together, with Derek showing hip hop moves.
Conflict arises when the two starts to have a close relationship with one another. There is the pressure of everyone criticizing Derek and Sara because of the difference in their skin color. But because of their strong faith and love with each other, they continue their lives together. Sara continues her dream of becoming a ballet dancer and successfully joins the Julliard School of ballet with the help and encouragement of Derek and with the support of her father. Then on, everything goes right and the film ends up happily.",1079395200,,2015,4.894736842105263

This movie is not one of those predictable mushy romance movies. It's real in every sense of the word. Yes it does have romance but of a different kind. This movie deals with teenagers and what they have to deal with in a realsitic setting. A white girl in a black neighbourhood is not an easy situation. Then on top of that her and a INTELLIGENT BLACK MALE fall in love. This girl also has a gift in dancing but in ballet. So not only is she trying to fit in a literally all-black community but she also has to defend her relationship with her friend's brother and adapt to the hip hop dance culture. This movie deals with these issues in such a great realsitic way and I'll recommend anyone to buy it. The fusion of the classical and hip hop culture is amazing and the cast plays their roles so well. Also with the DVD is the usual extras. It has the making of the film and music video (which is very interesting), the music video itself, interviews with cast and crew members, film trailer and deleted secnes.

The plot had potential, but the fact that none of the actors in the movie can really dance pretty much watered it down for me. It's not possible to relate to Julia Stiles as an aspiring ballerina when she can't even dance en pointe(and it SHOWS). They could have at least tried to make the splicing between her and her dancing double more smooth. The hip-hop dance sequences are mediocre at best. Having multiple storylines going on makes it impossible to ever go deeper into any of them.

Sara messes up the audition while her mother dies in a car crash.  Sara is positively devastated and holds herself responsible.
Sara is forced to move in with her clueless musician father, played by Terry Kinney.  She moves into a black neighborhood and attends a black school.

Derek invites her to dance, but she is obviously lost, while Niki, Derek's ex-girlfriend, shows off her flawless moves.
Derek offers to teach Sara how to dance.  When she accepts sparks fly, but not just between Sara and Derek, but between Niki and Derek too.

Ultimately uplifting, the movie follows the story of 17-year-old Sara who is forced to move into a mainly African-American neighbourhood and struggles to fit in with the crowd. Her love of dancing was cast aside after her mother's death and Save the Last Dance is all about how one boy helped her to rediscover her passion and talent with a new edge.
This movie will have you laughing, crying and dancing with the loveable characters and the fun hip hop dance scenes. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is in need of some inspiration or to anyone with a lor of dance or music!",1041292800,,643,4.6

Not every dance movie is good, but this one sure is.
It is interesting to see the roles reversed for once: instead of seeing a teenager from a minority group trying to fit in with the white kids, we see a white kid thrust into a world she probably never dreamed of being in.
The way the kids at the predominantly black school react to the girl seems pretty realistic and understandable.
But then you've got the dancing, and boy is it hot! Mostly we see a bunch of funky kids getting down and dirty at the local club, Steps, (obviously not named after the cheesy English pop group) their attitude showing in their moves. Makes you wanna get out there with them. Then Julia Stiles' character (damn I can't remember her name... Sarah?) enhances her talent for ballet by inheriting some of that raw passion, and attitude, which I believe is what dancing is all about!
Hip hop is the best style of dance, so I just adored seeing so much of it in a film, which was intertwined with a great story.  Sean Patrick Thomas is hot, by the way.
Also has a slammin' (yes, slammin', not cool) soundtrack. Gotta love it!",1034380800,,1279,4.419491525423729
2610588,4,B000GG4Y64,"Save the Last Dance (2001), starring Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas, is more than your average teen movie.  This romantic drama deals with grief, guilt, interracial relationships, violence, and inner conflicts.  While most romantic dramas are extremely predictable, Director Thomas Carter II does a wonderful job with plot twists.
The movie begins with Sara Johnson (Julia Stiles) on a train headed for Chicago to live with her estranged father, Roy (Terry Kinney).  Sara begins to have flash backs on the train, and soon we find out that Sara was an aspiring ballet dancer, and while auditioning for the Julliard School of Dance, her mother was killed in a tragic car accident on her way to the audition.  Grief and guilt cause Sara to hang up her ballerina shoes.
Sara arrives in Chicago and is forced to live a completely different life style than she is accustomed to.  She attends a predominantly African American high school on Chicago's rough South Side.  In her first English class, she gets into a debate with Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas), and immediately dislikes him because of his attitude.  Sara feels out of place until she befriends Chenille (Kerry Washington), a single teenage mother.  It turns out that Derek is Chenille's brother, which is totally unexpected by Sara and the viewing audience.
Sara quickly adjusts to living in an African American culture with the help of her new friends.  Sara begins to take an interest in Derek when he asks her to dance at a popular hip hop club.  As Derek begins to coach her on hip hop dancing, an interracial relationship begins, and so do the social problems.
Dancing is the key to this movie because that is how most of the relationships develop.  Most of the conflicts take place during the dancing scenes as well.
Overall, I rated this film a four star rating.  I was expecting another teen movie, and instead I got so much more out of it.  If you are interested in a serious drama that touches on a plethora of topics this film is worth viewing.",1033257600,,2014,4.769452449567724

2610592,4,B000GG4Y64,"This is a well acted, somewhat sanitized and idealized story of a talented teeage girl who, on the cusp of achieving her dream, loses everything, only to find it again in a way no one would have predicted. It is a story about attaining one's dreams and the process by which they may become a reality. This is a well acted, though predictable, coming of age tale that can be enjoyed by young and old alike.
Here, the talented Julia Stiles plays the role of Sara, a teenager who happens to be a talented ballet dancer. Auditioning for the famous Julliard School, while angry at her single parent mother for being late to her audition, she fumbles her audition. She finishes, only to discover that her mother, in her haste to make Sara's audition, died in a tragic car accident on her way. Blaming herself for her mother's death, Sara gives up ballet.
Her pleasant life suddenly snatched from her, Sara is forced to go live with her estranged dad, Roy, wonderfully acted by Terry Tinney. A down and out jazz musician who lives on Chicago's tough south side, Roy does the best he can to make up for lost time. Sara, seemingly undaunted by her seamy new surroundings, enters a predominantly black high school, where she is befriended by fellow student, Chanelle, a single mom with a hunky, intelligent brother, Derek, played by Sean Patrick Thomas, who is well cast in the role. Bound for Georgetown University, Derek hopes to one day become a doctor.
Through her blossoming relationship with Derek, Sara begins to dance again. It is through his encouragement and nurturing that she regains the confidence to follow her dream and audition once again for Julliard. It is also through his commitment to Sara that Derek finds the courage to tell his gangsta wanna be friend that he wants no further involvement in his friend's nefarious activities, before it is too late for him.
Sara's audition is a show stopping dance routine that is the icing on this enjoyable, coming of age film. It is a testament to hope and to the power of love.",1027728000,,2029,4.670391061452514

We go from scenes with her in ballet slippers and bad feet, to scenes with her supposedly in pointe shoes and GREAT feet... wow! How did that happen...
The choreography for Miss Stiles could have been better, but what can a choreographer do when she has to use some one with no formal dance training... the director should have thought twice about casting her.
As for the other aspects of the film... they are the only redeeming qualities... The story line is exceptional and the footage at the club is great... hard to believe it was a set and not an actual club. Kerry Washington did a wonderful job... extremely talented.

Sarah was a girl from the mid-west who was a serious student of ballet. Her mother dies in a car accident on the way to see her perform. Sarah feels guilty, drops dancing and has to go live in the inner city of Chicago with her estranged father. She is now the only white kid in an all black high school. She starts a relationship with a black male student (Sean Patrick Thomas) who is a better dancer than she is but hip hop. Sarah has tons more self-confidence and social skills than any high school girl I can possibly imagine. and her boy friend has got more handle on life than a dozen old wise men. its not realistic and who cares! Both are every likeable and lovable. Sarah (Jula Stiles) is a nice sight to behold with a personality to match. Apparently she has been acting as a child was 21 when the movie was made. I wonder how many viewers will notice the paradox/irony when they see the tenement that Sarah lives in with her father compared to the very nice middle class apartment that Sarah's black girl friend (Chenille Williams) lives in. It is Sarah's black friend who (with hostility) insists black and white are two separate worlds. I couldn't help thinking that the chains that bind her in slavery and second class citizenship exist only in her own mind. I think this is what the different condition of their apartments was partially underscoring. But on the other hand! It looks like the black students have a tough row to hoe to get of the dysfunctional environment they live in; whereas, I feel I am speaking for most viewers whn I say we assume Sarah's journey onward and upward through life will be one enchanted",1026604800,,1838,4.572727272727272

Unfortunately, the actual dance performances in ""Save the Last Dance"" (at least the ones by the main character, and especially her climactic dance sequence) were surprisingly flat. I couldn't help but compare the dancing to the much-better White Nights (ASIN 6302862949, sadly not on DVD), Flashdance (ASIN B00005JKG5) or the equally-flawed performances in Fosse (ASIN B00005UQ8F). Of course, in Flashdance, they cheated by having a professional dancer replace Jennifer Beals in the dance sequences, but still, Julia Stiles just doesn't sell the moves, and I kind of wish they had pulled a Flashdance-style substitution for some of the dance sequences.
As to the rest of the movie, this was definitely a better-than-average teen flick, though the interracial relationship politcal stuff was a bit heavy handed. (I may be oversensitive on that issue, though, since I'm in an interracial marriage myself.)",1024876800,,1135,5.276243093922652
2610596,3,B000GG4Y64,"Julia Stiles plays Sara Johnson, a teenager who has her life turned upside down when her mother dies suddenly. With this single accident comes any number of world-shattering changes: Suddenly her passion for dance becomes a source of guilt. She is forced to live with her father, a stranger who has played no role in her life since leaving her and her mother. To do this, she must move from her middle class white world to urban Chicago, where her blond hair and ballet training do little to help her blend in with her new peers.
But Sara is no wallflower, and finds a place for herself in her new school and community. Here, too, dance plays an important part of life, and in learning how to ""speak"" the physical language of hip hop dance, Sara is befriended by Derek Reynolds (Sean Patrick Thomas). Despite the pressures from their peers, Sara and Derek find themselves drawn to each other, and help each other grow.
While I feel that this movie glosses over many of the problems Sara would have faced in her situation, it's a passable teen romance, and tries to have a message. How successful this message will be at reaching its target audience is dubious, but the movie will probably be enjoyed for its music and dance sequences, and for its humor.",1022371200,,1253,4.598214285714286

Sara is an 17 year old ballet dancer, destined for Julliard but when her mother is killed in a car crash on the way to her audition she is sent to live with her father in the inner-city. At her new school she finds that most of the students are black snd she is the one who stands out. She makes friends with Chanille a teen-age single mother. Her first night out at a hip hop club she feels awkward and stiff despite her ballet training. Chanille's brother Derek starts to teach her to dance hip hop style and they start to fall for each other. She shares with him that she feels her mothers death was her fault and her secret dream to still go to Julliard. He tells her to go for her dreams and helps her get back into shape. But thay are slowly learning that people don't view their relationship as an appropriate one. She's white. He's black. And they don't belong to one another. Derec's ex-grilfriend makes that clear and at one point Chanille tells Sara ""after drugs,gangs and drive-by's your taking up one of the only decent guys left"" after hearing that she goes to Derek and tells him maybe they should take a break from their relationship so they can think it over.

2610599,3,B000GG4Y64,"`Save The Last Dance' is a movie about Sara, who hopes to win a place at Julliard to do ballet.  However, when her mother dies in a car crash she goes to live with her father and becomes one of the only white people at her new school, forgetting about ballet altogether.  Feeling an outsider at first she befriends the popular Chenille and becomes interested in her brother Derek.  Before long Sara and Derek are seeing each other and her old love of ballet is reawakened, influenced by the hip-hop and rap that her friends listen to.
Although the romance and the reawakening of Sara's dream is obvious enough, it is its refusal to skirt the tricky issues not often dealt in teen movies.  Chenille's baby, the estranged father and arguments concerning race are all in there alongside the beautiful faces, dancing, fighting and kissing.  It's true that it's a distinctly average movie on several levels but it should be credited by giving a realistic interpretation of teenage life amidst racial tension.  For example, the inevitable fight between Sara and Derek takes place not so much because of Derek's ex (Bianca Lawson - Kendra from `Buffy The Vampire Slayer'), but because of the friction that Sara causes with Derek's friends and family.  It may all lead to a sappy conclusion but it's a rare teen move that will show a shoot-out and a mother still at school.",1013990400,,1365,4.734177215189874

I also felt the way she did when moving to the city, though my area is DEFINATLY not as rough as Sara [Julia Stiles]'s was.  I thought the acting was done well (Julia was originally a trained Shakesperean Actress) and the Cheoreography was *excellent*  Here is a little fact you might not know: Did you know she isn't actually doing the ballet in the film?  If you notice, the camera never shows her FULL body when she is standing up to tippy toe, just shots of her feet and then her upper body, which was very well done 'cause I didn't even notice (and maybe you won't either!).  Needless to say her Acting was very well done and newcomer Sean Patrick Thomas wasn't too shabby as well.  The club scene just makes one wanna get up and dance.  So, if you're a teenager who's into popular r&b/hip-hop or a fan of julia stiles, this one's for you. Adults sometimes take movies a little too seriously, such as this one for instance.

Also dealt with is teen violence, teen pregnancy and motherhood, racism, death, the breakdown of the nuclear family and following your dreams and staying committed.  Related to the theme of commitment portrayed in the film, is the commitment made by both Sean Patrick Thomas and Julia Stiles to educate themselves about this subculture and dance.  Countless hours, weeks and months were put in by both Sean and Julia in dance studios, with choreographers and in nightclubs.  Contrary to Mr. Shannon's previous statement, Julia Stiles had no professional dance body double.  She did all her own dancing.

While the plot points are all standard (girl learning to live with a father who's practically a stranger as she grieves for her mother; white girl-black boy; girl dances her way into a happier life; promising young black man has to choose between gangs and a bright future), the characters have somewhat more depth than you might expect, and the acting is consistently good.  Julia Stiles's Sara is genuinely sullen and resentful at the same time as you understand why Derek would be attracted to her.  Derek is, of course, a little too good to be true (how many teenage boys are this sensitive?), but then, he's not as cute as she is, so I guess it balances out.

2610621,5,B000GG4Y64,"My best friend took me to see ""Save the Last Dance"" in the theaters as a late birthday gift. I wanted to see the movie so bad, I wasn't sleeping at night. And it was worth how long it was. It kept me throughout the entire movie. I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. I was kind of mesmerized by the dancing. The director mixed Sara's extraordinary talent for ballet and Sean Patrick Thomas's (sorry I don't remember his name) talent for contemporary, fast dancing that you just go with the flow with and came up with a fantastic dance of ballet and contemporary. Perfect for Juillard. Both Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas did a great job in the movie. This isn't a chick-flick dance movie, either. Dance plays a big part, but the movie also focuses on Sara in general, her transistion to Chicago, to a new school, life without her mom, etc. This has to do with Sara meeting someone who helps her move on after her mom. Someone who helps her catch up with her dancing.  Someone who encourages her to try again for Juillard. Someone like Sean Patrick Thomas. Julia Stiles did great as Sara. Sean Patrick Thomas did great as her friend. They both got into the roles, so that you couldn't tell it was a movie. It mesmerizes you, and gets you drawn into the action so much you think you're there. This is a great movie that is well worth watching and buying.

2610622,4,B000GG4Y64,"This movie is about change and how a young woman adjusts to a new life in the inner city with her father after the mother dies in an auto crash. Sara had hopes of studying dance at Juillard, but her dream dies with the death of her mother. She accepts her new life with quiet stoicism and resignation, but is awaken by Hip Hop dancing and her new friends. With the help of her boyfriend who is determined to become a pediatrician, Sara winds up following her dream of studying dance at Juillard. Although the plot is predictable, the characters are fully dimensional and realistic, which makes for an interesting movie for teenagers and adults alike. Stiles' Hip Hop dancing was not quite convincing, although she makes a good effort. At times her body language conveyed a self-consciousness, making me feel like she wasn't quite comfortable with this dance form. Alas, that must mean her solo dance sequences were done by a dance double. It's a feel-good story but with enough real-life situations thrown in to prevent it from becoming saccharine, such as the drive-by shootings, a single mom's struggles with an errant father, the explicit language that nobody hasn't already heard a zillion times before. If this movie was a true depiction of inner city high school life, language and situations would be a lot rawer and more violent. But true-life realism wasn't the goal of this film. It's a likable movie that you will enjoy watching over and over again with a great soundtrack and fun dance sequences.",998697600,,1508,4.803846153846154
2610623,5,B000GG4Y64,"From 10 Things I hate about you to Save the Last Dance, Julia Stiles never seems to disappoint. Her co-star Sean Patrick Thomas can also be credited for his role in Cruel Intentions. Stiles brings her a sense of reality to the movie and you can really begin to relate to her character and the things happening around her.
Sara (Julia Stiles) is left in the not so pretty side of Chicago with her father Roy. Her mother had just died trying to get to her big audition for Julliard. The movie opens on a train, and Sara remembering the time before the train ride. She lives in an apartment with her jazz playing father, and the two don't really get along. In school she meets up with a girl named Chenille and they become instant friends. Chenielle asks Sara to join them in going to a local club named Steppes.
Stiles isn't used to the Hip Hop ways of dance, but Chenielle's brother Derek (Thomas) is quick to ask her to dance. Sara has to get used to the music, but before she can she makes a fool of herself. Derek asks her if she wants to get together some time and work on her moves. They get together and soon Thomas and Stiles are heating up the dance floor.  All through the movie you see the tuffness the couples endure and the ""predjiduce"" that seemed to go along with it. Derek helps Sara realize her dreams and then in the end helps her complete her dreams.
This is a must see movie for ages 13 and up, and an absolute great date movie. So see it and enjoy!",998524800,,1467,4.239285714285714

Now she is without a mom and is forced to live with her estranged father in the Bronx.  Wanting to fit in, she begins to learn the arts of hip-hop and learning to move with the music.  She then falls in love with a deascent black young man who'd been teaching her the moves.  With problems getting in the way of her relationship, she still pursues her career in ballet.
MY REVIEW:
""This film was pretty good, but nothing really excellent.  I got what I expected.  It is a great teen film with romance, humor and everyday teenage descisions.  The story everyone has to admit, was somewhat typical.  We've seen that kind of plot several times.  But the acting and realism pulled it all together in one good film.  --It's the perfect date movie--! So check out SAVE THE LAST DANCE.""- MJV & the Movies.",997315200,,976,4.402234636871508

It's more than just a movie about dance.  We meet Sara (Julia Stiles) whose dream is to go to Julliard and be a prima ballerina.  Because of a life changing event, Sara decides to no longer pursue her dream.
After transferring to a new school and making new friends, Sara decides to share some of her life events with one of these friends, Derrick.  This opening up comes about because Derrick has agreed to teach Sara to dance (hip-hop).  After she displays a ballet move with attitude, he challenges her.
The challenge is to open up, let go of the hurt, and pursue her dreams.  Sara decides to give Julliard another chance.
Sara is faced with the challenge of pursuing her dream, and justifying her romantic relationship with Derrick.  During this time, Derrick is challenged with staying true to himself and true to his boy.",996537600,,1032,4.694444444444445

2610638,4,B000GG4Y64,"This is the Hip-Hop version of Fame and Flashdance, no doubt about it. The one thing missing is a bucket of water. In this movie, Sara begins the movie giving up her dream of going to the Julliard school of ballet after her mother died in a car accident while Sara was auditioning. Due to the mother's death, Sara had to move in with her father on Chicago's south side. Most of the plot is fairly predictable from there, but the predictability does not detract too much from the movie's timeliness or relevance. In the movie, several issues are raised including single mom teenage parenthood, interracial dating, and a little bit of gang warfare. While the issues brought up are certainly relevant, some of the situations throughout the movie are somewhat idealistic, like an after-school special on TV. In addition, the story ends with at least a few loose strings.
The DVD is great, as it includes some deleted scenes that help tie the story up a bit more neatly. In addition, the music both within the movie and the DVD should please even those who are not too crazy about Hip-Hop music.",995414400,,1090,4.652849740932642

And while I have always felt she is a talented actress, her roles usually leave us with an impression of a flat, two-dimensional character.
And then there was Save the Last Dance.  Just as Julia's character, Sara, is thrown into a totally new setting, Stiles is thrown into a different role.  For the first time, Julia portrays a character affected by deep, complex emotions.
While this movie follows the ever-popular formula for romances aimed at the high school aged female, it manages to have a much wider appeal.  Even my fiance enjoyed the movie, watching it not just once but twice.  Not bad for a guy who doesn't like a movie unless there are gunfights and explosions!

Thomas Carter's (Haywood from the White Shadow) direction was flawless.  The films pacing was smooth while it certainly boiled with intensity in the spots where it was needed.  The only other thing I personally would have liked would for there to have been some integration with some of Ms. Stile's father's jazz tunes.  To integrate that with the ballet and hip hop would have sent an even more powerful message than just the ballet hip hop combo.
Ms Stiles is a talented actress but I can't say as much for her dancing talents.  Though she is certainly to be commended to even be credible as both a ballet dancer and flo..in' wit some hip hop.  But her ballet was somewhat stilted and her hip hop although technically correct she lacked the flavor that really is hip hop.  (She had the steps down but didnt' have the flow)  Great dancers don't look like they're trying to dance.  Ms. Stiles always looked like she was reading some diagrams out of a book while she was dancing.

2610674,3,B000GG4Y64,"Both Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas put in a five-star performance in a film, which is clearly a cut and paste job from popular films of the past.  The story begins by wandering badly, shooting convoluted subplots that lead the viewer nowhere.  Several times I turned this movie off and walked away from it.  Usually I won't waste my time on a flick that doesn't get moving; but, having seen Julia Stiles in past films, I kept returning for another go.  Finally, one hour into the film, a thread takes shape and Stiles gets to show her exceptional talent for drama; it's a talent she owns, no doubt about that.  Thomas also does a great job in support of Stiles, and a handful of scenes ring true and clear.  To me, those scenes were the whole movie.  I'll watch it again, but only after I fast-forward to the one-hour mark.
What intrigues me is the opportunity this film missed: it should have explored further, the romantic relationship between Derek (Thomas) a black high school student and Sara (Stiles) one of the few white female students in Derek's school.  In their roles, they depict two very intelligent students who have fallen in love, but the treatment of their relationship is shallow and lacks depth.
The resources were there to do something great.  Was it the screen writer the director, or both --- who yank the viewer around for an hour and then get a thread going, only to weave it through boring cliches.  Fortunately, both Stiles and Thomas have great futures in store for them and I hope that soon, they'll be offered roles that challenge their strengths to the limit.

The story tells of a young teenage girl who just lost her mother and has to move in with her father who she hasn't seen for almost her whole life. Upon her mother death she gives up dancing beacause she says""thats the one thing her mother really wanted.""  Her dad lives in a all black neighborhood. She has to learn almost a new way of life. Theres a new way of dress,new way of speach,and the fact that crime is accepted. On the first day of school she makes new friends and falls in love. This is a great movie if you believe in mixed couples (like i do)I think that this movie really sends a message about that to all its viewers. I think that Sean Thomas gives a wonderful performance but Julia Stiles is not to good her acting is pretty poor in this movie! Also if you are a adult and have teen children this is a great movie for teens! I am a teen myself and it was the most talked about movie at our school. Also I know for a fact that this movie stayed in theaters for about 2 or 3 months now that has to mean something. Also know of alot of adults who liked it too!

2610683,5,B000GG4Y64,"Save The Last Dance is quite a bit smarter, and more entertaining, than the majority of what some people call teenybopper flicks.  Much of this is due to the performances of Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas.  I know Thomas only from a small role in Cruel Intentions (one of my guilty pleasures from 1999), but Stiles always seems to bring an added depth to her movies, from 10 Things I Hate About You to Hamlet.  This movie's no different.  She's the protagonist, the heart and soul of the movie, and she doesn't disappoint.
  Stiles is Sarah Johnson, a suburban teen whose life is torn apart when her mother is killed in a car accident en route to her daughter's ballet recital.  Sent to live with her estranged father Roy (Terry Kinney), a down-on-his-luck jazz musician, she is forced to adapt to her new environment -- inner city Chicago.  There she enrolls in a school in which she is pretty much the only color.  She makes friends with Chenille Reynolds (Kerry Washington), a single mother, and her brother Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas), a smart kid who is at a crossroads in life.  She also makes enemies with Nikki (Bianca Lawson), who wants Derek all to herself, and Malakai (Fredro Starr), Derek's best friend and convicted criminal, who's swiftly descending into a life of crime.  Needless to say, a relationship develops between Sarah and Derek, and they help each other: he gets her involved in dance again, and she opens his mind to the possibilities of life outside the hood.
  Save The Last Dance is more realistic than many of its counterparts.  The high school looks like a real high school.  The dance club is more like a dance club; ie, some people dance, some don't, and nobody breaks out into a quasi-Busby Berkeley style group dance number.  And the actors make their characters seem like real people.  Director Thomas Carter and screenwriters Duane Adler and Cheryl Edwards bring up a number of issues that make the movie more than just another teen flick.  If you're a romantic, the ending will leave you with a huge smile on your face, and perhaps even choke you up.  It's definitely worth taking a look at.",991958400,,2135,4.690860215053763

The story of a young woman that gets pushed into a new world without any fault of her own is not new, but the music, the actors, the plot make it worth every minute. While most movies for young adults seldom address real problems, this movie paints a sad, but realistic picture of what racial problems mean for many. At the same time it doesn't go overboard.  The movie still has it's fun points, the music and the great dancing are incredible. Seeing the metamorphosis of Sarah in Chicago at a basically all-black school is very funny at times but also has its thoughtful moments. The actors, Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas are fantastic, being believable every step of the way. Their feat of hip hop dancing should not go unnoticed.

2610706,5,B000GG4Y64,"Inspiring. Since I am a young film maker and actor I can say this with a real meaning. From the start, emotion, inspiration, happiness and more. This film would not have been anywhere near as good if it weren't for a very talented nineteen year old, new US actress Julia Stiles. To say it all in a few senteces: Sarah (Julia) has her mother killed in a car accident whilst on her way to see Sarah in a ballet audition. Sarah moves to Chicago with her distant father and begins her first day in a near all black surburban school. She meets (Seann Patrick Scott) a popular black guy who tutors Sarah on hip hop dance. At the same time she feels ballet would be the way, which (Scott) helps happen and tops it off with a kiss. Of course the others around the inter racial couple do not really approve, some nasty confrontations do arise. I you have not seen, see and if you have seen, see again. Good work Mr Carter.",987465600,,913,4.283236994219653
2610707,5,B000GG4Y64,"I had wanted to see this film forever, the soundtrack was out of this world and everyone said it was amazing. Or everyone I listened to at least. So I finally saw it and had cause to believe them. I didn't want to leave the theatre after it was over, only to sit there and watch them dance and smile and let it all wash over me. We sat there long after everyone had left thinking that if only Sean Patrick Thomas would smile at us our lives would be sorted.
Of course it wasn't just the smile it was everything about the movie. Julia Stiles plays a poigniant ballerina caught up in the midst of loss and confusion while Thomas, the aspiring pediatrician, becomes her saviour. We adored them, wanted them to be real because we had never seen anyone dance like they did. She had grace and beauty and he had style and energy, together they became something we could happily watch and get lost in.
As they save each other form the worlds that they exist in and the emotions that surround them the movie expands into its social context, is more than just the dancing and the physical energy that seems to crackle between Stiles and Thomas. The soundtrack contributes to everything that the movie becomes and is erratic and interchangeable, it portrays a side of both our doctor and our ballerina. I couldn't not smile when they smiled, or feel I should be dancing when they danced. They made me move and you have to give them credit for sharing their energy with us.",987206400,,1461,4.434944237918216
2610708,4,B000GG4Y64,"Well I though this movie was pretty funny as a comedy, and hey it had a decent message.  The lives of the primary characters were going downhill when they were ""getting wasted"" every night, and once they took control of their lives things turned around.  Hey it was funny too.  Yah it didn't win any academy awards, but that is just actors giving other actors awards anyway, so I tend to ignore that.",987120000,,400,4.4520547945205475
2610709,5,B000GG4Y64,"Ballet is tricky. It is, after all, 'high art', not instantly accessible or naturally multiplex-enticing. So it is wonderful that the makers of Save the Last Dance had the guts and intelligence to take the ballet - one of the key narrative and character hooks of the film - seriously. (Unlike the makers of last year's Billy Elliot, supposedly the story of a ballet-dancing hopeful, who were clearly so ashamed of ballet that they gave it virtually no screen time, replacing it with lamely choregraphed tap and, worse, bouncing up and down to hits of the 70s.)
Indeed, the makers of Save the Last Dance take everything seriously. For an MTV teen/romantic drama/whatever this film has a gravity I didn't expect. The two hour run-time gives them time to explore the personal worlds the leading characters inhabit, while never using a scene where a line or a look would do. On that count, it's potentially the least patronising, and least slick, story-telling I've seen for months. What no long scenes with characters explaining the plot to each other? And no huge tear-jerking 10 minute death scene for the mother?
And with the time they've saved, we get to see dancing. Perhaps somewhat over-edited dancing (we forgive you, MTV) but since when has a recent musical had such quiet but perfect dance numbers as the scenes where Derek teaches Sara? Equally, Sara's final audition piece looks convincing as a ballet/hip-hop meld, rather than the expected hip-hop sugar to help the 'boring stuff' go down.
But getting the ballet right made me nervous that the makers would fall down elsewhere. The acting? Well, the central two roles are impeccably and untrickily acted by Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas, with uniformly strong support from the rest of the cast. The writing? The dialogue is pleasingly untalky, short on cliche and long on making every word count, while the plotting is happily old-fashioned in its tendency to give time and attention to airing debate and tying up loose ends. And for once in a long long while, a soundtrack used for texture rather than telling us precisely what we should be feeling for every millisecond of the film.
And the final message? Well, in any other movie it would be Derek who 'dances his way out of the ghetto' via ballet (hello Billy Elliott), and Julia Stiles would be off to be the surgeon. So the mere fact that the dancer and the surgeon are the other way round is refreshing. Plus, surprise!, a Hollywood film with a central, natural, black/white couple who sleep together without political fanfare, but do make certain people uncomfortable. It's a film that basically ducks very little, while labouring nothing. And that's what you get for having the courage to take high art seriously on screen. A marvellous, moving, clever and understated film.",986515200,,2800,4.896842105263158

I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Granted, the plot appears rather optimistic, but we must consider that making a movie is a restrictive process and not every single helpful detail can be crammed into 2 hours of screen time. All in all  the movie tackled the very American issue of race relations and paints it in a new relief which is both beautiful and refreshing. Seeing the two actors on screen together was a strangely beautiful experience which we often don't get the opportunity to because we are too uncomfortable with it. I think this movie is an inspiration to all dream chasers and all people who face challenges.

2610716,3,B000GG4Y64,"An excellent movie for all open minded people. And not for teenagers only. It hits reality, weighing the fact that movie audience, juveniles, to be exact, approves the message presented in the movie: stereotype it is-stereotype confirmed. Racial and interracial issues well defined. Sarah's transition into her Chicago ""ghetto"" environment is presented in a rather ""coorney"" way. Hard to believe that she would want to become someone else; rather as a survivor kit: to fit into the sweets deprived world. The moral of the story: I'm both: my own friend and enemy. Message spelled out: stop blaming the world for living in the most opportunistic country in the world. Make a decision that you can do it- just like Derek did. And yes, he grew up in dysfunctional home. But he was hungry. And he did realize that ""if it is to be-it's up to me"" and not even my mother...wherever she is. It does not take skin color or money to succeed but hunger and vision. Message to all: fixing the racial/interracial world starts with each individual.

The acting was well done in this movie and the actors made the characters come to life and the characters were very real. This movie deals with everything from drugs, gangs, teen pregnancy, interracial dating, it deals with a lot of real life issues that I am sure many people can relate to.
