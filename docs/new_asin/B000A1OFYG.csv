2350187,1,B000A1OFYG,"I'm a huge fan of David Bowie, Harvey H. and Wesern movies. SO this movie had winner written all over it from where I stood.

What a painful movie to watch. Both Bowie and Harvey looked as though they wanted to be somewhere else. With the notable exception of one tearful scene between Harvy and his Daughter in-law this movie was void of anything that could be remotely called acting.

Not surprising considering there very little story for the actors to leverage off of.

I wanted to like this movie.

Now I know why it was filmed in 1998 and not released in the U.S. for six years.

Save your money and watch it on cable. While it is interesting to watch Bowie try to pull off a southern accent (and he DOES sing Battle Hymn of the Republic) there's very little else going for it.",1129939200,7,783,4.335616438356165
2350188,4,B000A1OFYG,"Shot in the Tuscan mountains of Spain, director Giovanni Veronesi has created a decidedly strange and rather quirky western which continually vacillates between wholesome family entertainment and dark, surreal Tarantinoesque depravity.

Famous gunfighter Johnny Lowen (Harvey Keitel) decides to hang-up his sixshooter and return to the home and family he left some twenty years ago. In his absence his wife has died and his son (Leonardo Pieracconi) has grown-up and is now the town Doctor. Doc is married to a beautiful Indian maiden, Pearl (Sandrine Holt) and has a young half-breed son, Jeremiah (Yudii Mercredi).

Retirement doesn't come easy for Johnny. Jack Sikora (David Bowie), another notorious and reportedly psycho outlaw is on his trail. Jack is determined to kill Johnny, thereby securing for himself the reputation of ""fastest gun."" Johnny's refusal to strap on his sixshooter angers Jack and his gang. They try to change his mind by taking their hostilities out on the townspeople. As the violence escalates it becomes clear that someone will have to face Sikora sooner or later. Who will it be?

A delightfully ecclectic and oddball supporting cast. There's Joshua (Jim van der Woude) the town fool who lives on Doc's roof, crowing like a rooster at sunrise and hooting like an owl through the night. Then there's the very sexy Mary (Alessia Marcuzzi), saloon owner and resident whore who delights the young Jeremiah with her outdoor showers.

However it's Jack Sikora and his seedy entourage that steal the show. There's Rastafarian (Kwame Kwei-Armah) and Albino (Stephan Jenn) two of the most unsavory individuals you'll ever lay your eyes on as Sikora's bodyguards, while Leathergirl (Michelle Gomez) photographs the nefarious deeds of their leader for posterity. Then of course there's David Bowie with his chronologically inappropriate sunglasses and peacock attire posing with delight after every killing.

Definitely not your standard run-of-the-mill western. Worth seeing and should stand up very well with repeat viewings.",1129075200,15,2047,5.4043887147335425

2350190,2,B000A1OFYG,"This movie did not work for me at all. Like others have said, the scenery is excellent,  but thats about it. Unlike most spaghetti westerns most of the actors speak english so they don't need to be dubbed, the rest,  weelll ...? The dialog is pretty bad, very spaghetti western-ish. But really, Harvey Keitel was very good as a gunslinger! But then again he's always great in tough guy roles.  David Bowie was good too, except his attempted western style accent, it needed a little work, but his bad guy was very effective, and Doc's friend Joshua is entertaining. This movie acctually could have been a pretty good western in the right writing and directorial hands. As a westerns fan I won't be watching this one again.

2350192,2,B000A1OFYG,"I think Keitel is a fabulous actor who can be proud of appearances in some of the  greatest roles in all of moviedom.  I also think Bowie (while an outright musical genius) is usually at least an interesting -if not good - actor.

Although the beautiful cinematography of expansive panoramic scenery teases the viewer into thinking the film will be worth watching, sadly, it's really not worth the time it takes to watch the opening credits. I blame the director because there are so many cringe-inducing scenes; I also don't want to believe the aforementioned talents could waste their time on this tripe.",1375228800,,606,4.864077669902913
2350193,1,B000A1OFYG,"This film is so bad that it could possibly cause permanent brain damage. The worst script ever written in film history is right here. The first film to contain some fairly good acting mixed with some acting that is so bad it makes actors in an Ed Wood movie seem like oscar contenders. The plot is rediculous, the editing is terrible, but the music is epic and beautiful- and is totally out of place. Some characters are absolutely bizzare, like this goat bearded guy that stands on roof tops and cackles like a rooster every morning and looks like Tom Waites. Bowie's character talking with an american hick accent seems very stupid and totally out of place for him, as does the role. Many moments are plain wierd and make no sense at all, like when ""roosterman"" is being instructed by Harvey Keitel's character that ""a strong man is a man who has balance"". As Keitel places a dead fish on roosterman's head, roosterman tries to balance it, and falls over. Yes from a sitting position!? The guy who plays keitel's son is not only dreadfully bad and looks like Robert Rodriquez, but his dialogue seems to have been scripted so poorly that it feels like it is out of a scene from 'Battlefield earth'. This film would make a great 'Mystery science theater' experiment. Also it should be including in the archives of every film school, and used as an example of how not to make a bad film. I am a massive Bowie fan, and I heard the warnings before hand. I should have listened.",1367971200,,1474,4.52434456928839
2350194,1,B000A1OFYG,"Words can't begin to express how bad this is, although a few here have done a pretty good job of it.  Suffice it to say:  the first time (think about that) Harvey Keitel's supposedly badass gunslinger character got tears, I thought he must have just realized he was in the worst movie ever being made. A great character actor, completely wasted in this mess.  David Bowie, a decent actor given the right script, can't be saved even by his natural charisma, and the next director who tries to make him speak in a Texas drawl should be smacked.  Gunslinger Bowie speaking like the Englishman he is wouldn't be any more of a stretch than Keitel's son's Italian accent.  ??  This makes SNL's worst skits look Shakespearean.  I have to say I laughed often, but only in disbelief, and it was often painful.  Poor Harvey.  Poor David.",1363046400,,827,4.609589041095891

2350197,1,B000A1OFYG,"We actually like westerns, and Harvey Keitel (despite his apparent contract requirement that he have a scene involving his nude bum written into every film in which he appears), and David Bowie (who seems to choose films primarily based on costuming). Beyond that, we also even like cheesy, B-grade movies, which are often at least good for a laugh. We sat down to watch this one with the expectation that it would either be good, and we'd like it, or it'd be bad, and we'd laugh at it. We were wrong. It was so bad we couldn't even finish it. We wanted to. We tried. It's so poorly written, badly dubbed, appallingly acted, haltingly paced, and generally dismal, that we couldn't plow through. I'm almost tempted to show it to friends as an example of one of the worst films I've ever seen, but it's really just not entertaining enough even as kitsch.",1342137600,,852,4.57516339869281
2350198,5,B000A1OFYG,Mainly got this since it starred David Bowie and i have seen some of his other films like the man who fell to earth. He was a bombshell of course. quite the multi talent.,1293840000,,170,4.029411764705882
2350199,2,B000A1OFYG,"Okay, so I wasn't exactly expecting ""Gunslinger's Revenge"" to be the next ""Unforgiven"". But when the artwork of the 3 tough guys in western garb on the front cover grabbed my attention while sorting the the bargain bin at Wal-Mart caught my eye, I was compelled to picked it up, Hmmm, I thought, as I read the blurb on the back, sounds promising.

An aging infamous gunfighter returns home to live in peace with his family and is forced out of retirement by an even deadlier gunfighter who has been on his trail for a year and is itchin for a shoot out to prove who is best. Sounds like something right up my alley and what's more, one of my favorites, Harvey Keitel, was the star. I couldn't pass it up.

Well, as it turns out, this was of course no ""Unforgiven"", and as a Western lover who never met a Western I didn't like in some way(if nothing else, the scenery and sound of the horses galloping always get to me), I think I can honestly say, this one was terrible. It may possibly be the worst Western I have ever seen.

A young ""half-breed""(as he calls himself) boy is the light of his Indian Mom and White Dad's life. We see the story unfold from his eyes. The little town they live in has it's share of quirky characters, and live not far from the reservation with the boys maternal family. Dad is the town ""Doc"" and seems to be the peacemaker of all quarrels. When two guys argue in the middle of town and threaten to take each other out, Doc steps in the middle(literally) and all is forgiven. But when Doc's father returns to town after a twenty year absence, he turns their lives upside down.

Johnny Lowen(Keitel) was an infamous gunfighter. None tougher or faster on the draw. But he is through with the life of a killer and wants to come home to the homestead where he was born and live a peaceful life with his son and family. But, with him he brings trouble. When Jack Sikora, an even deadlier gunfighter - due to the fact that he is not only good with a gun, but a ""psycho"" as well - comes looking for Lowen for one last gunfight, Lowen's family and the entire town are put in danger. Live's are being lost as Sikora taunts Lowen out of retirement and eventually Sikora has found a way to get Lowen to strap his gun belt back on.

This movie was filmed as if someone was trying to resurrect the old spaghetti western genre, and just failed miserably. It should be left in peace and in all the glory it had in the 60's and 70's. The good guys, (including our anti-hero wanna-be Keitel)with the possible execption of Doc's slightly touched sidekick and his wife, were the biggest bunch of wimps ever to set foot in the old west. The only time Keitel ever even used his gun was to shoot bottles off a fence post. The only one who shows an ounce of spirit and courage was the boy's mom. Doc, who was born in the west, spoke like he just graduated from some eastern finishing school. The acting was pitiful, dialogue awful, the action slow, painful and boring. I also expected more of a storyline for the Indians who were merely kept informed of the events and predicted what the ""spirits"" would do.

I would have expected one of my all time favorite tough guys, Harvey Keitel, to save this horrible film, as I have never seen a movie that had him in it that I didn't enjoy. But really the only meaty role and really good acting came from David Bowie, who was truly a scary psycho surrounded by an entourage of more psycho killers. So a star for him, and one for the music. I forgive Mr. Keitel for this, everyone has to have one bad film(think Brando in 'The Island of Dr. Moreau""), but as a fan, and as a Western lover, I'm sorry to say, I can not recommend this film at all(I'm not even sure this fits into the ""western"" genre""). There wasn't even that scenery or galloping horse sound to help me warm to this film. I watched the clock more then the film and was glad when the hour an a half came to an end.

The film is rated PG13 and has some violence(and one nude scene) mixed in with this other wise tame film.

Saddle Up and ride in the opposite direction of this one.

Badly directed, miscast, and lead actor (Italian) had an unfortunate voiceover attempt. I felt sorry for the Native American actors who had to stand around and actually do lines for this lame movie.

2350203,4,B000A1OFYG,"Gunslinger's Revenge is an Italian made Western featuring Harvey Keitel and David Bowie.  Now, if that's not enough to make you go, ""Hmmmmm...now THAT sounds interesting,"" nothing will.

While the idea of Keitel and Bowie in a modern day Spaghetti Western sounds like a real hoot of a movie - lots of action and great dialogue - what the filmmakers delivered was a charming, touching movie instead.  Sure, there are bits here and there that are inappropriate for kids under 14 or 15, but on the whole this really is a family movie at heart.  And that's unusual for a Spaghetti Western.  But, then again, Spaghetti Westerns pretty much died out 30 years ago, so this is really a new generation's take on the Spaghetti Western.  (Clearly, this isn't a Leone Spaghetti Western.  It isn't even a Corbucci Spaghetti Western in style, either.)

Keitel plays a well known gunfighter named Johnny Lowen, who has returned to the town he grew up in, and reunites with his son (whom he had abandoned 20 years earlier).  His son is an avowed pacifict and the town doctor, which creates even more tension between them.  To make matters infinitely worse, psychopathic gunslinger/killer Jack Sikora (Bowie) comes to town looking to put an end to the growing legend of Johnny Lowen and to build his own legend up in the process.  This is where some of the more unpleasant and (mildly) graphic parts of the movie occur.

Sikora is almost amoral in his willingness to kill, but he has a mean streak to go along with his inability to feel right or wrong.

The conclusion seems to work for some, but not for others.  For me it came across as an honest, realistic ending.  All the loose ends are tied up, but not in a forced way.

Gunslinger's Revenge is not without flaws (some of the dialouge is poor - not a lot, but some - some of the events feel a bit rushed, and some of the plot is a bit predictable), but on the whole it is a solid modern take on the Western, and fits in with some of the more recent Westerns that have been released (it's not all that far removed from the tone of Open Range, but as a film it's just not as good).

In the end, if your expectations are right (don't expect a great movie) then you'll likely find Gunslinger's Revenge to be an entertaining and touching Western.",1204934400,3,2280,4.495145631067961
2350204,2,B000A1OFYG,"Picture an ""After School Spaghetti Western Special"" and you'll have a pretty good idea what to expect with this. It's not exactly, ""Shane"". Bowie is an exaggerated stereotype of the psycho gunslinger replete with a trio of sycophantic miscreants, short-fuse temper, and a never-ending string of epithets.
 All the classic Grade B characters are present. The gentle half-wit, the prissy school m'a'rm,the dance hall girl with the heart of gold, and the aging gunfighter trying to hang it up.

Other than this distracting detail, the movie is a decent western with an unexpected conclusion. I was also surprised at how good of a bad guy cowboy David Bowie turned out to be. Bowie is very believable as a gunslinger calling out a legend who is tired of shooting and trying to retire. Bowie gives his Desperado role a unique twist with his unusual style.

Bowie and entourage were convincingly scary (sunglasses, earrings and all) and the little boy was priceless.

What can I say good about his movie?  The set was great.  It's pretty bad when the Native American actors steal the show from the main characters.  What's sad is they had everything together, the costumes, the scenery, the set.  I can imagine how much money they spent getting all of this together.  It's sad they had such a horrible cast.  All of that potential was wasted.  I rented this movie and I want my $3.00 back.  It was horrible.  I should've known with the title ""Gunslinger's Revenge"".  Harvey Keitel has been doing a lot of low-rent stuff lately and hasn't had a decent movie role in years.  They used the names of David Bowie and Harvey Keitel to promote this western.

young boy Jeremiah tells about his life in the town of Basin Field before his grandfather Johnny
Lowen and Jack Sikora, the crazy outlaw who seeks to kill Lowen comes to town.  I think this was an
homage to the Spaghetti Westerns, but it is more strange.  I would have liked a bit more with Lowen
and his son the town Doctor (even if it was a shouting match or a talk) and some with Lowen,
his son, and his grandson.  And this movie raises some questions, why does Jack Sikora speak
with a bad Southern accent (since Bowie is British)?  It would have made more sense if Sikora had
become an outlaw in England and after burning his bridges there, had been sent as punishment to
America? (or perhaps as a child, which could explain the bad accent).  I wish that we also had more
of time with Sikora's entourage - why did they stay with Jack and how did he bring them all together?
(though it is hilarious with the photograph taking of Sikora).  Lastly, I wish that we could have seen a

The actors including the boy, the main actor (central character), the slow guy, and hate to say so, David Bowie, are absolutely laughably horrendous!!!!! Harvey Keitel and the wife of the main actor are good, but not enough to save this picture. The music, by Pino Donaggio (probably most famous in America for the scores he did for Brian De Palma's films like Dressed to Kill, Blow Out and Body Double, was terrible and grated on my nerves, taking this film from a big fat 2 down to a lowly 1. I am a HUGE fan of David Bowie and enjoyed his acting in The Hunger and maybe a couple others, but here he was so bad it hurt. I don't mind swearing in a film but to hear him swear so blatantly and uncharacteristically added nothing to his character or the film whatsoever. How this film was advertized as a *Spaghetti Western* on Comcast is impossible for me to understand. It is the farthest thing from a *Spaghetti Western* I've ever seen. Though I'm a fan of some Hallmark films (usually those based on historically famous books like Moby Dick or those with a supernatural touch) this film is most like a BAD version of a Hallmark film. One of those films that tries so hard to be wholesome and ""good"" it doesn't make sense. Remember: this is a Western! With people who not only have guns but are obviously gonna use them! Possibly to kill! And thus why it is called, ""The Gunslinger's Revenge""(!!!!!) ---- it's very wholesome-ness goes against the very theme of the movie AND the genre it is in.
