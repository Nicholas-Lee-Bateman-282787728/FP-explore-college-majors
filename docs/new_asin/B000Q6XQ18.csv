2833015,5,B000Q6XQ18,"To those people going ""it's a bootleg, it's a bootleg"" I just got this in just a few minutes ago. Wanna know one of the first things I saw? That on the box it says that it's copyrighted. Geez, I don't know about you but I don't think a bootlegger would go to that much trouble. Not to mention the box doesn't look like a piece of crap, which if it was a bootleg it would.

Anyways, the only real problem with this is it isn't 4 DVDs, it's 3. I just got lucky and the person I ordered it from sent the fourth one too.",1192060800,9,516,3.8679245283018866
2833016,3,B000Q6XQ18,"This product isn't completely a bootleg....
Well that is to say its an official malaysian product if I'm not mistaken. ^^;;;
And it has episodes 1-71, if the picture is right and its the same set I've seen before.
It has chinese and english subtitles. They're not perfect, but readable no huge unreadable issues...
As for supporting the region 1 DVDs...
I know personally I'd love to buy all region 1 official releases... but i do NOT have the money, especially for a series as long as Bleach is going to be.",1190160000,6,508,4.532608695652174
2833017,4,B000Q6XQ18,"You are either mistaking Amazon for your Ebay purchase, you are 10 years old, or just plain simple-minded.  It's like saying you bought a knockoff Craftsman wrench from Sears.

It's pretty simple, Amazon, one of the world's largest online retailers, is not going to sell you a bootleg product.  Amazon isn't going to put their multi-million dollar business at risk by selling knockoff products.  If it really was a knockoff don't you think you woulda only paid $20 max?

2833018,1,B000Q6XQ18,"Region free means bootleg. You're wasting your money on pirated goods. The official DVD release is the region 1 released by Viz.

In comparison, look at this boxset. It doesn't list the company that made it. Doesn't say if it has subtitles. Doesn't say what the play time is. If you want to spend money on something that you know nothing about, you're just ripping yourself off.",1189209600,11,378,4.641791044776119

8194720,3,B000Q6XQ18,just to let u idiots know these dvds aren't bootleg....they just aren't US releases...they are IMPORT....they are factory made dvds by companies and are oficiall releases licensed and certified either by most of the time malaysia or japan....just because its an import does not mean its bootleg!! BOOTLEGS are discs that are burned by someone...these dvds are made in factory!!! get your facts straight!!,1355961600,,404,5.328125
8194721,1,B000Q6XQ18,"As everyone has said, this IS a bootleg. Only one company has EVER done universal release DVDs that were ligit, and they went under. Bleach is NOT one of their titles. Thus, you have the first clue that it is a bootleg. The second clue is, the fact that Rukia is spelled Lukia. If a company in Japan wanted to mechandize their stuff so it was international released, they would take time to garantee the quality, but the fact that there are other errors in there, is the second clue. I am writing this review, so people don't buy this, and go and support Tito Kubo the right way.",1280275200,,579,4.321100917431193
8194722,2,B000Q6XQ18,"This same product was listed on amazon about a year ago and I bought since I love bleach. This IS a bootleg people. For those of you who don't think so aside from the other reviews that give so many reasons, heres one for you. I speak japanese and the subtitles...they don't fit. This is a translation problem found in all the bootlegs from Honk Kong and mainland China. Had a similar problem with Saiunkoku Monogatarai and Ouran Hish School Host Club. All purchased here, all bootleg. Also, the names.... why in the world would the studio release the DVDs with incorrect names of characters? Save your money. Even if you don't speak Japanese, you are still going to get irritated  trying to peice together the broken verbage.",1261440000,5,726,4.671875
8194723,1,B000Q6XQ18,"First off all region 0 dvd are bootleg copies. They are made in Hong Kong, Tailand, Korea, or Malaysia. Otherwise they would be released in all the other regions as well. 2 when this dvd set came out it was not being sold by Amazon. It was being sold by a seller and only from sellers. You can create pages like this one from the sellers page if there is no other way to sell your item. This set showed up before the Official release. Usually when this occurs and it is a very popular series the Price is jacked up because it is the complete series. This also happened to Fushigi Yuugi, Kenshin and Inuyasha series. I also believe that this set showed up on Ebay as well at one point.

As far as quality - it is probably copies from VHS to DVD format which is not translated very well into English. Which means that the groups that are translating all the anime now a days didn't do this so that is another indication that this is a bootleg copy.

By now at the time of this review the Official region 1 release is out and so are box sets 1 and 2. For Quality just buy them.

Season 1 cost $27.99 from Amazon but you can find it cheaper used. (http://www.amazon.com/Bleach-Uncut-Season1-Box Standard/dp/B0015XHQUS/ref=cm_cr_pr_sims_t)

Season 2 cost $39.99 from Amazon but it is also cheaper used.

There is also the Bleach Movie 1: Memories of Nobody (2006) - $20.00 from Amazon and cheaper used.
http://www.amazon.com/Bleach-Movie-1-Memories-Nobody/dp/B001BP14SK/ref=pd_bxgy_d_img_c

If you are thinking of paying $300 dollars here for this bootleg you might as wait for it all to come out in Region 1. It will not cost you as much. The two seasons and the movie from Amazon cost less than $100. You will probably save $100 waiting for the region 1 releases.",1228348800,4,1844,4.894230769230769
8194724,3,B000Q6XQ18,"This dvd is definitely not bootleg, and the translations are terrible. It's an official box set, and the fourth disc is seperate from the box set packaging. But it was alot of bleach for cheap! Awesome!",1215129600,,202,4.638888888888889
8194725,1,B000Q6XQ18,"News flash for all the wonderful darlings that are saying this isn't a bootleg, it is. THERE IS NO OFFICIALLY RELEASED DVDs THAT ARE REGIONLESS!!! Don't say just 'cause it's on Amazon it must be okay (people used to say the same thing about eBay) I have seen plenty of bootlegs on both (look up Ronin Warriors, the boxsets of the whole series are bootlegs) Or the other reason I saw right off the bat ""it's just in Japanese, that doesn't make it a bootleg"", no dub-track available, subtitles probably including chinese, yep, it's a HongKong bootleg, guarrenteed. I'm just amazed someone was dumb and/or crazy enough to actually list it as what it is, an illegal copy of copyrighted material.",1206576000,21,691,4.7190082644628095
8194726,2,B000Q6XQ18,"from the description of some other reviewers and the fact that I own Inuyasha and Rurouni Kenshin, bootlegged, bought a long time ago,...in this very website, chances are...no it actually is bootleg. I'm admitting to this because in my anime collection most of them are legit and those two are the only ones that aren't, it's just that series that boasts 200-400 episodes, I just can't buy all their damned dvd's, the fact is that I don't have that much money, around 50 or 80 episodes is fine with me, I'll buy legit, but not when the quantity is huge, and full of filler episodes. It has all the signs of it, though : all regions, only JP, with English and Chinese subtitles, and the fact that the translation is bad, therefore it hasn't been licensed in the US. Would bootlegs go that far to make their product seem legit? Yeah, they would, know from experience. Then again I might be surpised, but...if Viz got the license...would they share that same license with another ""company""?

Trust me, I don't find the Japanese language insulting, and to accuse someone of it is childish and insulting. But hey...you got a lot of episodes in this one, you can dodge the question if it's bootleg or not, and think of the ""quality"" and ""number"" of episodes in them...heh, I know how that feels, trust me...so I can't in good consience blame anyone, I did so myself years ago. However that stopped, simply because I got pissed at the this ""quality"" of the dvd and episodes. And I didn't want to ruin the industry too much. Even so, can't blame ya or give you an insulting veredict...but I can say it's a bootleg.",1206316800,7,1606,4.557093425605537
8194727,3,B000Q6XQ18,"I'm pretty sure this is a bootleg, almost all of the Anime DVDs Japan makes are region two. And half of those don't have English subtitles let alone English subtitles and NO JAPANESE SUBTITLES. Who would do that? And if you're saying you think this can't possibly be bootleg because it's being sold on Amazon. Amazon does let users sell their stuff you know, and it is stated Bootleg in the title so that Amazon isn't responsible for it.",1204156800,8,437,4.544303797468355
8194728,5,B000Q6XQ18,"The Good News.
It's an excellent set.  No, it's not a bootleg.  The original series is in Japanese, this set is the first 95 episodes of Bleach in Japanese with English or Chinese subtitles.  It's all region so they can sell it to Japanese, Chinese, American and European buyers.  Yes, the subtitles mean you'll have to read them if you don't speak Japanese.  Since the English dubbed versions split the episodes up into 20 or so episodes per season and charge about $60 for each, it also means you get four seasons for the price of one if that one were dubed in with English voices.  With a new kid on the way, I don't have a huge anime budget, so this is great for me.  Plus, I've been watching them since subtitles were the norm, so no big deal.

The Bad News.
If you can't read, the subtitles will be a problem.  More to the point, the subtitles are not particularly good translations.  Japanese doesn't differentiate between L and R sounds that exist in English, and different translaters doing different episodes picked different sounds pretty much at will.  So one one episode, characters may be called ""Orihime"" and ""Rukia"", and in the next be called ""Olihime"" and ""Lukia"", depending on how each translator decided to go with it.  I have no idea why they didn't give a master list of translated character names to each translater.  Also, pronoun usage in the translations is very poor.  Often, the pronoun ""he"" will be used when ""she"" or even ""I"" would have been correct.  Several titles and such will also be different for those used to the English dubbing.  The ""Soul Society"" is called the ""Soul City""; ""Soul Reapers"" and called ""Deaths"", and a few others.  Still, these are minor changes and don't really damage one's ability to understand the storylines.

Also, don't expect much in the way of special features.  Each case has three disks with about 8 episodes on each, not leaving a lot of room for things like bonus features, extras, or even particularly good indexes.  You turn it on, you get a list of episodes, and that's about it.

Again though, for myself, who am looking to get as many episodes as possible, and don't mind reading them, this is a fantastic set that not only costs a fraction of the cost of the English dubbed version, but also carries the story much farther along, as I don't believe the English dubbed versions are anywhere near catching up to all the original Japanese versions.

All in all, and excellent purchase.",1200268800,14,2455,4.6342592592592595
8194729,2,B000Q6XQ18,"What ppl really need to know about this product is not if it's a bootleg or not, but the actual quality. The translation is really rough, it seems to be a literal translation instead of working english and can get confusing at times. The image quality is sub-par and doesn't seem up to dvd standards. That said, if you can't afford this many episodes (I got 4 discs 95 episodes) you might have try to make it work. All in all i was still a bit disappointed.",1196985600,8,457,4.264367816091954
