Zeorymer can kinda show why... its extremely artistic, creative, eye catching, and overall just plain neato. even though there is only two volumes of two episodes each making 4 of a series, its still amazing! the ending and opening are catchy and the story is pretty cool with an odd but cool twist at the end. it might not be everyones cup of tea but it sure was one of mine!",1389830400,,434,4.240963855421687
8299070,3,B00009WVNH,"While not the greatest anime in terms of plot, complexity or surprises, Zeorymer is entertaining mecha action with some interesting mechanical, character and costume designs.  Not a true gem of the genre but well worth the discount price it can be found for these days.",1346025600,,269,4.977777777777778
