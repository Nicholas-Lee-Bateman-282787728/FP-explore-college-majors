8317137,4,B001L487VS,"This is a good sample collection to start with if you are interested in how the mood of the country was portrayed in film at the time. The Internet Archive has all these available, and many more, for free download if you want to burn your own DVD compilations. We missed the full-blown 'duck-n-cover' thing at our school (or o/w didn't go quite that far)when I was in 3rd-grade in 1960, but everyone was well-aware of atomic-bombs, Korea, WW2, etc., Difficult to describe the generalized fear that existed--- Its only in hind-sight that one (myself) really appreciate how destructive these weapons are, ...it was all just the-way-it-was.
--These are historical & edited, but accurate representations of actual events. It is always important to view all such historical video in its entirety, instead of the usual edited clips.",1296345600,,826,5.036496350364963
8317138,5,B001L487VS,"I would not characterize these Civil Defense films as 'scary' or 'weird' as do others.  An enemy attack is just that, whatever form it may take.
The civil defense information in these films remains completely valid and could save your homes and lives.  If you happen to be outside the blast area of an attack, which most people would be, all information given in these well made government films is completely valid.  It is also good information for other disasters like housefires.  your local fire department will tell you the same things.  The threat of attack has not ended and all citizens should take these steps to protect themselves.

I am a certified state and federal instructor/first responder for WMD Nuclear/Radiological Emergencies as well as a filmmaker.",1283817600,2,769,5.015748031496063
8317139,5,B001L487VS,"These atomic bomb films of the 50s are absolutely frightening, even more so today, because there are so many more countries that have them. The effects of radiation,blast,heat, etc. are discussed by detached narration. Some of the shorts imply that the bomb is not that big a problem, others in the collection are more honest. But they are all fascinating and creepy!",1241049600,3,367,4.935483870967742
8317140,5,B001L487VS,"This collection of shorts about the atom bomb and how to survive is weird, scary, creepy, sometimes informative, but always fascinating. It's such a compelling topic, and who is to say that we will but have an atomic attack in our lifetime? The shorts included are  1-Duck and Cover- , a notorious film with Bert the Turtle telling schoolchildren how to protect themselves.
2-About Fallout
3-Operation Cue-watch mannequins in army constructed homes get blown to smitherenes in the desert!
4-Radiological Defense- Shelters and canned goods for all!
5-Stay Safe, Stay Strong- The effects of gamma rays and nuclear weapons. Don't worry if one is accidently dropped in your backyard. It probably won't go off!
6-Operation Ivy-Watch a hydrogen bomb vaporize the Pacific!
7-Tale of 2 Cities- The devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are seen in this amazing footage.
  Warning, you may not be able to sleep at night after watching this collection!",1226620800,6,942,5.184210526315789
