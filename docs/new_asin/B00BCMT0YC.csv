Overall Thoughts: For WWE's first DVD to feature rivalries, it wasn't too bad but could've been so much better. There were plenty of great rivalries that were still absent from this DVD and should've been included (e.i Jericho vs Michaels, Flair vs Sting, etc). Plus, some feuds that made it on the set don't even get a match. Not one match from the Kane vs Undertaker feud or E&C vs Hardyz vs Dudleyz feud?? Could've been a better set by far, but nonetheless it's still a decent dvd set to pick up",1363219200,4,3105,4.469534050179211

I am not going to buy this set since it is very disappointing so I am going to ask my friend to buy it for me

5578155,4,B00BCMT0YC,"This dvd was very good, Could not expect more, that being said if you have as many WWE DVDs like I do then some of the interviews are repetitive as well as the matches.",1393977600,,168,3.9705882352941178
5578156,3,B00BCMT0YC,Good clip show. Enjoyable but forgettable. The framing segments by Renee Young - who I usually love - were a bit eyeroll worthy.,1391212800,,128,4.608695652173913
5578157,4,B00BCMT0YC,This 3 set DVD is a must have for any true wrestling fan. It shows some of the best rivalries in history. I would have given it a 5 star rating but in my opinion there were some great rivals that weren't included.,1388707200,,213,3.9767441860465116
5578158,4,B00BCMT0YC,looks great but haven't watched it yet since this is going to be a Christmas present for a family member so shall tell you more after Christmas,1381190400,,143,4.333333333333333
5578159,5,B00BCMT0YC,"My son is a big fan of WWE Wrestling. Ever since he was able to understand what goes on he has followed it right to the present. His favorite Wrestler
 is John Cena. But ask him about the earlier wrestlers and he could write a book!!!!! Honestly could because his memory of old wrestlers is awesome!!!!
  There were some I myself have forgotten but he knows who they are.  He enjoys this very much. if you are a wrestling fan and watch RAW on Monday nights or
Smackdown then you really should get this DVD. Well worth it.",1379116800,,521,4.285714285714286
5578160,1,B00BCMT0YC,"I watched this DVD on Netflix last night and I have to say it's another one of Vince's exclusive DVD where only his organization is credited with anything related to wrestling. Hogan/Andre, Hogan/Piper a rivalry, really? A rivalry doesn't occur just for a short period of time as a lot of these would be considered just feuds for the sake of storyline. Examples of a good rivalry is Dusty Rhodes and the Four Horsemen. It was not just one man against another, Dusty (the voice of the people) was fighting against corporate greed and control in the wrestling world which went on from 1985 to 1988 or so. Steamboat/Flair but you have to go way back before 1989 to 1978 when Steamboat beat Flair for the TV belt. Flair and Valentine bruising Steamboat's face on the floor then Steamboat stripping Flair from his three piece suit. Hogan/Heenan going back to the AWA days where Heenan had his stable to try and prevent Hogan from taking the title from Bockwinkle, then continuing on to the WWF. Sad DVD to say the least but like a lot of folks have said a regurgitation of moments from past DVDs. So many moments that have yet to be remembered but then we know who's hoarding the memories.",1378684800,,1184,4.563380281690141
5578161,2,B00BCMT0YC,This DVD has way too many newer rivalries from the WWE. The biggest omission here is the Tommy Rich vs Buzz Sawyer feud from the NWA back in the early 80's. Also what about the Larry Zbyszko vs Bruno Sammartino feud ? They put just enough older stuff on here to make you want to buy it.,1378598400,,286,4.035087719298246
5578162,5,B00BCMT0YC,"it went into great detail into some of the greatest rivalries of all-time ,some I did not know about very entertaining.",1372377600,,119,4.714285714285714
5578163,5,B00BCMT0YC,this blu-ray is very good but it has not en Old School matches  and rivalries not on this blu-rays is up to you to bye,1372118400,,118,3.72
5578164,1,B00BCMT0YC,"First of all, where's Steve Austin-Bret Hart? Secondly, Cena has never been in even a mediocre rivalry-the golden boy supposedly has been in 2 of the best 25 in history? Also, I guess the WWF/E is essentially the entire wrestling business, also, as 18 of the 25 were WWF/E programs. Finally, the Orton-HHH rivalry was lousy(and I'm a fan of both of them). I suppose take these WWE DVD releases for what they are-- rewriting of history as they want you to see it.",1371772800,,462,4.511904761904762
5578165,3,B00BCMT0YC,"Macho Man Randy Savage vs Ric Flair rivalries is not listed here, this was a major feud that started in WWE and finish in WCW, not to mention Elizabeth love triangle. very dissaponted this feud not listed here. I guess Vince is still mad at Macho Man (no hall of fame inducation either)",1371168000,,286,4.415094339622642
5578166,4,B00BCMT0YC,"This Blu ray contains 2 discs. BR2 shows matches of those listed in the top 25 list. Blu Ray one is a show with the top 25. The list has fueds from WWE, AWA and NWA. It was well produced with many cameos. I of couse realize it is heavily loaded with WWE fueds from the last 20 years but did make a small attempt to cover other eras. In my opinion McMahon vs Austin in no way should be listed as the top rivalry of all time.",1370649600,,423,3.8181818181818183
5578167,4,B00BCMT0YC,"Storyline, feud, conflict...whatever you want to call it, it's best known as a rivalry and it's the one thing that draws money & attention more than anything in any type of sport or entertainment and there have been a countless number of them in the history of wrestling & WWE gives you their opinion on what are the greatest rivalries of all time.  I won't give away the list for those who don't want to be spoiled (it's listed on another review) but I can tell you that WWE's newest reporter Renee Young host this DVD using a theme of chemistry (complete with wearing a lab coat) & being no different than previous countdown sets where each one is showcased through archival footage & one person speaking on the rivalry as either a fan or a third party such as ""Road Dogg"" Jesse James, Shane Douglas, Vickie Guerrero, Mick Foley, Ted Dibiase Jr., Paul Heyman, Bret Hart, Cody Rhodes, Gene Okerland, Jerry Lawler, Joey Styles, Michael Hayes, Billy Gunn, Lita, C.M. Punk, Dusty Rhodes, William Regal, Jim Ross, Shawn Michaels, Ric Flair, The Miz, Big Show, ex-NWA referee Tommy Young, Dolph Ziggler, and Vince Russo but not one person spoke on their own feud.  It should also be noted that outside of the bonus matches, there are no other extras on the regular version but a segment where Shawn Michaels plays his own ""tribute"" to Undertaker is on the Blu-Ray.

Matches Include:
WWE Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Roddy Piper - This was the main event of the big television special held on a new network called MTV that was full of celebrities like sports announcer Bob Costas as the ring announcer, actor Mr. T in the crowd, and musician Cindy Lauper & Dave Wolfe & Capt. Lou Albano in Hogan's corner while Roddy Piper had Bob Orton in his corner with his arm in a sling from his match earlier (which began him wearing the cast on his arm for close to a year). Both men started right away trading fist with Hogan getting control & even resorting to biting before Piper regained it with kicks to the head & dirty tactics of his own like choking on the ropes & eye rake while Orton tried to get involved only for Hogan to attack his arm causing ally Paul Orndorff to come to ringside in Piper's corner. This was a straight brawl from start to finish that go so out of hand that the referee was knocked out & security was called to the ring but it did it's job in building towards the very first WrestleMania.

[Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology; Born To Controversy: The Roddy Piper Story; Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 80's]

Steel Cage ""I Quit"" Match: United States Champion Tully Blanchard vs. Magnum T.A. - For those fans who are old enough to remember or just heard by reputation, when asked what was one of the most violent matches of all time...this is mentioned. For it's time, this was hardcore before hardcore was defined as a match that needed a heavy amount of weapons/props & dangerous high spots. This was just two men aggressively beating the living ""crap"" (and I'm putting that nicely) out of each other until one man said ""I Quit""...if your a fan of the later Flair/Funk ""I Quit"" or Hart/Austin Submission match then you'll love this encounter.
Starrcade '85
[Bloodbath: Wrestling's Most Dangerous Steel Cage Matches; Starrcade: The Essential Collection]

Bruiser Brody vs. Abdullah The Butcher - Brody came out & started beating of Abdullah right from the start with a metal gas can that busted him open with Brody constantly stomping on the cut before Abdullah came back using an object in his hand to cut Brody over his eye and ripping at it with his hands as these two made their way from the ring into the crowd brawling non-stop & getting out of control.  The match itself wasn't much but it was short & effective.
""World Class Championship Wrestling"" July '87

Badstreet Rules Match: Kevin & Kerry Von Erich vs. Terry Gordy & Buddy Roberts - This started out with a bang as Kerry was fist fighting with Gordy & whipping Roberts with a strap before all four men started brawling on the floor with suplexes & slams & using a boot to beat on each other before Gordy was delivering chairshots to Kerry.  The fight continued back in the ring with some hard hitting moves like the piledriver, a foreign object used, and associates of both teams getting involved leading to a huge multiman brawl as this match was a glorified street fight & definitely showcased the heavy amount of heat between both teams.
""World Class Championship Wrestling"" Feb. '88

Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan & Randy Savage) vs. Mega Bucks (Ted Dibiase & Andre The Giant) - Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura was the special guest referee for this match with the suspicion throughout the night being if he took a payoff from Dibiase.  The Mega Powers started off working over Dibiase & kept control with quick tags before Andre was able to tag in & use his size to his advantage working over Hogan with chokes while Dibiase kept Hogan down with a chinlock.  Savage was able to get the advantage back over Dibiase only for Andre to take it right back with eventually Andre & Dibiase working over Hogan & Andre at the same time which eventually led to Miss Elizabeth resorting to tactics that caused everybody from the Mega Bucks to Bobby Heenan & Virgil to even Ventura (along with some of the fans) to just stop dead in their tracks.  This was a fun tag match.
SummerSlam '88
[Macho Madness: The Ultimate Randy Savage Collection]

Undertaker vs. Mankind - Mankind had attacked Undertaker for months, starting on the RAW right after WrestleMania, and was able to constantly render him unconscious with the nerve hold of the mandible claw. so Taker was more hellbent on revenge than we've seen him before which played out right from the start as Taker attacked Mankind from behind before taking it into the ring & punching him down with more fury than ever before. This evolved into a slow paced brawl with Taker even going for Mankind's mask at one point before Mankind was able to recover & deliver punishment of his own like a running knee smashing Taker's face between his knee & the steel steps before Taker was able to retaliate with an unprotected chairshot right to the head. Before this point in Taker's career, a majority of his matches were against bigger men who were very limited in what they can do in the ring but then came Mankind who definitely brought a more ""hardcore"" fight & style where he used his own body as a weapon which made one line Jim Ross said summarize this match perfectly, ""THIS IS WARFARE!"" as this was most intense & physical match in Taker's career up to this point.
King Of The Ring '96
[Undertaker's Deadliest Matches]

Sabu vs. Taz - This was called ""The Grudge Match Of The Century"" as this match was build for over a year dating back to their issues going on 2 years earlier to the point where Sabu came straight to the ring without his typical entrance. Both men went back & forth wrestling with Taz even daring Sabu to take his leg at one point before catching him in a body scissors with vicious crossfaces that ended up breaking Sabu's nose. Sabu used this daredevil offense like the double jump springboard into the crowd followed by brawling in the audience while Taz was sticking to this wrestling like the freestyle bow & arrow stretch while also countering Sabu's offense like throwing Sabu off a swinging DDT attempt that sent Sabu through a table. Taz made his clear that he was going after Sabu's previously injured neck with his various Tazplexes that landed Sabu directly on it while even Sabu tried to beat Taz at his own game applying the Tazmission at one point. This did come off as a grudge match with how hard & stiff each other were going after each other but it was the aftermath that had everyone talking as it changed both men's careers forever.

[ECW: Extreme Revolution; ECW Unreleased Vol. 1]

Tommy Dreamer vs. Raven - Tommy Dreamer had never scored an official victory over Raven throughout their entire feud in ECW & this was his final opportunity to do so as it was no secret (based off the ""YOU SOLD OUT!"" chants) that Raven was leaving to go to WCW.  The fight got taken to the outside of the building back in within the opening minutes as the brawled through the crowd with Dreamer thrown off the bleachers through the merchandise table, both men thrown into guardrails, Raven hit with a legdrop takedown, and both men bleeding.  They made their way back to the ring after a few minutes where the fight continued with both men trading low blows & the females at ringside going at it along weapons coming into play like a drop toe hold onto a chair & later one man launched off the top rope onto the open chair & a road sign taking out more than one person followed by a piledriver on it.  While this could be debated if this was their best match from an in-ring standpoint, no denying this was the most emotional encounter they ever against each other heavily playing into the factor that it was Dreamer's last chance.
ECW WrestlePalooza '97
[Rise & Fall Of ECW]

Ladder Match: Steve Austin vs. Mr. McMahon & Shane McMahon - During this time, Mr. McMahon revealed himself to be the ""Higher Power"" behind The Corporate Ministry only for Linda & Stephanie McMahon to quickly reveal that they gave their ownership of WWE to Steve Austin setting up this match with a briefcase at stake (where have I seen this recently?) containing the paperwork for complete ownership of the WWE. Austin attacked both men in the isleway early before taking the fight to the stage area where Austin dominated to the point where he literally ""brought the house down."" With the use of the announce tables & some mysterious interference, this wasn't the type of ladder match you would expect from people like the Hardys, Dudleys, or Edge & Christian but it was a brawl that you would expect from Stone Cold with some comedic moments & being able to take a beating that you would expect from both McMahon's.
King Of The Ring '99
[McMahon; The Ladder Match 2: Crash & Burn]

WWE Champion Triple H vs. The Rock w/special referee Shane McMahon - This was Rock's rematch from WrestleMania after Mr. McMahon screwed him out of the title that night but the odds were stacked against him with Shane McMahon as the referee, Stephanie & Mr. McMahon in Triple H's corner, and Steve Austin not being in The Rock's corner like he was advertised to be. This was intense from the opening bell as they traded momentum with Triple H going for the pedigree early before being able to take advantage using the steps & announce table on the outside while clearly cheating in-front of Shane who didn't do anything about it while Mr. McMahon got his hits in as well throughout the match whenever The Rock would start to gain momentum. The Rock caught a break when Triple H hurt his shoulder which The Rock targeted both in & outside the ring but Shane refused to count causing The Rock to take matters into his own hands before Mr. McMahon called for backup before some help finally came The Rock from people who had their own issues against Triple H & the McMahons. This was the type of non-stop action main event expected from these two with all of the outside parties contributing to the match instead of distracting from it.
Backlash '00
[The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man In Sports Entertainment]

WWE Champion Steve Austin vs. The Rock - This was their first match against each other since Austin aligned with Mr. McMahon to take the WWE Championship from The Rock at WrestleMania X-7 & the Steel Cage Match the next night on RAW before he was suspended with the added story of now Austin being a member of the WCW/ECW Alliance & The Rock a member of the WWE.  Austin attacked Rock from behind before Rock was able to get control  with a clothesline & neckbreaker as they fought their way up the rampway with Austin taking a suplex & backdrop on the stage before fighting back down to ringside with Austin using whatever he could at ringside to work over Rock from the ringpost to the announce table & the camera cables while also constantly taunting the fans as Austin continued to work over Rock in the ring keeping him grounded with a Boston Crab & chinlock before they traded momentum with both men using the sharpshooter at one point.  While this wasn't as high of quality as their more well known WrestleMania series & the Backlash match, it was still a quality match between both men.
Rebellion '01

WWE Champion Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar - The rematch from WrestleMania XIX with the difference here being that Brock Lesnar was the heel after recently turning against Angle after Angle won his WWE Championship in a triple threat match against Big Show the previous PPV.  Angle kept taking Brock down & grounding him with a front facelock & side headlock while also tossing Brock around with various armdrags that caused Brock to lose his tempter to the point where he was throwing the steps at ringside as Angle followed him to the outside fighting down the isleway.  They made their way back into the ring with both men exchanging various suplexes before Brock tossed Angle over the top to the floor & focused on his back with high impact moves like a tilt-a-wirl backbreaker & high cradle backdrop along with a grounded body scissors but Angle kept going for quick pins & focusing on Brock's shoulder.  The momentum went back & forth  such as Brock's spinebuster & later doing an F5 on one leg while Angle had a counter for the F5 followed by an Angle Slam & anklelock along with his unique body sleeper hold.  Compared to their WrestleMania & Iron Man Match, this match is forgotten about but this was a lost classic & definately lived up to the quality expected from both men in their series throughout the year.
SummerSlam '03

Steel Cage Match: WWE Champion John Cena vs. Edge - Cena came into this match with an injured arm & Edge heavily focused on that arm with kicks, using the ropes to stretch it out, and various armbars. Cena's arm was hurt to the point where it hurt to do his own offense such as his ""throwback."" At one point Cena tried to escape the cage only using his good arm before Edge yanked him down via his bad arm & applied a variation of the crossface. Cena kept fighting back with one arm delivering a bulldog off the top rope & his belly to belly suplex but Edge kept going after Cena's arm & even threw him into the cage arm first. A chair got involved with a chairshot being delivered that sounded like a shotgun going off before outside interference played an important factor here. With Cena having a reputation of playing ""superman"" & no-selling, that wasn't the case here as they told a great story revolving around the injured arm.

[Greatest Steel Cage Matches]

(Blu-Ray) WWE Champion Triple H, Batista, Shane McMahon vs. Legacy - This was a unique setup here in that Triple H defended the WWE Championship in a six man tag with Orton winning the championship if any member of Legacy scored the win.  With Hunter & Batista & Shane all went directly after Orton right away to the point where Orton was beaten all the way backstage leaving Legacy alone to take a beating before Orton came back & attacked from behind giving Legacy control as they singled out Batista & eventually Shane as well working as a team to ground & isolate them from their partners before eventually all six men were involved in the match with Cody using a chair only for Triple H to react when one of his partners wanted to give a receipt knowing it would cost him the championship.  This was a good six man tag match that not only showcased Legacy as a collective unit but also played into the story going into the match about Triple H's partners being out for themselves to hurt Orton regardless if it cost Triple H his WWE Championship.

(Blu-Ray) WWE Champion C.M. Punk vs. John Cena - WWE Champion C.M. Punk vs. John Cena - Paul Heyman gave an introduction to ""his guy"" in Punk before his entrance while Punk work N.Y. Yankees style gear & held up the championship for an extreme amount of time just to get under the skin of the crowd. Both men went back & forth with some wrestling early with Punk showing off to the point where he walked on Cena to go to the top rope which Cena had a response to in attempting an electric chair that was countered into a DDT by Punk followed by taking a page out of Great Muta's playbook with a his variation of a chinlock. Cena got more aggressive throwing Punk into the crowd near his Dad before suplexing him back to ringside with Cena later going out of his comfort zone by doing a suicide dive onto the outside onto Punk. Both men were matching each othe move for move & counter for counter like Punk at one moment caught Cena in the middle of one of his trademark moves into the anaconda vice that was rolled over into an STF that was countered into a crossface & later Cena was able to counter a GTS attempt into the STF before another GTS attempt that countered into an A.A. Both men kept kicking out of each others signature moves while also attempting to aerial with Cena's top rope legdrop & Punk with a moonsault to the point where Punk even took a page out of The Rock's playbook to no avail. Punk is one of those people who can pull the best wrestling performance out of Cena & that continues to be showcased here as this was on the level of their previous Money In The Bank & SummerSlam matches from last year with the only downfall being the finish but it opened the door for another match which is something I wouldn't object to.
Night Of Champions '12
[Best PPV Matches Of 2012]

This was one of my favorite subjects for a countdown set as WWE didn't just limit themselves to their own company but used their vault to remind us of classic rivalries that most fans who either didn't have access to watch it or just wasn't around when it happened along with giving us background on what we saw in-front of the camera but also some stories told about what happened behind the camera as well which translated on screen (like the real life heat between Tully & T.A. that I never knew about) along with some people giving a different side of how the feud went down (Big Show & C.M. Punk speaking on Hogan's feuds).  One negative about this set is that some of feuds selected I just don't see the justification in it (Punk/Cena was more about Punk's ""pipebomb"" than their actual feud), some feuds being left out completely (Sting/Flair, WCW/nWo, Midnight Express/RnR Express, Jericho/Michaels or maybe have it be Dusty/Horsemen instead of it being just limited to Dusty/Flair).  The other negative is that I felt like the match selection had too many DVD repeats when they're so many matches from the feud that remain unreleased on a non-PPV set as they did a good job picking the matches of Lesnar/Brock or Austin/Rock in that they had yet to be released onto a DVD set such as Lita during the presentation talking about how Cena & Edge had so much better chemistry at house shows because they were allowed to experiment with each other & even showed footage of them having house show matches so give us a match from a house show, Cena/Punk have so many lost matches from RAW, or the Iron Man match from Rock/HHH which was highlighted in their selection.  In the end, heavy DVD collectors should stream or rent this to see the countdown but if you don't have many of the DVD's that the bonus matches are on them then pick this up.",1370217600,6,19491,4.548488305761552
5578168,4,B00BCMT0YC,"I'm a collector of WWE dvds so I picked up ""The 25 Greatest Rivalries in Wrestling History"" without hesitation, but with somewhat low expectations. A lot of the bonus matches had been released (although with mentions to the ""WWF"" edited out) on other compliation sets and I assumed the documentary would quickly skim through each feud and we would get stars like Santino or Brodus Clay making bad jokes throughout the feature. However, I was surprised and highly impressed with the quality of the main program.

Each feud is discussed by a different wrestling personality who was not directly involved in the feud, but is able to add a unique perspective to each rivalry. For instance, Shane Douglas discusses the Taz/Sabu feud and Vince Russo talks about the Austin/McMahon rivalry. I felt this was a cool way for WWE to go with this feature. Each rivalry gets between 6 - 10 minutes if disection and each commentator provides different types of insight. You'll hear backstage stories along with first-hand and historical perspectives towards each feud. Of course, some rivalries are surprisingly omitted (no Flair/Sting?) but overall I feel like each rivalry has earned it's place on this list.

As far as the bonus matches go, I stated previously that most of these matches are on other WWE dvd sets. However, the fact that all these matches are unedited (other than changes to licensed music like Stone Cold Steve Austin's Disturbed theme from 2001) makes a world of difference.

As far as the match ratings go:

WWE Championship Match - Hulk Hogan vs Rowdy Roddy Piper (The War to Settle the Score. 2/18/85) - This was a huge deal on MTV but the actual match is nothing special. However, it did lead to the main event of Wrestlemania 1, so it's historically significant. - 2/5 *

""I Quit"" Steel Cage Match for the NWA United States Championship - Tully Blanchard vs Magnum T.A. (Starrcade. 11/28/85) - Violent and physical match between these two. Not a lot of technical wrestling, but the brutality makes up for it. Great example of what an ""I Quit"" match should be. - 4/5

Bruiser Brody vs. Abdullah the Butcher (World Class Championship Wrestling. July 1987) - I had high hopes for this match after seeing their rivalry discussed in the main program. However it ends abruptly and we never really get to see much action. What we do see though is pretty good. A brawl. - 2/5

Badstreet Rules Match - Kevin & Kerry Von Erich vs Terry Gordy & Buddy Roberts (World Class Championship Wrestling. February 1988) - Another disappointing match after knowing how great this feud was. It's an entertaining brawl, but I was just expecting more. Still very good and appropriate for the Von Erich/Freebird feud. The post-match fight is pretty entertaining. 3/5

Hulk Hogan & Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage vs ""The Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase & Andre the Giant (Summerslam. 8/29/88) - Standard Hogan/tag team match here but it's highly entertaining. I always enjoy watching Savage wrestle. The match goes back and forth before the beautiful Miss Elizabeth exposes her bikini bottom and allows the Mega Powers to win. This is also the beginning of the ""Mega Powers Explode!"" storyline. - 3/5

The Undertaker vs Mankind (King of the Ring. 6/23/96) - Very physical match with Mankind really dishing out the punishment to Taker. At that time, no one had ever pushed the Deadman like Mankind had. Very good match and the best on disc 2. - 4/5

Taz vs Sabu (Barely Legal. 4/13/97) - Another physical match. Stiff shots, crazy high flying spots from Sabu, and high impact suplexes from Taz make for a brutal crescendo in this rivalry. The post-match with Rob Van Dam in fun to see. - 4/5

Tommy Dreamer vs Raven (WrestlePalooza. 6/6/97) - Entertaining ""garbage"" brawl between these two. They take the fight all over the ECW arena before DDTing each other into the mat several times. An appropriate end to their feud. 3/5

""Winner Take All"" Handicap Ladder Match - Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Vince & Shane McMahon (King of the Ring. 6/27/99) - Not a technical classic, but highly entertaining. Austin basically kicks both Vince and Shane's asses all over the arena. Fun match. 3/5

WWE Championship Match - Triple H vs The Rock (Backlash. 4/30/00) - Great match between these two. Shane McMahon is the special referee and Vince & Stephanie are at ringside, stacking the deck against The Rock. Very entertaining and Stone Cold Steve Austin makes his return after neck surgery at the end of this match. 4/5

WWE Championship Match - Stone Cold Steve Austin vs The Rock (Rebellion. 11/3/01) - Great match between these two (like always). It's cool to see Austin work as a heel against Rocky. Good back and forth action. 4/5

WWE Championship Match - Kurt Angle vs Brock Lesnar (Summerslam. 8/24/03) - Hard hitting match here. Great mix of technical wrestling and high impact moves. Vince McMahon takes a nasty Angle Slam onto a chair after this match. 4/5

Steel Cage Match for the WWE Championship - John Cena vs Edge (Raw. 10/2/06) - Cena and Edge had great chemistry and it shows here. Great storytelling with Edge focusing on Cena's injured arm throughout. Not a bloody cage match, but physical and very entertaining. - 3/5

Overall Rating: 4/5 - This is a highly enjoyable release from WWE. A near 3 hour documentary is complimented by some really strong match choices. It's not perfect. Some will argue about what rivalries were included and which weren't. It's also a shame we couldn't get a match higlighting each feud, but another disc would likely be required to do. I bought the DVD version but the Blu Ray contains two extra matches. They are Triple H, Batista & Shane McMahon vs The Legacy for the WWE Championship from Backlash 2009 and CM Punk vs John Cena from Night of Champions 2012. The six man tag team match is entertaining due to Randy Orton's crazy heel character. The match between CM Punk and John Cena is a boderline 5* match and is well worth a watch if you don't own that match already. Highly recommened set. Great job WWE!",1369872000,2,6032,4.773512476007678
5578169,3,B00BCMT0YC,"Not the most exciting production from WWE.  It could of have been better given the content and also if they had multiple people narrating each feuds instead of just one person.  There were a few segments that were good like HBK reflecting on the Flair/Rhodes feud, Vince Russo talking Austin/McMahon, CM Punk doing Hulk/Savage and a few others.  The rest of the documentary was stale unfortunately.",1369785600,,398,5.0
5578170,5,B00BCMT0YC,"I thought I would write a ""real"" review on this WWE release. It seems like most of these reviews are just match listings and were written before this collection was released. I would like to provide some insight on the finished product.

As almost always, this is another excellent WWE release. This release is especially enjoyable because of the way the countdown is presented. Renee Young does and excellent job steering the ship, and is also very easy on the eyes!!! The countdown clocks in at a little under 3 hours and each rivalry has a different WWE personality narrating. This allows the WWE personality to provide insight that was previously unavailable to the common fan. As mentioned above, Renee Young comes in every so often and provides additional insight. The rivalries themselves are very interesting and highlight all the important matches and moments of the rivalry.

The only flaw that this set has is the bonus matches. It seems like some are repeats. Also the number of matches seems a little weak compared to other previous WWE release. Overall this is another excellent set and I really enjoyed it. 5 stars!!!",1369785600,8,1132,4.890625
5578171,2,B00BCMT0YC,"First off naming Austin/Mcmahon as the greatest rivalry ever is laughable IMO, it wasn't even the best of the attitude era s Rock/Austin was better. Freebirds/Von Erichs while good is not top 25 of all time?  Also the match selection is brutally redundant. WWE Boasts how large their video library is yet they fail to make the best of those resources.  For those who might not be familiar with these feuds it could be a quick albeit factually challenged retrospective of these feuds.  I also feel that Savage/Roberts Sting/Vader Sting/Flair and Horsemen/Dusty were ignored to put WWE's golden boy Cena on yet another dvd.",1367193600,7,621,4.951923076923077
5578172,4,B00BCMT0YC,"Overall, this looks to be a decent and fairly solid listing, but there are 2 huge feuds missing from this:

1.  Anybody vs. The Midnight Express - arguably the best tag team in history, their feuds w/ R-n-R Express, Road Warriors, Dusty and Magnum T.A., and The Fantastics were some of the best I've ever seen.  I attended several matches in the 80's to see them, and the place was as insane as anything I've been to, and that includes Hulk Hogan and Steve Austin at their peak.

2.  Jimmy Valiant vs. Paul Jones - Sure, it's not as well knwon to newer fans, but it lasted a good 3 years and never got stale.  Should at least be an ""honorable mention.""

Just my 2 cents...",1364428800,7,672,4.285714285714286
