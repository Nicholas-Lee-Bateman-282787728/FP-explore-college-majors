3851352,5,B00265T7NS,"I've been using 7 or 8 of the Billy Blanks workouts for several years now and really love them. I am quite overweight and was looking for something challenging and yet not ridiculously hard for someone who is out of shape.  I was also looking for something that wouldn't be too hard on my  joints.  This workout does all that I had hoped for and more.  I have lost more than 75 pounds using the basic bootcamp model and have really gained a lot of strength, reshaping my body and building up my muscle.  The great thing about this workout is that it keeps challenging you.  The better in shape you become the more you are able to put into the workout and the more you're able to burn.  I really recommend buying the bands however.  They really are a valuable tool and supply the main ingredient for reshaping your body.

The beat of the music is good in the background and the tempo helps you keep in pace without overwhelming you.  Billy Blanks as a host also does a good job encouraging and leading you in the workout.  I was skeptical at first when I saw this advertised, but the workouts really won me over and I plan on buying everything Billy Blanks puts out.  So in conclusion, if you're  overweight (or simply out of shape) and are looking for a safe, inspiring, and challenging structured routine to help you meet your goals to get back in shape, I really think you'll like this product.",1274918400,22,1396,4.40625
3851353,2,B00265T7NS,"I did the ""Billy's Bootcamp 2"" part of the DVD and it is such a disappointment.  It's cheesy, and he talks way too much in between sets.  This wastes time and you don't get the hour workout you're suppose to get.  Your heart rate drops and you get a mediocre workout.  The description on the box says it's a hard workout, but it's not.  And another point, I thought this was taebo?  Doesn't that include kickboxing and the like?  We did squats, lunges, pushups, but hardly anything that resembles kickboxing.  There wasn't enough cardio and it was way too slow in my opinion.  I was hoping for fast paced kickboxing combos in the video set but I didn't get that, at least not in Billy's Bootcamp.  This hardly resembled a bootcamp at all besides the fact that they wore army gear.  Hopefully his cardio bootcamp will be better.  I also tried the abs section and it wasn't too bad.  Lots of twisting and awkward floor work.  Overall, what I've experienced thus far it is a terrible workout DVD.  It's a waste of my money.  I'm not buying his DVDs after this.",1254960000,4,1057,4.455497382198953
3851354,5,B00265T7NS,"Billy's boot camp is such a challenge but I love how he gives out ""orders"" but does it in such a way that you actually want to do the moves he says even if you are feeling you're hitting your final mile! He is a great coach and makes the people doing his exercises enjoy in engaging in a tough workout and end up feeling challenged instead of discouraged! It is fast paced but is just a bit slower than some other dvds I have seen him instruct. It would be a good video particularly if you are new to kickboxing and don't want the first dvd you pop in have you run from giving this exercise a chance! For me this first dvd on the matter was a good choice and would recommend anyone willing to try something new to be your next exercise dvd. You will enjoy it!",1379376000,3,759,4.066666666666666
3851355,5,B00265T7NS,"I have close to every Tae Bo workout and this is my favorite currently.  Three of the four workouts are good for a general workout, with emphasis on strength building (lots of push-ups and floor work) the last one is specifically for ab work.  A better job of not having a bunch of slow motion practice rounds and Billy can count a little better than normal so that is an improvement.  He can still do a better job of not talking so much.  Jillian Micheals actually talks more than Billy but she is not barking at you and repeating the same words over and over like Billy.  If we are buying these and doing them, by default we are already motivated, so shut-up and let me work-out!!!!",1371686400,,684,4.354330708661418
3851356,4,B00265T7NS,"Fun, energetic, enjoyable... easy to follow, each move is done with not too many reps before he moves on so you don't get bored",1369526400,,127,4.333333333333333
3851357,5,B00265T7NS,The DVD was in great condition with no scratches and good play time. The DVD is easy to follow and well worth the money. I just like being able to break up my routine and with the 4 in one I can incorporate it into my weekly routine and go to what ever level I wish.,1363737600,,266,3.767857142857143
3851358,5,B00265T7NS,"I haven't found or used a Billy Blanks video I didn't like. Every one, including this one, leaves me completely knowing I just workedy body. Billy has and will continue to be my favorite instructor and workout buddy.",1315699200,,216,4.7105263157894735
3851359,5,B00265T7NS,This DVD provides convenience by combining all 4 different workouts in one DVD. It saves you space and gives you the option to simply choose which workout is best on a particular workout day. Because I'm not a big abs workout fan I only interchange between the 3 workouts base on my mood and how I feel that day. I'm very contented with my purchase and have always enjoyed and find Billy Blank's workout videos the best!,1304899200,,420,4.467532467532467
3851360,3,B00265T7NS,"The dvd is ok, It arrived on time & I have only done the ab work out to date. It will definitely work with continual use.",1301788800,,121,3.6923076923076925
3851361,3,B00265T7NS,Good video if Billy would just shut his mouth.  He talks too much during the video and it's annoying!!!  But the exercises are good.,1300838400,,132,4.458333333333333
3851362,5,B00265T7NS,"Absolutely LOVE this DVD!  Granted, not much work went into creating it as his gang don't even know why they are there (for bootcamp of course), but I still love it!  I love that there are four different workouts on one DVD so I can pick the one that works for me any particular day and it helps prevent me from getting bored.  Not for the light-hearted - these really do work you to the bone!",1297555200,5,393,4.144736842105263
3851363,5,B00265T7NS,"I've enjoyed Tae-Bo and the bootcamp workouts are my favorite.  If you're looking to try Tae-Bo, I recommend you choose this DVD because you get 4 good workouts for a low price.  To get the full benefit of bootcamp, you absolutely need billy bands or resistance bands and if you choose resistance bands be sure you get duplicates (2 green, 2 red, etc.).  I'd rate this workout for beginner-intermediate.",1288915200,8,403,4.811594202898551

8351997,2,B00265T7NS,I love Billy's singles but this one has loud music in the background with the artist singing. It distracts from what Billy is saying in his instructions. I don't like that at all. But the other DVD's I have of his are not like that. But maybe some people don't mind it.,1392422400,,269,4.1923076923076925

8351999,5,B00265T7NS,"I can do this for a whole week and can never be bored with it. Once you get the hang of it, it's quite enjoyable. Am 20lbs lighter after 2 months of tae Bo. I work out for 6 straight days, practice portion control and cut out carbs from my diet to loose excess weight after the birth of my baby. Glad to be back to my pre-pregnancy body. Thanks Billy! I highly recommend.",1381276800,,371,4.027027027027027
