7731634,3,B01E6CE17A,"One of those rules of thumb is that movies aren't as good as the books they adapt. But there are exceptions. Howard Hawks' To Have and Have Not improves on Hemingway's book. Spielberg's Jaws is better than when Benchley penned it. There's Silence of the Lambs and The Shawshank Redemption. The Godfather. Stand By Me. So there's a few. Question is, does Wedding Planner Mystery, a Hallmark Movies & Mysteries jam that originally aired in 2014, fall in with such august company?

No.

Wedding Planner Mystery is based on Deborah Donnelly's novel Veiled Threats, first of (so far) six entries in her Carnegie Kincaid thrillers. I'm thinking Hallmark's plan was to parlay this movie into its own ongoing television franchise. I don't know about that. This is a dumb movie.

In Seattle, Carnegie Kincaid (Erica Durance) is trying hard to make a go of it as a wedding planner, never mind that her small business barely stays afloat. Always the bride's consultant, never the bride, Carnegie maybe has got herself to blame. She's hard to please. Her OCD craves symmetry. She's holding out for the picture perfect love story, never mind that it's rare that you get the moon and the stars. But let's table that mushy junk, because Carnegie's just been tapped as a person of interest after a bridesmaid is bumped off at a posh wedding and a bride is kidnapped. And, as if getting hassled by the police and by that seedy reporter from the Washington Sentinel weren't awful enough, Carnegie suspects that the real culprit is now out to get her, especially when the brakes of her company van fail, courtesy of tampering. But Carnegie's the plucky sort and she's got some resources, namely her librarian best friend Lily (Karen Holness) and, yeah, that pesky reporter (Andrew W. Walker). Maybe she can count on that hunky lawyer as an asset, except we all speculate that he's merely the obstacle to Carnegie's finding true love.

Sadly, as an amateur gumshoe, Carnegie is less than impressive. She mostly spends the film bungling around and applying faulty logic and accusing her friends willy nilly. I can't put my finger on it, but Erica Durance - whom I liked in Smallville - didn't hit for me this time out, and I wonder how much of my discontent boils down to crap writing that compels her to say crap dialogue. Some very silly and contrived stuff goes down, none more eye-rolling than the scene in which the sheer obliviousness of the personnel at the gym's check-in counter allows Carnegie to sneak over and access their computer. Wedding Planner Mystery tries to come across as bouncy and whimsical with a whiff of farce, a dab of romance. But it falls flat for me. I wasn't buying what the movie was selling. Somewhere along the way, Deborah Donnelly's keen prose got lost in translation. Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, of late, has ushered in a roster of intriguing amateur sleuths that range from a garage sale enthusiast (Lori Loughlin) to a small-town baker (Alison Sweeney) to a suave gourmet chef (Dylan Neal). I don't feel there's a need for an event planner to elbow her way in.",1462233600,4,3079,4.771106941838649

7731657,2,B01E6CE17A,"Just too much wrong with this movie, and I was so excited because I have always wanted to be a party planner, so I usually enjoy movies with Wedding Planners, its their organizational skills and quick thinking that really makes me happy to see. If Carnegie had used her thinking skills, maybe she wouldnt have accused so many of her friends of murder, and figured out was going on a lot sooner.

The first thing that really struck me as being odd/way off, is when the detective said it was Carnegies fault that the person died because she had served alcohol at a wedding. I don't know, maybe growing up in Wisconsin, where drinking is the number one pastime, my opinions are skewed, but I would think that there is some clause in a wedding planners contract that would say they are in no way responsible for people drinking.

So this sends her into a panic, and she tries solving the crime, and in the process accuses a lot of the people she knows. And afterwards, she doesnt even apologize. So while this is going on, she is wooed by a lawyer, and trying to fend off a reporter. To me the reporter was over the top at what a jerk he was being, and even though Carnegie kept denying him, when she does decide she likes him, its so fast that if they make any more movies from this series I can see them getting married.

Theres also something to be said about just using common sense. If you see someone being really nice to everyone, but then really mean to you, and then really nice again when someone walks into the room, you might want to suspect them.

The ending when we find out who did what, felt like a Scooby-Doo episode to me. The dialogue was terrible, and I thought one of the characters was actually going to say, And I would have gotten away with it, if it wasn't for you meddling kids.",1472774400,4,1800,4.332344213649852

7731662,4,B01E6CE17A,"I've been a huge Erica Durance fan since she was cast as Lois Lane on Smallville.  I will watch pretty much anything she's in (unfortunately, I haven't found much since Smallville ended) so I was really excited to see that she had starred in a Hallmark movie!  It's a good mystery with a rather predictable plot but overall, enjoyable. Good chemistry with both love interests (love triangle subplot going on, it's obvious from the beginning who she's going to end up with). This is not a hardcore, keep you on your toes kind of mystery.  More of a frothy, fun, and intriguing kind of mystery.

7731664,4,B01E6CE17A,"Im sure it will be no surprise to you that I have piles of books around the condo that Ive never found time to read.  They sound good, and I fully intend to read them, but other books come along and bump them down my TBR list.  One of those is the book Veiled Threats, the first in a series about a wedding planner by Deborah Donnelly.  No, I still haven't read the book, but I have seen the movie that Hallmark made based on it called Wedding Planner Mystery, and I really enjoyed it.

Carnegie Kincaid (Erica Durance) is a wedding planner who has just hit the mother lode for her business, the back to back weddings of two cousins in the Parry family.  They are rich and fairly famous in Seattle  or is that infamous?  Doug Parry (Billy Mitchel), father of the second bride Nicky (Chelan Simmons), is under investigation for tax fraud, and that has added a complication to both weddings.

But Nickys wedding is second and she is a bridesmaid in the wedding of her cousin Diane (Chelsey Reist).  However, that wedding ends in tragedy when their third cousin, Michelle (Barbara Kottmeier), takes off from the wedding early in Nickys car, crashes a block away, and dies.  Suddenly, the police are nosing around and Carnegie feels the heat of the investigation.  Can she solve the crime and save her businesss reputation?

This plot was quite complicated, and the way it twisted around kept me off guard.  However, it all made perfect sense in the end.  Well, one or two details got overlooked, although we can make educated guesses about them.  Still, the story was fun, and how everything unfolded was very easy to follow.

And I was surprised at how much I came to care for the characters.  When a book is turned into a movie, often the characters are the first casualty.  While Im sure they are all richer in the novel, there were several that stood out to me enough that I truly cared about how they would fare by the time the story ended.  Heck, even when Carnegie was alienating people over the course of her investigation, I understood her motives and truly felt sorry for her.

And the acting was decent.  I especially enjoyed seeing Erica Durance starring in this since Ive been watching her as Lois Lane is Smallville.  Even more fun, she has a constant nemesis in Aaron Gold (Andrew W. Walker), a reporter that would give Lois a run for her money.

Of course, this does have a liberal dose of the usual Hallmark cheese, and Carnegies narration didn't help with that.  But if you know that going in, youll enjoy it.

So far, this is the only movie I can find in the franchise, but I hope Hallmark changes that since Wedding Planner Mystery was so much fun.  And I definitely need to make the time to get the book read now, too.  (If I can find it, of course.)",1462233600,,2768,4.46215139442231
