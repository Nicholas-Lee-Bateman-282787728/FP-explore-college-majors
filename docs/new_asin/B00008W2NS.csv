7987274,3,B00008W2NS,Good show! But the dvd I got had a lot of scratches and it didn't play the shows on it very good!,1519344000,,97,3.4545454545454546
7987275,4,B00008W2NS,"This 1999 anime series centers around Yui Kasuga, a computer-illiterate 14 year old who ""accidently"" gets chosen to save her world and cyberspace from an evil super computer and his henchmen. With the help 8 special software programs, she becomes Corrector Yui, savior of the peace in the computer world of Com Net. The dub can be a little bland at first, but it gets better over time when volumes pass. The animation is done really well for its time (before digital coloring), Most of the characters are pretty loveable, and the OP theme song rocks my socks! Too bad we will never see all 52 episodes in America, for I would haved loved to see them all. But the 16 we have are very fun to watch, with pretty transformations and a cool plot (even if it is a bit unoriginal).",1216857600,,774,4.457746478873239
7987276,2,B00008W2NS,This anime I would consider for ages 10 up for the brief nudity. Sailor Moon is better then this cartoon looks like it belongs on Nickolean. Yui is not your average 21 century junior high school student she can't tell the difference between a computer chip and a potato chip. she's a girl who makes contact with IR. She has to save the world when an evil super computer threatens to take over the globle system.,1119052800,,411,4.421052631578948
