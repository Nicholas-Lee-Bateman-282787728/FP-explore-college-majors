3854384,4,B0026MBEG4,"I work out. I go jogging 2-3x a month or whenever I remember (which isn't often). While this workout plan was very convenient for me, it was not convenient for my waistline. Now the only pair of jeans I fit into are my 'fat jeans'. So I decided to step up my game to 2x/week of cardio, at least until I can fit into my other pairs of pants comfortably.

After five minutes of this DVD, my shirt was sweat-soaked and I was in pain. I thought, hey, what a great workout that was! And that's when Amy says ""Ok, great warmup, now let's get ready for the workout!"". I knew then that I had made a good purchase.

The moves in the DVD are not complicated, but it is choreographed and it will certain help if you know the difference between a jab, hook, roundhouse, and axe. However, if you watch and follow the DVD a couple of times, you will be able to pick up the moves fairly quickly.

I got through about 1/2 of the actual workout. I had to stop because 1) my legs were wobbly, and 2) there was still the cool-down, core, and stretching to do. I definitely recommend the core moves. I can't even laugh because my abs are sore. I didn't even know my abs could be sore before this DVD!

The only gripe I have is that the quality of the DVD seems a bit homemade. However, the workout itself is great and compared to gym memberships, this is a great investment.

Just make sure you have enough space to do front and back kicks while you are working out. You'll see what I mean.",1248652800,6,1470,4.161971830985915
3854385,5,B0026MBEG4,"This is a phenomenal workout!!! It is definitely an advanced kickboxing workout with moderately complex choreography. Once you complete the workout a few times, the moves will become intuitive! I can guarantee that your heart rate will be within (sometimes above) your training zone.

When done its entirety, the workout is 79 minutes long. It is composed of a 9 minute warm up, 51 minutes of kickbox rotations (5 segments with a SURGE at the end of each one). The SURGE takes your heart rate up a notch, and they are relatively short in duration.

The DVD is structured so that you can perform the total workout, complete surges only, complete rotations 1-3 with strength. There are at least 5 options available. I put this DVD in when I want to guarantee a HIGH calorie burn!",1243900800,3,777,4.705882352941177
3854386,5,B0026MBEG4,"I finally had the opportunity to try Kick Box Surge this morning--I LOVE IT!  Many of the moves were not as complex as I assumed (I did preview it twice, however), but I'm still working on my ""fake side kick"" and having fun trying.  My heart rate was a lot higher than I expected and it certainly passed my ""bandana test"":  if I have to squeeze perspiration from it and change it after a cardio session, I've definitely had a good workout.  The music is awesome--I'm still hearing the soundtrack while sitting at my desk.

The core refining session is unique and effective--I really enjoyed this section of the workout.  I had to modify the ""deck squats"", but I'm going to work on mastering those by using the section in Amy's Kettlebell Dynamics video.  Although In The Ring and Hi Lo Knockout remain my favorites of her floor routines, Kick Box Surge is a fantastic addition to my rotation.",1243814400,,892,4.572327044025157
3854387,5,B0026MBEG4,"This is my FAVORITE Amy Bento Kickboxing workout! I did this one today and I LOVE IT! The music rocks too! It was much easier to follow this one then Kickbox Xtreme. If you want a GREAT kickboxing workout that's fun and the music is great, this is a MUST! Amy did a great job!",1242432000,,276,4.036363636363636
3854388,5,B0026MBEG4,Advanced kickboxing but easier to follow than Kickbox Xtreme with fun and motivating hit music and one of the most pleasant instructors around - I love Amy! The short but challenging ab section uses an 8 lb. med ball that adds nice intensity. Excellent workout!,1241395200,,261,4.822222222222222
8353100,5,B0026MBEG4,"WOW, this workout is amazing! Other reviewers have explained its basic structure already, so I won't go into too much detail. The warm-up is about 10 minutes, and then Amy takes you through 5 combos; each combo is followed by a ""surge"" (higher intensity cardio blast). Uchenna (sp?) is the background exerciser who shows the modifications. The core section uses an 8-lb medicine ball; I usually substitute a dumbbell without a problem, but for some of the moves, you really need a ball.

Amy is a great instructor - probably one of my favorite, along with Cathe, Kelly Coffey Meyer, Shaun T, and Jillian Michaels. She sings along to the music sometimes, which was entertaining and not at all a negative.",1383264000,,703,4.809917355371901
8353101,5,B0026MBEG4,"I absolutely love this workout (can you tell?)!! Amy is an awesome instructor, the music is great and the workout is incredible! I love kick boxing and I look forward to the days that I workout with Amy! She has great cues, her combinations are fresh and I love the 5 cardio workouts followed by the surge workouts- kicks my booty! As Amy says, ""The sweat is flying!"" I have to do a lower impact version of the workout and her modifier did an okay job modifying the moves, but be aware that there are some moves the modifer does that you may not be able to do if you have back or knee problems. All in all, it's a fantastic workout! You won't be disappointed!",1333670400,,659,4.238095238095238
8353102,5,B0026MBEG4,"I purchased this almost a year ago and only did it a few times since. I remember seeing a few reviews saying 5 minutes into the DVD and they were sweating and out of breath, oh and it was just the warm up.  Well I just got back into it again and thought... omg that was the warm up?? I forgot how much fun this DVD was and it reminds me of when I used to do Body Combat at the gym.  They do not offer it at my new gym so I'm glad I bought this! I wouldn't suggest this DVD to those who don't really work out, definitely medium to advanced.",1322611200,,539,3.7610619469026547
8353103,5,B0026MBEG4,"I ordered this dvd because I was getting bored with my others at home (namely the Power 90 series). I wanted a challenge, and I got it! This workout is very difficult, which to me is great because I can do as much as I can but there's still plenty of room for me to improve.  I like not being able to do a dvd workout perfectly as soon as I get it. I haven't sweat this much since my 2 hour soccer practice in high school 6 years ago! If you want your butt kicked, buy this dvd.",1295222400,2,478,3.8282828282828283
8353104,5,B0026MBEG4,"I love all things Amy Bento and this workout doesn't disappoint.  Even the warmup is tough and gets my heart rate up!  Amy has a great flair for putting together tough workouts that aren't hard on the joints. This is unlike other advanced instructors like Cathe Friedrich, for whom high intensity means high impact.

Amy is having a blast in this workout; her enthusiasm is catching.  I smile just watching her.

I love complex choreography and have no patience for workouts where the moves are broken down and reviewed over and over.  I like to use my brain when I workout and trying to get the moves down keeps me engaged.  Amy will do a move a few times, then put it into the routine and do the routine a few times.  By the end of the routine, I get the move.

Amy explains what she'll be doing before she does it.  Since I'm not completely familiar with her terminology, this isn't as helpful to me.  But, it doesn't matter since I just keep alternating my right and left foot and eventually it all comes together.  The flying knee, back kick, front kick is especially challenging, but really fun once you get it.

The core refining section at the end is fun and filled with some unique moves.

I highly recommend this DVD for anyone wanting a challenging kickboxing workout.",1278115200,2,1279,4.504347826086956
8353105,5,B0026MBEG4,"This is a an awesome, intense, advanced kickboxing workout.
Amy's combos are great and well thought out, the music is awesome, and Amy's energy is incredible.
The moves are advanced but not too hard to follow.  Even the most advanced exerciser is sure to be drenched in sweat by the end of this workout!
One complaint is that the music isn't loud enough.  But that is pretty minor, I just crank up the volume on my tv.",1266364800,,418,4.415584415584416
8353106,5,B0026MBEG4,"I have been addicted to taebo-style workouts for many years, most recently Billy Blanks's 'Taebo II get Ripped', alternating these workouts with running, weights, etc.  Amy Bento's CIA 2901 is so refreshing. Her routine is more choreographed, but it is broken down into parts, repeated, adding more moves each time. It has a great mix of upper and lower body, cardio and strength. The sets are even on both sides of the body - she can count! It is challenging with the choreographed sets, but each time I do it, it flows a little better, and so, a better sweat. She is not a show-off, just very good at what she does. I still feel the impact later in the day. Great!!!",1263686400,,668,4.475409836065574
8353107,5,B0026MBEG4,"Amy Bento's Kickboxing Surge is one of the funnest DVD's I've come across. I lost 1 pound in 51 minutes of doing her moves and probably would have lost more if I had did the Ab/core and warm-up. This DVD is no joke. It is truly advanced but even beginners can have fun with it. I also love Amy Bento's high-energetic, but yet goofy style of instructing. The music is not bad either. I thought Cathe Friedricks ""Kick, Punch, and Crunch"" had me sweating. But Amy Bento's Kickboxing surge takes the cake! The only problem you might run into with Amy's Dvd is that her moves go fast. So beginners may need to practice first and go over her moves in the beginning. But once you get the moves down, you will love this DVD. It's just so fun, you will do it often!",1259798400,,756,4.256944444444445
8353108,5,B0026MBEG4,"OMG!  This DVD makes Cathe kickbox look like mere child's play.  Get ready to sweat!  The ab routine is very different than what I was used to doing, but effective all the same.  The kickbox workout is very intense.  The moves could take a few tries to get down pat.  Once you learn the routine it is so much fun!  Be prepared to modify if needed as this is hard core, pardon the pun. Music is very motivational and Amy seems to be having so much fun.  You'll like this one if kickboxing is your passion!",1258416000,,504,4.177083333333333
8353109,5,B0026MBEG4,"I have many Amy Bento's dvd's but this is by far my favorite. The music is awesome, the combos are fairly easy to pick up. There are five combo's with 5 surges. Each combo is taught add on style and the moves are not complicated. The surges add to the intensity of each combo. In my opinion this is a more of hi/lo mixed with kickbox. There are also several premix options to choose from. I have not done the core section yet, but it looks challenging. Amy personality shines in this dvd.",1256169600,,488,4.258064516129032
