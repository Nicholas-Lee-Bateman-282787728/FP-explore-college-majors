8089628,5,B000BNX58K,This is the powerful true story of Eddie Perry an brilliant mind with a future until a terrible tragedy happen and let to more questions than answers. Eddie Perry was shot and killed by a white police officer bc Eddie beat up on him. Why would this man go beat up on a police officer well this is where the with out motive comes in bc there was a motive. Eddie suffered from what is called racial paranoid. I will explain Eddie was in a program where black intelligent kids got to Goto a program where they are picked for elite education at exter one of top educational schools in the country. This is where Eddie comes he is one of 4 blacks who Goto this school and it's not the way it's seems . Racism is not in his face like you would think this was the 1960s where they are being called a n word. The school Eddie goes to use sarcasm in place of racism. It's question of whether Eddie can take it or not.  There are many moments in the film where Eddie thought issues where racist but it was really in his head like when he was defending his friend Sean from a group of bullies and the security guard made a comment and the ghetto saying acting like your in the ghetto .Eddie took it as racist and he never said anything about his skin color he was talking about his attitude. So Eddie in his head believed everything is race when it's more about attitudes and behavior. This is most powerful film about how a brilliant mind can be mislead in thinking he can handle the environment he really wasn't fit for. This should be shown in every school bc education is very important but rage is not the way to handle a situation that not everything is always race but more complex .,1474761600,,1679,4.230529595015576

8089630,5,B000BNX58K,"I grew up in NYC around the time of Edmund Perry's murder and remember well the media attention and controversy associated with the experience.  Parents all over NYC were terrified that their children might be executed by NYPD for no reason.  However, if we're to be honest, by all accounts Edmund Perry appeared to be a little too smart for his own good.  It's a sad commentary on the plight of so many talented, but troubled young Black men in America.",1265760000,,454,4.580246913580247
8089631,3,B000BNX58K,"I bought this movie because I collect everything featuring Carla Gugino. The movie is depressing because a young man who had everything going for him threw it all away due to perceived racial prejudice. It is sad because it really happened - to Edmund Perry, in 1985.",1183420800,3,267,4.702127659574468
