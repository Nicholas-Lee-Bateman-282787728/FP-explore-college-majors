8633222,2,B000ZLO0NC,"I purchased this DVD because I served at Camp Enari, Pleiku, Vietnam from 1968-1969.  I was anxious to see images of people that I might remember.  The film spent almost 15 minutes on a Bob Hope Show from 1967 and an equal amount of time looking at sites from Dragon Mountain (the communicatons generators and the guy repairing them).  There was so much more that went on at Camp Enari.  I was totally disappointed in the DVD and wish now that I hadn't purchased it.  Sorry to have to be negative.  I am proud of my service and proud of the 4th Division.  I feel this DVD fell short of the mark.",1357084800,8,595,4.258928571428571
