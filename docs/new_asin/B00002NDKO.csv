1255766,5,B00002NDKO,"I fell in love with this movie. The main characters have such depth that when this story finally comes to an end, you feel compelled to read the book just to gather a particle more. I ordered the VHS and the book. The romantic tension between the Mossie and Beth always seems to linger; but is kept just out of reach and as a horse being kept moving by the proverbial carrot one can not help but to keep watching and hoping that the two will get together. Beth's relationship with her step children is cast in such a growing and loving light that it is poetry in motion to watch. I give this movie the hightest rating and I hope that you will watch it while fully awake, as it takes a bit of concentration to get into...but the rewards are well worth it.
Just the beautiful Dingle, Irish scenery alone is reason enough to watch. It is a glorious movie!",1019692800,12,852,4.265432098765432
1255767,5,B00002NDKO,"The film is an investment in time and in the characters here.  And what characters - all richly drawn!  Elizabeth - strong yet vulnerable and so very unhappy. But determined to make her life work as best she can given the limitations of life for women (not to mention unwed pregnant girls)in 1930's Ireland.  Mossie Sheehan, played so heartbreakingly beautifully by Liam Cunningham, will make you want to weep.  He falls for Elizabeth immediately, but cannot act on it.  Her parents have married her to his estranged cousin Neely (they feud over land) an older widower far from a good and loving husband or father.  Her step children - particularly Katie who is doomed to repeat Elizabeth's mistakes - who come to love and respect her as their mother.  Elizabeth longs to experience the things all 25 year old women want.  Fun, flirting, passion.  And she gets it with Daniel McCarthy a boy Katie's age who tragically decides that he is in love with Elizabeth.  Mayhem and death ensue.  When Mossie finally declares his true feelings to Elizabeth you just want to cry.  He's so beautifully sweet!  Yes, make the investment.  It is a sometimes dark, sometimes unpleasant, but honest look at rural life.  But there is a definite pay-off in the end.  My only complaint is with the last line in the film.  Too corny by half!",1019606400,61,1320,4.719298245614035
1255768,5,B00002NDKO,"This the first time I have ever given a movie 5 stars. This one truly mezmorized me. It is dark and forebodding, yet it has its moments and the ending is somewhat surprising. I had never heard of any of the actors and they all gave compelling performances. The cinematography is excellent, Ireland must be a very beautiful country. This movie really requires you to concentrate, don't watch it if you are doing anything else.",1009497600,8,425,4.68
1255769,5,B00002NDKO,"This movie drew me in right from the beginning. I was reluctant to even watch it because I was not familiar with any of the cast. I could feel Beth's pain.......pregnant by a womanizing actor, pushed away by her parents whose only concern was what other people think and forced to marry an older man she neither knew or loved. Enduring the drudgery of a loveless marriage and stepchildern who loathed her, feeling like an old woman in a young girl's body.  Mossie sheehan who loves her from the moment he sees her, helpless to do anything about it. His is in a continuous fued with her husband who is living in the house and on the land that rightly belongs to Mossie. This movie gives hope that even the darkest circumstances can turn around and it really is possible to find your soul mate and one true love. I watch this movie often. It is one of my favorites right along with Pride and Prejudice. It also made me a die hard fan of Liam Cunningham.",996969600,36,951,4.372881355932203
1255770,5,B00002NDKO,"Have you ever wondered what life would have been like if a certain event had never occured?
If the bus had never broken down Elizabeth(Beth) would never have met George and her life wouldn't have been changed for the worse.  It is the 1930's and Beth is living in Cork with her parents. She is after arriving home from a trip to Dublin with her friend Ida, but she has a deep secret that no one must know - she is pregnant and has only two choices- leave home and move into a home run by the nuns for unwed mothers or to marry.  After a horrifying visit to the nun-run home Beth solomly decides to marry. The match is made for her, she is to marry a recently bereaved man named Neeley Scollard. After a quiet ceremony, Beth is brought home- not to Cork but to her new home in Beara, on the west most tip of Dingle where she is met by her new daughters. Beth has a son whom she calls Francey. Straight away it is obvious that Neeley ia strict man- all of his family fear him. Neeley's cousin Mossie (Liam Cunningham) is a decent type of person but Neeley maintains that Mossie is a land-grabber and that he and his family are to have nothing to do with him. After a dance, Neeley losses his temper and hurts Francey. That night, while Beth is in Cork with Francey, there is a death in Beara and the main suspect is a young man called Danny Mc Carthy. Beth can't decide whether she wants to stay in Beara or move back home to Cork with her family. Mossie trys to win her heart but....... You don't think that I'm going to tell you the whole story? If I did, where's the point in watching this story.
The movie is based on the best selling novel by Deirdre Purcell. It manages to pull you into the story and into the lives of each of the characters. I really enjoyed this movie - I have seen it so many times that I almost know it off by heart. I hope that if you chose to watch it, you will enjoy this movie. Go neiri an bothar leat.

1255771,4,B00002NDKO,"I must warn you that the picture on the video box is very misleading.  This is the very young man, 6 years younger than the heroine, who becomes infatuated with her, the woman also shown on the box.  This young man,  however, is not the hero of this video series.  The hero is a man who is in  conflict with her brutal drunk of a husband, over a piece of land that  should have come to the hero by inheritance, but went to the drunk instead.  This man, Mossie, is also very attractive so why his image wasn't used on  the video box is unknown.

The heroine is forced into marriage with this  much-older brute by her family, since she is about to become an unwed  mother by a long-gone actor in 1937 Ireland. She lived in the city with her  prosperous family but moves to her husband's village, where everyone barely  ekes out a living on the rocky land by the sea. She also must raise the  many children her husband had with his late wife.  Some viewers may be put  off by two violent scenes between the drunken husband and wife.  The first  is a rape scene, which is rough going.  In the second, her son is hurt  which cuts off the violence between them.  If you can handle the rape scene  though, the rest of the series is very enjoyable, well done, and happily  resolved and should provide a good evening's entertainment.  My husband and  I both enjoyed it a lot, watching it over two nights.

1255772,5,B00002NDKO,"This adaptation of the Deirdre Purcell novel runs approximately 200 minutes and is worth every second. In the beginning of the film, Elizabeth Sullivan has her first romance with an actor in a traveling show and finds  herself pregnant and the actor long gone. Her parents, wanting to avoid  embarrassment, consult their priest for advise and he comes up with a  recently widowed older man with young children who needs a wife. Left with  few options, Elizabeth, played beautifully by newcomer Elisabeth  Dermot-Walsh, marries this stranger and endures a life much harder than the  privileged one she left. Her husband, Neeley, treats her like property he's  paranoid of losing, but not especially cherished property.
Watching from  the hill above is Neeley's cousin, Mossie Sheenan (Liam Cunningham). Neeley  inherited his farm from Mossie's father, who died when Mossie was very  young and probably before he could change his will to leave the place to  his son - a situation that has caused bad blood between them. This has  Elizabeth misinterpreting just about everything Mossie does as being  motivated by a desire to either cause Neeley trouble or to regain his  land.
There isn't much more we can tell without giving away too much, but  this movie has everything you can hope for . . .a great story, beautiful  scenery, haunting music, and WONDERFUL ACTING.",942624000,120,1364,5.04932735426009

1255775,1,B00002NDKO,"This movie would have been intriguing and enjoyable, I'm sure, if there were closed captions or English subtitles. The accents of the actors are totally indecipherable to my native Southern American ear. Apparently, Falling for a Dancer is well respected and highly reviewed by many who have posted reviews here. However, I was very disappointed that I could understand hardly a single word spoken. Although, as I said, my background is native American Southern (born and reared in South Carolina), I have travelled widely in the U.S. and to several countries in Europe, and have lived in various locations in the north, midwest and west of the U.S.A. I have friends from Germany, France, Ireland, England, Australia, Italy, etc. and have no problem understanding various accents and variations of spoken English. This film was a total loss to me. Fortunately I found it at my local public library, thus there was no financial cost to watch it. I'm sure I would enjoy it if I knew what the actors are saying. If anyone knows of a DVD that does include captions or English subtitles, I would be grateful for a comment here to tell me where to find it. Thank you.",1466467200,,1161,4.781094527363184

Gentle and lovely in parts, exciting and stimulating in others this movie does a wonderful job of depicting life in rural Ireland - both the small town kindnesses and social mores are examined here with an unblemished eye - giving the viewer insight into what life must have been like in this period.

1255804,5,B00002NDKO,"I decided to finally buy this DVD for myself - it is truly an indulgence to be able to watch it as many times as I like to!!  This love story set in Ireland in 1937 is so beautiful and poignant. Liam Cunningham as Mossie Sheehan shines in probably one of the most compelling and touching performances I've seen by an actor as a man in the throes of unrequited love.  His understated acting was so powerful with its underlying smoldering sensuality - I fell in love with him myself.  Elisabeth Dermot-Walsh as the unhappy Beth was just outstanding - her passion and love of life cut short by a mistake that had dire consequences and equally dire solutions in 1937 Ireland where women's rights were practically unheard of.  The acting of the entire cast of this movie - the children, the townspeople, her parents, was just so outstanding.  Put this story with its fine cast of actors into the most beautiful country ever seen (I had the privilege of visiting both No. Ireland and the Rep. of Ireland just recently) and you have a treasured classic to be enjoyed just for the sheer pleasure of falling in love again every time you watch it.  My only negative about this movie was it ended too quickly - when Mossie finally revealed his feelings to Beth - I think that deserved a very passionate kiss, which we didn't see - but hopefully happened !!!",1329177600,9,1346,4.518518518518518
1255805,4,B00002NDKO,"In spite of, to me, a rather slow start that certainly sets the ""mood"" for this film of ""Falling for a Dancer"", the film is really a very engrossing ""love story"" that kept me highly entertained.  The film is very dark being filmed beautifully on the coast of Ireland in a bleak area where it seems to rain all of the time.  The heroine, Beth (acted wonderfully by Elizabeth Dermot-Walsh) has become pregnant by a touring actor much to the horror (it is 1937) of her parents especially her ""tight-lipped"" and no doubt frigid mother.  Although her father's objects (had to please her mom) she is married off to a much older widower with (I believe) five (5) kids that includes ""a babe in arms"".  The widower (played greatly by Richard Standeven) is not too nice to her,once they are to themselves on the coast of Ireland--he's very possessive of Beth and not very loving.  She seeks attention at a dance from a very young man which makes her widower husband completely furious.  Lurking on the hill outside of their home is her husband's sexy male cousin that works for him--they don't care for each other very much.  Although Beth has many obstacles and nightmarish occurrences to deal with, she proves to be a very strong and courageous woman indeed finding true love eventually.

This film could have dissolved into a weepy soap-opera; however it does NOT become weepy at all because it is so well written, directed and acted.  So, If you desire a really good and believable romantic movie, get this film.",1318377600,4,1506,4.674242424242424
1255806,5,B00002NDKO,"This movie was very enjoyable. It is the story of a young, 19 y/o girl who becomes pregnant by a handsome actor at a time when that kind of behavior is not acceptable. Pressured into marrying a 40 y/o widower (he looks MUCH older) by her prim and proper parents she feels trapped in a loveless existence. A young Colin Farrell plays a 19 y/o who is accused of killing a man. My major gripe was that there are no sub titles. The Irish accent was difficult to understand at times. Acting is superb by all the major player.",1315180800,5,520,4.262626262626263
1255807,4,B00002NDKO,"Wonderful period drama/romance. It reminded me of Far From the Madding Crowd mixed with a dash of Pride & Prejudice - all set in rural early 20th Century Ireland.  Mossie Sheehan is every inch the devoted Gabriel Oak; and when he hunts down and returns the silly step-daughter who has run off with a lover, it's reminiscent of Darcy's search and delivery of Lydia.  That said, it isn't a five-star series.  The wigs are horrific.  Elizabeth settles a little too easily and quickly into the role of mother (particularly to another woman's children) and adjusts a little too happily into rural life for a woman who was raised in the city as solicitor's daughter.  But all faults are forgiven on my part when Mossie Sheehan declares his love - twice (sort of).  My knees buckled and I had to get a drink of water to recover my senses.  All in all, the most romantic series I've seen in a long while (not counting Gaskell's incomparable North & South).  You won't be disappointed.",1284336000,2,976,4.633720930232558

Years ago, that was not the case.

1255821,4,B00002NDKO,"This is a heartbreaking epic tale about the difficult road a young woman must travel when she breaks the rules of social acceptance.  It's hard for a modern young woman like myself to fathom that a mere seventy years ago, this was the fate of an unwed mother. Elizabeth's life is turned upside down when she becomes pregnant, and has no idea where the father has gone.  Social restrictions leave Elizabeth with two unappealing choices: Admittance into a Magdalene convent or marriage to a farmer twice her age whom she has never met.  She chooses the latter and is determined to make the best of it, but the harsh, cold, and desolate landscape of her new home is a metaphor for the fate of her marriage.  Her husband Neely, is very possesive and treats her like a piece of property. He is particularly leary of his Cousin/ Neighbor, Mossie,  who he calls a ""Land Grabber"".  They have been fueding for years over the ownership of family property which also gives way to Neely's fearful possesiveness over Elizabeth.  Elizabeth Dermot Walsh gives a fantastic performance as the fictional Elizabeth, who has been so severely beat down yet stays incredibly strong throughout all the tragic twists and turns of her life.  The most impressive scene is towards the end when Elizabeth kneels at the grave of her stepdaughter and blames herself for her death. That point is the culmination of so many emotions. It shows how Elizabeth has given all she can to rectify herself for all the wrong-doing she feels responsibility toward, but at this point feels she has failed.  The acting is very powerfull in this scene.

I am giving four stars only because I felt that the ending was a bit abrupt. It is sad right up until the end, then there is an admition of love and bam -- a wedding and happy ending.  I feel like if you are going to make a movie four hours long there is no reason for an abrupt ending.

This is a fantastic movie for anyone with an interest in women's studies, social influences, period films, or you just want to see a good old fashioned tale of a person rising above so many adversities.  If you like this movie, a good supplement would be ""The Magdalene Sisters"". It will show you what would have been in store for Elizabeth had she admitted herself into the Magdalene Convent. It is not for the faint of heart though, as it is much more brutal and depressing. It will make you angry, but will give valuable insight into the bleak choices that faced Elizabeth in Falling for a Dancer.",1160956800,7,2497,4.571748878923767

1255823,2,B00002NDKO,"I bought this movie based on all the glowing five-star reviews (and based on the fact that I am desperate for more great period pieces).  Well, this is not a great period piece.  It is better than Berkeley Square, for instance, but is nothing near the level of Pride and Prejudice or Wives and Daughters.  The acting is good, the scenery is wonderful, but the script is only average (and sometimes poor).  The story is bleak with no real pay-off, like Dickens without the humor or the subtlety.  There is nothing more annoying than unrealistic or manufactured tragedy (think Jude the Obscure), and this story is in that line.  If you can find the DVD on sale, it might be worth wasting a rainy night with, but I doubt it is one you will want to watch over and over.",1119657600,18,765,4.428571428571429
1255824,3,B00002NDKO,"First of all, I want to say that this movie was shot on the Beara peninsula in southwestern Ireland, not anywhere near Dingle, which is miles and miles away.  How do I know that?  I know it because Beara is my mother's birthplace and I have spent many months living there during my life.  In fact, the ""farm"" location of this picture is only about a quarter mile from my own.  The village (with all the modern elements painted out) is our village of Eyeries.  The graveyard by the sea is the old cemetery of Kilcatherine.
That said I found this movie to be a very run-of-the-mill romantic melodrama in, what must be for most viewers, an exoctic locale.  Some of the acting was good, some was dreadful.  The best job was done by Liam Cunningham in the role of Mossie Sheehan.  I found his portrayal of the silently yearning and misunderstood neighbor to be quite wonderful.  And, he captured the rather difficult Beara accent beautifully.  Most of the other actors are adequate, though no more.  I found the heroine, played by Elizabeth Dermot-Walsh, to be barely believable in her role.  Some of the plot is so inconsistent as to really puzzle.
And the saddest thing about this movie is the use made of some of the most glorious scenery this world has to offer.  Beara is a peninsula with a thick spine of mountain, surrounded by the ocean (Bantry Bay to the south, Kenmare Bay to the north).  Most of the movie seems to have been shot toward the mountains and in the rain.  There are very few scenes shot in good weather and only a few glimpses of the astonishing vista over the ocean (during the burial of Neillie Scholard) and the morning when Beth talks to her daughter about how beautiful the day is.  Maybe the shooting schedule took place during a rainy period, but this is a pity.",1057449600,10,1788,4.5062111801242235

1255826,4,B00002NDKO,"As you might have guessed, I rented this movie solely for the chance to see young Colin Farrell, he is in his early 20's when this Irish, made for TV 3 and 1/2 hour miniseries was made, and he plays a young lad of 19 who falls in love with a woman who because of an unexpected pregnancy is sent to marry a 40 year old widower at the age of 19. This movie has almost all aspects of both the good and bad of life, love, hate, rape, hope, murder, tragic accidents, everything. It's well worth seeing for all the performances, not just Colin Farre's, although he did do an excellent job.",1053216000,5,583,4.168141592920354
1255827,5,B00002NDKO,"This film was heartbreaking and hopeful at the same time. The heroine Elizabeth is as beautiful an actress as they come. Mossie who has always loved her since the day he saw her on her wedding day to Neely, a much older  abusive man she doesn't love but marries rather than give her unborn child by an actor up for adoption. She is faced with his children whom she has grown to love as her own.  At a dance her sexually is aroused by the handsome young Danny played by the dashing Dubliner Colin Farrell. Tragedy follows because of this flirtation and when the handsome Danny asked her to run off with him to America she says no. This is the only part of the movie for a moment I stared at in disbelief. If someone as handsome as Colin Farrell asked you to run off with him, honey this Grandma would set the record for packing. I realized the one man who has always loved her Mossie will find his voice and tell her. Liam Cunningham is terrific as Mossie and does a beautiful job with at what seems as unrequited love. for Elizabeth. I purchased this DVD because of Colin Farrell but this delectable chocolate of a movie had a wondeful surprise inside. It is a really a great film.

Many struggles and triumphs. I adore Liam Cunningham (as Mossie Sheehan), you will too. Be warned..they seem to be cashing in on Colin Farrell, but his character in this movie is one of many, and relatively brief.",1468454400,4,363,4.515151515151516
