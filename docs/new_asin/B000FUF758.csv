2588671,3,B000FUF758,"...well I had never heard of this movie before, and I saw it here on amazon by accident.  I read about it and decided what the heck, another addition to my zombie library.  Well here it goes: it is about a guy that fills a truckfull of milk with some sort of chemical, in efforts to make the townspeople sick.  The women that drink it die.  Then theres this guy that gets paid to dispose of toxic waste, and the place he picks as the dumpster is a cemetary.  Well at some point the women start to come back to life and wreak havok on some of the people working for that corporation.  The story is pretty weird and you will be questioning yourself at times.  There are not that many killings, but there are some pretty disturbing images.  Them most disturbing is of the zombie girls pretty much raping a woman, and then sticking a sword through her crotch, that looked pretty darn disturbing.  If you like nudity and shock value, this movie has a little bit of both, but not enough to justify a purchase for that alone.  If I had not watched the alternate ending I would have enjoyed it a lot better.  The alternate ending is not shocking at all, it just completely ruins the movie in my opinion.  If you are like me and just want to expand your zombie collection then get it, the price is right, but don't expect very much from this one.",1161216000,19,1337,4.282868525896414

 Don't watch this one.  I have seen over a hundred Zombie flicks and I didn't think I could be grossed out but boy was I wrong.  In one scene three Zombies kidnap a whore, drive her to her house and begin to kill her.  They stop in mid murder and strip which is pretty weird.  The heads of the Zombies are hideous, dead monster hideous, but when they disrobe their bodies are those of the young girls who died only a few days before.  They engage in a lesbian Zombie rape (a first, I'll give you that) of the doomed woman and then murder her by sticking a sword into to her most precious place.  And since this is a French film, everything is shown up close and personal.  No half measures here.  This is immediately followed by what seems to be a mutant baby birth by from a naked pregnant woman in the shower.  They hit all the bases.
 If you are still with me, aside from that terrible stuff, the movie is merely bad by Zombie movie standards.  The acting is pretty much OK, ditto for general production values and direction.  They dubbed in the dialog from French to English which always presents a problem in terms of fidelity to the original story.  As it happens, the story-as one of the actors say in the course of the film-the 'story is incoherent'.  A German milk company in France has a corrupt French manager.  The milk gets contaminated by an eco-terrorist and kills three young milk drinking girls.  The crooked manager hires a stupid head to dispose of toxic waste (toxic waste from a milk plant?).  The stupid head dumps the stuff at the local grave yard where it seeps into the graves of the three dead girls.  The rise from the grave and they are wickedly pissed off.
 The Zombies have excellent make up from the chin up but from the chin down they are merely young girls.  It is startling to see the Zombie heads on the lovely young bodies when they take off their burial robes to gang rape a prostitute.
 A grand stupidity in the story line has another crook escaping with $3,000,000 US in swag when she stops and lets three Zombies get in the car with her.  Come on!
 There are many mild (by French standards) romantic episodes among most of the characters at one time or another.  Full frontal nudity of the women is standard.  Ordinarily, having a few naked girls in a Zombie flick we like.  But we also like a story that makes some sense.  The Zombie girls do not devour people so much a murder them.  One guy, the stupid head waste dumper, is devoured but only one part of him is chewed off-I don't have to say which part.
 This is not rated but should be rated R from nudity and terrible, over the top sexual violence.  It lasts exactly one and a half hours, spot on Zombie film time.
 Please do not watch this rare zero brain film, it will only encourage them to make another one.",1419984000,,2848,4.343453510436433
8126631,3,B000FUF758,"This French exploitation film is memorable for many reasons. It has some graphic sexual type gore, as well as full frontal nudity with good looking women. The locations are nice, and it has some good atmospheric scenes. It's decently directed with effective soundtracks, and it moves at a decent pace. It also has a climax with a ridiculous and awful, yet somewhat memorable, twist. The problem is this DVD is cut. I've got this on VHS in its original erotic version. The quality on my tape is pretty bad, but it contains all the nudity and the original absurd ending. The quality on this DVD is good, but it's missing some of the sex and nudity. The DVD also has the original ending cut out, but this scene is still available as an extra feature on the disc. I've got the pressed disc, but Amazon now lists this as being a DVD-R. This film is at that Movie-Censorship site. That'll show you what's cut out. I would've given it a higher rating if it was complete.",1386374400,,963,4.4772727272727275
8126632,4,B000FUF758,"REVENGE OF THE LIVING DEAD GIRLS opens w/ a milk-truck-driver who picks up a hot hitchhiker. He's so preoccupied w/ her that he fails to notice the man pouring some red liquid into the top of his tanker! The scene switches to a young bride-to-be who suddenly drops dead, a bottle of milk nearby! Next, the man who poisoned the milk supply is in a bar, when two milk-drinking, female patrons fall dead at his feet! Of course, it's all a big corporate cover-up, resulting in the dumping of chemical waste in a cemetery. Oops! You guessed it, the chemicals are dumped in the very cemetery where the dead milk-drinkers are buried! Now, they're rising from their graves, and man are they ticked off! The girls go on a vengeful, murderous rampage, killing those deemed responsible for their condition. While this isn't the best zombie movie, it does feature some disturbing scenes of undead violence perpetrated on the living! Well worth a watch or two...",1372896000,,949,4.757575757575758
8126633,3,B000FUF758,"This movie was interesting, to say the least. Of course, the graphics aren't exactly great, but it is from the 80s and low budget-- you can't knock off stars for that. The storyline is a bit hard to follow at times, as it seems to jump all over the place, although towards the end of the movie it makes sense.

The movie is pretty funny, simply because it is so cheesy, however, some scenes are disturbing, such as jamming a shoe heel into someone's face, or mutilating sexual organs (both genders). There is also quite a bit of nudity and sex portrayed.",1362528000,,554,4.431372549019608
8126634,5,B000FUF758,"I stumbled across this film on Amazon Prime for free and I thought I'd check it out. By looking at the cover you know it's not going to be a visual treat but what it lacks in effects and budget, it makes it up in absurdity! This is the only zombie film I can recall where the zombies think! They make tactical moves, stalk their prey and attack with precision. They don't bite or scratch but they pull hair and clothes. I'll not let anymore cats outta the bag but if you are a prime member, check it out. If not, those who enjoy bad horror films, jump on this. If you're not into bad and absurd, stay away.",1356912000,2,606,4.100840336134453
8126635,3,B000FUF758,"It's very hard to try to Review this Film

If you take it for what it is
It's a Rare Odd Hybrid of Zombie,Adult Film, and the Grindhouse Genre!
For a Film from 1987 It has a timeless look!
the cinematography (Mostly outside Shots are very good The cemetery scenes are Standout Scenes!
The Score is Haunting
All the F/X Effects are practical and  look slick and polished
Besides the Lame/ ""Fake"" looking Zombie masks on the 3 woman
If this Film was Re-made today it wouldn't work using CGI  IMO

The Story is Strange  (Has a environmental Plot line that is ahead of it's time) Why does it seem like only Horror/B Films go deep into Social Issue is Beyond me?
3 Females who work for the Local Chemical Plant die from drinking milk. The story gets very Crazy involving Black mail, sex tapes, dumping Hazardous waste into a Graveyard (Which brings the recently Dead girls back from the dead)
You guessed it the Dead Girls are out for Blood & Revenge
The gore like i said before looks good
The scene where the 3 Dead Girls snatch up the Blonde Prostitute is Crazy and how they kill her off may be a Old F/X Gag but, it looks real and will make any man or woman squirm!
The ending is a  WTF Ending  (You have to watch the Alternate Shocking Ending) Why this ending wasn't used is Beyond me??
The Alt. ending in many ways Changes the film But, at the same time it makes alot more sense of the 80min. you just spent on the story.
For those who watched 2008's Zombie Stripers This Film Is so much better just for the Shock Value alone!

The DVD is a B+ The PQ could be much better Retromedia didn't put any time in the 1st UNCUT U.S. Release of this on the DVD Format
some scenes look worn with a line down the middle
It's very watchable But, the Studio Could have Re-Mastered it They did buy the rights to it! Why not go all out on the dvd
The Audio is Good 2.0  But, that to should have been given a 5.1 Dolby Digital Track
The Horror Genre has a Huge Die hard fan base!
This Film might not be the Best But, it Deserves more of a Special Edition
Any die hard Zombie, Euro Horror, or Grindhouse Fan This Film is A Must See
Take it for what you want I'll keep it in my dvd Collection and watch it again  7/10",1272672000,,2199,4.140845070422535
8126636,2,B000FUF758,"I saw this movie in the used section of a local DVD store in the mall, and the title alone got me interested. I'm a big horror fan, yet I had never heard of this film. The back of the DVD made it sound like this was one of the most shocking, most disturbing things ever made. Of course, being a sucker for films like that, I bought it, for around 7 bucks. After viewing, I gotta say that I was AND wasn't surprised by it. First off, I wasn't excepting something great here, and the true is, it isn't. Its ok at best. But again, I've seen worse. The overall story wasn't bad, but the execution was weak, especially the ending. You have to watch the alternate ending just to understand what happened. Of course, the acting was weak, and the special effects were actually pretty decent, except for the actual zombie girl's masks, which were poor quality, especially when shown close-up. But again, these are all things that come to be expected with films like these. What did surprise me, however, is the lack of shock value the film had compared to its reputation. Yes, there are a couple of perhaps overly graphic scenes, but apart from that, there's nothing that special about it, even though I can understand why just those few scenes alone would cause controversy. I've read reviews that complain about too much nudity and such, and yes, I do feel that in some instances, there was nudity just for the sake of nudity, and nothing more. But I don't think that this is some zombie porn flick. Even though honestly, that's what I was expecting. As with a lot of films like these, the film's reputation far outweighs the actual movie itself. And that to me, was my biggest disappointment. When you have things that say ""Shocking Beyond Belief"" on the front cover, and a big red warning label on the back on the DVD, then expectations become a bit higher than normal. And for me, there wasn't no where near the level of blood, gore, violence, and yes, even nudity or sex..to match those claims. This one is worth watching (especially for a few specific scenes that have been mentioned in other reviews), and perhaps worth owning at a cheap price. But don't expect too much beyond that.",1248220800,,2182,4.526582278481013
8126637,3,B000FUF758,"The price is right on this one.  It's a french zombie flick , frances first gore flick from 1986.  The violence involving genital mutilation
both a male  and a females units,  kept this from hitting the grind house circuit back then. This made the movie controversial in it's day.  In 2004 or so another even cheaper american zombie flick that went straight to dvd had a similiar scene.  Revenge is a  very low budget flick  but it's not all that bad as they go.  After all if  you don't expect alot of these low budget horror movies then you won't be dissapointed.  The alternative ending changes the whole idea of the movie.  but without that ending it's still a zombie flick if you want it to be. And the cool 1980's music is always a plus.  This movie is not for young kids though and should be seen by adults only.",1221523200,,819,4.344370860927152
8126638,3,B000FUF758,"Firstly, if you derive no other sustenance from this review, understand that tainted milk, when mixed with foul-mouthed young women, equals a horrifying return from the grave!

A corporate saboteur arranges to have the contents of a milk tanker tainted with some unknown but presumably ill-intended substance. Shortly thereafter, three young women ingest said milk and almost simultaneously drop dead. A little later, the women rise from their graves. Though they've apparently been buried for a short time, their faces are horribly skeletonized even while their half naked bodies are, aside from patches of ashen discoloration, completely normal. And now the horror of the living dead is realized, as the Living Dead Girls return to town to claim their horrific revenge.

Can your heart stand the fright? The course of revenge is a meandering one. The Living Dead Girls stalk and murder a group of people maybe more or less vaguely and halfheartedly involved in the causation of their terrible demise.

At one point, the she-corpses infiltrate the house of a corporate chief in order to kill the man's wife. The Living Dead Girls seize the wife, incapacitate and kill her, and then her secret boyfriend enters the house with intention of romancing his mistress. WARNING: The following is an actual excerpt of the boyfriend's dialogue: ""Our wedding night. Don't be afraid, my love. The first time is delicate, but I promise you many, many, many nights of happiness. Don't say anything; don't move; you must feel my expert caresses on your body and the white dress of your virginity will be the witness of our love."" During another revenge killing, the Living Dead Girls use the expert caresses of a broadsword in order to be the witness to a local scheming prostitute's love. Another victim is drowned in an indoor swimming pool (Living Dead Girls DO in fact float). Yet another murder victim is attacked and killed within a confessional booth.

Eventually the murders are brought to light and rumors begin to circulate of the supernatural nature of the murderers. The town rallies together and prepares to douse the Living Dead Girls with fuel and burn them alive. Perhaps sensing this, the Living Dead Girls catch a ride in a speeding automobile, although the automobile unfortunately crashes within vicinity of the town mob and the Living Dead Girls are subsequently burned alive. Unsatisfied with that ending? If so, trying the alternate ending listed in the DVD's bonus material.

Final Analysis: Yes, this movie does suck. However, it's just horrible enough to present a certain level of amusement. And besides, it might make a good survival guide should horrific events as these ever occur in your hometown.",1186876800,4,2714,5.062639821029083
8126639,3,B000FUF758,"Well, the only thing i can say about this film is that its an odd duck. However, it was a very good idea for the movie, but, it just truly fell apart as soon as it began. Bad directing, bad acting, bad story and plot and making the whole movie look like a rush job, is what truly ruins the film, but, like all cheese horror it is a plus to many fans out there. The Alternate ending does not ruin the film, in all honest, you have to watch the alternate ending in order to ""understand"" the whole movie. However, just a note before you buy, this movie has the title ""Zombie"" in it, doesn't really make the movie a ""zombie movie"", in other words, it is but it isn't. I give this movie 3 1/2 stars for at least trying and you should rent it before you buy it.",1164758400,,755,4.006622516556291
