2196614,5,B0006VXMJ4,"My son likes to play with Weebles, so I bought him this DVD. He loves it and I sorta like it too (I'm not a big fan of kid's TV). I LOVE that I can put it on and he will sit quietly through it while I do house work, home accounting, or catching up on my email.",1127174400,2,260,3.5
2196615,5,B0006VXMJ4,"My girls, 2 and 4, really like this one and ask to watch it often.  They find the music fun, upbeat, and catchy, and the computer animation is great.  Probably not destined to be a classic, but I'm glad we ordered this one.",1126656000,4,223,4.162790697674419

8043661,5,B0006VXMJ4,Cute dvd - welcome addition to my children's collection.  Four entertaining shows with catchy songs that keeps their attention.  Would love to add more Weebles to the collection.,1325548800,,178,5.321428571428571
8043662,5,B0006VXMJ4,"We found the toys at a second hand store, and when my daughter saw the movie on the rack, she had to have it. She is barely 3yo and she watches this movie as often as I'll let her. It teaches about friendship and teamwork and sharing. It also teaches that everyone has faults and it's important to love people as they are.",1184284800,,322,4.126984126984127
8043663,1,B0006VXMJ4,"I was extremely disappointed in this DVD. I wish I had previewed it before letting my 3yr old watch this. Although they make an attempt at teaching some lessons they leave quite a few out and show that bad behavior is permissible. The Susie Q character is reckless and inconsiderate of others yet she rarely gets admonished for her behavior. Not to mention the spaghetti slurping. We can no longer eat spaghetti as my dd always tries to slurp it like she saw on the video. Pass this one up. There are plenty of better ones out there like Sesame Street, Big Bear in the Blue House, Wiggles, anything from PBS.",1159142400,6,608,4.486486486486487
8043664,1,B0006VXMJ4,"I bought these becasue my [...] loved the previews for them (which we saw on little bear dvd's)where the weebles are hopping (if weebles can do that) and dancing around.  I have yet to see that segment in the dvd's and I really don't want to watch either of these a second time.  I know they are not meant for me to watch, but they are pretty much pointless and mind numbing and my kids will not be watching them.  Do not waste your money.  Stick to the Wiggles and Little Bear.",1153958400,3,478,4.163043478260869
8043665,4,B0006VXMJ4,"My 3 year old had the Weebles figures and we though she would like this DVD.  There are several short stories which is good for holding her attention, and each one teaches a simple lesson.",1141516800,3,188,4.371428571428571
8043666,3,B0006VXMJ4,MY two girls abosutely love watching the webbles sing songs. This movie keeps their attention. I certainly recommend this one.,1140739200,,126,5.35
