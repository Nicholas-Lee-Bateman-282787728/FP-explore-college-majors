7902542,5,B000003K5V,"Great, very moving episode.  This one shakes the quiet, sensitive, reserved Beverly to the core!  The scenery of Caldos is so lovely and very typical of Northern Europe, which is fitting since Beverly is Scottish and has that northern appearance to match.  The ceremony to bury Bev's beloved grandmother is touching and it's plain to see that Beverly's mourning is deep; she still has the tears in her eyes as she utters Felisa's eulogy.

I also loved the scene where Beverly is talking to Deanna Troi about how much she misses her Nana; very sweet and very moving.

We also caught glimpses into Beverly's unconventional, somewhat wacky family; her mother died when she was little; her parents never married, so she never saw her father; she mostly grew up with her grandmother, whom she loved very much.

Storms set in when Beverly spots a handsome young man who gives her an odd feeling.  She finds herself attracted to Ronin, as he introduces himself and is nearly initiated into a dangerous, addictive ""love affair.""

Sensitive Bev is also very aroused by reading certain entries in Felisa's journal and finds out that her grandma also had an ""affair"" with this so-called ""ghost.""

It's also an odd episode since Ronin takes over Bev for a while.  It also draws out Beverly's high sensitivity since although she appears to be ""happy"" and in ""love,"" she also develops dark cirles under her eyes, her usually husky, quiet voice becomes thin, rather ragged, and strained, and her usually neat appearance becomes disheveled.

Deanna and Jean Luc are especially concerned about this change in Beverly and when she makes unexpected move of leaving the ship and deciding to stay on Caldos, Jean Luc knows that such rash, impulsive behavior is not typical of the usually cautious, level-headed Beverly.

The climax is especially good when Beverly realizes how dangerous Ronin is and her emotional pain is captured well here when she must destroy Ronin.  Love how she contacts the ship and tells Will Riker to desengage the energy force that's partially feeding Ronin, then fires at Ronin, vanishing him, then sinks down on a gravestone in tears.

One thing I love about ST:TNG is that the women are very resourceful and usually rescue themselves rather than waiting from a man to rescue them like too many other TV shows do.  It's refreshing and great to see Beverly, despite being an emotional wreck and in tears, rescuing herself from Ronin rather than one of the men do it for her.  Good resolution.

Liked the ending with Beverly talking to Deanna; she's a very articulate, intelligent woman and I liked how she was able to clearly analyze her feelings and thoughts about the whole Ronin deal and her somewhat crazy family.",1207353600,,2723,4.872017353579175
7902543,2,B000003K5V,"While many episodes of the series rarely focused on ship's physician, Dr. Beverly Crusher, this one does and, unfortunately, it's rather tame with little that is commendable. At the end of my initial viewing, I couldn't help but wonder the mindset behind this installment. Repeat viewings have not altered this puzzlement.",1040860800,3,322,5.333333333333333
7902544,1,B000003K5V,"Crusher is prepared to throw in her career for the sake of her new lover, Ronin - the family ghost who has loved the women of her family since the seventeenth century. But why isn't she telling her friends what's going on? And what is the connection with the problems with Caldos II's weather control system?
Gothic romance meets Star Trek? This might have been a good idea in theory, but it didn't come off. The writing is bad and the acting is over the top. The reasons for Crusher's strange behaviour are never really made clear. The faux Scottish setting is twee. And so what if Ronin made Crusher's female ancestors very, very happy? He was a lying creep who fed on them for centuries!
I would go so far as to call this episode unwatchable.",1028592000,2,745,4.445255474452555
7902545,5,B000003K5V,"""Sub Rosa"" did not air in 1987, but in early 1994 during the last season of TNG.  It was not directed by R. Wiemer, but by series cast regular Jonathan Frakes (Cmdr. Riker).  This episode could be better described as a gothic horror/suspense/romance. It was set on Dr. Beverly Crusher's homeworld of Caldos. One of the main characters was a mysterious energy-being/ghost who'd been a part of the 'Howard' family legacy for centuries unbeknownst to Beverly.  He'd seduced all of the Howard women and it wasn't hard to understand how, he was a real cutie!  It was quite an emotionally moving episode, eery and romantic while at the same time exciting.  It's a refreshing departure from the usual TNG approach to storytelling.",971222400,3,723,4.89344262295082
7902546,5,B000003K5V,"This episode is the only one I can recall in which a ""haunting"" like phenomenon is used in the storyline.  After attending her grandmothers funeral, Dr. Crusher begins having visits from the spirit of her late  granny's lover.
She is soon influenced to resign from Starfleet and move  into what is now her cottage and live with her new ""lover"".
It  is a perfect mixing of science fiction and intellectual horror.  Others  should learn from this",962841600,3,444,4.776315789473684
7902547,5,B000003K5V,"A wonderful episode of ST:TNG.  Better than the shoot 'em up episodes,  this one deals with matters of the heart via a good ole' ghost story.  Beverly almost succumbs to her family's phantom, only to be saved my  Jean-Luc in the nick of time.  Has some interesting angst between the  doctor and captain!",961804800,,303,4.622641509433962
