8204374,2,B000S5TAN0,"This is a rip off! It's identical to the previous Image release, ""Cartoons that Time Forgot - Volume II"" except it's on 2 discs with generic packaging. The titles are identical, the quality is similar, but the price is higher. I don't know why they bothered to do this - it appears to be two DVD-Rs with paper labels. I'd prefer the Image version and I was expecting this to be both Volumes I and II, but alas, no. Both of the previous Image discs are excellent. Go for the good ones, not this imitation.",1198540800,2,504,4.315789473684211
