While the episodes on this volume aren't fantastic, they will keep fans of the series entertained at least. Fans of Oreldo and Martis will be happy with episodes that revolve mostly around them and the two part story at the end manages to be just mysterious enough that I still want to know more about what is being covered up.",1214352000,,495,4.573033707865169
