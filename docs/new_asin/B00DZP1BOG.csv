5880339,5,B00DZP1BOG,"If you love Rankin/Bass AND Hanna-Barbera's Christmas classics, then you'll enjoy this bunch of classics! 2008's A Miser Brothers' Christmas wasn't actually made by Rankin/Bass, but by the Warner Premiere division and Cuppa Coffee Studios, as a follow-up to The Year Without A Santa Claus. Every disc in here has bonus programs, in the case of A Miser Brothers' Christmas, a behind-the-scenes featurette on it called What Makes Stop-Motion Go. 1979's Jack Frost is truly by Rankin/Bass, featuring Pardon-Me-Pete the famous groundhog as the story's narrator, voiced by Scuttle the seagull himself, Buddy Hackett. With Jack Frost, you get a bonus program about how to make some ""snowflakey"" Crafty Creations and sing-alongs to some of the songs in this special. 1982's Yogi Bear's All-Star Comedy Christmas Caper is one of 3 Hanna-Barbera Christmas classics starring Yogi and his gang (The previous 2 were 1979's Casper's First Christmas, one of their collaborations with Harveytoons, and the feature-length TV movie from 1980, Yogi's First Christmas). In their last Christmas escapade, Yogi and Boo Boo stowaway on a tourist bus to the big city, to spend Christmas where their gang of friends live, such as Huckleberry Hound, Snagglepuss, Quick Draw McGraw, and numerous others who appear in it, plus a cameo by 2 stars who were way out of their time period; Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble! Leave it to Yogi to get him and Boo Boo in trouble with the law with ""kidnapping"" Judy Jones, daughter of workaholic billionaire J. Wellington Jones. This beloved holiday classic comes with a bonus program, which is actually the series finale to the original Yogi Bear Show in 1962; Yogi's Birthday Party. And last but not least, A Flintstones Christmas Carol was the 4th and last Flintstones' Christmas classic, not counting Fred and Barney's cameo in Yogi's own last Christmas special. This one is a 70-minute TV movie from 1994, during Hanna-Barbera's ""Wild and Crazy Days"" which were known for 2 Stupid Dogs, The Town Santa Forgot, Yogi the Easter Bear, Scooby Doo's Arabian Nights, The What A Cartoon Show, Dumb and Dumber: The Animated Series, Dexter's Laboratory and The Powerpuff Girls (alias the Whoop#%& Girls), just to name a few projects. Luckily, A Flintstones Christmas Carol was nowhere near as wacky, but still a beloved classic from such a time period in toon history, in fact it debuted just 1 year after the Emmy-nominated Flintstone Family Christmas special did. This one has a bonus program as well, 1964's A Christmas Flintstone, alias How The Flintstones Saved Christmas, where Fred plays the Macyrock department store Santa and fills in for the real deal afterwards, with elves Twinky and Blinky to help him out. Don't let the labeling fool you, all the classics contained in this 4-disc set are meant for everyone who enjoys Rankin/Bass and Hanna-Barbera's Christmas classics, not just kids. If you love both brands of Christmas classics, and don't already have these on their own, go ahead and get this 4-disc set and save some money and shelf space! Whether you prefer a White Christmas or a Green one, this set's a shoo-in for a Yabba-Dabba-Doo Yule Time, any old time!",1400630400,13,3190,5.055028462998102

This is the most wonderful set of classics available. I grew up on these movies, as did my children. I thought this year when they open PJ's I would add this movie in with the pajama's. Everyone knows they get them, it is a traditional Christmas Eve gift, this year I am following a friends advice and putting each couples pajama's together on the bottom, but this movie set is the real ""newly added"" tradition  after we are all home cozy in the pj's they will have a movie to watch together reliving their youth (and let's pray giving me a grandbaby) along with popcorn and hot cocoa.

I have a few more of these on the way, I think this will be something they do now even after I am gone~  Thank you Amazon",1448409600,,1025,5.053254437869822
