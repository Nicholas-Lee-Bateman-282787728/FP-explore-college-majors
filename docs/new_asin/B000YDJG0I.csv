3026140,1,B000YDJG0I,"This movie is Robert Redford's very uninformed and pedantic view of the war crammed into nearly two hours of shallow dialog.

Shallow dialog is really about all I can say to describe the movie.  It's about as interesting as dryer lint.  The imagery from the military scenes was surprisingly realistic and accurate (I am an Iraq War vet and nothing makes me angrier than when a movie portrays the military and doesn't take the time to get basic things like uniforms and equipment right) but that is where my praises for this movie end.  The story line was not interesting, compelling, nor did it bring anything new to the table.  It was just a slew of half-truths about why we should just disengage from the wars embedded in a forced story line where all anti-war advocates are smart and witty, and all of the hawks are just bumbling morons.

If you have anti-war views (notice I am avoiding using ""liberal"" as a derogatory) you will probably swoon at this movie, as it is candy for your crowd.

If you are hawkish, you will want to scream in the theater as Redford portrays you as a smugly naive chicken hawk.  Unless of course you're in the military, in which case we are portrayed as just a naive pawn in this dreadful war of hubris.  At all costs, Mr. Redford, don't ever present the idea that there may be mentally competent people who both believe in the war on terror, AND sign up to fight.  My gosh, that might railroad your precious idea that we're all a bunch of witless thugs with good intentions.

The entire thing was highly telling of a very disengaged view of the world from the ivory tower Redford lives in.",1195171200,13,1622,4.501706484641638
3026141,5,B000YDJG0I,": We had heard very little about  LIONS FOR LAMBS  but were eager to see these three actors in what sounded like a big-deal movie. We have also long valued Redford. We had heard about one apathetic-to-negative review in a major journal and fortunately we disregarded it. (When we got home I went onto the Internet and found a whole slew of condescending-to-hostile responses to the film.) We came out of the theatre immensely moved, with an excitement that we had not felt during and after a current movie for a very long time. I have sat, totally un-engaged, watching with a kind of detachment, feeling at long distance, watching George Clooney chase around among murky criminal mysteries in MICHAEL CLAYTON, or trying to get find some human element amid the editor's zap-zapping in the BOURNE movies while Matt Damon's real personality and style got swallowed up in all that racket, or I was slouched in my seat trying to give Ben Affleck the benefit of the doubt for his first effort as director in GONE BABY GONE and I wondered how long I could hang in  there as the sleaze got  more and repelling. For LIONS FOR LAMBS my wife and I were both halfway up toward the screen, way beyond edge-of-the seat.

 I came home and read a slew of apathetic or even hostile responses on the Internet. I couldn't believe it... Did they see the same film we had? Then I realized yet again that right now audiences and movie reviewers get in a panic if they feel they are being pushed to an opinion or a view, being ""taught,"" talked at.  This amounts now to the to the kind of panic that we used to say when a film was alleged to be ""sentimental.""

 LIONS FOR LAMBS is not preachy, not dutiful, ""educational"" or ""good for you."" It is eloquent, perceptive and dramatically riveting. I haven't been aware of listening that intently in a movie in a very long time. Dialogue, people talking, seems to have gone out of movies. That is left for novels, some stage plays and some TV.  This movie is written, so that when people speak, they say things that express who they are, where they are hurting or excited or struggling or passionate. It's a golden opportunity for the actors, the three stars and several others. Redford is not just a presence in our cultural life and a celebrant and furtherer of quality films. He is an astute director and his own kind of passionate actor. He plays a college professor, a long way from the Sundance Kid, a teacher struggling to get through to a cynical, bright and stalled student. It's impossible to miss  this teacher's passionate commitment.

Tom Cruise, an actor so easily dismissed because of highly publicized media events, gives a devastating portrayal of a smooth, charming, manipulative senator on the rise.  Meryl Streep plays a journalist, in her 50's, whose own vision, conscience, and awareness develop before our eyes.  It's an astounding portrayal of someone learning, discovering beyond an already sophisticated base. And anyone who is ""in education"", as teacher, counselor, parent, knows the feeling of coming face to face with a hugely frustrating, vividly promising young person , powerfully embodied by Andrew Garfield, an actor new to me.

There is a lot more. A whole third piece to the drama has two college students making a very major decision with very major results 3000 miles from the classroom.  But I'll stop with this: please don't miss this movie. And when people tell you  ""the reviews"" were apathetic or hostile, pay no attention.

 We are still intently there, listening to those conversations, watching those events, seeing the faces and images, almost holding our breath to get it all, not to miss anything. I urge you to see it.

3026142,3,B000YDJG0I,"An overtly political thought-provoker from old school Hollywood liberalist Robert Redford, Lions For Lambs marks the first feature from the revamped United Artist studio. Exploring the faith of two US soldiers dropped behind enemy lines through three parallel narratives all linked to the two men, Lambs marks an extreme departure for Tom Cruise the actor, as he plays a Machiavellian hotshot Republican senator who gives a one hour interview to Streep's experienced (if somewhat disillusioned) reporter. Meanwhile, Robert Redford's idealistic college professor lectures a potentially brilliant, but lazy student on the dangers of not harnessing his natural leadership skills, by using two of his former students (the two now lost in Afghanistan) as an example of standing for something they truly believed in. Designed purely to poke the waning fires of debate, Lions For Lambs is a powerful film that asks questions not only of the American government, but also its citizens and (most notably) its media. The point here is a simple but staggeringly profound one - if you don't stand for something, then you fall for everything.  Performance-wise, Cruise holds up surprisingly well, as he plays Senator Jasper Irving with a hint of a narcissistic undertone that gives the movie star his best role since just that flick. It may not be the Oscar contender some had predicted, and it may not set the box office alight, but it is an effective catalyst for diplomacy through art, and will surely spark communicative efforts, even amongst the least political viewer. Smart and engaging, with a reflective power, Lions For Lambs is not perfect filmmaking by any means, as it falters slightly around the middle - but it still begs for mass viewings from an information-starved public.",1195084800,3,1777,5.191637630662021
3026143,4,B000YDJG0I,"This movie is obiviously commentary on the current sittuation in Iraq.

Playing the proverbial college professor, Robert Redford is concerned that some of the students who profess to be 'inspired by him' ultumately decide to enroll in the millitary. For he had not actually encouraged them to enlist, just to do something with their lives to make a difference in the world. He is convinced that this intervention is not the best way to make a difference in the world.

Meanwhile, Tom Cruise is the villan. He plays Senator Jasper Irving, the Republican, who not incidentally is the quintisental hawk. Cruise can really play evil good. Honestly, I forgot that this was the same man who I and several other women swooned over growing up. I was also certain that this portion of the screenplay is a thinly veiled commentary on ever shrinking Congressional identification with the GOP/retirements.

It's a good movie. The only reason why I am convinced it's not getting heavy attendance in theaters is because people don't neccessarily want a 'serious' movie during the holiday season. This might be something which would attract large crowds during the summer. The people who do go in will not be disappointed.",1194912000,4,1207,4.9950248756218905
3026144,2,B000YDJG0I,"LIONS FOR LAMBS preached and talked me out. I was exhausted looking at talking heads (albeit it really famous ones) when I would have rather ""heard"" this film over NPR Radio! Fortunately,its 80+ minutes was about all I really could have stood from Redford's unengaging cinematic approach to LIONS FOR LAMBS.I am not suggesting that what this film has to say is anything at all that I would personally disagree, it 's just simply I found the style of the film 100% un-cinematic and uninteresting. Frankly, a documentary such as NO END IN SIGHT was IMO far more compelling than this turkey,Streep,Cruise,Redford or no Streep,Cruise,Redford;  their presence does not make this a great film to watch just like the recent remake of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.Doesn't the old saying go,""Children should be heard and not seen""?....well, if it doesn't it should!
Glad I got to see this at a free screening. It was a major disappointment!",1194825600,4,927,4.980645161290322
3026145,3,B000YDJG0I,"""Give a Damn!"" That was Yippie* leader Jerry Ruben's axiom during the sixties.  He also said, ""Do It!""  Another famous slogan was, ""If you're not a part of the solution, you're a part of the problem.""  Although not axiomatic, Professor Stephen Malley (Robert Redford) reaches out to one of his brightest students, Todd (Andrew Garfield), and barters with him to come back and attend his class.  The banter between Dr. and student is filled with wit and insight.  Still, Dr. Malley makes those sayings new [from his perspective] as a Vietnam War veteran whose only injuries were sustained on the picket line when he returned home and protested the war.  Yet, that is the statement of 'Lions for Lambs' theme:  Take a stand and do something.  (*That's not a typo; it stood for Y.outh I.nternational P.arty.)

In the meantime, a Peggy Noonan-esque reporter, Janine Bach (Meryl Streep), is interviewing G.O.P. Senator Jeremy Irving (Tom Cruise) in his private chamber.  As they speak, new troops are filtering into the mountains of Afghanistan, one meant to bring a victory to the War on Terror and build momentum for toppling Iran's nuclear capability.  He offers her an exclusive pipeline to his office and the developments of this new ""surge"" in troops.  She comes cordially--like she's a friend--but isn't afraid to ask tough questions during the interview--but they are the kind a conservative columnist would certainly ask.  Will she take his offer?  In later scenes, she and her editor spar over just that.

The third front brings the only real action of the picture.  Colonel Falco briefs and commands his troops sent via chopper to the mountains of Afghanistan.  His Q and A session with his men, particularly with Ernest Rodriguez (Michael Pena) tells us a good deal.

Much of the movie is a one on one debate between two speakers, each playing Devil's Advocate for one another.  In similar fashion, I will now engage in a debate on the merits of the movie with my own Devil's Advocate.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devil's Advocate:  This film is like the title of an old Psychedelic Furs album, 'Talk, Talk, Talk'.  Why should anyone want to see it?

JP:  One has to take the film by its quality--not by its format--'My Dinner with Andre' is considered one of Louis' Malle's masterpieces--and all it has is talk.

D.A.:  You've never seen `My Dinner with Andre'.  How would you know?

JP:  Well, it's one of the most revered movies.  It's like on  those ""Greatest Movies"" lists by Roger Ebert, et al. Even to rent it you have to practically inherit a copy from a deceased relative for cry eye!  In principle it still proves a good movie can have just talk.

D.A.:  Why not see a documentary--like 'No End in Sight'?

JP:  The wit and banter of this movie are formidable.  I mean--I think they grapple at the truth, skipping the idea that everything's all black and white.  They ask the right questions and at least offer some compelling answers--not final answers, mind you, but good ones.  By all means, see both.

D.A.:  Why not save your money and stay at home and watch CNN and Fox News each for half an hour?

JP:  The caliber is richer and more condensed in this movie.  It's more worthwhile.

DA:  Is this cinematic ping pong match really better than sitting on your couch and watching Jon Stewart?

JP:  I don't know if it's better...It's just different.  It challenges you from all sides.  The movie asks difficult questions and makes some great, pointed observations.

D.A. Is anyone going to win an Oscar for this movie?

JP:  No, but the performances are natural and believable throughout.

DA:  Why should we believe a reviewer who gave one star to 'Conversations with Other Women' and two stars to 'The Death of Mr. Lazarescu,' but also gave 'The Guardian' four stars and 'Flyboys' five?!

JP:  When I sat down to give points to movies at the end of the year, I discovered  that while 'The Death...' was too ""real time,"" and I still hated 'Conversations...'; objectively, they were well crafted and original.  I still felt better about those two favorites, but they fell in value.  You have a point, though.  Now that I have a point system I use, I can be more objective than just how I feel about a movie.

DA:  You're on the defensive, I see, but I have to admit that you have improved.  But, this conversation is going nowhere, which is about what I'd say about the movie.

JP:  It's just like you to try and have the last word.

DA:  Yep.  But, remember,  you're the one controlling the dialogue for both of us.  It's contrived, just like the exchange in the movie...See yah!!!",1194825600,5,4649,4.782828282828283
3026146,4,B000YDJG0I,"No matter what your political bent, this movie was dramatic and extremely thought-provoking.  The acting by Redford, Streep and Cruise was excellent as usual and did not disappoint.  As a movie-goer who goes to movies to be entertained and/or to have my thoughts invigorated, I found both to be true in this case.  I came away angry all over again at the politicians who have placed our men and women in harm's way with no viable exit strategy.  Both parties carry equal blame and I have yet to find a realistic answer to the problem but this film has renewed my resolve to be part of the solution.",1194739200,5,598,4.5092592592592595
3026147,2,B000YDJG0I,"**1/2

""Lions For Lambs,"" director Robert Redford's all-star dissertation on life in a post-9/11, ""War on Terror""-dominated world (and easily the most sermonizing movie since ""Crash""), takes place in three entirely separate locales: a United States senator's office in Washington D.C., an unnamed university campus in California, and a remote, snow-covered hillside in rural Afghanistan.

In the first setting, Tom Cruise plays a smarmy Republican lawmaker who has decided to grant an exclusive briefing to a seasoned political reporter (Meryl Streep) regarding a new military strategy the Americans are implementing in Afghanistan.  In the second sphere, Redford is a veteran political science professor who is trying to convince a bright but deeply cynical student to overcome his apathy and to become actively engaged in the political process.  Finally, Michael Pena and Derek Luke are two of the professor's former students who a few years earlier decided to put their lives on the line by joining some special op forces and who are currently trapped behind enemy lines after the helicopter on which they are riding comes under intense artillery fire while on a mission.

Thoughtful and timely political discourse is such a rare commodity on American screens these days that one feels downright ungrateful for not responding more positively to Redford's film.  Matthew Michael Carnahan's screenplay comes with an obviously liberal slant, but it does try more than most to be reasonably fair-minded in the points it is making and to see things from a multiplicity of angles.  The problem is that, for all its good intentions, the film comes across more like a TV or radio debate than a full-fledged fictional drama.  Redford's talking-heads directorial style results in a series of static mini lectures, virtually devoid of passion, cohesion or drama.  How can Redford expect the audience to get all worked up and agitated about the issues he's presenting when he himself seems to be having so much trouble doing so?

The didactic tone leaves very little room for any actual character development, with the people in the film functioning as little more than convenient mouthpieces for the writer and director.  This is a shame because the movie has some cogent points to make about patriotism, political apathy, materialism, celebrity culture, the government's use of fear and paranoia in manipulating the masses, and the responsibility a free press has in exposing corruption and deceit, particularly in a time of national crisis.  Yet, the movie itself is so academic, inert, and talky that whatever issues it is raising get submerged in the tedium.  Oddly, the movie has a clunky disjointedness that one generally encounters in films adapted from stage plays, even though the screenplay in this case is apparently an original creation.

In the role of actor, Redford comes across as smug and condescending as the professor, while Todd Hayes exhibits zero charisma as the supposedly brilliant boy whose soul Redford seems intent on saving (or, at least, kick-starting into the future).  Cruise and Streep play off each other well in the scenes they have together, and it's especially interesting watching Streep portraying a character who is the antithesis of the one she plays in the similarly-themed (but much better) ""Rendition.""  Pena and Luke are given far too little screen time to make much of an impression as the two lads who demonstrate their patriotism through actions rather than mere words.

One could live with the movie's preachiness if the film itself were at least well done, but ""Lions For Lambs"" fails because it commits the one unpardonable sin of dramaturgy - it places its story at the service of the message rather than the other way around.  Thus, instead of a work of art, what we get is a piece of well-intentioned agitprop - a high class poli sci lesson in place of a compelling movie.",1194652800,12,3917,5.122448979591836
3026148,4,B000YDJG0I,"The title ""Lions for Lambs"" refers to a quote from a German General during WWI regarding the British army.  The Germans were most impressed with the Brit soldiers' fighting ability, but they didn't particularly respect the men who commanded them. Essentially, unblooded, starched collar men were setting objectives for a war they knew nothing about.

""Lions for Lambs"" takes place over a very short period of time--less than a day in three separate scenarios. It opens with Janine Roth (Meryl Streep), a veteran reporter of 40 years, being granted an exclusive one on one hour with Senator Jasper Irving.  In the interview, the Senator extols that Ms. Roth help him sell a new initiative for the US war with Afghanistan. This initiative had begun 10 minutes before their interview commenced. Essentially, the US Forces in Afghanistan are going to use small point insertion of troops to break the enemy's back--very similar to the plan General Abrams used in Viet Nam. Can the Senator get Ms. Roth's support for this new plan and sell it to the US people?

Next, we see Prof Steven Malley (Robert Redford) talking with Todd (Andrew Garfield, a student from his political science class. He offers Todd a deal--either accept a blue collar B for A work and non-attendance or entertain a proposition. Why did he offer it?  Because Todd was one of the few students who showed true potential and encouraging those people to do something with their lives was why Malley still taught college. Can he convince Todd to enter the program he's suggesting?

The final set of people we see are two students Prof Malley mentioned in his talk with Todd. Ernest Rodriguez (Michael Pea) and Arian Finch (Derek Luke) are two of the US Special Forces unit who are parachuting into Afghanastan to ""show the enemy the full measure of American mean."" Their helocopter is fired on due to poor intelligence and Rodriguez is knocked out of the craft. Arian follows him in the jump--to stay with his 'brother' in both arms and spirit. The damaged helo has to leave due to the continued fire. Can Command get a chopper back in time to rescue the two brave soldiers?

These are the basic questions involving the three groups of people, but of course there's more discourse than that.  Essentially, the Senator's and Professor's portions of the film are all talk and the two soldiers' are mostly action. Redford manages to entwine the three storylines almost flawlessly. There are only a couple of flashbacks in Redford's own scenes and they forward the story along. Performances by all the major cast were excellent.  Meryl Streep was the best I have ever seen.

My one star deduction is for the simplicity and heavy-handedness of the message. ""Lions"" came a hair close to being preachy.",1194566400,19,2757,4.859275053304904
3026149,3,B000YDJG0I,"Perceptively enlightened, Robert Redford's political propaganda film ""Lions for Lambs"" loosely translates into smart entertainment. Exceptionally strong acting and fully fleshed characters are unfortunately unable to disguise Redford's opinionated brand of current events, and he often teeters dangerously close to the edge of being an army recruiter. Despite the occasional overbearingly preachy tone, the three steadily converging storylines showcase top-notch direction and allow clever dialogue fodder for the always enjoyable cast to consume with pomp, irony and satire.

Senator Jasper Irving (Tom Cruise) calls upon reporter Janine Roth (Meryl Streep) to receive an exclusive one-hour interview with himself to discuss his new plan to win the war on terror. As he engages in a verbal struggle to make the veteran reporter see his reasoning, his plan of action is already taking effect as a top-secret mission in the Middle East finds two best friends Arian and Ernest (Derek Luke and Michael Pena) abandoned in the cold confines of an icy plateau, waiting for rescue and surrounded by the enemy. Meanwhile, Dr. Stephen Malley (Robert Redford), the professor who negotiated with the two soldiers not to go to war, holds a meeting with another hopeful student who shows promise and potential.

Lions for Lambs demonstrates Redford's seasoned talents as a director through the use of three initially separate storylines progressing simultaneously. As the film draws to a close, it becomes more apparent how closely those three groups of people are related, the fact that all three events take place at the same time, and the extreme differences in world affair opinions that each group holds. Despite the occasional flashback, the film is entirely sequential and in chronological order - something few films still do, especially when multiple plot lines are concerned.

Lions for Lambs works as both a public service announcement and Redford's own propaganda. While Janine condemns Irving's elusively intelligent words and intimidating propaganda, Redford also spoon feeds the audience with his perceptions of the war on terror. What saves the film from collapsing on its own hypocrisy is the outstanding performances by all of the main characters. In a moment of climactic cinematic irony, Cruise discusses the effectiveness of the trained professional soldiers stationed in the Middle East, as the covert operation over Iran tragically unravels and casualties are quickly incurred.

Cruise is inspired as the fast talking, patriotic, red-blooded American Senator who weaves a tale for the press with powerful words and piercing determination. Streep is equally outstanding as the reporter who, despite years of accepting her role as merely a go-between for ruthless politicians to rally their public image, suddenly gains a conscience that forces her to question her position. Redford stars as the professor who is convinced that his talents lie in discovering students with the potential to make a difference, as he did with Arian and Ernest who he was unable to prevent from going off to fight for their beliefs.

While heavily opinionated propaganda films rarely equal grand entertainment, Redford is careful to insert a grandiose finale that paints a glowing picture for targets of his mindset on the war. Whether you agree with his outlook and his representation of the ""whatever it takes"" attitude of the government, Lions for Lambs is arguably well-made and brilliantly constructed. And Cruise Photoshoped into photographs with President Bush, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice are hilariously priceless.

Meryl Streep indulged in prioritizing character quirks above the actual meat of the script (she's a terrific actress, but playing to the balcony, theater-style, even when the camera is practically in her face, can easily sabotage a story in which the jigsaw pieces of the events have to be understood, yet most directors let her get away with it, and that's probably how she developed this really bad fall-back habit), which pretty much nullified both her character's role and the real-life person's work in the real-life situation/events. And Redford's essentially static staging of his own scenes --if understandable for an actor also directing and on a limited budget and schedule-- pretty much nullified illuminating the egotism of sophomoric college students rationalizing their lazy, shallow life-choices (not something all college students do, as the combat scenes show). I'm not a Tom Cruise fan AT ALL but I have to admit that of all the 'name' stars, he did his job best in this film.",1473552000,3,1205,5.184615384615385

The film does a very clever thing my interleaving three different plot lines in three different parts of the world. It also does a very clever thing by not explaining their connection or pushing a conclusion on the viewer. The ending of the film is a good example. No conclusion is given, the ending is strangely open. And how can it not be? When the question addressed is: what shall we do with this life?

I luv this film, directed by redford. redford isn't getting enough respect from critics, Oscars. looking at this film in light of recent events in irag is amazing. the tom cruise character, sort of a young john McCain conservative, may have been meant to be the antagonist (i.e., conservative ""war monger"") in the film, tho redford presented him and the other characters view points pretty even handedly. with the rise of ISIS in Iraq, the cruise character seems prescient. whatever your politics, this is a well made thought provoking film. the biggest point of the film is how the gov't has almost been given a free hand in what it does by an apathetic public and a spoon fed news media. this point is made with the redford and andrew Garfield (spiderman) characters. the final shot to me is a classic on the level of rosebud in citizen kane. Garfield is watching CNN where the anchor is filling the country in on the latest gossip about some celebrities, while there is a crawl on the bottom of the screen regarding a recent military action, which the film has centered on and which has cost the lives of 2 young patriots we also met in the film. Garfield  and a friend are watching this while loafing on a sofa ""potato couch"" syle. BRILLIANT and oh so true. the country isn't really fully engaged in our wars. and the media is very controlled by a few largely economic interests. this film deserves a look.",1408233600,7,1482,4.613636363636363

3026236,3,B000YDJG0I,"Lions for Lambs is a political drama film about the connection between a platoon of United States soldiers in Afghanistan; a U.S. senator and a reporter; and a college professor and a bright student. It also casts three well-known Hollywood performers in Redford,Streep and Cruise.

This is both a well-acted and a highly-charged political film that will affect many Americans as its themes are about issues that are affecting the United States particularly the Iraq War. It may also have irked many conservatives to the fact that it took a liberal position about the issues discussed.

Unfortunately,it did not do well in the box office as it was talky and the discussions among the characters dominated the film instead of having a story in it. That could have bored many viewers to death especially if one's intention is to watch the film and how their favorite actor/actress perform in it instead having them talk about the current state of affairs of the United States. Added to that,I felt that it also was too early to make a conclusion of how the issues tackled particularly the Iraq War will determine the country's future as well as the to whether it proved to be good or bad to the United States in its history during the time it was released.",1405296000,,1254,4.747706422018348

3026244,4,B000YDJG0I,"I totally agree with the sentiment and intention of this film however it becomes too much of an academic lecture.  I actually think 30 more minutes should have been added to the film with much more emphasis on the two young enlisted men fighting in Afghanistan and less time on the lecture Robert Redford gives to one of his college students.

When the United States is at war, the party in power has to continually spin the story to keep the American public engaged, to frame every event to the advantage of the United States, to simplify every confrontation into good versus evil, and to cover up all the vest interests such as defense contractors that keep the war machine moving. I think Tom Cruise did an outstanding job as a GOP Senator trying to put a new spin on a bogged down situation in Afghanistan.  Anyone who has studied world history knows that Afghanistan is the quick sand black hole of the great powers and England, the USSR, and the United States have all been sucked into this country of tribes and warlords and ever shifting allegiances and resources. Cruise does an admirable job of trying to convince veteran reporter Meryl Streep that this is something new, somehow a light in the forest that will help America defeat the enemy and leave as victors. Of course Streep does not buy it, she realizes we are fighting ghosts and an enemy that can disappear into the villages and crowds without detection. Of course her superiors in the news industry ask her not to analyze the information, just report on the information. Redford is a college political science professor. He has a powerful presence and his idealism shines through his pores, but he gives too long a lecture and I fear that he loses the audience with too many words. He should have made his point with the two former students now fighting in Afghanistan, trying to make a difference in a world that doesnt want anything to be different.

I liked the film, don't get me wrong, and I would recommend it but with a little more action and a little less lecture it could have made a more powerful statement.",1389312000,,2087,4.617250673854447

3026246,2,B000YDJG0I,"Lions for Lambs was, to me, a poor attempt at a good idea. This film is supposed to be showing war from several angles; specifically, the consequences of war and the reactions to it. Tom Cruise' character is the politician using the war to further his campaign. Meryl Streep is the news reporter covering the proposed new plan for the war, and Michael Pena is a soldier fighting this new plan. This was a good THOUGHT, but the execution was done so poorly I couldn't enjoy it. Tom Cruise' new plan was to put small groups of fighters on mountain tops so they could see everything and the enemy can't move. Ask anyone who has served in action and they will laugh at that plan to end terrorism.

Meryl Streep is the veteran journalist, yet she reacts more emotionally then a rookie to every piece of information she discovers. It is very distracting.

Michael Pena and his partner are made out to be a highly trained (Special Forces if I recall correctly?) fighter, who then makes silly decisions that don't make sense.

I love that Carnahan was inspired to write this questioning story after the discomfort of seeing a US soldier death report as a ticker during a college game broadcast. It's amazing how poorly this film performed in its time. Cruise, Redford and Streep are about as big a draw as they come. True, 2007 was when the media was questioning Cruise's sanity.

Streep trying to tolerate being in the same scene with Tom Cruise gave me a bad case of restless leg syndrome. This film is dismissable in its modern context, but will be great-quality MST3K fodder in 30 years. If you take your war movies seriously, give this naff indulgence a miss.

3026258,2,B000YDJG0I,"Felt like a propaganda movie.  I wouldn't say liberal propaganda either, quite the contrary actually.  They could have called it ""Be All You Can Be"".  It delves into some potentially interesting discussion topics, America's presence in the Middle East, the responsibility of the 'apathetic American', crooked politicians, etc.  But overall, the dialogue felt largely scripted, the acting fairly wooden (think 'infomercial'), and there's little if no suspense to the story.. so I guess that means it's a drama.  But not a hugely engaging one at that.  Half the movie is listening to Robert Redford, as a university professor, talking to one of his lazy students in his office and telling him to get his act together, come to class and 'care' about things.  I'm all for caring about things but I still found the movie rather lame.  Definitely no Oscar moments for any of the actors.  Not a character driven movie in any sense. Not a plot driven movie certainly.  What's left?  Well, if you're a high school or university student in need of a good lecture, here's your movie.  On the other hand if you think about it enough it just may inspire you to want to ""do something"".  A call to activism? Perhaps.

I didn't expect much, to be honest.  And, it didn't disappoint.  It validated my reasoning for avoiding it when it was first released.  Be that as it may, I give it 5 stars and recommend it highly to my fellow conservatives.

3026268,4,B000YDJG0I,"Lions for Lambs addresses three areas of our current state of the union. The first is the messianic desire for America being the global and moral police force. Second, the media's morphing from the fourth estate to the fourth branch of government; a complicit enabler of public duping and a whore to ratings and lowest common denominator pandering. Lastly, it delivers a solid punch in the nose to America the Apathetic.

While the back and forth between Streep and Cruise plays like all the other left/right debates on any Sunday morning program, the give and take between Redford as a university professor and his increasingly self-centered but once-promising student is well done. Some have complained that Redford lectures, and he does (he is playing a professor...), but his student volleys with equal skill and you hear a debate that is not heard enough; what's the right choice for someone in this land of plenty?

America has become so powerful and wealthy that we have people who are poor yet fat, and possess cell phones and flat-screens, thus no desire to change their circumstances. The new ""heroes"" of our society are business-people or entrepreneurs, those nauseatingly-dubbed ""job creators,"" whose overarching goal is not the betterment of society but rather the fattening of their bank account. Those people are enabled by politicians who are equally self-serving and cynical. Furthermore, we have become so spoiled by our excess that we no longer care to improve (and in some cases, if one tries to improve America, their loyalty is called into question) or even perpetuate this experiment called The United States of America, but rather seek to get ours while we can and to hell with the future. Lions for Lambs might not solve all these problems, but it need only start the dialogue and get people to think about more than themselves. Wouldn't that be a huge step in the right direction?

And everyone's choice was important.  And everyone was making a choice or living with the consequences of a choice they recently made.
In this approach, the death of these two young men, as they change and impact all these totally different people's life decisions, demonstrates their greatest breadth of humanity.  These young men and the loss of their potential in this world is suddenly not just personally of heroic proportions, but suddenly of earthshaking proportion as well.  Intentionally or not, the immense strength of the connection between people becomes a character of it's own almost at the climactic moment but you don't know it yet!  Not til is shows itself in the last scenes within the lives of these different people.  And in that connectivity is inherently once again the immense value of human life.  Beautiful!  Beautifully done! A new emotional experience- a new way of telling a story- a new rhythm of emotion to help us all learn a new dance of the spirit!  I think it may have irritated some because it didn't have the same climactic feel we have wanted since the days of Greek tragedy.  But you know, Greek Tragedy is a strongly masculine rhythm.  The feminine rhythm is, forgive, slightly different, and though this did not exactly capture that, it gave a much more enlightened rhythm to the partnership of all.

VERY impressive movie, especially Meryl, the reluctant news reporter at the end of her career who refuses to go along with the ""official"" war justifying bulls__t despite warnings from her news editor,  and Redford was BRILLIANT as the college professor who rescues a brilliant student who has fallen into apathy after starting one of the most interesting class debates and discussions, without having done the reading assignment, in an earlier class,  and Cruise was equally brilliant as the up and coming U.S. Senator presidential candidate to be who justifies the war ""strategy"" (sic) with the usual preposterous strategical  rationalizations while two of Redford's former students, who joined the army and are there to ""make a difference"" die minutes before a rescue copter can arrive at a frozen ridge in Afghanistan.

Redford's directed some genuinely terrific films over the years -- ""Quiz Show"", ""The Horse Whisperer"", ""A River Runs Through It"" and ""Ordinary People"" are among his standouts for me -- but the very first rule of movies has always, always been, first and foremost, to ENTERTAIN its audience ... and on THAT score, especially, ""Lions For Lambs"" fails miserably and completely (second only, perhaps, to Brian DePalma's similarly-preachy and -awful, ""Redacted"" -- another movie that was clearly inspired by the war in Iraq).

The film doesn't work on so many levels that it's almost pointless to mention them. Actually, it is pointless. But: poor writing and casting are what sink it. Unconvincing characters speaking mediocre dialogue.

One mini-positive: I can't think of a single film that has gotten journalists right since All the President's Men. Russell Crowe was awful as a journalist in another film where Americans proved they're not so stupid. (Ben Affleck was awful too, but ...) Jennifer Connelly was entirely unconfincing as a photojournalist in Blood Diamond. It's not a short list. But Streep is pretty good here.

3026282,5,B000YDJG0I,"By the mid 1990's Tom Cruise had become the #1 box office star in the world. Because of his huge success in the ""Mission:Impossible"" films he also became known as an action film actor. So it's nice to see Tom in a film without him shooting a gun and trying to kill the bad guys. In ""Lions For Lambs"" Tom plays a U.S. senator giving an interview to a Washington journalist. He discusses the wars in Iran and Afganistan and his take on how the American government is dealing with the War On Terror.

 The film actually deals with three separate storylines with the same theme: the first one with Tom's character; the second in which Robert Redford plays a California college professor where he chats with a college student and discovers the young man's opinion on the wars; and lastly we see two young and brave soldiers actually fighting in the wars and their ultimate demise.

 Critics and fans hated ""Lions For Lambs"" with a passion. I have watched it several times and although it's not Tom Cruise's biggest film it is a thought-provoking and extremely well-written account of one of the most controversial wars in the last 100 years. The movie makes one re-evaluate your own opinions and thoughts on the invasion of Iran and Afganistan, the real reason why these wars started, and should they continue.

 Robert Redford also directed the film and with a $35,000,000 budget the picture made over $60,000,000, so despite what most say it was a success.",1297123200,,1453,4.700787401574803

Unlike any film I've seen recently, it relies primarily on dialogue, rather than action, to deliver its message. Although the main subject of the film is U.S. involvement in a war in Afghanistan, it uses three different story lines, all taking place simultaneously, to portray how the media, government, and education systems can shape and/or manipulate our attitudes about so many things.

Each story line is interesting and thought-provoking in a unique way. Although not a documentary, you can't help but draw many parallels to the current situations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Mostly, it asks us to examine our own personal responsibility and choices to take action, rather than remain apathetic or indifferent.

3026285,3,B000YDJG0I,"Lions For Lambs (2007) was a movie I was anxious to see when I heard about it several years ago before it was released. But then it got bad reviews and I shifted it to my DVDs To Watch list. Finally getting around to it recently, I felt the movie was average (3 stars out of 5). I have enormous respect for Robert Redford and love many of his movies, but this was not one of his better efforts in my opinion. I think the script lacked emotional connection and originality. It was too dry and journalistic for my taste. I do think the acting was good by the supporting cast, but headliners Robert Redford, Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep were all lacking in their performances...and they were the main reasons I was attracted to this movie originally. Cruise simply plays a character that doesn't fit him and it showed. He's stiff and unbelievable in his role as a Republican Senator. Same with Streep as a news reporter I think. And while Redford's teacher did fit him, he simply didn't have enough good scenes and enough depth within the overall story to make up for the rest. The best scenes in the movie are with him and Andrew Garfield (the new Spider-Man), so I recommend watching the movie simply for those scenes.

While some would argue that the reason this movie fails is because of its liberal political bias, I didn't find that to be a problem for me. I think the story was simply not developed enough and not executed in a way to make it connect with its viewers. Technically the movie feels and looks fine. It's another movie that I'm glad to have seen, but probably won't watch again...at least not in the near future.",1286236800,,1628,4.4630872483221475

3026287,5,B000YDJG0I,"Lions for Lambs is not your regular movie with a main plot, two or three antagonists and one protagonist that act to mesmerize its audience with either song and dance or somber melodrama. This movie is a message sender. It is delivered in three discourses of inter-related dialogue occurring between six pivotal characters. Directed by Robert Redford and released on November 9th 2007, I came into this one a bit late.

I am quite glad I did after reading the many well done reviews about this picture, I was convinced to borrow it from my sweetie. Once watched, I immediately transcribed my scribble into meaningful material for this review because I didn't want to give away the whole movie but rather encourage a viewer to sit and watch it for what it delivers without any expectations of past war or drama genre films.

I suggest keeping in mind that conversations with professors and students, journalists and exposes, and power point presentations in classrooms take considerable amounts of time; therefore the 92 minutes this film is drawn out for is for very good reason. You cannot send lambs out to do the the work reserved for lions unless you prep them, guide them, talk to them, learn them and most of all use a 'whatever it takes attitude' to get them to 'wake up and pay attention', and that is a slow process.

The film offers a quality cast of actors in Redford choosing himself of course as Professor Stephen Malley, Meryl Streep (from MamaMia 2008, Doubt 2008, Julie and Julia 2009) as journalist Janine Roth, Tom Cruise (from Tropic Thunder and Valkyrie in 2008) as US Senator Jasper Irving, Michael Pena (from The Lucky Ones 2008 and Observe and report 2009) as soldier Ernest Rodriguez, Andrew Garfield (from The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus 2009) as student Todd Hayes (one of my favorites), Peter Berg (from Hancock 2008 unaccredited) as Lt. Col. Falco, Derek Luke (from Definitely Maybe in 2008 and Medea Goes to Jail in 2009) as soldier Arian Finch and Kevin Dunn (from Vicky Cristina Barcelona in 2008 and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen 2009) as ANX Editor.

I remembered being disappointed with the abrupt ending but then when I saw that same ending on the second viewing I knew there was nothing more to say, that it was the only possible ending because as Redford said in the special features the movie turns the problem over to the audience because it is  our problem, all of it.

3026293,5,B000YDJG0I,"If you're only mildly interested in political movies that focus on the war in the Middle East, you will love this movie. I also believe this movie is ideal for those who appreciate solid acting, especially on the part of Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep.

The storyline is... actually it's divided into three separate stories, each one focusing on the political side of the spectrum.

It's pretty weird at first how the movie keeps jumping around between the three stories, but eventually you'll adjust to the approach the movie writers are going for. It's weird, but it works.

Two of the stories are definitely more interesting than the third. The one involving Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise's character having detailed (though somewhat cool and rational) conversations focusing on the war in Afghanistan is definitely the best of the three storylines (plus they frequently mention Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries, keeping things relevant to the real world).

The other storyline where you see the actual fighting take place over in Afghanistan is probably the second best of the three stories, however, what strikes me as disappointing is the fact that the entire war scene in Afghanistan involving the two soldiers who were on ground and forced to fight for their lives took place at night with snow blowing around, so you couldn't really SEE any of the fighting taking place. This has been a problem with many Hollywood movies as of late- having great difficulty actually seeing the action for whatever reason.

The very end of the film involving the two soldiers is a VERY emotional moment, and probably the best part of the film.

I didn't quite get the significance of the third storyline involving the college student having a classroom conversation with his teacher, unless the meaning is that ""you're young, things change as you get older, so do what you love while you're still young"".

Now, I'm going to be honest here- I'm not someone who normally follows politics, at least, not on a deep level where I feel the need to keep myself up to date every single day on the events taking place around the world. I do watch the news, I do read about many other countries and problems all the time, and I make sure I'm always at least aware what's going on in the world.

However, someone who follows politics on a frequent basis may find much of the storytelling in Lions for Lambs predictable, and nothing they haven't seen before. My logic is- if I can follow along to the storyline easily, someone who's heavy and extremely knowledgeable on politics probably will think the movie isn't that great.

3026317,5,B000YDJG0I,"This is one of the strangest film we can imagine about the end of Dubya's war on terror, alas not the end of the war per se. It is all centered on Afghanistan but it is essentially conveyed in the paranoid fear of human beings. Like the Christian God, this story is based on three characters, three story tellers, three episodes that overlap and crisscross from one to the other constantly. On one side a university professor who was drafted into the Vietnam war and has not yet really understood what happened then. He has negotiated a hypocritical peace with life that makes him take his anger and frustration onto the students themselves in order to confront them to decision making at any time in their life as students when this life has become boring and senseless. They know it is not going to be better than their parent's though the latter have promised them it would. And anyway, and that is what these students have forgotten, it cannot be the same, let alone better because they are just starting in life and nothing in life is given ready made and ready to eat. You have to fight for it, like it or not, and that the dear professor has forgotten it in his own mind, even if the students have forgotten it in their real life. The professor makes the students fight but for the sake of it not for any commitment, even purely selfish. The professor does not do his job since he does not teach them how to start from zero, as life requires it for 95% of people, and then have an objective other than satisfying the wants, desires or phantasms of the professor. He is not even a signpost along the road that never follows the road it is indicating, but he is a signpost in the middle of the desert pointing in any erratic direction according to the moment and the professor's impulses. The journalist in a big newspaper is confronted with  the necessity, or even the duty, to tell the public that everyone is lying to them and they believe them. But she runs out of steam to convince other people, out of steam to really corner the senator who receives her, out of steam to convince her own boss about that necessity instead of treating everything as news when it is only propaganda. She too is sort of out of phase and she will either yield or retire. She is incapable of doing her job for her boss who takes the assignment away, her job being to bring news to the public. But she is also incapable to do what she thinks her job is, that is to say bring people to reflecting and having a wider vision on things, a vision that could integrate the past into the future and vice versa, in other words be responsible and visionary. The senator is a young wolf who is ready to win the war whatever the cost  it may take because that's what politicians need, a win. Instead of drawing the conclusion from the failure that the mistakes are too heavy for life to forgive and forget them and that politicians have to stop these mistakes, they want more war and they look for the person who is going to be able to carry the message to the people and make people swallow the hard medicine instead of changing it altogether. In that trilogy - or should I say trinity? - of lost grown-ups, the film shows a few young students and how they react to this fake life, and it is not at all encouraging.  These students are lost. Whether they want to commit themselves and their life to the big battle against terrorism but they are betrayed by a bunch of incompetent officers and politicians who will announce their death as a victory. Or they want to stay out of it and enjoy life and that makes them drop-outs for one and flunkies for two. No hope there, hence a deep sense of despair. The dice have been cast and no one can decipher the message written among the dots and figures. Two years later what can we think about it? It will take a lot of energy - and hope - on the side of politicians to change their ways. It will take a lot of energy for the people to understand enjoying life cannot be the objective of life itself. It will take a lot of energy for the media to understand that their job is not to transmit the press releases of politicians but to educate and enlighten the public into thinking with their own heads. It will take a lot of energy, though I am afraid this battle is far from even having begun, for professors and teachers, educators and intellectuals to get down into the world and commit themselves to real life, which would mean more work and less ease for them, the poor darlings, my heart is bleeding for them. To defend their privileges, these professors and company are ready to break the life of their students as students and then as grown-ups and even as citizens, and they will argue that the students agree. There is always one rotten apple in a barrel of apples, as old seafarers well know.

This movie is complex in the sense that it didn't provide a neatly summarized and easily digestible answer to what is a very complicated question, mortality (i.e., how to get the best value out of ones life).

By interweaving the different plots it conveyed a contrast that couldn't have been accomplished otherwise.

But most importantly, this movie is about choices.  Whether your a journalist who realizes you are doing a disservice to your profession by going along to get along, or whether you're a student that finds comfort in being cynical as opposed to buckling down to change things for the better or perhaps if you choose to put your safety in harms way for the greater good, these are all choices that may not fit easily in one's comfort zone.  Tough choices indeed, and as such should not be expected to be dealt with cavalierly.

It's pure liberal propaganda, a documentary buried in the look, but never reality of story within it's 3 interlaced pretences at stories.  A ""story"" has literary elements, (say, ""rules of engagment"") including character, plot, setting, denoument, climax, any one of which missing renders it mere chatter.  This offered only character, opinionated characters, poorly developed.

I recently read some Hollywood somebody defending such a story as this, claiming that life has no climaxes or endings, so such stories are more realistic.  I can only pity the one who views life in such a way.  All lives DO end, and all choices lead to denouments and climaxes, whether the individual wishes to graph his own or not.  Those who spend theirs ""looking for themselves,"" and whining, ""What's it all about?"" while seeking escape in whatever poison they chose, are simply not living as God intends.  The life that is not worth dying for was not worth living.

Who could care what happened to any of these characters, other than the 2 on the battlefield, and they were far from realistic, behaving out of character for special forces fighters.

As the film gets rolling we learn that in Washington, D.C. the senator has allocated an entire hour for an inverview with the reporter.  At the same time on the west coast the professor is having a one-hour meeting with a student who shows great promise, but who is not striving to meet his own potential, and around the world we see what the two former students are doing in Afghanistan.  As time ticks by the senator reveals a new military strategy for Afghanistan, the professor tells his student about his two former students who volunteered for the army and are serving in Afghanistan, and we see how the new military strategy affects the students that are in the army.

The story develops as the interview progresses, the meeting moves along, and the fates of the two soldiers serving in Afghanistan are shown...all during the same one-hour time period.

With all the excellent independent films he has viewed through his Sundance film festival, I thought ""Lions for Lambs"" would do a better job of dissecting the sorts of narratives we receive from the establishment.  So, it was disappointing to see the Afghani fighters portrayed as amorphous blobs on the screen, set in a scenario where the audience is to cheer for their destruction (that is, kill the ""other"" before the two likeable American boys are killed).  U.S. soldiers are portrayed as pure and heroic, Afghani soldiers are evil blobs.  This is the sort of narrative that entrenches a superiority complex in the American mind.

3026334,3,B000YDJG0I,"When I first saw the trailers and previews for the movie I thought it looked very intriguing, especially with the actors on board. Then I heard pretty quickly that it was nose-diving at the box office, mainly because of its strong political bent to the left. Now, considering most of the country had already given up on the president and reasons for going to Iraq, and this movie was STILL getting reviews of being too far to the left I thought ""Holy cow it must really be slanted"". So I skipped the theatre experience for that reason. I just now finished watching the movie on dvd and I have to say, while there is a leftward bent to it, the bent is not as pronounced as I thought it would be. I thought they juxtaposed the reasons for and against waging war in the middle east with fairly equal consideration. Certainly, the character of GOP Senator played by Tom Cruise is painted as a manipulator of the press in the movie. But I actually thought that the dialogue was fairly factually based, and the debate his character engages in with the moderately left leaning reporter played by Meryl Streep was fairly written in the script. I think the Senator brought up many important moral points to consider in the ""good vs evil and where does America fit into this"" debate.  And for that I give director Robert Redford credit, as I know he is very liberal. I have to say I didn't feel like I was watching a movie about a story, but rather something more akin to a Meet the Press debate. Which is fine, as I am interested in international politics. But that could be why it didn't do so well at the theatres and maybe why there were always stacks of dvds available at Blockbuster, as the movie can come across fairly politically preachy. I have to assume this is what turns most viewers off and killed word of mouth. Clearly Redford wanted to use this medium to tell us all what he thinks of the country and the GOP, which ain't much. Moving on... As I'm sure the other reviews mention, there are three dialogues or stories taking place - the Senator speaking with a reportor, the political science professor (Redford) motivating a gifted yet already cynical student to go into public office to make a difference in the world, and the story of two of the professor's earlier political science students deciding to serve their country by entering the military and going to battle in Afghanistan, which is really the only ""story"" part of the movie. I thought the script was well written, highly intelligent, fast paced and engaging. For this reason I think anyone with intelligence or the desire to gain knowledge in these areas will enjoy this movie, even if you disagree politically with what it is saying. It never hurts to consider different viewpoints. For the script-dialogue I give the movie 5 stars. For the plot of the film I give it 2 stars.  There really is no plot, just a lot of discussion and points of ethics and morality to ponder as we Americans try to define our future role in this crazy world.",1216512000,3,3010,4.541436464088398

3026336,4,B000YDJG0I,"This movie flopped at the box office, but it certainly didn't deserve to.  It's an intelligent, incisive, and surprisingly balanced film that addresses ongoing concerns about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan without pretension.  It's talkative and politically charged, so it's not a movie for those looking for escapist fare (as the final scene suggests most Americans are).  The most common criticism of Lions for Lambs is that its points have been echoed repeatedly by political pundits, and while that's true to some extent, there are a number of perspectives presented here that, as a whole, form an intriguing and thought-provoking work.

Director Robert Redford takes three different points of view on the overarching subject of the War on Terror: one from a hotshot Republican senator (Tom Cruise), another from a weary but still vocal history professor (Redford), and the last from two soldiers stranded on a mountaintop in Afghanistan (Derek Luke and Michael Pea) waiting for rescue but facing an imminent strike by Taliban inhabitants.  Cruise is providing an interview to a TV reporter (Meryl Streep) and Redford is making a desperate attempt to one of his students to extract him from the political apathy that has started to consume him.

The acting is uniformly good, but Cruise and Redford especially stand out.  Cruise is outstanding as the senator who is so charismatic he even convinces himself of his own lies.  Cruise doesn't just play an unctuous pen pusher though; he imbues his character with more complexity than that.  This is a man who genuinely wants to win the wars he helped get his country into and is willing to acknowledge some of his mistakes.  He doesn't want to lose any more lives than he has to, but he is also undaunted in his mission.  Redford presents a notable foil, even if the two never meet: his professor has the experience and the pain to back up his arguments, even if he is getting tired of spouting them.  There's an elegance to his performance but also an urgency to it.

The beauty of Redford's approach is that it shows the political rhetoric (as exemplified by Cruise's character), public response (seen most clearly through Redford's character interacting with his dismayed student), and the consequences (portrayed in the Afghanistan scenes) of the wars that the US government has ignited.  Most of the movie shifts between these three scenes, with some flashbacks that illuminate how a few key characters got to the states they ended up in.  It's a smart move, because it juxtaposes several different sides of the arguments for and against the wars and doesn't overwhelm the viewer with one section for too long.

The impact of the three sections is fuller and more comprehensive in this way.  At the movie's climax, all of the issues come together, and by the time the movie is over, the impact is that much more powerful.  Between the political and academic debates and the action on the ground that is the result of political decision-making, Redford successfully shows how all of us are affected by these wars in different ways.  Whether being motivated to surmount bureaucratic incompetence or deceived by its machinations, and between choosing to question and engage our political leaders and reporters or turning away from them in jadedness or indifference, we are all affected in some way and determine how complicit we become.  Americans may not be ready to engage a movie that portrays such a tragic current event, or want to for that matter, as box office receipts have repeatedly shown, but perhaps that's part of the problem.  Although long-winded at times, Lions for Lambs nevertheless understands and illuminates these messages effectively.",1216166400,,3711,5.02120717781403
3026337,5,B000YDJG0I,"The film Lions for Lambs is an honest attempt to portray the spicy geopolitical climate in its raw, unedited and costly truth. The film takes place in three films, one between two brother's in arms, another between a student and his teacher and another between a journalist and a pathocratic senator. Each vignette offers an illuminating look at the reality of our situation, and I mean our because each one of us can somehow fit into the film itself.

The brother's in arms are interestingly, two previous students of the professor we're introduced to. We're shown their military adventure in Afghanistan as they attempt to fulfill a new strategy issued by the senator. Their characters are bold, courageous, and strong-willed. They have an incredible power of conscience, and a desire to do what is right. Their failing? They lack accurate psychological knowledge of the men who lead them. They are Lions for Lambs.

The pathocratic senator is played exceedingly well by Tom Cruise. I'd never thought I'd enjoy his performance as much as I did in this film. He shows a psychopathic ability to mix words, to tug on a normal man's emotions, to lie with the cunning conviction he is right, more then that - that he is righteous - because he possesses a pathological nature that prevents him from seeing, thinking or believing otherwise. The journalist who shares his entire vignette is played by Meryl Streep, and her desire to honestly do her job and do it right comes through strong. She is invited by the senator for an hour to discuss the 'new strategy' in Afghanistan, and to help relay it to the public. She does an excellent job of asking the questions anyone of conscience would ask, and we can see Cruises' character's pathology if we pay attention.

The last vignette is between Robert Redford, who plays a professor at an unnamed California University and a student of his that shows much promise. The student has potential, but feels as if he'd be happier with a 'normal life', keeping his head down, getting a good job, and making the best out of his life without trying to play a big role in world events. He makes a good argument, but is countered by experience, wisdom and an understanding which he cannot quite grasp due to his youth. For the greater part of the interaction we're not even sure if an impact is made, if his armor is dented, but there is hope reflected in the very last scene that makes the entire bit worth it.

The core of the film is a display of the reality of our situation here in America. Our politicians are self-serving, lying, pathological monsters who are irredeemable and incapable of change. The establishment that is Mainstream Media is saturated with people who are solely 'doing their job' or so they think, by reporting what they are told - propaganda or not. Some of them are damn good people, who have a strong conscience, but due to circumstance (mostly age and financial obligations) cannot change. Their potential to be something different has dried up.

Then we are shown the best and the brightest. Two out of three of which ended up believing their abilities would best be used serving this country in it's war effort. They had the conscience, the dedication and the will to do something new, bold and dramatic - but they didn't have the knowledge that would have allowed their effort to really make an impact, and the results are given to us dramatically.

The third student is a wild card, we're really not sure what he does by the end of the film, but we're given hope that he may attempt something great - to succeed or fail matters not, but that he may attempt it gives us hope. In my mind I saw all of us as that third student. Young, smart, definitely lazy and more interested in social life and girls then knowledge and wisdom which would allow him to fight to change the world. He is the future, the potential future, it exists only as a potential because it is possible, but extremely difficult to manifest. It can only happen with dedication, conscience, and knowledge - which are much more difficult to acquire then a video game, television show, sports event or event a really hot lay.

That is the core of the film, if we want to make an impact, to make positive changes to our world, to become our potential as individuals and as a society we have to want it, we have to try for it, and we have to make it a daily effort.",1215388800,3,4393,4.6028097062579825

I watched this film for a political science class.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  There was soem really great dialogue here and the views were well balanced.  Nothing, aside from the two friends ""last stand"" at the film's end seemed hacknyed.

A lot of people complained that the movie was boring because it lacked action.  I for one, disagree.  I thought that the ideas being flushed out in the film, as well as the tension between the senator (Cruise) and the reporter (Streep), the proffesor and the bright student, and the Rodriguez and Finch's arguments with their classroom really drove this film.  And that's the problem that other's might have with it; the film is character driven, not action.

There's a lot of great ideas here.  Are we repeating the same mistakes as we did in Vietnam?  Is the news media more concerned with revenue and entertainment than it is actual news?  Does public relations drive the political process?  Also, I really liked Finch and Rodriguez's argument that the United States practises ""engagement"" all over the world, but we do not engage many of our own neighbourhoods.

But while Senator Irving and Reporter Roth are debating the pro and con of this War; while Professor Malloy tries to light a fire under his apathetic student; two idealistic young men, full of potential, fight with their last breaths because they believe it takes personal sacrifice to make the U.S.A. a better, safer place.  Who is accountable?  Those of us old enough to have lived through any part of the Vietnam Era, before ""spin"" was a PR term, can recall the indepth coverage the news media gave that war.  A lot of it was pretty awful, grim and heart-wretching, but it didn't allow those safe here at home to bury their heads in the sand.

3026342,5,B000YDJG0I,"I saw this film with my son, who is a senior in high school.  He is a very cynical idealist, very smart, who wants to do something to improve the world, but is almost hopeless than anything can be done to fix the rampant incompetence and dysfunctionality in government and politics, the lack of principle and competence in almost every field of American endeavor, and the pervasive ""anything for a buck"" mentality.  He is such a believer, but he is so angry and disillusioned as well.  The only one out there who seems to understand what's going on and see through all the sheer idiocy that passes for public discourse is Jon Stewart, and he's essentially a comedian.

There was no one out there speaking to him until this movie.  I was astonished, and very moved, that someone cared enough to sit down and talk to my son right where he lived, and tell him what he most needs to hear.  Robert Redford wasn't speaking only to the kid in the movie; he was speaking to this new generation.  To me, the words he spoke were holy and precious, not because of political content, but because they were meant to alight and encourage a sense of purpose and hope that is too easily snuffed out and stunted today, both by the many pretty, mind-numbing distractions available to our youth and the fact that almost no one seems to be acting out of sheer principle.  I had to stop and sob a little at the end of the movie, I was so moved and grateful that someone cared enough to speak to my son and so many others like him to try to ignite the flame of hope again, to realize that if these problems are ever going to be solved, it will only come through a dedication of spirit, commitment of the body, rolling up of the sleeves, getting to work, becoming expert, and going out there to make things better.  The movie was meant to demonstrate that the sacrifices of those who have given their lives in support of our ideals demand no less.

So thank you, Robert Redford and crew.  There are some who are listening and heeding the call.

I will be buying this movie as a high-school graduation present for my son, as he begins his study of political science at college, and I hope he will play it again and again.  Let's all pray that his generation will do better than ours.",1212796800,3,2259,4.388489208633094
3026343,3,B000YDJG0I,"This is probably a great movie to recommend to 17-year-olds in the middle of their high-school Political Science assignments. Prof. Malley (Redford) imparts to his University students all the qualities that any adult with a measure of common sense should possess: not trusting every story that appears in the press, questioning the government, being able to read newspapers between the lines, being able to analyse news rather than digest it. It would be great if all these skills were taught to teenagers in high schools. It is, however, depressing when they are tauhgt by filmmakers to adults (who are, presumably, the target audience here). Worse still, the filmmakers do their job poorly, and the movie sizzles out before it even begins. As the credits begin to roll, you realise that you've just watched a collection of platitudes dressed up as an intellectual discovery. People who are smart enough to understand its supposed message don't need to watch it; the others won't have a clue anyway.

That Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise joined in on this triple take on the War on Terror doesn't make the film any more interesting, it just keeps you wondering when the movie is going to take off. Well, it doesn't, unless your form of entertainment centers around long rants about war and politics. It offers nothing new about the war on terror or its politics that hasn't been said by dozens of other bleeding heart liberals over the last several years.

Meryl Streep comes the closest to actually creating a real character in her role as a TV reporter, but interviewing a miscast and unconvincing Cruise as a US Senator lends no credence to her part in this civics lecture disguised as a film.

Robert Redford, one of the film industry's leading liberal voices, returns to the director's chair for the first time in seven years (2000's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Bagger-Vance/dp/B00003CXI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Bagger Vance</a>&nbsp;was his last) with this 2007 drama written as a three-pronged polemic by Matthew Michael Carnahan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kingdom/dp/B000Y7WGOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kingdom</a>). Carnahan's intentionally didactic screenplay is full of eloquent arguments, but the film's structure points to the movie's chief limitation, which is that the characters are only there to present opposing points of view. The net effect feels more like a civics lesson, especially for two of the three plot threads. The third attempts to translate those political arguments to the actual war zone, but somehow, the night scenes on an isolated hilltop don't make the impact necessary to make the rest of the film resonate.

The first storyline consists of an interview and ensuing debate between charismatic Senator Jasper Irving, a defiantly pro-war Republican hawk on an obvious Presidential track, and Janine Roth, a veteran, Lesley Stahl-like journalist he personally chose to reveal a new offensive the U.S. military is taking in Afghanistan against the Taliban. Their thrust-and-parry conversation is the best part of the movie, but it leads to the weakest part, a meltdown Roth has with her editor over the way the media shapes public opinion on the war without taking any responsibility to end it. The second plot thread involves an early-morning conversation between Professor Stephen Malley, a liberal academic teaching political science, and Todd Hayes, an obviously bright but disaffected student. They uncover Todd's reasons for apathy which stirs Malley to motivate the young slacker toward activism on any scale. The third storyline ties Malley to two former students, Ernest Rodriguez and Arian Finch, best friends both on scholarship, who heed the professor's advice by enlisting. This troubles Malley deeply, and the two are subsequently sent to Afghanistan to be part of the offensive described by Irving in the first storyline.

Tom Cruise is ideally cast as Irving since he has already proven he can convey pending malevolence with surprising conviction. As Roth, Meryl Streep is solid even as the script makes periodic pokes at her character's age. As an actor, Redford appears terrifically engaged as Malley, blurring the line between actor and character to maximum effect. Derek Luke, Michael Pe&ntilde;a and Andrew Garfield are effective in the younger roles. Mark Isham's stirring score is a good match for the gravity of the subject. Even though it's clear that Carnahan's screenplay is designed to raise more questions than it answers, the movie feels strangely incomplete, overly calculated and predictably emphatic despite the earnest intentions. To Redford's credit, the movie doesn't take sides, but it doesn't really finish making a compelling case toward political activism either. His meticulous commentary track is the chief extra on the 2008 DVD, as Redford goes through not only production details but also plot points with precision. There is also a twenty-minute featurette, ""The Making of Lions for Lambs"" which follows the movie from script to casting to production. All the principal actors are featured, as well as Redford and Carnahan. There is a second featurette, ""From Script to Screen"", which seems redundant with the first in specifically covering the script development. There are also a couple trailers for the film and a seven-minute retrospective on the United Artists studio.",1212364800,2,4226,5.926229508196721

It is truly bad, and preachy like almost nothing else.  For most of the movie, I didn't understand Redford's professor character and the scenes in Afghanistan [what you can see of them] are student-movie quality.  Tom Cruise, basing his smile intensive 'performance' on John Edwards, is completely unbelievable.  Meryl Streep, being the pro that she is, tries to bring some intensity to an unplayable character, but only in the single scene with her editor does the movie come to life.

There are numerous continuity gaffes, and how does Tom Cruise's Senator Irving, who claims that he graduated at the top of his class from West Point, have a diploma from Harvard?  Three of us watched this together.  When the movie ended, we collectively yelled, 'That's it?'  Much ado about not much.

3026349,2,B000YDJG0I,"""Lions for Lambs"" joins a raft of recent movies exploring the fallout over the war with Iraq.  The subject matter is timely, and this movie has a few interesting things to say about the war and how Americans view politics.  Unfortunately, the movie is so poorly directed and the characters so stock that it ends up failing to make the intended impact.  The all-star cast includes Tom Cruise as a smug young Republican Senator, Meryl Streep as a smug liberal-leaning reporter, Robert Redford as a smug big-thinking Professor, and newcomer British actor Andrew Garfield as a smug, lazy liberal arts student.  Well you get the point.  The characters could hardly be more caricature-like, which greatly waters down the message of the movie.

Message movies can be powerful in advancing political and sociological ideas, as witnessed by recent successes such as ""Crash"" and ""Babel.""  Unfortunately, whatever substance ""Lions for Lambs"" has is lost in its overly talky, didactic script.  The movie really consists of three intermixed scenes.  Tom Cruise's character gives an exclusive military scoop to Meryl Streep, who plays the most argumentative reporter in history.  After 5 minutes of arguing with her, a real Senator would show her to the door.  In the second scene, Robert Redford's professor tries to motivate one of his slacker students to really, really care.  These two conversations comprise the bulk of the movie along with what seems at first to be unrelated scenes of a military strike in the Middle East.  Gradually, the dots are connected to explain the relevance of the military section of the plot.  This part of the movie is genuinely affecting at time, helped greatly by solid acting by Michael Pena (Crash, Babel) and Derek Luke (Antwone Fisher).  Indeed, this section of the movie should have been expanded; instead, it became the epitome of liberal guilt, sadly undercutting its ultimate effectiveness.

""Lions for Lambs"" is not a terrible movie.  It speeds along quickly and is relatively watchable.  However, what it aims for and what it attains are so disparate as to detract greatly, depending on the individual viewer, from what good things one may take from the movie.  Plus, Redford really doesn't aim high enough for the film to take the title of ""noble failure.""  Excoriating Republicans for being hawkish and taking the press for task for buying into hype aren't exactly going to win you any prizes for originality.",1210896000,6,2444,5.0625
3026350,3,B000YDJG0I,"You know those movies that you watch, and find so compelling you say to people `you HAVE to see this movie...'?  Well, this movie aims for that, but alas merely reaches the heights of `Yeah, it's worth watching...'.
The film revolves around 3 storylines, essentially taking place simultaneously, and in real time, but this structure is not religiously adhered to as there are also some flashbacks.  In Washington, a senior Senator rumored to be a potential Presidential candidate, invites a respected journalist from a major TV news network, to give her an exclusive on the latest tactics being used in Afghanistan.  Meanwhile, that push is shown through the eyes of two soldiers in the Special Forces, as the mission goes wrong and they are stuck behind enemy lines.  The final strand is in a University, as the professor Robert Redford talks to a student full of potential but with more than enough cynicism and apathy to go with it.  He shares his experience with the story of the two Special Forces soldiers, who were students of his and left to `go make a difference'.
It's a movie brimming with talent to be sure, with Robert Redford directing and Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep acting their socks off..  Cruise does give a compellingly convincing portrayal of a senior politician, convinced of his moral high ground but using it to further his career as much or if not more than doing the right thing.  Streep also gives a performance which at times seems just a little too self consciously rounded, when something stripped down to basics would have done just as well.  Her tics and mannerisms would have been better served in a movie which focused on her character.  Redford is.. well, simply Redford.
The script, when we hear the characters debating with each other (which is most of the movie - don't go expecting an action flick whatever you do..) is intelligent and gets across its message clearly enough.  Engagement is needed - apathy is a recipe for disaster, whether it be apathy on an individuals part or on the part of the media.  Clumsy parallels to Vietnam are made.  However, we don't have time to warm to any of the characters, neither are arcs to the characters developed, such that the movie ultimately feels like a lecture - something that a documentary could have done as well - or even better, using actual facts instead of drama.
Worth watching for some good performances and literate script, but should have been much more.  How did such interesting talent combine to make such a mediocre product - is making a statement on war so much at odds with good film-making these days?",1210723200,,2603,4.757777777777778

3026354,5,B000YDJG0I,"This is the kind of film which is carried by its actors, who are each tonally perfect. Putting aside their possible salaries, it is also one of the cheapest to produce you can imagine (except perhaps for the battle set). Even if it were made more cheaply, it is hard to imagine that its drama would have suffered.

The typical Hollywood line is ""If you want to send a message, call Western Union."" And this is nothing if not a message film. But that hardly detracts from its mounting excitement, as the three diverse storylines begin to come together. It's not just about a message you see. It's about a lost message. It's like the parable of the mustard seed, which can fall on stony or on fertile ground, or the message for ears if you have them.

And in a way, it's about Redford's own arc of creativity with getting out a message, from Three Days of the Condor to All the President's Men to The Way We Were.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Days-of-the-Condor/dp/6305511055/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Days of the Condor</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-the-President-s-Men-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000CEXEWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All the President's Men (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Way-We-Were-Special-Edition/dp/B00001W9G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Way We Were (Special Edition)</a>. This one is about the corrupted message, passed by a messenger (Streep) who has sold out to the tabloid magnates.  In the previous works, most notably All the President's Men, you got the feel that it was about knowing the truth and having it set you free. But this is more about incuriosity about the truth, and how much easier it is to ignore it and enjoy your own little playpen.

Professor Malley (Redford) plays a professor at the what could be UCLA, but with the tuition stated, more likely USC. He has a meeting with a non-performing student, a frat boy. There is an immediate rapport between them and you can well believe in the Redford's character having once been at a similar place in his young life, albeit threatened in those days by the Vietnam draft. Malley once had two other students, who are now in Afghanistan. They were more hard-working, coming as they did from LA ghettos where blacks and Hispanics experience far more violence than the white frat boy could imagine. While the frat boy is, for the moment, free to live his own life, the former students are currently the ""lions for lambs"", the playthings of fate.

That fate is foreshadowed by the ambitions of a senator hoping to run for president, Tom Cruise, who believes that he can provide a way to victory in the place which has never been conquerable from Alexander the Great to the Soviet Union, and which is now contested between warlords, the Taliban and the US and allies. Whatever happens, the former students of Professor Malley, are there and very much in harm's way. Cruise does not break a sweat as he implements the policy of the executive branch, between cell phone calls and his interview with formerly distinguished journalist Meryl Streep (now a person reduced to a narrow crawl space while Spears and Fetterline command the evening news and a bleached blond with a rack holds court). You have the feeling that Streep is in hell (even her thermostat at the studio is set too high for comfort). She rode a wave once of enthusiasm for policies she never took the time to understand. It was easer to sell them than to confront their inventors with questions. Having become a seller, it is impossible now to become a truth-seeker.

In the end, it is about the generation which slumbers, whether lions or lambs. It is about their lulling by all the cunning devices of the media, while their fates will one day, you can imagine, be held in the well-manicured hands of French-cuffed Cruise, their future absolute monarch. He is an expert at military intelligence, he says, having graduated first in his class at West Point. But he has never seen combat.

His future minions have many toys they have not yet taken from the upper shelf (Streep), but at a word, they will be able to do so, if his party leader's latest cock-up can be spun using the heroism of Malley's former students as a recruiting tool.

If there is a Deep Throat in this story, it is Streep, whose crawl space should be stretched to fill the whole screen, expelling the tacky tabloid amusement for what she really knows, and when she knew it. But until the customers quit drugging on the fluff, that cannot happen. Anyway, she's 57, and she has fatrolls rather than a rack. Will the frat boys watch?",1210377600,5,4724,5.118028534370946

It is a fictitious conversation, where the screenwriter can manipulate the conversation in any way he wants (as it is with all screenplays).  The dialogue in this movie is carefully crafted and controlled for political purposes.  It is propaganda.  Now, both sides of an issue have propaganda.  Propaganda is not bad.  But this movie supposes to speak for both sides of an issue, when in reality it speaks only for one.  The liberal agenda is just as apparent when Irving is speaking as it is when Roth is speaking.

For what reason are the lambs doing this? Only (ONLY!) for their own political image. By no means do these politicians actually care about the safety of their country...only about what will get them elected next time.

So who are the heroes in this film? The soldiers and...the media. As director Robert Redford tells it; the media take the twisted lies and propaganda that the right-wing politicians are spewing and straighten it out to the stories that we read in the paper. Alright, great.

Meryl Streep plays the reporter, who was one of the people who fell prey to the ""terrible lies"" that followed the 9/11 terrorist attacks regarding who was responsible. She is interviewing Tom Cruise, a politician who the audience is obviously supposed to dislike.

Here's the problem(s).

This is a propoganda piece! Now, propoganda isn't neccasarily bad, but Streep's climatic rant toward the end of the film makes a valid point against the film itself. When questioned why she doesn't want to print the story given by Cruise's character, Streep says that ""all he gave was propoganda."" In other words, she argued that she wouldn't be printing NEWS, she would be printing a piece of biased propoganda. That is essentially what this movie is.

This is not a debate for a certain view...it is mere propoganda masquerading as a provocotive look at the debate behind the Iraq War. When you can make your opponent say whatever you want so that you can come up with some clever retort, it isn't exatly valid debate.

Bottom line; Do not be fooled...this is Redford's bitter views spun into an angering propoganda piece. The very politicians he condemns may be more like him than he thinks...",1209859200,17,1840,4.881410256410256

There are three distinct storylines going on, all taking place over a period of an hour in different regions of the world.  In California, Robert Redford is a political science professor debating an apathetic student about political activism during the former's office hours.  There is no plot, just a bunch of back-and-forth arguing.  Meanwhile, two of Redford's former students - who actually followed his call to participate, though not in the way he intended - are now Special Forces soldiers trapped on a mountaintop in Afghanistan after a mission went wrong.  This is the only storyline that is minimally interesting, probably because it is the only one with any real action in it.

The third storyline involves a Republican senator played by Tom Cruise giving an interview to reporter Meryl Streep.  The purpose of their meeting is to unveil the purpose of the Afghanistan mission, which Cruise does not yet know has gone wrong.  The interview, however, turns into a debate about the United States's efforts in the Middle East, and it is grating to watch.  The attempt to provide a semblance of balance fails:  Cruise's pro-war stance is so filled with cliched lines - and he comes off too glib - that he is utterly unbelievable.  Streep isn't much better on her side.

From a political standpoint, I actually agree with a lot of what this movie says, but it does it so poorly that it undermines its own cause.  I often say I can enjoy a good book or movie even if I disagree with its politics, as long as it's done well; similarly, I can hate a book or movie that I agree with if it's done bad, as this one is.  Whether you are for or against the Iraq war, this movie should be avoided.",1209254400,30,2100,4.6811989100817435
3026363,1,B000YDJG0I,"This movie had a lot of potential, it had a really good premise and could have been a really good movie but it failed miserably.

The #1 problem with this movie was that the producer/director did not do their homework. By that, I mean ALL the military aspects of this movie were laughable (I literally laughed where inappropriate). I won't point out all the mistakes, I'm not someone who does that. I don't want to spoil anything so just know when you're watching, that two ""American"" soldiers, especially Army Special Forces would NEVER do what these two do at the end, its insulting for those of us who are over here fighting right now that people will believe that.

The other BIG problem with this movie was the script, not the story or even the screenplay but the dialogue itself. Watching this was like sitting through a liberal Political Science lecture.  The movie was almost painful to sit through, and at just over 90 minutes thats really saying something.  Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep are two of the best actors alive and in this movie, I could tell they were acting. I didn't believe he was a senator and I didn't believe she was a reporter. Cruise and Streep did their best with the script and the direction they were given, but all in all this movie was just BAD.

If you're looking for a GOOD movie about Afghanistan and why we're still here, watch ""Charlie Wilson's War"" It blows this movie out of the water.",1209254400,14,1424,4.546875
3026364,3,B000YDJG0I,"For the actual cinematic qualities, see Roland E. Zwick's excellent review.  Short version:  it doesn't work all that well, because it is dry and wooden.

OK, so the medium is lacking.  What about the message?

Well, you get to review bad war leadership decisions from the Bush administration.  Who knew?

In the Streep/Cruise thread, Cruise very much ends up being the straw man, but gets to put his case across very eloquently.  Merryl Streep often challenges him, but without pressing her arguments (hint: she's doing it for the audience).  When she does really object, it is not with him, but rather with her news manager.  I guess a central point Cruise makes would be hard to answer:  what would exactly happens if the US cuts and runs now?

And that's the whole weakness on the foreign policy side:  it criticizes but doesn't manage to even try to articulate an answer.  Or indeed even ask novel and important questions, as it doesn't rise much above canned, though valid, criticism.

Where it does come up with its own ideas, through Redford's character, it proposes a woolly, likely useless agenda about an in-USA-Peace-Corps that has absolutely nothing to do with Afghanistan/Iraq.  And it laments the supposed stupidity, ignorance and apathy of the voters.  Original that.  And with just a whiff of elitism.

In the end, the best thing about the movie is its title.  It refers to WWI German soldiers admiring the doomed courage of British soldiers at the Battle of the Somme, while they were lead by an incompetent top leadership.  That pretty much summarizes Iraq and Afghanistan 6 years on, though the failures are much less at the military than at the political level.

I applaud Robert Redford for trying to wake folks up, but this ain't 'Apocalypse Now', 'Deer Hunter' or even 'Three Kings' in terms of cinema quality or mass appeal.  As a result, its audience and its effects will be limited.",1209168000,,1909,4.842105263157895
3026365,3,B000YDJG0I,"I enjoyed my High School Goverment class with eyes that made it fun,so,here me out...

""Lions for Lambs"" does have very strong potential-that very strong potential standing on top of the importance that it covers. It is a film dealing with all of the issues of our current Goverment. Take a look at how ""Lions for Lambs"" deals with the Iraq war...and the flak that both senators and journalists deal with...and you can find it all here. A good education,right?

The answer to that question is right:halfway right. With ""Lions for Lambs"",Robert Redford(the first person to knock the Oscar out of Martin Scorsese's hands,I might add)does a very good job at taking three seperate lives(a Senator,a TV journalist,and a professor)and blending them all into one(Redford's character is just a connection to the characters of Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep-you'll see the connection and what I mean). What these three characters deal with and how they get entangled in what is blamed on the Government and the Bush administration-does show the world we live in today(more,though,if you are against the war in Iraq-this is not a film for Iraq war supporters). Robert Redford does open viewers' eyes more a little bit to the career of a senator and a journalist in this current world. That,right there,is very positive and gives ""Lions for Lambs"" a strong,metal ground to stand on.

The main problem,though,is that ""Lions for Lambs""(aside from what I already mentioned)is nothing about the Gov. we don't know already. The stuff that doesn't open our eyes and make us understand is what has been running in the headlines. It's the basis of the majority of ""Lions for Lambs"". And,unfortunately,""Lions for Lambs"" does become slow and boring in getting its required expression out not too long after the film has settled in(and that's most of the film). Had LFL been kept at its required pace(Robert Redford and Meryl Streep themselves claimed that they had several problems on the set with Tom Cruise that caused this damage)and been kept at a good and even balance,the news of today might have a little more life summarized better. Remember that ten to twenty years from now,when ""Lions for Lambs"" will be the past headlines of a very important and controverisal time in history(with a lot of resemblance to Vietnam,as we already know).

Worth a look,and don't ignore it because of Tom Cruise-but be prepared of the dominating detours that are too be found here.",1208476800,,2447,4.9755501222493885

Except for the little bit of action when the soldiers in Iraq are faced with a huge crisis, the rest is pretty much talk, talk and talk all the way to the end.

The movie is seperated in 3 different scenarios, which in reality, are all part of the same situation... a few specific soldiers dealing with war in Iraq.

There are better movies out there concerning this issue with a more intelligent and entertaining script. You can easily skip this one.",1208217600,2,586,4.36697247706422
3026367,5,B000YDJG0I,"Based on the reviews thus far, the following is clear:

If you are still a Republican after all that has happened, then this movie won't change your mind... it'll just make you mad.  Check out numbersusa, and do something constructive with your time (honestly, that's a more appropriate place to vent your frustration).  Save us your brash negative review.

If you are looking for SAS entertainment, and want to avoid a mental challenge, then that's sad, but this movie is not your cup-of-tea.

If you are anti-intellectual (or the new buzz-phrase: anti-""elitist"") and/or cynical to the point where you abhor any type of strong opinion on controversial matters, then your mind will filter out the meaning, and you will only hear garbled chatter.  That's really a shame, because this movie is largely about--and directed at--YOU.  The movie's modality is not in tune with your way of thinking, so chances are very high that you will not like it.

If you are under about 15 years old (less for girls), then this movie is probably too weighty for you.  If you still think it's cool to be smart, and you pride your intellect, then you might give it a try.

All other personality types should see this movie, and try hard to stick with it, because it's important that you ""get it.""  The Socratic Method is at work here, so it may take a while to digest.  The movie will challenge your intellect, and there is no doubt that it is politically polarizing.  The movie is largely a dialog from multiple points of view, so you won't agree with everything... the important thing is that you understand the movie in its totality.

It's a shame that many people seek to exclude themselves--and others--from civil discourse about the issues presented by writing such brash reviews.  I'm sure thousands of potential viewers are being scared away by this insidious tactic.  Robert Redford has been a champion of the little guy ever since The Milagro Beanfield War.  He is at his most poignant here in L4L.  Unless you are a complete ditto-head, this movie deserves your support [""ambivalence only helps the oppressor""].  It is part of a monumentally important civil discourse that is sorely needed at this time and place in history.",1208131200,4,2215,4.8121693121693125

3026369,2,B000YDJG0I,"Barely a 2 and I won't be buying it.  OK, where do I start?  First and foremost, I believe that this movie gave very little technical realism to the military side of the equation.  Once again, we're portrayed as macho idiots (or lambs) that are saluting smartly and doing the bidding of senseless Republican war-mongers who do ""whatever it takes.""  The technical aspects of the military mission were laughable.  Anyone that falls or jumps out of a helicopter 100 feet above mountainous terrain is going to DIE.  Yet, one of our college heroes falls out and the other jumps out so that ""no man is left behind"" and they survive the fall into a snow bank on a flat part of the mountain pass.  Next, Hollywood shows us that we can see our good guys with the bad guy ""Talies"" approaching via satellite imagery through a blinding snow storm at night...right.  So, we watch our intrepid heroes fight off some of the advance of some 20-30 enemy while having little or no terrain as cover.  Why are our heroes not killed outright?....We are told that the Taliban want to take them alive.  OK, maybe plausible, but unlikely.  Next, our A-10 support arrives and bombs the crap out of the FLOT (forward line of troops) at least two or three times.  Initially our heroes hope that all have been vanquished, but then suffer further small arms fire from the dark only yards away.  What do they decide?  Do they decide to try to hold on for what everyone knows will be the rescue attempt?  NOOOOOO.  Damn it.  They stand up and go out in a suicide blaze of fire because they believe all is lost.  CRAP!  Seconds later the remaining Taliban are exterminated in the final A-10 pass and the rescue helicopter only a couple of minutes away.  I was so angry I could spit.  The rest of the movie is what you would expect from Robert Redford, another lecture on his view of American politics and right wing wrongs.  Where do these people get their military technical consultation, the Salvation Army?",1208131200,9,1977,4.572649572649572
3026370,4,B000YDJG0I,"Another reviewer at Amazon notes 'it's about getting off your butt', while another here notes 'this isn't for short attention span viewers', and yet... I'm not sure either of those points are quite right about this film.

This film is a complex tale with writing that seems to be from the same school as say The West Wing, or Sports Night, or the later Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.  No, this wasn't an Aaron Sorkin tale, but it seems that way, and if you watch the extras and listen to the writer's own words, and those of the actors and actresses that brought those words to life, you see that style very clearly (if you didn't already pick up on it).  Given what the writer seemed to be going for, and what the actors and actresses (and director Robert Redford), they all seem to have delivered, but then the question becomes what have they really delivered?

This isn't an anti-war picture, but at the same time it is most certainly not a film that glorifies war or places the military on a pedestal.  Far from it, the military and political leadership rightfully catches blame for the mishandling of the war in Afghanistan.  We're 'treated to' seeing the results of the poor leadership, poor intelligence, and poor planning as it plays out over roughly one third of this film in the form of two special forces soldiers on a mission gone bad.

While those events are unfolding 'in real time', we're also looking in at an interview (also occuring in real time) between an aging reporter (played by Meryl Streep) and a young 'hot shot' politician (played by Tom Cruise).  The dialog and banter between Streep and Cruise is crisp and quick, though there isn't the talking over other players that happens quite frequently in the Aaron Sorkin products noted above.  As the interview unfolds, and then is looked at later when Streep goes back to the offices of her big media/entertainment company employer, we learn that Streep wasn't happy with the answers she got from Cruise.  She is placed in a bit of a dilemma as her bosses presses her to take the story she was given and run with it while she feels much less inclined to actually run the story.

Finally, while those events have been unfolding in real time, we get the last of events that are also unfolding in a real time as the political science professor played by Robert Redford is having an early morning meeting with an apparent slacker student who holds a lot of promise but just can't seem to engage himself in Redford's classes any more.

The film moves back and forth between events in Afghanistan, to the Congressman's office in D.C., to the University in California and as we see flashbacks of past events in the professor's class we find that we are seeing a pair of individuals there who are now heavily involved in events in Afghanistan.

What is the message of the film?  Is there even one particular message?  Certainly that 'get off your butt and get involved' message is there, but that isn't the only message and if it was just that message trying to come through in this film there are other films that would seem to do a much better job of passing along that message (see Pay It Forward as an example).

Perhaps the message is that politicians are idiots?  Maybe, but again other films would seem to do a better job at telling and showing us that to be the case.

Maybe the message is that the news media that have been there and done that are smarter than everyone else and know what will and won't work as they see through the semantics and re-invention of older military strategies that are being brought up by the hot-shot politicians and the military brass.

After the fact, the lack of the single message and the complexity of the film may be what hurts the film the most, or at least hurts the film with most potential viewers.  While I rated the film at 4 stars in my review, it is more in the 3-1/2 star range for me (curse you for not allowing 1/2 star ratings Amazon.com!), and I can certainly see where it would be a 2 star (or worse) snooze fest for many or even a 5 star masterpiece for others.  I wish it was a bit easier to consume, but then again do people really want to be beat over the head with the messages and morals from the writers/directors/actors?

3026372,5,B000YDJG0I,"I recently finished my second degree. I am in the military. I watch the ""news"" and even care about politics a bit. A lot of people will not 'get' this movie (clearly, when reading some of the other reviews).

It wasn't supposed to be another Hollywood entertainment piece without substance. And it is not preaching anything. What Robert Redford does do here, is point out the apathy and ignorance of many Americans who chose to takes the path of least resistance in life, while others fight around the world for what they believe in. While they continue to die, we are microwaving our TV dinners at home. (THINK about it).

In addition, the film highlights current political agendas, corporate cultures and consumerism in the news rooms, where political propagandas are transferred from politicians to TV without commentary or (valuable) discussion. (Fox news is not valuable discussion, in case you didn't know. Neither is the daily show by the way!).

The ""news"" as it stands today, is really a part of the entertainment industry, rather than researched perspective and political engagement. Dead soldiers in Iraq are talked about in the same segment as Anna Nicole Smith's baby and Paris Hilton's dog. Americans in particular (ok, not ALL of them for you nitpickers out there), have a 2 minute attention span when it comes to serious news, so the news agencies have to package it into an entertainment format. If you're offended now, you're probably one of them...

The film touches on other aspects of current happenings, like America's standing in the world and our place within America. This is an excellent film that many people will chose to overlook or undersell, because it is hard to admit that the criticism of the film is directed to the viewer, you.

I won't go into military operation inaccuracies, but they are there, and there's plenty for even the casual observer to notice.
I gave this movie two stars, because deep beneath the thunderous anti-war drums, behind the rosy red lens from which Hollywood (Robert Redford in particular) is able to understand military planning and global strategy with a deftness envied by all, and buried beneath a pile of propaganda that would make the most skilled spin doctor proud, is a singular lesson which makes some of this redeemable.

Each time, my response is the same -- I am back in the late 60s marching and leafletting and doing everything I can to end the stupid war this country stumbled into. I am energized and purposeful and working for something I believed was important. And, ultimately, I am thrilled when my actions and those of millions of others, ended that war.
The current war is just one in a series of stupid mistakes. Mistakes that keep getting made because we the people don't make OUR views known. We don't make them known in the voting booths nor by continued vigilance. And so we get what we get -- we get smarmy politicians with no sense of the past who just want to make a name for themselves no matter how many people may get hurt; we get journalists who were so traumatized by 9/11 that they were not able to be our watchdogs and warn us when bad decisions were made; we get teachers and professors who are saddened by rather than inspired by their students; and we get young people who have watched us all turn to TV as a panacea instead of turning off the TV and getting involved.
Seemed to me very clear that the Iraq non-war was a place to set this movie, rather then the point of it.

3026387,4,B000YDJG0I,"LIONS FOR LAMBS as a movie has the courage to do just what the message of the film attempts to do: encourage the American public to stop being so apathetic about our position in the global community.  The dramatization of three points of view about the Middle East conflicts (it not only takes on the Iraq debacle, but adds the Afghanistan and Iran problems as well) could, in lesser hands than Robert Redford's direction of Matthew Michael Carnahan's script, be a preachy bore.  But while the 'action' of the film may not grab the viewer, the afterburn of the message will haunt the thinking person.

Three scenarios interweave (at times a bit bumpy in the editing, and at times a bit distracting): adamantly pro-war Republican Senator Irving (Tom Cruise) is interviewed by veteran 'thinking' journalist Janine Roth (Meryl Streep) and each defends/attacks the current strategy of the war in Iraq (Irving is taking calls about the latest 'expansion' into Afghanistan); Professor Malley (Robert Redford) tries to resurrect a sense of involvement in a student Todd Hayes (Andrew Garfield) once bright but now sinking into the apathy of living the good life; ex-students of Professor Malley - Arian Finch (Derek Luke) and Ernesto Rodriguez (Michael Pea) - have committed to the idea of acting for change and have ended up being dropped in Afghanistan in the very 'new' war Senator Irving is addressing.  By stirring these three approaches to the manner in which the public is  currently addressing the war in Iraq in a concurrent conversation, the film involves the viewer in the crossfire of apathy and misinformation that come from failed education, faulty governmental intervention and the media sellout to get ratings.  It is not a pretty picture, but then our current state of affairs is not one of which we can be proud.

There are no answers here, just harsh realities and questions as to why  we can remain so passive as a nation involved in the lowest state of global respect ever known. The film has flaws, but if the viewer can digest the information illustrated by some very fine acting, perhaps there may be a chance for a wake-up call.

3026388,4,B000YDJG0I,"What could have been wasn't.

This movie had the potential to be one of the greatest movies, ever.

Such an intelligent script (so, so rare these days), high powered cast, perceptive, meaningful conjecture. Even, Shakespearean.

However...

Tom Cruise: He wasn't so much smarmy (previous review) as he was slick... his smile a little too broad and beautiful, his eyes a little too bright. The part demanded an ageless jadedness, downplayed frustration, sublimated passion oozing from the edges of world weary Congressional soullessness.

He deserves credit for being able to deliver such long winded passages in a convincing, conversational style. There needed to be more closeups, more subtle facial emotion from him. Something roiling beneath.

Smart Student: The actor who portrayed the bright but cynical, blas&eacute; student was terribly miscast. He was unable to plumb the true wealth inherent within this character.

His part was crucial, diametrically oppositional to the core premises of this movie. It demanded a student-type whom you might scoff, deride, ridicule at first; but, in the end, brings you to sympathetic understanding. This part had the power to mesmerize, captivate, motivate.

But, no. Didn't do.

It was as if everyone was a bit tired.

Meryl Streep: She didn't seem to have her full, amazing heart enmeshed in her part as she usually does. Even a bit insipid, disinterested, at times. Here is a newswoman who has been able to maintain a passion for honesty. A special newswriter, indeed. Meryl could have taken this to the nth.

Redford: He was convincing as an ivory towered ennui'd prof who skims the surface of, rather than engages, life.

The two military students: These two actors started off bland, unlikeable. However... they blossomed. In fact, they eventually grew to magnificent stature. They so ably were able their character's perspectives on War, on true nobility of spirit.

They are the true stars, these relative unknowns. They captured the heart.

This movie is good enough to watch over and over, so it is a buy.

But, some people today might not have the staying power to stick through it, having become used to flash, pop and sizzle of small meaningless sound bites that seem to prevail.

3026389,5,B000YDJG0I,"Let's sum this movie up because that is what a review is for correct?

Very well done.

This movie was made with several intentions in mind, unfortunately the general public is all too quick to pick a side and they miss the point of the film entirely.

You have all aspects of politicians in this movie you have the senator (Tom Cruise) GOP baby moving up in the ranks, trying to make his mark.  You have the Liberal Professor (Redford) and you have the voice to the sheep of the country the media (Streep.)

For those of you that stated it is one sided I don't know how many more sides you need because that is what the War is about.  Everyone is fed exactly what they need to eat, nothing more, nothing less it is up to the individual to determine if they like the taste.

This was an excellent movie about how America is losing its place in the world concerning itself with the Middle East.  The people in that region will never change.  They have been that way for thousands of years and America is not special.  We will lose the war because they will not quit and we are so arrogant we can't pick up a History book and realize that this is the way it is and that is it.

I am a soldier and I can tell you this because my friends have died there, are serving there and I support the War Effort as well in Europe taking care of the Men and Women that get sent to the slaughter by our Politicians and Government that don't give a damn about their people.  When this is over do you really think that the families of the 4,000 soldiers will get this overwhelming sigh ""well my child's life was sacrificed for something and I am glad they laid down their life....""  C'mon!?

The movie made a great statement at the end with the complete apathy of the college student because that sums it up, people would rather watch a meaningless melodrama then care about what is happening in the world because everyone has become so desensitized to everything.

3026390,1,B000YDJG0I,"I should have known better given that the film was directed by Redford, but I decided to give it a shot.  I suppose at the end of the day, Redford did not ""disappoint"" as he gave what should expect from him: good acting and left-wing lectures.  It would have been nice if the film makers actually put in a little more plot and action to help the non-Daily Kos-reading audience members wash down the rhetoric (kind of how a spoon full of sugar makes the medicine go down), but I suppose the choir will be happy.

Here's what the movie's messages boil down to: Bush and the GOP are ""iredeemable,"" dumb, uncaring about the soldiers because they never faught in the infantry (although serving in infantry combat was a prerequisite to compassion for the soldiers, one wonders where the movie maker's supposed compassion comes from), and liars.  You can't believe anything the government says about the War on Terror, so instead, you should take a cynical attitude that everything is a lie, or you should spin your own conspiracy theories about the true intentions of the government, even in the absence of any evidence (as the Meryl Streep reporter character wants to do).  The soldiers who fight are laudable, but they're really dieing for a bunch of lies.  Iraq and Afganistan are just two more Vietnams that we should pull out from (because the War on Terror again, is just a powergrab by the GOP).  Finally, it's the public's apathy that is really at fault for the damage to our country because we should have known that Bush et al were just a bunch of evil, opportunistic, warmongerers.

The acting is really the only positive of this movie.  Redford, Streep, Cruise, and the guys who play the trapped soldiers all do good jobs.  I have to think that Cruise's performance is especially noteworthy, as he must have wanted to throw up in his mouth while playing a hawkish Republican Senator.",1207440000,17,1889,4.696969696969697
3026391,2,B000YDJG0I,"I started out watching this movie expecting to hate it. I'd heard all about how it was a one sided, liberal view of the ongoing war in the Middle East. Knowing Robert Redford's politics I expected nothing less. But then it pulled me in. That is until it summed up towards the end.

The movie has three converging stories that all meld into one. The first involves charismatic politician Senator Jasper Irving (Tom Cruise) who is giving a one on one interview with journalist Janine Roth (Meryl Streep). The interview is an attempt to get the press to work with Irving who is behind a new push in Afghanistan. While slick, Irving has to be the bad guy because we see news headlines about how the GOP is losing popularity (though our current congress is at an all time low in popularity and not run by the GOP) and pictures of him with everyone from President Bush to Condeleza Rice.

The second story revolves around a college student (Andrew Garfield) and his political science teacher (Redford). Redford sees great potential in this student who has a come what may attitude towards life. To convince him of his potential, Redford tells him the story of two other students, our third story.

The other two students are Ernest Rodriguez (Michael Pena) and Arian Finch (Derek Luke), a Mexican American and black American, who got where they were in school via scholarships. They have chosen to join the armed forces to take a stand and try and change things from the inside. Both are involved in this new push and have been stranded behind enemy lines in Afghanistan.

Each of these stories revolves around one simple idea. That the war in the Middle East is wrong and has been wrong and always will be wrong. Granted it never says this statement out loud, but that IS what the central story is about.

It's also about the choices we make and how they affect more than ourselves. Choices to stand for what we believe, to sit back and watch the world go by, to enhance an already volatile situation or to offer up a truth spun to us rather than seek the reality behind the story. Unfortunately for this film, it tries to represent each side of the story using only one.

An intellectual discussion on the topic would find merit in both sides because in truth it exists. But this movie espouses to do so while propagandizing only one. Each point of view made is done so with nothing more than the same rhetoric used over and over again to make a case. An example: the current war we find ourselves in is NOT Vietnam and never will be no matter how hard people want to draw comparisons. No two wars are alike no matter how many people want them to be. But this movie falls back on that comparison on more than one occasion.

The film is well made, don't get me wrong. It looks tremendous. The acting is top notch (with the exception of Streep who never convinced me of her character). It feels like a great Hollywood movie. I began by enjoying it but ended feeling like I had heard this same story over and over again and always from someone unwilling to look at both sides of an issue. And that being what was trying to be told here made it a failure in so many ways.

If you buy into the rhetoric, you'll love this movie. If you don't, it will make you angry. And if you can at least, honestly, go into with an open mind, you'll walk away thinking perhaps they need more open minded people to make both sides heard.  This movie died at the box office. It's easy to see why.",1207440000,5,3470,4.434850863422292

3026394,3,B000YDJG0I,"This is not a Tom Cruise movie, nor is it a Meryl Streep movie and it's barely a Robert Redford movie. Frankly, Lions for Lambs is barely a ""movie"" at all and if you wish to enjoy it you mustn't think of it as such, let alone a blockbuster movie. L4L is best savoured as a pseudo-documentary, not quite like Inconvenient Truth, though not that far away either.

In fact, the film could really be named Inconvenient Talk or Inconvenient Topics, as it's really about, well, talking about tough topics with no clear consensus view - in politics, in education, in media about the role of America and Americans in the war on terror, in the classroom, in public knowledge, in government, as minorities, as the privileged and so on.

You've got Robert Redford, a professor trying to convince possibly his brightest student that there's more to life than just earning degrees and growing rich. His take on crises like the Iraqi war, possibly echoing Redford's personal view, is that the younger generation can't sit back and blame the hopeless politicians. The people of America have got to do something, although two other students of his take the view to (what he views as) an extreme position by actualling signing up to fight.

These two students - a Puerto Rican and Negro - also form the other key segment of the show, a snow-battle in the mountains of Afghanistan resulting from a very poorly planned US military op. This fiasco was in turn the brainchild of Senator Jasper Irving, played with boyish gusto by Tom Cruise, the poster child of American Republican politics who says all the right things and ducks most of the tough questions, and does both with a huge grin. Irving invites Meryl Streep's character, a journalist, to do an exclusive on the new military strategy and in the process engages in a tense debate on the failures and futures of American foreign policy in the context of the war on terror.

L4L is all about the arguments. Back forth back forth - it's one big plurivocal textbook played out in motion picturesque.

Should Americans be indifferent, should they apologise, should they curse the politicians (those who never say anything but never stop talking, and who keep repeating that, ""I am NOT running for President"") and ignore them, or should they take an active role which may involve sacrificing 'the good life' (of good colleges, high salaries and big walls)?

Should the United States pull its troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan and risk ""a shattered Iraq, a hopeless Afghanistan and a nuclear Iran""? Or should America continue to put their boys in the firing line, up the tempo and seek to annihilate the rebel forces and the 'Tali' (ban - get it?) once and for all? Are good and brave Americans who enlist for military action being stupid and throwing their futures away, like lions led by lambs? Or would it be better to seek alternative routes of engagement, until one is drafted into the army?

Can one disagree with another's patriotic actions whilst revering the other's reasons for them? (Can, in fact, motives and actions be so neatly separated?)

So you have professors, wise monkeys, counselling young lions not to be led to the slaughter by lambs like the Senators, themselves challenged by elephant-journalists with large memories - whilst the entire jungle is in crisis. Welcome to the circus of life. There are animals everywhere and no one's really sure what's happening, but everyone's hoping there'll be a happy ending. Before we all tear each other apart, limb from bloody limb.

A unique movie on political conversations, if ever one was made. Too bad Redford didn't get Cruise to get out of his office. That may have saved it from becoming a 'Ticking Tom Bomb'? As it stands, some scenes should serve well as an intro to a course or seminar of Political Science. Because too bad, no, I don't think your average movie-goer is going to want to spend a few good weekend hours or a tired post-work evening seeing movie-stars (albeit very famous ones) sit and talk.",1206748800,6,4012,4.769452449567724
3026395,4,B000YDJG0I,"Lions for Lambs was released to relatively disappointing results, under performing both critically and financially. In the end, it would make some money, more overseas than in America, but the fledgling United Artists had to be disappointed. It's too bad, if you ask me, that the film was so passed by. It's a relatively slowly paced, but the film has a real meaning to it. Some declared it to be preachy and generic, a liberal rant. But I strongly disagree. It's a much more fair meditation than it was portrayed, I went to theatre with extremely conservative friends, for example, and they were not offended.

The film follows three different stories, a moral conversation between a professor (Robert Redford) and his student, an 'information session' of sorts between a Senator (Tom Cruise) and a reporter (Meryl Streep), and two soldiers under fire in Afghanistan (Derek Luke and Crash's Michael Pena). The film moves in real time, creating a powerful impact, while Cruise and Meryl debate, the two men near death. The talk between Redford and the college boy feels real, and is thoughtful, a worthy reflection on our world today. The film attempted to portray and shed light on the world and decisions which our youth is facing, the dangers and trials awaiting them, and was more or less panned by our hypocritical media as a romantic and preachy endeavor.  It saddens me that a piece that would once have been regarded as noble is now thought of as foolish, so far have we fallen.

That of course, is my ideological ramblings. If you're a fan of any of the actors involved, this film truly is a must see, everyone involved is at the top of their game, particularly Tom Cruise. He's on fire as a politician with a goal. Also, as I've said, even looking past the near perfect performances, this film really does have its merits, it's a thoughtful piece.",1206662400,3,1857,4.760869565217392

3026407,5,B000YDJG0I,"This work of Robert Redford is by far, his most ambitious, thoughtful and incisive project, if we take a look about all his previous achievements.

This smart script presents us the different perspectives around a sensible issue about the brutal and devastating conflict that surrounds us a good part of reflections.

Four scenarios, four positions, four defined points of view; the brain, represented by the Senator Irving (Tom Cruise) firmly convinced about this new strategy must prevail and sustained whatever it takes , he represents the rational wing, the wide sector of the pragmatism and decision makings sit on a desk in a comfortable office.

On the other side of the trench, we have to a sensitive, clever and worried journalist (Meryl Streep) who is required by him to make an interview, that works out as an ethical confrontation between the plans and the practical results along all these years; smart strategies of war and hard to die convictions that are loomed in order to preserve the dignity and the proud of the Western hemisphere against the inquisitive responses and arguments exposed by the journalist.

The nerve is symbolized by an idealistic professor (Robert Redford) against his counterpart , his mirror image, the opinion of a brilliant but still immature teenager (Andrew Gardfield) who refuses and criticizes even the meaning of his role in the world. In retrospective style we will witness two students assuming a public posture in a clever exposition of ideas and ideals, though they have chosen to enlist in the Army.

The muscle is represented by the Army, where ironically these young citizens collide, to experience in live flesh the horror of a strategic default, a non foreseen incident or an undesirable collateral damage, when they fall on enemy territory in the heights of a snowy mountain in Afghanistan.

You should see this movie with first rate attention, because its narrative time overcomes by far, its physical time; there's abundant food for thought all the way through, despite of the fact the narrative structure is based on ""Babel"".

3026408,4,B000YDJG0I,"Robert Redford, Tom Cruise, and Meryl Streep have taken every controversial topic of the current war and condensed them into an engrossing, moving, provocative, hour-and-twenty-minute debate movie.

The film takes place over an hour of time, of three separate, yet loosely related, storylines. They are as follows: The first is an ambitious senator (played by Tom Cruise), who has his eye on presidential candidacy, and has called in a famous news reporter (Meryl Streep) to giver her a story for the press about a new strategy he has come up with to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan. He hopes that its success will boost this career and he spends his hour of the movie attempting to explain the facts in a very safe, favorable context to the reporter.

The second story is two marines who are part of the ""new"" strategy being put into operation as the Senator discusses it. The third story is a Californian college professor (played by Robert Redford) who is meeting with one of his students who has missed one-too-many classes. He is the same professor who taught the two marines.

All three storylines are blended together with a seamless, effective simplicity. By having all three happening in the same hour made it effective and almost unsettling as you see the marines fighting in the snowing night, and then come back to the bright, spotless, office of the senator sitting discussing the very strategy being fought. It made me realize how much is constantly happening in simultaneous motion. I cannot even imagine how much has happened as I write this review.

As I said, a myriad of controversial topics are brought up but no real answer offered, but that is how it is effective. It brings up the topics and leaves you thinking about it long afterward without the feeling like you were force-fed one opinion. Two strong points that make the film so good are sharp, to-the-point script and the trio of big-name stars who all do wonderful jobs, especially Meryl Streep.

3026411,5,B000YDJG0I,"A lot has been said about actor/director Robert Redford's film LIONS FOR LAMBS, that it is nothing more than a 100 minute-long political science class wrapped up on celluloid.  Indeed, this is a film that relies on acting, dialogue, and story more than a lot of films that have come out in the last few years, not counting documentaries.  But maybe something like this is needed in Hollywood now: a film driven by acting, dialogue, and story more than mere action sequences, bloodshed, and smart-ass quips.  And since we are dealing with the central issue confronting America today--the War On Terror (or what it has either evolved or devolved into), that makes LIONS FOR LAMBS an impressive piece of American theater.

The film traces three different paths.  One involves a very cynical national TV news reporter (Meryl Streep) being given the job of selling a new plan to somehow finally help ""win"" the War On Terror by a very persuasive up-and-coming neoconservative Senator (Tom Cruise).  The second one involves a university professor (Redford) trying to encourage a bright but slacking student of his (Andrew Garfield) to get involved in the political process before his apathy eats him alive by relating how two previous students in his debate class put their money where their mouths were.  The third path involves those two students (Michael Pena; Derek Luke) who, as Army rangers, find themselves in Afghanistan pinned down by machine gun fire emanating from Taliban fighters on a snow-covered mountain after their chopper goes down in a storm.

As laid out by Redford and screenwriter/co-producer Matthew Michael Carnahan, LIONS FOR LAMBS makes it a point, through sharp dialogue, to remind us once again, as John Lennon once said, that ""apathy isn't it; we can do something.""  For both Pena and Luke, it means putting their lives on the line for the larger causes of freedom and democracy, even when it has long since become clear that the motivating factor is really kind of pointless.  For Streep, it means getting straight answers, even if her subject is someone who won't give anything but roundabout ones.  For Redford's university professor, it means motivating students into doing positive things to change the world and challenge authority.  And for Cruise, it means staying true to his ideology, however far removed from reality that ideology may be.

It's not too terribly surprising that Redford, because of his liberal political beliefs, would be accused of taking a liberal position in this film; it wouldn't be the first time (as ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN or THE CANDIDATE would seem to indicate).  Nor is it too hard to believe that those who would accuse him of such a bias either have not seen LIONS FOR LAMBS or have no intention of doing so but just want to attack the film for the sake of attacking it.  I felt that he did a very even-handed job of showing us both the liberal and the conservative side of the issues surrounding our War On Terror--that it isn't a simple matter of black and white, right and wrong; that taking a stand is not a mere slogan; and that having any kind of extremist ideology can blind us to the mistakes we have made in fighting this war, and the mistakes yet to be made.

Cruise does an extremely cutting job of portraying a neoconservative senator in the film; indeed, I would compare this performance to other fine actors of liberal political slants who do good jobs playing characters who are their polar opposites--Burt Lancaster in SEVEN DAYS IN MAY, and Sterling Hayden in DOCTOR STRANGELOVE.  Streep is at her usual best as the cynical TV reporter who sees our conduct in the War On Terror as a hopeless situation; and Redford never ceases to be persuasive in his own way.

LIONS FOR LAMBS definitely isn't a film for those more interested in bloodshed and testosterone.  But for those looking for what used to make Hollywood films great, namely acting, dialogue, and story, this gets a film and unequivocal recommendation from me.",1198800000,8,3998,4.861561119293078
3026412,2,B000YDJG0I,"As I watched ""Lions for Lambs"", the new film directed by Robert Redford, starring Redford as a college professor, Meryl Streep as a journalist in Washington and Tom Cruise as a Senator, I felt as though I was sitting in a college lecture class, listening to many of the same topics we discussed when I was in school. And that was almost twenty years ago.

The strange thing is, as much as I agree with the politics of this film, I was bored out of my skull.

A little more than two thirds of the film involves actors talking with one another, discussing politics, ideology, and the like. But this is a film. It isn't a play. A film should not be lecturing us, it should tell a story about characters that move us to the point of action. There is an attempt to do this, but it doesn't involve any of the three stars, so it seems to be been given short shrift, it almost seems like an after thought added to give the film a little action.

Janine Roth (Streep), a journalist well respected in Washington circles, rushes to the office of Senator Jasper Irving (Cruise). Irving has asked Roth to meet so he can tell her about a new offensive they are spearheading in Afghanistan. She is surprised to find he has set aside a full hour for their meeting and proceeds to get the facts about this new operation. During the course of their conversation, she peppers him with questions about the status of the war, the decisions made, what we did wrong, etc. At approximately the same time in California, Professor Malley (Redford) meets with one of his promising students, Todd Hayes (Andrew Garfield). Todd hasn't been attending class and Malley wants to know why;. They begin to talk about taking a stand, making a difference, etc. When Malley realizes he isn't getting through, he tells him about the last two students who `gave me any hope'. Through flashbacks, we see how Ernest Rodrigues (Michael Pena, ""Crash"") and Arian Finch (Derek Luke, ""Catch A Fire"", ""Antwone Fisher"") once excited the professor by challenging him then made the decision to enlist in the Army soon after 9/11. The story then flashes to present day again and we see these same two soldiers leading the new offensive into Afghanistan.

I think it is necessary for us to discuss the same things these characters discuss, but because we are basically watching them talk for approximately 75 of the 90 minute running time of the film, there is little or no time for character development, for characters to bring us into the story, to make us care.

Streep comes closest with her portrayal of Janine Roth. As she and Senator Irving (Cruise channeling the character he played in ""A Few Good Men"") sit and talk, Roth is barely able to hide her disbelief for the Senator's new plan and his reasons behind it. She doesn't believe him and tries to get to the bottom of the matter. Irving, initially gung ho to talk with her, he set up the meeting after all, becomes more and more reluctant when he realizes she isn't falling into lock step behind him. She returns to her office and talks to her boss, trying to get him to not air the story, to not validate it and give the public a chance to accept it.

The Redford lecture is more difficult to handle because it involves flashbacks, which lead to more lectures and discussions. This story only makes its point at the very end, when Todd returns to his dorm and finally realizes how ineffectual his age group is, only because they aren't bothering to take a stand or to make their voice heard.

The actual scenes involving the offensive in Afghanistan are interesting, but brief. And even these devolve into the two main characters talking as they await rescue.

It is interesting that we have had many films in last three months telling stories about different aspects of our current involvement in the war in Afghanistan and Iraq. Last month's ""Rendition"", also featuring Meryl Streep, was more effective. It told a fictionalized story, depicting the problem with a policy we have called `rendition'. Because the film had characters, it was easier to become involved in the story. The problem with ""Rendition"" is there are too many characters and we never have a lead character we can empathize with, someone who can lead us to action. ""Lambs"" also fails to incite action because we are basically watching people discuss things we can hear in the news, or read in the paper, or see Jon Stewart make fun of in his Comedy Central program.

I have no problem with the viewpoint presented in the film, and welcome having discussions with others, but why should we pay to listen to others talk? Why not release the film and let people in for free? That might kick start some discussions.

But, of course, that's a pipedream. If the studio released the film, how would they make any money on the film? I mean, they never make any money on their films anyway, right? The biggest blockbuster can still be considered unprofitable. Let's have a discussion about this...",1196035200,4,4971,4.638636363636364
3026413,4,B000YDJG0I,"If you are among the restive viewers who have been ignoring War on Terror films in droves, or if the patter of perspectives usually found in stage plays is not your bag, then let me say first up that Lions for Lambs is not for you. A conventional ""plot"" is conspicuous by its absence, about 80% of the film is polarized chitchat, and it throws more questions into the fray than pat answers. Caveat emptor.

If, on the other hand, the idea of witty back-and-forth on issues very germane in this day and age does not make you want to run back to Seinfeld reruns, here's a taut script packed to the gunnel with some gloriously insouciant dialogue.

We follow three separate strands of it. Tom Cruise plays a presidential hopeful (but, in customary irony, he emphatically denies ever wanting to be one) who has engineered a secret new war strategy to tame the new kind of enemy that lurks overseas. The dubiously labeled ""forward operating points"", we learn. He announces this ever so speciously to a veteran reporter, played by Meryl Streep. Two soldiers, played superbly by Michael Pea and Derek Luke, implement those new orders and land in serious peril. That's the second thread with actual combat action. In parallel, Redford completes the trifecta as a political science professor in ""a California university"", down but not out by the apathy of students, trying to galvanize one of them who is drifting from studies.

All talk and no play could make Jack a dull boy. But Redford's assured direction has the clip and the pizazz to make the static seem kinetic. Streep and Cruise electrify simple banter about popularity polls and botched invasions that feel like they took place last month. There's a liberal dollop (pun intended) of wit and erudition to her talk. As though spurred by her refined touch, Tom Cruise is on a ""Magnolia""-caliber roll, bringing a creepy charisma to a senator clearly in love with the heft of his role.

Surprising, too, is how equal the newcomer Andrew Garfield is to the task of countering Redford as the wayward student whose surfer dude mannerisms conceal a keen mind. On occasion, this professor-pupil talk makes for the worst kind of dialectic--a dry and cliched public service announcement more than clever drama. But thankfully just when we are about to check our watches, we are rescued by provocative interludes of US soldiers stranded in the inclement peaks of Afghanistan. Al Qaeda's militants are depicted as shadowy creatures, literally, which is a touch disingenuous but it's not hard to overlook. The two former students who joined the US army bring enough chemistry to their roles to add an emotional edge.

But to me, therein lies the biggest ham in the script: the portrayal of these hard-working scholarship boys who trundle off into war zones because they want to do ""good"". There's been a tendency in recent years to aggrandize the common soldier which, while properly laying the blame on the political management, risks offering an unrealistic look at the experience of war. Remember&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jarhead/dp/B000DZIGDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jarhead</a>? Ultimately, these are scared kids lost in a foreign country, a reminder of the human life put at risk by high ideals and political sloganeering. Ahem, Mr. Redford.

As a critique of modern politics, however, it plays an even hand. Cruise's senator's assertions hark back to the now-(in)famous Tony Blair speech that gave a short shrift to evidence, vaguely acknowledges past mistakes while repeating them, and displays bafflement for the adversaries who refuse to play by his rules. But Streep's reporter isn't fully devoid of blame either, compromised by the media's early cheer-leading for the Iraq War and her inability to effectively question the party line.

It's rare to see a high-profile movie out of mainstream Hollywood that goes so far out of its way to include everyone, not just the like-minded. It may smack of armchair moralizing, but boring it is not. And unlike some other recent films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rendition/dp/B000WSJNWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rendition</a>, which I nonetheless enjoyed, it isn't preachy either. Instead, to coin a phrase, it's urgeful: whatever you believe, please do something about it.

A timely message wrapped in delightful theater.",1195948800,14,4421,5.287749287749287
3026414,4,B000YDJG0I,"Last year I tried to make the case that the best films of the year were the ones that scared the love of Jesus in us. They were movies which told us the world is in trouble, evil lurks everywhere, we aren't safe. It didn't matter what the films was, ""The Departed"", ""The Curse of the Golden Flower"", ""Babel"", ""United 93"" or ""Pan's Labyrinth"". This year it is a little different. The films this year seem to take us back to the 1960s. There has been a steady trend since 2004 of very political films. First they started out as documentaries; ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", ""The War Tapes"", ""No End in Sight"", ""Uncovered"", ""Hunting of a President"", ""Bush's Brain""...ect Then featured films started to tackle the issues, ""Good Night & Good Luck"", ""Syriana"" and now Robert Redford's ""Lions for Lambs"".

 ""Lions for Lambs"" surprisingly has not been getting a lot of traction. It hasn't pulled in impressive box-office, critics did not welcome it and neither did the public. It's hard to say why, but I'm glad I saw the film anyway. It's one of the better films released this year.

 Naturally, with any political film, there will be those of an opposing view who will damn the movie because it does not represent their political side. But, I think this was Redford's point. If you don't like the film, ask yourself why? Because of its politics? What about its politics don't you like? See what's happening here, a discussion, a debate. Just what we need.

 ""Lions of Lambs"",if I listened correctly, is a film which argues President Bush is incompetent, mistakes were made during the Iraq war, the media didn't question this war and Iraq is now a quagmire. We are no longer fighting in Iraq for our original intention, and the situation has escalated beyond our control and the war is not winnable.

 Many have argued the film is not saying anything new. Maybe. But what I admire about the film is the way it says what it says. People aren't going to see this movie,a shame, but, this is the kind of film that twenty years from now if my children were to watch it and ask me, is this what people thought of Bush and the Iraq war? I could look them straight in the eyes and say yes, this is exactly what people thought. ""Lions for Lambs"" then becomes a time capsule. It is a film which I think could add to our national dialogue. It takes ideas and stances on issues which many people feel and reflects them in an articulate manner.

 The film revolves around three storylines all happening at once. Redford plays a professor trying to talk a student (Andrew Garfield) into sticking to his class and recognizing his potential. Tom Cruise plays Sen. Jasper Irving a chest pounding, war hungry Republican giving an interview to reporter Janine Roth (Merly Streep) on a new military strategy, which is basically, prolong the war. And finally a military mission going on in Afghanistan, which involves two of Redford's former students, both who enlisted in the war against their professor's advice, who had been drafted in Vietnam.

 These three stories come together by the time the film ends and Redford's intentions are quite clear with the film. It is anti-Bush and anti-war. But so what? At least the film is about something. Why does the public think that is such a bad idea. Going back to the 1960s at least filmmakers then had the guts to make films about something. They were usually made by directors with last names like Godard, Bergman and Tarkovsky. I'm not saying Redford is as good as these directors but he has made a film which reminds me of the spirit of those films. Like a Godard films such as ""Tout va bien"" or ""Weekend"", ""Lions for Lambs"" is a movie which in time I think will be seen as a time capsule, a reflection  of the public's conscience.

 As you might be able to tell from my description the film is not really about anything else besides its ideas. The cinematography is not memorable,nor is the music or the editing. It is shot conventionally. The performances are good and get their point across, but I doubt Cruise or Streep will get nominated for their work here. Though both do a fine job. But despite everything,I still think people should see this film.

 Bottom-line: A perfect time capsule of the times we will. A film which deals with contemporary ideas and issues. I think one of the year's best films.",1195862400,5,4322,4.614080834419817
3026415,5,B000YDJG0I,"I mean that sincerely. It's obvious to me the two male soldiers in this movie are in love with each other! Whether they were lovers is another matter, left to one's imagination. Why do I come to this conclusion? It's based on a pattern of events. First body language. These two men are extremely comfortable being in close proximity to each other. In the college debate scene both young men were in perfect sync when speaking.  They  make a major life change together when they decide to join the army. On the helicopter they are joyously playing agility games with their hands. When one falls out of the helicopter at a great height, the other consciously decides to jump out after him. Most importantly, their final dramatic scene  is downright romantic! How many of us would give up our lives in such a way unless we were in love? To put it mildly, this is a brave and gutsy film!

This provocative story is also a call to action! I'm personally afraid of our current Executive Branch of the Federal government. Something that dampens my enthusiasm for political action.  I believe we Americans are being ruled by a bunch of lunatics with agendas we will never totally understand. While the dialog between the smart aleck college student and the wizened professor is more about this student's contempt and cynicism, reading between the lines, it's also about fear. Fear of failure, fear of the unknown, fear of getting hurt, even fear of wasting one's time.  But isn't it about time we stop being afraid, cynical or contemptuous and start doing something constructive to end the the Iraqi war? And, then  make sure this kind of  war never happens again during our lifetimes? I really hope  so!",1195257600,3,1696,4.722033898305085
3260637,1,B000YDJG0I,"This movie is Robert Redford's very uninformed and pedantic view of the war crammed into nearly two hours of shallow dialog.

Shallow dialog is really about all I can say to describe the movie.  It's about as interesting as dryer lint.  The imagery from the military scenes was surprisingly realistic and accurate (I am an Iraq War vet and nothing makes me angrier than when a movie portrays the military and doesn't take the time to get basic things like uniforms and equipment right) but that is where my praises for this movie end.  The story line was not interesting, compelling, nor did it bring anything new to the table.  It was just a slew of half-truths about why we should just disengage from the wars embedded in a forced story line where all anti-war advocates are smart and witty, and all of the hawks are just bumbling morons.

If you have anti-war views (notice I am avoiding using ""liberal"" as a derogatory) you will probably swoon at this movie, as it is candy for your crowd.

If you are hawkish, you will want to scream in the theater as Redford portrays you as a smugly naive chicken hawk.  Unless of course you're in the military, in which case we are portrayed as just a naive pawn in this dreadful war of hubris.  At all costs, Mr. Redford, don't ever present the idea that there may be mentally competent people who both believe in the war on terror, AND sign up to fight.  My gosh, that might railroad your precious idea that we're all a bunch of witless thugs with good intentions.

The entire thing was highly telling of a very disengaged view of the world from the ivory tower Redford lives in.",1195171200,13,1622,4.501706484641638
3260638,5,B000YDJG0I,": We had heard very little about  LIONS FOR LAMBS  but were eager to see these three actors in what sounded like a big-deal movie. We have also long valued Redford. We had heard about one apathetic-to-negative review in a major journal and fortunately we disregarded it. (When we got home I went onto the Internet and found a whole slew of condescending-to-hostile responses to the film.) We came out of the theatre immensely moved, with an excitement that we had not felt during and after a current movie for a very long time. I have sat, totally un-engaged, watching with a kind of detachment, feeling at long distance, watching George Clooney chase around among murky criminal mysteries in MICHAEL CLAYTON, or trying to get find some human element amid the editor's zap-zapping in the BOURNE movies while Matt Damon's real personality and style got swallowed up in all that racket, or I was slouched in my seat trying to give Ben Affleck the benefit of the doubt for his first effort as director in GONE BABY GONE and I wondered how long I could hang in  there as the sleaze got  more and repelling. For LIONS FOR LAMBS my wife and I were both halfway up toward the screen, way beyond edge-of-the seat.

 I came home and read a slew of apathetic or even hostile responses on the Internet. I couldn't believe it... Did they see the same film we had? Then I realized yet again that right now audiences and movie reviewers get in a panic if they feel they are being pushed to an opinion or a view, being ""taught,"" talked at.  This amounts now to the to the kind of panic that we used to say when a film was alleged to be ""sentimental.""

 LIONS FOR LAMBS is not preachy, not dutiful, ""educational"" or ""good for you."" It is eloquent, perceptive and dramatically riveting. I haven't been aware of listening that intently in a movie in a very long time. Dialogue, people talking, seems to have gone out of movies. That is left for novels, some stage plays and some TV.  This movie is written, so that when people speak, they say things that express who they are, where they are hurting or excited or struggling or passionate. It's a golden opportunity for the actors, the three stars and several others. Redford is not just a presence in our cultural life and a celebrant and furtherer of quality films. He is an astute director and his own kind of passionate actor. He plays a college professor, a long way from the Sundance Kid, a teacher struggling to get through to a cynical, bright and stalled student. It's impossible to miss  this teacher's passionate commitment.

Tom Cruise, an actor so easily dismissed because of highly publicized media events, gives a devastating portrayal of a smooth, charming, manipulative senator on the rise.  Meryl Streep plays a journalist, in her 50's, whose own vision, conscience, and awareness develop before our eyes.  It's an astounding portrayal of someone learning, discovering beyond an already sophisticated base. And anyone who is ""in education"", as teacher, counselor, parent, knows the feeling of coming face to face with a hugely frustrating, vividly promising young person , powerfully embodied by Andrew Garfield, an actor new to me.

There is a lot more. A whole third piece to the drama has two college students making a very major decision with very major results 3000 miles from the classroom.  But I'll stop with this: please don't miss this movie. And when people tell you  ""the reviews"" were apathetic or hostile, pay no attention.

 We are still intently there, listening to those conversations, watching those events, seeing the faces and images, almost holding our breath to get it all, not to miss anything. I urge you to see it.

3260639,3,B000YDJG0I,"An overtly political thought-provoker from old school Hollywood liberalist Robert Redford, Lions For Lambs marks the first feature from the revamped United Artist studio. Exploring the faith of two US soldiers dropped behind enemy lines through three parallel narratives all linked to the two men, Lambs marks an extreme departure for Tom Cruise the actor, as he plays a Machiavellian hotshot Republican senator who gives a one hour interview to Streep's experienced (if somewhat disillusioned) reporter. Meanwhile, Robert Redford's idealistic college professor lectures a potentially brilliant, but lazy student on the dangers of not harnessing his natural leadership skills, by using two of his former students (the two now lost in Afghanistan) as an example of standing for something they truly believed in. Designed purely to poke the waning fires of debate, Lions For Lambs is a powerful film that asks questions not only of the American government, but also its citizens and (most notably) its media. The point here is a simple but staggeringly profound one - if you don't stand for something, then you fall for everything.  Performance-wise, Cruise holds up surprisingly well, as he plays Senator Jasper Irving with a hint of a narcissistic undertone that gives the movie star his best role since just that flick. It may not be the Oscar contender some had predicted, and it may not set the box office alight, but it is an effective catalyst for diplomacy through art, and will surely spark communicative efforts, even amongst the least political viewer. Smart and engaging, with a reflective power, Lions For Lambs is not perfect filmmaking by any means, as it falters slightly around the middle - but it still begs for mass viewings from an information-starved public.",1195084800,3,1777,5.191637630662021
3260640,4,B000YDJG0I,"This movie is obiviously commentary on the current sittuation in Iraq.

Playing the proverbial college professor, Robert Redford is concerned that some of the students who profess to be 'inspired by him' ultumately decide to enroll in the millitary. For he had not actually encouraged them to enlist, just to do something with their lives to make a difference in the world. He is convinced that this intervention is not the best way to make a difference in the world.

Meanwhile, Tom Cruise is the villan. He plays Senator Jasper Irving, the Republican, who not incidentally is the quintisental hawk. Cruise can really play evil good. Honestly, I forgot that this was the same man who I and several other women swooned over growing up. I was also certain that this portion of the screenplay is a thinly veiled commentary on ever shrinking Congressional identification with the GOP/retirements.

It's a good movie. The only reason why I am convinced it's not getting heavy attendance in theaters is because people don't neccessarily want a 'serious' movie during the holiday season. This might be something which would attract large crowds during the summer. The people who do go in will not be disappointed.",1194912000,4,1207,4.9950248756218905

Fortunately,its 80+ minutes was about all I really could have stood from Redford's unengaging cinematic approach to LIONS FOR LAMBS.I am not suggesting that what this film has to say is anything at all that I would personally disagree, it 's just simply I found the style of the film 100% un-cinematic and uninteresting. Frankly, a documentary such as NO END IN SIGHT was IMO far more compelling than this turkey,Streep,Cruise,Redford or no Streep,Cruise,Redford;  their presence does not make this a great film to watch just like the recent remake of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.Doesn't the old saying go,""Children should be heard and not seen""?....well, if it doesn't it should!
Glad I got to see this at a free screening. It was a major disappointment!",1194825600,4,927,4.980645161290322
3260642,3,B000YDJG0I,"""Give a Damn!"" That was Yippie* leader Jerry Ruben's axiom during the sixties.  He also said, ""Do It!""  Another famous slogan was, ""If you're not a part of the solution, you're a part of the problem.""  Although not axiomatic, Professor Stephen Malley (Robert Redford) reaches out to one of his brightest students, Todd (Andrew Garfield), and barters with him to come back and attend his class.  The banter between Dr. and student is filled with wit and insight.  Still, Dr. Malley makes those sayings new [from his perspective] as a Vietnam War veteran whose only injuries were sustained on the picket line when he returned home and protested the war.  Yet, that is the statement of 'Lions for Lambs' theme:  Take a stand and do something.  (*That's not a typo; it stood for Y.outh I.nternational P.arty.)

In the meantime, a Peggy Noonan-esque reporter, Janine Bach (Meryl Streep), is interviewing G.O.P. Senator Jeremy Irving (Tom Cruise) in his private chamber.  As they speak, new troops are filtering into the mountains of Afghanistan, one meant to bring a victory to the War on Terror and build momentum for toppling Iran's nuclear capability.  He offers her an exclusive pipeline to his office and the developments of this new ""surge"" in troops.  She comes cordially--like she's a friend--but isn't afraid to ask tough questions during the interview--but they are the kind a conservative columnist would certainly ask.  Will she take his offer?  In later scenes, she and her editor spar over just that.

The third front brings the only real action of the picture.  Colonel Falco briefs and commands his troops sent via chopper to the mountains of Afghanistan.  His Q and A session with his men, particularly with Ernest Rodriguez (Michael Pena) tells us a good deal.

Much of the movie is a one on one debate between two speakers, each playing Devil's Advocate for one another.  In similar fashion, I will now engage in a debate on the merits of the movie with my own Devil's Advocate.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devil's Advocate:  This film is like the title of an old Psychedelic Furs album, 'Talk, Talk, Talk'.  Why should anyone want to see it?

JP:  One has to take the film by its quality--not by its format--'My Dinner with Andre' is considered one of Louis' Malle's masterpieces--and all it has is talk.

D.A.:  You've never seen `My Dinner with Andre'.  How would you know?

JP:  Well, it's one of the most revered movies.  It's like on  those ""Greatest Movies"" lists by Roger Ebert, et al. Even to rent it you have to practically inherit a copy from a deceased relative for cry eye!  In principle it still proves a good movie can have just talk.

D.A.:  Why not see a documentary--like 'No End in Sight'?

JP:  The wit and banter of this movie are formidable.  I mean--I think they grapple at the truth, skipping the idea that everything's all black and white.  They ask the right questions and at least offer some compelling answers--not final answers, mind you, but good ones.  By all means, see both.

D.A.:  Why not save your money and stay at home and watch CNN and Fox News each for half an hour?

JP:  The caliber is richer and more condensed in this movie.  It's more worthwhile.

DA:  Is this cinematic ping pong match really better than sitting on your couch and watching Jon Stewart?

JP:  I don't know if it's better...It's just different.  It challenges you from all sides.  The movie asks difficult questions and makes some great, pointed observations.

D.A. Is anyone going to win an Oscar for this movie?

JP:  No, but the performances are natural and believable throughout.

DA:  Why should we believe a reviewer who gave one star to 'Conversations with Other Women' and two stars to 'The Death of Mr. Lazarescu,' but also gave 'The Guardian' four stars and 'Flyboys' five?!

JP:  When I sat down to give points to movies at the end of the year, I discovered  that while 'The Death...' was too ""real time,"" and I still hated 'Conversations...'; objectively, they were well crafted and original.  I still felt better about those two favorites, but they fell in value.  You have a point, though.  Now that I have a point system I use, I can be more objective than just how I feel about a movie.

DA:  You're on the defensive, I see, but I have to admit that you have improved.  But, this conversation is going nowhere, which is about what I'd say about the movie.

JP:  It's just like you to try and have the last word.

DA:  Yep.  But, remember,  you're the one controlling the dialogue for both of us.  It's contrived, just like the exchange in the movie...See yah!!!",1194825600,5,4649,4.782828282828283

Both parties carry equal blame and I have yet to find a realistic answer to the problem but this film has renewed my resolve to be part of the solution.",1194739200,5,598,4.5092592592592595
3260644,2,B000YDJG0I,"**1/2

""Lions For Lambs,"" director Robert Redford's all-star dissertation on life in a post-9/11, ""War on Terror""-dominated world (and easily the most sermonizing movie since ""Crash""), takes place in three entirely separate locales: a United States senator's office in Washington D.C., an unnamed university campus in California, and a remote, snow-covered hillside in rural Afghanistan.

In the first setting, Tom Cruise plays a smarmy Republican lawmaker who has decided to grant an exclusive briefing to a seasoned political reporter (Meryl Streep) regarding a new military strategy the Americans are implementing in Afghanistan.  In the second sphere, Redford is a veteran political science professor who is trying to convince a bright but deeply cynical student to overcome his apathy and to become actively engaged in the political process.  Finally, Michael Pena and Derek Luke are two of the professor's former students who a few years earlier decided to put their lives on the line by joining some special op forces and who are currently trapped behind enemy lines after the helicopter on which they are riding comes under intense artillery fire while on a mission.

Thoughtful and timely political discourse is such a rare commodity on American screens these days that one feels downright ungrateful for not responding more positively to Redford's film.  Matthew Michael Carnahan's screenplay comes with an obviously liberal slant, but it does try more than most to be reasonably fair-minded in the points it is making and to see things from a multiplicity of angles.  The problem is that, for all its good intentions, the film comes across more like a TV or radio debate than a full-fledged fictional drama.  Redford's talking-heads directorial style results in a series of static mini lectures, virtually devoid of passion, cohesion or drama.  How can Redford expect the audience to get all worked up and agitated about the issues he's presenting when he himself seems to be having so much trouble doing so?

The didactic tone leaves very little room for any actual character development, with the people in the film functioning as little more than convenient mouthpieces for the writer and director.  This is a shame because the movie has some cogent points to make about patriotism, political apathy, materialism, celebrity culture, the government's use of fear and paranoia in manipulating the masses, and the responsibility a free press has in exposing corruption and deceit, particularly in a time of national crisis.  Yet, the movie itself is so academic, inert, and talky that whatever issues it is raising get submerged in the tedium.  Oddly, the movie has a clunky disjointedness that one generally encounters in films adapted from stage plays, even though the screenplay in this case is apparently an original creation.

In the role of actor, Redford comes across as smug and condescending as the professor, while Todd Hayes exhibits zero charisma as the supposedly brilliant boy whose soul Redford seems intent on saving (or, at least, kick-starting into the future).  Cruise and Streep play off each other well in the scenes they have together, and it's especially interesting watching Streep portraying a character who is the antithesis of the one she plays in the similarly-themed (but much better) ""Rendition.""  Pena and Luke are given far too little screen time to make much of an impression as the two lads who demonstrate their patriotism through actions rather than mere words.

One could live with the movie's preachiness if the film itself were at least well done, but ""Lions For Lambs"" fails because it commits the one unpardonable sin of dramaturgy - it places its story at the service of the message rather than the other way around.  Thus, instead of a work of art, what we get is a piece of well-intentioned agitprop - a high class poli sci lesson in place of a compelling movie.",1194652800,12,3917,5.122448979591836
3260645,4,B000YDJG0I,"The title ""Lions for Lambs"" refers to a quote from a German General during WWI regarding the British army.  The Germans were most impressed with the Brit soldiers' fighting ability, but they didn't particularly respect the men who commanded them. Essentially, unblooded, starched collar men were setting objectives for a war they knew nothing about.

""Lions for Lambs"" takes place over a very short period of time--less than a day in three separate scenarios. It opens with Janine Roth (Meryl Streep), a veteran reporter of 40 years, being granted an exclusive one on one hour with Senator Jasper Irving.  In the interview, the Senator extols that Ms. Roth help him sell a new initiative for the US war with Afghanistan. This initiative had begun 10 minutes before their interview commenced. Essentially, the US Forces in Afghanistan are going to use small point insertion of troops to break the enemy's back--very similar to the plan General Abrams used in Viet Nam. Can the Senator get Ms. Roth's support for this new plan and sell it to the US people?

Next, we see Prof Steven Malley (Robert Redford) talking with Todd (Andrew Garfield, a student from his political science class. He offers Todd a deal--either accept a blue collar B for A work and non-attendance or entertain a proposition. Why did he offer it?  Because Todd was one of the few students who showed true potential and encouraging those people to do something with their lives was why Malley still taught college. Can he convince Todd to enter the program he's suggesting?

The final set of people we see are two students Prof Malley mentioned in his talk with Todd. Ernest Rodriguez (Michael Pea) and Arian Finch (Derek Luke) are two of the US Special Forces unit who are parachuting into Afghanastan to ""show the enemy the full measure of American mean."" Their helocopter is fired on due to poor intelligence and Rodriguez is knocked out of the craft. Arian follows him in the jump--to stay with his 'brother' in both arms and spirit. The damaged helo has to leave due to the continued fire. Can Command get a chopper back in time to rescue the two brave soldiers?

These are the basic questions involving the three groups of people, but of course there's more discourse than that.  Essentially, the Senator's and Professor's portions of the film are all talk and the two soldiers' are mostly action. Redford manages to entwine the three storylines almost flawlessly. There are only a couple of flashbacks in Redford's own scenes and they forward the story along. Performances by all the major cast were excellent.  Meryl Streep was the best I have ever seen.

My one star deduction is for the simplicity and heavy-handedness of the message. ""Lions"" came a hair close to being preachy.",1194566400,19,2757,4.859275053304904
3260646,3,B000YDJG0I,"Perceptively enlightened, Robert Redford's political propaganda film ""Lions for Lambs"" loosely translates into smart entertainment. Exceptionally strong acting and fully fleshed characters are unfortunately unable to disguise Redford's opinionated brand of current events, and he often teeters dangerously close to the edge of being an army recruiter. Despite the occasional overbearingly preachy tone, the three steadily converging storylines showcase top-notch direction and allow clever dialogue fodder for the always enjoyable cast to consume with pomp, irony and satire.

Senator Jasper Irving (Tom Cruise) calls upon reporter Janine Roth (Meryl Streep) to receive an exclusive one-hour interview with himself to discuss his new plan to win the war on terror. As he engages in a verbal struggle to make the veteran reporter see his reasoning, his plan of action is already taking effect as a top-secret mission in the Middle East finds two best friends Arian and Ernest (Derek Luke and Michael Pena) abandoned in the cold confines of an icy plateau, waiting for rescue and surrounded by the enemy. Meanwhile, Dr. Stephen Malley (Robert Redford), the professor who negotiated with the two soldiers not to go to war, holds a meeting with another hopeful student who shows promise and potential.

Lions for Lambs demonstrates Redford's seasoned talents as a director through the use of three initially separate storylines progressing simultaneously. As the film draws to a close, it becomes more apparent how closely those three groups of people are related, the fact that all three events take place at the same time, and the extreme differences in world affair opinions that each group holds. Despite the occasional flashback, the film is entirely sequential and in chronological order - something few films still do, especially when multiple plot lines are concerned.

Lions for Lambs works as both a public service announcement and Redford's own propaganda. While Janine condemns Irving's elusively intelligent words and intimidating propaganda, Redford also spoon feeds the audience with his perceptions of the war on terror. What saves the film from collapsing on its own hypocrisy is the outstanding performances by all of the main characters. In a moment of climactic cinematic irony, Cruise discusses the effectiveness of the trained professional soldiers stationed in the Middle East, as the covert operation over Iran tragically unravels and casualties are quickly incurred.

Cruise is inspired as the fast talking, patriotic, red-blooded American Senator who weaves a tale for the press with powerful words and piercing determination. Streep is equally outstanding as the reporter who, despite years of accepting her role as merely a go-between for ruthless politicians to rally their public image, suddenly gains a conscience that forces her to question her position. Redford stars as the professor who is convinced that his talents lie in discovering students with the potential to make a difference, as he did with Arian and Ernest who he was unable to prevent from going off to fight for their beliefs.

While heavily opinionated propaganda films rarely equal grand entertainment, Redford is careful to insert a grandiose finale that paints a glowing picture for targets of his mindset on the war. Whether you agree with his outlook and his representation of the ""whatever it takes"" attitude of the government, Lions for Lambs is arguably well-made and brilliantly constructed. And Cruise Photoshoped into photographs with President Bush, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice are hilariously priceless.

Senator Jasper Irving (Tom Cruise) explains to Janine Roth (Meryl Streep) his plans and strategies for dealing with the Afghanistan military situation.  Janine Roth explains to her colleague (Kevin Dunn) what she thinks has begun with the news and details she has been given about Afghanistan. There is a strong and enduring friendship between the characters of Ernest Rodriguez (Michael Pena) and Arian Finch (Derek Luke) that endures both through college and when they go off to Afghanistan together.

And Redford's essentially static staging of his own scenes --if understandable for an actor also directing and on a limited budget and schedule-- pretty much nullified illuminating the egotism of sophomoric college students rationalizing their lazy, shallow life-choices (not something all college students do, as the combat scenes show).

The film does a very clever thing my interleaving three different plot lines in three different parts of the world. It also does a very clever thing by not explaining their connection or pushing a conclusion on the viewer. The ending of the film is a good example. No conclusion is given, the ending is strangely open. And how can it not be? When the question addressed is: what shall we do with this life?

I luv this film, directed by redford. redford isn't getting enough respect from critics, Oscars. looking at this film in light of recent events in irag is amazing. the tom cruise character, sort of a young john McCain conservative, may have been meant to be the antagonist (i.e., conservative ""war monger"") in the film, tho redford presented him and the other characters view points pretty even handedly. with the rise of ISIS in Iraq, the cruise character seems prescient. whatever your politics, this is a well made thought provoking film. the biggest point of the film is how the gov't has almost been given a free hand in what it does by an apathetic public and a spoon fed news media. this point is made with the redford and andrew Garfield (spiderman) characters. the final shot to me is a classic on the level of rosebud in citizen kane. Garfield is watching CNN where the anchor is filling the country in on the latest gossip about some celebrities, while there is a crawl on the bottom of the screen regarding a recent military action, which the film has centered on and which has cost the lives of 2 young patriots we also met in the film. Garfield  and a friend are watching this while loafing on a sofa ""potato couch"" syle. BRILLIANT and oh so true. the country isn't really fully engaged in our wars. and the media is very controlled by a few largely economic interests. this film deserves a look.",1408233600,7,1482,4.613636363636363

3260733,3,B000YDJG0I,"Lions for Lambs is a political drama film about the connection between a platoon of United States soldiers in Afghanistan; a U.S. senator and a reporter; and a college professor and a bright student. It also casts three well-known Hollywood performers in Redford,Streep and Cruise.

This is both a well-acted and a highly-charged political film that will affect many Americans as its themes are about issues that are affecting the United States particularly the Iraq War. It may also have irked many conservatives to the fact that it took a liberal position about the issues discussed.

Unfortunately,it did not do well in the box office as it was talky and the discussions among the characters dominated the film instead of having a story in it. That could have bored many viewers to death especially if one's intention is to watch the film and how their favorite actor/actress perform in it instead having them talk about the current state of affairs of the United States. Added to that,I felt that it also was too early to make a conclusion of how the issues tackled particularly the Iraq War will determine the country's future as well as the to whether it proved to be good or bad to the United States in its history during the time it was released.",1405296000,,1254,4.747706422018348

3260741,4,B000YDJG0I,"I totally agree with the sentiment and intention of this film however it becomes too much of an academic lecture.  I actually think 30 more minutes should have been added to the film with much more emphasis on the two young enlisted men fighting in Afghanistan and less time on the lecture Robert Redford gives to one of his college students.

When the United States is at war, the party in power has to continually spin the story to keep the American public engaged, to frame every event to the advantage of the United States, to simplify every confrontation into good versus evil, and to cover up all the vest interests such as defense contractors that keep the war machine moving. I think Tom Cruise did an outstanding job as a GOP Senator trying to put a new spin on a bogged down situation in Afghanistan.  Anyone who has studied world history knows that Afghanistan is the quick sand black hole of the great powers and England, the USSR, and the United States have all been sucked into this country of tribes and warlords and ever shifting allegiances and resources. Cruise does an admirable job of trying to convince veteran reporter Meryl Streep that this is something new, somehow a light in the forest that will help America defeat the enemy and leave as victors. Of course Streep does not buy it, she realizes we are fighting ghosts and an enemy that can disappear into the villages and crowds without detection. Of course her superiors in the news industry ask her not to analyze the information, just report on the information. Redford is a college political science professor. He has a powerful presence and his idealism shines through his pores, but he gives too long a lecture and I fear that he loses the audience with too many words. He should have made his point with the two former students now fighting in Afghanistan, trying to make a difference in a world that doesnt want anything to be different.

I liked the film, don't get me wrong, and I would recommend it but with a little more action and a little less lecture it could have made a more powerful statement.",1389312000,,2087,4.617250673854447

3260743,2,B000YDJG0I,"Lions for Lambs was, to me, a poor attempt at a good idea. This film is supposed to be showing war from several angles; specifically, the consequences of war and the reactions to it. Tom Cruise' character is the politician using the war to further his campaign. Meryl Streep is the news reporter covering the proposed new plan for the war, and Michael Pena is a soldier fighting this new plan. This was a good THOUGHT, but the execution was done so poorly I couldn't enjoy it. Tom Cruise' new plan was to put small groups of fighters on mountain tops so they could see everything and the enemy can't move. Ask anyone who has served in action and they will laugh at that plan to end terrorism.

Meryl Streep is the veteran journalist, yet she reacts more emotionally then a rookie to every piece of information she discovers. It is very distracting.

Michael Pena and his partner are made out to be a highly trained (Special Forces if I recall correctly?) fighter, who then makes silly decisions that don't make sense.

I love that Carnahan was inspired to write this questioning story after the discomfort of seeing a US soldier death report as a ticker during a college game broadcast. It's amazing how poorly this film performed in its time. Cruise, Redford and Streep are about as big a draw as they come. True, 2007 was when the media was questioning Cruise's sanity.

But not a hugely engaging one at that.  Half the movie is listening to Robert Redford, as a university professor, talking to one of his lazy students in his office and telling him to get his act together, come to class and 'care' about things.  I'm all for caring about things but I still found the movie rather lame.  Definitely no Oscar moments for any of the actors.  Not a character driven movie in any sense.

Second, the media's morphing from the fourth estate to the fourth branch of government; a complicit enabler of public duping and a whore to ratings and lowest common denominator pandering. Lastly, it delivers a solid punch in the nose to America the Apathetic.

While the back and forth between Streep and Cruise plays like all the other left/right debates on any Sunday morning program, the give and take between Redford as a university professor and his increasingly self-centered but once-promising student is well done. Some have complained that Redford lectures, and he does (he is playing a professor...), but his student volleys with equal skill and you hear a debate that is not heard enough; what's the right choice for someone in this land of plenty?

America has become so powerful and wealthy that we have people who are poor yet fat, and possess cell phones and flat-screens, thus no desire to change their circumstances. The new ""heroes"" of our society are business-people or entrepreneurs, those nauseatingly-dubbed ""job creators,"" whose overarching goal is not the betterment of society but rather the fattening of their bank account. Those people are enabled by politicians who are equally self-serving and cynical. Furthermore, we have become so spoiled by our excess that we no longer care to improve (and in some cases, if one tries to improve America, their loyalty is called into question) or even perpetuate this experiment called The United States of America, but rather seek to get ours while we can and to hell with the future.

And everyone's choice was important.  And everyone was making a choice or living with the consequences of a choice they recently made.
In this approach, the death of these two young men, as they change and impact all these totally different people's life decisions, demonstrates their greatest breadth of humanity.  These young men and the loss of their potential in this world is suddenly not just personally of heroic proportions, but suddenly of earthshaking proportion as well.  Intentionally or not, the immense strength of the connection between people becomes a character of it's own almost at the climactic moment but you don't know it yet!  Not til is shows itself in the last scenes within the lives of these different people.  And in that connectivity is inherently once again the immense value of human life.  Beautiful!  Beautifully done! A new emotional experience- a new way of telling a story- a new rhythm of emotion to help us all learn a new dance of the spirit!  I think it may have irritated some because it didn't have the same climactic feel we have wanted since the days of Greek tragedy.  But you know, Greek Tragedy is a strongly masculine rhythm.

VERY impressive movie, especially Meryl, the reluctant news reporter at the end of her career who refuses to go along with the ""official"" war justifying bulls__t despite warnings from her news editor,  and Redford was BRILLIANT as the college professor who rescues a brilliant student who has fallen into apathy after starting one of the most interesting class debates and discussions, without having done the reading assignment, in an earlier class,  and Cruise was equally brilliant as the up and coming U.S. Senator presidential candidate to be who justifies the war ""strategy"" (sic) with the usual preposterous strategical  rationalizations while two of Redford's former students, who joined the army and are there to ""make a difference"" die minutes before a rescue copter can arrive at a frozen ridge in Afghanistan.

Redford's directed some genuinely terrific films over the years -- ""Quiz Show"", ""The Horse Whisperer"", ""A River Runs Through It"" and ""Ordinary People"" are among his standouts for me -- but the very first rule of movies has always, always been, first and foremost, to ENTERTAIN its audience ... and on THAT score, especially, ""Lions For Lambs"" fails miserably and completely (second only, perhaps, to Brian DePalma's similarly-preachy and -awful, ""Redacted"" -- another movie that was clearly inspired by the war in Iraq).

The film doesn't work on so many levels that it's almost pointless to mention them. Actually, it is pointless. But: poor writing and casting are what sink it. Unconvincing characters speaking mediocre dialogue.

One mini-positive: I can't think of a single film that has gotten journalists right since All the President's Men. Russell Crowe was awful as a journalist in another film where Americans proved they're not so stupid. (Ben Affleck was awful too, but ...)

3260779,5,B000YDJG0I,"By the mid 1990's Tom Cruise had become the #1 box office star in the world. Because of his huge success in the ""Mission:Impossible"" films he also became known as an action film actor. So it's nice to see Tom in a film without him shooting a gun and trying to kill the bad guys. In ""Lions For Lambs"" Tom plays a U.S. senator giving an interview to a Washington journalist. He discusses the wars in Iran and Afganistan and his take on how the American government is dealing with the War On Terror.

 The film actually deals with three separate storylines with the same theme: the first one with Tom's character; the second in which Robert Redford plays a California college professor where he chats with a college student and discovers the young man's opinion on the wars; and lastly we see two young and brave soldiers actually fighting in the wars and their ultimate demise.

 Critics and fans hated ""Lions For Lambs"" with a passion. I have watched it several times and although it's not Tom Cruise's biggest film it is a thought-provoking and extremely well-written account of one of the most controversial wars in the last 100 years. The movie makes one re-evaluate your own opinions and thoughts on the invasion of Iran and Afganistan, the real reason why these wars started, and should they continue.

 Robert Redford also directed the film and with a $35,000,000 budget the picture made over $60,000,000, so despite what most say it was a success.",1297123200,,1453,4.700787401574803

Unlike any film I've seen recently, it relies primarily on dialogue, rather than action, to deliver its message. Although the main subject of the film is U.S. involvement in a war in Afghanistan, it uses three different story lines, all taking place simultaneously, to portray how the media, government, and education systems can shape and/or manipulate our attitudes about so many things.

Each story line is interesting and thought-provoking in a unique way. Although not a documentary, you can't help but draw many parallels to the current situations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Mostly, it asks us to examine our own personal responsibility and choices to take action, rather than remain apathetic or indifferent.

3260782,3,B000YDJG0I,"Lions For Lambs (2007) was a movie I was anxious to see when I heard about it several years ago before it was released. But then it got bad reviews and I shifted it to my DVDs To Watch list. Finally getting around to it recently, I felt the movie was average (3 stars out of 5). I have enormous respect for Robert Redford and love many of his movies, but this was not one of his better efforts in my opinion. I think the script lacked emotional connection and originality. It was too dry and journalistic for my taste. I do think the acting was good by the supporting cast, but headliners Robert Redford, Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep were all lacking in their performances...and they were the main reasons I was attracted to this movie originally. Cruise simply plays a character that doesn't fit him and it showed. He's stiff and unbelievable in his role as a Republican Senator. Same with Streep as a news reporter I think. And while Redford's teacher did fit him, he simply didn't have enough good scenes and enough depth within the overall story to make up for the rest. The best scenes in the movie are with him and Andrew Garfield (the new Spider-Man), so I recommend watching the movie simply for those scenes.

While some would argue that the reason this movie fails is because of its liberal political bias, I didn't find that to be a problem for me. I think the story was simply not developed enough and not executed in a way to make it connect with its viewers. Technically the movie feels and looks fine.

3260784,5,B000YDJG0I,"Lions for Lambs is not your regular movie with a main plot, two or three antagonists and one protagonist that act to mesmerize its audience with either song and dance or somber melodrama. This movie is a message sender. It is delivered in three discourses of inter-related dialogue occurring between six pivotal characters. Directed by Robert Redford and released on November 9th 2007, I came into this one a bit late.

I am quite glad I did after reading the many well done reviews about this picture, I was convinced to borrow it from my sweetie. Once watched, I immediately transcribed my scribble into meaningful material for this review because I didn't want to give away the whole movie but rather encourage a viewer to sit and watch it for what it delivers without any expectations of past war or drama genre films.

I suggest keeping in mind that conversations with professors and students, journalists and exposes, and power point presentations in classrooms take considerable amounts of time; therefore the 92 minutes this film is drawn out for is for very good reason. You cannot send lambs out to do the the work reserved for lions unless you prep them, guide them, talk to them, learn them and most of all use a 'whatever it takes attitude' to get them to 'wake up and pay attention', and that is a slow process.

The film offers a quality cast of actors in Redford choosing himself of course as Professor Stephen Malley, Meryl Streep (from MamaMia 2008, Doubt 2008, Julie and Julia 2009) as journalist Janine Roth, Tom Cruise (from Tropic Thunder and Valkyrie in 2008) as US Senator Jasper Irving, Michael Pena (from The Lucky Ones 2008 and Observe and report 2009) as soldier Ernest Rodriguez, Andrew Garfield (from The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus 2009) as student Todd Hayes (one of my favorites), Peter Berg (from Hancock 2008 unaccredited) as Lt.

The storyline is... actually it's divided into three separate stories, each one focusing on the political side of the spectrum.

It's pretty weird at first how the movie keeps jumping around between the three stories, but eventually you'll adjust to the approach the movie writers are going for. It's weird, but it works.

Two of the stories are definitely more interesting than the third. The one involving Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise's character having detailed (though somewhat cool and rational) conversations focusing on the war in Afghanistan is definitely the best of the three storylines (plus they frequently mention Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries, keeping things relevant to the real world).

The other storyline where you see the actual fighting take place over in Afghanistan is probably the second best of the three stories, however, what strikes me as disappointing is the fact that the entire war scene in Afghanistan involving the two soldiers who were on ground and forced to fight for their lives took place at night with snow blowing around, so you couldn't really SEE any of the fighting taking place. This has been a problem with many Hollywood movies as of late- having great difficulty actually seeing the action for whatever reason.

The very end of the film involving the two soldiers is a VERY emotional moment, and probably the best part of the film.

I didn't quite get the significance of the third storyline involving the college student having a classroom conversation with his teacher, unless the meaning is that ""you're young, things change as you get older, so do what you love while you're still young"".

Now, I'm going to be honest here- I'm not someone who normally follows politics, at least, not on a deep level where I feel the need to keep myself up to date every single day on the events taking place around the world. I do watch the news, I do read about many other countries and problems all the time, and I make sure I'm always at least aware what's going on in the world.

However, someone who follows politics on a frequent basis may find much of the storytelling in Lions for Lambs predictable, and nothing they haven't seen before. My logic is- if I can follow along to the storyline easily, someone who's heavy and extremely knowledgeable on politics probably will think the movie isn't that great.

I really liked Lions for Lambs, but the film is only recommended if politics are something you have a not-so detailed interest in.",1261958400,,2740,4.812765957446809

""Lions for Lambs"" offers a few good scenes between Redford's impassioned professor and Andrew Garfield's ambivalent student, but the overwhelming preachiness negates any dramatic momentum.",1254009600,2,592,6.144578313253012

This film, directed by Robert Redford, draws you into many of the central issues of America's war on terror. You will find yourself rooting for everyone to do the right thing. What is that?

3260814,5,B000YDJG0I,"This is one of the strangest film we can imagine about the end of Dubya's war on terror, alas not the end of the war per se. It is all centered on Afghanistan but it is essentially conveyed in the paranoid fear of human beings. Like the Christian God, this story is based on three characters, three story tellers, three episodes that overlap and crisscross from one to the other constantly. On one side a university professor who was drafted into the Vietnam war and has not yet really understood what happened then. He has negotiated a hypocritical peace with life that makes him take his anger and frustration onto the students themselves in order to confront them to decision making at any time in their life as students when this life has become boring and senseless. They know it is not going to be better than their parent's though the latter have promised them it would. And anyway, and that is what these students have forgotten, it cannot be the same, let alone better because they are just starting in life and nothing in life is given ready made and ready to eat. You have to fight for it, like it or not, and that the dear professor has forgotten it in his own mind, even if the students have forgotten it in their real life. The professor makes the students fight but for the sake of it not for any commitment, even purely selfish. The professor does not do his job since he does not teach them how to start from zero, as life requires it for 95% of people, and then have an objective other than satisfying the wants, desires or phantasms of the professor. He is not even a signpost along the road that never follows the road it is indicating, but he is a signpost in the middle of the desert pointing in any erratic direction according to the moment and the professor's impulses. The journalist in a big newspaper is confronted with  the necessity, or even the duty, to tell the public that everyone is lying to them and they believe them. But she runs out of steam to convince other people, out of steam to really corner the senator who receives her, out of steam to convince her own boss about that necessity instead of treating everything as news when it is only propaganda. She too is sort of out of phase and she will either yield or retire. She is incapable of doing her job for her boss who takes the assignment away, her job being to bring news to the public. But she is also incapable to do what she thinks her job is, that is to say bring people to reflecting and having a wider vision on things, a vision that could integrate the past into the future and vice versa, in other words be responsible and visionary. The senator is a young wolf who is ready to win the war whatever the cost  it may take because that's what politicians need, a win. Instead of drawing the conclusion from the failure that the mistakes are too heavy for life to forgive and forget them and that politicians have to stop these mistakes, they want more war and they look for the person who is going to be able to carry the message to the people and make people swallow the hard medicine instead of changing it altogether. In that trilogy - or should I say trinity? - of lost grown-ups, the film shows a few young students and how they react to this fake life, and it is not at all encouraging.  These students are lost. Whether they want to commit themselves and their life to the big battle against terrorism but they are betrayed by a bunch of incompetent officers and politicians who will announce their death as a victory. Or they want to stay out of it and enjoy life and that makes them drop-outs for one and flunkies for two. No hope there, hence a deep sense of despair. The dice have been cast and no one can decipher the message written among the dots and figures. Two years later what can we think about it? It will take a lot of energy - and hope - on the side of politicians to change their ways. It will take a lot of energy for the people to understand enjoying life cannot be the objective of life itself. It will take a lot of energy for the media to understand that their job is not to transmit the press releases of politicians but to educate and enlighten the public into thinking with their own heads. It will take a lot of energy, though I am afraid this battle is far from even having begun, for professors and teachers, educators and intellectuals to get down into the world and commit themselves to real life, which would mean more work and less ease for them, the poor darlings, my heart is bleeding for them. To defend their privileges, these professors and company are ready to break the life of their students as students and then as grown-ups and even as citizens, and they will argue that the students agree. There is always one rotten apple in a barrel of apples, as old seafarers well know.

This movie is complex in the sense that it didn't provide a neatly summarized and easily digestible answer to what is a very complicated question, mortality (i.e., how to get the best value out of ones life).

By interweaving the different plots it conveyed a contrast that couldn't have been accomplished otherwise.

But most importantly, this movie is about choices.  Whether your a journalist who realizes you are doing a disservice to your profession by going along to get along, or whether you're a student that finds comfort in being cynical as opposed to buckling down to change things for the better or perhaps if you choose to put your safety in harms way for the greater good, these are all choices that may not fit easily in one's comfort zone.  Tough choices indeed, and as such should not be expected to be dealt with cavalierly.

It's pure liberal propaganda, a documentary buried in the look, but never reality of story within it's 3 interlaced pretences at stories.  A ""story"" has literary elements, (say, ""rules of engagment"") including character, plot, setting, denoument, climax, any one of which missing renders it mere chatter.  This offered only character, opinionated characters, poorly developed.

I recently read some Hollywood somebody defending such a story as this, claiming that life has no climaxes or endings, so such stories are more realistic.  I can only pity the one who views life in such a way.  All lives DO end, and all choices lead to denouments and climaxes, whether the individual wishes to graph his own or not.  Those who spend theirs ""looking for themselves,"" and whining, ""What's it all about?"" while seeking escape in whatever poison they chose, are simply not living as God intends.  The life that is not worth dying for was not worth living.

Who could care what happened to any of these characters, other than the 2 on the battlefield, and they were far from realistic, behaving out of character for special forces fighters.

As the film gets rolling we learn that in Washington, D.C. the senator has allocated an entire hour for an inverview with the reporter.  At the same time on the west coast the professor is having a one-hour meeting with a student who shows great promise, but who is not striving to meet his own potential, and around the world we see what the two former students are doing in Afghanistan.  As time ticks by the senator reveals a new military strategy for Afghanistan, the professor tells his student about his two former students who volunteered for the army and are serving in Afghanistan, and we see how the new military strategy affects the students that are in the army.

The story develops as the interview progresses, the meeting moves along, and the fates of the two soldiers serving in Afghanistan are shown...all during the same one-hour time period.

So, it was disappointing to see the Afghani fighters portrayed as amorphous blobs on the screen, set in a scenario where the audience is to cheer for their destruction (that is, kill the ""other"" before the two likeable American boys are killed).  U.S. soldiers are portrayed as pure and heroic, Afghani soldiers are evil blobs.  This is the sort of narrative that entrenches a superiority complex in the American mind.

3260831,3,B000YDJG0I,"When I first saw the trailers and previews for the movie I thought it looked very intriguing, especially with the actors on board. Then I heard pretty quickly that it was nose-diving at the box office, mainly because of its strong political bent to the left. Now, considering most of the country had already given up on the president and reasons for going to Iraq, and this movie was STILL getting reviews of being too far to the left I thought ""Holy cow it must really be slanted"". So I skipped the theatre experience for that reason. I just now finished watching the movie on dvd and I have to say, while there is a leftward bent to it, the bent is not as pronounced as I thought it would be. I thought they juxtaposed the reasons for and against waging war in the middle east with fairly equal consideration. Certainly, the character of GOP Senator played by Tom Cruise is painted as a manipulator of the press in the movie. But I actually thought that the dialogue was fairly factually based, and the debate his character engages in with the moderately left leaning reporter played by Meryl Streep was fairly written in the script. I think the Senator brought up many important moral points to consider in the ""good vs evil and where does America fit into this"" debate.  And for that I give director Robert Redford credit, as I know he is very liberal. I have to say I didn't feel like I was watching a movie about a story, but rather something more akin to a Meet the Press debate. Which is fine, as I am interested in international politics. But that could be why it didn't do so well at the theatres and maybe why there were always stacks of dvds available at Blockbuster, as the movie can come across fairly politically preachy. I have to assume this is what turns most viewers off and killed word of mouth. Clearly Redford wanted to use this medium to tell us all what he thinks of the country and the GOP, which ain't much. Moving on... As I'm sure the other reviews mention, there are three dialogues or stories taking place - the Senator speaking with a reportor, the political science professor (Redford) motivating a gifted yet already cynical student to go into public office to make a difference in the world, and the story of two of the professor's earlier political science students deciding to serve their country by entering the military and going to battle in Afghanistan, which is really the only ""story"" part of the movie. I thought the script was well written, highly intelligent, fast paced and engaging. For this reason I think anyone with intelligence or the desire to gain knowledge in these areas will enjoy this movie, even if you disagree politically with what it is saying. It never hurts to consider different viewpoints. For the script-dialogue I give the movie 5 stars. For the plot of the film I give it 2 stars.  There really is no plot, just a lot of discussion and points of ethics and morality to ponder as we Americans try to define our future role in this crazy world.",1216512000,3,3010,4.541436464088398

3260833,4,B000YDJG0I,"This movie flopped at the box office, but it certainly didn't deserve to.  It's an intelligent, incisive, and surprisingly balanced film that addresses ongoing concerns about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan without pretension.  It's talkative and politically charged, so it's not a movie for those looking for escapist fare (as the final scene suggests most Americans are).  The most common criticism of Lions for Lambs is that its points have been echoed repeatedly by political pundits, and while that's true to some extent, there are a number of perspectives presented here that, as a whole, form an intriguing and thought-provoking work.

Director Robert Redford takes three different points of view on the overarching subject of the War on Terror: one from a hotshot Republican senator (Tom Cruise), another from a weary but still vocal history professor (Redford), and the last from two soldiers stranded on a mountaintop in Afghanistan (Derek Luke and Michael Pea) waiting for rescue but facing an imminent strike by Taliban inhabitants.  Cruise is providing an interview to a TV reporter (Meryl Streep) and Redford is making a desperate attempt to one of his students to extract him from the political apathy that has started to consume him.

The acting is uniformly good, but Cruise and Redford especially stand out.  Cruise is outstanding as the senator who is so charismatic he even convinces himself of his own lies.  Cruise doesn't just play an unctuous pen pusher though; he imbues his character with more complexity than that.  This is a man who genuinely wants to win the wars he helped get his country into and is willing to acknowledge some of his mistakes.  He doesn't want to lose any more lives than he has to, but he is also undaunted in his mission.  Redford presents a notable foil, even if the two never meet: his professor has the experience and the pain to back up his arguments, even if he is getting tired of spouting them.  There's an elegance to his performance but also an urgency to it.

The beauty of Redford's approach is that it shows the political rhetoric (as exemplified by Cruise's character), public response (seen most clearly through Redford's character interacting with his dismayed student), and the consequences (portrayed in the Afghanistan scenes) of the wars that the US government has ignited.  Most of the movie shifts between these three scenes, with some flashbacks that illuminate how a few key characters got to the states they ended up in.  It's a smart move, because it juxtaposes several different sides of the arguments for and against the wars and doesn't overwhelm the viewer with one section for too long.

The impact of the three sections is fuller and more comprehensive in this way.  At the movie's climax, all of the issues come together, and by the time the movie is over, the impact is that much more powerful.  Between the political and academic debates and the action on the ground that is the result of political decision-making, Redford successfully shows how all of us are affected by these wars in different ways.  Whether being motivated to surmount bureaucratic incompetence or deceived by its machinations, and between choosing to question and engage our political leaders and reporters or turning away from them in jadedness or indifference, we are all affected in some way and determine how complicit we become.  Americans may not be ready to engage a movie that portrays such a tragic current event, or want to for that matter, as box office receipts have repeatedly shown, but perhaps that's part of the problem.  Although long-winded at times, Lions for Lambs nevertheless understands and illuminates these messages effectively.",1216166400,,3711,5.02120717781403
3260834,5,B000YDJG0I,"The film Lions for Lambs is an honest attempt to portray the spicy geopolitical climate in its raw, unedited and costly truth. The film takes place in three films, one between two brother's in arms, another between a student and his teacher and another between a journalist and a pathocratic senator. Each vignette offers an illuminating look at the reality of our situation, and I mean our because each one of us can somehow fit into the film itself.

The brother's in arms are interestingly, two previous students of the professor we're introduced to. We're shown their military adventure in Afghanistan as they attempt to fulfill a new strategy issued by the senator. Their characters are bold, courageous, and strong-willed. They have an incredible power of conscience, and a desire to do what is right. Their failing? They lack accurate psychological knowledge of the men who lead them. They are Lions for Lambs.

The pathocratic senator is played exceedingly well by Tom Cruise. I'd never thought I'd enjoy his performance as much as I did in this film. He shows a psychopathic ability to mix words, to tug on a normal man's emotions, to lie with the cunning conviction he is right, more then that - that he is righteous - because he possesses a pathological nature that prevents him from seeing, thinking or believing otherwise. The journalist who shares his entire vignette is played by Meryl Streep, and her desire to honestly do her job and do it right comes through strong. She is invited by the senator for an hour to discuss the 'new strategy' in Afghanistan, and to help relay it to the public. She does an excellent job of asking the questions anyone of conscience would ask, and we can see Cruises' character's pathology if we pay attention.

The last vignette is between Robert Redford, who plays a professor at an unnamed California University and a student of his that shows much promise. The student has potential, but feels as if he'd be happier with a 'normal life', keeping his head down, getting a good job, and making the best out of his life without trying to play a big role in world events. He makes a good argument, but is countered by experience, wisdom and an understanding which he cannot quite grasp due to his youth. For the greater part of the interaction we're not even sure if an impact is made, if his armor is dented, but there is hope reflected in the very last scene that makes the entire bit worth it.

The core of the film is a display of the reality of our situation here in America. Our politicians are self-serving, lying, pathological monsters who are irredeemable and incapable of change. The establishment that is Mainstream Media is saturated with people who are solely 'doing their job' or so they think, by reporting what they are told - propaganda or not. Some of them are damn good people, who have a strong conscience, but due to circumstance (mostly age and financial obligations) cannot change. Their potential to be something different has dried up.

Then we are shown the best and the brightest. Two out of three of which ended up believing their abilities would best be used serving this country in it's war effort. They had the conscience, the dedication and the will to do something new, bold and dramatic - but they didn't have the knowledge that would have allowed their effort to really make an impact, and the results are given to us dramatically.

The third student is a wild card, we're really not sure what he does by the end of the film, but we're given hope that he may attempt something great - to succeed or fail matters not, but that he may attempt it gives us hope. In my mind I saw all of us as that third student. Young, smart, definitely lazy and more interested in social life and girls then knowledge and wisdom which would allow him to fight to change the world. He is the future, the potential future, it exists only as a potential because it is possible, but extremely difficult to manifest. It can only happen with dedication, conscience, and knowledge - which are much more difficult to acquire then a video game, television show, sports event or event a really hot lay.

That is the core of the film, if we want to make an impact, to make positive changes to our world, to become our potential as individuals and as a society we have to want it, we have to try for it, and we have to make it a daily effort.",1215388800,3,4393,4.6028097062579825

I watched this film for a political science class.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  There was soem really great dialogue here and the views were well balanced.  Nothing, aside from the two friends ""last stand"" at the film's end seemed hacknyed.

A lot of people complained that the movie was boring because it lacked action.  I for one, disagree.  I thought that the ideas being flushed out in the film, as well as the tension between the senator (Cruise) and the reporter (Streep), the proffesor and the bright student, and the Rodriguez and Finch's arguments with their classroom really drove this film.  And that's the problem that other's might have with it; the film is character driven, not action.

There's a lot of great ideas here.  Are we repeating the same mistakes as we did in Vietnam?  Is the news media more concerned with revenue and entertainment than it is actual news?  Does public relations drive the political process?  Also, I really liked Finch and Rodriguez's argument that the United States practises ""engagement"" all over the world, but we do not engage many of our own neighbourhoods.

The performances are stellar all the way around.  Tom Cruise plays a right wing pathological deviant in power superbly.  I was reminded of his fiendish glee playing the vampire Lestat.  Streep plays the duped, but now waking up journalist with just the right cynical weariness, and Redford, as always, puts his heart into his politics.

Who is accountable?  Those of us old enough to have lived through any part of the Vietnam Era, before ""spin"" was a PR term, can recall the indepth coverage the news media gave that war.

3260839,5,B000YDJG0I,"I saw this film with my son, who is a senior in high school.  He is a very cynical idealist, very smart, who wants to do something to improve the world, but is almost hopeless than anything can be done to fix the rampant incompetence and dysfunctionality in government and politics, the lack of principle and competence in almost every field of American endeavor, and the pervasive ""anything for a buck"" mentality.  He is such a believer, but he is so angry and disillusioned as well.  The only one out there who seems to understand what's going on and see through all the sheer idiocy that passes for public discourse is Jon Stewart, and he's essentially a comedian.

There was no one out there speaking to him until this movie.  I was astonished, and very moved, that someone cared enough to sit down and talk to my son right where he lived, and tell him what he most needs to hear.  Robert Redford wasn't speaking only to the kid in the movie; he was speaking to this new generation.  To me, the words he spoke were holy and precious, not because of political content, but because they were meant to alight and encourage a sense of purpose and hope that is too easily snuffed out and stunted today, both by the many pretty, mind-numbing distractions available to our youth and the fact that almost no one seems to be acting out of sheer principle.  I had to stop and sob a little at the end of the movie, I was so moved and grateful that someone cared enough to speak to my son and so many others like him to try to ignite the flame of hope again, to realize that if these problems are ever going to be solved, it will only come through a dedication of spirit, commitment of the body, rolling up of the sleeves, getting to work, becoming expert, and going out there to make things better.  The movie was meant to demonstrate that the sacrifices of those who have given their lives in support of our ideals demand no less.

So thank you, Robert Redford and crew.  There are some who are listening and heeding the call.

I will be buying this movie as a high-school graduation present for my son, as he begins his study of political science at college, and I hope he will play it again and again.  Let's all pray that his generation will do better than ours.",1212796800,3,2259,4.388489208633094
3260840,3,B000YDJG0I,"This is probably a great movie to recommend to 17-year-olds in the middle of their high-school Political Science assignments. Prof. Malley (Redford) imparts to his University students all the qualities that any adult with a measure of common sense should possess: not trusting every story that appears in the press, questioning the government, being able to read newspapers between the lines, being able to analyse news rather than digest it. It would be great if all these skills were taught to teenagers in high schools. It is, however, depressing when they are tauhgt by filmmakers to adults (who are, presumably, the target audience here). Worse still, the filmmakers do their job poorly, and the movie sizzles out before it even begins. As the credits begin to roll, you realise that you've just watched a collection of platitudes dressed up as an intellectual discovery. People who are smart enough to understand its supposed message don't need to watch it; the others won't have a clue anyway.

That Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise joined in on this triple take on the War on Terror doesn't make the film any more interesting, it just keeps you wondering when the movie is going to take off. Well, it doesn't, unless your form of entertainment centers around long rants about war and politics. It offers nothing new about the war on terror or its politics that hasn't been said by dozens of other bleeding heart liberals over the last several years.

Meryl Streep comes the closest to actually creating a real character in her role as a TV reporter, but interviewing a miscast and unconvincing Cruise as a US Senator lends no credence to her part in this civics lecture disguised as a film.

Robert Redford, one of the film industry's leading liberal voices, returns to the director's chair for the first time in seven years (2000's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Bagger-Vance/dp/B00003CXI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Bagger Vance</a>&nbsp;was his last) with this 2007 drama written as a three-pronged polemic by Matthew Michael Carnahan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kingdom/dp/B000Y7WGOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kingdom</a>). Carnahan's intentionally didactic screenplay is full of eloquent arguments, but the film's structure points to the movie's chief limitation, which is that the characters are only there to present opposing points of view. The net effect feels more like a civics lesson, especially for two of the three plot threads. The third attempts to translate those political arguments to the actual war zone, but somehow, the night scenes on an isolated hilltop don't make the impact necessary to make the rest of the film resonate.

The first storyline consists of an interview and ensuing debate between charismatic Senator Jasper Irving, a defiantly pro-war Republican hawk on an obvious Presidential track, and Janine Roth, a veteran, Lesley Stahl-like journalist he personally chose to reveal a new offensive the U.S. military is taking in Afghanistan against the Taliban. Their thrust-and-parry conversation is the best part of the movie, but it leads to the weakest part, a meltdown Roth has with her editor over the way the media shapes public opinion on the war without taking any responsibility to end it. The second plot thread involves an early-morning conversation between Professor Stephen Malley, a liberal academic teaching political science, and Todd Hayes, an obviously bright but disaffected student. They uncover Todd's reasons for apathy which stirs Malley to motivate the young slacker toward activism on any scale. The third storyline ties Malley to two former students, Ernest Rodriguez and Arian Finch, best friends both on scholarship, who heed the professor's advice by enlisting. This troubles Malley deeply, and the two are subsequently sent to Afghanistan to be part of the offensive described by Irving in the first storyline.

Tom Cruise is ideally cast as Irving since he has already proven he can convey pending malevolence with surprising conviction. As Roth, Meryl Streep is solid even as the script makes periodic pokes at her character's age. As an actor, Redford appears terrifically engaged as Malley, blurring the line between actor and character to maximum effect. Derek Luke, Michael Pe&ntilde;a and Andrew Garfield are effective in the younger roles. Mark Isham's stirring score is a good match for the gravity of the subject. Even though it's clear that Carnahan's screenplay is designed to raise more questions than it answers, the movie feels strangely incomplete, overly calculated and predictably emphatic despite the earnest intentions. To Redford's credit, the movie doesn't take sides, but it doesn't really finish making a compelling case toward political activism either. His meticulous commentary track is the chief extra on the 2008 DVD, as Redford goes through not only production details but also plot points with precision. There is also a twenty-minute featurette, ""The Making of Lions for Lambs"" which follows the movie from script to casting to production. All the principal actors are featured, as well as Redford and Carnahan. There is a second featurette, ""From Script to Screen"", which seems redundant with the first in specifically covering the script development. There are also a couple trailers for the film and a seven-minute retrospective on the United Artists studio.",1212364800,2,4226,5.926229508196721

It is truly bad, and preachy like almost nothing else.  For most of the movie, I didn't understand Redford's professor character and the scenes in Afghanistan [what you can see of them] are student-movie quality.  Tom Cruise, basing his smile intensive 'performance' on John Edwards, is completely unbelievable.  Meryl Streep, being the pro that she is, tries to bring some intensity to an unplayable character, but only in the single scene with her editor does the movie come to life.

There are numerous continuity gaffes, and how does Tom Cruise's Senator Irving, who claims that he graduated at the top of his class from West Point, have a diploma from Harvard?  Three of us watched this together.  When the movie ended, we collectively yelled, 'That's it?'  Much ado about not much.

3260846,2,B000YDJG0I,"""Lions for Lambs"" joins a raft of recent movies exploring the fallout over the war with Iraq.  The subject matter is timely, and this movie has a few interesting things to say about the war and how Americans view politics.  Unfortunately, the movie is so poorly directed and the characters so stock that it ends up failing to make the intended impact.  The all-star cast includes Tom Cruise as a smug young Republican Senator, Meryl Streep as a smug liberal-leaning reporter, Robert Redford as a smug big-thinking Professor, and newcomer British actor Andrew Garfield as a smug, lazy liberal arts student.  Well you get the point.  The characters could hardly be more caricature-like, which greatly waters down the message of the movie.

Message movies can be powerful in advancing political and sociological ideas, as witnessed by recent successes such as ""Crash"" and ""Babel.""  Unfortunately, whatever substance ""Lions for Lambs"" has is lost in its overly talky, didactic script.  The movie really consists of three intermixed scenes.  Tom Cruise's character gives an exclusive military scoop to Meryl Streep, who plays the most argumentative reporter in history.  After 5 minutes of arguing with her, a real Senator would show her to the door.  In the second scene, Robert Redford's professor tries to motivate one of his slacker students to really, really care.  These two conversations comprise the bulk of the movie along with what seems at first to be unrelated scenes of a military strike in the Middle East.  Gradually, the dots are connected to explain the relevance of the military section of the plot.  This part of the movie is genuinely affecting at time, helped greatly by solid acting by Michael Pena (Crash, Babel) and Derek Luke (Antwone Fisher).  Indeed, this section of the movie should have been expanded; instead, it became the epitome of liberal guilt, sadly undercutting its ultimate effectiveness.

""Lions for Lambs"" is not a terrible movie.  It speeds along quickly and is relatively watchable.  However, what it aims for and what it attains are so disparate as to detract greatly, depending on the individual viewer, from what good things one may take from the movie.  Plus, Redford really doesn't aim high enough for the film to take the title of ""noble failure.""  Excoriating Republicans for being hawkish and taking the press for task for buying into hype aren't exactly going to win you any prizes for originality.",1210896000,6,2444,5.0625
3260847,3,B000YDJG0I,"You know those movies that you watch, and find so compelling you say to people `you HAVE to see this movie...'?  Well, this movie aims for that, but alas merely reaches the heights of `Yeah, it's worth watching...'.
The film revolves around 3 storylines, essentially taking place simultaneously, and in real time, but this structure is not religiously adhered to as there are also some flashbacks.  In Washington, a senior Senator rumored to be a potential Presidential candidate, invites a respected journalist from a major TV news network, to give her an exclusive on the latest tactics being used in Afghanistan.  Meanwhile, that push is shown through the eyes of two soldiers in the Special Forces, as the mission goes wrong and they are stuck behind enemy lines.  The final strand is in a University, as the professor Robert Redford talks to a student full of potential but with more than enough cynicism and apathy to go with it.  He shares his experience with the story of the two Special Forces soldiers, who were students of his and left to `go make a difference'.
It's a movie brimming with talent to be sure, with Robert Redford directing and Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep acting their socks off..  Cruise does give a compellingly convincing portrayal of a senior politician, convinced of his moral high ground but using it to further his career as much or if not more than doing the right thing.  Streep also gives a performance which at times seems just a little too self consciously rounded, when something stripped down to basics would have done just as well.  Her tics and mannerisms would have been better served in a movie which focused on her character.  Redford is.. well, simply Redford.
The script, when we hear the characters debating with each other (which is most of the movie - don't go expecting an action flick whatever you do..) is intelligent and gets across its message clearly enough.  Engagement is needed - apathy is a recipe for disaster, whether it be apathy on an individuals part or on the part of the media.  Clumsy parallels to Vietnam are made.  However, we don't have time to warm to any of the characters, neither are arcs to the characters developed, such that the movie ultimately feels like a lecture - something that a documentary could have done as well - or even better, using actual facts instead of drama.
Worth watching for some good performances and literate script, but should have been much more.  How did such interesting talent combine to make such a mediocre product - is making a statement on war so much at odds with good film-making these days?",1210723200,,2603,4.757777777777778

Putting aside their possible salaries, it is also one of the cheapest to produce you can imagine (except perhaps for the battle set). Even if it were made more cheaply, it is hard to imagine that its drama would have suffered.

The typical Hollywood line is ""If you want to send a message, call Western Union."" And this is nothing if not a message film. But that hardly detracts from its mounting excitement, as the three diverse storylines begin to come together. It's not just about a message you see. It's about a lost message. It's like the parable of the mustard seed, which can fall on stony or on fertile ground, or the message for ears if you have them.

And in a way, it's about Redford's own arc of creativity with getting out a message, from Three Days of the Condor to All the President's Men to The Way We Were.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Days-of-the-Condor/dp/6305511055/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Days of the Condor</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-the-President-s-Men-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000CEXEWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All the President's Men (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Way-We-Were-Special-Edition/dp/B00001W9G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Way We Were (Special Edition)</a>. This one is about the corrupted message, passed by a messenger (Streep) who has sold out to the tabloid magnates.  In the previous works, most notably All the President's Men, you got the feel that it was about knowing the truth and having it set you free. But this is more about incuriosity about the truth, and how much easier it is to ignore it and enjoy your own little playpen.

Professor Malley (Redford) plays a professor at the what could be UCLA, but with the tuition stated, more likely USC. He has a meeting with a non-performing student, a frat boy. There is an immediate rapport between them and you can well believe in the Redford's character having once been at a similar place in his young life, albeit threatened in those days by the Vietnam draft. Malley once had two other students, who are now in Afghanistan. They were more hard-working, coming as they did from LA ghettos where blacks and Hispanics experience far more violence than the white frat boy could imagine. While the frat boy is, for the moment, free to live his own life, the former students are currently the ""lions for lambs"", the playthings of fate.

That fate is foreshadowed by the ambitions of a senator hoping to run for president, Tom Cruise, who believes that he can provide a way to victory in the place which has never been conquerable from Alexander the Great to the Soviet Union, and which is now contested between warlords, the Taliban and the US and allies. Whatever happens, the former students of Professor Malley, are there and very much in harm's way. Cruise does not break a sweat as he implements the policy of the executive branch, between cell phone calls and his interview with formerly distinguished journalist Meryl Streep (now a person reduced to a narrow crawl space while Spears and Fetterline command the evening news and a bleached blond with a rack holds court). You have the feeling that Streep is in hell (even her thermostat at the studio is set too high for comfort). She rode a wave once of enthusiasm for policies she never took the time to understand. It was easer to sell them than to confront their inventors with questions. Having become a seller, it is impossible now to become a truth-seeker.

In the end, it is about the generation which slumbers, whether lions or lambs. It is about their lulling by all the cunning devices of the media, while their fates will one day, you can imagine, be held in the well-manicured hands of French-cuffed Cruise, their future absolute monarch. He is an expert at military intelligence, he says, having graduated first in his class at West Point. But he has never seen combat.

His future minions have many toys they have not yet taken from the upper shelf (Streep), but at a word, they will be able to do so, if his party leader's latest cock-up can be spun using the heroism of Malley's former students as a recruiting tool.

If there is a Deep Throat in this story, it is Streep, whose crawl space should be stretched to fill the whole screen, expelling the tacky tabloid amusement for what she really knows, and when she knew it. But until the customers quit drugging on the fluff, that cannot happen. Anyway, she's 57, and she has fatrolls rather than a rack. Will the frat boys watch?",1210377600,5,4724,5.118028534370946

It is a fictitious conversation, where the screenwriter can manipulate the conversation in any way he wants (as it is with all screenplays).  The dialogue in this movie is carefully crafted and controlled for political purposes.  It is propaganda.  Now, both sides of an issue have propaganda.  Propaganda is not bad.  But this movie supposes to speak for both sides of an issue, when in reality it speaks only for one.  The liberal agenda is just as apparent when Irving is speaking as it is when Roth is speaking.

So who are the heroes in this film? The soldiers and...the media. As director Robert Redford tells it; the media take the twisted lies and propaganda that the right-wing politicians are spewing and straighten it out to the stories that we read in the paper. Alright, great.

Meryl Streep plays the reporter, who was one of the people who fell prey to the ""terrible lies"" that followed the 9/11 terrorist attacks regarding who was responsible. She is interviewing Tom Cruise, a politician who the audience is obviously supposed to dislike.

Here's the problem(s).

This is a propoganda piece! Now, propoganda isn't neccasarily bad, but Streep's climatic rant toward the end of the film makes a valid point against the film itself. When questioned why she doesn't want to print the story given by Cruise's character, Streep says that ""all he gave was propoganda."" In other words, she argued that she wouldn't be printing NEWS, she would be printing a piece of biased propoganda. That is essentially what this movie is.

This is not a debate for a certain view...it is mere propoganda masquerading as a provocotive look at the debate behind the Iraq War. When you can make your opponent say whatever you want so that you can come up with some clever retort, it isn't exatly valid debate.

Bottom line; Do not be fooled...this is Redford's bitter views spun into an angering propoganda piece. The very politicians he condemns may be more like him than he thinks...",1209859200,17,1840,4.881410256410256
3260855,3,B000YDJG0I,"*** 2007. Directed by Robert Redford. The subject is the Irak and the Afghanistan wars seen through the eyes of a journalist, a politician, a teacher, a student and two soldiers. With the exception of some school or army scenes, LIONS FOR LAMBS presents only dialogues between two characters expressing their points of views. The concept is interesting and honorable but very frustrating for a viewer not particularly fond of ex cathedra lectures. As usual, this kind of film will please those of you admiring the ideas of the director and the screenwriter and hurt the others unless they are convinced by the arguments. Redford's intentions are laudable because, after all, his model, Plato's dialogues, are high points of the world literature but one mustn't forget that these books were meant to be read by educated people only while motion pictures are destined to a larger audience who is waiting to be entertained and not moralized.

3260857,4,B000YDJG0I,"I was impressed by this little movie.  Robert Redford is known for films that have that ""what if?"" or ""you decide"" quality to them.  A bit philosophical.  A bit exposition.  Very nice work in this short character piece.

The script is very well written, the acting is great, and the characters hold no punches in expressing their viewpoints.  It's representative of what's going on today and at the same time the writer is sending an obvious message, as I would expect writers to do.

Judging by the reviews of the movie thus far, you will notice how this movie does and does not strike a chord with viewers.  This film was never expected to be a blockbuster hit, but it is certainly a thinking film.  Some will have an opinion towards it.  Some will have no reaction to the film at all.  I can't help but feel the film has made its point.

3260859,1,B000YDJG0I,"At first glance, you'd think that Lions for Lambs would be a good movie:  after all, it stars Tom Cruise, Robert Redford and Meryl Streep, all reasonably decent actors, and is directed by Redford, who's received acclaim for some of his past directorial efforts.  Unfortunately, it is a tedious, preachy film that seems more designed to deliver a message than to entertain; it winds up doing neither well.

There are three distinct storylines going on, all taking place over a period of an hour in different regions of the world.  In California, Robert Redford is a political science professor debating an apathetic student about political activism during the former's office hours.  There is no plot, just a bunch of back-and-forth arguing.  Meanwhile, two of Redford's former students - who actually followed his call to participate, though not in the way he intended - are now Special Forces soldiers trapped on a mountaintop in Afghanistan after a mission went wrong.  This is the only storyline that is minimally interesting, probably because it is the only one with any real action in it.

The third storyline involves a Republican senator played by Tom Cruise giving an interview to reporter Meryl Streep.  The purpose of their meeting is to unveil the purpose of the Afghanistan mission, which Cruise does not yet know has gone wrong.  The interview, however, turns into a debate about the United States's efforts in the Middle East, and it is grating to watch.  The attempt to provide a semblance of balance fails:  Cruise's pro-war stance is so filled with cliched lines - and he comes off too glib - that he is utterly unbelievable.  Streep isn't much better on her side.

From a political standpoint, I actually agree with a lot of what this movie says, but it does it so poorly that it undermines its own cause.  I often say I can enjoy a good book or movie even if I disagree with its politics, as long as it's done well; similarly, I can hate a book or movie that I agree with if it's done bad, as this one is.  Whether you are for or against the Iraq war, this movie should be avoided.",1209254400,30,2100,4.6811989100817435
3260860,1,B000YDJG0I,"This movie had a lot of potential, it had a really good premise and could have been a really good movie but it failed miserably.

The #1 problem with this movie was that the producer/director did not do their homework. By that, I mean ALL the military aspects of this movie were laughable (I literally laughed where inappropriate). I won't point out all the mistakes, I'm not someone who does that. I don't want to spoil anything so just know when you're watching, that two ""American"" soldiers, especially Army Special Forces would NEVER do what these two do at the end, its insulting for those of us who are over here fighting right now that people will believe that.

The other BIG problem with this movie was the script, not the story or even the screenplay but the dialogue itself. Watching this was like sitting through a liberal Political Science lecture.  The movie was almost painful to sit through, and at just over 90 minutes thats really saying something.  Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep are two of the best actors alive and in this movie, I could tell they were acting. I didn't believe he was a senator and I didn't believe she was a reporter. Cruise and Streep did their best with the script and the direction they were given, but all in all this movie was just BAD.

If you're looking for a GOOD movie about Afghanistan and why we're still here, watch ""Charlie Wilson's War"" It blows this movie out of the water.",1209254400,14,1424,4.546875
3260861,3,B000YDJG0I,"For the actual cinematic qualities, see Roland E. Zwick's excellent review.  Short version:  it doesn't work all that well, because it is dry and wooden.

OK, so the medium is lacking.  What about the message?

Well, you get to review bad war leadership decisions from the Bush administration.  Who knew?

In the Streep/Cruise thread, Cruise very much ends up being the straw man, but gets to put his case across very eloquently.  Merryl Streep often challenges him, but without pressing her arguments (hint: she's doing it for the audience).  When she does really object, it is not with him, but rather with her news manager.  I guess a central point Cruise makes would be hard to answer:  what would exactly happens if the US cuts and runs now?

And that's the whole weakness on the foreign policy side:  it criticizes but doesn't manage to even try to articulate an answer.  Or indeed even ask novel and important questions, as it doesn't rise much above canned, though valid, criticism.

Where it does come up with its own ideas, through Redford's character, it proposes a woolly, likely useless agenda about an in-USA-Peace-Corps that has absolutely nothing to do with Afghanistan/Iraq.  And it laments the supposed stupidity, ignorance and apathy of the voters.  Original that.  And with just a whiff of elitism.

In the end, the best thing about the movie is its title.  It refers to WWI German soldiers admiring the doomed courage of British soldiers at the Battle of the Somme, while they were lead by an incompetent top leadership.  That pretty much summarizes Iraq and Afghanistan 6 years on, though the failures are much less at the military than at the political level.

I applaud Robert Redford for trying to wake folks up, but this ain't 'Apocalypse Now', 'Deer Hunter' or even 'Three Kings' in terms of cinema quality or mass appeal.  As a result, its audience and its effects will be limited.",1209168000,,1909,4.842105263157895
3260862,3,B000YDJG0I,"I enjoyed my High School Goverment class with eyes that made it fun,so,here me out...

""Lions for Lambs"" does have very strong potential-that very strong potential standing on top of the importance that it covers. It is a film dealing with all of the issues of our current Goverment. Take a look at how ""Lions for Lambs"" deals with the Iraq war...and the flak that both senators and journalists deal with...and you can find it all here. A good education,right?

The answer to that question is right:halfway right. With ""Lions for Lambs"",Robert Redford(the first person to knock the Oscar out of Martin Scorsese's hands,I might add)does a very good job at taking three seperate lives(a Senator,a TV journalist,and a professor)and blending them all into one(Redford's character is just a connection to the characters of Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep-you'll see the connection and what I mean). What these three characters deal with and how they get entangled in what is blamed on the Government and the Bush administration-does show the world we live in today(more,though,if you are against the war in Iraq-this is not a film for Iraq war supporters). Robert Redford does open viewers' eyes more a little bit to the career of a senator and a journalist in this current world. That,right there,is very positive and gives ""Lions for Lambs"" a strong,metal ground to stand on.

The main problem,though,is that ""Lions for Lambs""(aside from what I already mentioned)is nothing about the Gov. we don't know already. The stuff that doesn't open our eyes and make us understand is what has been running in the headlines. It's the basis of the majority of ""Lions for Lambs"". And,unfortunately,""Lions for Lambs"" does become slow and boring in getting its required expression out not too long after the film has settled in(and that's most of the film). Had LFL been kept at its required pace(Robert Redford and Meryl Streep themselves claimed that they had several problems on the set with Tom Cruise that caused this damage)and been kept at a good and even balance,the news of today might have a little more life summarized better. Remember that ten to twenty years from now,when ""Lions for Lambs"" will be the past headlines of a very important and controverisal time in history(with a lot of resemblance to Vietnam,as we already know).

Worth a look,and don't ignore it because of Tom Cruise-but be prepared of the dominating detours that are too be found here.",1208476800,,2447,4.9755501222493885

Except for the little bit of action when the soldiers in Iraq are faced with a huge crisis, the rest is pretty much talk, talk and talk all the way to the end.

The movie is seperated in 3 different scenarios, which in reality, are all part of the same situation... a few specific soldiers dealing with war in Iraq.

There are better movies out there concerning this issue with a more intelligent and entertaining script. You can easily skip this one.",1208217600,2,586,4.36697247706422
3260864,5,B000YDJG0I,"Based on the reviews thus far, the following is clear:

If you are still a Republican after all that has happened, then this movie won't change your mind... it'll just make you mad.  Check out numbersusa, and do something constructive with your time (honestly, that's a more appropriate place to vent your frustration).  Save us your brash negative review.

If you are looking for SAS entertainment, and want to avoid a mental challenge, then that's sad, but this movie is not your cup-of-tea.

If you are anti-intellectual (or the new buzz-phrase: anti-""elitist"") and/or cynical to the point where you abhor any type of strong opinion on controversial matters, then your mind will filter out the meaning, and you will only hear garbled chatter.  That's really a shame, because this movie is largely about--and directed at--YOU.  The movie's modality is not in tune with your way of thinking, so chances are very high that you will not like it.

If you are under about 15 years old (less for girls), then this movie is probably too weighty for you.  If you still think it's cool to be smart, and you pride your intellect, then you might give it a try.

All other personality types should see this movie, and try hard to stick with it, because it's important that you ""get it.""  The Socratic Method is at work here, so it may take a while to digest.  The movie will challenge your intellect, and there is no doubt that it is politically polarizing.  The movie is largely a dialog from multiple points of view, so you won't agree with everything... the important thing is that you understand the movie in its totality.

It's a shame that many people seek to exclude themselves--and others--from civil discourse about the issues presented by writing such brash reviews.  I'm sure thousands of potential viewers are being scared away by this insidious tactic.  Robert Redford has been a champion of the little guy ever since The Milagro Beanfield War.  He is at his most poignant here in L4L.  Unless you are a complete ditto-head, this movie deserves your support [""ambivalence only helps the oppressor""].

3260866,2,B000YDJG0I,"Barely a 2 and I won't be buying it.  OK, where do I start?  First and foremost, I believe that this movie gave very little technical realism to the military side of the equation.  Once again, we're portrayed as macho idiots (or lambs) that are saluting smartly and doing the bidding of senseless Republican war-mongers who do ""whatever it takes.""  The technical aspects of the military mission were laughable.  Anyone that falls or jumps out of a helicopter 100 feet above mountainous terrain is going to DIE.  Yet, one of our college heroes falls out and the other jumps out so that ""no man is left behind"" and they survive the fall into a snow bank on a flat part of the mountain pass.  Next, Hollywood shows us that we can see our good guys with the bad guy ""Talies"" approaching via satellite imagery through a blinding snow storm at night...right.  So, we watch our intrepid heroes fight off some of the advance of some 20-30 enemy while having little or no terrain as cover.  Why are our heroes not killed outright?....We are told that the Taliban want to take them alive.  OK, maybe plausible, but unlikely.  Next, our A-10 support arrives and bombs the crap out of the FLOT (forward line of troops) at least two or three times.  Initially our heroes hope that all have been vanquished, but then suffer further small arms fire from the dark only yards away.  What do they decide?  Do they decide to try to hold on for what everyone knows will be the rescue attempt?  NOOOOOO.  Damn it.  They stand up and go out in a suicide blaze of fire because they believe all is lost.  CRAP!  Seconds later the remaining Taliban are exterminated in the final A-10 pass and the rescue helicopter only a couple of minutes away.  I was so angry I could spit.  The rest of the movie is what you would expect from Robert Redford, another lecture on his view of American politics and right wing wrongs.  Where do these people get their military technical consultation, the Salvation Army?",1208131200,9,1977,4.572649572649572
3260867,4,B000YDJG0I,"Another reviewer at Amazon notes 'it's about getting off your butt', while another here notes 'this isn't for short attention span viewers', and yet... I'm not sure either of those points are quite right about this film.

This film is a complex tale with writing that seems to be from the same school as say The West Wing, or Sports Night, or the later Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.  No, this wasn't an Aaron Sorkin tale, but it seems that way, and if you watch the extras and listen to the writer's own words, and those of the actors and actresses that brought those words to life, you see that style very clearly (if you didn't already pick up on it).  Given what the writer seemed to be going for, and what the actors and actresses (and director Robert Redford), they all seem to have delivered, but then the question becomes what have they really delivered?

This isn't an anti-war picture, but at the same time it is most certainly not a film that glorifies war or places the military on a pedestal.  Far from it, the military and political leadership rightfully catches blame for the mishandling of the war in Afghanistan.  We're 'treated to' seeing the results of the poor leadership, poor intelligence, and poor planning as it plays out over roughly one third of this film in the form of two special forces soldiers on a mission gone bad.

While those events are unfolding 'in real time', we're also looking in at an interview (also occuring in real time) between an aging reporter (played by Meryl Streep) and a young 'hot shot' politician (played by Tom Cruise).  The dialog and banter between Streep and Cruise is crisp and quick, though there isn't the talking over other players that happens quite frequently in the Aaron Sorkin products noted above.  As the interview unfolds, and then is looked at later when Streep goes back to the offices of her big media/entertainment company employer, we learn that Streep wasn't happy with the answers she got from Cruise.  She is placed in a bit of a dilemma as her bosses presses her to take the story she was given and run with it while she feels much less inclined to actually run the story.

Finally, while those events have been unfolding in real time, we get the last of events that are also unfolding in a real time as the political science professor played by Robert Redford is having an early morning meeting with an apparent slacker student who holds a lot of promise but just can't seem to engage himself in Redford's classes any more.

The film moves back and forth between events in Afghanistan, to the Congressman's office in D.C., to the University in California and as we see flashbacks of past events in the professor's class we find that we are seeing a pair of individuals there who are now heavily involved in events in Afghanistan.

What is the message of the film?  Is there even one particular message?  Certainly that 'get off your butt and get involved' message is there, but that isn't the only message and if it was just that message trying to come through in this film there are other films that would seem to do a much better job of passing along that message (see Pay It Forward as an example).

Perhaps the message is that politicians are idiots?  Maybe, but again other films would seem to do a better job at telling and showing us that to be the case.

Maybe the message is that the news media that have been there and done that are smarter than everyone else and know what will and won't work as they see through the semantics and re-invention of older military strategies that are being brought up by the hot-shot politicians and the military brass.

After the fact, the lack of the single message and the complexity of the film may be what hurts the film the most, or at least hurts the film with most potential viewers.  While I rated the film at 4 stars in my review, it is more in the 3-1/2 star range for me (curse you for not allowing 1/2 star ratings Amazon.com!), and I can certainly see where it would be a 2 star (or worse) snooze fest for many or even a 5 star masterpiece for others.  I wish it was a bit easier to consume, but then again do people really want to be beat over the head with the messages and morals from the writers/directors/actors?

3260869,5,B000YDJG0I,"I recently finished my second degree. I am in the military. I watch the ""news"" and even care about politics a bit. A lot of people will not 'get' this movie (clearly, when reading some of the other reviews).

It wasn't supposed to be another Hollywood entertainment piece without substance. And it is not preaching anything. What Robert Redford does do here, is point out the apathy and ignorance of many Americans who chose to takes the path of least resistance in life, while others fight around the world for what they believe in. While they continue to die, we are microwaving our TV dinners at home. (THINK about it).

In addition, the film highlights current political agendas, corporate cultures and consumerism in the news rooms, where political propagandas are transferred from politicians to TV without commentary or (valuable) discussion. (Fox news is not valuable discussion, in case you didn't know. Neither is the daily show by the way!).

The ""news"" as it stands today, is really a part of the entertainment industry, rather than researched perspective and political engagement. Dead soldiers in Iraq are talked about in the same segment as Anna Nicole Smith's baby and Paris Hilton's dog. Americans in particular (ok, not ALL of them for you nitpickers out there), have a 2 minute attention span when it comes to serious news, so the news agencies have to package it into an entertainment format. If you're offended now, you're probably one of them...

The film touches on other aspects of current happenings, like America's standing in the world and our place within America. This is an excellent film that many people will chose to overlook or undersell, because it is hard to admit that the criticism of the film is directed to the viewer, you.

I won't go into military operation inaccuracies, but they are there, and there's plenty for even the casual observer to notice.
I gave this movie two stars, because deep beneath the thunderous anti-war drums, behind the rosy red lens from which Hollywood (Robert Redford in particular) is able to understand military planning and global strategy with a deftness envied by all, and buried beneath a pile of propaganda that would make the most skilled spin doctor proud, is a singular lesson which makes some of this redeemable.

Each time, my response is the same -- I am back in the late 60s marching and leafletting and doing everything I can to end the stupid war this country stumbled into. I am energized and purposeful and working for something I believed was important. And, ultimately, I am thrilled when my actions and those of millions of others, ended that war.
The current war is just one in a series of stupid mistakes. Mistakes that keep getting made because we the people don't make OUR views known. We don't make them known in the voting booths nor by continued vigilance. And so we get what we get -- we get smarmy politicians with no sense of the past who just want to make a name for themselves no matter how many people may get hurt; we get journalists who were so traumatized by 9/11 that they were not able to be our watchdogs and warn us when bad decisions were made; we get teachers and professors who are saddened by rather than inspired by their students; and we get young people who have watched us all turn to TV as a panacea instead of turning off the TV and getting involved.
Seemed to me very clear that the Iraq non-war was a place to set this movie, rather then the point of it.

3260884,4,B000YDJG0I,"LIONS FOR LAMBS as a movie has the courage to do just what the message of the film attempts to do: encourage the American public to stop being so apathetic about our position in the global community.  The dramatization of three points of view about the Middle East conflicts (it not only takes on the Iraq debacle, but adds the Afghanistan and Iran problems as well) could, in lesser hands than Robert Redford's direction of Matthew Michael Carnahan's script, be a preachy bore.  But while the 'action' of the film may not grab the viewer, the afterburn of the message will haunt the thinking person.

Three scenarios interweave (at times a bit bumpy in the editing, and at times a bit distracting): adamantly pro-war Republican Senator Irving (Tom Cruise) is interviewed by veteran 'thinking' journalist Janine Roth (Meryl Streep) and each defends/attacks the current strategy of the war in Iraq (Irving is taking calls about the latest 'expansion' into Afghanistan); Professor Malley (Robert Redford) tries to resurrect a sense of involvement in a student Todd Hayes (Andrew Garfield) once bright but now sinking into the apathy of living the good life; ex-students of Professor Malley - Arian Finch (Derek Luke) and Ernesto Rodriguez (Michael Pea) - have committed to the idea of acting for change and have ended up being dropped in Afghanistan in the very 'new' war Senator Irving is addressing.  By stirring these three approaches to the manner in which the public is  currently addressing the war in Iraq in a concurrent conversation, the film involves the viewer in the crossfire of apathy and misinformation that come from failed education, faulty governmental intervention and the media sellout to get ratings.  It is not a pretty picture, but then our current state of affairs is not one of which we can be proud.

There are no answers here, just harsh realities and questions as to why  we can remain so passive as a nation involved in the lowest state of global respect ever known. The film has flaws, but if the viewer can digest the information illustrated by some very fine acting, perhaps there may be a chance for a wake-up call.

This movie had the potential to be one of the greatest movies, ever.

Such an intelligent script (so, so rare these days), high powered cast, perceptive, meaningful conjecture. Even, Shakespearean.

However...

Tom Cruise: He wasn't so much smarmy (previous review) as he was slick... his smile a little too broad and beautiful, his eyes a little too bright. The part demanded an ageless jadedness, downplayed frustration, sublimated passion oozing from the edges of world weary Congressional soullessness.

He deserves credit for being able to deliver such long winded passages in a convincing, conversational style. There needed to be more closeups, more subtle facial emotion from him. Something roiling beneath.

Smart Student: The actor who portrayed the bright but cynical, blas&eacute; student was terribly miscast. He was unable to plumb the true wealth inherent within this character.

His part was crucial, diametrically oppositional to the core premises of this movie. It demanded a student-type whom you might scoff, deride, ridicule at first; but, in the end, brings you to sympathetic understanding. This part had the power to mesmerize, captivate, motivate.

But, no. Didn't do.

It was as if everyone was a bit tired.

Meryl Streep: She didn't seem to have her full, amazing heart enmeshed in her part as she usually does. Even a bit insipid, disinterested, at times. Here is a newswoman who has been able to maintain a passion for honesty. A special newswriter, indeed. Meryl could have taken this to the nth.

Redford: He was convincing as an ivory towered ennui'd prof who skims the surface of, rather than engages, life.

The two military students: These two actors started off bland, unlikeable. However... they blossomed. In fact, they eventually grew to magnificent stature. They so ably were able their character's perspectives on War, on true nobility of spirit.

They are the true stars, these relative unknowns. They captured the heart.

This movie is good enough to watch over and over, so it is a buy.

But, some people today might not have the staying power to stick through it, having become used to flash, pop and sizzle of small meaningless sound bites that seem to prevail.

Very well done.

This movie was made with several intentions in mind, unfortunately the general public is all too quick to pick a side and they miss the point of the film entirely.

You have all aspects of politicians in this movie you have the senator (Tom Cruise) GOP baby moving up in the ranks, trying to make his mark.  You have the Liberal Professor (Redford) and you have the voice to the sheep of the country the media (Streep.)

For those of you that stated it is one sided I don't know how many more sides you need because that is what the War is about.  Everyone is fed exactly what they need to eat, nothing more, nothing less it is up to the individual to determine if they like the taste.

This was an excellent movie about how America is losing its place in the world concerning itself with the Middle East.  The people in that region will never change.  They have been that way for thousands of years and America is not special.  We will lose the war because they will not quit and we are so arrogant we can't pick up a History book and realize that this is the way it is and that is it.

I am a soldier and I can tell you this because my friends have died there, are serving there and I support the War Effort as well in Europe taking care of the Men and Women that get sent to the slaughter by our Politicians and Government that don't give a damn about their people.  When this is over do you really think that the families of the 4,000 soldiers will get this overwhelming sigh ""well my child's life was sacrificed for something and I am glad they laid down their life....""  C'mon!?

The movie made a great statement at the end with the complete apathy of the college student because that sums it up, people would rather watch a meaningless melodrama then care about what is happening in the world because everyone has become so desensitized to everything.  It is like walking around in a coma.",1207612800,4,1984,4.295698924731183
3260887,1,B000YDJG0I,"I should have known better given that the film was directed by Redford, but I decided to give it a shot.  I suppose at the end of the day, Redford did not ""disappoint"" as he gave what should expect from him: good acting and left-wing lectures.  It would have been nice if the film makers actually put in a little more plot and action to help the non-Daily Kos-reading audience members wash down the rhetoric (kind of how a spoon full of sugar makes the medicine go down), but I suppose the choir will be happy.

Here's what the movie's messages boil down to: Bush and the GOP are ""iredeemable,"" dumb, uncaring about the soldiers because they never faught in the infantry (although serving in infantry combat was a prerequisite to compassion for the soldiers, one wonders where the movie maker's supposed compassion comes from), and liars.  You can't believe anything the government says about the War on Terror, so instead, you should take a cynical attitude that everything is a lie, or you should spin your own conspiracy theories about the true intentions of the government, even in the absence of any evidence (as the Meryl Streep reporter character wants to do).  The soldiers who fight are laudable, but they're really dieing for a bunch of lies.  Iraq and Afganistan are just two more Vietnams that we should pull out from (because the War on Terror again, is just a powergrab by the GOP).  Finally, it's the public's apathy that is really at fault for the damage to our country because we should have known that Bush et al were just a bunch of evil, opportunistic, warmongerers.

The acting is really the only positive of this movie.  Redford, Streep, Cruise, and the guys who play the trapped soldiers all do good jobs.  I have to think that Cruise's performance is especially noteworthy, as he must have wanted to throw up in his mouth while playing a hawkish Republican Senator.",1207440000,17,1889,4.696969696969697
3260888,2,B000YDJG0I,"I started out watching this movie expecting to hate it. I'd heard all about how it was a one sided, liberal view of the ongoing war in the Middle East. Knowing Robert Redford's politics I expected nothing less. But then it pulled me in. That is until it summed up towards the end.

The movie has three converging stories that all meld into one. The first involves charismatic politician Senator Jasper Irving (Tom Cruise) who is giving a one on one interview with journalist Janine Roth (Meryl Streep). The interview is an attempt to get the press to work with Irving who is behind a new push in Afghanistan. While slick, Irving has to be the bad guy because we see news headlines about how the GOP is losing popularity (though our current congress is at an all time low in popularity and not run by the GOP) and pictures of him with everyone from President Bush to Condeleza Rice.

The second story revolves around a college student (Andrew Garfield) and his political science teacher (Redford). Redford sees great potential in this student who has a come what may attitude towards life. To convince him of his potential, Redford tells him the story of two other students, our third story.

The other two students are Ernest Rodriguez (Michael Pena) and Arian Finch (Derek Luke), a Mexican American and black American, who got where they were in school via scholarships. They have chosen to join the armed forces to take a stand and try and change things from the inside. Both are involved in this new push and have been stranded behind enemy lines in Afghanistan.

Each of these stories revolves around one simple idea. That the war in the Middle East is wrong and has been wrong and always will be wrong. Granted it never says this statement out loud, but that IS what the central story is about.

It's also about the choices we make and how they affect more than ourselves. Choices to stand for what we believe, to sit back and watch the world go by, to enhance an already volatile situation or to offer up a truth spun to us rather than seek the reality behind the story. Unfortunately for this film, it tries to represent each side of the story using only one.

An intellectual discussion on the topic would find merit in both sides because in truth it exists. But this movie espouses to do so while propagandizing only one. Each point of view made is done so with nothing more than the same rhetoric used over and over again to make a case. An example: the current war we find ourselves in is NOT Vietnam and never will be no matter how hard people want to draw comparisons. No two wars are alike no matter how many people want them to be. But this movie falls back on that comparison on more than one occasion.

The film is well made, don't get me wrong. It looks tremendous. The acting is top notch (with the exception of Streep who never convinced me of her character). It feels like a great Hollywood movie. I began by enjoying it but ended feeling like I had heard this same story over and over again and always from someone unwilling to look at both sides of an issue. And that being what was trying to be told here made it a failure in so many ways.

If you buy into the rhetoric, you'll love this movie. If you don't, it will make you angry. And if you can at least, honestly, go into with an open mind, you'll walk away thinking perhaps they need more open minded people to make both sides heard.  This movie died at the box office. It's easy to see why.",1207440000,5,3470,4.434850863422292

3260891,3,B000YDJG0I,"This is not a Tom Cruise movie, nor is it a Meryl Streep movie and it's barely a Robert Redford movie. Frankly, Lions for Lambs is barely a ""movie"" at all and if you wish to enjoy it you mustn't think of it as such, let alone a blockbuster movie. L4L is best savoured as a pseudo-documentary, not quite like Inconvenient Truth, though not that far away either.

In fact, the film could really be named Inconvenient Talk or Inconvenient Topics, as it's really about, well, talking about tough topics with no clear consensus view - in politics, in education, in media about the role of America and Americans in the war on terror, in the classroom, in public knowledge, in government, as minorities, as the privileged and so on.

You've got Robert Redford, a professor trying to convince possibly his brightest student that there's more to life than just earning degrees and growing rich. His take on crises like the Iraqi war, possibly echoing Redford's personal view, is that the younger generation can't sit back and blame the hopeless politicians. The people of America have got to do something, although two other students of his take the view to (what he views as) an extreme position by actualling signing up to fight.

These two students - a Puerto Rican and Negro - also form the other key segment of the show, a snow-battle in the mountains of Afghanistan resulting from a very poorly planned US military op. This fiasco was in turn the brainchild of Senator Jasper Irving, played with boyish gusto by Tom Cruise, the poster child of American Republican politics who says all the right things and ducks most of the tough questions, and does both with a huge grin. Irving invites Meryl Streep's character, a journalist, to do an exclusive on the new military strategy and in the process engages in a tense debate on the failures and futures of American foreign policy in the context of the war on terror.

L4L is all about the arguments. Back forth back forth - it's one big plurivocal textbook played out in motion picturesque.

Should Americans be indifferent, should they apologise, should they curse the politicians (those who never say anything but never stop talking, and who keep repeating that, ""I am NOT running for President"") and ignore them, or should they take an active role which may involve sacrificing 'the good life' (of good colleges, high salaries and big walls)?

Should the United States pull its troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan and risk ""a shattered Iraq, a hopeless Afghanistan and a nuclear Iran""? Or should America continue to put their boys in the firing line, up the tempo and seek to annihilate the rebel forces and the 'Tali' (ban - get it?) once and for all? Are good and brave Americans who enlist for military action being stupid and throwing their futures away, like lions led by lambs? Or would it be better to seek alternative routes of engagement, until one is drafted into the army?

Can one disagree with another's patriotic actions whilst revering the other's reasons for them? (Can, in fact, motives and actions be so neatly separated?)

So you have professors, wise monkeys, counselling young lions not to be led to the slaughter by lambs like the Senators, themselves challenged by elephant-journalists with large memories - whilst the entire jungle is in crisis. Welcome to the circus of life. There are animals everywhere and no one's really sure what's happening, but everyone's hoping there'll be a happy ending. Before we all tear each other apart, limb from bloody limb.

A unique movie on political conversations, if ever one was made. Too bad Redford didn't get Cruise to get out of his office. That may have saved it from becoming a 'Ticking Tom Bomb'? As it stands, some scenes should serve well as an intro to a course or seminar of Political Science. Because too bad, no, I don't think your average movie-goer is going to want to spend a few good weekend hours or a tired post-work evening seeing movie-stars (albeit very famous ones) sit and talk.",1206748800,6,4012,4.769452449567724
3260892,4,B000YDJG0I,"Lions for Lambs was released to relatively disappointing results, under performing both critically and financially. In the end, it would make some money, more overseas than in America, but the fledgling United Artists had to be disappointed. It's too bad, if you ask me, that the film was so passed by. It's a relatively slowly paced, but the film has a real meaning to it. Some declared it to be preachy and generic, a liberal rant. But I strongly disagree. It's a much more fair meditation than it was portrayed, I went to theatre with extremely conservative friends, for example, and they were not offended.

The film follows three different stories, a moral conversation between a professor (Robert Redford) and his student, an 'information session' of sorts between a Senator (Tom Cruise) and a reporter (Meryl Streep), and two soldiers under fire in Afghanistan (Derek Luke and Crash's Michael Pena). The film moves in real time, creating a powerful impact, while Cruise and Meryl debate, the two men near death. The talk between Redford and the college boy feels real, and is thoughtful, a worthy reflection on our world today. The film attempted to portray and shed light on the world and decisions which our youth is facing, the dangers and trials awaiting them, and was more or less panned by our hypocritical media as a romantic and preachy endeavor.  It saddens me that a piece that would once have been regarded as noble is now thought of as foolish, so far have we fallen.

That of course, is my ideological ramblings. If you're a fan of any of the actors involved, this film truly is a must see, everyone involved is at the top of their game, particularly Tom Cruise. He's on fire as a politician with a goal. Also, as I've said, even looking past the near perfect performances, this film really does have its merits, it's a thoughtful piece.",1206662400,3,1857,4.760869565217392

3260904,5,B000YDJG0I,"This work of Robert Redford is by far, his most ambitious, thoughtful and incisive project, if we take a look about all his previous achievements.

This smart script presents us the different perspectives around a sensible issue about the brutal and devastating conflict that surrounds us a good part of reflections.

Four scenarios, four positions, four defined points of view; the brain, represented by the Senator Irving (Tom Cruise) firmly convinced about this new strategy must prevail and sustained whatever it takes , he represents the rational wing, the wide sector of the pragmatism and decision makings sit on a desk in a comfortable office.

On the other side of the trench, we have to a sensitive, clever and worried journalist (Meryl Streep) who is required by him to make an interview, that works out as an ethical confrontation between the plans and the practical results along all these years; smart strategies of war and hard to die convictions that are loomed in order to preserve the dignity and the proud of the Western hemisphere against the inquisitive responses and arguments exposed by the journalist.

The nerve is symbolized by an idealistic professor (Robert Redford) against his counterpart , his mirror image, the opinion of a brilliant but still immature teenager (Andrew Gardfield) who refuses and criticizes even the meaning of his role in the world. In retrospective style we will witness two students assuming a public posture in a clever exposition of ideas and ideals, though they have chosen to enlist in the Army.

The muscle is represented by the Army, where ironically these young citizens collide, to experience in live flesh the horror of a strategic default, a non foreseen incident or an undesirable collateral damage, when they fall on enemy territory in the heights of a snowy mountain in Afghanistan.

You should see this movie with first rate attention, because its narrative time overcomes by far, its physical time; there's abundant food for thought all the way through, despite of the fact the narrative structure is based on ""Babel"".

3260905,4,B000YDJG0I,"Robert Redford, Tom Cruise, and Meryl Streep have taken every controversial topic of the current war and condensed them into an engrossing, moving, provocative, hour-and-twenty-minute debate movie.

The film takes place over an hour of time, of three separate, yet loosely related, storylines. They are as follows: The first is an ambitious senator (played by Tom Cruise), who has his eye on presidential candidacy, and has called in a famous news reporter (Meryl Streep) to giver her a story for the press about a new strategy he has come up with to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan. He hopes that its success will boost this career and he spends his hour of the movie attempting to explain the facts in a very safe, favorable context to the reporter.

The second story is two marines who are part of the ""new"" strategy being put into operation as the Senator discusses it. The third story is a Californian college professor (played by Robert Redford) who is meeting with one of his students who has missed one-too-many classes. He is the same professor who taught the two marines.

All three storylines are blended together with a seamless, effective simplicity. By having all three happening in the same hour made it effective and almost unsettling as you see the marines fighting in the snowing night, and then come back to the bright, spotless, office of the senator sitting discussing the very strategy being fought. It made me realize how much is constantly happening in simultaneous motion. I cannot even imagine how much has happened as I write this review.

As I said, a myriad of controversial topics are brought up but no real answer offered, but that is how it is effective. It brings up the topics and leaves you thinking about it long afterward without the feeling like you were force-fed one opinion. Two strong points that make the film so good are sharp, to-the-point script and the trio of big-name stars who all do wonderful jobs, especially Meryl Streep.

3260908,5,B000YDJG0I,"A lot has been said about actor/director Robert Redford's film LIONS FOR LAMBS, that it is nothing more than a 100 minute-long political science class wrapped up on celluloid.  Indeed, this is a film that relies on acting, dialogue, and story more than a lot of films that have come out in the last few years, not counting documentaries.  But maybe something like this is needed in Hollywood now: a film driven by acting, dialogue, and story more than mere action sequences, bloodshed, and smart-ass quips.  And since we are dealing with the central issue confronting America today--the War On Terror (or what it has either evolved or devolved into), that makes LIONS FOR LAMBS an impressive piece of American theater.

The film traces three different paths.  One involves a very cynical national TV news reporter (Meryl Streep) being given the job of selling a new plan to somehow finally help ""win"" the War On Terror by a very persuasive up-and-coming neoconservative Senator (Tom Cruise).  The second one involves a university professor (Redford) trying to encourage a bright but slacking student of his (Andrew Garfield) to get involved in the political process before his apathy eats him alive by relating how two previous students in his debate class put their money where their mouths were.  The third path involves those two students (Michael Pena; Derek Luke) who, as Army rangers, find themselves in Afghanistan pinned down by machine gun fire emanating from Taliban fighters on a snow-covered mountain after their chopper goes down in a storm.

As laid out by Redford and screenwriter/co-producer Matthew Michael Carnahan, LIONS FOR LAMBS makes it a point, through sharp dialogue, to remind us once again, as John Lennon once said, that ""apathy isn't it; we can do something.""  For both Pena and Luke, it means putting their lives on the line for the larger causes of freedom and democracy, even when it has long since become clear that the motivating factor is really kind of pointless.  For Streep, it means getting straight answers, even if her subject is someone who won't give anything but roundabout ones.  For Redford's university professor, it means motivating students into doing positive things to change the world and challenge authority.  And for Cruise, it means staying true to his ideology, however far removed from reality that ideology may be.

It's not too terribly surprising that Redford, because of his liberal political beliefs, would be accused of taking a liberal position in this film; it wouldn't be the first time (as ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN or THE CANDIDATE would seem to indicate).  Nor is it too hard to believe that those who would accuse him of such a bias either have not seen LIONS FOR LAMBS or have no intention of doing so but just want to attack the film for the sake of attacking it.  I felt that he did a very even-handed job of showing us both the liberal and the conservative side of the issues surrounding our War On Terror--that it isn't a simple matter of black and white, right and wrong; that taking a stand is not a mere slogan; and that having any kind of extremist ideology can blind us to the mistakes we have made in fighting this war, and the mistakes yet to be made.

Cruise does an extremely cutting job of portraying a neoconservative senator in the film; indeed, I would compare this performance to other fine actors of liberal political slants who do good jobs playing characters who are their polar opposites--Burt Lancaster in SEVEN DAYS IN MAY, and Sterling Hayden in DOCTOR STRANGELOVE.  Streep is at her usual best as the cynical TV reporter who sees our conduct in the War On Terror as a hopeless situation; and Redford never ceases to be persuasive in his own way.

LIONS FOR LAMBS definitely isn't a film for those more interested in bloodshed and testosterone.  But for those looking for what used to make Hollywood films great, namely acting, dialogue, and story, this gets a film and unequivocal recommendation from me.",1198800000,8,3998,4.861561119293078
3260909,2,B000YDJG0I,"As I watched ""Lions for Lambs"", the new film directed by Robert Redford, starring Redford as a college professor, Meryl Streep as a journalist in Washington and Tom Cruise as a Senator, I felt as though I was sitting in a college lecture class, listening to many of the same topics we discussed when I was in school. And that was almost twenty years ago.

The strange thing is, as much as I agree with the politics of this film, I was bored out of my skull.

A little more than two thirds of the film involves actors talking with one another, discussing politics, ideology, and the like. But this is a film. It isn't a play. A film should not be lecturing us, it should tell a story about characters that move us to the point of action. There is an attempt to do this, but it doesn't involve any of the three stars, so it seems to be been given short shrift, it almost seems like an after thought added to give the film a little action.

Janine Roth (Streep), a journalist well respected in Washington circles, rushes to the office of Senator Jasper Irving (Cruise). Irving has asked Roth to meet so he can tell her about a new offensive they are spearheading in Afghanistan. She is surprised to find he has set aside a full hour for their meeting and proceeds to get the facts about this new operation. During the course of their conversation, she peppers him with questions about the status of the war, the decisions made, what we did wrong, etc. At approximately the same time in California, Professor Malley (Redford) meets with one of his promising students, Todd Hayes (Andrew Garfield). Todd hasn't been attending class and Malley wants to know why;. They begin to talk about taking a stand, making a difference, etc. When Malley realizes he isn't getting through, he tells him about the last two students who `gave me any hope'. Through flashbacks, we see how Ernest Rodrigues (Michael Pena, ""Crash"") and Arian Finch (Derek Luke, ""Catch A Fire"", ""Antwone Fisher"") once excited the professor by challenging him then made the decision to enlist in the Army soon after 9/11. The story then flashes to present day again and we see these same two soldiers leading the new offensive into Afghanistan.

I think it is necessary for us to discuss the same things these characters discuss, but because we are basically watching them talk for approximately 75 of the 90 minute running time of the film, there is little or no time for character development, for characters to bring us into the story, to make us care.

Streep comes closest with her portrayal of Janine Roth. As she and Senator Irving (Cruise channeling the character he played in ""A Few Good Men"") sit and talk, Roth is barely able to hide her disbelief for the Senator's new plan and his reasons behind it. She doesn't believe him and tries to get to the bottom of the matter. Irving, initially gung ho to talk with her, he set up the meeting after all, becomes more and more reluctant when he realizes she isn't falling into lock step behind him. She returns to her office and talks to her boss, trying to get him to not air the story, to not validate it and give the public a chance to accept it.

The Redford lecture is more difficult to handle because it involves flashbacks, which lead to more lectures and discussions. This story only makes its point at the very end, when Todd returns to his dorm and finally realizes how ineffectual his age group is, only because they aren't bothering to take a stand or to make their voice heard.

The actual scenes involving the offensive in Afghanistan are interesting, but brief. And even these devolve into the two main characters talking as they await rescue.

It is interesting that we have had many films in last three months telling stories about different aspects of our current involvement in the war in Afghanistan and Iraq. Last month's ""Rendition"", also featuring Meryl Streep, was more effective. It told a fictionalized story, depicting the problem with a policy we have called `rendition'. Because the film had characters, it was easier to become involved in the story. The problem with ""Rendition"" is there are too many characters and we never have a lead character we can empathize with, someone who can lead us to action. ""Lambs"" also fails to incite action because we are basically watching people discuss things we can hear in the news, or read in the paper, or see Jon Stewart make fun of in his Comedy Central program.

I have no problem with the viewpoint presented in the film, and welcome having discussions with others, but why should we pay to listen to others talk? Why not release the film and let people in for free? That might kick start some discussions.

But, of course, that's a pipedream. If the studio released the film, how would they make any money on the film? I mean, they never make any money on their films anyway, right? The biggest blockbuster can still be considered unprofitable. Let's have a discussion about this...",1196035200,4,4971,4.638636363636364
3260910,4,B000YDJG0I,"If you are among the restive viewers who have been ignoring War on Terror films in droves, or if the patter of perspectives usually found in stage plays is not your bag, then let me say first up that Lions for Lambs is not for you. A conventional ""plot"" is conspicuous by its absence, about 80% of the film is polarized chitchat, and it throws more questions into the fray than pat answers. Caveat emptor.

If, on the other hand, the idea of witty back-and-forth on issues very germane in this day and age does not make you want to run back to Seinfeld reruns, here's a taut script packed to the gunnel with some gloriously insouciant dialogue.

We follow three separate strands of it. Tom Cruise plays a presidential hopeful (but, in customary irony, he emphatically denies ever wanting to be one) who has engineered a secret new war strategy to tame the new kind of enemy that lurks overseas. The dubiously labeled ""forward operating points"", we learn. He announces this ever so speciously to a veteran reporter, played by Meryl Streep. Two soldiers, played superbly by Michael Pea and Derek Luke, implement those new orders and land in serious peril. That's the second thread with actual combat action. In parallel, Redford completes the trifecta as a political science professor in ""a California university"", down but not out by the apathy of students, trying to galvanize one of them who is drifting from studies.

All talk and no play could make Jack a dull boy. But Redford's assured direction has the clip and the pizazz to make the static seem kinetic. Streep and Cruise electrify simple banter about popularity polls and botched invasions that feel like they took place last month. There's a liberal dollop (pun intended) of wit and erudition to her talk. As though spurred by her refined touch, Tom Cruise is on a ""Magnolia""-caliber roll, bringing a creepy charisma to a senator clearly in love with the heft of his role.

Surprising, too, is how equal the newcomer Andrew Garfield is to the task of countering Redford as the wayward student whose surfer dude mannerisms conceal a keen mind. On occasion, this professor-pupil talk makes for the worst kind of dialectic--a dry and cliched public service announcement more than clever drama. But thankfully just when we are about to check our watches, we are rescued by provocative interludes of US soldiers stranded in the inclement peaks of Afghanistan. Al Qaeda's militants are depicted as shadowy creatures, literally, which is a touch disingenuous but it's not hard to overlook. The two former students who joined the US army bring enough chemistry to their roles to add an emotional edge.

But to me, therein lies the biggest ham in the script: the portrayal of these hard-working scholarship boys who trundle off into war zones because they want to do ""good"". There's been a tendency in recent years to aggrandize the common soldier which, while properly laying the blame on the political management, risks offering an unrealistic look at the experience of war. Remember&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jarhead/dp/B000DZIGDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jarhead</a>? Ultimately, these are scared kids lost in a foreign country, a reminder of the human life put at risk by high ideals and political sloganeering. Ahem, Mr. Redford.

As a critique of modern politics, however, it plays an even hand. Cruise's senator's assertions hark back to the now-(in)famous Tony Blair speech that gave a short shrift to evidence, vaguely acknowledges past mistakes while repeating them, and displays bafflement for the adversaries who refuse to play by his rules. But Streep's reporter isn't fully devoid of blame either, compromised by the media's early cheer-leading for the Iraq War and her inability to effectively question the party line.

It's rare to see a high-profile movie out of mainstream Hollywood that goes so far out of its way to include everyone, not just the like-minded. It may smack of armchair moralizing, but boring it is not. And unlike some other recent films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rendition/dp/B000WSJNWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rendition</a>, which I nonetheless enjoyed, it isn't preachy either. Instead, to coin a phrase, it's urgeful: whatever you believe, please do something about it.

3260911,4,B000YDJG0I,"Last year I tried to make the case that the best films of the year were the ones that scared the love of Jesus in us. They were movies which told us the world is in trouble, evil lurks everywhere, we aren't safe. It didn't matter what the films was, ""The Departed"", ""The Curse of the Golden Flower"", ""Babel"", ""United 93"" or ""Pan's Labyrinth"". This year it is a little different. The films this year seem to take us back to the 1960s. There has been a steady trend since 2004 of very political films. First they started out as documentaries; ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", ""The War Tapes"", ""No End in Sight"", ""Uncovered"", ""Hunting of a President"", ""Bush's Brain""...ect Then featured films started to tackle the issues, ""Good Night & Good Luck"", ""Syriana"" and now Robert Redford's ""Lions for Lambs"".

 ""Lions for Lambs"" surprisingly has not been getting a lot of traction. It hasn't pulled in impressive box-office, critics did not welcome it and neither did the public. It's hard to say why, but I'm glad I saw the film anyway. It's one of the better films released this year.

 Naturally, with any political film, there will be those of an opposing view who will damn the movie because it does not represent their political side. But, I think this was Redford's point. If you don't like the film, ask yourself why? Because of its politics? What about its politics don't you like? See what's happening here, a discussion, a debate. Just what we need.

 ""Lions of Lambs"",if I listened correctly, is a film which argues President Bush is incompetent, mistakes were made during the Iraq war, the media didn't question this war and Iraq is now a quagmire. We are no longer fighting in Iraq for our original intention, and the situation has escalated beyond our control and the war is not winnable.

 Many have argued the film is not saying anything new. Maybe. But what I admire about the film is the way it says what it says. People aren't going to see this movie,a shame, but, this is the kind of film that twenty years from now if my children were to watch it and ask me, is this what people thought of Bush and the Iraq war? I could look them straight in the eyes and say yes, this is exactly what people thought. ""Lions for Lambs"" then becomes a time capsule. It is a film which I think could add to our national dialogue. It takes ideas and stances on issues which many people feel and reflects them in an articulate manner.

 The film revolves around three storylines all happening at once. Redford plays a professor trying to talk a student (Andrew Garfield) into sticking to his class and recognizing his potential. Tom Cruise plays Sen. Jasper Irving a chest pounding, war hungry Republican giving an interview to reporter Janine Roth (Merly Streep) on a new military strategy, which is basically, prolong the war. And finally a military mission going on in Afghanistan, which involves two of Redford's former students, both who enlisted in the war against their professor's advice, who had been drafted in Vietnam.

 These three stories come together by the time the film ends and Redford's intentions are quite clear with the film. It is anti-Bush and anti-war. But so what? At least the film is about something. Why does the public think that is such a bad idea. Going back to the 1960s at least filmmakers then had the guts to make films about something. They were usually made by directors with last names like Godard, Bergman and Tarkovsky. I'm not saying Redford is as good as these directors but he has made a film which reminds me of the spirit of those films. Like a Godard films such as ""Tout va bien"" or ""Weekend"", ""Lions for Lambs"" is a movie which in time I think will be seen as a time capsule, a reflection  of the public's conscience.

 As you might be able to tell from my description the film is not really about anything else besides its ideas. The cinematography is not memorable,nor is the music or the editing. It is shot conventionally. The performances are good and get their point across, but I doubt Cruise or Streep will get nominated for their work here. Though both do a fine job. But despite everything,I still think people should see this film.

 Bottom-line: A perfect time capsule of the times we will. A film which deals with contemporary ideas and issues. I think one of the year's best films.",1195862400,5,4322,4.614080834419817
3260912,5,B000YDJG0I,"I mean that sincerely. It's obvious to me the two male soldiers in this movie are in love with each other! Whether they were lovers is another matter, left to one's imagination. Why do I come to this conclusion? It's based on a pattern of events. First body language. These two men are extremely comfortable being in close proximity to each other. In the college debate scene both young men were in perfect sync when speaking.  They  make a major life change together when they decide to join the army. On the helicopter they are joyously playing agility games with their hands. When one falls out of the helicopter at a great height, the other consciously decides to jump out after him. Most importantly, their final dramatic scene  is downright romantic! How many of us would give up our lives in such a way unless we were in love? To put it mildly, this is a brave and gutsy film!

This provocative story is also a call to action! I'm personally afraid of our current Executive Branch of the Federal government. Something that dampens my enthusiasm for political action.  I believe we Americans are being ruled by a bunch of lunatics with agendas we will never totally understand. While the dialog between the smart aleck college student and the wizened professor is more about this student's contempt and cynicism, reading between the lines, it's also about fear. Fear of failure, fear of the unknown, fear of getting hurt, even fear of wasting one's time.  But isn't it about time we stop being afraid, cynical or contemptuous and start doing something constructive to end the the Iraqi war? And, then  make sure this kind of  war never happens again during our lifetimes? I really hope  so!",1195257600,3,1696,4.722033898305085
