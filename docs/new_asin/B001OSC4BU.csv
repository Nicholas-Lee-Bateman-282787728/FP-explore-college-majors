8331346,5,B001OSC4BU,"This is a superb release of two very hard to find Bollywood Horror flicks by the immensely talented Ramsay brothers. For those of you who bought the first collection, this is an essential buy. Superbly transferred from the original negatives with the release trailers included, this is the best these films have looked since their release. Veerana in particular, is one of the greatest forays into gothic horror by these brothers. The lead star, Jasmin is simply unforgettable as the evil vampire Nikita. Thanks a million Mondo Macabro for salvaging these true cult classics of Bollywood and restoring them to their near-original glory. Cannot wait for more volumes in this series.",1238457600,22,681,5.1441441441441444
