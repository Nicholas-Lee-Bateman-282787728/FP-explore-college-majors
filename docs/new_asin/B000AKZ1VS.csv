8078673,4,B000AKZ1VS,If your are starting from scratch and want to learn how to fish or take your kids fishing then get this series of videos.  Beware of the DVD's from Bennett.  They all had a production flaw and I sent them back.  I bought the VHS series and have not had a problem.,1257206400,,263,4.019230769230769
