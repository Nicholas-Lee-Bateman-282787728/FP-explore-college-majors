8237949,3,B0010KG288,"The teacher Michael Casswell can play, and likes to put on a show a bit, however, he's got it down, and you'll get the note for note instruction on how to play this take on ""Brush With The Blues"", however, he neglects to discuss getting the tone that needed to have this kind of sound. Try playing this flat, with no effects, and it'll sound like garbage. he should really discuss in detail how Jeff gets the guitar to sound the way it does, that is almost as important as the licks in and of itself. That's the flaw with this instruction, sure if you have your Klon, delay, reverb, Marshall DSL1000, and all the other ingrediants that go into getting this sound, that might help. Aside from that, he's on target with the note for note instruction.",1400025600,,748,4.427536231884058
8237950,5,B0010KG288,"There are certain guitar players I'd never really think of imitating and one of them is Jeff Beck.  I don't have 100 lifetimes to even approximate it.  But in my search to be a better player I thought I'd give this DVD a try.  For the price if I got even three good tips / licks or ideas I'd be set.  This DVD does deliver to my amazement!

I've studied a bit of fingerstyle from travis picking to blues, lead playing, fretboard and music theory.  It helps to have an understanding of all those to get the most out of what you're trying to learn on this DVD.  If you don't then you'll miss a lot and how to apply it to your own playing but there is still a ton to enjoy and try out on  your own.  It starts off very slow but that can be a great comfort for some.  Fingering styles.  Wammy bar setup.  I wish he would play the licks ""clean"" then processed.  It would make learning faster - at least for me.  Really do be prepared with the remote to pause /rewind and sheet of tab paper to make notes.  Why licklibraries don't have even rudimentary tabs in pdf as a jump start for your own notes has always been disappointing.

I think that some of the licks were rather weak and not as good as real Beck.  But the huge plus is that in showing you how to get the sound your ears change.  You'll be in a better position to understand the original recordings.  I found that a fascinating transformation.  So I had to give it 5 stars for that alone.

An additional advantage of this DVD is by showing you non typical ways of approaching guitar you find that many parts of these ideas are applicable to other guitarists like Adrian Belew.  And with a little bit of study of the DVD you will be doing it to.",1322697600,,1700,4.134556574923548
8237951,5,B0010KG288,"FIRST OFF YOU HAVE TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT PLAYING
GUITAR AND SOMETHING ABOUT JEFF BECAUSE THIS DVD
IS NOT AIMED FOR A BEGINNING GUITAR PLAYER.
  JEFF IS FAMOUS FOR HIS THUMB , FOREFINGER AND WHAMMY BAR TECHNIQUES.AND LET ME TELL YOU ITS NOT
THAT EASY.SOME TIME AND EFFORT ARE INVOLVED TO REALLY
GET IT DOWN.
  WHEN I GET A DVD INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO I ALWAYS THINK THAT EVEN IF I GET ONE OR TWO NEW TRICKS ITS WORTH IT.
THERES MORE THEN THAT ON THIS DVD.
  THE INSTRUCTOR IS VERY GOOD BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN BEFORE YOU REALLY GET THAT THING THAT JEFF DOES SO WELL.
  ONE THING I WISH ALL INSTRUCTORS WOULD DO IS TO PLAY THE LICK  VERY,VERY SLOW SO YOU CAN GET IT.THE SAME GOES HERE.
  THE INSTRUCTOR REALLY UNLOCKS SOME SECRETS HERE.
IVE ADDED A FEW LICKS TO MY GUITAR PLAYING SO IM SAYING WELL DONE.",1278892800,3,823,4.245161290322581

8237953,5,B0010KG288,"This video instruction is absolutely great, but truly beware and heed the other reviewrs: it is definitely not for a beginner - but if you still want to tackle it, be sure to practice your E and B scales, up and down, frontwise and backward until you cant stand it, and then do it all over again BEFORE getting on with this video.  However, once you're on board, the tips and cues are precise awesome building blocks that set up a good foundation for some Jeff Beck styled improvisation.
And remember, grow your right thumb and index fingernails because you're going to be putting away your favored pic or pic.",1241395200,9,610,4.545454545454546
8237954,5,B0010KG288,"This is a fantastic instructional DVD that really will have you sounding like JEFF BECK! The DVD uses the tune ""brush with the blues"" from Jeff's ""who else"" album as a template for the lessons. BE AWARE...this  is Not for beginners! BUT.. if you are an intermediate to advanced player, and you want to learn a slew of ""beck-isms"" this DVD will work. You will learn many trademark licks and tricks of the master. Mr, Casswell has it NAILED! this is really the ONLY DVD on the market dedicated to Becks style. WORTH EVERY PENNY. BUY IT..NOW! 5 STARS!",1223424000,12,548,4.5353535353535355
