1087527,5,6305906807,"I would like to provide an additional perspective from someone who knows Russian and read Pushkin's novel several times in the original language. I believe if one is to enjoy this novel in English, prose is the only way to achieve it, and this movie certainly does the job. It's not the most faithful adaption, nor could it possibly be. The original is timeless and beautiful... and let's keep it on its pedestal. The movie, however, is something completely different - and it's all the better for it.
This is a wildly romantic fable about disillusionment, cynicism, and their clash with moral strength and commitment. The title character is so sated with life and its excesses that he looks and wants for nothing anymore, believing all that this world can offer him is meaningless. To his great misfortune (or is it fortune?), he is proven wrong.
There are several things that Martha Fiennes, director, does right here: she extracts every ounce of talent from Ralph Fiennes and Liv Tyler (her best work to date - she needs more of such roles), she creates an atmosphere of longing that doesn't release the viewer until the credits roll on the screen, and she sticks true to the characters' dimensions. The movie is never boring or slow. Music is so well matched to action that one marvels at it - Tchaikovsky's opera has a contender in Onegin's score.
Also, the DVD itself is very well-made - quality is excellent, there are plenty of extra features, the interviews with the cast are especially insightful, and the director's commentary is like icing on the cake.
From someone very skeptical about ""period pieces"" and any adaptations of Russian literature by English directors, I must say... we need more of such movies. I will be the first in line for the next work from Martha, whatever it may be about.",975974400,104,1806,4.773162939297125
1087528,5,6305906807,"Comparable to ""An Age of Innocence"" in pace and message, Onegin reminds us of the danger and sometimes irreversible and devastating consequences that procrastination and pride can have when allowed to enter a relationship.
Beautifully cast and developed, this story was riveting to watch as each tragic event slowly unfolded, revealing strengths and flaws in characters each of us can identify with at some level.",975888000,8,413,5.369230769230769
1087529,3,6305906807,"My perception of the film was greatly influenced by the close familiarity with Pushkin's novel-in-verse I've acquired through numerous readings of  the text both in Russian (my native tongue) and in several English  translations.  Thus, (nitpicking?)comparsion of the cinematographic version  to the literary original was pretty inevitable as I watched the film.  I'm  surprised by all the positive reviews I see here for I think that this  movie is simply pathetic and laughable.  Its portrayal of the characters,  the times, the themes is grossly inadequate.  Most importantly, it  completely misses the mood (or, rather, the many moods) of the novel.  Too  many of the interpretations on the part of the director and actors are  preposterous, and - worst of all - one-sided.  The vapid Liv Tyler is  entirely unfit for the role of passionate Tatyana, and, as a result, her  performance is a miserable failure.  For one, Tatyana wouldn't be caught  dead singing cheesy Russian romance songs.  Fiennes as Onegin doesn't  deliver either.  The duel scene, while visually impressive, is painfully  out-of-place and overdramatized.  The very atmosphere of the film is  ridiculously misrepresented...
Although I couldn't keep a sardonic grin  away practically for the entire duration of the movie, I realize that I may  be misjudging the value of the film and the achievements of the filmmakers  because of my preconcevied ideas of what ""Onegin"" should be on  screen or on stage.  Undoubtedly, attempting to render an authentic  portrayal of the work that serves (almost unarguably) as the foundation of  modern Russian literature and trying to depict with accuracy the most  renowned (anti)hero of Russian literature - Onegin - is a great  (unsurmountable?) challenge.  Does that mean that any attempt should be met  with admiration nevertheless? I'm still trying to decide.
The film  suffered from the incredible hype that preceded its premiere because it did  not live up to the expectations of most who impatiently awaited its  release.",966902400,31,2036,5.283018867924528
1087530,4,6305906807,"Fine performances highlight `Onegin,' a generally interesting version of Pushkin's complex love story whose contemporary significance shines through  the tortured souls of its two main characters. Ralph Fiennes stars in the  title role as a 19th Century Russian aristocrat who, like many similar  figures in Russian literature of that time, suffers from the attenuating  effects of enervation and ennui. Though the recipient of vast sums of  wealth and property at the death of his uncle, Onegin finds no meaning or  solace in life as he lives it. He is as bored by the stifling  superficiality of the privileged elite languishing in splendor in the fancy  halls and glittering ballrooms of cosmopolitan St. Petersburg as he is by  the domestic dreariness of the provincials residing in the bucolic  countryside where one of his uncle's vast estates is located. In the latter  setting, while visiting Vladimir - a poet he has recently befriended -  Onegin becomes drawn to Tatyana the beautiful younger sister of the man's  fianc. Both Onegin and Tatyana reflect a remarkably modern sensibility in  their temperaments. For instance, though the attraction between the two is  a mutual one, it is Tatyana who makes the first move, pouring out her  unbridled love for this newcomer in a letter which Onegin politely rejects  because he fears the deadening of the soul that he believes will inevitably  accompany marriage and fidelity. One can't get much more contemporary in  tone than these two characters, one stepping well out of the accustomed  bounds accorded her sex in affairs of romance and the other reflecting the  fear of commitment that is such a staple of modern times. Yet, fate plays  its cruelest hand at the end, as Onegin finds himself, years later, trapped  in an ironic role reversal as the now-married Tatyana is forced to rebuff  the advances of the obsessed, lovelorn man whom she still admits to loving.  As in many bleak works of Russian literature, the character is forced to  live out his existence in a hell of his own making, suffering the torment  of regret without end.
The personal drama unfolds against the fascinating  backdrop of the subtly changing society of 19th Century Russia, a country  that, then and now, has seemed to be always several centuries behind its  European neighbors in its moves towards liberalization in the areas of  basic human and civil rights. We see clearly the struggle between the empty  ritualism and entrenched barbarism of the past, as reflected in the  continuing institution of serfdom and in gun duels fought over affairs of  honor, and the enlightened philosophy of the coming world, as many young  aristocrats begin to champion both the abolition of serfdom and the growing  acceptance of love as the foundation of marriage. Indeed, the two young  lovers cannot extricate themselves from the entanglements that often  accompany a time unsure of its traditions. Onegin, for all his talk about  freeing his serfs, is himself forced to participate in a duel that both  horrifies and disgusts him. And Tatyana, for all her comments about only  marrying a man she loves, succumbs to the pressure of tradition, ultimately  agreeing to a marriage based on class, money and position. Here are two  people caught in a world not yet ready for them, who are forced to settle  for the compromises their society has deemed fit and proper.
This  well-acted, well-written and well-directed film may seem a bit slow at  times, but the intelligence of the dialogue, the subtle underplaying of the  cast and the quiet beauty of much of the direction lead us into a strange  world of the past that still has resonance and relevance for the world of  today.",966556800,15,3705,4.985270049099836
1087531,5,6305906807,"This is a truly wonderful film.  It is an adaptation of the 19th century romantic poem by Alexander Pushkin about the tragic love affair between  Evgeny Onegin (Ralph Fiennes) and Tatyana Larina (Liv Tyler).  Evgeny has  inherited his uncle's provincial estate and goes to the country to put his  affairs in order.  While there, he befriends Vladimir (Toby Stevens) who  introduces him to Tatyana, the sister of his fianc.  Tatyana falls madly  in love with Evgeny, but he brutally rejects her and leaves to return to  St. Petersburg.  Upon returning years later to find her married, his  regrets ignite into a passionate and obsessive love for her.
There has  been some criticism of the fact that this film was produced by Ralph  Fiennes to give a project to his sister Martha (director) and brother  Magnus (original music).  Well, if this is the high quality wrought from  Fiennes nepotism, we need more such collaborations.
In her feature  film directorial debut, Martha Fiennes gives us outstanding imagery,  precise period renderings, innovative camera work, and dramatic lighting.  The sets, locations, costumes and props were fabulous.  I especially loved  the furniture.  The scenes on the dock by the mill in the fog were eerie  and chilling.  One shot of Liv Tyler in a rowboat, shot through  out-of-focus reeds in the foreground, was pure art.  The extreme close-up  of the inking of the love letter added to the power of the emotions being  written.  Remi Adefarasin (`Elizabeth') added wondrous cinematography to  the list of filmmaking kudos.
Ralph Fiennes delivers another superb  performance as Evgeny.  In the early scenes, he is cavalier, self absorbed,  and arrogant to the point of being despicable.  His stoical dismissal of  Tatyana was ice cold.  In the later scenes, he delivers a character so  pathetically tormented by love that he wins back our sympathies.
This is  by far the best performance I have seen by Liv Tyler.  She was poised,  graceful and lovely, and gave an extremely dignified performance.  With  this role, she has proven that she can move beyond the troubled teen type  and play a character with substance.
This is intelligent and inspired  filmmaking.  I rated it a 9/10.  The pacing is deliberate, so action  junkies will want to pass on this film.  However, for those who can savor a  compelling love story with splendid imagery, this film should not be  missed.",965001600,137,2409,5.002544529262087
1087532,4,6305906807,"Onegin is a timeless tale that is celebrated worldwide.  It ""hails"" a young philander, blinded by the disillution of Petersburg, Onegin, who inherits his deceased uncle's provincial estate.  The opulence of the captial has crippled his morality and he finds himself  a drifter in the contagious insular warmth; a courageous, free-thinking,  idealistic young girl catches his eyes. Onegin mercilessly rejects the girl  (Liv Tyler""'s bold declaration only to save himself the trouble of  actually falling in love; instead, he flirts with the girl's engaged  sister. He sees the gleaming spark of love, but the hard shell that has  protected him from humaness leads to the tragic route he eventually  takes--even years after he departs from the shattered frame he leaves  behind.  And when Onegin does see Tantyana (Liv Tyler's character) again,  in the same opulence he fled from, he is torn by the compunction of an  undisplined heart.
Debuting diretor Martha Fiennes does a fabulous job in  staying true to Pushkin's sweeping tone.  The camera work also gives it a  look of grandeur.  But what really made this an unforgetable piece of art  is its subtle treatment of relationships and of passions.  Pushkin is the  Byron of the Russian language, and of course Onegin is Don Juan's assumed  counterpart; but verses contain much and retain much, keen eyes need to dig  into the lines to find the hard wisdom lurking behind Pushkin's  melliflorous lyrics.  This is where Martha Fiennes excelled; she has a  great eye for hidden truth, and with the surperb casting of Liv Tyler, the  helpless yearning is carefully shrouded within innocence.  As a huge  Russian literature fan, I was slightly offended by the use of British  accent in this film; but truly, I don't see another actor more suitable  than Ralph Fiennes to creep under the flamboyant skin of the title  character.  His icy eyes make him a perfect heartless man, and Tyler's  drooping warmth makes her a perfect temptation and hindrance to the  philander who is daunted by the prospect of true love.  The scenes shot in  St. Petersburg are just breataking; the wintry ambiance makes everything in  Pushkin's timeless tale come alive.  It gave my imagination an outlet, and  the costume job almost led me to overlook the British actors. True, this is  a film of little action, but the one sequence of duel between Onegin and  his best friend, is beautifully filmed and the bullet grazes more than  skin--it grazes Onegin's superficiality.  The pace is slow at times, but  over all, the tale is in one motion, galloping like a troika across the  virgin lands towards the deepest realization of the soul.",964310400,18,2660,4.972602739726027
1087533,5,6305906807,"This film of Pushkin's famous tragedy is the lasting memorial to the Pushkin Bicentennial celebrations of the last year.
The film left me emotionally crushed.  My (Russian) wife could hardly speak afterwards.  The  audience were in tears throughout the film.  Though, neither through  'syrupy' nor cynical plot twists, but through the freshness of the acting  and the awful tragedy of Onegin's life.
Onegin initially appears as a  wealthy sybarite dandy in Petersburg's 'belle societie'.  His morals and  emotions have declined to a point where his life has neither meaning nor  direction. Living , for him, becomes nauseatingly predictable and painful.  Startled by the innocence of a young and intelligent provincial lady  (Tatjana) that he meets on his (rarely-visited) country estate, he  experiences a profound change in his attitude towards his life.  Tatjana  distantly views Onegin as a graceful man-of-letters who could lead her into  a new glittering life away from the provinces.  Now, enter Tatjana's local  admirer, a jealous and compulsive man, and a breathtakingly beautiful  flirty young woman who also wishes to escape the provinces. Tragedy ensues,  spread over time and distance. Now watch the film..
Ralph Fiennes' style  of acting puts me in mind of Anthony Hopkins' Shadowlands: that is,  expressing withheld emotions through his eyes.  Liv Tyler shouldn't be  maligned, she is a fine Tatjana and handles the role well.  It's true that  some of the props and scenes are not representative of Pushkin's time. But  they in no way distract from the film.
My Russian collegues loved the  film especially Ralph Fiennes who has become quite the celebrity in Russia  through the film.  Though he is also known for his Almeida Chekhov  interpretations.  My thanks to the crew and actors for this wonderful film.",963532800,16,1825,5.229166666666667
1087534,3,6305906807,"'Onegin' is just one the continuing prolific offerings from the Fiennes family. This time it is sister Martha who basks in the glory with her feature debut.
Ralph's performance as Onegin is also superb and is  entirely suited to it given his recent  detached torn-lover roles (Count  Laszlo Almasy,  Maurice Bendrix etc). Onegin is a bored socialite who has  much disdain for the social ongoings of Petersburg. It is not until he goes  to the countryside to visit his dying uncle that he becomes interested in a  local young girl. Liv Tyler, the object of beauty, also delivers a more  than fine performance. Her character resists much of a typical middle-class  woman's etiquette -and wished to marry for love's sake rather than for  connections.
I don't want to give too much of the plot away since it is  paper thin to begin with. I've never really understood the lack of  forgiveness for thin plots as a deliberate device and having said that  there are other cinematic elements used to sustain the viewers attention.  The cinematography is breathtaking as the film's lyrical mood is visually  conveyed through well articulated framing. Add to the sombre tones, the  fluidity of slow movement and gesture and the end result is an intensity  that continues to grow.
This film is not destined to be considered a  classic nor as a sweeping epic - however it certainly is fine viewing on a  quiet Sunday evening.",963273600,4,1412,4.832635983263598
1087535,3,6305906807,"Having read Pushkin's novel, this movie does an admirable job in keeping with the tone of the book.  However, the plain unrefined country girl in the novel is portrayed by the beautiful & graceful Liv Tyler.  Onegin's  treatment of Tatyana  is conceivable in the book but rather hard to believe  in the movie when it involves Ms. Tyler.",962841600,4,336,4.724137931034483
1087536,4,6305906807,"To be accurate and honest, first of all I'd advise you to read the original poem by Pushkin, then you'll learn that the characters spoke only in verse and did not sing that funny Russian folk song as Olga (the oldest  of Larins sisters), that Onegin did not live in a house reminding seat of  the Roman Senate and that Lenskij was not portrayed as such a whining and  stubborn weakling, as well as many other details of life and traits of  petty landowners of the beginning of the 19th century that Pushkin  ridiculed.
Apart from those minor inaccuracies (which actually made this  poem, especially its first part,social satyre), I was overwhelmed by Ms  Fiennes' stunning ability to recreate the atmosphere and spirit of the  times and land she's never seen before: the beauty of the Russian  countryside with its peaceful and lazy sunlit summer evenings, dense  forests, misty mornings and chilly transparent autumn evenings; the  grandeur and boredom of St Petersbourg's ball rooms and winter snow-covered  plazas.
Mr Fiennes as Onegin is the best choice for this role: bored  and spoiled by life aristocrat whose personal tragedy turns to be an  everlasting drama of love that he was not able to understand and reply and  that reaches him as nemesis in 2 years. Ms. Tyler is fresh and beautiful as  Tatyana Larina awakening to call of first love only to be rebuked and midly  rejected by Onegin, the decision that he will be regretting all his  remaining life...
True, the last and most touching scene of the movie is  the fruit of Ms. Fiennes' imagination, but it only adds to the drama and  desperation of Onegin and Tatyana's final meeting.
It is a beautiful and  heart-wrenching story of love so easily lost and lives so carelessly  ruined.",962582400,7,1748,4.795302013422819

The acting is good, but I found it hard to really like the main character. He's weird. Is it interesting? Yes. Will it make you think or feel? Probably. Will you like it? That part is debatable.

1088076,2,6305906807,"I was born in Russia and my native language is Russian. I have read the Pushkin's novel in verse many times. I love it.

I think that this film is as close to ""Eugene Onegin"" as Woody Allen's ""Love and Death"" is close to Tolstoy's ""War and Peace"".
In fact, if Woody Allen, instead of Ralph Fiennes, played Onegin, the film would have made a great parody and many strange moments in the film would have been perfectly suitable.
Such as:
- Onegin's weird friends, who look as if they have been just released from an asylum.
- An absence of cultivated soil around the Onegin's and Larins' houses. There are no gardens. It looks like each house was deliberately built in the middle of a forest, and for some reason later a sawmill was built next to it - because random piles of logs can be seen quite frequently, even from the windows.
- Onegin's house itself, which resembles the Parthenon, not the house of a Russian noble.
- People who are ice skating on Neva are constantly falling. Why?
- Russia looks like a gloomy, dark, strange, surreal place. Cracks in the walls. Peeling paint. Poor people in rags. That is not how Pushkin portrays Russia in the poem. He loved Russia.
Of course, there is a lot of snow. So much snow that when Onegin arrives to his late uncle's house he has to walk to it through snowdrifts; they could not bring him to the entrance.

Music in the film is not from that period. Glinka's ""Waltz-Fantasia"" was written after Pushkin died. Waltz ""On the Hills of Manchuria"" was written in 1906. It simply does not sound like music of the beginning of the 19th century.
Lensky and Olga sing a song from the 20th century. But actually, it is not important when the song was written. Russian nobles at that time would not have sung such a simple song; they would have thought it not sophisticated enough, even primitive. The Russian nobility was not close to the common people. As Pushkin wrote, ""Tatyana did not read our magazines and spoke her native language with difficulties.""

Tatyana's phrase in the end: ""Am I now noble enough for you?"" (which does not exist in the poem) does not convey her feelings,  it  oversimplifies them.

This film is not what it aspires to be. And the main reason seems to be that its creators apparently admire Pushkin, but the world they seek to describe is completely alien to them. Please, read Pushkin's novel before you watch this film.
On the second thought - no, better do not read it... because your heart, like mine, will be broken when you will see the novel hacked this way.",1400112000,4,2535,4.524017467248909

Upon his return he fines Tatianna married to a very well to do Prince. Her roll has changed she is now a woman of statue. She is a Princess very well read and very beautiful. He see all of it now and tries to win her love for him back. This is where I give credit to the direction in this movie. Her charater does not allow herself to fall for him again. Mind you she is still in love with him. However, she will not be unfaithful to her husband which I think is a plus. She watch in the begining how things went with her sister's finance and how the out come was. She in my opinion acted very well in this position. She didn't let her feelings for Onegin alter her respect for her husband and friend. Even though she still loved Onegin she knew it would have been a graved mistake in that period to changed and run off with him. He had predicted in the begining how if married to him would be scandal and the like. She was thinking when she says to him it hurts because you are too late.  Very good film.

1088264,2,6305906807,"Well, Russian stories usually bore me. I should have known better. Eugene Onegin (Ralph Fiennes) was originally a poem by Pushkin. I've never read any of Puskin's poetry, and this gives me the warning not to bother. But then, very little poetry interests me.

Onegin inherits a huge estate in the country. He's been living in Petersburg, but when he goes to the country estate, he decides to stay awhile. He had been horribly bored with society in Petersburg, and there are some beautiful neighbors. One is engaged to be married to a friend he made the day he arrived in the country, and the other is her sister. But the sisters went to a soothsayer who predicted that both of them would marry soldiers. Well, neither Onegin nor his neighbor who is engaged are soldiers.

The younger sister, the one who is not engaged, is Tatyana (Liv Tyler). She naturally falls in love with Onegin. One tear-filled night, she stays up all night writing him a letter pouring out what is in her heart. But he declares that he has no heart, and cannot love.

Then Onegin insults her older sister, and her fiance must of course challenge him to a duel. Though it is clearly not what he intended, Onegin kills him. Filled with remorse, he leaves his country estate.

The next scenes are years later, and it would simply ruin what's left of the story to tell you what happens if you haven't already guessed. The settings and costumes are lavish, but the story is one that's been told way too many times, is overly romantic in a very Russian dark way, and frankly, I grew bored.",1336867200,,1557,4.55

Originally I got to see this film on the big screen on an invitation from friends studying Russian language and literature. That means without a doubt the great and incomparable writer giant Pushkin.
Straight off I found the setting of a rural backwater setting and photographic panorama of leafy forestry lakes and waters a wonderland. In fact an autumn delight to set a stage for what are good and convincing actors. The heart stings are the somewhat sad and confused signals in the main protagonists love games ending in the unrequited finality of the final scenes. Yeah romantic rubbish I hear people shout, but at the same time the Pushkin story and poise delivered by these this cast of actors brings it all to totally and utterly truth. Hey it happens that way even in fast modern times, except without the duels etc..
Another heart string in the ""inner space"" this film version seemingly has. Type of thoughtful resistive moments you get in those there samurai movies with Akira Kurosawa. Those thoughtful pauses that make you wonder what's going to happen next, what is the characters' decision or action going to create.

Truth to tell, there wasn't enough interaction between the two for me to believe Tatyana was more then crushing on Onegen, and the Onegen was not just attracted to a younger woman.

1088448,4,6305906807,"Onegin is a relatively short movie that's a joy to watch. It's a love story, or more correctly, a lost love story. She loves him first. He subsequently returns that love, but he's too late. Timing is everything. She loves him when it matters, but he squelches that love. He's a cold fish, melancholy, with his own warped ideas about real commitment. So we have a beautiful country girl from a wealthy family with a taste for books and a love of the outdoors. Hmmm... this doesn't seem too hard to figure out. Hey, Onegin, perhaps you should give this romance a little more consideration. But he seems immediately repulsed by the idea, tosses her letter into the fire. He's a tragic figure, basically a knob, remote, somewhat depressive. Thinks he's got it all figured out, too clever by half. Probably needs some good strong coffee and a lithium tablet or possibly a whack upside his head. He lets an angel slip through his fingers, breaks her heart, mortally wounds her. That's not something heaven is likely to forgive or forget.

The movie does what it intends to do very well. It's got a rich gothic mood, often rustic, sometimes opulent, sometimes slightly creepy, but always interesting. The old Russian mansions and the wardrobes are spot on, simply magnificent. His dead uncle looks like Dracula asleep in his coffin. There's even a fortune teller who reads wax drippings from a candle. But the duel is surely the turning point of the movie. One man will die for love in an act of madness, and one man will simply walk away from love. Quite a contrast, but both are ultimately tragic figures. Neither man has a wholesome perspective on human relationships. And neither gets to spend a lifetime with the woman he loves. Paradise lost. The climactic scene in the palace music room is absolutely classic in all respects. Liv Tyler's finest five minutes on film.

1088449,4,6305906807,"I'm not certain why I had a negative preconception of ""Onegin"" (1999), the Fiennes family's film adaptation of Alexander Pushkin's novel ""Eugene Onegin"". Perhaps it was because its Marketing handled the movie's original release so poorly (I understand the PR people were pronouncing the title as though it were a single shot of Tangueray) and withdrew it from distribution so abruptly. As it turns out, this is an cooly elegant version of the cynical love story, though it does require a rarefied taste to appreciate it. A passing acquaintance with Romantic classics like ""La Nouvelle Hlose"" and ""Die Schne Mllerin"" helps. I call it a family film because it was directed by Martha Fiennes, stars Ralph Fiennes in the title role, and their brother Magnus Fiennes composed the restrained score. (Wisely, Tschaikovsky's operatic music has been avoided, even the famous Polonaise. There is, however, some ""Fidelio"" on the soundtrack near the end.) Beautifully photographed by Remi Adefarasin, the picture captures the atmosphere of early 19th Century Russia (love those borzois!), many frames resembling canvases painted under the Tsars. The acting is quietly effective. Ralph Fiennes is the ideal Onegin, a brooding, contemptous Childe Harold. Toby Stephens as Lensky has the somewhat navely peevish attitude that makes his fate believable. Pushkin's gentle heroine is played by Liv Tyler, who at the time was being promoted as the new Ava Gardner. (This was one of Hollywood's sad attempts to recapture the glamor of its studio-system past.)  Liv Tyler is lovely, but she does not possess Gardner's Southern sultriness, which would have been all wrong for Tatyana. As it is, her shy sensitivity fits the part like a glove. The story line is not slavishly faithful to Pushkin, but altogether it maintains the novel's mood suitably, and evidently some people have complained that the film is not at all warm. But let's be honest: this isn't Paris, it's St Petersburg, and, like that city, ""Onegin"" can, appropriately, be a bit cold and distant.",1266969600,,2040,5.181818181818182

Moreover, even if you've never read the novel, still it's a beautiful film about love, longing, passion, and staying faithful to your values and morals. I think Liv Tyler did a great job portraying Tatyana. In fact, I could not imagine anyone else doing it better, and thank god, Gwyneth Paltrow wasn't chosen for it (I think she's overrated).

A fascination with France notwithstanding Napoleon. I think the movie,thematically and visually, captures what I perceive to be the essence of Russia. I thought the musical score was uninspiring.

1088452,3,6305906807,"Onegin (1999)

Directed:  Martha Fiennes

Cast:  Ralph Fiennes: Eugene Onegin, Liv Tyler: Tatiana Larina,  Toby Stevens: Vladimir Lensky, Lena Headway:Olga Larina, Martin Donavan: Prince Nikitin

This movie merits some attention, for its style, if not for its content, which is not inconsiderable. Directed by Martha Fiennes, it is really the creation of her brother, Ralph, who had read Alexander Pushkin's poetic drama, Eugene Onegin, when he was a young student, and thought it would make a good movie. It took years for that to be accomplished, and the result is a literary masterpiece translated into the screen with a little more than mediocre results as a movie, but with unmistakable signs of the original genius behind it. The movie has, of course, its plusses, but also is marked and marred by its slow pace, a rather inanimate performance but the exquisitely beautiful Liv Tyler, and a somewhat weak ending. It is lushly photographed, well scored, with gypsy music and an aria from Beethoven's Fidelio, and it does convey the atmosphere and ethos of post-Napoleonic Russia, when land owners still owned serfs and the aristocracy was the dominant class. Onegin was, in the words of Fiennes, an anti-hero, a fatigued, blaze` denizen of the big city (St. Petersburg), who had come to the country to inherit the vast estate of his dead uncle, and who had rather lofty ideas--not ideals--about the inferiority of the local gentry. But he possessed a worn wisdom and sterling honesty that did not allow him to get involved with a young woman whose passion for him he considered impulsive, and was reluctant to enter an ephemeral relationship that would only cause trouble and scandal. But he is attracted to Tatiana Larina more than he would like to admit, and when he imprudently asks Olga Larina, her rather light-headed sister, for an extra dance, he offends the man intended for her, and his best friend, Vladimir Lansky, is not satisfied with anything less than a duel.  Onegin, progressive for his age, and knowing he is a superior shot, tries to dissuade Lansky, who is adamant, but fails to fire straight, and in response Onegin kills him. He does indeed consider himself a victim of circumstances, but he could not be a winner in a society still choked by the prejudices and mores of the past, while a new a vigorous romantic spirit was forging ahead. Onegin was certainly a Romantic--as was Pushkin--whose ideas had exceeded their epoch, and who had striven to bring into Russia the spirit of the French revolution and other liberty-oriented causes. What drives the movie, however, and the story, is the passionate love of a woman, and her love for him. Their initial separation does not extinguish their passion, for when they meet six years later, and she is married to an aristocrat in St. Petersburg, she cannot be disloyal to her husband, and he cannot win her. Fiennes (the director) likens the story to a musical quartet, with a lean, streamlined plot, with a small cast, and played within a narrow compass, without the multiple action of the epic--which this movie could have been had it chosen to. Onegin offends by his behavior, but his superior wit and compassion alienates him from the narrow circle he finds himself in, fails both in love, friendship and social connections, and thus he is doomed to estrangement and separation. He is a man of his times, who really does not belong there. His rejection of the lady who loved him will haunt him forever, make him an eternal wanderer, whose passions remained unrewarded, and his life is spent in vain, and, in the final scene, he walks away into a road of obscurity and emotional non-existence.

The movie could have been helped by a more intense and experienced actress than Liv Tyler. Photographed in close-up, and when she does not need to say anything, she looks like an alabaster statue, but when in motion, or in emotionally explosive scenes, she falls short of conviction. A woman to be loved, and who loves so passionately--in a period piece--need not look as contemporary as she does. A Meryl Streep (or, as someone suggested, Gwyneth Paltrow) would have achieved the right dose of emotional depth--but perhaps not look as exquisite. Fiennes, too, looks worn at times, seemingly unable to rise to the violent passion he himself inspires. Used to playing haunted lovers, failed or evil characters, he is convincing as a displaced aristocrat, a man with money and status, whose progressive ideas separate him from his society, but whose passions betray him.  His experience, though, guides him through his last scene or two, when, crushed, he has to remove himself from an environment that could lead to distraction. This is a story in some ways resembling its Romantic counterparts--Don Juan by Byron (in a limited way), and Goethe's Werther, in The Sorrows of Young Werther. Romanticism of the early nineteenth century has not revisited our times in the same mass and size, for today's pretensions of it end up being froth emanating from Hollywood,  which endlessly dishes out cinematic artifacts meant to be light-hearted entertainment that presents a world that Flaubert would not have feigned to attack, or even recognize. For such productions are not more than sugared candy for spoiled children. Die-hard Romantics can find solace only in the past ages, or their imitations in film--which on rare occasions prefers honesty to exploitation.",1241568000,,5429,4.9823399558498895

She did the best she could and clearly gave a performance that stretched her prior abilities, but the director might be the one to thank for this.

Her body movement is clearly American and she, unlike someone like Rachel Weiz who can both look gorgeous AND convey intellectual fortitude, is not convincing as an avid reader and Old World aristocrat.

ONEGIN is a rather fine and lush and particularly correct adaptation of the Russian verse EVGENY ONEGIN (On-YA-gin) by Aleksandr Pushkin. Philandering playboy Evgeny Onegin, a rather bored aristocrat of St. Petersburg high society (Ralph Fiennes), inherits his uncle's country estate. He is amused at the provincial ways of the country folk and befriends a neighbor,Vladimir Lenski (Toby Stepehens).Through Lenski, Onegin is introduced to the aristocracy of the manor born class. A sister to Lenski's fiancee,Tatyana, (Liv Tyler) becomes enamoured with Onegin and risks everything by expressing her deep love for him. Onegin dismisses Tatyana's profession of love as silliness and breaks her heart. Onegin meanwhile has set his sights on Lenski's fiancee. Lenski defends her honour and is killed in a duel with Evgeny. We are pushed forward six years where Tatyana, now married to a Hussard soldier and integrated into Petersburg society, is spied at a party by Evgeny. He now has become entranced with the unavailable Tatyana and professes his love and she sadly informs him that he is too late and that she will honour her marriage vows.

Martha Fiennes has done a rather admirable job at capturing the times and the attitudes of 18th-century aristocratic Russia. From the lavish parties to a magnificently staged duel,Ms. Fiennes uses wonderful technique in assembling a beautifully scripted,acted and filmed movie that is very pleasing to the senses and very true to the time. Attention is paid to minute details in fully realizing this Russian masterpiece. Frankly, I am glad that this screenplay was adapted and shortened for viewing.

1088801,5,6305906807,"Russian literature has always been too complicated and epic for my taste. I bought this as a devoted Toby Stephens fan. After viewing the film, I was amazed to find out the story was originally in verse form. I fully intend to read Pushkin, in English of course. Ralph Fiennes as Onegin is tremendous as a jaded, cynical and tortured soul. Liv Tyler is breathtaking as Tatyana and Toby Stephens is delicious as Vladimir. All three live their roles taking the persona of the charactors they portray. This is definitely a keeper for me.",1179360000,2,534,4.691489361702128
1088938,1,6305906807,"The first problem with this film is that it thinks Pushkin is Dostoevsky. It moves very slowly, ponderously, like heavy prose instead of nimble verse. In the interview on the DVD, the director states that Onegin is a ""serious and complicated character,"" and she knows only one way to show this, by means of numerous shots of Onegin walking through snow, or outdoors, or about his house, with a gloomy look on his face, while tastefully moody strings play in the background.

This is a fundamental misreading of the book, much like if someone tried to film ""Hamlet"" as a slapstick comedy. Pushkin's book is not a straight-faced melodrama. Even when he's being serious, Pushkin always keeps a deliberate distance from all of his characters. But this film is very earnest, and consequently very boring. It is so intent on being ""serious and complicated"" that it totally misses the real nuances in Pushkin's book.

For example, the film portrays Lensky as an ""idealist"" who believes in true love. In reality, Lensky is like Olga. His ideals and poetry are a ritual, a way for him to impress a nice girl and marry her, which is what he really wants. He is still appealing, because he's too young and naive to realize this fact about himself. But the film doesn't quite realize it about him either.

Liv Tyler's pouty, vacuously sulking Tatyana is worse. Unfortunately, Tyler and the director both want to make Tatyana into some kind of misunderstood intellectual with (yet again) noble ideals, so they don't just show that she reads books, they claim that her parents don't approve of her reading books. This is ridiculous. Pushkin clearly says that Tatyana's father saw no harm in books, and that her mother was a fond reader. Furthermore, Pushkin extensively ridicules Tatyana's choice of reading material. This is intentional on his part: Tatyana is a very young, very sheltered girl. All her knowledge of the world comes from romantic novels. She falls in love with Onegin, first and foremost, because she's just become old enough to fall in love.

Apparently, the director didn't read the source material close enough to pick up on this obvious and explicitly stated fact, even though she claims that often consulted Pushkin's book for guidance. Worse still, the film makes up all kinds of crude nonsense. In the film, Tatyana is shown to be a discerning literary critic -- Onegin asks her if she likes Richardson, she replies that she found him ""too verbose"" (!), and then he recommends Rousseau's ""Heloise"" (!!). And then, during a dinner party, she suddenly expresses political opinions, and speaks out against serfdom (!!!).

By the way, it's really annoying how the film plays up Onegin's decision to rent out his land. The book mentions this in a couple of lines, but here it has to come up multiple times. Some guy denounces Onegin on the grounds that, ""in Russia we have no need for political experiments."" Well, I never! What an overwhelmingly astute, totally original observation about recent history, and so cleverly and unobtrusively worked into a story that has absolutely nothing to do with political experiments!

But back to Tatyana. When Onegin visits her in Petersburg for the last time, she pouts and breaks down in tears. Of course she loves him, but it's too late, you see. The audience cries, the show's over. This is somehow even more wrong than making her into an empowered and informed member of society in the beginning. In fact, Tatyana has no sympathy for Onegin in the end of the book. She remembers him only because his image is associated with her youth. She does say that her life is empty and hollow in the book, but it's not Onegin that's on her mind, it's her parents' house, her late nurse, all the comforting memories of childhood. In that scene, she is dignified and cold. In the film, Tyler engages in an outpouring of romantic angst. Sheer idiocy, is what it is.

But the film misunderstands and misinterprets the relationships between characters from beginning to end. The director understands romantic angst to some degree, but for all that she claims to admire Pushkin, the world he described is completely alien to her. Her solution to this is to turn everything into romantic angst, misty, gray and dull. The countryside is unbearably drab, and completely empty except for Onegin's huge mansion. Onegin's village is full of poor people in rags who get drunk and bow in silence before him (because serfs have to be unhappy, you see). The Larins' house is dark and full of empty space. Tatyana's nurse describes her life with miserable pathos, as opposed to the almost cheerful matter-of-factness in the book.

For some reason unknown to me, the director also fabricates some kind of conflict between ""city life"" and ""provincial life."" So Tatyana's mother is suddenly very concerned about appearing ""sophisticated"" and teaching French to her daughter. This is more idiocy. If the book is clear about one thing, it's that the Larins' household is gleefully, joyously ""provincial."" Tatyana's mother once dreamed of foreign lands, but ultimately she found herself in the daily routine of Russian rural life. It was not a prison for her, but a liberation. The director simply does not understand this.

Even Lensky is concerned that Onegin might view him as being ""too provincial."" This just makes no sense! Lensky studied in Germany, so he has more than enough ""sophistication credibility,"" not like he would really care. And the most bizarre thing of all is that the film omits his monologue before the duel, which is the one part of the book that could be effectively used as melodrama. The duel itself takes a very long time, in total silence, with a gratuitous slow-motion bloodletting.

Well, I could go on and on. Don't watch this film. It's not even good entertainment.",1178928000,24,5816,4.889452332657201
1088939,4,6305906807,"WARNING: Spoilers.

For an overall view of the movie, Anna Otto's comments are hard to beat. I can only add that the film inspired me to read the poem (unlike Anna Otto, in translation), and it was even more wonderful than the film.

I was only disappointed that in the reviews here Toby Stephens seems to be getting so little credit for his performance.

As he does in the original poem by Pushkin, Lensky (the character played by Stephens) throws the character of Onegin into sharp relief. Both in the poem and in the film, they make each other better (I think Fiennes' restrained performance might have seemed dull had it not been for his subtle playing off Stephens). Stephens does a beautiful and intelligent acting job in this film, perfectly conveying his character's idealism and naivete. His kalediscope of facial expressions -- jealousy, rage, pretending-it's-all-okay -- while his fiancee dances with Onegin is priceless.

Stephens' interview on the ""extras"" section is by far the most interesting, showing his thoughtful insights into the poem and the situations of the characters.

My only criticism is of the screenplay -- it's too bad the writers couldn't figure out how to bring in more of the humor of the poem, in which Pushkin himself is a character and makes fun of the other characters. It would have made the film a little less Merchant-Ivoryish. In the beginning they had Lensky teasing Onegin a bit, which again Stephens performed excellently, but then they completely dropped that aspect.

A must-have for Toby Stephens fans!",1177977600,2,1550,4.9652509652509655

I am a real sucker for melodramatic period pieces, and Onegin is a story befitting my description: passion, tragedy, regret, and unrealized desire. This movie is rather slow, but deliberately paced as to take in all the emotion (spoken and unspoken), particularly between the lead characters, sensuous scenes (cold or hot), and gorgeous backdrops/settings. And believe you me, seeing this movie again made me tear-up, especially at the end. The story is what it is, but I absolutely hated the ending. More passion should've gone into Tatyana's (Tyler) rebuff of Onegin showing up 6 years later with pointless and expressive love; maybe she didn't want to awake her sleeping husband upstairs... On the other hand, I just wished Tatyana took pity on Onegin and allowed him ""cousinly"" visits-- as recommended by her husband Prince Nikitin-- instead of acting the proverbial resentful ""ice princess"" and denying her true feelings for the man. Why stay trapped in a loveless, sexually frustrating marriage--referring to the ""conjugal visit"" between Tatyana and the prince--and not be with a man you have true passion/love for? Tatyana's elderly cousin's (Princess Alina) words turned out to be premontory of what her married life would be like: one without love and of convenience, but falling short of love outside the marriage bed. If I were her, I would take to ""visiting"" my mother in the country regularly... w/ Onegin in accompaniment!

1088946,5,6305906807,"This film is based on the poem ""Evgeni Onegin"" by the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin (1799 - 1836), that was also adapted into an opera by Tchaikovsky.  My wife, who is from Ukraine and grew up reading Pushkin, absolutely loved the movie and felt it authentically captured, as she told me, ""the Russian soul.""

Pushkin's poem contains a premonition of his own death, since it depicts a man's death in a pistol duel over the honor of a woman.  The challenger, seeking to avenge the honor of a woman he loves, and who he imagines to have received advances from another man, challenges him to a duel and is killed.  Ten years after composing the poem, Pushkin died at the age of 37 in a pistol duel with a French army officer who he challenged to a duel after accusing him of making advances on his wife.

This is a well-made romantic movie, with dancing between elegantly dressed men and women in large mansions with beautifully furnished rooms.  ""Onegin"" was filmed on location in St. Petersburg, Russia and directed by Ralph Fiennes' sister, Martha Fiennes.  It has excellent dialogue, first-rate acting, and beautiful cinematography, half in the city of St. Petersburg and half in the countryside, with gorgeous green forests.

The movie is filled with tragic irony and sad contradictions. Onegin, played by Ralph Fiennes, is jaded and cynical.  Yet, he has become so wise in the ways of the world that his jaded cynicism has become, itself, a form of naivete.  He refuses to recognize that real friendship and true love can actually exist, even as he senses it developing within himself, first in his friendship with a young man from a neighboring estate who is as idealistic and enthusiastic about life as Onegin is nihilistic and world-weary, and then in his romantic interest in the beautiful and intelligent young woman, Tatiana.  This movie has real substance, beauty, and depth.  The extra features on the DVD are also excellent; the interviews with the actors, especially Ralph Fiennes, are very interesting.

1089130,3,6305906807,"I regret to write as someone who hasn't read Pushkin's work - and so it seems, I was quite taken aback at the film's ending. Well so to speak, I was expecting something more tragic or dramatic - like Onegin being involved in a duel with Tatyana's husband - a reprise or retribution of his earlier duel with Vladimir - something along that line.

Given the relatively curt storyline, I'm little surprised with the director's treatment of the stills - they are done in probably the most evocative and subtle manner that neither compromises the mood of the tale nor bores with its treatment of ennui (although some visual interpolations were quite disturbing). Rather, it presents ennui with a jaded ardour, an aristocratic bearing that is most artful and befitting of the theme. Though all in all, the pace of the movie is slow - perhaps in lieu of the storyline, which many viewers may add that the written version of the work is more palatable.

Tyler as the ingenue is a premium choice for her blend of insousciance and boney, chiselled looks, while one can hardly find someone garbed in a George IV Era high-collared coat and immaculately tied cravat more dashing and perfect than Ralph Fiennes for the role of Onegin. Fiennes' debonair nonchalance is so effectively emanated to the point it becomes off-putting to the viewer and Tyler's contrasting transformation could perhaps have been played to greater effect by introducing more dialogue between the duo.

Not too sure if Fienne's hair was deliberately swept back to mark the transition or the reigning fashion - Onegin was visibly haggard - which perhaps justified Tatyana's response?

The costume was impressive - the styles were modelled closely to those of the late 1820s and early 1830s, with a clear fall in waistlines of the Empire style corresponding with the fall in shoulderlines. Hair was cropped in the shape of a vertical pole - yet perhaps the Russian style was considerably more restrained than its European counterparts in terms of adornments and lacings.

Amidst watching the show, I realized Fiennes would be the perfect muse for portraying, in terms of his chiselled looks, aristocratic bearing and brooding demeanour - the Poet of the Piano, Federic Chopin.

Whoever got Hugh Grant as Chopin in Impromptu would be kicking himself had he been presented with this consideration!

Ralph Fiennes starts as Eugene Onegin, a cad of an aristocrat.  We first see him in St. Petersburg gambling away his own inheritance and living a high life.  Then word comes that his uncle, who lives in the country, is dying.  Onegin makes it there on time to watch the coffin being nailed shut.  When the will is read, we learn that Onegin has inherited the vast land holdings, including hundreds of serfs and the splendid estate where he can live in luxury.  Onegin is bored and unfeeling and even suggests  renting the land to the serfs just because he doesn't want to bother with the responsibilities of being a landlord.

Toby Stevens is cast as his neighbor, Vladmir, a sensitive young man who writes poetry and is madly in love with his fianc named Olga. Vladmir admires the sophisticated Onegin for his self confidence as Vladmir is unsure of himself and seems to be trying too hard to please everybody.  Well, it seems that Olga has a sister, the beautiful Tatyana played by Liv Tyler, who steals the heart of the audience with her ability to show emotion with just a glance from her large eyes.  She falls in love with Onegin and declares her love for him.  But he cruelly rejects her and engages in a flirtation with her sister.  This infuriates Vladmir who challenges Onegin to a duel.

At this point in the film, I think I should have been fully engaged, feeling the passion of the story.  Instead I was a detached as Onegin, who goes on to have the tables turned on him when he meets Tatyana six years later.

I enjoyed the film for its story, its cinematography and it's acting. I also like the way it was representative of its times and depicted the frivolous world of Russian aristocracy.  I liked the direction too, especially one scene that depicts Tatyana, Olga and their mother hearing some tragic news.

Pushkin has managed to move one of the greatest nations on the earth to the core, to unify them for 200 years. Many Russians would say Evgenii Onegin is Russia's greatest literary work. But the original is in rhyme, a rhyme that feels sort of baroque and fairy-tale-ish to me, and that part of it doesn't translate well to the modern English-speaking range of sentiment.
A Russian sculptor friend of mine once asked me what the difference was between art and decoration, and when I had no answer, he said, ""Decoration is about many things. Art is about one Thing.""
Onegin is about one thing, and that one thing is faithfully preserved in this film. The film leaves out lots of lesser things, which point to this one thing, but you have to make choices to fit the world into two hours. That one thing is heart and mind of Evgenii -- what makes a man say no to that which he loves and wants above everything else? What makes a man deceive himself into believing he (and even she) don't want it? What becomes of such a man?
God is great.
Tatyana sees right through him even in her moment of greatest agony and she never wavers. It makes me dizzy to think how much pain I might have been spared had I had such insight at 17. And that aspect of Pushkin's story strikes me as beautifully unrealistic. As Pushkin said, ""A great story must be a little... hmmm... 'glupovat'..."" Perhaps 'dorky' would serve as a translation?

Isn't there a thing these days of taking some creative liberty with the original work ala ""Romeo And Juliet""?

That said, the acting and sets are very convincing and although you know what's going to happen next, the interest somehow lingers. Until the denouement in fact, when Tyler turns in a marvellously touching performance that more than makes up for her wooden countenance throughout the film, as well as mildly successful attempts at a British accent.

With lush costuming, beautiful cinematography, and rock-solid performances from a fantastic cast, 'Onegin' is an unusual kind of film. Moving along at a measured pace, it demands patience but also evokes obsession. We cringe at the inevitable, shed a few tears, and cheer at the final conflict. It's a story of love, tragedy, circumstance, and choices. I came into it with sincere doubt, certain my hopes would be dashed. For once I was pleasantly surprised at the restraint and dignity shown in the production and its conclusion. When all other aspects are stripped away, it becomes a tale of a woman's honor. It's not a subject often breached, and for this element alone hold my admiration and praise.
It also has one of the most stunningly picturesque and yet chillingly horrific dueling scenes I've ever witnessed on film. The emotion and intensity of the tragic cold winter morning on the docks builds to an inevitable climax and shows the profound sorrow that follows in the wake of a terrible mistake. I much appreciated witnessing the victor's anger, frustration, and sorrow over what he was forced to do in order to defend his good name. Was the outcome by chance or intention? Perhaps we'll never know.
Fiennes' sister directed the film and his claims that she has a ""sensual power"" over the camera are true. Every frame is full of romantic intensity. I do question her reasoning for moments of complete silence and the soundtrack at times is grating on the nerves, but overall I was very impressed.",1058400000,13,2140,4.914364640883978
1089280,5,6305906807,"This movie was my inspiration for reading Pushkin's exquisite verse novel ""Eugene Onegin"". I am usually familiar with a book before seeing it as a movie, but this time I was fortunate enough to see the film without having all my usual pre-decided notions that it could never live up to the book.
That said, the film NATURALLY doesn't live up to the book. A witty, Austenesque, slightly tragic Russian story is never going to quite make it on screen while maintaning every bit of the literary integrity we'd like it to. However, this film is gorgeous all by itself, and having seen it before reading the book, I can vouch for it being an excellent visual feast of obsessive love in two acts. If you've never read it, enjoy the opportunity to see the film as a FILM, and not an adaptation.
In act one, Tatyana is in love with Eugene and we are treated to beautiful cinemetography as well as the BEST dueling scene I have ever witnessed in a film. The costuming and stunning outdoor locale (on location in Russia!) is turns crisp and cool, foggy and eerie, wintry and lavish. Liv Tyler as Tatyana gives, quite simply, the best performance she's ever given. Very Pushkin. Very...Russian. (Who knew?) I have a big crush on Ralph Fiennes on account of this film. As the title role of Eugene Onegin, he delivers a very cynical performance that is very chilly without being downright cold. The end of the duel scene is a wonderful bit of acting where we see that Onegin is truly a person, capable of the emotion we see later in the film.
By ""act two"", the obsessive love has changed hands, and we see Onegin a changed man. ""Onegin"" is a  beautiful portrait of a couple that never quite IS a ""couple"", and an unsurpassed tale of passionate, unrequited love. The movie retains its Russian roots and fulfills all the requirements of a period drama, but maintains the integrity of the original slightly tragic ending and through superb pacing and tension, allows the viewer to take from it what means the most to them. Excessive action and dialogue never stifles the sweeping poetry of the film.
Watch it, especially if you are unfamiliar with Pushkin's original work... it will inspire you to seek it out.",1058140800,7,2194,4.625641025641026

But the Fiennes family really got it right-- a wonderful interpretation of the Pushkin masterpiece. Ralph acts & produces, Martha directs, Magnus writes an amazing score that you'd swear was authentically Russian. Amazing location, sets, costumes, script, casting, acting (see Liv Tyler bloom before your very eyes!), plot, cinematography & music!!

1089282,5,6305906807,"Sometimes the force of circumstances is just too powerful.
When Onegin befriended Vladimir, he wasn't condescending at all; and when the latter was down, his heart was so broken as when he was rejected by Tatyana. But being so sophisticated and well read, to be honest, how could he admire Vladimir's poems when he didn't even admire Schubert?  He was intellectually an avant-garde much influenced by Rousseau: he disapproved of serfdom and he was sick of the decadent life in St Petersburg. He was full of ideas and he even questioned the institution of marriage when adulteries were so widespread. And Tatyana for all her attraction she stood for,  was so young...
Onegin did spot the difference between Tatyana and her easy sister and remarked that a poet should seek for Tatyana instead.  Yet, young she might be, she was faithful and remained faithful despite the dreadful force of love. So in life there is, as in Dr Zhivago, nobility after all inspite of age and inspite of background: inspite of everything. But the notion of love in Russia in those days was too much a luxury, and through the influence of her family, her mother, grandmother etc she had to marry after standing against them for three whole years for Onegin's reply was still not forthcoming-- and it was not until another three years that Onegin had self-realization, knowing more about love and he was more than adequately punished for his lateness. But who can boast he knows love until he himself is ensnared by love itself? But the timing proves tragic to both of them...

Definitely one of the best films these years, even better than Tess of Durberville. Strongly recommended.",1056067200,5,1658,4.848056537102473
1089283,5,6305906807,"Somebody needs to give Ralph Fiennes' sister more projects, if they turn out like this one. An adaptation of Pushkin's romantic poem, this is a romance with feeling and a fantastic costume drama to boot. ""Onegin"" is a truly beautiful movie with excellent direction, and great performances by Fiennes and Liv Tyler.
Dissipated playboy Evgeny Onegin (Ralph Fiennes) inherits the country estate of his late uncle and travels there to decide what to do with it. There he befriends a rather excitable young man, Vladimir Lensky (Toby Stephens), who introduces him to the family of his fiancee. The fiancee's sister, the beautiful Tatyana Larina (Liv Tyler), catches Onegin's eye and his fancy. She falls in love with him, but he kindly rejects her.
A crisis separates Onegin from the Larina family, when Vladimir takes a warning the wrong way, challenges Onegin to a duel, and is killed. He leaves on travels, and a cousin tries to marry Tatyana off, even though she doesn't want to marry without love. Six years later, he returns to St. Petersburg and finds Tatyana is living there -- but is married to another man.
It's a simple plot, and definitely one where you wonder what will happen in the end. You wonder if Tatyana and Onegin will be together, you wonder if the end will be happy or sad, and you even wonder if both of them will live to the end. With a minimum of effort, Martha Fiennes makes us care deeply about Tatyana (a sympathetic character) and Onegin (a not-so-sympathetic character). The surroundings reflect what is going on -- the windy cold of St. Petersburg, the murky gray morning of the duel, and the sunny afternoon where Tatyana watches Onegin from her hidden boat. Another good effect that Fiennes uses is sound, especially after Vladimir is killed: Tatyana rushes into her house, crying and telling her mother and sister what happened. There is no sound, no music. All we see are the family's anguished faces, and it is all the more effective that way. The sweeping sets and costumes are outstandingly lush and beautiful.
Liv Tyler does an excellent job as Tatyana (my only quibble is that the hairstyles and clothes are definitely not what she should wear). She embodies the right combination of passion and quiet, like a statue that stays cool, distant and untouchable, until the statue cracks and all her emotions spill out. We gradually see that for all Tatyana's dreaminess and seeming spaciness, she's as solid and upright as a pillar. Ralph Fiennes is equally good at making us like Onegin, an idle playboy with a dislike of responsibility, who starts the movie daydreaming about a courtesan. And even though it was his own fault that he missed happiness with Tatyana, we feel sorry for him and wish that somehow their problems could be ironed out. His gradual awakening to real human feeling at Vladimir's death is one of the most powerful moments in the entire movie. There are also good supporting performances from Harriet Walter and Lena Headey as Tatyana's distant mother and flighty sister.
The romantics among you will love ""Onegin,"" and probably will be shedding tears at the finale. Amazing actors and direction that will knock your socks off, and one you should definitely see.",1044921600,103,3218,4.863387978142076
1089456,3,6305906807,"Alas, Onegin could have been a masterpiece, but instead is rather mediocre.  Two gorgeous people carry the movie, and visually it is a charmer (although it owes much of its look to Dr. Zhivago).  But where Onegin fails is in pacing and in making us feel the characters' motivation.  Why is it that Onegin himself, once a somewhat noble but disaffected rogue, becomes a simpering wretch over a girl (Tatyana, played by Liv Tyler) he once discarded quite casually?  Why is it that he discards her in the first place?  What happens to him over his six years of wandering that changes him so drastically?  His wandering isn't apparently a time of great suffering, but only when he spies Tatyana again does he change character quite suddenly.  It's not even that she can't be had--he doesn't realise she's married at first.  And when, in the movie, she asks him why he's changed, he says, ""I don't know! I can't explain it!""
Well, sigh...perhaps six years from now I'll write another review of this movie praising it to the skies, but for now, it's in my reject pile.  There are some good moments, particularly the duel, (and some nice foreshadowing when Onegin first meets Lensky) but not enough to redeem the whole. The slow pace of the film doesn't manage to create tension, but instead results in tedium.  Get it if you want to see Ralph Fiennes and Liv Tyler (fully dressed), forget it if you want a gripping romantic tragedy.",1042329600,8,1426,4.668

Ah, the sweet torture. The close-ups of Ralph Fiennes's ever expressive eyes. It was a love junkie's smorgasbord.
What do I know about cinematography? The film's a feast for the eyes. That's good enough for me. Direction? Martha Fiennes did a fine job in my humble opinion. And the score was hauntingly lovely.

1089459,2,6305906807,"Ralph Fiennes did such a superb acting job in The English Patient that I was prepared to like him in this saga. Rather than finding him portray a desirable and irresistable male who would make the object of his desires leave her Prince for him, his take on Msr. Onegin is one of a self absorbed, mewling cry baby whose sexuality is ambiguous at best. The scenes with his neighbor who hunted his forest and evolves into a ""friendship"" imply more and one can understand his reluctance to duel him over a provincial female whom his friend desires. There is a lot of covert, sexual conflict suggested. Fiennes chief expression is that of a pained and droopy sourfaced snob. It is only during the first quarter of this film where he is at all believable as an insufferable bore and self styled man bon vivant. After that, he just wilts.
Liv Tyler is so self conscious she never engages the role and she is ill-served by a hairdo that emphasizes her exceptionally large face which becomes repugnantly distorted during her grand crying scene. It is a puzzle why the director has her walking so slowly throughout the film such that it sends the message to the viewer of a vapid, stupid girl rather than the educated, vital and desirable character intended in the story. I found myself doing a repeat fast forward on my remote in hopes of surcease from the boredom engendered by this film.

Personal taste aside, the photography was very beautifully done and the scenes breathtaking, especially the pier where Onegin duels an erstwhile opponent. The mood of the times portrayed was captured albeit a military presence in Russia is mostly absent  apart from the few references of the Hussars in dressage at various parties in St. Petersburg.  Imagry is the message of this film, but you have to want to stay awake to see it.",1009152000,9,1814,4.6802507836990594
1089460,5,6305906807,"I thoroughly enjoyed this excellent adaptation of Alexandder Pushkin's Onegin.  firts of all, I commend Fiennes for his taste and decision to produce the film.  He must have known and loved this classic of literature.  He also filmed it entorely on location in Russia. The acting is just right and this is remarkable for this sort of subject, when actorsa tend to overact to show their dramatic talents as in some 'Period"" pieces, notably Henry James adaptations, Merchant & Ivory films and Shakespearan films. i.e. Golden Bowl, Room with a view and Hamlet.  Liv Tyler is well cast as Tatiana and she even looks like Ntalia Gencherova Pushkin's actual wife over whom he fought in a duel - and died very young - just like his created hero Evgeni Onegin.  Fienbnes is excellent as the noble Onegin. For some reason Fiennes is always very beliavble playing eastern European members of the high class.  Unfortunately many missed this film as it received very little publicity.  For the few it's very worthwhile.",1007683200,9,1007,4.8882352941176475

It's a downright depressing, miserable movie. Nothing goes the way you think it will, nothing works out right, everything turns out horrible.
But the movie is still one of my favorites. And no, I'm not mixing medications.
Performances are exellent, especially by Liv Tyler, almost surprisingly as she is such a fresh, modern actress. But of course, that's not all it takes to make a good movie. The script has to be good, and it is, very. Not at all bombastic, boring (well, only sometimes), or corny. And then the visual aspect has to be good, as well, and that's taken care of in the first five minutes. The scenery sets the stage for such a frosty, rainy, gloomy, barren tale such as this.
You don't walk away with a sense of despair and longing, however - and maybe you should - but rather with a sense of hope and endurance. Good feelings to have, especially after so much dreariness.

I was concerned about the quality of this film after reading that it was a ""Feinnes Family Project,"" but my fears were unnecessary; Ralf's brother and sister are as incredibly talented as he.
This film is a welcome addition to my collection of Merchant Ivory and Ang Lee films. If you enjoy the works of the Brontes, Jane Austen, or the Russian Masters (whether in book or film form) this is one DVD you will not wish to pass up. The extra footage on the production was interesting as well.

1089464,5,6305906807,"If I know that Ralph (pronounced Rafe) Fiennes is the lead in a film, that film becomes an auto-buy without knowing anything more. As an actor, he has it all. In every role he plays, I swear he's a different human being.  This was true of this role as well.  His mannerisms, the way he looks at someone, the way he even smoulders silently are entirely different from those same feelings as he portrayed them as Lenny in ""Strange Days;"" the English Patient of that same name film; Charles Van Doren in ""Quiz Show;"" and perhaps, most astoundingly, the brutal, fat, evil Nazi in ""Schindler's List.""  Usually actors this good aren't also tremendously sexy but Fiennes breaks the rule there too.  I've never read the work of the Russian author who wrote this nor have I studied Russian.  I have seen many Russian movies that were subtitled in English though yet never saw an actor in any of them who approached Fiennes in ability. So I think Pushkin and Russian literature in general should be glad that it was THIS English actor who got the role. When Fiennes was interviewed on the DVD, he confessed that playing this role has obsessed him since his own school days.

The role is of a wealthy man initially too dissipated to appreciate the innocent, beautiful woman played by Liv Tyler.  That changes at a later point in time when he becomes obsessed with her.  Tyler seems to be getting better and better with each role.  This is perhaps her best to date and lack of ability would really show up in a quiet role, which this was. The film itself is a very quiet movie except for the duel and activity out in the snow and ice.  Thus, any wrong steps by director Martha Fiennes would have really stood out.  I didn't see any mistakes.  It is a character driven piece and she remains true to that throughout.  Probably the scene that I'll remember best is when Onegin is staring at Tatiana as she skates on the lake.  He reminds one physically of his surroundings, especially his shards of ice eyes, yet he is so hot that he seems as if he's going to cause the ice to spontaneously combust. The costumes and settings are also absolutely gorgeous throughout.  It would have been a shame to cheapen up on the details since the rich Russians really flaunted their wealth in that period.

With few exceptions, they are empty and without talent, seeking pleasures and indulging in largely meaningless rivalries.  Onegin inherits a country state and there meets a family of local gentry.  He befriends them, but his coldness and lack of tact and caring eventually lead to multiple tragedies in a grand sense.  Some time passes and he encounters the girl he met so many years before, now a woman and married to his cousin.  Suddenly, perhaps because he can only desire what he can't have, he declares his love, but it is too late precisely because she is who she is.
