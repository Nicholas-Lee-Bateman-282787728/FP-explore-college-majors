1011560,3,6305342741,"After years of this movie not being available ITS BACK and on DVD also. After watching a ADVANCED copy of this on DVD (yes i have connections) I realize how much of a rip off this movie is on 20,000 legues under the  sea and 2001. But for the time period this movie is visual amazing remember  we are talking before digital effects like we see now. True the story is  good and some dialoge very bad and some acting bad it is still a timeless  movie and deserves respect and a look at. I applaude Acher bay for picking  up this title from Disney who did not want to have anything to do with a  re-release. Its a great old sci-fi movie and the kids will love it too.",922752000,,664,4.069230769230769
1011561,5,6305342741,"Is THE BLACK HOLE a movie with a sub-par script and mediocre acting? Yep, no doubt.  But it is also the most hauntingly beautiful of all the late seventies sci-fi movies, lovingly crafted with dazzling special effects and  an almost medieval set design. The score is perhaps the best sci-fi score  of the period, and it all contributes to a visually and aurually stirring  experience that transcends the rather wretched nature of the narrative.  Quite an artistic achievement, and this DVD is the first time since the  theatrical release that we'll be able to appreciate the film's qualities in  a crisp, widescreen presentation. (the previous video and laserdisc  transfers were cropped and close to unwatchable).",922233600,,714,5.147826086956521

1011677,5,6305342741,"The last and perhaps greatest ""manual special effects"" movie ever made, released between the original Star Wars and original Tron movies.  That ever-swirling Black Hole, ready to swallow everything, is awesome.  By today's standards, the plot is a bit thin and effects sometimes cheesy, and you can see some copycat elements of other movies like Star Wars, Logan's Run and Battlestar Galactica.  However, the film has adequate surprise elements and even hints of zombies, along with a star-studded cast and a great 15-minute bonus documentary of how the film was made.  An amazing achievement of its time, and a unique retro-movie that entertains even after 40 years.  There are a few short scenes where you can briefly see suspended cables because they didn't have the tech at the time to erase them from the film prints.",1521504000,2,822,5.014705882352941

1011743,2,6305342741,"You mean to tell me after Star Wars and Close Encounters came out in 1977 Disney had the nerve to put this out. I thought this was going to be a real gem, but it turns out it's a real 'stink-athon'. The acting, script and special effects are just terrible. Don't waste your money on this supposed cult classic. It might deserve three stars if I was six yrs old, no, nevermind, not even then. Two stars is all it gets and that's pushing it.

1011849,4,6305342741,Awesomely bad special effects and stiff acting really highlight this big budget disaster.  It is such a fantastic story and also has Ernest Borgnine and Max Snell. The effects and horrible soundtrack show what a cult classic like 'Dark Star' would have been if a huge studio had thrown a bunch of money at a production in a desperate attempt to cash in on the Star Wars craze.  (Yes I know Dark Star was 4 years before Star Wars but the point is the same).  It makes Star Trek:The Motion Picture look like Ben Hur.

1011857,4,6305342741,"If you're one of those ""nostalgic"" types (for lack of a better term) and enjoy camp, I highly recommend this movie. The plot and characters will feel like a pile of all the oldest cliches in the book, but they're done with such heart that you may not care. And dear god is this movie TRIPPY. The music is the best thing about it, but the opening and ending sequences are wild rides as well. And while I have nothing against CGI when it's used well, this pre-CGI scifi has a real, yet surreal, feel that cannot be replicated anywhere else. It's especially appreciated when the characters are simply exploring the massive, empty ship; a modern movie would likely pack those scenes with CGI doors and background music, ruining the effect.

My only complaint is Dr. Kate being set up with traits that begged for development: ESP that is never explained or elaborated on, and a father who supposedly died aboard the mysterious ship the crew finds. Her ESP is never elaborated on (can she hear people's thoughts? Feel their emotions like Deanna Troi?) or even given a backstory. (Is she a radioactive mutant? Half alien? An escaped labrat?) And once she learns the truth about what the mad scientist is doing, she should immediately have some questions about what really happened to her father and whether he's even really dead, but this is never touched on. Instead Kate ends up being a plot device, with her ESP being used to basically replace ""Star Trek"" communicators (making me wonder why both with the ESP in the first place, and not just give the crew communication devices), and being a chick for the young guy to rescue from the mad scientist in the climax.

But for such a campy movie these are easily forgivable flaws.",1498003200,,1723,4.6644736842105265

It's no wonder they bought the rights to Star Wars. I most definitely dropped the lights and popped some popcorn for this, riffing on it untill the credits rolled.

1012267,4,6305342741,"Like other reviewers, I saw this when young, and was lucky enough to be given an LP of the soundtrack, which I adored and pretty much wore out.  After many years, the soundtrack is back in print (Intrada), and when I started playing the fresh new CD in my car, my son was captivated by Barry's haunting score and started asking about the movie itself.  Based on other reviews which suggest that a 9-year old boy is the ideal audience for this movie, I decided to buy a copy and let him watch it.  I can easily overlook the movie's imperfections because I love the score, but I was curious what my son's reaction would be.  He enjoyed it.  For him it dragged a little during the dinner scene, but the robot shooting contest rekindled his interest despite being from the days of Pong.  He loved all the robots, but especially VINCENT and BOB.  He couldn't understand half the quotes VINCENT spouted, but definitely resonated with BOB.  He did not mind the dark ending, though he was sad about BOB, while Maximillian (who terrified me when I was young) proved to be a relatively tame villain by modern standards.  The movie definitely has two levels of plot and action, one for kids, and one for adults, and their less-than-smooth marriage is one of the movie's flaws.  If you are a kid, or a kid at heart, or you love electronic scores, you will probably like this movie.  My husband, who did not see the movie when young (though he remembers wanting to), was less enamored and wandered in and out of our screening, asking ""Is that Captain Nemo?""  He was mostly fascinated to see a young Anthony Perkins.
Update: The movie has turned out to be a real hit with my son, who has asked to rewatch it repeatedly.  Sometimes he sings the soundtrack while playing with his toys - he loves it as much as I do.  I sing part of it back and he tells me ""I haven't gotten to that part yet.""  Great fun - glad I bought the movie.",1468368000,,1914,4.38243626062323

The critics who may not like this movie are 40 year old men, or maybe some girls or women who scoff even at Star Wars. You have to see the movie from the eyes of its target audience, which I would put at young boys/adolescent boys and young men from about 8 to their mid 20s. It is a home run for them.

1012601,3,6305342741,"A crazy mixed up Disney attempt at capturing the essence of:
a) 2001: A Space Odyssey and
b) Star Wars.
Mostly a failure, but there are things that look as if well intentioned people proposed and pushed, and then got voted out of the production by ignorant bastiches.

First some of the good things:
- The spaceship design looks really good from the outside and it is different enough from the Lucas/Spielberg produced ships to merit mention.
- An attempt at showing zero G looks, not good, but fair, but it is something that Star Wars didn't even bother with, for example. Star Trek did it outside of the ships. This is Disney, of course, and we should remember all those science documentaries with strict attention to detail. Why should we expect less? There is even proper mention of things like 'event horizons' and other scientific sounding terms.
- The characterization isn't bad. There are: a misguided scientist (Tony Perkins;)  more 'reality grounded' characters; and, I even like the fact that there was villainy (Ernest Borgnine) in the side of the 'good guys.'
VINCENT's characterization, regardless of the physical design,  (Roddy McDowall) is actually pretty good, (only BOB - Slim Pickens -  is intended as, pretty sad, comedy relief.) The robot is a member of the crew, intelligent, and actually contributes to the plot.
The Captain Nemo character, while obviously derivative of James Mason's Nemo, is mostly a successful character.

And now some of the bad stuff.
- First of all, going into a Black Hole doesn't make any sense. So, there goes the whole premise. They could have made it a different, fictional, astronomic body or phenomena and I wouldn't have a single problem with it.
- The inside of the Cygnus is not so hot: flapping, painted canvas? Really?
- The toy-like design for Bob and Vincent is frankly, embarrassing.
- Same goes for the video game the robots play.
- Fireball meteors in a vacuum?
- Captain Nemo turned the whole crew into zombies? Then he gave them uniforms? What is this? Phantasm 1.5?
- I think the chick (Ivette Mimieux)  mentions they are looking for 'habitable life forms' or some other thing like that. WTF, other than Astro I don't think there are other whales in outer space?
- Why are there soldier robots in a scientific mission?
- What the heck is MAXIMILIAN doing aboard this ship? Even Nemo is afraid of him! Is somebody at Disney anticipating Saturn 3?
- What are all those (useless fodder) storm trooper  robots doing aboard a scientific ship?
- The 'mind trip' end is somehow foreshadowed right at the start, (though why is a Black Hole being compared to Dante's Inferno I'll never know,) and yet it still does not make any sense whatsoever: the bad guys go to hell, the good guys go to a gothic (single) arched heaven (shades of Fantasia?)",1448236800,,2802,4.764948453608247

It is everything a sci-fi horror sound track of the 60's or 70's should be.  This movie was the last movie Disney did tat was completely CGI free.  (Their next movie was TRON)  One would think that their special effects would be at the top of their game, but they really weren't.  If taken as a movie from the mid 60's it's great.  It has 60's ideals, special effects, cinematography, plot holes and it's wrapped up at the end with a preachy moral message.

1012721,5,6305342741,"While I am one of the rare people who LOVE The Black Hole and have the 5-star rating because it is one of my favorite childhood movies, I do NOT give Amazon's service 5-stars here. Just 1.

I could not get the movie to stream at all. I own both versions of the DVD and tried buying it on Amazon to watch it in HD (just wanted to watch it feeling nostalgic about my childhood at the birth of my daughter, which happened the same day I decided to get it), but the stream failed. My internet admittedly sucks and I should have just waited. It was HD in short bursts, mostly DVD quality in others, which is related to my internet (Im sure most can stream it in full HD). They let me download it, but in quality inferior to a standard DVD. That's not why I bought it... I wanted it in HD!

Unfortunately, there is no way to be refunded. I looked all over the Amazon website and found nothing. Perhaps I have to call, I don't know. Wound up getting Showtime JUST to DVR it in HD. At least until Disney gets off their butts and puts it out on Blu-ray. Hopefully not as long as it took them to release the entire score on CD. Sad.

As for the movie itself, I know it gets much scorn -- including from overrated, self-important ""scientists"" and ""critics"" -- but since when did ANY movie get all the science right (most of the time, movies can be laughable for science holes, BUT, we still love them anyways) and how many live up to Star Wars? It's one of the greatest of all time, so not a hell of a lot can. This poor movie gets lambasted because of the timing more than anything. It's a sci-fi movie that came out right after Star Wars! Well, screw the critics, I LOVED this movie as a kid and still enjoy it as an adult.

Maximillian Schell's performance as the mad genius scientist/tyrant is brilliant. The good robots, VinC.E.N.T. and Old B.O.B. are fun. The bad robots, and Maximilian and the Sentries, are spooky enough for a kid to get the chills. The rest of the cast also did a fine job in their roles. The plot may have been highly derived from a certain literary classic, sure, but who cares?! Like that's never happened? John Barry's score is dark, moody and foreboding at times, pure fun in others. The ending was vague and open-ended, but like that also never happened before.

And, please, people, it wasn't Disney trying to cash in on Star Wars (which I also love), it was written and started production before Star Wars (although, admittedly, the robots and laser fights were likely kiddied-up to appeal to the Star Wars craze of the day). The effects, although now dated, still were cool back in the day. The ships and sets were gorgeous... again, simply lost in the conversation and overshadowed by Star Wars and Star Trek, which have more fanfare and interest.

Plus, if anybody thinks that NOBODY likes the movie, just try to collect the entire set of action figures made for this movie. Despite only having 11 produced, you will have plenty of rabid cult fans bidding you up higher than most action figures will ever go, including right up there with the rarest of the rarest Star Wars figures! Take that, comparison-mongers! ;)

(And, in closing, more entertainment here than in Tyson DeGeek's entire program. And some would say... more science! Lulz. Ooohhh... @n@l science trolls will probably get butthurt. Sorry, no offense intended, go back to your scientist-worship and let me enjoy m childhood guilty please movie!).",1439942400,9,3438,4.5
1012788,2,6305342741,"Stunning model work! Limited by a previous generation overal FX work and human actors having far less personality then the zombie robots. Tries to be both 2001 and an action movie, all while staying a Disney film. Of course this can work. Disney bought out Star Wars. But this movie is a cause of why Disney needed Star Wars, not an effect of that purchase. The science is almost as stupid as Interstellar. But this one has lasers and robots.

If you are in the mode for good classic SF go rent Forbidden Planet. If you want to enjoy some insanely good (but uneven) model and practical FX work give this one a watch. It helps if you go all mst3k on the human dialogue, which is frankly awful. The acting and dialogue remind me a great deal of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea or any similar Irwin Allen piece, which is a shame as this movie was made almost 20 years later. It feels like a cheesy mid 60's movie that was made in the 80's. Just with better special effects. The fact that this was ever released after seeing what could be done both with 2001 and with Star Wars shows just how far Disney had sunk in the late 70's.",1439424000,,1126,4.2372093023255815

1012868,1,6305342741,"Growing up in the 80s, I remember hearing about Disneys The Black Hole, but I know I never saw it.  After all, when it was released in December of 1979, I was too young for it, but it was part of pop culture for the decade.  I decided to rectify this oversight recently, and that was a mistake.

Our story follows a group of scientists who have stumbled on a black hole.  And just outside of the swirling vortex is a space ship just hovering  waiting.  When they realize that this ship is the long lost USS Cygnus, they are compelling to investigate.  This ship was recalled to Earth 20 years earlier, but no one ever returned and they were never heard from again.  Making matters personal, Dr. Kate McCrae's (Yvette Mimieux) father was on board the ship when it vanished.

They board the ship and meet Captain Hans Reinhardt (Maximillian Schell).  He is thrilled to see them because hes just about to try an experiment of actually sailing his ship through the black hole.  He thinks he knows how to come out the other side, and cant wait to see what is over there.  Can he do it?  Is the crew safe?

As I was watching, I couldn't help thinking of the classic story 20,000 Leagues under the Sea.  As with that one, youve got a crew who comes in contact with a mad man.  Thats pretty much the case here.  In fact, I really felt they just changed the names.

Unfortunately, they didn't bother creating any characters, either.  Everyone is so flat that its hard to truly care about the outcome.  Im not blaming the actors since the piece was really too plot focused to spend time on character development.  Maybe thats why the only actor I was familiar with was Anthony Perkins.

Despite the lack of fully developed characters, the story is interesting.  I was wondering what had happened to the original crew and concerned enough for the new crew to want them to be safe.  Unfortunately, the climax of the film took things off in a weird direction.  I think I understand what they were going for, but Im not sure, which kind of ruined things for me.  And I cant leave out the fact that people are out in space without space suits in the climax, and how they are able to do that is never explained.

The special effects might have been great for their time, but now they are laughable.  While the swirling black hole looks great, the area around it is obviously a matte painting.  Likewise, some of the shots of the crew with space in the background are obviously married together.  Frankly, that didn't bother me as much as amuse me.

This was a PG rated Disney film, but even knowing that, I found it dark, and I don't just mean because the movie is set in space.  There are a couple of character deaths and one mild swear word I noticed.  I wouldnt recommend this film for anyone under 10.

Although, frankly, I wouldnt recommend the film at all.  The Black Hole was only mildly entertaining at best, and the flaws are enough to give it a pass.",1433635200,,2944,4.408921933085502

At times, it felt like I was watching Flash Gordon from 1980, due to its cheesiness. This movie seems to be a conglomeration of a number of different sci-fi movies or shows, such as Battlestar Galactica, the Star Trek TV show, Lost in Space, and even Star Wars. I was sort of surprised at how unsophisticated and stiff the dialogue was, coupled with some wooden acting at times. Also, while I like the soundtrack, it seems like the main theme song is overplayed throughout the movie. Finally, the setting seems a bit claustrophobic, which is a no-no in sci-fi films.

It dazzled me with its special effects and excited me with all its action sequences. I must have seen it at least a handful times at the theater and, of course, dozen more when it came to home video in the 80's. Over the years I watched it every now and again not really thinking much about it. Flash forward to 2015 and my 1st viewing of it on DVD in about 10 years. Also my 1st viewing on a 1080p HD TV. Wow, it's amazing how time can alter your view and perception of a film. As sad as I am to say it and think it, The Black Hole is a amateurish directed cluster $&()? of a film. Every aspect and nook and cranny of it!  From over used horrible musical cues to the insane ignorance of basic science principle. For example,  several scenes at the end of the film when the crew is exposed to space, yet they have no suites on to protect them. Something I never noticed before but really stood out this time. Also the nauseating attempt to create elements of Star Wars really came to light this time. Something I never thought about before but makes sense. Everyone was trying to cash in on Star Wars success back then and this was Disney's attempt. The fighting sequences also became very laughable this viewing. The robots just standing in a row and the goods guys shooting them down like duck pins. Of course the acting and dialog really stood out as extremely lame and bad. The lines they gave to Joseph Bottoms are extremely laughable and his acting is about the same. Even Anthony Perkins seemed so stiff and robot like in his performance. A little like his Norman character. And then there is the ending. Disney's idea and version of what would happen if you went through a black hole. That had us rolling when Maximilian and Dr. Reinhardt were laying on each other tumbling through space and then merging as one to end up in Hell?!? A pretty bold nonsensical ending to a nonsensical film.
I wonder what a 9 year old today would think of this film? Would they see the wonder and fantastic space adventure I did back in '79? Or would they see it for what it really is, just a bad piece of science-fiction cinema. On a side note, the picture quality of the film is horrible as well. The special effects are dull and colorless. Disney obviously did no kind of restoration when this hit DVD and it shows.

1013101,3,6305342741,"The Black Hole.  Here was Disney's attempt to compete with the likes of Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien and all the rest of the space voyaging movies of the time.  Seems like the mid to late seventies had a serious thing for space movies.  The Black Hole was directed by Gary Nelson and had an estimated budget of 20,000,000.  It was released in December of 1979.  The cast had some fairly big names for example Anthony Perkins well known from Psycho who plays Dr. Alex Durant, Ernest Borgnine who plays Harry Booth a reporter, Maximilian Schell you might know from Deep Impact played Dr. Hans Reinhardt captain of the Cygnus.  Most of the movie special effects from that era are hokey compared to todays standards, computer effects were very expensive and relatively primitive.  The Black Hole was one of the last Disney movies to be done all in house using mostly old school effects like matte painted star fields, miniatures and actors being hung by wires and such, that's the way they did it for fifty plus years that's what they knew.  The tale begins with the Palomino and its crew flying through space when they notice they have to make a course correction.  They soon discover a large black hole is the reason for their needed course correction.  They discover a mysterious ship orbiting the black hole and soon identify it as the Cygnus missing for nearly twenty years.  One of the Palomino's crew Dr. Kate McCrae played by Yvette Mimieux had a father that served on the Cygnus so they decide to make one pass to check it out all the while wondering how any craft can defy the gravitational pull of a black hole.  The Palomino suffers some damage and is almost sucked into the black hole.  During all of this the Cygnus had been totally dark seemingly abandoned but then comes alive with light and even puts out the welcome matt for the Palomino.  The crew of the Palomino enters the Cygnus and is introduced to its mad genius Captain Dr. Hans Reinhardt where at first everything is cordial but steadily degrades into disaster as it's learned that Reinhardt plans to take the Cygnus through the black hole.  The Black Hole used 150 matte paintings (large amount for a movie), robots on wires, animation for laser and engine firing all old school methods.  There's a small commentary by the former head of the matte department who was also the son of the production designer.  If you appreciate the old school way of how they did movie effects then you would probably like this movie.  Compared to modern movies the robots will seem lame, the sound track repetitive, the story and dialogue maybe a little dated but an eight year old would like them.  However I have to say some of the models and sets were very nice like the interior control tower set of the Cygnus, the hand painted star field around the Cygnus and the black hole itself .  The miniature of the Cygnus (the ship on the cover) is EXCELLENT and the cinematography was done perfectly.  Disney has a habit of doing some things perfectly and others disastrously and this movie is a perfect example.  When the movie opens (after the extremely long intro music playing to a black screen, little over two minutes) a star field appears with green grid lines forming and then you see an outline of the black hole and you go oh boy this is great.  That dissolves into a really nice star field (a hand painted backdrop mind you) that looks stunning and then we come across the seemingly derelict Cygnus.  The proportion and detailing of the miniature is excellent and the scene where the Cygnus lights up is very well done, it stands up to any other space movie of the seventies.  After we enter the Cygnus the movie takes a hard left into cheesyville when the red robot characters appear (you'll see what I'm talking about...).  Ernie Borgnine, some would say is misscast in a space movie but he did a good job.  If you want to trip back to the late seventies for a couple hours then this movie is ok but in reality a younger person would find it pretty lame.  I think The Black Hole would be an excellent movie to remake.  A modern high def version of the black hole itself, the Cygnus, less corny robots, a little better story and dialogue and this would be a killer of a movie, Hollywood you listening...",1425081600,6,4268,4.564304461942257

Unfortunately, it was made right around the First Great Shift in special effects - when ""Star Wars"" had just introduced the world to motion control cameras and real-looking science fiction movies (instead of B-movies with toy spaceships.)  The Black Hole got left behind, suffering from poor special effects and worse writing, featuring a plot aimed at 8 year olds that, in retrospect, could have been WRITTEN by 8 year olds.  See it for nostalgia purposes, and to marvel at all the effort that Disney put into the giant Cygnus spaceship model.",1424390400,6,639,4.6875
1013231,3,6305342741,"""The Black Hole"" came out in a period when science fiction was making a big comeback. ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" had come out a year or two before, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was already a classic, and the same year brought us ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" and the classic ""Alien.""

And in some ways, ""The Black Hole"" fits in seamlessly with those other movies -- the sets and matte visuals are absolutely stunning, giving the movie a real sense of epic emptiness, and director Gary Nelson clearly was attempting to create a sense of depth that most live-action Disney movies lack (""Like looking into Dante's Inferno!""). But it also has a hefty dose of cheez, with wise-cracking psychic robots and bloodless disembowelings.

While returning to Earth, the USS Palomino spots a massive black hole with a starship orbiting it. It turns out to the the USS Cygnus, presumed lost twenty years ago -- and of particular interest because Dr. McCrae's (Yvette Mimieux) father was on board, and the legendary Dr. Reinhardt (Maximilian Schell) was leading the expedition. Fortunately the Cygnus is in some kind of gravity-nullifying field, so they manage to dock and get on board the massive ship.

Dr. Reinhardt turns out to be very much alive, but reports that the crew is all dead. Yup, all dead... and DEFINITELY not those robots who look just like masked, robed humans. Their resident robot V.I.N.C.E.N.T. (Roddy McDowall) soon discovers that the more typical robots aren't very nice either, but that's probably the least interesting part of the movie.

While wining and dining them, Reinhardt reveals that his plan is to somehow pilot the Cygnus THROUGH the black hole, to parts unknown. Dr. Durant (Anthony Perkins) is dazzled by this and totally wants to join in, but Captain Holland (Robert Forster) and Harry Booth (Ernest Borgnine) are not so sure. As they try to repair their ship, they begin to realize the true sinister fate of the Cygnus's crew -- and that Reinhardt may not let them leave alive.

""The Black Hole"" is a movie that should be praised for its ambition, if nothing else. This is a valiant attempt to create serious, mood-driven science fiction in the ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" mold, but not so slow-moving or cerebral that it would alienate children who might be watching. And most of the time, it actually succeeds in this -- the movie glides along slowly, building up a sense of ominous suspense, while also dealing with some pretty horrific topics (and even killing off one of the crew in a pretty gruesome manner).

Nelson achieves a lot of this through the epic emptiness of the Cygnus, a ship whose interiors and exteriors seem to stretch forever, lit but lifeless. The sets have a cathedral-like grandeur, only augmented by the silent starfields that often look into the enormous windows. And almost every room is shrouded in deep shadows, giving the feeling that things are being hidden from sight. The climax is perhaps the most magnificent part, sinking the ship into a hellish red inferno as it crumbles away around the main characters, and bursting into a string of symbolic images in Kubrickian fashion.

So what is wrong with ""The Black Hole""? Well, just as a ship can't escape a black hole's gravity... ""The Black Hole"" can't escape Disney. There's a heavy dose of cheesiness that bogs down the haunting main plot, mostly coming from the nonsensical psychic powers (which robots have... WHY?!) and the cutesy-looking, merchandise-ready comic-relief robots. V.I.N.C.E.N.T. looks like a levitating child's toy, with a personality like that of an abnormally smug C3-PO sans any of the comedy, and he hangs out with a battered model who... speaks with a Texan accent. Not kidding.

And Nelson's direction also provides some... slightly odd performances. For some reason, every character speaks in an oddly affected manner for most of the movie, which is especially noticeable whenever a crisis arises. For instance, when Vincent is nearly sent flying into the black hole, Charlie says, ""What the hell are you made of? What if it were one of us out there?"" without a speck of organic passion, and gets the equally flat response, ""Vincent is one of us.""

This is particularly noticeable with Joseph Bottoms and Yvette Mimieux, who are easily the worst actors here, while Robert Forster is just forgettable. Seriously, just try to remember him when the movie is over. Fortunately, the more talented actors manage to wring some real acting from their roles -- Perkins is pretty good as a starry-eyed fanboy for Reinhardt, Borgnine has amiable avuncularity aplenty, and Schell plays his mad scientist role with genuine charm and subtlety.

""The Black Hole"" is ALMOST a great movie, with its valiant attempts to be more than just another cheesy space opera... and without the odd acting and the robots, it would have been. As it is, it's good if you fast-forward past the robot drama.",1424131200,,4899,4.920096852300242

1013432,3,6305342741,"Visually, this is gorgeous, and for a Disney film it's surprisingly dark. It's full of references to the Bible and Dante's Divine Comedy. And the performance by Maximilian Schnell as Dr. Max Reinhardt is pretty awesome. But as for the rest of the cast... well, you've got some real stellar talent there, Robert Forster, Anthony Perkins, and enough combined sexual energy to power a handheld eggbeater for about a minute. With the exception of Ernest Borgnine, they all look as though they are suffering from headaches all the way through the film. It makes you realize how much Hollywood, for all the dumbing down and general closed-mindedness, has matured when it comes to science fiction and Fantasy. There's no Han Solo factor. And V.I.N.C.E.N.T., a visually striking little robot, combines characteristics of C3PO and R2D2 without any of the endearing nature and simple HUMANITY that made the Droids such a wonderful treat for viewers of all ages.
I used to wish there were a remake of this movie with Robert DeNiro playing Reinhardt, but nah. They'd just ruin it. If Star Wars represented the breakthrough of a whole new way of picturing worlds beyond our own, Black Hole was the final hurrah of all the conventions of pre-SW sci-fi films from the Flash Gordon talkies to all those great old popcorn gobblers that Mystery Science Theater 3000 made such good fun oftransformed in the Disney crucible from something hokey to something grandly operatic on a visual scale. The ending, whatever its flaws, includes some gorgeous imagery...and basically none of it done with computer graphics as we know it. Just watch and consider how much was made by hand.

1013534,2,6305342741,"Watching this film was an ordeal and it took me three evenings and some fast forwarding to do it. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

On its way back to Earth spacecraft USS ""Palomino"" discovers a black hole in space with a spaceship nearby, somehow defying the hole's massive gravitational pull. The ship is identified as the long-lost USS ""Cygnus"". The crew of ""Palomino"" decides to investigate, but when approaching the ship is damaged and barely manages to dock to ""Cygnus"". Once on board, they discover the only survivor of the crew, the commander, Dr. Hans Reinhardt, a genius - and a mad scientist if ever there was one... And then the film really begins.

I usually like SF movies, even those which objectively speaking are not so good. I have a quite large tolerance to silly scenarios, wooden acting, poor special effects, unwillingly amusing dialogs and clich&eacute;s by bushels - so, even if this film offers all those attractions in abundance, this is not the reason why I disliked it so much. THE reason is that this thing was impossibly BORING to begin with and then with time aged like you wouldn't believe it! There is hardly even one interesting scene.

The film was supposed to be well budgeted, but no major stars appear in it. Maximilian Schell was well cast as Dr. Reinhardt, because of course the main villain MUST have a German accent to match his scientific title...))) On another hand both Anthony Perkins and Yvette Mimieux were at that time mostly burned out actors (she retired soon after and he already for some time played only in second rate turkeys) and as for Robert Forster and Joseph Bottoms, well, their careers never really took off. On another hand it is always a pleasure to watch the veteran Ernest Borgnine, one of Hollywood's ""workoholics extraordinaires"" - but his role is secondary.

The final scenes, which were supposed to be something dramatic and profound, were for me just a completely ridiculous and impossible to understand mess - a really sorry cherry on an impossible to swallow cake...

For the life of me I cannot understand how anybody could make such a film after ""Alien"", ""Close encounters of the third kind"" and especially ""Star Wars"" - it was hopelessly outdated from the moment it was made! Now some outdated films can still be enjoyed even today - me for one I actually like this pre-historic ""When the worlds collide"" 1951 thing - but not when they are THAT BAD.

I understand that some childhood nostalgia can cause indulgence to this film (I myself rated ""Neptune adventure"" three stars for the same reason) but not having seen it when I was a kid, I am immune to this temptation.

Two stars only for some nice lines said by a funny robot named V.I.N.CENT. Otherwise this film is a waste of time. Avoid it as if it was a deadly space singularity!",1411603200,,2837,4.730769230769231

There is an eccentric mad scientist type on board, who has taken over the craft an turned the entire crew into humanoids that only exists to serve his goal of eventually entering a black hole.

If you want a ground-breaking s'spectacular space Western, that would be Star Wars, not this film.

See if you can notice the homage paid to Forbidden Planet in The Black Hole. I'll give you a hint - it's in the set design of the interior of the Cygnus.

I appreciated the fact there was no foul language, nudity, or gratuitous violence. It is a decent story, and fairly good (but not necessarily scientifically accurate) science fiction. The special effects are good for it's day, and I really appreciate it is not completely CGI just for the sake of CGI. True, it is not quite the original Star Wars or Star Trek II, but it is no Waterworld either.

These old movies are enjoyable to watch because of the imagination and skill it took to produce everything from the robots, to the musical score. Modern movies are often about a certain movie star or certain music group instead of a well told story.

1014173,4,6305342741,"The Black Hole Bowling Score: 262.5 of 300

What, did you just give this campy movie from the end of the 70s a HUGE score??  Why yes, yes I did :]  For those of you not in the know I am an avid movie watcher with a LOT of time on my hands.  Using modern technology and a subtle mixture of both quasi and pseudo-science I have developed a formula for scoring movies totally unique to this business we call show.  It both quantifies the movie watching experience and has totally nothing to do with bowling.  It is, in itself, a thing of beauty.  A middle of the road movie would score 108, while a movie that was very much liked might hit a 192.  The Black Hole broke 200 and that makes it a true gem.  Here's why I scored it so high...

The Black Hole - we own the DVD (Hey Disney - where is the Blu Ray, come on now)

What's it about?
Group of space explorers in matching PJs ""bump into"" the great monster of the Big Dark Cold - a Black Hole, a long lost ship, the U.S.S. Cygnus, and her genius and possibly insane captain - Dr. Hans Reinhardt.  The back of the DVD cover says, ""A story of robots and humanoids.  Of human genius and madness.  And a spectacular descent into nature's ultimate mystery - THE BLACK HOLE""  Oooh, chilling.  Of course the second biggest mystery (natural or otherwise) is how to figure out tax law but that would be another movie entirely.

Ok, I get it - there are a few things we need to clear up right off the bat.  The special effects were a little wobbly at times.  I understand.  You can see the wires on the ""zero-gravity"" scenes aboard the Palomino and later when everything that could go wrong had gone wrong.  I also understand that the Cylons on the original BSG looked more believable than S.T.A.R. and his red-toned robot buddies (and BSG was a TV show... A TV SHOW).  I could spend hours standing here defending the special effects integrity of this movie but instead I will handle it this way:  Dude, this system uses a quasi/pseudo-scientific approach and if MODERN SCIENCE has taught us anything, literally anything at all, its this - you simply ignore any imperial data which contradicts your theory.  (pst, off camera I am totally willing to admit that you shouldn't have seen wires and cables holding people and props up - even back in '79.  Some of the special effects just didn't hold up, some didn't work to begin with but that doesn't mean that all of them were bad - some were/are wonderful!)

With that bit of nastiness out of the way, I loved this movie.  The exterior shots of the ships, the suspenseful story, the descent into madness (not to mention other scarier things) all captured my imagination and were just fun to watch.  In a world awash in outer space tomfoolery (Star Wars, Star Trek on the big screen; Battlestar Galactica and Buck Rogers on the small) Moms and Dads were racing their young Gen-Xers to anything and everything with a star field in it.  While watching this film today I was still caught up in the thrill of seeing The Black Hole - this isn't just your standard issue Industrial Light and Magic computer generated effect - Disney did all of their own work on this film and it still looks both beautiful and horrifying.  The story holds its own with plenty of twist and turns.  The music can only be described as epic (even by today's standards).  The acting was well done.  The good-guy robots are cute aaaand intelligent (Vincent has a perfect quip for every situation).  Ok movie dude, would my over-electronically-stimulated kids dig it?  I would guess the 8-10 year old bracket would enjoy it.  Snarky teens wouldn't get passed the spots where the effects let us down (plus there are no emo supernaturals - unless you consider the similarities between emo teen vampires and universe consuming black holes... hmmm).  Beyond that 30 and 40 something nerds are a shoe-in to love it.

What you'll love:
-  It's truly operatic... twists, turns, surprises, and some not so surprises and all done with Disney Magic
-  The special effects - the black hole, the matte work, the laser fights, the miniatures (which look anything but miniature on screen)... the meteorite (pst, meteorites are space debris that strike the earth, these would have been technically asteroids) destruction
-  It provides a playful and nostalgic romp thru nerdy Gen-X childhoods

What you'll hate
-  Those pesky wires and other visible (but shouldn't be) tools of the trade
-  It's a late 1970s outer space drama but has a 1950s feel (hey, maybe you like that sort of thing, it was retro before retro was cool)
-  Some of the storylines are downright scary and not suitable for young family members

The movie has an early 1960's type of feel and what people wrote as being amazing special effects didn't compare to the special effects from Star Wars to Close encounters.  The floating robots looked terrible and their movements even worse.  The story line is also boring and predictable.  What is even worse is the background music which is annoying and sometimes not right for the scene.  This movie would be rated higher if it was done in the early 60's.  It would certainly live up to being one of the better scifi movies of that generation and the corny music and characters would be accepted but for a movie from the late 1970's, I expected better especially considering the reviews on Amazon.",1366070400,,808,4.728571428571429
1014306,5,6305342741,"I loved this as a kid, thought it was an adventure of highest order. Watching it today, it is still a wonderful adventure that avoids all the trappings of modern films that try to present an origin story that makes the first 1/3 of any movie rather boring. (how many times must we see the hero be called to a rich benefactor and told of the dangerous mission that his team will embark on?) This movie dumps all of that and we are in for an old-school serial-adventure from the start. The effects many times work well, but sometimes belie their 1979 origins. The acting is suitably hammy, complete with mouthfuls of techno-babble thrown together to sound amazing. Some of the ""science"" in this sci-fi is dubious at best, including moments where you wonder how they thought this was believable. Some of it made me laugh when that was not their intent... but boy did I have fun.

Don't take the above as a slam on the movie. I really enjoyed it, In all it is everything it should be for a ""Saturday matinee adventure."" I just realize that nostalgia may be a large factor in my enjoyment. While that fact tempers my endorsement, I do have 3 younger kids that also enjoyed it greatly. Watching their faces and seeing the same reaction on them as what I remembered proved to me that the movie captures some element of adventure that everyone's inner 8-year-old longs for.

An old but great, well made sci fi thriller for kids that are more along the lines of Alien and Event Horizon without the pure evil and spilled gut. The set designs are awesome and inspiring, I made lots of legos of the main ship that I twisted to bits upon completion - simulating gravitational pull. The main ship looks like a mix between a Victorian greenhouse and the Eifel tower, filled with killer robots and zombie munks. Whats more awesome than that when you are 10?
This movie is best enjoyed on Halloween I think.
Watching it again as an adult, it looks very dated and cheesy, especially the dialog that comes out of the robot called Vincent. The ending is also weak but from what I heard, they made it up as they ran out of time.",1348876800,,773,4.26530612244898
1014554,4,6305342741,"I just watched ""Black Hole"" for the first time in decades, and I have to admit I was impressed.  It is a flawed film--scientifically bizarre, based more on theology to be honest, with an esoteric ending that makes no sense whatsoever--but still, a solid film.

I enjoyed the mood and atmosphere of the film most of all.  It is an interesting take on the Captain Nemo mythology of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, with a mad ship captain obsessed with his voyage.  In fact, more so than science fiction, this film is science fantasy on par with Star Wars.  It explores classic myths in a futuristic setting, with an operatic score that makes all the difference.

The special effects still hold up well. The USS Cygnus is stunning, with a palatable loneliness.  I remember being blown away by the effects when I saw this in the theater, and while I am no longer so amazed I am not disappointed either.

The acting holds up well. Everyone did an excellent job, and there are some top-notch talents in this film. Anthony Perkins in particular does a standout job, as does Ernest Borgnine.

With all the `80s flicks that have been remade recently, I think ""Black Hole"" would is due.  This film holds up as well as ""Tron,"" ""Battlestar Galactica,"" or any of the others.

1014555,4,6305342741,"Following up on the success of Star Wars, Paramount and Disney had took their turns for their own big budget sci-fi epics. ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"", and ""The Black Hole"". Fox followed up in the interim before ""Empire Strikes Back"" with their horror-scifi classic ""Alien"". Even Warner Brothers gave a semi-sci-fi effort with ""Superman"" and the unforgettable opening sequences. And TV had ""Battlestar Galactica"". We'll probably never see that kind of line-up of thought provoking steadily paced movies of sci-fi wonder that gave the audience time to look around again. ""The Black Hole"" had great story concepts even if the script falls short yet there are so many more positives that can't help outweigh and give a great trip ""in, through and beyond!"" With probably the greatest sci-fi scores of all time of those movies by John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, and John Barry. Barry's score for ""The Black Hole"" is a unique unforgettable ultimately ""swirling"" effective four note-plus majestic motif of doom and might, a theme that's just as good and rousing as William's intro theme for ""Jaws"". As well as astounding secondary themes and cues. The effects and production besides the lasers were completely classic old-school modelling and matte painting. All the stars in the space background were hand painted. As unfair to the unparalleled ""Lord of the Rings"" bringing up the mention of the ""Dwarf tossing joke"" , like the individually hand painted stars in ""the Black Hole"", each ring of chain mail was individually handmade and hooked together by hand by two guys in the Weta studio. Combined with the impressive visuals, the sinister ""devil-red"" Maximillian, the magnicifent ""Romantic"" Cygnus, and the stellar veteran cast; Yvette Mimieux was the Eloi ""Weena"" in the classic sci-fi 50's ""The Time Machine"". And ""Norman Bates"" gets a comeuppance before ""Psycho 2"". Amazingly, it's Maximillian who wins out as the most diabolical and creepy of the villainy roundtable this turn. ""The Black Hole"" deserves it's place among those big sci-fi giants of those few last years of the 70's.

I have always held a certain fondness for this film, even though it isn't one of the best sci-fi movies ever made.  My biggest problem with it is the curiously distant performances by most of the cast.  They are a cold and detached group as a whole.  The worst of the lot is Anthony Perkins as Dr. Alex Durant.  He is utterly removed, totally apathetic from everything and everyone in this film (even in his biggest scene).  The one who gives the most human performance is Maximilian Schell as Dr. Hans Reinhardt, the resident madman.  It probably didn't help that they were saddled with a barebones plot manufactured by 4 writers.  This could easily have been an episode of a TV series.  There was no attempt to elaborate on any of the elements in the story, even when they divulged some pretty intriguing secrets.  Everything was rushed, no time to linger, just grab the girl and leave.  If it wasn't for that fantastic meteor storm, there wouldn't be much to boast about.  It didn't help that they liberally ""borrowed"" plot points from better films.  I also wished they had designed the 2 floating robots better, they were barely more than cartoons, readymade toys.  But for all that, I love the look of this film, especially in widescreen.  It is elegant and visually sophisticated (except for those 2 roly-poly robots).  I've never forgotten the image of that enormous meteor tearing through the space ship Cygnus.  Spectacular.  I hope it's slated for release on Blu-ray soon.",1340928000,,1746,4.7725752508361206

The love and attention Disney Studios devoted to making this film stunningly gorgeous is immediately obvious to anyone who watches it and that beauty is really the point of The Black Hole. For sheer beauty, it is a Masterpiece that easily ranks among my top 10 and among the top 25 best sci-fi films of all time.

If you must have scientific plausibility to enjoy science fiction films, forget it, but if you are willing to suspend disbelief and enjoy a good story, well-acted, which is a visual masterpiece, don't miss The Black Hole.

1014678,3,6305342741,"While The Black Hole seems to endlessly be compared to Star Wars (an unfair comparison placed upon the film solely because The Black Hole is a sci-fi film released within the wake of the insanely popular Star Wars), its roots tend to reach back towards the more cerebral sci-fi classic 2001: A Space Odyssey. Certainly, The Black Hole never reaches the same heights in either popularity or ambition as those other two films; however, there is still something about it that will make you think of it long after you've looked past the film's obvious shortcomings.

The central plot of the film is one that's intriguing and rife with possibility and wonder and it's this set-up that is one of the film's only strong points. The basic premise concerns the exploratory spaceship USS Palomino returning from a deep space voyage, only to be diverted to a nearby black hole. There they find the derelict ship USS Cygnus seemingly defying the gravitational pull of the black hole, but the Cygnus has long been reported lost and the crew of the Palomino decide to investigate. Once aboard the Cygnus, the Palomino crew finds only Dr. Hans Reinhardt (the captain of the Cygnus) and a crew of humanoid, faceless robots operating the ghost ship. Reinhardt is determined (or is that obsessed) with unraveling the secrets of the scientific phenomena known as a black hole and the movie unfolds as his genius begins to border on madness...

From a story standpoint, this concept is intriguing and echoes certain elements of classic literature like 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea and Moby Dick, only set in outer space. While the story is intriguing, its execution leaves something to be desired and I think that's where most people have a problem with the film. Rather than a straightforward sci-fi mystery/exploration, there's a certain amount of Disney-ification to steer the film away from its more heady subject matter and instead focus on the family-friendly aspects like goofy floating robots and fairly unnecessary laser battles. I suppose these scenes were emphasized because no kid was going to sit still long enough while the adult characters wax philosophical about what might happen should someone attempt to enter a black hole, but for the adults, V.I.N.CENT and company get pretty old pretty quickly. Sure, V.I.N.CENT and B.O.B figure out a few plot elements, but it could have just as easily been the human characters. Unfortunately, the robot characters are clearly the target of the critics who view this film as a Star Wars rip-off - V.I.N.CENT and B.O.B. do look pretty similar to R2-D2 and the laser fights they engage in are a less exciting version of what you saw in Star Wars.

Ironically, the action scenes in this film are probably the most tedious part of watching the film. The scenes are pretty devoid of any kind of excitement, seem to ignore some basic rules of science (there's a point where the ship depressurizes, but this seems to have no effect on anybody - they just kind of float passively for a few seconds and that's about it. In actuality, they would be blown out into space and be dead) and they even try to wring out some pathos from the robots. Oddly enough, for me, the more interesting parts of the movie are when the characters are talking about the theories of the black hole (which is almost always seen just outside of the ship through windows, viewscreens, etc., thereby giving the impression that this phenomena is always looming over the characters and should impose a feeling of dread or anticipation) while the rest is just padding nonsense.

There's also another aspect of the story that goes largely ignored and seems to just fit the purpose of being a convenient plot device and that is Kate's ESP with the rest of the crew, including V.I.N.CENT. I have no idea what that's all about and no one really attempts to explain it - it seems to exist solely so Dr. Reinhardt can't monitor all communications between the Palomino crew. I know it may seem silly to pick apart this one minor plot detail (given that there's so many other areas to pick apart), but I guess I just didn't get it. It's one more fantastical element introduced for no other reason than it serves as a deus ex machina. Also, they make a point of mentioning that Kate's father served on the Cygnus, but that story thread never really goes anywhere either. In fact, Kate as a whole doesn't really go anywhere as a character either - it seems like she's set-up to be a central element to the story, but she mostly just devolves into ""token girl astronaut"".

The ending of the film is probably what will remind you most of 2001, since it basically reappropriates the starchild sequence from the end of 2001. The ending is largely dialogue-free and doesn't really go out of its way to explain what it is you're seeing exactly. Generally, I like this type of ambiguity because we can't say for certain what would happen should one enter into a black hole, but there's a definite implication of metaphysical properties within this particular black hole and it's all pretty heavy for a Disney film. The ending will probably go right over the kiddies' heads, but the adults will do a double-take and wonder if they really saw what they just saw. When I first saw this film as a kid, I totally didn't get the end. Seeing it as an adult, it makes more sense now and while I can't say it's a completely satisfying ending, it does leave you wondering. It also leaves you thinking that maybe this film was trying to bite off more than it could chew, but the ending fits with the more philosophical side of the film. From what I've read online, it seems as though there were a few different endings to the film: in the novelization, the Palomino crew is basically atomized once they enter the black hole and it's only Kate's ESP that sort of binds their conscious' together, allowing them to survive (in a fashion) - this ending would lend justification and be the payoff to Kate's ESP story thread that I had a problem with earlier. In the comic book adaptation, the Palomino crew survives the trip through the black hole and emerges in an alternate universe with alternate versions of Captain Reinhardt, B.O.B. and Maximilian. Another comic adaptation has the crew emerge in another galaxy (which seems to confirm Reinhardt's theory) and the read-along book has the Cygnus crushed in the black hole while the Palomino crew emerges safely on the other side of it. The DVD special features allude to yet another alternate ending that ends in an even more metaphysical allegory that involves Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel. Given all these options, I don't really know if one ending works better than another, but given the one that we got, it works within the context that I think the film was initially trying to strive for, and that is: a more cerebral sci-fi fantasy.

Bottom line: there's a reason that this film isn't more well-known than it is; it's got a lot of faults and it certainly isn't a movie for everybody, but I believe the central idea to be intriguing enough to get you wondering. A lot of people are wondering when this film will get remade and, to be honest, I hope it doesn't. Not that it wouldn't benefit from updated special effects, but I feel that today's generation will emphasize all the wrong aspects of this movie and ignore the more interesting parts. The black hole will exist simply because it's the name of the movie, but the bizarre majesty of it will be downplayed and I can just see a film full of ridiculous robots and lots more pointless action. I can also see this film being injected with a lot more humor and starring someone who can't carry a film; someone like Marky Mark or something. Should that god-awful version ever come to be, perhaps it would have the side-effect of making people reevaluate the original and promote it to ""classic"" status.

Personally, I hope this alternate universe with a remake of The Black Hole doesn't exist. If it does, then I'm staying on this side of the black hole and the rest of you can venture in and get crushed by the unrelenting mediocrity.

Just be sure to take V.I.N.CENT with you... I won't miss him at all.",1329609600,5,8184,4.710195530726257
1014679,5,6305342741,"Going through my movie collection recently, I found the 1979 Disney movie The Black Hole and decided to watch it. For those who may not know it, Disney currently has plans to remake The Black Hole with ""Tron: Legacy"" director Joseph Kosinski in charge of the project. If you watched Tron: Legacy, during the beginning of the film in young Sam Flynn's bedroom you will notice on the wall a movie poster for the original Black Hole movie. They were giving us all a sly wink, nod and glimpse of things to come.

While out on a deep space exploration mission, the USS Palomino discovers a black hole. If this discovery wasn't fantastic enough, they also discover a huge spaceship that sits precariously within reach of the gravitational forces of the black hole on it's outskirts, yet sits unaffected and motionless without disturbance. The Palomino crew decides to take a closer look at this ship that they soon find out is the missing USS Cygnus, which is another exploratory ship that was thought to be long ago lost decades earlier. The Cygnus seems to be dark and derelict but upon closer inspection, the ship is found to contain lifeforms aboard it. The crew of the Palomino docks their craft and investigates the Cygnus and soon are amazed to find that a Doctor by the name of Hans Reinhardt, played by Maximilian Schell, is still living aboard the ship, along with many robots that he has created to help keep the ship's vital functions operating. Reinhardt claims that the rest of the crew returned to Earth long ago while he stayed onboard the Cygnus to conduct studies and learn more about the black hole.

Dr. Reinhardt who seems more than a little megalomaniacal, has plans to fly directly into the black hole. The Palomino crew is shocked by this admission, but one crewmember by the name of Alex Durant, played by Anthony Perkins, wishes to accompany the Dr. on this fantastic journey.

Will Dr. Reinhardt travel into the black hole, and if so, what will he discover? For the answer to that, you will just have to watch the movie.

The Black Hole has always been a favorite movie of mine because it is a film that makes you feel like you are right there, in a fantastic situation, deep in outer space, on the brink of total destruction with no help from anyone to come and save you. You can feel the eeriness, the desperation, and fascination of what it would be like if you actually were on a vessel in deep space all alone with just a small crew of explorers in the vast unknown far reaches of outer space.

The film does have its fair share of cheesy moments here and there though, namely with the scenes involving its answer to the Star Wars movies popular droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO; this one features silly robots named V.I.N.C.E.N.T and old B.O.B., the Cygnus' maintenace robots.

And while some of the special effects may seem rather outdated by todays standards, they are still very effective at conveying feelings of loneliness and desolation when it comes to the black hole itself, as the Cygnus floats precariously on its outer fringes.

You've also gotta admire the awesome and menacing threat of Dr. Reinhardt's lead robot, the very intimidating Maximillian--probably the most scariest robot ever put to celluloid, and certainly one of the most memorable.

The Black Hole is a movie that I find myself going back to time and time again, and I look forward to seeing what the upcoming remake has in store for us when it is finally released by Disney.",1324425600,3,3471,4.669394435351882
1014680,5,6305342741,"If you have never seen this, please ignore the savagery of some of the other reviews here.  Yikes!  Seems like a lot of folks reviewed this after seeing it for the first time somewhere in the 2000s, or watched it for the first time since they saw it as tots when it came out in 1979.  Well, there's certainly no harm in that.  However, it's really not fair -- or useful in a review -- to expect this film to do any of the following:
1. Live up to modern special effects standards (1979...)
2. Feature bloody horrorshow moments with spleens flying off in every direction (it was a Disney film!)
3. Zip along at the (often pointlessly) rapid-fire pace of modern action movies (1979!)
4. Look fantastic on DVD when there was clearly no real effort to make that happen (sigh)

It would be nice to see a completely top-notch DVD release of this movie, complete with archival material, PDFs or galleries of the various movie cards, storybook stuff, and so on produced at the time (Disney marketing being what it was/is), extra surviving footage where relevant, and most of all, a cleaned up, digitally scrubbed picture that compensated for the unforgiving clarity of DVD/Blu-ray releases by painting out any revealed wires or so on.  Don't hold your breath -- the movie didn't fare well when released and has never been treated kindly by its owners.  So if the 2004 DVD version is too clear for its own good, remember that this wasn't something the makers could have anticipated.  I saw this film several times in the theatre and have seen it about 60 times on BETA, VHS, and DVD collectively -- and I've never really noticed wires or the like.  If this really bothers you, buy a copy of the older DVD release, which is even lower resolution...

As for the slamming of the dialogue, I really don't see the point.  The film is at least 50% gothic castle horror, complete with a castle in the form of the main control tower of the Cygnus.  This is consciously rendered in the film in a fitting noir style.  What's another film convention that rides along with such a style?  Melodrama, and that idea informs the dialogue.  While some of the lines might feel flat, there's some witty material here, and there are no real standout flop lines.  Compare this to, for a peripheral example, the dwarf-tossing gag in Lord of the Rings (Fellowship), which is a line that momentarily pulls you right out of the movie with its cheesiness.  LOTR is great, must watch/must own stuff and isn't ruined by even that sort of inane writing, so why all the depth charges lobbed at *this* old film, which has nothing half as silly in it?  It's melodrama, and usually rather intelligent melodrama, and if it isn't up to Shakespearean snuff, just remember that wasn't the point.  The question is this: does it distract?  If not, no worries.  If so, perhaps you are looking for a different sort of movie.  If so, fine, but don't fault The Black Hole for having a script that actually fits its own style.

The other thing I've found perplexing about some of the reviews here, including the heartless, humorless review welded to the product description, is the razzing the end of the film receives.  It's all visual, no dialogue, and therefore is slammed as a ripoff of 2001.  If this film weren't SF, would an all-visual end have been pegged as a 2001 ripoff?  If the whole film really *was* set in a terrestrial gothic castle, what then?  Considering the pressures faced by moviemakers to deliver easily-digested, nod-along fare (especially when working under the thumb of a company like Disney), the end of this film is fascinating, daring, and inventive.  It's about the duality of the human spirit -- the ""villain"" is surely deserving of a hellish fate, and yet it's his creative, curious spirit of genius that guides the crew to safety.  And yet it isn't a neat little snapshut ending -- *where* are they, anyway?  Will they get lucky and find out they can actually live on the planet you see at the end?  Nice stuff.

Sure, I've always found some moments to be rather goofy -- when are they outside the ship?  When are they not?  That gets wacky at the end, to say the least.  How does the not-so-good doctor figure out nifty mind control tech?  Why is the Cygnus so huge?  Why, exactly, are these characters so good at shoot-'em-up fighting?  The let's-rescue-the-damsel moment is perhaps a little *too* gothic-horror (and it's the one time the music tries too hard in an elsewise well-matched soundtrack).  If I'd written the screenplay, I'd have insisted on sorting this stuff out, too, just like some of the one-star reviewers here.

However, the whole concept of diving into a black hole to go see what's on the other side is a fanciful leap, and should be treated as such.  By extension, similar consideration should be given to the movie.  There's enough passable shipboard science at work on the Palomino to satisfy the nitpicker, but once that craft gets to the ""castle"", as it were, gothic fantasy takes over.  People have compared this movie unfavorably to the original Star Wars movie, saying it was an attempt to cash in, etc.  Okay, clearly the success of Star Wars made other movie houses interested in the genre.  Fine.  Go back and look at most of the dreck that came out in the wake of Star Wars -- unless you're into watching so-bad-it's-good movies for heckle value (I'm looking at you, Roger Corman), you know this stuff is awful.  Actually, I love the so-bad-it's-good paradigm (so thanks for some good laughs, Roger Corman), but I also realize those crummy movies made it harder for the good stuff to be properly recognized and appreciated.  There's no way you can put this film in the same category as rubbish like Star Crash or Space Raiders or so on.  Maybe you'd get more entertainment, heckle-style, out of those movies and their ilk, but you can't equate The Black Hole with them any more than you can equate Star Wars itself with them.  Are the laser blasts dated?  Go watch SW.  Are the robots cute/hammy/etc?  Go watch SW.  Does physics take it on the chin sometimes?  Um, seriously, go watch SW, where all the action is *consciously* based on WWII footage and so on.  (Yay!  Diving and banking in space!  ""Laser swords"" [that's what Lucas calls them, folks] that, erm, just *end* at blade length.  Et al...)  Do these things make Star Wars a stinking pile like, say, Battle Beyond the Stars?  No!!!  Star Wars completely rocked because it *was fantasy* and allowances were made for its stylized depictions.  It still rocks because when you watch it, you forgive it for having to be made sometime, and that sometime was the 70s.  So if high-flying Battle for Britain/Midway/etc. dogfighting, cheeky droids, and inconsistent mystical shenanigans stylistically fit the concept of heroic fantasy for Star Wars, then a sense of mad-scientist noir plus some Star Wars-esque 70s trappings shouldn't detract from The Black Hole.  Blasting this movie for it's time or style is like blasting, say, The Dark Crystal because the characters' mouths aren't always that mobile, or because the Gelfling race is scientifically doomed to deformations and so on if only the two characters are left to repopulate the species.  I'd put that film up against 99% of the dross populating any of the genres in which you care to place it, then or now; I think the same of The Black Hole.

So if you've never watched this movie before, just imagine a time when there was only one Star Wars movie, its knock-off clones were laugh-aloud awful, there weren't eighty zillion dollar special effects zap-fests coming out by the diaperload every summer, there was no instant movie watching/spoiling/reviewing/fan-editing/etc. on your computer or phone or combination phone/reader/toaster or whatever, there were 13 channels on TV and maybe half of them broadcast something (and if you missed it, tough), (and, well, there was no Amazon or any other place like it for people to write long counterargumentative reviews like this one!)  Imagine being hungry for some decent space opera/science fiction.  Now imagine hearing about a sci-fi film that *didn't* try to just knock off Star Wars or talk down to you every three seconds about the plot.  Imagine you can bring (within reason) your family to it because it isn't Alien-style dark (i.e. loaded with grubby characters that curse like sailors right up until their sticky, graphic end), but it's still dark enough to be interesting.  Imagine just sitting down and enjoying a good cast in a well-visualized movie full of style, atmosphere, and action -- all with a visually mesmerizing, thought-provoking ending.  Doesn't that sound, in context, like a good time?  I'm glad my family thought so in 1979, and I'm perfectly happy watching it now.

By the dialogue given them in the truly abysmal script, it's clear not a single one of the characters has the brains to ride a wagon down a hill let alone pilot a spacecraft across the galaxy.  The robots are a cringe-worthy attempt by some marketing genius at Disney to be cute rather than cool - one of many indications that the producers had no understanding of what sci-fi fans, including children who like sci-fi, are interested in seeing.

I'm sure he was the same Einstein who thought the final scene of the movie with it's dialogue-free drift through some kind of symbolic heaven and hell was all 2001-ish.  Except this idiot didn't have an Arthur C. Clarke on board.

John Barry's music score is a classic.

The production design by Disney effects veteran Peter Ellenshaw is outstanding. His elegant, cathedral like ship designs and robots are brilliant. All set against sea blue star fields, that give 'The Black Hole' an incredibly distinctive look- very much apart from 'Star Wars' or 'Alien'.

This movie had one big problem....it came out after Star Wars.  Had this movie come out prior to Star Wars, it may have been considered more of a success.  I had no problem with the story or the special effects in this movie.  Based on the time period, the effects were as good as they were going to get.  Those who complain that you can see the wires on the robots are sitting too close to the television and are spending way too much time trying to find something wrong with a good movie.  Bottom line is...this is a good movie that deserves to be viewed and appreciated.

1014684,2,6305342741,"The Black Hole(released Dec/79)is a totally weak scripted,talent laden juggernaut that should have gone into that black hole and never appeared again. Unfortunately for us it did....anyone have a phaser? I saw it in its' initial release run and just watching it again(for the first time in 32 years!)has not changed my first impression one iota.
You may or may not recall that Sci-Fi was going through yet another renaissance at the time with TV's original Star Trek now popular again and now out in its first motion picture. TV itself had Buck Rogers in the 25th Century and Battlestar Gallactica. The movies had Alien,Star Wars and others. A great time for Sci Fi fans like myself. This movie had great potential with stars like Ernest Borgnine,Anthony Perkins,Maximillian Schell and Yvette Mimieux. The special effects were top notch and still stand up quite well today,so where did it go wrong? Let's start and look at the tepid plot.
A space ship called the Palomino is heading back home from deep space in the year 2130. On its way back they pass a black hole and find,inexplicably holding its own in one place against the huge gravitational force,another ship. They identify it as the Cygnus,a ship that had been recalled years before but had never been heard from since. They go in and investigate and it is seemingly deserted. On one of their passes of the dark hulk an afterburner is damaged and they start getting sucked into the hole. They send their small robot called Vincent(voiced by Roddy McDowall)out to fix it in the nick of time. When they return to the Cygnus the ship lights up and of course they have to investigate.
They find a ship filled with ""robots"" and all controlled by one man,a Dr. Reinhardt(Schell).He apparently has calculated that he can enter the hole in his ship and survive. The crew of the Palomino have their doubts except Dr. Durant(Perkins)who goes along with Reinhardt. In the meantime,and over the course of the film,it slowly comes to light that these ""robots"" are actually the original crew of the Cygnus all turned into mindless zombies(hidden behind a reflective face mask).It also appears that Reinhardt wouldn't mind adding the crew of the Palomino to his collection. They also discover another robot like their own Vincent called B.O.B.(voiced by Slim Pickens),who is a beat up old thing but who aids in the crews elaborate escape from the doctor. However just as it seems they might finally get away one of the crew,Harry Booth(Borgnine),chickens out and takes the Palomino away by himself. Reinhardt blows him out of space. With no where left to go the remaining crew of the Palomino along with those left on the Cygnus,get sucked into the hole. The ending is a reach even for the most intellectually brave of all of us. After they come out the other side Reinhardt merges with his main robot,overlooking a Hell-like scene. We then see an ethereal spirit of some sort going through a long shiny tunnel to turn into the Palomino heading towards an earth-like world in silhouette against a bright sun,which surrounds the body with a diamond shaped light. Is it Earth? Is it heaven? A new world? It is anyone's guess.
Yes,that ending leaves one totally baffled. Someone was trying to equal or out do Kubrick's immortal 2001 and failed by light years. And that wouldn't have been so bad if the entire lead up to that point had had more grit and depth. The script is totally lame and could have been written by a first year writing student. The talent on hand do the best with what they have but you can't make gold out of geese. And the comic relief of the tiny robots of Vincent along with B.O.B. sometimes hit the mark but more often than not they don't. They also tried to milk some pathos out of old B.O.B. but that comes off as totally cheesy.
Technically this DVD has been transferred into its original a/r of 2:35:1. The picture could have had better work done on it,but is generally pretty good. Extras include a making of featurette and trailer.
All in all this movie gives the word""classic"" a bad name. It's a sorry yawn fest whose 98 minutes seem like one hour and 98 minutes. It's good for Disney that their next foray into Sci Fi would be a winner in Tron. But give this Black Hole a big pass.",1309392000,,4255,4.689839572192513

The presentation of this program was half way between a lecture and a sci-fi movie with terrific graphics. My wife and I were stunned when we watched this movie. My wife was on the edge of her seat during the entire movie. Some of the physics discussed were a little hard to understand, but we hung in there and were stunned by the final conclusion that we had no problem understanding. It was super fantastic. This man has connected every thing up with everything else...science, religion, pyramids and ancient Egypt, Von Daniken's ideas, astronomy, etc. We enjoyed this movie so much, we watched it again a couple of days later and understood almost all of it the second time through.

I just want to give a few thoughts...

I saw The Black Hole in the theater on New Year's Eve 1979.  This movie has great special effects but has a mediocre story, in my opinion.  This was Disney's first attempt at a science fiction movie and actually got a PG rating.  After Star Wars (1977) and Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (1978) came out, soon to follow were a bunch of science fiction TV shows and movies that had great special effects, such as Battlestar Galactica (1978 & 1980), Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), Alien (1979), Tron (1982), E.T. Extra Terrestrial (1982), The Terminator (1984), 2010 (1984), and so on.

I have good memories seeing this movie.  It has stuck with me for the last 31 years.  Like I said before, the special effects are better than the story, but it's good enough for me to give it a 4-star rating.

If you like late '70s and early '80s science fiction movies, give this one a try.",1293840000,2,974,4.488636363636363
1014798,4,6305342741,"While this movie suffers from the kitsch stylings and acting standard for Disney in the late 70s, it nonetheless remains a brilliant concept and a powerful story. Throughout the movie, the black hole itself provides a backdrop that gives the movie a sense of ominous foreboding. Maximilian Schell dominates the film as the insane doctor Doctor Hans Reinhardt. The movie has powerful themes, but as a Disney film is child friendly. For anyone who appreciates Sci Fi movies before the 1990s, this is a must see.",1289001600,,509,4.930232558139535
1014799,5,6305342741,"The first time i saw this movie was when it came out. I was 9 years old and me and my familly saw it on december 22,1979. It was part of a double disney movie day at the local theater in Corpus Chrisiti, TX. The theater was two blocks from the bay. It started off with The cat from outer space. Well seeing that one before i was being a 9 year old. Well the main feature, the black hole started at 715 pm. And for the next 98 minutes i don't think my back touched the seat or my elbows left my knee's, or my hands left my face. From the ever popular opening music score to the heaven and Hell ending i was completely taken away by the movie. From giant spaceships to flying robot's. This was at the time the largest, most costly movie Walt disney had ever made. And i still think it is the only movie with Walt Disney on it that still carries a PG rating. And for me this was what i called an open movie. Unlike ""Star Wars"" that had everyone running around corners the whole movie, unless they were in a desert. The Cygnus had long open hallways and huge rooms and sets. The Part were they come out of the elevator on the bridge, and the camera pulls back as the crew of the Palomino walks out. Truly an impressive set.

 Ok Looking at it threw a 39 year old's eyes. The visual impact was still there, it still had me going about how they could do something like this in 1979 but not in 2010. This whole movie had around i think 3 minutes of computer generated graphics, as a warm up for Tron that came out next year i have read. everything was model and live action. The cast was there,  Maximilian Schell, Robert Forster, Joseph Bottoms, Yvette Mimieux, Anthony Perkins, Ernest Borgnine, and the robots voiced by Roddy McDowall and Slim Pickens, and for what ever reason there names appeared no were on the credits. One thing is for sure, you can not mistake Slim Pickens voice! The big hang up sadly was the plot. It was a as cheesy as cheesy can be. This i was suprised in. Guess i did not remember it like that the first time around or when it was shown on HBO years later. Another thing i am still impressed with in this movie is the fact that it was what is now called the old studio way of doing a movie. Nothing, not one single set, or anything about this movie was done out side of the walt disney studio. There are rumors flying around that they wanted Lucas's new Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) to do the special effect's. But ILM was booged down with the second star wars movie the empire strikes back. And the other rumor states that Lucas wanted to much money. I think these are just that, Rumor's.

 The film is directed by Gary Nelson. Who had done a lot of the Disney live action movies we all know and love. He also played the part of the unhooded robot. Producer Peter Ellenshaw had his way when it came to Walt Disney movies. He had been with them for a long time and had a proven track record. In a book on him that is long out of print, it was released in mid 1980, there was a long chapter about the black hole. He said more than once that the studio had what he needed to make the movie in house. He said the only thing they never planned right was the budget, it went far beyond anyone's wildest dream's to recreate everything that they once had to make the movie, and the people they had to pull out of retirment that knew what was needed to be done, Peter Ellenshaw was one who got pulled out of retirement for the film. The Budget for this one movie was 26 Million dollars. 6 million of that was for advertising the movie. So 20 million on a movie was a big jump in 1978 when it was being made. Star wars had a 3 million dollar budget. ANd i think the Black Hole earned over 50 million in it's release. Probaly a lot more since being on TV, VHS and DVD. Wish Disney would do a blu ray version and fix some flaws of the original, Lucas did it was his re release of the star wars movies on DVD. And that went over with fans pretty good.

 I Still give it 5 stars for the ""WOW"" factor. And i give the ""Overture"" opening music composed by John Berry 5 stars as well.",1284249600,2,4093,4.12155388471178
1014800,3,6305342741,"...if but for a few things.

Before I take ""The Black Hole"" apart, I will say that when I was young, it was a movie I thoroughly enjoyed.  It's clean, clever and has some lovable characters (i.e. Vincent).  Maximillian was a great looking villan (though arguably a cylon rip-off).  It is visually wonderful and obviously had a lot of work thrown into making it an epic Sci-Fi.  The soundtrack was great.  The premise is great and I imagine that some day, it may be re-made into a truly amazing movie.  The whole mystique of the black hole is a great Sci-Fi concept.

That being said, if this movie wasn't competing with the George Lucas series of the same era, it still wouldn't have been a classic.  The characters and dialogue are comically weak (how many times have we seen the crazy scientist alone in space before?).  Many of the scenes and concepts are now, at least in the 21st century, laughable (i.e. when there's the hull breach in the garden and everyone simple walks through it without getting sucked into space, or even having breathing problems).  The ending was simply bizarre (did the doctor and the robot combine to become Satan?) and for the last 5 mintues, I didn't have a clue whether I was watching a bad heavy metal video from the 80's or the same movie.

It's a clean enough movie for some older kids to watch (there's God's name in vain and d**n, but no blood or sexual scenes) and it will get imaginations going, but I'm glad I got it cheap.

The story is just not that good, and neither is the acting or the special effects.  The plot seemed to be a combination of ""Star Wars"", ""Battlestar Galactica,"" and ""Star Trek:  The Motion Picture"".  There is one main diabolical enemy (like Darth Vader), his troops are all robots (like Battlestar), and they are also facing one great destructive force that is described as potentially having the power to destroy the universe (like the Death Star in Star Wars or the V'Ger probe in Star Trek.)

I'll skip over the special effects - a few scenes are well done, but on the whole they leave you with more questions and distract you from an already lacking story to be annoying.

As for the movie itself, it tries to do too much in too short a time - I can see this movie as a re-imagined mini-series, however. (The story has potential to be compelling and even inspirational.) However, the characters lack development, the story is rushed and the dialog leaves you asking yourself, ""Now where did that come from?"" on more than one occasion. The actors either over-act their parts or go through the motions and seem to be waiting for scene to end. Even the robots appear to over act.

This movie was Disney's response to Star Wars.

The story goes as follows.  The Cygnus was the first and apparently last of a vast program to explore the stars.  The Cygnus was as vast as a city and as well armed as a battleship.  It carried a large crew.  Unfortunately, after it was lost without anyone hearing from it -- space exploration went a different route....smaller ships like Palomino were sent out to explore the cosmos for life (mostly in vain).

As the Palomino with its small crew featuring Ernest Borgnine, a few other crew members, and V.I.N.C.E.N.T - the ship's robot, are making their way back to Earth they detect a massive black hole.

Caught at the very edge of the Black hole's gravity but not falling in they detect a ship.  It turns out to be the Cygnus.

I won't spoil the story beyond that but suffice it to say that the first 3/4 of the movie make great scientific sense.  Even when the pyrotechnics start, its wonderfully beautiful -- but the very last finale of the movie falls apart into metaphysical mumbo jumbo many times that's more reminiscent of the psychadelic 60s.  In its defense, the finale does tend to be somewhat poetic, is visually beautiful, but somehow it seems out of place for a movie that seems so well grounded in science for the first 3/4s of it.  Poetic ending, yes, beautiful yes....but the movie could have done with a more balanced ending.

The movie's special effects, acting, animation, robots are all great.

Beware though, if you saw this movie as a kid and see it as an adult expecting that same wonder that you felt as a kid - you might be dissappointed.  The robots look a bit rigid and like they're made of cardboard -- but VINCENT's and BOBs personalities steal the show.  The movie is dated, not quite as tightly woven as you probably remember.  Its a fun romp through memory lane though.

The dialog and acting is laughable and the special F/X are cheesy but the images and cinematography are absolutely beautiful. The exterior shots of the Cygnus are breathtaking and Commander Reinharts control room is fantastic. This is the kind of movie that in some ways looks so good you are willing to overlook its weaknesses. I guess maybe its how I would imagine what it would be like in outerspace even though I know that scientifically much of it would be implausable. I think the biggest problem this movie has is that it could never really figure out its target audience and therefore lacks direction and believability which is such a shame because in the right hands this could have been a very good flick.

1015029,4,6305342741,"In a review below, Dave observes, ""It's almost as if they thought they had a great sci-fi movie in their hands, but the contract said: ""kid's stuff"". ""

I totally agree. I had the same exact thought while watching this recently, for the first time in over two decades. It feels very much like a film whose target audience for the first hour should properly be adults and older teenagers, but one that's had kids' elements bolted onto it at a late stage. The scene with Holland rescuing Kate from the ""hospital"" later on in the film is the epitome of this, with the heroic-sounding overture (so different in feel from the rest of Barry's brooding, menacing score) feeling literally bolted on. Ditto for the laser gun shoot-out with the line of sentries on the bridge: a scene and an accompanying musical cue that feel totally out of place alongside the menacing first two acts with their slow-burning pace.

And, I mean, this is a film which [SPOILERS] has as its central revelation the fact that the original crew of the Cygnus have been turned into *zombified slaves*, and which has a central character killed by a robot that drives whirling blades into his chest. This is the stuff of horror stories. In terms of its atmosphere The Black Hole has a lot in common with dark 70s films such as The Stepford Wives and The Clonus Horror. It's shocking in retrospect that Disney gave it a green light as a mainstream film aimed at children.

Make no mistake, there is clunkiness throughout the movie, and a third act collapse. But if The Black Hole is a failure, it's a really fascinating one (a bit like David Lynch's ""Dune""), which is why I've given it four stars. The first hour is very slow moving, and kids would surely have been bored by it, but for an adult it holds a genuinely mesmerising quality, helped in no small part by the sumptuous set designs and John Barry's swirling, brooding score.

Great movie? No. Recommended nevertheless? Yes.",1208044800,,1947,4.6347826086956525

As they investigate, the ship is operated by scientist Dr. Hans Reinhart (Maximillian Schell) and his crew of robots who refused to be rescued because he wants to find the secrets of the mysterious Black Hole and wants to take the crew of Palamino with him.

Entertaining Sci-fi thriller from Walt Disney Productions is their first PG rated motion picture, sure some of the effects are kind of cheesy especially the two robot buddies V.I.N.Cent and Bob who look unrealistic and kind of cartoony but some of the effects are very good for their time. It's a fascinating and dark epic into Science Fiction that Disney thought up in the wake of ""Star Wars"" since it made Sci-fi and fantasy popular again but bombed in theaters due to competetion against december 1979's other Sci-fi movie ""Star Trek The Motion Picture"". As of today, it has built a small cult following due to it's nature and scientific themes, it's worth a fan for fans of stunning cult Science Fiction.

I got a copy of the VHS tape of this movie when I was in Med school in 1982 and any time I could not get to sleep I would put this on and I would shortly drift off.

Having seen this when I was young and optimistic may have a good part to do with why I am fond of this movie. In truth the story is silly and the acting resembles that of a poorly done high school play. Everything from the wise cracking VINCENT Robot to the dumb ""Scientific ESP"" angle is almost too painful to watch.
But there is ""something"" about this movie.

This is one of those movies that has many bad aspects ( acting, script, and story) but the bad parts all fit together to make something that is better than the sum of its parts. Sort of like a dog that is so ugly it's cute. The old Batman TV show was the same way, it was so bad it was good. This movie fits together the same way.

All that being said, the cinematography is excellent ( I did not say special effects) and the soundtrack blends well the images on the screen.

Like 2001, it is a nice quiet movie that is very relaxing and will put any insomniac to sleep.

Maybe it is only because it evokes a time when I was much younger but I admit I like this movie. And it is a better than using sleeping pills.",1201910400,2,1303,3.935361216730038

This films should have succeeded yet in my book it is an utter failure. The costumes, the incredible cast and the music all should have insured a great movie. Instead it is an overly dark, brooding film with huge lapses in logic and incredibly bad science that undermines any chance of enjoying the film. The characters act with no discernable or believable motiviations. The actors had to put up with scenes that are comparable to Irwin Allen's 'Lost in Space.' Go buy '20,000 Leagues' or 'Tron' instead!

On the other hand, the design and execution of the Cygnus (and the Palomino, too, in a less flashy way) are really stunning. The visual effects in general are beautiful, especially considering the technology of the time. The musical score is also very good, and the acting is really pretty solid, let down by corny dialog.

1015106,5,6305342741,"If you were around when this film was being made, you'll remember; so was George Lucas's ""Star Wars"". It was just a question of who was going to get to the box office first. Star Wars got out there first, which detained the release of Disney's ""The Black Hole"" by a few years.  It had been argued amoung my friends, back then, that if the ""Black Hole"" had made it out first, it would have done fabulously at the box office.  Unfortunately, once Lucas's ""Star Wars"" got released, ""The Black Hole"" had to measure up to that calibre of special effects and story pacing, which it could not.  So, saddly it did poorly in box office sales.

In fact, I was working at Magic Mountain's Showcase Theatre back then and got called to work one day as a technician on Disney's ""Black Hole"".  I can see the two scenes that were shot the day I worked the film when I watch the movie. That was about 30 years ago and was the most money I ever earned in one day for that time period. Disney paid their technicians well back in those days. Wish they had hired me on full time. It looked like a very interesting project to be involved with.

Anyway, this film draws from the concept of Disney's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", in concept, when you know the background of this film's script. It's about a group of space explorers who travel from the earth to a starship run by the captain who has changed all the crew into robots to serve his will, as he endeavors to make plans to go into one of the largest black holes in space; man has ever encountered. How it all ends, you'll have to view for yourself.

The movie is more slow paced in flow than Lucus's Star Wars. Still it has a good cast, decent acting and good special effects for the most part; with some story and effects flaws. The music is excellent; which helps carry the film's ambiance of spirit. It's a great film for the entire family to watch.  There is one human death in the movie and a host of robot death's in terms of the violence level, in case you are deciding if your children should see this film.",1187136000,2,2054,4.289405684754522
1015107,3,6305342741,"It's supposed to be about a black hole.  It's not supposed to BE a black hole.  Produced two years after George Lucas's space opera adventure STAR WARS conquered the box office, this 1979 Disney feature was made as an answer to that film.  It was budgeted at a then staggering cost of $20 million, and boasted superior special effects as well as spooky production designs, and to this day they remain among the highest points of THE BLACK HOLE.

Which is more than what can be said about the movie as a whole.  For a production designed to be an outer space epic, THE BLACK HOLE -- which involves a crew (accompanied by a floating and talking robot, V.I.N.CENT., voiced by an uncredited Roddy McDowall) trapped in an impressively immense vessel called the U.S.S. Cygnus perched dangerously on the edge of the titular mass -- plays out very much like Disney's own 20,000 LAEGUES UNDER THE SEA in space.  In particular, the commander of the Cygnus, played with scenery chewing glee by Maximillian Schell, is very reminiscent of James Mason's Captain Nemo from that film, only more ruthless.

Contrary to that Disney production about the travels of the Nautilus (and, yes, Lucas's FLASH GORDON-style space romp), however, THE BLACK HOLE is narrowly devoid of many important qualities required to even make it a near classic.  The concept of exploring a terrifying force in outer space is an interesting one; however, the script handles it clumsily not only in numerous grievous errors in terms of space logic (Did any of the writers know that you CAN'T survive in outer space with no suit on?) but with the lack of a compelling or interesting narrative to drive the whole show by.  In particular, the secret revelation about the Cygnus and its captain are not hard to guess.

Incidentally, although Disney commissioned a high-profile cast with names such as Schell, McDowell, and PSYCHO's Anthony Perkins, few turn in anything in the way of an inspired performance (Schell and McDowell fare best, but Perkins, along with his co-stars, is surprisingly stiff and lifeless).  As such, the audience does not connect with the crew or even feel more hatred for the villain, despite Schell's commanding performance.

The only characters to rise above this exception are the robots, particularly McDowell as the heroic and kitschily named V.I.N.CENT and Schell's ominous, scarlet-colored giant dubbed, funnily enough, Maximillian.  Although much of the dialogue V.I.N.CENT spouts consists of groan-worthy one-liners, he and his companion, battered up Old B.O.B., liven up the screen with more personality than their human counterparts.  (Although there are those who found them to be pretty cloying; my real issue is that they look like Fisher-Price toys!)  Arguably more so than his master, Maximillian proves to be a frighteningly nasty and formidable villain, his prescence invoking terror to the audience.  A scene where he attacks and murders one of the crew members is still disturbing today (it's not bloody, but it's still quite intense for a Disney film).  That he doesn't say one word in the film makes him all the more menacing.

It is widely agreed by many that the special effects I mentioned earlier are what hold THE BLACK HOLE together, although some of them reek of age, particularly some bad matte painting, but aside from that and the robots, the only other positive is the foreboding musical score provided by John Barry.  Although repetitive at times, it suits the dark tone of the film very well and is hard to forget.

The real problem with THE BLACK HOLE is that it's droningly dull for more than two-thirds of its ninety-something minute running time.  Much of that time is spent exploring the Cygnus with the cast spouting stiff, uninspired dialogue.  Things finally pick up in the latter third, but again, there are some serious flaws in the conception of several action scenes.  Most notably ridiculous is when a giant asteroid crashes through the hull and rolls down a massive hallway.  While this sequence is very memorable, it only serves as yet another example of the incompetence of the writers' lack of knowledge about outer space.  More detrimental are the noticeable use of wires to make the cast look like they're ""floating"".  Apparently the Disney crew forgot to matte them out, but it's still very distracting and unintentionally humorous.  As I mentioned, too, the scenes where the crew members are exposed to the atmosphere of space WITHOUT any space suits are utterly idiotic.  I can handle the robot V.I.N.CENT. floating outside the crew's ship to repair a panel and save himself from being sucked into the hole.  He is, after all, a robot.  But the scene toward the end of the movie when a crew member is lifted by gravity off the exterior of the Cygnus and almost topples into the hole itself really should have been cut.  It is stupid, and as mentioned, only highlights the ineptness of the production staff's knowledge of space... or lack thereof.

When everyone finally descends into the black hole itself, we get an extensively long, powerful sequence involving Heaven and Hell.  It's surreal and vaguely similar to the climax of Stanley Kubrick's 2001:  A SPACE ODYSSEY, but while it's an engrossing highlight, the whole sequence comes completely out of nowhere.  Worse still, it sadly undermines the epic premise and provides for a very baffling and frustratingly unexplained conclusion.  (The slow-motion sequence in which the crew is revolving inside their ship while hearing echoing soundbites from the cast is also very confusing; I get that it's supposed to be the surviving crew reflecting on their past experiences, but it still feels weird and very bizarre.)

The special effects, robots, and music prevent THE BLACK HOLE from being a complete waste of time, but considering how this movie was Disney's response to STAR WARS, it's unfortunate that it fell so short of potential.  Had it been in more experienced hands, who knows how THE BLACK HOLE would have turned out?  Apparently Disney recently green lighted a remake for this film.  Hopefully the production team involved can rectify the egregious errors that this film commits.  As it is, THE BLACK HOLE is more of a curiosity than anything else.",1185494400,4,6250,4.982658959537572

1015202,3,6305342741,"This movie is super dumb and cheesy, but I love it. It must be that 11-year-old effect, as that's the age I was when this came out. I had ALL the illustrated storybooks and models and fold-out posters... everything that was released before the movie came out. Ooh, I even had the LP that told the story of the movie with sound effects and dialogue! It was all in anticipation, however, because once I saw it I realized, even as a small [actually somewhat portly] 11-year-old, that this movie was DUMB.

Then I reevaluated as an adult. I tell you, a great deal of fun [and some small agony] can be had by going back to those Disney movies that defined your youth. For me it was the live-action period that yielded gems such as Escape to Witch Mountain [WHERE is the remake?!?!?!?] and such burnished turds as The Cat From Outer Space. And I saw them all, and for the most part, read the ""novelizations.""

Anyway, back to this one. This movie has some GREAT material, and some terrible material. Curiously, it seems that all the legitimately great material was provided by people who were NOT the director. The model of the Cygnus is cool. My favorite part of the movie is the shots of the huge ship silhouetted against the bluish starfields beyond, and the languid sequence in which the smaller Palomino drifts by it with its spotlight running over the latticework of the larger ship. The design of the red evil robot is awesome. The black hole itself is fascinating to look at [day-glo paint in a whirlpool]. Oh, and I love the opening music, and I like the green grid under the credits, though that's a little less defensible. So what it seems like is that you have a bunch of peripheral people, the model makers, the special effects folks, the composer, etc., giving their all and producing great work, which stands in shocking contrast to the rest of the movie!

The movie concerns a bunch of folks in the typical ""about to go home after X years exploring space"" mission. They find the black hole, then see the big ship near it, and go to investigate in the aforementioned favorite sequence. Then there's a slight action sequence in which they start to tumble into the black hole.

THEN you have the most hootworthy sequence of the entire film, in which it is revealed that the woman aboard is PSYCHIC. Not only that, but so is the ROBOT [with the big dumb cartoon eyes]. My favorite part of all this is the convention that the psychic woman, to convey that she's using her abilities, stares dreamily off into space, and the robot, to show that he's receiving the psychic message, suddenly snaps his eyes to face directly into the camera! That is SO precious.

Anyway, so their ship is--of course--damaged, and they have to land. They explore the ship, make it to the bridge, where the captain, who may as well be wearing an ""evil genius"" badge, greets them, along with his menacing red robot. Blah, blah, blah, it all follows a ""haunted house in space"" theme, until it is revealed that the captain made robots [cyborgs, I guess] out of all the crew and now they're--still the crew, just a bit less uppity.

It all has that charmingly nave dippiness of those live-action Disney movies, especially in its utter obliviousness to its own clichs. The robots with the cute eyes are obviously there to appeal to the kids [like I was at the time, but even then I could see that it was... obviously there to appeal to the kids]. There's this one sequence in which the robots play a video game... against a robot called S.T.A.R.... oh dear, it hurts. But for all that there are sequences that are kind of cool, like the asteroid shower. WHY asteroids are all glowing from within, and why one is perfectly spherical, and why they all show up JUST at the right time, is left unexplained, but it's still kind of cool in a nave way. You accept it when you know it's a Disney movie made for 10-year-olds.

Anyway, the other reason this movie is notable is for the ending. [I guess I have to put a SPOILER WARNING in here, even though in this case... anyway.] There is a lot of IDIOTIC claptrap about the black hole possibly being a PORTAL TO HELL [oooohhh!], and at the very end, the evil captain is shown INSIDE the evil robot [trapped for eternity inside his own creation! Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha!!], in this representation of a literal HELL, with red background, black jagged rocks, flames, the whole deal. The thing that cracks me up is that they just arrange the model on top of a rock and let it SIT THERE, arms in the air, utterly stationary, for at least a minute. It is kind of... appalling. I guess they REALLY didn't expect anyone over the age of 10 to attend this movie.

And WHAT'S with all that hyper-Christian moralizing, anyway? I thought we were watching a dumb space story.

Anyway, it's still fun and has a lot of good elements, all of which seem to have taken place without the participation of the director. Someone needs to take this and do a remake that takes the whole thing seriously.",1181606400,3,4990,4.535555555555556
1015203,4,6305342741,"If Walt Disney's 1979 sci-fi extravaganza, ""The Black Hole,"" must be looked back upon as a failure, it is an excellent failure. Granted, this sci-fi tale about the crew of the U.S.S. spaceship Palomino encountering a madman scientist (Maximillian Schell) whose own spaceship, the U.S.S. Cygnus, is impossibly perched upon the edge of a black hole, has some very obvious flaws in it. Some of the dialogue is cheeseball, the very *idea* of Dr. Kate McCrae (Yvette Mimieux) having E.S.P. with the robot VINCENT is just plain silly, you can easily see the wires holding up the actors and the robots when they are supposed to be weightless, and the actors should've damm well been wearing spacesuits at the film's climax, when they're crawling to the top of the escape probe ship in open outer space! (Why did director Gary Nelson let his actors get away with that one?) Ah, but still...I cannot help but thoroughly enjoy ""The Black Hole."" The film blew me away as a child, and now, looking at the movie again as an adult, the child in me had a wonderful time all over again---even if you can still see the wires! The main achievement of ""The Black Hole"" is the *look* of the film---it's outstanding. The art direction, cinematography and visual effects of this film are extraordinary (utilising over 150 matte paintings). The long, spacious corridors of the Cygnus look like they stretch out for miles, the Cygnus command tower is a total feast for the eyes, and I could go on and on. John Barry's rousing musical score is arguably the best film score he's done outside of the James Bond films (and when will it be released on CD? C'mon, Disney, you released the ""Tron"" soundtrack, so where's ""The Black Hole""?). And while the movie's screenplay isn't as polished as it could've been (Mimieux's line about ""There are old pilots and there are bold pilots"" still makes me cringe, to name one example), the film's basic plot is still a compelling one, and the movie has a suitably eerie tone to it as the Palomino crew walk through the massive corridors of the Cygnus, and slowly unravel the dark, terrible secret harbored by Dr. Reinhardt. Reinhardt's giant red robot Maximillian, with his huge frame and pulsating red eyes, is still THE scariest robot ever put on film. And the all-star cast of Schell, Mimieux, Anthony Perkins, Robert Forster, Joseph Bottoms and Ernest Borgnine are all good in their roles, even if these aren't the greatest performances of their respective careers. There's genuine excitement towards the end as the Cygnus is torn apart by the black hole and the surviving Palomino crew make a mad dash to the escape probe ship, and finally go *into* the black hole itself (and there are definite echoes of ""2001"" during this amazing sequence). And the film's surreal, cosmic ending, although confusing for many, is, for me, completely haunting and unforgettable (even if it does leave certain questions unanswered). It still disappoints me that ""The Black Hole"" was received so poorly back in 1979, and is not remembered with much fondness today. I just think audiences & critics at the time compared it too unfairly to ""Star Wars."" ""The Black Hole"" sure ain't ""Star Wars,"" but on it's own, there is much to admire about it. Though not an entirely successful movie, it's still very, very ambitious, and if nothing else it's a visual masterpiece for it's technical achievements alone. ""The Black Hole"" is a daring film that truly deserves another look.

The Black Hole is by no means a great movie but it's not a total disaster. Bad writing in my opinion is what hurts this movie. I agree with what one review I read said ""Belongs in the Nice Try Catagory"". The characters weren't that great except for Dr. Reinhardt played by Maximilian Schell whom we immediately see is totally crazy and evil and in fact looks it along with his red devilish robot Maximilian. The one character that I must say irritated me the most was Anthony Perkin's character. I don't say that Perkin's didn't do a good job, I think that character must not be very smart, now I don't mean in space science but in common sense. Perkin's character was so carried away by what Reinhardt had acheived that he didn't think twice about the situation and the warnings from his colligues went in one ear and out the other. Ernest Borgnine's character Harry Booth was okay but he seemed confused on certain things. First he tries to talk Robert Forrester into capturing Reinhardt's ship along with Reinhardt for failure to acknowlage the recall of his ship and the mysterous disappearance of the crew, and then he chickens out after learning what actually happened to the crew. The rest of the characters were okay and the afore mentioned characters were okay to but could have been better. I didn't understand the ending of this movie ether.

  To the things that were great about this film. The set pieces for the movie were great especially the design of U.S.S. Cygnus (Reinhardt's ship), production designer Peter Ellenshaw did a great job. I also loved the robots Vincent and Old Bob (Voiced by Roddy McDowell and Slim Pickens who received no screen credit) Why they weren't credited I don't know. I think most people would agree that John Barry's music score is terrific but then I don't know of one single John Barry score that isn't. The Cinematography by Frank Phillips was good as well and in fact went on to received an Oscar nomination I believe.

  All in all, this is an interesting movie to check out and I recommend you do so if you haven't. But don't expect anything like ""Star Wars"" or ""Star Trek"". This is a Disney movie and for the most part they did a nice job, it's just the writing that hurts it. Watch and judge for yourself though.",1170547200,3,2287,4.604422604422604

The Black Hole is probably their most ambitious attempt at serious science fiction they have done. It succeeds on some areas and doesn't on others. I guess it will really depend on the kind of stuff you are looking for.

The greatest success of The Black Hole is the model work. When you get to see the main spacship, the Cygnus, close up and the camera pans around it slowly it's a sight to behold. Other models like the survey ship Palomino look good as well. Not too much detail, but just enough to make it both believable and neat. The interior sets, while not top notch, are also impressive and give you a decent representation of the scale of the Cygnus as you see long hallways, large botanical gardens and a massive command bridge. Another VERY neat thing about this movie is the robot design. Every single robot is cool from the intelligent and witty V.I.N.CENT to the intimidating and tough looking Maximillian. The robots and ships alone are worth the price of admission.

The story itself is actually good, but it suffers from some odd twists here and there. This is especially true in the final scenes, which start to absolutely makes no sense whatsoever. You will wonder what they bozos were thinking by the time you get to the end. Another weak point in the movie is the action scenes. While some do the movie justice most seem to be put there just to try and add more excitement while not lending itself to the story whatsoever. Still both these shortcomings, as boneheaded as they seem, are fewer than the well executed stuff. Acting is good for its time and considering the production company, with Ernest Borgnine and Maximilian Schell giving the more dynamic performances.

Special effects are comparatively weak even for the late 70's with exception to the model spaceship work. Lasers and stuff like look tacked on. You can see the wires on the actors on zero gravity scenes. Stuff like that. The soundtrack is great though. You get a nice full orchestral piece that has both a grand and eerie sound to it. Hats off to composer John Barry. Conventional effects and lighting are mixed bag with some very cool stuff and some either over the top or half-baked stuff sprinkled throughout the movie.

There are various versons of this movie out on DVD. The ONLY one you should be looking for is the one that includes the ""Through The Black Hole"" featurette. These days it costs about the same as the other versions and you get a documentary that gives more detail than I expected (including an explanation regarding the horrible final scenes). You also get the cleanest transfer of all, digital surround sound, French and Spanish language tracks and the movie trailer. Considering all you get is the movie from other versions this is like striking gold for any fan.

All in all if you like focusing on the story or are really into robots and neat ships then The Black Hole will do you good. If you have to have intense and believable action then maybe this movie isn't for you. Keep in mind that this movie is by no means perfect. It goes off on some weird tangents that not even Stanley Kubrick would have come up with. However it's another one of those footnotes in the annals of the science fiction genre and is worth a look.",1169424000,4,3527,4.583201267828843
1015208,4,6305342741,"In a way, it's a pity that the Black Hole came out after (and because of) Star Wars as this movie, like so many others of the times, tried to be in part another Star Wars. And in that it fails miserably. And sadly, the Black Hole also tries to be another 2001: A Space Odyssey-- and in that, it also fails.

The problem was that Disney had a really great idea but executed really badly. I don't often use the word cheesy to describe anything because I think that word is over used by people who don't appreciate the effort that goes into the special effects of any time period compared to this one now. But the Black Hole's SFX *were* cheesy: while some were brilliant, too many were people and things hanging on wires that could be seen or less than great animation. Too many of the effects look sadly like they were made on a $1.98 budget.

Yet some of the model work for the spachsips were incredibly well done and some of the set designs were superior to anything up to that time. It's this combination of the really great and the incredibly lousy that makes this film hard to say that is a bad film. because in many ways, it isn't; it's a very good film bogged down sometimes by crappy special effects and bad direction, but overall the film surpasses it many bad parts to become something very enjoyable and worth watching. I only regret that while the widescreen version of this movie is fairly cheap, the full screen version costs twice as much! What's up with that?",1168473600,,1474,4.375912408759124
1015209,3,6305342741,"I really liked this film when I was younger, but seeing it again, it sadly doesn't hold up particularly well, at least scriptwise.  It has a great premise, but its execution is pedestrian.  Honestly, even when I was a kid, I think I just cut the movie some slack because I was naive, but I kind of knew it was a rather pedestrian film.  You'd think with Disney's money and the talented cast here (including the great Maximilliam Schell as the captain of the doomed ship), they could have done something really fantastic, but they didn't.  It's a rather simplistic rendering of a great idea.  True, it's considered a kids' movie by many (although it was the first Disney movie to get a PG rating, which was a real big deal back in those days), but still, you'd think they try something deeper.

The film, however, looks astonshingly good today.  The special effects are quite good, the ship is immense and fascinating, and the film was shot in 70mm and looks it.  Unlike another dated Disney movie, Tron (which was also PG, shot in 70mm, but is SO DATED now), this film still looks good.  I only wish the script was better.  Still, I like to watch it now and again.",1164412800,,1164,4.4739336492890995
1015210,3,6305342741,"So why isn't this film more memorable?  The sets are on the level of ""2001,"" the costuming and special effects are on par with ""Space: 1999,"" the casting is a nice gaggle of former A list actors on the decline, and the film has three of the most memorable robots in Sci-Fi-dom.  With all of these things go for the film, not to mention the power of the Disney name and distribution, why was it a thud?

First, the tone is dark for a Disney film--remember ""The Black Cauldron""?  The main character, Dr Reinhardt, is the space cadet version of Nemo and Ahab.  The cast merely reacts to him, and then gets away by the skin of their teeth.  But at no time do they turn the tables on the good doctor.  Thus, there is no hero, although there are individual moments of heroics of the film. The only person you can really cheer is VINCENT.

Additionally, despite having such a big cast, there is no chemistry between the actors, and therefore no chemistry with the characters.  This film is too asexual, even for pulp.  You just see conflict between Durant and McCrae, and after Durant's murder, McCrae spends the rest of the film being drug around the USS Cygnus by Captain Holland.  But not even a courtesy kiss.

Thirdly, the ending is weirder than ""2001.""  There is no closure, and no sense to the movie.  OK--I get the idea that Maximilian and Dr. Reinhardt got to hell, and get fused into one body ala Dante. And that the Good Guys make their way to heaven, then out a white hole. But this does not follow logically form the premise of the film.  I get the feeling I am seeing an off-beat ""Left Behind"" film.

But that is what we have with the film. I am still unsure how to salvage the film--a part II that deals with the recovery of the recovery crew?  Or just re-imagine the film for a new franchise.  Or did they do that already with ""Event Horizon""?",1163721600,3,1852,4.3654970760233915

1015273,4,6305342741,"The first time I watched The Black Hole, I was 5 or 6. Now I'm 32 and it was a movie that made such a lasting impression on me that I decided to watch it again.
I agree with some reviewers here on Amazon: It has its problems. Let's get some stuff out of the way: some claim the ending is simplistic: ""the good ones go to heaven and the bad ones to hell."" Not quite. 2 crew members actually die and disappear and they are not exactly ""bad"". The crew of humanoids also goes to hell. Why? There's no explanation for that. (Maybe it's because they're more robots than humans. Nobody spotted that?) The special effects: a bit stiff for 1979, yes. ""Strings holding the robots?"" Didn't see any. I was more concerned with the atmosphere and the story, and they are both enthralling. ""The ship breaks and the humans are not sucked into space."" Yes. But Cygnus created an environment where there is some sort of gravity, remember? Well, if someone wants to attack a sci-fi movie, they might even claim that Stephen Hawking didn't wrote it, so it's totally wrong. It's fantasy, folks! ""The dialogue is clunky."" Yes, it is, but the target audience was supposed to be children so I don't see any problem there, although the line ""what cause the cause"" was very unfortunate... the ""heroic"" music does seem overdubbed and makes one cringe, when Holland saves Kate... but the rest is effective, and in fact, the title theme, by John Barry, recreates the spiral of the black hole in a poetic and powerful way.

The Black Hole was a flop at box office. I have a theory for that. There's something rarely mentioned - this is a hybrid film, the target audience are kids (and I know I was overwhelmed at 5) but it has a gloomy side to it. The basic premise is actually quite dark for children, and more adult oriented. The black hole is death, of course, it's the unknown. The mad scientist is trying to be God and turned his former crew into humanoids, living dead! In the end, he gets trapped inside a machine forever! This is almost like a myth or a sinister fable. The good guys go to heaven, yes, and the bad ones to hell. It's a legitimate way to see things, I think. But don't forget the film ends at this point. It's not Herbie by any means!
On the art direction department, the film aged well. The Cygnus is probably the most beautiful ship in sci-fi movies. The black hole is menacing although the effect in itself seems simple. In the days before CGI and computers, filmmakers had to press it on the ideas department. This movie has plenty of interesting thoughts. If The Black Hole were made today we'd probably get state of the art effects and cardboard actors, and some big name director making a fool of himself, like Fincher on Alien 3.

The movie doesn't work at full tilt because it mixes adult elements with light ones: the 2 funny robots with the gloomy atmosphere, the vision of hell and the sombre hallways and light dialogue. The shredding of Alex Durant (Anthony Perkins) was quite scary for me as a child, and it doesn't quite gel with the cheery aspects of the film, like the funny robots talk. It's unbalanced. It's almost as if they thought they had a great sci-fi movie in their hands, but the contract said: ""kid's stuff"". If some of the light elements were taken away, and the dialogue was worked over, this could be a dark masterpiece. Nevertheless, it remains an interesting film, it's truly the dark side of Disney. It doesn't seem a Disney movie at all, and it's much darker in tone than Star Wars for sure.

1015274,4,6305342741,"Capt. Don Holland (Robert Forester), Lt. Charles Pizer (Joseph Bottoms), Harry Booth (Ernest Borgnine), Dr. Alex Durant (Anthony Perkins), Dr. Kate McCree (Yvette Mimieux) and their droid VINCENT (Roddy McDowall) are the crewmembers of the spacecraft Palomino.  While exploring deep space, they come upon an apparently abandoned spacecraft hovering near a large black hole.  However, the spacecraft is far from abandoned.  It turns out to be the USS Cygnus, commanded by Dr. Hans Reinhardt (Maximillian Schell).  Originally sent into space to search for intelligent life on other planets, Reinhart disobeyed the order to return to earth after his mission was deemed a failure.  He has spent the past twenty years formulating a way to journey through the black hole.

Dr. McCree's father was a member of the crew, but when the Palomino docks with the Cygnus, there is no evidence of the crewmembers anywhere; only Reinhardt and several of the robots he created. Reinhardt tells the others of his plan to enter the black hole.  Alex is immediately intrigued by the possibility and decides to stay aboard.  Capt. Holland senses something is up with Reinhardt and sets out to prove his suspicions are true.  Even little VINCENT has stumbled upon some important information.  He discovered another droid that looks like himself: BOB.  BOB informs VINCENT that the crew didn't die but in fact have become humanoid servants of Reinhardt.

Just as Reinhardt is about to take the Cygnus into the black hole, a large meteor shower strikes the ship and causes severe damage.  Harry Booth tried to escape from the ship by himself aboard the Palomino, but Reinhardt's evil robot Maximillian shot the ship down.  Maximillian also turned his evil ways on Alex.  Only Capt. Holland, Charlie, Kate, and VINCENT are left.  Their only hope of escaping to safety is to reach Reinhardt's probe ship.  Will they make it before it's too late?

This is a very good movie.  The special effects are good, considering the movie was made in 1979.  The swirling black hole is especially well-done.  The meteor shower was exciting to watch, especially the large meteor that strikes the Cygnus and rolls down the middle of the ship.  The acting is good, and the story is well-conceived. Science fiction fans will be sure to enjoy this fine movie from Disney.

But the flaws are so painfully fatal...I have been fond of this film since I was a child and in later years realized just how close they came to greatness.  What's great: it is the most visually stunning sci-fi film ever made (the wayward Cygnus ship, while completely impractical for its supposed purpose, is a masterpiece of sci-fi gothic weirdness), inspired casting and performances (notably from Maximilian Schell as the mad Dr. Reinhardt, Anthony Perkins as impressionable science officer Alex, cowardly reporter Ernest Borgnine, and stalwart commander Robert Forrester), a fantastic premise, majestic musical score in parts (but not so great in other parts), a wildly trippy but nonsensical ending worthy of ""Clockwork Orange"" mixed with ""Fantasia"", and one of the most genuinely frightening villains ever in the mechanized Frankenstein monster created by Reinhardt named Maximilian.  With such a great premise and dark atmosphere, it is shocking at how cheesy and just plain bad the dialogue is.  Perhaps it is the fact that it was a Disney film, they couldn't fully commit to the dark masterpiece they almost had on their hands.  The cheesy robots Vincent and `Old Bob' are hard to take (clearly created to attract the kids, Disney tried to create another R2D2 and C3PO).  Some of the supporting cast falls off precipitously from the quality of the big names.  The action sequences could have been done a lot better as well.

And Maximillian, you gotta be afraid of his paper shredder hands. So damned comical.

When I was young, I thought that the visual effect of the black hole looked cool. But even way back when the movie was made the theory of the black hole is that it could not be seen. Well, it's bright as day in this movie. But I suppose the had to display it movie purposes.

The special effects in this movie were obviously some sort of bad after thought because there was no detail to them whatsoever. The laser blasts are aweful and the robots move stiffly if they come across anything that isn't a flat surface they'd topple over.

(5)The science is absurd. (6) The blood-red Maximilian robot always seems nothing more than a dangling shell with a red light inside. (7) V.I.N.CENT and B.O.B. are way too cutesy.

I was hoping for a few more documentaries, even a commentary track.  But given that it's not that popular of a movie, or even a critically acclaimed one, I doubted that would happen.  The documentary provided on the disc gave me a respect for the processes and technological breakthroughs (of the time)for the Black Hole.

As for the film itself...There are some films out there that no matter how ""stiff"" or ""bad"" the acting, how ""horrible"" the plot, how ""cheesy"" the dialog, how un-scientific certain elements of the film may be (even though the film is labeled Science Fiction...emphasis on Fiction) you will genuinely enjoy and grow to have a real fondness for, despite it's perceived flaws.

The Black Hole in my opinion is one of these films.  The Black Hole carried me with its concept.  I liked every character(okay, B.O.B got on my nerves sometime)in the movie.  I like Dr. Durant's search for scientific truth and his growing admiration for the superior genius of Dr Reinhardt, I also liked the psychic connection between Kate and V.I.N.CENT. (though unexplained in the film how a human can have a psychic link with a robot...yet it's an interesting concept.)

Anyway if you're looking for an enjoyable movie that may (it probably will) leave you with questions and commentary on acting, plot, dialog, and questionable science...Then this Disney classic is tailor made for you.

Note: John Barry's fantacular score for The Black Hole greatly enhances your listening and viewing pleasure.  I also enjoyed the spiritual/biblical connotations within the film.

Maybe I like robots played by human actors in plastic costumes or those cool looking trash can robots that dominated 70s sci-fi.  Either way you cut it, I like the Black Hole.  But make no mistake about it, The Black Hole is anything but low budget-it's actually groundbreaking in terms of visual effects.  The thing is, The Black Hole plays out like a cheesy 50s sci-fi flick regardless of the budget.  Plus, this film gives us Robert Forster, Anthony Perkins, Ernest Borgnine and Roddy McDowell.  McDowell provides the voice of a cute trash can robot(no corporation would EVER make a robot this silly looking) who's actually quite a little [...] kicker.  Perkins is still slightly in Norman Bates mode as a  traitor scientist.  Borgnine is a whiny schmuck.  Forster does his usual wooden, badazz performance as the hero.  He has a tendency to compliment any crew member who takes out an evil robot with comments like, ""Good shot"" and ""Way to go, Bob"".  Here's my quick rundown:  Forster and crew discover a spaceship missing for 20 years.  It's resting comfortably on the edge of the biggest black hole in the universe.  Once aboard, they meet Maximillian Schell who's a wacky scientist hell bent on taking his ship into the black hole, through and beyond!  He's slaughtered his crew and made them all robots(a process that consists of wrapping the head in tinfoil and electrocuting the person), and is guarded at all times by a creepy looking robot named Maximillian.  Perkins wants to join Schell, but Forster ain't having it, so the battle begins.  Forster'll be damned before he's used as a guinea pig(though he becomes one anyway).  Lots of laser shootouts with the evil robots(complete with trademark laser shooting sound) and running around.  Not quite on the epic level of something like Star Wars or 2001.  I think alot of people hate this coz they compare it to Star Wars and expect alot from Disney.  I think the movie's pretty darn fun to watch myself.

The Black Hole offered another film to mimic characters while playing on the playground, or filled your mind with fantasy.

By that time I was an FX gunkie, actually due mostly to seeing this film, and the movie floored me all over again with some of the most incredible film techniques to hit the big screen ever.

Keep in mind, this movie is a case of some of the most horrid script-writing you will ever see in sci-fi . . . the only cut I can think of that beats it is the Star Wars Holiday Special (yes, the writing is THAT bad).  But if you are a space fan, or like me watch high-tech movies not to be wowed but to see if you can figure out how it is done, this is a MUST OWN for your collection.  Many of the special effects that have become commonplace in filmmaking were done in this film for the very first time, including the development of a new camera that ended up being used in several shots of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, as well as several films after (as a matter of fact, considering The Black Hole and Star Wars were in production at the same time, you will be shocked at how much better the effects are in The Black Hole; I can't help but think what Star Wars would have been if this crew had worked for Lucas instead).  And the U.S.S. Cygnus is quite simply, in my very humble opinion, the single most gorgeous ship ever.

Do NOT pass this one by.  Yes, you will be groaning, but you will also be amazed at what Disney could do before the advent of computer animation.",1093132800,8,1530,4.02970297029703
1015412,2,6305342741,"Seems as if the plot for the movie ""The Black Hole"" got sucked into the title phenomena. One of the most elegant looking science fiction films from the late 70's, ""The Black Hole"" demonstrates that Disney's visual effects department could generate state of the art effects as good if not better than most but they couldn't generated a good script or good acting from the veteran cast.

 Disney generated a string of box office flops during the 70's. ""The Black Hole"" although it earned back its production cost was another disappointment in a long time of disappointments. It seems as if at this time the Mouse couldn't do anything right.

The Palomino crewed by Dr. Durant (Anthony Perkins), Captain Dan Holland (Robert Forster), the pilot Lt. Charles Pizer (Joseph Bottoms), Dr. Kate McCrae (Yvette Mimieux), Harry Booth (Ernest Borgnine) and V.I.N.CENT. (the voice of the late Roddy McDowall) stumble across a missing research vessel the U.S.S. Cygnus at the edge of a massive black hole. When the Palomino is damaged trying to escape the gravitational pull of the black hole, they must dock with the Cygnus unaware that the ship is being commanded by  Dr. Hans Reinhardt (Maximilian Schell). Surrounded by a crew of robots he has designed, Reinhardt's isolation may have driven him mad or, perhaps he was that way all along.

Reinhardt has discovered an anti-gravity device that enables the Cygnus to stay within proximity to the black hole without being sucked inside it. Ultimately, Reinhardt plans on taking a probe into the black hole himself and traveling to wherever it might lead. Unfortunately, Reinhardt also has plans for the crew of the Palomino.

This new re-release has only a nice widescreen anamorphic transfer enhanced for 16x9 TVs. Unlike the Anchor Bay release of a couple of years ago, this edition also has a 16 minute featurette with optical effects wizard Harrison Ellenshaw discussing the making of the film. We get plenty of behind-the-scenes photos and stories about the difficulty and challenges that Disney's effects department faced making the film. Like the Anchor Bay edition the extended 3 1/2 minute trailer is included as well.

The vivid colors and exceptional production design of Peter Ellenshaw are faithfully reproduced. The image looks sharp although analog blemishes exist due to the fact that the film has so many process shots and the age of the negative. It's a pity that the alternate ending or storyboards of it weren't included. Harrison Ellenshaw discusses the alternate ending he dreamed up part of which was shot using Michealangelo's Sistine Chapel as a backing plate for the visuals. Ellenshaw also reveals that the studio was well into production and working without an ending. That's a big surprise. The perplexing ending that was tacked on to this adventure is fascinating but a bit too literal for me.

If you enjoyed the original film, this DVD is a step up with a beautiful, rich looking widescreen transfer. Additionally, we do get a nice retrospective featurette that takes us behind the scenes of the production. Be warned, though, this might not be quite as good as you remember it. Just sit back and enjoy your ride through ""The Black Hole"" and don't ask too many questions.",1092528000,16,3240,4.998144712430427
1015476,3,6305342741,"The Black Hole isn't the best sci fi film ever made.  I don't even know if its in the top ten.  But there is just something about it that I love.  Maybe it's because it's a throw back to the sci fi films of the 50s.  Maybe because the effects are top notch.  Maybe because that space station looks so damn cool!  I'm not sure what it is, but the film is fun.  There are major plot holes, bad dialogue and an ending that really doesn't make much sense.  Let alone the fact that physics really don't mean anything in the world of The Black Hole.  It's funny to think this film came out 4 years after Star Wars and 10 years after Kubrick's 2001.

Disney's release has little differences from the Anchor Bay release of a few years ago.  There is no pan and scan on this version, but it is anamorphic.  The overture is still present, although the a title card replaces the star-scape.  There is also a documentary on the making of the film.

This film is for kids and the kid at heart.  And like I said before, it's just a fun film that very cool to look at.",1091664000,18,1053,4.1182266009852215
1015477,3,6305342741,"How can one rate this movie when it has so many beautifully blended elements with so many gratingly annoying ones?

 Plus sides:

 1. The Cygnus emanates a deep sense of forboding throughout the movie.

 2. The Cygnus' captain, a somewhat Nemo-construct, plays off the elements of being a crazed genius wonderfully.

 3. The musical element to this film is astounding. I can still remember the chills of the musical crescendo as the Cygnus first lights up.

 4. Maximillian makes one hell of a scary, scary robot and it surprised me that Anthony Perkins' death in the movie still allowed a PG rating. Keep in mind, I was 9 years old when I saw this!! Watching somebody get their insides spun around by rotating claws (even if you don't actually see blood or guts) is still pretty raw.

 Minuses:

 1. Ok, for the most part, I liked VINCENT. Even as a youngster, though, I hated BOB. HATED HATED HATED. That ""old prospector"" voice was annoying.

 2. The most hilarious part is when our beloved captain rescues the damsel in distress. The music is triumphant and soaring, but he still manages a rather wimpy ""ow"" as he gets himself barely clunked by an attacking robot.

 3. The whole STARR scene. VINCENT versus STARR. Was there a point to this scene beyond showing off effects? Even as a 9 year old, I was pretty much fast-forwarding through it.

 4. Yikes...we're in outer space, people!! Even when I was 9, I knew that you did not have ANY air in outer space. Still, having a meteor rip through the garden and having our crew moseying around in outer space trying to get on to an escape rocket was hard for me to swallow. It was just plain WRONG.

 5. Heaven/hell scene. Theology aside, why does the crew go to hell and the Cygnus captain goes to (although somewhat half-way; see the movie and you'll catch my drift) heaven? Does this imply that even if you make zombies out of your crew and a robot out of your XO, that you are still redeemed because you ""had a vision?"" Sorry, write me out of that one.

 It is so hard to rate this film as a result. Despite its cons, there are its pros and if there were ever a movie that had something similar to bipolar disorder, this is the one. I still think it's worth checking out.",1091577600,8,2225,4.4504950495049505
1015478,4,6305342741,"OK let's get the bad things about the Black Hole out of the way first of all. Some of the dialogue is unbelievably naff. It has an overtly judgemental morality which runs throughout the film from start to finish. Very occasionally the SFX slip, and you see wires holding up robots etc. Some of the scenes are cloying, particularly involving the antics of the overly cute, heroic robots... Also the makers would have done better to remember what effect the vacuum of Space would have on people NOT wearing spacesuits...

Put all that aside though and you are left with a minor sci fi masterpiece. Atmospherically the film is an outright winner - it is just so gothic, from its sets, robots, and cowled and hooded undead crew. It also boasts one of the very best musical scores by John Barry. Visually it is stunning, Space has seldom looked this good. The blue/black background of space with its dense clusters of stars looks as good as it did on the day that it was released. Unlike Star Wars and its visibly dated mattes, this film has more than withstood the test of time.
The film's visual pinnacle though is the giant space ship Cygnus.
A cross between Brighton Pier and The Eiffel Tower, this gothic behemoth is like no other. The scene where its lights are switched on suddenly and unexpectedly, is one of awe and beauty.
The exploration of the ship, culminating in the arrival in the control tower is stunning. Ditto the firing up of the ship's Frankenstein Lab like reactors and huge engines for its final journey to the Black Hole. Even in its death throes, this huge vessel retains a sad dignity.
Acting honours go to Maximilian Schell as an intergalactic Captain Nemo. Ernest Borgnine, Anthony Perkins, Yvette Mimeux, and Robert Forster all provide very able support though.
The blood red robot Maximilian (I wonder how that name was arrived at...) is an inspired creation, and has a temperament to match its colour scheme...

The dvd is great, picture and sound are both superb. Playing the film in 5.1 Dolby Digital on your home cinema is something else, especially when your memory of the film in the cinema is in mono. All sound channels are free of distortion and nicely separated. Both Surround channels in particular are superb.
Get this dvd if you can (it is due to be re released anyway) and add one of sci fi's most underrated films to your collection.",1087948800,8,2373,4.6746411483253585
1015479,4,6305342741,"This movie is truly one of the forgotten, yet flawed classics of the late 1970's. Nobody seemed to remember this movie except for those of us who truly loved it when we were children. What kid could forget the menacing presence of the robot Maximillian or the creepiness of the mysterious humanoids, not to mention the swirling black hole itself.
The only problem that I have with this movie now that I'm an adult is that it never seems to decide whether or not to be sophisticated adult sci-fi or shoot'em up kiddie-fare. It tends to flip flop back and forth with slightly irritating results.  The movie presents us with very dark themes about life, death and the nature of the universe, but then turns into a robotic western style shoot out complete with a cowboy sounding robot named Old B.O.B.  Religious themes are explored here as well, especially during the conclusion of the film, which add a much needed breath of fresh air.  In the end, the film is a mixture of things that really should not have shared the same story, but we have the massive success of STAR WARS at the time to thank for that.
Science is yet another area in the film that is handled rather flippantly.  While attempts are made at realism down to the smallest detail in some areas, others simply don't hold up well at all.  Most sequences onboard the Palomino are well done, but many on the Cygnus ruin any sense of realism that was being attempted beforehand.  One scene shows the main characters exposed to the outside area of the Cygnus as the spacecraft enters the black hole.  Several minutes later, when a meteor rips the roof off a section of the ship`s agricultural garden, the vacuum of space kicks in and threatens everyone!  Moments later, the characters are again crawling around on the outside of the ship, where the vacuum of space should exist!  Furthermore, the intense gravity seems to affect no one at all, even though they are all directly exposed up close to this awesome force of nature.  Go figure!
The film repeatedly fails in the area of dialogue and plot several times over too.  The reason for this is the simple fact that there were many writers who served up revisions and changes to Jeff Rosenbrook`s original story.  This ultimately led to several convoluted plot devices being introduced through the dialogue that seem to appear out of nowhere, then in turn lead to nothing at all.  A perfect example of this is when Maximillian kills a character and Dr. Reinhardt, the man who controls the evil robot, suddenly asks for protection from it!  The whole scene just came straight out of left field!  There are other moments of babbling dialogue that makes one scratch their head in sheer disbelief, but regardless of these rather hilarious flaws the film still has plenty to offer.
The special-effects and cinematography are what really steal the show here, both having earned the film Oscar nominations. The ghostly Cygnus lingering on the event horizon of a black hole and the Palomino's subsequent exploration are superbly rendered.  The matte paintings of space itself are beautiful, adding lots of blues and greens instead of the same old black that many other films have given us before and since.  The ship designs are beautiful, as are the awesome sets. Also worth noting is the journey into the black hole and the visually impressive renditions of Heaven and Hell, which features some of composer John Barry's most memorable and eerie music.
This long awaited remastered DVD edition is really breath-taking. The picture is so clear and crisp that you can see the wires that the robots are suspended on. I only wish that Disney would learn to release DVDs with more bonus features (audio commentary, interviews, TV spots, etc.). If you are interested in bonus material, I would suggest that you track down the Limited Collector's Edition which features the wide-screen video, 9 movie lobby cards, a 44 page booklet, and a really cool looking tin featuring a scene of the Cygnus spacecraft on the lid. The booklet is packed with all sorts of interesting things such as interviews with director Gary Nelson and matte artist Harrison Ellenshaw, tons of pictures and artwork, the script for the abandoned alternate ending, a reprint of the original Pressbook, and more.  It answers any and all questions that one could have about what went into the making of this movie, from its inception to the final print! This DVD edition only gets three stars due to its failure to include any of these truly informative extras!
All in all, the film is beautiful to look at, even compared to today's visual effects.  The film may sport some flawed writing and lapses in physics, but ultimately it is a fun adventure which does manage to present some interesting possibilities.  One does have to wonder what could have been done with this material in different hands, but I guess that is something we will never know!",1082246400,60,4915,4.787234042553192
1015480,3,6305342741,"1979 was a watershed year for cinema sci fi.  In that 12 months, audiences were treated to ""Alien"", ""Star Trek the Motion Picture"", and Disney's ""The Black Hole"".  The fate of the first two examples are widely known: ""Alien"" became a pop-culture phenomenon, and ""Star Trek"" was a disappointing flop, relying on sequels to resurrect the franchise.
Yet surprisingly, it was ""The Black Hole"" that drilled itself into my consciousness and refused to leave.  The details of the spare plot are well-explained in the Amazon editorial review, so I won't bother re-hashing it.  Instead, I'll attempt to explain just WHY the film has stuck with me for so long.
1) Production design and overall tone:  This is the first Gothic sci-fi movie that I can recall seeing, and it may be the darkest movie ever released under the Disney banner (and it earned Disney's first-ever PG rating).  An evil killer robot?  The mysterious crew?  The fate of Anthony Perkins' character?  This CAN'T be a Disney picture!  Of course, when people refer to the production design of ""The Black Hole"", they are usually talking about one thing, which deserves a whole separate topic below:
2) The USS Cygnus:  Most sci-fi fans have their favorite cinematic spacecraft, and for me the all-time greatest, hands down, is the Cygnus.  While the interior design is more Gothic Cathedral, the exterior is basically Gothic Industrial Revolution.  It resembles an interstellar Eiffel Tower, and in its own way is quite (intentionally?) reminiscent of the Nautilus from Disney's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"".  And yet, it looks like a spaceworthy and plausible design.  Perhaps named in honor of the (then-suspected) black hole in the constellation Cygnus X1, both the ship model and interior sets were designed by Peter Ellenshaw, son of the great Disney effects artisan Harrison Ellenshaw (""Mary Poppins"").
3) Visual Effects:  It really steams me that some have called the VFX in this movie ""cheap""!  By 1979 standards, they were magnificent (and Oscar-nominated), yet thanks to some unconventional methods, they largely hold up today.  Supposedly, the Cygnus model was so finely detailed that it couldn't be shot against a blue screen; so Ellenshaw photographed it live against a starfield painted on glass.  As a result, the space scenes still look good even on a bad video transfer (not the case with bluescreen movies like the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, where the travelling matte is now visible on some versions).
4) Weirdness:  Come on, what the hell is up with that ending?  Fantastic.
Of course, there were also several not-so-great things about this movie, namely some cheesy dialogue, and the disappointing abandonment of physics towards the end.  These aspects prevent it from being a four-star picture, but ""The Black Hole"" is absolutely worth a look from sci-fi and design fans, which were the original target audience anyway.

1015481,3,6305342741,"The crew of the deep-space exploration vehicle ""Palomino"" is returning to earth after a fruitless search for alien civilizations when they stumble across a once lost ship hovering at the edge of a huge black hole in this 1980 flick that Starlog magazine billed as Disney's $25 million gamble.  The gamble did not pay off for reasons that become quickly clear and are reinforced throughout the flick - dated special effects and a thin plot that's an obvious pastiche of ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", ""Frankenstein"" and ""Moby Dick"".
The ship turns out to be the ""Cygnus"" a one of a kind mammoth wonder designed by the equally enigmatic Hans Rheinhardt (Maximillian Schell).  Though a huge ship, Rheinhardt is mysteriously the only surviving member of the crew - never a good sign in sci-fi.  In place of the crew, Rheinhardt appears to have built an army of androids - militant sentries, faceless androids who give the ship the air of a medieval abbey, and Maximillian (no relation) a silent, floating enforcer with whirring blades where his hands should be and a single unblinking eye that seems fixed in an evil stare.  Rheinhardt fetes the Palomino crew (which quickly gets over its apprehensions of the reclusive master of the Cygnus) and invites them to witness his planned entry into the nearby black hole.  Rheinhardt has pioneered a type of gravity engine which he believes will allow him to enter the black hole safely and learn of its mysteries.  As they poke around however, our heroes of the Palomino only find disturbing clues as to what Rheinhardt has been doing all those missing years (the most ominous appears to be an elaborate funeral held by the androids) and even begin to wonder if they will be allowed to escape the Cygnus.
""The Black Hole"" doesn't turn up on cable that often, so it's worth at least a rental.  The effects are so dated, it's pointless to even try comparing them to anything of our CGI age.  Instead, they have their own unique quality which keeps you from dismissing it.  The look of the Cygnus seems very un-spaceship like (wide halls and sweeping spaces, unlike the claustrophobic corridors and cloistered nooks of Nostromo) which makes the flick look even more interesting, but only as an extremely expensive episode of ""Dr. Who"".  The problem with the look is that the film has no frame of reference for the state of technology in the future age in which the story occurs.  How much of the Cygnus and its robot crew is supposed to amaze us?  Are hordes of monkish androids an unsurprising thing to find?  Who knows.  They could have handled that better by making Roddy Macdowell's character V.I.N.CENT an android, which would have given the Palomino (and us) a better frame of reference.  The dialog won't win any awards, but it's not the hokum that others have called it (though with the talent available, the script was bound to fall short).  The flick's biggest hurdle is that it's unclear who its for - too violent and ambiguous (especially at the end) for kids, but not exciting enough for adults or teens (like the lasergun battles - no teen would buy robot-sentries who manage to stand still while humans blast them).  Schell is great as the sinister Rheinhardt (I don't think he's that overplayed) while Tim Bottoms is also great as the Palomino's resident hot-head.  Anthony Perkins seems underplayed as the Palomino crewman who actually buys into Rheinhardt's fantasies, while Ernest Borgnine gets some laughs as the Palomino's journalist who alternates between snooping and cowering (but always thinks of himself).  Though it's easy to see what went wrong, I still like to catch this flick when its on.  When it came to decide between financing either this flick on one hand or 2 more Herby movies, a sequel to ""The Apple Dumpling Gang"" and, another remake of ""Parent Trap"", ""The Black Hole"" was still the better idea.",1064880000,3,3874,4.823262839879154

Personally, I like the whole idea of the scientist Max Schnell, wanting to take the crew into the black hole.
The ending was great. Some people don't get it. Too cereberal for them I suppose. Ok, it isn't 2001. It isn't supposed to be.

This is exactly the type of film that Disney of the 1970s and 80s should not have been making. The Mouse House has no excuse for going through growing pains cinematically.
Quick plot: The great ship Argo is lost. Earth sends a crew of Anglo stereotypes to look for her, only to find the chief scientist has co-opted the ship, turned the crew into soulless zombies, and plans to prove his theories by throwing the great ship into a black hole.
Now I'll admit most kids didn't know too much about physics at the time, but more of us did than you might think. MAybe that's why we thought the movie was stupid. That, or the inane shooting gallery scene or the robot Stormtroopers or Maximillion, the bot with Cuisinarts for arms (although Anthony Hopkins dies real good from them).
In truth, that's what galls me about this film. They had a chance to get deep and dark here (as they have since), and Hopkins demise was an indicator of somebody's willingness to go there. But the rest of the film just felt like - um - a Disney movie, from the cinematography to the costumes. Eeeeesh.

Maxmillian Schell was the perfect pick as the spontaneously crazed Dr. Reinhart. His temper is fueled by people doubting his work, or the unexplained. Too bad that the cool Robert Forester fueled little character into his protective Captain of the PALAMINO. Anthony Perkins, and Ernest Borgine were fair as the doctor and engineer of the crew, as was Yvette Mimieau playing Dr. Kate. Joseph Bottoms was the comic AND young cowboy, making a few good chuckles. All of the driods were great, minus the century troopers, that moved like a bunch of department store manequins.

 The CYGNUS and settings are immensely triumphant and an awe to see. Now, for the hollow part of the log.
  The dialouge and ideas of the tale are all almost sheer dumb.
 A lot of the effects are very modern and slick, even for today (oh, yes they are!) The problem lies in a few too many copied ideas, and humans in space, still breathing? And how could a droid, even with great hydraulic gravity rescue a human from the very imminent gravity of a BLACK HOLE? Also too Disney friendly and should have been more adventurous, tragic, and even a possible thriller-now that is a great thought.

For an adult, well, the plot, physics and acting have a few problems.  The plot had no real problems with it other than connecting the dots better.  Had it been tighter I think many of the other problems would have been less of an issue.  Physics is another big problem, there are a number of scenes towards the end where either the black hole's gravity of vacuum of space should have presented bigger problems when the Cygnus was falling apart.  Lastly the acting was a little flat, but that might be due to the problematic script if rewrites were all to common.
The special effects, even by todays CGI standards, is good.  For 1979 they were great!  It might have been nice to see Disney revamp some of the effects with CGI, like BBC did with Red Dwarf.

It's a shame that Schell, Borgnine, and Perkins have to suffer through such jargon, but they, along with the other cast members, manage to survive. And Roddy McDowall and Slim Pickens provide voices to what may be two of the worst excuses for robots ever put to film.
John Barry's score has its moments of granduer, especially the opening theme, but the battle scenes music is almost laughable as a try at the John Williams's ""Star Wars"" arena.  Barry has done much better.
The ending is highly unsatisfactory, confusingly blending the scientific and the religious.  Like others have said, this strange attempt at trekking into ""2001"" territory fails.

Of course, if movies were a few hours longer this could have been super developed, but for what it's worth, this movie is right on target.

1015588,2,6305342741,"When I picked up The Black Hole recently, I was very excited. I remembered enjoying this movie very much when it first came out. After watching this movie now with my 11 year old son, I couldn't help but scratch my head and wonder what exactly I liked about it. The special effects, for its time, are very good. The bad robot was creepy and the story, overall, was interesting if not overly predictable.
What bothers me about this movie is the complete lack of originality, except for the last few minutes. Cute little robots, one with a cowboy accent (built in Texas of course), large android-like soldiers (bad of course), all steal (not borrow) from Star Wars. Disney had such a chance to make a unique film, especially with the money they spent, and instead made an overtly derivative film with uninteresting and equally derivative characters.
There are some redeeming qualities - the concept behind the crew of the derelict ship, with their mirrored faces, and who they really are, the fine acting by Schell, but even his role was every old-scientist-gone-mad-on-deserted-planet character from 50's B-movies. The ending (last 5 minutes ONLY) was clever, but HOW they ended up there was just more unbelievable plot turns.
In general I love movies, and give them leniency when I can, but I can't with this one.  As far as my 11-year old, in his words ""It was OK, I guess."" Pretty damning something that lackluster from someone his age.",1047686400,,1438,4.798387096774194
1015589,4,6305342741,"I got the DVD a few days ago and watched it once and then a couple days later half way through again from middle to end. I like the whole concept of the movie quite a bit. The story has some good twists and turns which keeps it interesting.
I found the visuals quite good and the sinister and distant mood quite appropriate. The Cygnus is a wonderfully detailed ship and shows nicely in many scenes before and after starting to enter the black hole. The black hole and the space visuals are generally nicely done too. Since I saw this as a kid, the robots Maximillian and V.I.N.cent (and B.O.B as an interesting contrast and variation) really stuck in my mind as very unique in the sci-fi area. Some people apparently complain that they are take-offs of Star Wars robots but that comparison eludes me.
I thought the acting of Max Schell was quite good and the accent was a great characteristic for that role.
The whole section where Dr. Hans Reinhart and Maximillian meet up and apparently merge into one human/robot entity was a favorite section of the movie (although just a bit funny when the human eyes appear moving about in Max's head). The hell-like landscape with Maximillian standing on the mountain with flames rising around him was a wonderful bizarre dreamscape.
I did think some of the music during laser fight scenes was a bit odd. I would have preferred different music in those places. The music in other times (including during the Maximillian/hell scene was good though.
I wasn't as fond of the ending after the hell/maximllian scene when it just seemed to end on a happy ""we made it through"" note with the probe ship heading away. I think I would have preferred them entering a totally bizarre universe which was visually unlike ours. That would have ending on a less sure and more interesting note (IMHO).
Anyway, it's a classic I'll watch again for sure.",1038096000,,1875,4.650602409638554

It has its moments-some of them wonderful-including some great effects for the time (and for Disney). The dialog is a bit of a clunker, some of the jokes are terrible, but I've heard MUCH worse. I always enjoy Max Schell-a great actor. The rest of the crew is (literally) expendable. I'll never be able to believe Anthony Hopkins going into space. That's too much of a stretch for me! However, the sets for the film are fairly convincing and certainly fun. This film is meant to be a grand adventure. I think some detractors need to loosen their belts a bit and just...r-e-l-a-x. The DVD transfer is quite good and clean. The sound is nothing to brag about. Neither are the extras for that matter. But so what.

1015591,3,6305342741,"After the success of Star Wars and Star Trek: The Motion Picture, many studios were clamoring for movies that dealt with this re-energized genre of space operas.  With many live action classic romps under its belt including 20,000 Under The Sea, who better than Disney to bring a great tale to a family audience.
Enter 'The Black Hole', Disney's 1979 entrance to Sci-Fi. I remember watching this as a boy when it hit the theatre and was excited to get the DVD, mostly for nostalgia reasons, and re-living what I consider a great 'story'.  But after watching this DVD I had mixed emotions.
On the pro side, I was thrilled to take part in viewing this once again, and was reminded why The Black Hole stuck with me all these years, even after other more popular and big-budgeted action space action thrillers came and went (ex: Krull, Battle Beyond the Stars)...it was the story.  Sure there was some flat dialogue, and some plot struggles, but overall it was a pure space fantasy movie.  A small group of explorers and their sidekick robot, Vincent (Disney's hybrid version of R2-D2 and C-3PO), are on an exploratory mission of uncharted space when they discover a black hole.  Upon investigation they discover the USS Cygnus, a very large space carrier thought to have been lost many years ago along with its crew.  Our explorers soon discover that the Cygnus is still inhabited after all these years, by a lone surviving scientist and his very imposing robot, Maximillian (painted devil red).  Other robots and faceless androids are on board, and soon our explorers uncover a more sinister plot.  Our lone scientist has gone slightly mad, will not let our explorers leave the ship, the crew never abandoned ship as first explained, and now our scientist wants to take the Cygnus through the black hole to the other side, perhaps to become a god himself.
Throughout the story, we are given clues to what is really happening, and the surprise revelations towards the climax are reminiscent of what Rod Serling may have wrote.  All in all a good family adventure, without too much violence (it is implied however,...this is Disney), no swearing, nice large sets and a good diversity of characters.
The cons: Even after the success of Star Wars and Star Trek, it seems Disney rushed this movie to completion with little money spent on special effects.  Though the movie was made in '79, it looks as if it was made way before Star Wars or Trek just on the camp value alone.  At times it reminded me of the 60's TV series Lost in Space, or the original Disney 20,000 Leagues.  Also, it is quite apparent that the lasers are pure animation as are their affects, some of the sets though large look cheap, lighting and fog machines are used in situations that are kinda atrocious, and probably my biggest complaint: you can SEE all the wires holding the robots in just about every scene.  That in itself is unforgivable given the fact other movies at that time and movie making techniques were advanced enough to hide them.
I do not believe the transfer was re-mastered.  Throughout the movie there is noticeable frame flecks and graininess at times.  The sound does not appear to be enhanced either so I'd say the over all quality is no better than the original VHS release.  There are also virtually no extras: 1 theatrical trailer and a very boring picture gallery.  All this gallery contains is scanned production shots and numerous variations of release posters.  Nothing too much to really wow the viewer.  Considering this is sorta a cult classic film some interviews or production notes are a no-brainer, but sadly not included.
Hate to sound too negative here, but it is a must for your collection if you enjoy good science fiction stories and can safely share this with you family.",1029110400,83,3782,4.755351681957187

Technically it is a fantastic film. Peter Ellenshaw's graphics, illustrations and designs are wonderful. The ships are very detailed and the costumes - fit, but clever.
The characters that stand out are Ernest Borgnine's troublesome personality as well as Yvette Mimoux. My favorite is by far, was the vocalizations of Roddy McDowell as V.I.N.CENT (Vital Information Necessary Centralized).
The main bridge set was incredible and the robot Maximillian was very scary. The story is simple and not very detailed, but the movie overall was fun. The music is the best. A great score by John Barry. I loved the soundtrack.

1015716,4,6305342741,"...that V.I.N.C.E.N.T. (who, as most people here have noted, is about the cutest robot since that little bugger from STAR WARS) looks a LOT like Eric Cartman of South Park fame?  Wonder if Matt Stone and Trey Parker planned that...?
In any case, I like this movie.  I just finished watching it and I have to say that though it scared the bejeezus out of me as a child (and is probably the flashpoint of my panic disorder..).  I mean, really!  It was a children's movie that had corpses spring up from the bottom of the screen, glimpses of Heaven and Hell, and the isolation of being flung to the far side of the universe (presumably) away from everything one has ever known.  That's a lot foe a kid to take in..  especially from a Disney movie.  After this ""Altered Staes"" seemed tame.
I view The Black Hole as a sort of homage (pronounced ""OHM-ahzh"" in the snooty French way) to classic Space Operas such as 2001 (which as great as it is, it's also one of the most elongated, boring movies ever made), Space: 1999, and Forbidden Planet.  The Black Hole draws from the dated costuming, awkward (yet, at the time, trendy) ""space"" vocabulary, archetypal characterization (which does encompass wooden acting and somewhat trance-like line delivery) high-tech weaponry and robots-as-sentient-personalities that made the Space Operas a lasting American Institution.  Yay.
I don't understand the ending at all..  I'm not sure anyone does,  but it certainly plays along with the rest of the movie - philosophical quotes (don't you LOVE V.I.N.C.E.N.T.??  He's like the best part of the movie!), footnotes, scientific (and somewhat fantastical) theories and dropped plots (just what was that ""Protect me from Maximillian"" line all about?).  Yum!
All-in-all, The Black Hole is classic sci-fi stuff - confused, bizzare, lacking plot goals all considered - I will watch it again and again.",1018224000,,1876,4.936305732484076

This movie was a flop at the box office and most critics weren't so gentle with it.  But I really enjoyed this campy sci-fi flick from the Walt Disney Studios for many reasons:
1. I was overwhelmed by the teaser trailer (too bad it's not included on this DVD) where the green grid is moving all over the screen, ending with the Black Hole logo swifting and twisting in black.  Awesome!!
2. The black and yellow logo in some of the posters, the one shown on the DVD case.
3. The U.S.S. Cygnus.  WOW!!! What a beautiful ship.
4. The robots.  Maximillian truly looks menacing.  And V.I.N.CENT and Old B.O.B.; the cutest robots since ""Star Wars""'s R2-D2.
5. The cast of outstanding performers: Maximilian Schell, Anthony Perkins, Robert Forster, Joseph Bottoms, Yvette Mimieux, Ernest Borgnine, and Roddy McDowell as the voice of V.I.N.CENT.
6. John Barry's majestic score.
7. The final scene, inside the black hole.  Those images.  Those visual effects.  John Barry's music.

There is a lot of good special effects work, and some very impressive sets. The sombre tone is very effective, and Professor Rheinhart comes across very well. However, in my view the stilted dialogue and wooden performances by the other actors (and robots) come close to spoiling it. I tend to watch it with an ear closed to most of the talking.

Though I found the atmospheric style and special effects appealing, I had to give a negative counterpoint to all the glowing reviews I see here.  And please don't say ""it's just a movie"" - there's no excuse for grossly poorly thought out stories; suspension of disbelief can't work when premises are patently stupid.  Reasons to laugh at this movie:
- What are chemical rocket based ships more suited to flying to the moon doing searching deep space?  It would literally take them 1000's of years to get to even the nearest star. (they should've used some sort of warp/hyperdrive premise)
- OK what's with the heaven/hell stuff?  Did the ending make any sense to anyone?  Were the script writers on acid the whole time?
- Why was the scientist suddenly INSIDE Maximillian at the end?
- Why was Maximillian triumphantly standing over some kind of hellish domain at the end?
- What's with robots with tempers and egos... OK so maybe artificial intelligence is really really advanced in the future... but would a robot really have such a bad tantrum that it would blow it's own circuits and die (the STAR sharp shooter)?
- Why would robots need to practice target shooting?  Once they perfect their skills, they shouldn't degrade any more than our 20th century car-building robots would.
- Why was everyone so impressed with the Cygnus' ""gravity"" system?  Humans on Earth had obviously already conquered gravity theory since the little robots had ""anti-gravity"" floating abilities.
- Why was there a scene that implied that Maximillian was the real boss on the ship; they never expanded on that hint.
- Why was Maximillian ever given chopping blades?  What purpose would that have served on a ship full of soulless, mindless automatons that never disobey.  And even if some kind of weapon was needed, why not simply give him laser-cannon hands?  The guard robots don't have chopping blades, they all have guns.
- Why didn't Maximillian have real hands?  The guard robots did.  It would seem a more useful design.
- How could BOB ""permanently charge"" the other little robot's lasers?  If ""permanant charge"" technology exists, why isn't he already permanently charged straight out of the factory where he was built?
- For advanced deep space ships, don't they even have simple RADAR to detect things, like, oh, say KILLER METEOR SHOWERS before they hit?
- Why were the hallways and rooms so cavernous on the Cygnus?  None of the space seemed to serve a purpose. On a real future Earth, the Cygnus designers would be fired for budget overruns.  It would be a waste of space and would never be designed thus.  The Palomino was a realistic ship design; the Cygnus was laughable, though beautifully rendered cinematically.",1004659200,3,2939,4.846

I still can't decide if that was used to make him more likable or so when he finally dies the viewer is supposed to feel a sense of relief.

1015808,4,6305342741,"Oh, the Black Hole...what can I say about this film. I have real love/hate relationship with the film. I first saw it in '79, at age 15, and at the time it both thrilled and embarassed me. Kudos goes to Elleshaw and his production design. The U.S.S. CYGNUS is probably the most beautiful (if not exotic and impropable) space craft design ever put on film. The acting in the film was a strange cross between wooden (Robert Forster) to well overblown (Max Schell), the rest of the cast seems to fall somewhere in the middle. Ironically, the robot most reviewers disliked the most, VINC.E.N.T.(Roddy McDowell), steals the show in my opinion. The writers gave him the best lines in the picture. It is unfortunate that the filmmakers and Disney chose to do a Star Wars retread, instead of really putting out a great and unique story. Too bad. What saves The Black Hole from becoming one of those films that you soon forget existed after you've seen it once is the score. John Barry is the single most reason I have fond memories of watching this film. He gives this ""little"" popcorn picture such a sweeping grand score that sometimes I feel he meant it for a bigger, better motion picture.  I still love this film in many ways, it can be very funny and well thought out in small areas of the story. It fails terribly in science though. The dipiction of the black hole is inaccurate (at least to current theories), that ""drain"" hole look to it would only take place if the hole was syphoning material from a nearby star, it would form a ring around the black hole called an Accretion disk. Another flop in the science within the film is a scene near the end, when a crushed Cygnus is falling towards the black hole, the Palomino's surviving crewmembers actually crawl along the outside of the ship--WITHOUT WEARING PROTECTIVE SPACE GEAR!! I think that scene may have came from a weird theory that I recall reading about black hole's that may contain some sort of atmosphere around them or something to that effect. Still, despite the convoluted screenplay, dull acting and bizarre ending (was that Earth our heroes were heading to after emerging back to normal space or another unexplored planet?), the movie will alway possess a warm, comfortable spot in my heart and memories.",992563200,,2272,4.68
1015809,4,6305342741,"A caveat before I begin.  The Black Hole came out when I was four years old.  For the next few years, I had Black Hole wallpaper in my bedroom.  Until it got too beat up for use, I had a Black Hole lunchbox and sitting in my old desk in my parent's house are my Vincent and Maxmillian toys that somehow have survived from 1979.
So, suffice to say, ""The Black Hole"" was a big part of my childhood.  Having seen the film a number of times, and purchasing it on vhs upon rerelease a couple of years ago, I came to the revelation that it was (at best) an average sci-fi film.  The four-star rating derives from gratitude more than anything else.  Some aspects of the film do stand out.
One of the notable achievements of the film is John Barry's score, which in one-third brooding, one-third hyperkinetic, and one-third heroic march.  In a way, the great variance in Barry's scoring highlights the fundamental flaw of ""The Black Hole"".  To use a cliche, the plot is painted with wide strokes and alternates between a number of science fiction film norms, never staying for too long in any one type of groove.  At moments, the film plays like a vintage '50's morality tale a la ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" or ""Forbidden Planet"".  Just as quickly, the film becomes a ""Star Wars"" redux with the heroes in white facing off against faceless villains.  Finally, in small portions through and dominating at the end, there are streaks of existentialist pretention that would have made Kubrick blush (or at least feel flattered).
In short, the film itself never amounts to anything too deep because it never develops one theme or plays on one tone for too long for anything to come of it.  However, the film still gets a four-star rating.  Partially on nostalga, yes, but like so many films that transcend their plot loopholes and work, ""The Black Hole"" has a number of positives going for it.
As is often the case with many cult films or popcorn movies, ""The Black Hole"" has a distinguished cast of actors who lend the film more weight than it ought to have.  The special effects also give ""The Black Hole"" an intensity that carrys the audience through the film.  In fact, even by todays standards, the set design and FX execution hold up remarkably well.  Whereas the thematic tone of the film never seems to ring true or consistently, the mood of the film is carried and maintained by the sets and special effects.  In short, the film is an enjoyable romp on the sum of its parts if not its whole.
Ultimately, though, I imagine this film will fall into the same hole as other films (to use Disney as an example) such as ""Pete's Dragon"" or ""Old Yeller"" that will remain special to those who saw it in their youth, but be lost to newer generations of film watchers with countless more current popcorn genre flicks to choose from.  Alas.
Still, for any fan of science fiction and any fan of a good popcorn film, don't be afraid to get sucked into ""The Black Hole"".

This was fun to watch again; I loved it when it came out in 1979, but I doubt I would like it now without seeing it in my childhood...
The ending was ambigious, but cool, IMHO.  When Dr. Reinhardt goes to hell and he ""merges"" with Max, he's being encased in a robotic form similar to what he did with the original crew (the humaniod robots).  This seems to imply a view of a God which punishes the wicked after death in a way suitable to the person's trangressions during their physical life.  Notice the Doctor didn't merely perish in a fiery hell; he was punished in a manner similar to the way he murdered the crew.  At least that's what the movie seemed to be saying to me.
BTW, my dvd didn't come with the widescreen format, even though the keep-case indicates it has the widescreen and the full screen formats...",989884800,,1250,4.524444444444445

Granted, the film has GREAT SFX... but GREAT SFX does not make a GREAT film.  And it pays MORE than homage to Star Wars. V.I.N.CENT is tin can shaped like R2 and as effeminite as C-3PO. For goodness sakes, the sentry robots have Darth Vader's FACE! A saving grace is the evil robot Maximillian. What a dark, ominous menace it was.  What kills this film when you get down to it is the writing. I have a whole list, but I'll focus on one point as an example....For the entire film, Dr. Reinhardt is a mad genius... but then for seemingly NO reason, towards the end, he tells Kate McCrae ""Save me from Maximillian."" Where did that come from? It's like the story just made a sharp left into an oak tree. You can't start a new story thread at the end of a film. I didn't even mind the ""Fantasia"" ending, Dr. Reinhardt and Maximillian togther in a ""Dante-esque"" hell. But in the end, you are left with a story that had too many things going on at once, rather than it being one thing or another and a movie that isn't really sure of exactly what it wants to be.",989107200,,1206,4.189655172413793
1015812,4,6305342741,"Plot comparisons to 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea are inevitable, but here Disney also returns to disturbing themes it visited in its earliest, unapologetically terrifying animated features: here, as in Pinocchio, people are horrifically transformed and enslaved; here, as in Bambi, innocents are violently murdered; here, as in Fantasia's ""Night On Bald Mountain"" sequence, there is an unsettling vision of Hell.
But just as the earlier films offset their frightening moments with considerable charm and wit, The Black Hole counters its macabre elements with a kind of goofiness, especially in the stilted dialog.  Nevertheless, there are philosophical questions to ponder here, questions about technology, genius, megalomania, and what the writers meant by lines like, ""Some cause must have created all this, but what caused that cause?""
As with Star Wars, the most engaging performances are turned in by robots, though trouper Maximilian Schell does have some juicy turns as the lecherous mad scientist.  The score is gripping, and other than a few wires that reveal themselves, the special effects are almost improbably stylish.  Indeed, the sight of Ernest Borgnine jogging in a unitard is a special effect unto itself.",985996800,,1223,5.4603174603174605
1015813,5,6305342741,"A fantastical reimagining of ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", in Disney's ""The Black Hole"" we instead find our film's heroes out in space, taking refuge aboard the U.S.S. Cygnus, a ship believed to have been lost until now. The Cygnus now sits at the edge of an ominous and mysterious black hole, crewed by robots and mysterious hooded figures, and captained by the mad Doctor Hans Reinhardt, who is determined to travel into the mouth of the black hole and beyond.

Disney's 1979 sci-fi classic, ""The Black Hole"", is often falsely remembered as a box office flop, and it gets a lot of flack for its dialogue, two cartoony ""good guy"" robots (voiced by Roddy McDowall and Slim Pickens), and it's reportedly conceived at the last-minute finale. All the praise for this one tends to go to its stunning visuals and amazing score. And, I'll grant that the score by John Barry and the beautiful visuals throughout the film are amazing, downright glorious. This movie is candy for the eyes and ears, no doubt. To me, it's ""Space Mountain: The Movie"". And, despite being a huge fan and a huge Disney fan in general, I don't claim this movie is perfect. I don't really understand why some people have a problem with ""cute"" characters like the robots V.I.N.C.E.N.T. and Old B.O.B., or the Ewoks from Star Wars, etc..., as if there are no ""cute"" things in the real world or something. Frankly, I think if they weren't in the film it would be a huge loss. They are an identifying factor for the film and add the much needed lighthearted moments, and they have even more personality than the human stars, as great as they are. It's a heck of a cast, too, with Maximilian Schell as the mad Doctor, Robert Forster as the leader of the good guys, and his crew, Anthony Perkins, Yvette Mimieux, Tom McLoughlin, and Ernest Borgnine. And frankly, I think the finale, last minute or not, is what truly makes this film so great! It may not be as awe inspiring to some as the ""interpret it yourself"" ending of 2001, but in all honesty, that's not good storytelling. It can make for a good movie, but it's not a true ending to a story. While I can appreciate something like the more ""artsy"" ending of 2001, I appreciate getting a full story, complete with clear and literal ending, a bit more. Now, some people, even those who worked on Black Whole, try to act like it has an ""interpret it yourself"" ending as well, but that's a little hard to swallow. I don't want to blow it for folks who haven't seen it here, but it's very understandable and clear, and I think it's a brilliant idea that was beautifully and eerily executed. So, basically, to me, this movie is a pure delight. A total pleasure and not a guilty one, and vastly underrated.

As for the Disney DVD release itself, it's a nice upgrade from the Anchor Bay edition I used to own. It has enhanced widescreen, a featurette that is essentially an interview with Harrison Ellenshaw, Matte Effects Supervisor on the film and son of Disney Legend Peter Ellenshaw, the man who was really behind the overall look of the film, and also an extended theatrical trailer. It's a fine release for fans of this truly entertaining and awe inspiring moment in Disney history.",985824000,,3199,4.590909090909091

1015939,4,6305342741,"People say that interesting characters and a strong plot are the only things that truly matter in a movie.  This is not true, especially in science fiction.  How many people love the film ALIEN?  I do; it's one of my all-time favorites.  Now how many of us can say that the characters in that film were actually interesting?  Of course they weren't...they were mundane.  Yes, the acting was superb, but The Black Hole's acting isn't too bad, either.  Schell and Forster are great, and Borgnine is fun to watch.  The characters may be cardboard and the plot may be thin, but atmosphere holds the entire film together.  The sets and matte paintings aren't just good- they're fantastic.  Space has never looked so beautiful or mysterious.  The Cygnus is hands-down the coolest ship ever on film (the Nostromo comes in second).  It's bright on the outside, and dark and gloomy on the inside; you really have to see it for yourself.  Both the Sentry robots and the humanoids go well with the ship; the cloaked humanoids were especially creepy, and the scenes that revolved around them were handled expertly.  I especially loved the scene where the captain explored the crew's chambers- John Barry's score fit in perfectly. And that Max is one heck of an awesome creation.  The final twenty minutes are both entertaining and full of suspense.  Perkins' death, the rolling meteor, and the moody journey through heaven and hell are very memorable.  So- is the dialogue dumb?  Yes. Are the cute robots out of place?  Yes.  Is the plot thin and predictable?  Yes.  But this movie is  so full of atmosphere, great music, weird visions, and incredible visuals that all that is forgotten.

1015940,5,6305342741,"Granted that the phenomenal success of Star Wars made major movie studios realize that science fiction movies were successful and bankable, if not profitable. The same could be said about the success of such film like Logan's Run-The Movie, Close Encounters Of the Third Kind, ALIEN, and Blade Runner. The studios in question immediately jumped on the sci-fi bandwagon. and managfed to come out with movies that were successful in some areas and not so successful in others. Basically movies with shlockey plots, cardboard characters, etc. However, some movies that were not so successful at first ended up becoming successful in the end. Despite its delay in entering the mainstream, Disney's first PG rated movie and space opera is a fine example of such a success story.
Despite its overtones of Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and the 1956 classic Forbidden Planet, as well as its darker themes, The Black Hole is a very enjoyable and entertaining family film that has an outstanding cast. Academy-Award nominee Robert Forster, Joseph Bottoms, Yvette Mimiuex, Oscar winners Ernest Borgnine and Maximillian Schell, and the late Anthony Perkins, British actor Roddy McDowall, and Slim Pickens. The special effects are superb, the sets, and costumes are extraordinary, the soundtrack is haunting and memorable. It's ending is mindblowing and cerebral, if not religous in a way. And its plot is as solid as a rock. Definately worth viewing for those interested in Disney films and the science fiction genre. It may have been influenced by Star Wars, but it is still worth watching.

You must know that the DVD version has many things that suck.

I am someone who highly appreciates the older style pre-digital  era of models and wires, and the sheer craftsmanship of the special effects  and miniature work is awesome indeed, rivalling 2001 for it's splendour,  plus it's nice to know that it was all crafted by human hands rather than  just churned out on a cumputer keyboard like so much is today.
True, the  live action and acting could use some work and there are more scientific  and physical inconsistencies and flaws (done for dramatic license no doubt)  than there should be, but still, it's a lot better than some of the junk  that's put out now! (the incredibly horrible ""Starship Troopers""  comes shudderingly to mind!!)
The nostalgia factor for those of us who  grew up in the 7eventies is powerful, but for those of you who have not  seen the film ever before, you need to remember WHEN the film was made and  try to enjoy it for the art that it is rather than try to make something  truly meaningful out of it. (I sometimes wonder if the reviewers who  trashed the movie as they did ever enjoyed entertainment for it's own  sake!) But if you like seventies sci-fi and can enjoy a film that is  designed solely to entertain, you'll love ""The Black Hole"". It is  definitely a unique piece of work.",926553600,,1489,4.596958174904943
1016106,4,6305342741,"If you were fortunate enough to be an impressionable kid when this movie was released, this is probably one of your favorites; it certainly is one of mine.  Today's younger generation--spoiled by the modern special effects  of the '90's--probably won't appreciate what was accomplished in this film  in 1979. What was accomplished is a visually stunning film whose only  drawback is an average script with a few cheesy/corny lines built in.  But  the story line is still intriguing and inspires thought, the musical score  is absolutely fantastic, and the special effects, though 20 years old, are  still better than some of the overhyped effects of more modern movies.  The  hologram and opening shots of The Black Hole in the beginning are neat; and  the suspense/tension of the first 15 minutes and last 15 minutes are the  highlights of the film.  (Isn't the Cygnus a creepy sight to behold  darkened and drifting in space?  How would you like Maximillian chasing you  around a fragmenting ship with those metallic pincers spinning?)  What's in  the middle isn't too bad either.  (Remember this is a kid's flick, that's  why we have BOB and VINCENT)  With the proper perspective and atmosphere,  this can be a very enjoyable film--surround sound and a big screen TV are a  must, along with nighttime viewing in a dark room.  So buy or rent this  cult classic, and go in, through, and beyond!  And please Disney, how about  releasing the soundtrack on CD?",925344000,,1458,4.893004115226337
1016107,4,6305342741,"Unlike many people---I never saw the movie until the VCR revolution was in full gear---still I  enjoyed it---almost as much as I enjoyed the tape I have now. My only gripe would is that the digital transfer is a little too  clear(you can  actually see the wires that the puppeteers are using on the  robot characters at one point).
While the story is probably not the best  one I've ever seen--it's servicable at least.
Oh, yes---the FX were even  more inpressive in this new version.",925257600,,484,4.635294117647059
1016182,4,6305342741,"Okay, so the acting is a little cheesy but the visuals are stunning and MY GOD does Disney need to release this soundtrack!  The music is awesome.",924048000,,146,4.407407407407407
1016183,3,6305342741,"Not to say I hate it either, but I've seen better sci-fi.  I first saw this when I was eight years old, and even then, nineteen years ago, it didn't make much sense.  Besides, since when are black holes BLUE!?  Science is completely ignored, and the ending doesn't make much sense.  Exactly where are the crew of the Palomino headed off to at the end of the  film? Even though this black hole is blue, why does it suddenly turn red  when the Cygnus is right near it? Great visual effects though, but movies  such as ""War of the Worlds"" are a much better find.",923616000,,559,4.266666666666667
1016184,4,6305342741,"This is one of the best science fiction movies ever. Too bad somebody got hold of the script and wrote in two cheesy robots, VINCENT and BOB. They are like floating tin cans with the generic over-sized ""Disney  Eyes"" their animation people love to put on their characters. Well,  the decision backfired. But the rest of the movie comes through, however.  Just go to the kitchen and get a beer whenever the robots get the  limelight.",923443200,,432,4.644736842105263
1016185,4,6305342741,"The first thing you're gonna notice about this re-release is the lack of any Disney markings, with the exception of one: the tiny little print in the bottom-left hand corner of the box that reads, ""Disney  Enterprises"". Disney...""ENTERPRISES""??? Boy, no bragging  about this tape, huh?
Michael, it wasn't that bad. Trust me. Was the  film that bad? I mean, after all, you can see where ""Event  Horizon"" got its inspiration...:)
I really can't see why they took  their name off the tape and left the copyright on there. I mean, if you  look at it, what have the Disney animated films become? The Beast gets  stabbed in ""Beauty and the Beast"". ""Aladdin"" was about  a street-thief who had to ""steal to eat"". And the Lion King had  two lions hitting each other in the face with flames surrounding them,  while echoes of Mufasa's death played. Then you had ""The Hunchback of  Notre Dame"" in which one character kills a baby's parents and later  sings of ""Hellfire"" and pictures himself lusting after Esmerelda.  Finally, we see ""Mulan"", where the title character dresses up as  a guy, risking treason, where the penalty is death, and fights off an  entire army. Along the way, Disney took hits for being both sexist and  racist, capitalizing on and exploiting ethnic cultures that weren't theirs  to touch. And their name appears, covering ""The Black Cauldron""?  Disney's ONLY PG-rated cartoon. The PG-rating came forth because of the  dark violence and the villian who looked like Satan's worst  nightmare.
And then you have ""The Black Hole"", one of two  seemingly forgettable Disney sci-fi's. ""Tron"" was the other one.
This film does have quite a cast to back up its reputation. Academy  Award-winner Ernest Borgnine, Academy Award-nominee Robert Forster, Max  Schell, Anthony Perkins, and the always lovable Roddy McDowall as the voice  of ""Vincent"", the good-guy crew's robot. Yes, their performances  vary, and yes, the dialogue is hammy, but you know what, the dialogue is  there when needed. That's all that counts. I can find about fifty films  last year that can't make that cut(let's start with Something About  Mary...). Leave the rest up to special effects(Rhineheart's ship is a wow!)  and great poetic moments(check out ""hell"" and ""Heaven"")  and you get a nicely-rounded fun ride through a nightmare and back again.  Picture Event Horizon
Yes, this one DOES show ""hell"" at the  end. And for it's time, it IS a very scary depiction. But, it also DOES  show ""Heaven"". The point of these visions was not to be  controversial, but rather, to give a message that we don't know about the  things that lurk on the other sides of the universe.
And perhaps, we  shouldn't pry.
Check out this small wonder that Disney has chosen to  dismiss and see for yourself. Along with TRON, WATCHERS IN THE WOODS, and  THE DEVIL AND MAX DEVLIN, this one is worthy of a place in the  ""Saturday Afternoon Matinee Hall-of-Fame"".

1016186,5,6305342741,"This DVD is AWESOME!!!  I remember seeing this movie as a teenager and it had a tremendous impact on me.  As an adult, I am a little more critical.  As far as movies go, this may not be the best movie in the world but it  definitely has a place in science fiction history.  From a technical  standpoint, Anchor Bay Entertainment (who the film is licensed through) did  a fantastic job digitally remastering this.  I have grown accustomed to my  pan-n-scan, looks like it was filmed through frosted glass copy of the film  on VHS that came out in the eighties.  From the first second of the first  scene my jaw was literally hanging open with amazement.  ""This looks  SO GOOD!!!""  For one thing, being able to see it in the widescreen  format as I did in the theater was a real treat, but the clarity and  vividness of the colors is enough to make you want to buy a DVD player just  to watch this film.  The film was also remastered from Dolby Stereo to  Dolby Digital 5.1 surround.  If you have the equipment, this is a great  showcase film for demonstrating DD5.1.  I highly recommend any fan, even  the casual viewer, to buy this DVD.  You will not be disappointed.",922924800,,1167,4.3915094339622645
1016187,4,6305342741,"In the 70s, Disney made wonderfully adult movies such as this and ""The Watcher in the Woods"", with violence, suspense, and many other things not suitable for young children.  Then, suddenly, they  stopped, instead cranking out the same animated musical with different  titles.  Let's hope they go back to making movies like this.  I mean, what  other Disney movie features people BURNING IN HELL?!  Now, THAT's not your  usual Disney!",922924800,,434,5.1

I know ""Star Wars"" had robots, but it wasn't  campy!  ""The Black Hole"" has 2 (count it 2) robots that look like  kids' play toys instead of robots.  Well on the other hand I suggest that  you buy/rent this movie!",922838400,,369,3.8266666666666667
