6255433,4,B00IA337AY,"7 Assassins was a good film overall.

In the story, a group of government guards set out to recover a stash of stolen gold. The plot thickens however, when they discover a rebel leader is behind the theft and is attempting to use the gold to aid in efforts against their regime. A bandit leader is charged with the task of tracking him down. She has some success, but eventually he escapes to Gold Valley, where several warriors and persecuted civilians have already fled.  The Bandits follow him there, but soon discover that capturing him will be a job easier said than done. Since the village is made up of several seasoned fighters, the bandits are unsuccessful at recovering him. The failure leads to the General in charge of the territory taking over. The battles become more intense. A couple of power struggles take place where the rebels and the government fight over the rebel leader, the gold, and in some cases, revenge is the motivation.

7 Assassins was mostly a good viewing experience for me. It takes place in the early 1900s, so guns are in play. But it's also in a time period, where many fighters still have great skill with blades. So just because you bring a sword to a gun fight, doesn't mean you'll lose. The major skirmishes were good. There was a little wire work used, mostly when a fighter was hit. Sometimes he would fly back further than normal, due to the wires. That didn't bother me though. The individual battles were exciting and if you've been watching Chinese action films for awhile, you'll definitely see some faces from the past make an appearance in this film.

While the fights were generally good, there were a couple of spots where the film slowed down. It was mostly due to character development, so I don't fault the film for that. There were also a couple of lengthy speeches given by the Gold Valley leader, that might have more impact on Chinese audience. Taking into account that this film was primarily made for a Chinese audience in the first place, that's understandable. It helps get them pumped up to see some of their well known actors building into the battle scenes. Also, when the battles occur,  some of them fall in the skirmishes.

Another issue is the title of the film. It's labeled 7 Assassins, but this film's not about a person being assassinated. It's mostly about a  power struggle between government officials and a rebel band. So don't expect to see a Magnificent 7 style  film, with a Chinese flare.

One last area in the film I liked was how the bandit leader turned out to be a wildcard. There was definitely a defined line between the rebels and the government troops. But her group throws a little more spice into the conflict. They have self-interest in mind which almost causes a Spaghetti Western Standoff between the three groups.  She appeared in the film mostly during the beginning and the end. But her group, definitely added to the story, in a good way.

7 Assassins is offered In Mandarin with English or Spanish subtitles. An English dub is also available.

Overall this was a decent film with good action and a well-crafted plot. It did slowdown in parts, but it still manages to keep the story interesting. A good rental or purchase if you like Chinese action films.",1424131200,4,3255,4.661431064572426
6255434,4,B00IA337AY,"it was a pretty good movie,
some parts were a little confusing at times,
I admit it felt a little bit like a B list movie with the way it was shot, especially for a movie rekeased in 2014,
but I guess that's just the way China makes movies,
still worth a watch though",1421452800,,267,3.962962962962963
6255435,3,B00IA337AY,I can't figure out if this movie is really good or really bad. What is bad is it is way too long. The plot does keep you guessing at times. Typical Korean fight scenes...real well done.,1420329600,,185,4.166666666666667
6255436,3,B00IA337AY,I am totally confused about this title because this is more of a love story than anything else. So if you are not expecting plenty of action you might actually enjoy the storyline. This is a film about a group of people that have lived their lives avoiding the tyranny that was happening all around them. Then the tyranny finally came knocking at their front door. The actors are convincing in their roles and will carry you through the storyline.,1419811200,2,447,4.6
6255437,5,B00IA337AY,VERY VERY VERY GOOOOOODDDDD MOVIE. I LOVED THIS MOVIE!! I wish to thank one comment made on my edited review. yep.

6255438,4,B00IA337AY,"I've seen many a period piece where the historical value and lessons of the tale being presented shines through overall. I've seen many a documentary where the story isn't about the characters that played a part to insure that history was made but just the fact that history was made. This movie ""7 Assassins"" is something completely different yet still the same in some parts. First off the title was wrong! This movie had nothing to do with killers just people trying to do the right thing despite a corrupt goverment. Second, this movie looks, acts, and feels more like a spaghetti western than a run of the mill documentary. Third, its not until the movie is actually over before you discover that it had any historical value at all! The actual story for the movie is as follows: A band of freedom fighters led by a guy named ""Tieyung"" (something like this?) has a cargo of gold in their possession. A corrupt Prince plans to kill Tieyung and take the gold. On a tip from the Comissioner, Tieyung is told to find a man named Master Mao to seek refuge. Its at this point where the movie somewhat leaves the action behind and you meet and come to respect Master Mao and all that he is! The heart of this movie lies in the lives of a community that Master Mao has created. You start to feel for the importance of every last character but within that feeling the movie turns into a soap opera/drama and at that point if you're a guy watching this alone then your thought is ""When is it going to be over!"" This movie can watched but it won't be respected because of its title. I say buy it not for the title but because of the sensitivity of the movie itself. Yes it has killing but keep in mind this is a movie where you feel for every life lost!",1413763200,,1746,4.342507645259939

Is it a western movie with guns and swords ???? rifles, machine guns, prince, ... the translation sucks.  Waste of my time watching this movie.  If you must watch this movie and there's no other choice... I suggest ... just fast forward to the fighting scenes... watch it and end it quickly.
